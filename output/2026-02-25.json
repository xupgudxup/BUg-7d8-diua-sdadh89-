    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers have clarified their position on Magic Johnson’s involvement and Rob Pelinka’s role within the organization.\n\nSpeculation has intensified about potential front office changes following recent restructuring behind the scenes.\n\nQuestions centred on whether a franchise legend could return in an official capacity and whether leadership at the basketball operations level would shift. The latest update provides firm answers on both fronts.\n\nIn comments shared by Dave McMenamin, the organization made its stance clear: “New Lakers president of business operations, Lon Rosen, told reporters this evening that Rob Pelinka will remain as the team’s president of basketball operations.”\n\nThe statement removes immediate uncertainty around Pelinka’s position and signals continuity within the basketball decision-making structure.\n\nDespite external noise and ongoing scrutiny of roster construction, the Lakers appear committed to stability at the top of their sporting hierarchy.\n\nThe same update added clarity regarding Earvin Magic Johnson’s involvement, noting: “…While Earvin Magic Johnson will surely be around the franchise, no official title is planned for him with LAL.”\n\nMagic Johnson remains one of the most influential figures in Lakers history, both as a player and former executive. However, the absence of an official title indicates that any presence will be informal rather than operational.\n\nThat distinction matters. While fan sentiment often leans towards symbolic reunions, the Lakers’ leadership structure appears defined and settled for now.\n\nPelinka retains authority over basketball matters, and Magic Johnson’s influence will exist outside the executive framework.\n\nThe message from Los Angeles is straightforward. Stability remains the priority, and any legacy involvement will not disrupt the current chain of command.\n\nSkip Bayless brands Luka Doncic ‘lousy’ as he slams LeBron James over ‘absurdly hard’ final play\n\nWhat LeBron James and Luka Doncic had to say about terrible miscommunication on final play vs. Magic\n\nNBA fans react to LeBron James linking up with Justin Bieber during LA Lakers’ recent game",

    "description": "FC Bayern + Harry Kane = Broken Records.",
    "fullText": "Not only does Harry Kane score goals for fun, he also breaks records for fun. This season, Kane became the fastest player to reach 20 goal contributions in Europe’s top five leagues, needing just 742 minutes, pipping Messi’s previous record of 749 in the 2011/12 season. The Englishman also scored his 100th goal for Bayern in 104 games, beating Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland as the fastest player to score 100 goals for one club. Kane is by no means a one-season-wonder either. He became the first player in the Bundesliga’s 60 year history to score over 20 goals in their first three seasons. And just in case that wasn’t enough, the Englishman has converted all 23 of his attempted spot-kicks—the longest 100% conversion rate in the league’s history.\n\nKane could make history once again in Bayern’s clash against bitter rivals, Borussia Dortmund. The Three Lions captain has scored multiple goals in each of his last three Bundesliga matches, a feat matched only by Gerd Müller and Robert Lewandowski—the latter scoring multiple goals in four consecutive games, a record Kane could equal.\n\n3 – For the third time, Bayern Munich’s Harry Kane scored multiple goals in three consecutive Bundesliga matches – in Bundesliga history, only Robert Lewandowski has done this more often (4 times), while Gerd Müller also achieved it 3 times. Triple.\n\nIt’s no secret Kane is slowly reeling Lewandowski’s Bundesliga goal record in, but equaling—and potentially breaking—another of the Pole’s records would be the cherry on top of what has already been a record-breaking, career-defining season.",

So, we’ll continue to work our way across the board and enjoy these meetings.”\n\nIt's important to note that the schedule likely has a lot to do with that singular focus, though some high-profile prospects have confirmed that they have met with the club: Texas A&M's Cashius Howell and Missouri's Zion Young.\n\nThe Patriots can meet with pretty much anyone they want at this point, with the final position group (offensive line) scheduled to be made available on Thursday, so it is notable that they continue to do work on prospects who could potentially solve their pass-rush problem throughout Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nWill it actually lead to a significant interest once the 2026 NFL Draft comes around in April?

    "fullText": "In its first year being held at Dover Motor Speedway, the NASCAR All-Star Race now has a format to be contested under the shadow of Miles the Monster.\n\nAnd this one is going to be a marathon that requires a good bit of arithmetic.\n\nFirst and foremost, there will no longer be an ‘open’ race for drivers not already locked-in to race their way into the decisive segment of the event. With modern Dover races being 400 laps, NASCAR landed on 350 to honor those who annually attend at The Monster Mile.\n\nEvery driver that enters the All-Star Race will start the event but there are already 17 drivers currently locked into the third and final stage of the event -- William Byron, Kyle Larson, Christopher Bell, Denny Hamlin, Chase Elliott, Tyler Reddick, Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano, Austin Cindric, Ryan Blaney, Josh Berry, Austin Dillon, Chase Briscoe, Ross Chastain, Shane Van Gisbergen, Bubba Wallace and Kyle Busch.\n\nThe eligibility is determined by the following criteria:\n\n·         Winners of points paying races in 2025 or 2026\n\n·         Previous All Star Race winners still racing full-time\n\n·         Previous NASCAR Cup Series champions still racing full-time\n\nThe final stage will include 26 drivers racing for the $1 million prize. The combined results of stage 1 and 2 will get the field to 25 drivers with the 26th and final spot being awarded to the traditional fan vote winner.\n\nAfter the first stage, which is 75 laps, NASCAR will invert the top-26 finishers meaning that 26th will start first for the second stage and 25th will start second and so-forth. After the next 75 laps., which is the second stage, the lowest combined finishing positions from both segments will determine the starting lineup for the final 200 lap segment.\n\nDrivers already locked-in cannot be eliminated. Up to the 25th starting spot will be determined by the drivers not yet locked-in. The starting lineup for the final segment will be determined by average finish across the first two stages.\n\nQualifying on Saturday will set the starting lineup for the first stage. The pit crew contest will also continue to be part of the qualifying format.\n\nDrivers will take the green flag, run one full lap at speed, and on the second lap proceed to the designated pit stall for a four-tire stop with no fuel. Once the stop has been completed, the car will take off from the stall and race to the checkered flag. The qualifying time will be the total elapsed time from green flag to checkered flag, with the fastest team earning the pole position for the race.\n\nThe pit crew contest winner will be determined by the fastest pit stop, with timing line established as one box behind and one box ahead of the NASCAR-designated pit stop box. The results of the pit crew contest will determine pit box selection for the race on Sunday.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "A towering rookie season puts Brewers' Jacob Misiorowski in the national spotlight originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJacob Misiorowski first started to make a name for himself as a high school athlete in Missouri. By his junior year, he was throwing bullpens in front of MLB scouts.\n\nGoing into his senior year, his baseball season would be cancelled due to COVID-19, and the shortened draft that year did not help the hard-throwing righty's chances.\n\nHe would go on to play college baseball at Crowder College. After redshirting his freshman year, he was lights out in 2022 and threw another bullpen in front of big league scouts, where he averaged 99.8 mph.\n\nMORE: Brewers should cash in on their Mets connection to land a 27-homer threat\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers, being impressed with the easy velocity, selected him with the 63rd overall pick in the 2022 MLB Draft, and he started to fly up the prospect ranking.\n\nLast year, he sat as the club's No. 3 prospect, and he would go on to make his MLB debut in June.\n\nHe was fantastic last season. He appeared in 15 games, putting together a 5-3 record with a 4.36 ERA, which led to him being voted an All-Star last season.\n\nHe will be one to watch, especially with Freddy Peralta gone. Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter has faith he can continue to dominate and tags him as the 20th best player under 25 years old.\n\n\"It was an up-and-down first big league season for Misiorowski, highlighted by a surprise All-Star selection and a stellar run as a multi-inning reliever in October. The towering 6'7\" right-hander now looks like the clear No. 2 on the Milwaukee staff following the Freddy Peralta trade, and he is more than capable of answering the bell.\"\n\nHowever, if Misiorowski wants to serve as a legitimate No. 2, he needs to work on his walk rate and develop a third pitch. He finished the year hovering around an 11 percent walk rate, while hitters will key in on him being a primary two-pitch pitcher.\n\nLimiting his walks and continuing to work on his changeup could really put him in a different tier when it comes to young arms.\n\nThe White Sox's future is looking bright with Colson Montgomery leading the way\n\nThe Giants could target this Mariners breakout candidate to insure Luis Arraez\n\nThe missing left-handed weapon the Diamondbacks need to pair with Brandyn Garcia\n\nProposed trade idea sees Reds landing Angels offensive powerhouse\n\nRangers urged to pounce on Twins All-Star starter before Opening Day",

    "fullText": "10 Prospects Patriots Should Watch For At 2026 NFL Scouting Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's the most wonderful time of the year!\n\nThe New England Patriotshave officially started preparations for the 2026 NFL Draft, as they’ll spend the remainder of the week getting eyes on the best and brightest of the upcoming class out at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis — the schedule of which is as follows:\n\n2026 NFL Scouting Combine\nThursday, Feb. 26 (3-8 p.m. ET): DL, LB\nFriday, Feb. 27 (3-8 p.m. ET): DB, TE\nSaturday, Feb. 28 (1-8 p.m. ET): QB, WR, RB\nSunday, March 1 (1-5 p.m. ET): OL\n\nMike Vrabel and Eliot Wolf both spoke before on-field workouts began on Thursday, and helped give some clues as to what they’ll be looking for out of prospects that will take the field over the weekend.\n\nIt’s clear that there will be a focus on adding athleticism and pass-rush production on the defensive side of the ball, while some specific spots on the roster are clearly in need of an influx of talent — which brings us to these players in particular that the organization should keep an eye on:\n\nHilton was supposed to be in first-round conversations, as he began his collegiate career rated ahead of Malik Nabers, Brian Thomas Jr. and Jack Bech when they all arrived on campus at LSU in 2021 -- as well as future first-round picks Xavier Worthy and Marvin Harrison Jr.\n\nIt's safe to say that didn't happen, though you can't necessarily blame the player.\n\nHilton dealt with several injuries that ultimately ended three of his five seasons, but his elite track background (three-time state champion high jumper in Louisiana) and potential to come away from this event with the fastest 40-yard dash time (clocked at 22.13 mph in 2024) make him one of the most fascinating prospects who will work out this weekend. It's believed that he could rocket up draft boards with an elite performance, though he's still likely to be available on Day 3.\n\nNew England needs to add proven production at wide receiver, but after they do that, perhaps there's value in rolling the dice on someone who never quite lived up to the expectations set out for him at LSU -- after all, it did work out pretty well with Kayshon Boutte.\n\nNo, this isn't going to turn into one of those jokes about how a certain type of wide receiver always seems to find success at One Patriot Place...\n\nWetjen might kind of look like Julian Edelman, Wes Welker, Danny Amendola and Efton Chism III, but you aren't drafting him with the expectation that he'll turn into your next great slot receiver -- he'd make the roster based off his special teams acumen alone.\n\nWetjen is built like a running back (5-foot-9, 196 pounds) and listed as a wide receiver (23 career receptions), but his value comes in the kicking game. Iowa has sort of made a name developing guys like this, but there's no doubt who has been the best of the best, with the hybrid kick/punt returner leading the nation with 1,203 kick return yards, 891 punt return yards and six total return touchdowns across 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe Patriots need somebody to return kicks after releasing Antonio Gibson and presumably saying goodbye to D'Ernest Johnson, especially if there is still some trepidation about filling that role with the likes of TreVeyon Henderson or Kyle Williams. I can't imagine someone better suited for the role than this young man.\n\nHE'S GONE‼️\n\nKaden Wetjen returns it 8️⃣5️⃣ yards for the @HawkeyeFootball TD.#B1GFootball on @BigTenNetwork 📺 pic.twitter.com/GJDJevZTV5\n\n— Big Ten Football (@B1Gfootball) October 26, 2024\n\nIT'S TIME TO INVEST AT TIGHT END!\n\nHunter Henry was really good this past season, but he's entering the final year of his contract and is on the wrong side of 30. Austin Hooper is going to be an unrestricted free agent, and is on the wrong side of 30. Jack Westover is going to be a restricted free agent, and perhaps the only reason he'll be back is because he is on the right side of 30.\n\nIt's genuinely insane that this organization hasn't thought about life after it moves on from this current crop of talent at the position...\n\nI'd imagine they finally invest heavily at the position this offseason, something that was referred to by Vrabel on Wednesday, which means signing one of the many good options available in free agency (Isaiah Likely, David Njoku, Cade Otton and Chig Okonkwo) and drafting someone who could potentially develop into the future top option.\n\nKoziol is as good an option as any, as he possesses good size (6-foot-6, 245 pounds), has been productive (168 receptions and 14 touchdowns across 2024 and 2025) and would likely fall into your lap in the middle rounds (No. 3 TE, according to ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.). I don't think he's going to transform the way this team plays football, but he's a functional second option at the position... and you need one of those.\n\nBentley is another good option if you're just looking for a high-floor guy who can play behind someone else, though he could give you a bit more of a bang for your buck.\n\nBentley exploded onto the scene this past season, finishing with 46 receptions, 620 receiving yards and six touchdowns -- just barely scraping by his previous career total of 3-20-0. Utah helped him put it all together by getting him the ball on underneath routes and allowing him to showcase his abilities after the catch, which is extremely impressive for someone who checks in at 6-foot-3, 262 pounds.\n\nHow many people can do a backflip at that size?\n\nI've seen teams fall in love with a lot less.\n\nIf you're looking for functional athleticism, this is your guy.\n\nLouis will test well over the weekend, but nothing he does will be all that surprising given what we've seen in game situations: he once blocked an extra point and returned it for the rare two-point conversion, had six interceptions and double-digit sacks across the last two seasons, was clocked as the fastest player on his team, etc.\n\nThe Patriots need to add speed to the second level and quite literally can't do any better than this hybrid player who has displayed shades of greatness.\n\nPerkins actually might be faster...\n\nIt's really difficult to evaluate him, however, as he has been insanely productive when healthy (35.5 tackles for loss, 17.0 sacks, five interceptions) but also has a season-ending injury under his belt and is extremely undersized (6-foot, 222 pounds).\n\nThe NFL very rarely gets it right with those kinds of players, but you can bet that someone will think they can figure it out given his undeniable talent. If they're right, they'll look like geniuses. If they're wrong, well... we'll all point and laugh.\n\n4️⃣ sacks\n2️⃣ forced fumbles\n\nHarold Perkins Jr. is a PROBLEM 😤 @LSUfootballpic.twitter.com/KxSOEvdC3f\n\n— SEC Network (@SECNetwork) November 12, 2022\n\nHill will almost certainly be gone by the time the Patriots are picking at No. 63, as he falls under the category of surefire starter at an undervalued position. It's the absolute worst place to be for a prospect (less money, virtually no guarantees) and the best place to be for a team (less money, virtually no guarantees).\n\nIf they're feeling like trading back, however...\n\nHill has enough versatility to drop back into coverage while occasionally rushing the passer, though that archetype often gets teams into trouble as they try to pigeonhole those players into pure pass-rush roles. Micah Parsons is an example of someone who that worked with. Edgerrin Cooper, Troy Andersen, Jamin Davis and Kenneth Murray are examples of the opposite.\n\nI'd imagine you've heard this name before.\n\nYoung is that guy who has been linked to New England ever since folks started really paying attention to prospects following Super Bowl LX.\n\nIt's safe to say there is no bigger need than the addition of pass-rush production, and no one really seems to care how they go about obtaining it -- whether that be trading for someone like Maxx Crosby, signing someone like Trey Hendrickson or letting the chips fall where they may and drafting one of the options that remains available during the second round like Young.\n\nIf you want to swing for the fences, this is the guy you do it for...\n\nFaulk will likely be gone by the time the Patriots pick at No. 31, but there could be opportunities to move up and grab -- or sit and wait for -- someone who looks (6-foot-6, 290 pounds)and acts (16.0 tackles for loss and 9.0 sacks across 2024 and 2025) the part.\n\nFaulk isn't the flashiest option, but his versatility and ability to be disruptive on every single down is really exciting to think about -- especially if you can envision what it would look like alongside Crosby/Hendrickson, Milton Williams and Christian Barmore.\n\nMore NFL: Patriots Offseason Preview: Everything Team Must Address In 2026",

    "fullText": "A consortium led by former professional poker player James Bord has pulled out of a proposed £47.8m takeover of Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nThe consortium of Bord, Felix Romer and Alsharif Faisal Bin Jamil was named as the preferred bidder for the Championship club on 24 December.\n\n\"To all the long-suffering fans of this great club, it is with the greatest regret that we have decided not to pursue our bid to become your new custodians,\" said a statement released by the consortium on Wednesday.\n\n\"The historic mishandling of the club and pattern of catastrophic underinvestment means our sizeable binding bid can no longer be justified.\n\n\"We have spent over £4m to help run the club over the last two months and, after much consideration, have decided that we can no longer continue to do so.\n\n\"We know this will be a bitter disappointment to many – who hoped the ownership saga would soon be over – and for this we can only apologise wholeheartedly.\n\n\"We know the rest of your season is going to be challenging, as will the next, but you will rise again to your former glory and when you do, we will be cheering your success.\"\n\nThe Owls have been in administration since October after 10 years under the ownership of Dejphon Chansiri.\n\nThey were relegated from the Championship on Sunday following a 2-1 defeat at city rivals Sheffield United. It was the earliest-ever relegation in English football.\n\nAdministrators Begbies Traynor chose the Bord group after it paid a non-refundable deposit of £2.5m.\n\nThe trio have been going through the owners and directors' test with the EFL and the new Independent Football Regulator since then.\n\nBBC Sport understands the due diligence process had been particularly challenging.\n\nSignificant amounts of documentation was still outstanding at the time the preferred bidder withdrew.\n\nIt has been funding the club's losses since then to the tune of about £1m a month.\n\nA further payment was due this week to extend the preferred bidder status by a further two weeks.\n\nBut the group has pulled out because the club's valuation is now considered to be lower than the £47.8m originally offered and the consortium are unable to negotiate down, as per the terms of their agreement.\n\nIt leaves administrators needing to find another buyer.\n\nIn a statement, Sheffield Wednesday's joint administrators said: \"The withdrawal of this bidder does not mean we are returning to the beginning of the process.\n\n\"We have already been contacted by other parties who previously participated in the sales process and who have reiterated their interest in acquiring the club.\n\n\"We are therefore moving immediately to re-engage with those bidders under a new expedited timetable.\"\n\nAdding that the focus on getting the club out of administration and securing its long-term future remains in place, it continued: \"We understand that this news will be disappointing and frustrating for supporters.\n\n\"However, the club remains operational, funded for the remainder of the season, and interest in the acquisition remains active.\"\n\nBBC Sport understands the Bord bid was significantly higher than any other interested parties - and that no other bid matched the requirement for 25p in the pound for creditors.\n\nIf the new owners do not pay 25p in the pound, the EFL's insolvency policy states the club must start the following season with a 15-point deduction.\n\nThe Owls have already been docked 18 points this season for financial infringements under Chansiri.\n\nFormer Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, who at one stage was involved in a consortium which was considering a bid, says that automatic 15-point penalty should be challenged.\n\nOn Tuesday, another consortium led by American businessman David Storch stated it was still interested.\n\n\"We remain incredibly passionate about the opportunity at Sheffield Wednesday and seeing the club return to its former glory,\" the statement read.\n\n\"We wish the preferred bidder well through the process but are ready to step in should the opportunity present itself again.\n\n\"We know all are disappointed by relegation yet wish the team well as they finish the current season.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Fantasy Football Video: Which team might benefit the most by signing free agent QB Malik Willis?",
    "description": "Matt Harmon, Justin Boone and Jori Epstein discuss the pending free agency of QB Malik Willis and where his best fit would be for fantasy football.",
    "fullText": "The QB market this offseason is looking pretty thin as we approach NFL free agency, which is set to begin on March 11 with the legal tampering period opening on March 9. One of the top names on the signal-caller list is Malik Willis, who has spent the past two seasons as Jordan Love’s backup on the Green Bay Packers.\n\nReports are suggesting Willis could get at least $30 million per season on his next contract. That would put him at the low-end among starting veteran QBs, just below names like Baker Mayfield and Super Bowl champion Sam Darnold.\n\nWe’ve seen Willis perform well in a small sample filling in for Love, making three spot starts while appearing in 11 total games. In those appearances, Willis has posted great numbers, including a 134.6 passer rating and 78.7 completion percentage on just 89 attempts. He has also carried the ball 42 times for 261 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nWill an opportunity to start for a new team give Willis the tools to be a top fantasy football contributor in 2026? Matt Harmon and Justin Boone are joined by Yahoo senior NFL reporter Jori Epstein at the scouting combine to discuss Willis’ future on the latest Yahoo Fantasy Forecast.\n\nEpstein immediately points to Miami as a potential match, looking like “Packers South” after hiring former Green Bay DC Jeff Hafley as head coach after the season. Former Packers exec John Eric Sullivan was also hired as general manager, so both are familiar with Willis from their time in Green Bay.\n\nThe Dolphins would have to move on from QB Tua Tagovailoa, who was benched late in 2025 and has had serious injury issues throughout his NFL career. He’s also on a lofty contract Miami could try and get out from under.\n\nThe other team Epstein mentions is the Arizona Cardinals, who just hired Mike LaFleur, brother of Packers head coach Matt LaFleur. The Cardinals have a similar situation with their incumbent QB in Kyler Murray, who was essentially benched for Jacoby Brissett last season. Murray is also expected not to return to Arizona similar to Tua in Miami. If that’s the case, Mike could call up his brother and get some intel on Willis as a potential starter.\n\nBoone points out that Arizona wasn’t very good last season, which resulted in Brissett having to throw the ball a ton. He attempted just over 40 passes per game in 12 starts. That volume really buoyed TE Trey McBride, leading to his mammoth season, along with other pass-catchers like Michael Wilson. If Willis is the starting QB, that would likely mean regression for Cardinals’ pass-catchers.\n\nHarmon questions both teams’ ability to eat so much dead cap space if they end up cutting ties with their respective QBs in Murray and Tagovailoa, which could make it tough to then go and sign Willis. But there are also ties with Cardinals GM Monti Ossenfort, who was with the Tennessee Titans when the team drafted Willis in the third round in 2022.\n\nWherever Willis lands, it will have fantasy ramifications for his new teammates and how we view them in 2026 drafts.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs will have to make do without one of their offseason signings for an extended period of time.\n\nAccording to Maddie Lee of the Chicago Sun-Times, Cubs manager Craig Counsell told reporters that first baseman/outfielder Tyler Austin will be out for \"months\" following surgery on his patellar tendon in his right knee.\n\nAustin, 34, signed a one-year contract with Chicago in December after a six-year stint with the Yokohama DeNA BayStars in Nippon Professional Baseball. He made his Major League debut in 2016 with the New York Yankees, playing parts of three seasons with the AL East club.\n\nFrom 2018-19, Austin split time between the Minnesota Twins, San Francisco Giants, and Milwaukee Brewers. He compiled a .219/.292/.451 slash line with 33 home runs and a .743 OPS in 583 Major League plate appearances.\n\nAfter connecting for 85 homers across six seasons in NPB, Austin had a more than solid chance of breaking camp on the Cubs' Opening Day roster as bench depth.\n\nWithout a solidified backup first baseman behind Michael Busch, 22-year-old Moises Ballesteros emerges as one of Chicago's top options for the role. Outfielder and recent minor league signee Michael Conforto is also a candidate to take Austin's roster spot.\n\nConforto, 32, is coming off the worst season of his 10-year career, hitting just .199 with 12 home runs and a strikeout percentage of 24.9 in 138 games with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nChicago Cubs 32 home run slugger admits that he wants to sign new deal with club\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies fans will be ecstatic to hear latest Zack Wheeler injury update\n\nRoman Anthony reveals welcome to MLB moment, and it’ll actually make Boston Red Sox fans happy\n\nChicago Cubs and New York Yankees proposed trade moves on from Nico Hoerner for lackluster return\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal could end Anthony Volpe disaster by landing two-time Gold Glove winner who can also hit\n\nBoston Red Sox predicted to finally make $90 million decision after years of rumors",

    "description": "The Browns are looking at a full competition at quarterback this offseason.",
    "fullText": "The question of who will start at quarterback for the Cleveland Browns has a wrinkle to it: There’s a new coaching staff.\n\nThe staff that gave Shedeur Sanders seven starts last season when Sanders was a rookie is gone. Todd Monken, who was the Baltimore Ravens’ offensive coordinator last season, was hired to become Cleveland’s new head coach.\n\nThere’s a full offseason to go, in terms of acquiring new players in trades, free agency or the draft. The quarterback landscape in Cleveland could change. But Monken, meeting with the media at the NFL scouting combine on Wednesday, had positive things to say about Sanders.\n\n[Get more Browns news: Cleveland team feed]\n\n“I think what you see is elite playmaking ability,” Monken said at the combine. “That’s in him. You’ve seen it, we’ve seen it, you saw it in college, you saw it on tape last year. Sure there’s a ways to go, but what rookie isn’t? What first-year player doesn’t have a long way to go? I’m excited to get started with him and all of our quarterbacks and all of our players.”\n\nSanders was up and down as a rookie after a highly publicized fall in the draft. He had seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions, and general manager Andrew Berry pointed out at the combine on Tuesday that he had to cut down on mistakes.\n\nThat progression, and the Browns’ offseason moves, could determine if Sanders gets more starts next season. Monken said he didn’t think it was necessarily important to add more quarterbacks in the offseason, but he said the team will do it’s due diligence at the position.\n\nAs is, the team’s three options seem to be Sanders, fellow 2025 rookie Dillon Gabriel and Deshaun Watson, who the team refuses to rule out as an option.\n\n“I think anytime you have a player that at one time has exhibited the skill set at an elite level I think you’re always going to give them the benefit of the doubt that somehow we might be able to get that out of him again,” Monken said about Watson.\n\nThat’s not a great quarterback room, but the Browns also don’t have a great path to adding a better rookie quarterback in the draft, and there are limited options in free agency too.\n\nIf the Browns’ quarterback room doesn’t change, there’s clearly no leader at the moment to start next season.\n\n“Sure, I think it’s an open competition,” Monken said. “I don’t know why it wouldn’t be an open competition, and I don’t mean to say that harshly. But I don’t think there’s enough on film over the last couple of years one way or the other to say, ‘Boy, we have a starter at quarterback.’”\n\nThe Browns will evaluate whoever is on the roster over offseason practices and Monken said he’d like to have a starter in mind by training camp. But right now, he didn’t know if he’d be able to name a starter by then.\n\n“You would hope that’s the case, you’d hope that by the time you get to training camp, the reps you’re giving to a quarterback are for your starter,” Monken said. “Whether we get to that place, I don’t know. That will be determined in the offseason.”",

    "fullText": "The New York high school boys basketball 2025-26 campaign is closing in on the postseason.\n\nFor most of the New York high school boys basketball season, remaining at the top of the weekly rankings are the Archbishop Stepinac Crusaders, which are currently 22-4 on the season and are currently riding a 16-game winning streak. Besides the unstoppable Crusaders, but who else should we watch for out of New York when it comes to the state’s top high school boys basketball squads?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a way-too-early look at the top 25 teams in the country according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Feb. 25.\n\nThe Archbishop Stepinac Crusaders (22-4) haven’t lost a game since Dec. 27 to Montverde Academy (Fla.). This season, the Crusaders senior-laden bunch has led the way and shown off their talent in the front and back court. Senior four-star shooting guard Jasiah Jervis returns after averaging a team-high 16.2 points per game last season. The Crusaders will be tough to drive to the rim on as they have a pair of USC commits in 7-footers in Adonis and Darius Ratliff, respectively. Fordham commitment Hassan Koureissi pairs up with Jervis to create one of the best guard combos in the Northeast. The Crusaders last week notched a pair of blowout wins over Msgr Scanlan and Cardinal Hayes, which the latter was for the 2026 New York Diocesan Championship.\n\nThe Long Island Lutheran Crusaders (8-10) have been below the .500 mark the last few weeks, but have played some of the top competition in the country. What is obvious when taking a look at the talent pool the Crusaders possesses, this team can compete with practically anyone in the nation. Long Island Lutheran has multiple five-star talents in senior 6-foot-5 point guard Dylan Mingo and junior 6-foot-8 forward Moussa Kamissoko. Among other players folks need to have their eyes on that lace ’em up for the Crusaders are Cincinnati commitment Kayden Allen and North Texas pledge TJ Crumble. Long Island Lutheran lost a 66-63 heartbreaker to Brewster Academy (NH), but bounced back with a 57-50 win over Oak Hill Academy.\n\nThe Cardinal Hayes Cardinals (17-7) recently saw their three-game winning streak snapped against Holy Cross in a 67-52 decision. The Cardinals most impressive win of the season came against Iona Preparatory School in a 80-74 decision. The Cardinals saw their season come to an end in a 67-51 loss to Archbishop Stepinac for the 2026 New York Diocesan Championship.\n\nThe St. Francis Preparatory School Terriers (18-5) have continued with their winning ways as they return one of the more talented teams in the New York City region. Key players returning for the Terriers begins with Oesoemana Sacko, who is already committed to Fairfield University, and 6-foot-3 sophomore Justin DeSena. The Terriers’ only five losses on the season have come against Colorado’s No. 1 ranked Ralston Valley, No. 3 Christ The King Regional (twice), No. 6 Nazareth and No. 22 Msgr Scanlan, respectively. St. Francis Preparatory most recent game was a 101-98 loss to Christ The King Regional.\n\nThe Nazareth Kingsmen (17-8) of Brooklyn remains in the Top 5 of our latest New York high school boys basketball rankings, though their season came to an end last week in a loss to Holy Cross. Of Nazareth’s eight losses this season, two of them have come against Archbishop Molloy, but the Kingsmen were able to notch their first victory versus the Stanners. The Kingsmen recently notched an impressive 67-52 victory over No. 3 St. Francis Prep.\n\n6. Christ The King Regional Lions (14-10) \n7. Christian Brothers Academy Brothers (18-0)\n8. Westhill Warriors (17-2)\n9. Thomas Jefferson Campus Orange Wave (14-7)\n10. Iona Preparatory School Gaels (16-10) \n\n11. Albany Academy Cadets (3-1)\n12. St. Raymond For Boys Ravens (11-15)\n12. Fairport Red Raiders (17-1) \n14. Penfield Senior Patriots (15-1)\n15. Chaminade Flyers (15-4)\n\n16. St. John’s Prep Red Storm (16-2) \n17. Holy Trinity Diocesan Titans (16-3)\n18. Archbishop Molloy Stanners (14-12)\n19. Mamaroneck Tigers (15-3)\n20. Canarsie Wolfpack (14-5)\n\n21. Msgr Scanlan Crusaders (11-12)\n22. Columbia Grammar-prep School (9-0)\n23. Shaker Bison (15-4) \n24. Holy Cross Knights (11-17)\n25. Green Tech Charter Eagles (17-1)",

If there's time left on the clock, I'm taking you out of the fight,\" he added.\n\nThe 31-year-old - with 19 stoppages in 20 wins - will make the first defence of his WBO crown, having claimed the 'interim' title against Joseph Parker before being upgraded to full champion when Oleksandr Usyk vacated the belt.\n\nFormer IBF champion Dubois, 28, is coming off a devastating knockout loss to generational great Usyk last summer.\n\n\"If you look back, when it gets dicey, he's not up for it,\" Wardley said of Dubois, who has faced accusations of folding too easily in his three stoppage defeats.\n\nWednesday's news conference took place at Dutch Hall, a converted 16th-century church tucked away in the heart of the city.\n\nDubois - never one for lengthy monologues - kept his answers short and matter of fact.\n\nBut the Londoner was clear in his intention. \"Victory by knockout, by any means necessary,\" he said.\n\nWhen the fighters eventually stepped forward for the obligatory face-off, Dubois looked away first as Wardley smirked.\n\nMoments later Wardley extended his fist in a gesture of respect, but Dubois shook his head and refused to engage.\n\nBefore the face-off drama, a twitchy, stone-faced Dubois glanced around at the stained-glass windows as the managers went toe-to-toe backing their men.\n\nDubois' representative Sam Jones predicted his fighter would \"flatten\" Ipswich's Wardley in quick time.\n\nWardley's manager Michael Ofo responded in kind, saying Wardley would \"destroy Daniel Dubois early\".\n\nThe back-and-forth rumbled on, Wardley grinning as the volume increased.\n\nOfo referenced Dubois' team and the recent changes in his training set-up. After the loss to Usyk, Dubois - who has worked with five trainers in his pro career - briefly parted ways with coach Don Charles before swiftly reversing the decision.\n\n\"It's going to be hard for Daniel to overcome all the things going on in his camp,\" Ofo said.\n\n\"The only person over there should be Stan [Dubois' father] because we know he makes all the decisions.\"\n\nCharles responded that \"talk is cheap\" before launching into his own war of words.\n\nAfter all that verbal sparring, promoter Frank Warren restored a little order.\n\n\"The winner of this will be fighting in a big stadium fight,\" the Queensberry boss said.\n\n\"But to get there, they have to lace them up and we'll see who is the best on the night.\n\n\"Both camps are passionate about their fighters, so it has all the ingredients of an amazing event.\"\n\nYou are never going to get a stream of soundbites from Dubois, but he usually gives you one moment. Before facing Anthony Joshua in September 2024, he famously banged the table with his fist.\n\nThis time, he kept that same fist to himself - and that made just as many headlines.\n\nHe does not appear to relish the media spotlight and that was evident again. He looked reluctant during press duties before the news conference.\n\nWardley, meanwhile, is entirely at ease with the limelight and happy to trade lines.\n\nWhen the news conference started, there was more needle than many expected.\n\nBut strip all that away and this is a proper heavyweight fight. Credit to Wardley for selecting a high-risk opponent for his first defence. Credit to Dubois for swerving the easy payday after such a destructive loss to Usyk.\n\nIn just over 10 weeks, it will not be the managers talking but two heavyweight punchers in the ring, each boasting knockout ratios of 95%.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Pittsburgh ace Paul Skenes is learning about MLB's new ch the hard way.",
    "fullText": "In his first battle against the automated ball-strike system, Paul Skenes was no match for the robots.\n\nPitching his first inning of the spring as he ramps up for both the Pittsburgh Pirates and Team USA's World Baseball Classic squad, Skenes faced called strike challenges from Atlanta Braves batters on three occasions.\n\nAnd the Braves successfully challenged all three calls by homeplate umpire Chris Segal - and added another in the second inning.\n\nTwo of the overturns definitely made life more difficult for Skenes. Braves first baseman Matt Olson - one of the game's most disciplined hitters - challenged a 1-1 curveball that Segal called a strike, nicking the outside corner. Olson, a sheepish grin on his face, tapped his head just, you know, to see what happened.\n\nSure enough, Segal erred - by one-tenth of an inch, ABS ruled - and a 1-2 count became a 2-1 count. Olson went on to draw a two-out walk, illustrating how certain counts - such as 1-1 - are more pivotal and perhaps crucial to challenge.\n\nThusly emboldened, Jurickson Profar followed by challenging the first pitch - a 98.3 mph fastball seemingly on the outside corner. Segal? Wrong again, this time by a half-inch. And 0-1 became 1-0 and Profar drew a walk.\n\nOn challenge No. 3, Skenes finally took matters into his own hands. Jumping ahead 0-2 on Austin Riley, he fired a 99-mph fastball at the top of the zone. Segal punched Riley out - and Riley was tapping his helmet before Skenes could even think to trudge off the mound.\n\nCall overturned - a whole 1.5 inches above the zone.\n\nAt that point, the camera turned to Skenes' girlfriend, Livvy Dunne, in the stands at the Braves' CoolToday Park in North Port, Fla. She looked far more relieved when Skenes threw an almost identical pitch - just a smidge lower and in the zone.\n\nAnd Riley swung through it anyway.\n\nThe Braves' pedantry cost Skenes anywhere from three to 13 more pitches, finishing with 31 for the inning. Not necessarily what the Pirates or Skenes wanted.\n\nBut he still put up a zero and struck out two - proving robots can only break Skenes down so much.\n\nIn his second inning of work, Skenes was his own enemy, issuing walks to Mike Yastrzemski and Mauricio Dubón. Leadoff batter Ronald Acuña Jr. then challenged a fastball that ABS ruled was 1.5 inches outside.\n\nSkenes got Acuña on a pop-up, seemingly no worse for wear. Even if technology decreed he throw 46 pitches in two innings of work - not exactly the kind of efficiency he'd hoped for.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Paul Skenes victim of MLB's ABS challenge system in first spring start",

    "fullText": "Promising safety prospect named dream draft target for Dallas Cowboys originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThis offseason should be all about improving the defense for the Dallas Cowboys, both through free agency and via the draft.\n\nWhen it comes to the draft, there’s one particular player who has been identified as a fit for the Cowboys.\n\nTCU safety Bud Clark was recently named the dream draft target for the Cowboys this year by Gary Davenport of Bleacher Report.\n\nClark is coming off of his senior season at TCU where he was named Second-Team All-Big 12 for a second consecutive year. As a senior in 2025, Clark recorded 56 combined tackles, 7 passes defended, 4 interceptions and a sack.\n\n\"There's a clear priority for the Cowboys in 2026—fixing a defense that ranked 30th in yards allowed and was the only team in the league that surrendered over 30 points per game last season,\" Davenport wrote.\n\n\"Safety Bud Clark played a lot of football at TCU and was quite the ballhawk, logging 15 career interceptions. … The Cowboys need defenders who can play right away. Getting one early on Day 3 would be a gift.\"\n\nWhen asked to describe his game at the Senior Bowl earlier this month, Clark described a ball-hawking, durable defender with solid coverage skills.\n\n“I am durable and seem to be in the right places in order to make a play. For the past three years, I played every game. I love to hit, and I am good at it. My coverage skills are really good, too,” Clark said.\n\n“I love receivers who think they are going to end up being open deep. I can rule being a zone defender. I bat down a lot of balls and have had 15 interceptions in the last four years, so I pride myself on being around the ball.”\n\nSounds like exactly the type of player that the Cowboys should be looking to draft to strengthen the secondary.\n\nDallas Cowboys named best landing spot for All-Pro linebacker\n\nKey coach announces departure from Philadelphia Eagles\n\nDallas Cowboys' 2026 breakout candidate revealed by Pro Football Focus",

    "fullText": "Todd Monken: Shedeur Sanders 'elite playmaking' and Browns QB competition notes from NFL Combine originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs the NFL world gets ready to over analyze prospect workout drills at the Scouting Combine from Indianapolis this week, Cleveland Browns fans want to hear from their new head coach.\n\nTodd Monken spoke Wednesday at a Combine presser as he embarks on a juggernaut of a journey to rebuild this lethargic offense. Ranked 31st in points-per-game last season, the new skipper noted in his introduction meeting with the media after getting hired, that his goal is to “score points any way possible.”\n\nA huge part of any offensive success of course revolves around the starting quarterback. Unsurprisingly, many of the questions flying at the podium to Monken revolved around who would be under center.\n\nHere are the most important questions asked, and Monken’s answers:\n\nMore: Browns mock draft round-up: Experts stun with surprise defender & rising OL star\n\nQ- What has your evaluation of Shedeur Sanders been?\n\nMonken- “Elite playmaking ability. We saw it on tape, saw it last year, saw it college. Sure there’s a way to go, but what rookie doesn’t. I’m excited about Shedeur and all our quarterbacks”\n\nQ- How do you intend on distributing reps for quarterbacks in training camp?\n\nMonken- “You would hope that by training camp the majority of reps go to your starter…but we won’t know how that plays out until we get there.”\n\nQ- Will it be an open competition for starting quarterback?\n\nMonken- “Sure. I think it’s an open competition. I don’t know why it wouldn’t be. I don’t think there’s enough on film one way or the other to feel that we know who our starter is.”\n\nMonken- “Any time you have a player who at one time played at an elite level, you give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can get that back. So he’ll get a chance. I don’t decide who plays, the players decide who plays…I’m excited to work with him, and excited to work with all our players.”\n\nQ- Does he think the starting QB could come from outside the organization?\n\nMonken- “The answer could be externally, I don’t know, we’ll do our due diligence and have to see.”\n\nQ- What is the “it factor” when you’re looking at quarterbacks coming out of the draft?\n\nMonken- “Have to vet people that have been around them for an extended period of time. Having a 20-minute interview (at the Combine) with a player isn’t nearly enough. How are they in a two-minute drill? Around teammates? Those answers are all important.”\n\nQ- Have you had a chance to study Ty Simpson, and what your thoughts are on him coming out in the draft?\n\nMonken- I like Ty a lot. Really good football player. His father was a Southern Miss alum, where I was head coach, so got to know him a little bit.\n\nThe head coach also was asked about what he’s looking for in offensive linemen since currently the Browns don’t have one starter from 2025 signed. “Most of all I’m looking for someone who’s physically tough and consistent. Everything else can be coached up if they are willing.”\n\nOne more piece of housekeeping is that assistant defensive line is the last coaching position that Monken has to fill out on his staff.\n\nThe new HC presented himself in a poised, confident manner. Now it’ll be up to GM Andrew Berry to give Monken the ingredients to cook up an explosive offense.\n\nNFL Combine tracker: 3 safeties the Browns must watch (who aren't Caleb Downs)\n\nDom Capers to Cleveland: What adding the legendary coach means for Browns 2026 defense\n\nTodd Monken’s ‘secret fix’ for Jerry Jeudy and Isaiah Bond: The Browns Zay Flowers strategy\n\nTop 3 tight end prospects to replace David Njoku: Browns must-watch list at 2026 NFL Combine\n\nMyles Garrett help?

    "fullText": "Giacomo Agostini says Marc Marquez has no intention of sticking around in MotoGP if he can’t compete for wins.\n\nHe’s now the strong favourite heading into the 2026 season. A title win would draw him level with Agostini atop the premier-class leaderboard, each with eight championships. However, Agostini’s overall record of 15 Grand Prix titles still seems out of reach.\n\nEven though Marquez is now 33 and one of the older riders on the grid, there’s little talk about retirement any time soon.\n\nThe path forward seems clear enough. A new deal with Ducati is expected soon, and it likely won’t be his last contract. There’s also growing belief that he may want to finish his career back where it began, at Honda.\n\nAgostini shared a conversation with Marquez that had stayed with him during an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nWhile many riders on the grid would love to be fighting for top-five finishes right now, Marquez said he would ‘retire’ if that’s all he could achieve, rather than podiums, wins or titles.\n\nAsked how Marquez ‘makes the difference’, Agostini replied: “With his mentality. He’s a rider who wants to win at all costs.\n\n“One day, talking to him, he told me that if he had to fight for 5th or 6th place, he’d retire. For Marquez, the minimum goal is the podium.”\n\nThe Spaniard is targeting his 100th Grand Prix win in Thailand this weekend and could also surpass Valentino Rossi’s premier-class benchmark of 89 this year (he currently has 73).\n\nMarquez spoke recently about his plans for the future and made it clear that whenever he loses pace with the front of the pack, that’s when he’ll step away from racing.\n\nAgostini, speaking to Gazzetta dello Sport, recalled a conversation with Marquez that stuck with him.

    "description": "Duguay’s family recently launched a GoFundMe fundraiser to cover medical expenses",
    "fullText": "Former New York Rangers player Ron Duguay has been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, and his family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover his medical expenses.\n\nThe hockey legend’s two daughters wrote in the fundraiser’s description that their father — who is currently dating former Alaska governor Sarah Palin — would never normally ask for help, “but after many conversations as a family, we decided to create this fundraiser for him because we’ve seen firsthand the weight this battle has placed on him, both physically and financially.”\n\nDuguay, 68, told Page Six that his cancer started in his colon, resulting in the removal of his appendix and gallbladder.\n\n“I find it extremely hard asking for funds for all these costs I’m going through,” he told the publication. “Normally, I’m helping others.”\n\nThe GoFundMe description explained that the money would go toward travel, treatments, holistic care and potential new treatments.\n\n“Earlier in his treatment journey, the care he received in Florida nearly cost him his life. That led us to bring him to Orange County, where my sister and I live, so he could receive treatment here,” the page reads, as it was noted that Duguay flies from Florida to Orange County, California, every two weeks for treatment.\n\n“The cost of constant travel, along with medical care, holistic therapies, supplements, and alternative healing approaches he has committed to, has become extremely overwhelming financially.”\n\nThe post continued: “Recently, his cancer numbers have started to rise again, and while he continues his current treatments, we are now exploring additional treatment options outside of the United States in hopes of giving him the best possible chance. These treatments are very expensive and add another layer of financial strain during an already difficult time.”\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the fundraiser has earned over $54,000.\n\nDuguay shares his two adult daughters, Shay Thomas and Amber Stavros, with his first wife, Robin Bobo. He also has a son, Noah, 32, with his second wife, Kim Alexis.\n\nOn Tuesday, Thomas posted a montage of clips to Instagram of her father throughout the treatment process, including some clips with his girlfriend, Palin, 62.\n\nThe politician discussed her boyfriend’s illness previously during an April 2025 defamation retrial against The New York Times over a 2017 editorial in New York City. At the time, the press asked her where Duguay was as she responded, “Oh, he’s battling a health issue right now, but otherwise very well.”\n\nWhile Duguay initially played for the Rangers from 1977 to 1983, throughout his 12-season career, he also played for the Red Wings, Kings and Penguins, earning a total of 274 goals and 346 assists. Following his hockey career, he called Ranger games on MSG Network for 12 years before the network dismissed him in 2018.",

Scheffler does not.\n\nNo, Scheffler isn't playing this week at the Cognizant Classic.\n\nThat opens up the tournament to a potentially different batch of favorites. When Scheffler plays, he's always a heavy betting favorite to win.\n\nScheffler played each of the past three weeks, placing third at the WM Phoenix Open, fourth at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and 12th at the Genesis Invitational.\n\nScheffler is slated to play two tournaments in March.\n\nThe first is the Arnold Palmer Invitational, which begins on March 5.\n\nThe other is the following week, with The Players Championship starting on March 12.\n\nThe Masters is April 9, and it wouldn't be surprising if Scheffler added in one more tournament before that one.\n\nMORE: Lakers facing a very specific LeBron, Luka, Reaves problem",

    "fullText": "You’re probably familiar with vibe coding — the practice of describing what you want in plain English and letting an AI write the code. In this article we show how the concept translates to databases using the Agent Mode feature of TypeDB Studio.\n\nVibe querying is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of writing this:\n\nGet all people with their names and emails.\n\nThe AI reads your database schema, understands the structure of your data, and generates TypeQL in the chat. You click Run, and the results appear inline in your chat window.\n\nWhy use Agent Mode in TypeDB Studio? Agent mode can be used for asking questions about your database, building your schema and querying your data – all the essential day-to-day DB operations. It’s particularly useful for:\n\nOverall it’s just a more hassle-free way to build with TypeDB.\n\nThe easiest way to try this is to boot up a free TypeDB Cloud cluster with the social-network sample dataset preloaded; alternatively you can also initialise it in TypeDB CE (Cloud page / CE setup guide)\n\nSuppose this is your first time browsing the social network dataset. You probably want to get the lay of the land. Ask the AI agent “what’s in my schema?” and it will come up with a detailed description you can read.\n\nBehind the scenes, TypeDB Studio has attached the schema as context to the LLM that powers agent mode, which has attempted to decipher the schema for the user (you).\n\nI am a visual learner – so had to give this one a try.\n\nNot exactly Picasso – but successful nonetheless; agent mode can indeed render your schema as ASCII art.\n\nBefore agent mode: poke around in schema, scratch head, read docs, do actual hard work.\n\nAfter agent mode: “Hey benevolent AI bot, could you just dream up some interesting queries for me?”\n\nNot bad – its top three suggestions are simple enough:\n\nLet’s go ahead and run the second of these queries – showing a ‘contact card’ per person:\n\nCool. We have our contact cards! That being said, there’s a lot of nulls. Is the query definitely correct?\n\nLet’s hop back to the log output view for now. Remember that magic wand icon in the top right? Click that, and you’ll automagically send a new message containing the full log. The agent attempts to interpret these results. In the case of a successful query, it’ll typically suggest follow-up queries you could run. In the case of an error, it’ll try to diagnose the error and come up with a fixed query.\n\nIn this case when we send back the query, it suggests several follow-up queries, one of which is indeed a sanity check on whether any phone numbers exist at all in our dataset. It turns out they do not, so the phone property is largely for illustrative purposes.\n\nLLMs are genuinely impressive these days – and TypeDB’s AI agent is backed by GPT-5.2, a very powerful model. It still gets things wrong sometimes, though. Consider the following generated query:\n\nAt first the AI agent generates a query based on the idea of using subqueries inside a fetch, but unfortunately this returns a syntax error. We click the “magic wand” icon in the top right of the log, and this happens …\n\nThe agent tries a different approach and writes a correct query.\n\nThe “Fix with AI” button isn’t limited to Agent Mode. If you’re using the Query page to write TypeQL yourself, and you get an error – or an unexpectedly empty result set – you can hit “Fix with AI” (the magic wand button) and it’ll send the query log to a new Agent Mode conversation and have the agent describe what it thinks might be wrong.\n\nLLMs are perfectly capable of generating database queries in SQL, Cypher, and so on.\n\nFrom our research so far we’ve found that TypeDB Studio is a trailblazer in its early release of a fully-integrated AI assistant. Unlike other data platforms, the Studio agent is always aware of your data context (your schema) – and it allows you to actually run queries without leaving the assistant chat – a streamlined and better user experience.\n\nAgents that deal with complexity fail in predictable ways when they lack semantic grounding. They create invalid states. They make assumptions about the definitions and structures of concepts when there isn’t a clear, semantically rich schema setting those things out.\n\nTypeDB exhibits the following properties that are all of great value to an AI agent:\n\nYou can learn more about the power of semantic richness in: Why agents need ontologies\n\nAgent mode provides a totally new way of interacting with TypeDB. Its self-healing capabilities allow it to easily fix mistakes providing for an overall smooth experience. You don’t need prior knowledge of TypeQL – just ask questions in natural language and get answers.\n\nHere are some quick links to get up and running with TypeDB Studio and with vibe querying and to learn more:",

    "description": "Mystery specialists from Middle East recruited to construct underground routes, The Telegraph can reveal",
    "fullText": "Russia is sending migrants through underground tunnels from Belarus into Europe as part of its hybrid war on the West.\n\nBelarus, a Russian puppet state led by dictator Alexander Lukashenko, has used specialists from the Middle East with “a high level of expertise” to design the tunnels, Polish officials have told The Telegraph.\n\nThe Great Escape-style tactic marks a new escalation in the Kremlin’s hybrid war on Europe, in which Minsk has tried to send tens of thousands of migrants across Poland’s eastern frontier.\n\nPolish officials said the specialists who designed and dug the tunnels had a “high level of expertise”.\n\nAnd while experts say it is hard to be sure which groups were involved, they have suggested Kurdish fighters, Islamic State and Iranian-backed proxies as potential culprits.\n\nPoland has also suggested that Belarus resorted to hiring the mysterious Middle Eastern specialists because it was seeking new and more inventive methods of sneaking migrants across the border.\n\n“Officers of the Podlaskie Border Guard Unit have uncovered a total of four tunnels under the border with Belarus, all in 2025,” Lt Col Katarzyna Zdanowicz, from the Polish border force, told The Telegraph.\n\n“Physical and electronic security measures at the border, such as thermal imaging cameras and detection systems, allow us to immediately respond to any attempted violations of the state border, even underground ones,” he added.\n\nPolish authorities discovered one of the largest tunnels, near the village of Narewka in eastern Poland, in mid-December.\n\nIt was used by a total of 180 migrants, mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the majority of them arrested after they emerged on the other side.\n\nAccording to Poland, the tunnel was 1.5m high with the entrance on the Belarusian side hidden in a forest. The tunnel ran for around 50 metres on the Belarusian side of the border and for 10 metres on the Polish side.\n\nPolish police also released images of some of the 130 migrants who were arrested after emerging from the tunnels.\n\nVideo footage of the tunnel itself shows a narrow crawlspace-like structure, with concrete struts fixed to the sides to prevent it from collapsing.\n\nMilitary experts say the only Middle Eastern groups known to be capable of such tunnels are Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah in Lebanon, certain factions in Kurdistan, and possibly Islamic State.\n\nDr Lynette Nusbacher, an American military historian and strategist, said it was “plausible” that Iranian-backed groups such as Hezbollah might be the culprits.\n\n“One of the things we immediately saw after the 2006 Lebanon war was parades of cement mixers queuing up in southern Lebanon...we were seeing loads and loads of Iranian tunnel construction,” she said.\n\n“We also have ample evidence of Hamas doing the same thing in Gaza. So if you want that deep tunnelling expertise, then the answer to your question is going to be with Middle Easterners.”\n\nMajor Rob Campbell, a fortifications expert and former British Army sapper, also said Hamas was a possible culprit after reviewing footage of the tunnels in Poland.\n\n“If I had to speculate, experts from the Middle East would be Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad,” he said, referring to another Palestinian faction in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSarit Zehavi, a former Israeli intelligence colonel, said Iranian-backed proxies were just one of several possible explanations.\n\n“Does Hezbollah or any Iranian proxies have this capability? Yes. Are they the only ones? No. Probably others also have the knowledge, from Kurdish militias in Syria to Isis,” she said.\n\nMarcin Kierwiński, a Polish official, has previously said that some of the tunnellers came from Kurdistan, but added that Poland ultimately holds the Belarusian regime responsible.\n\nLast month, Al-Jazeera, the Qatari broadcaster, reported the discovery of a vast network of tunnels below the Syrian city of Raqqa, which had been dug by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).\n\nUnder Lukashenko, who has ruled for more than 30 years, Belarus has played an active role in Putin’s attempts to destabilise the West via waves of migration.\n\nEven prior to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Belarus was used as a staging area to send thousands of migrants across the Polish border, prompting Warsaw to build a 200km fence with 300 cameras.\n\nSince the full-scale Ukraine invasion, Russia has also launched dozens of drone incursions and firebomb attacks on European airports, as well as a string of sabotage attacks on factories and railways supplying aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to punish the West over its military support for Ukraine and try to turn the public against Volodymyr Zelensky’s government in Kyiv.\n\nAs a wider part of that strategy, Belarus has been sending waves of balloons carrying contraband into neighbouring Nato countries to create air traffic chaos and probe for air defence weaknesses.\n\nThe tactic initially targeted Lithuania, but Polish officials say Belarusian balloons – usually loaded with bootleg cigarettes – are increasingly being sent in their direction.\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with the tunnels, Poland says it is more than capable of tracking down the entrances and blowing them up.\n\nBut there are concerns that, each time Warsaw closes off one access point to Europe for migrants, another one springs up elsewhere.\n\nOne minister has even suggested that the appearance of Middle Eastern-designed tunnels under Poland is a sign that their border force is too good at its job.\n\n“Digging these tunnels means that our effectiveness in stopping migration is so high that it was decided to bring in specialists from the Middle East to dig them,” said Czesław Mroczek, the deputy interior minister, in a recent interview on Polish radio.",

    "fullText": "Feb 24 (Reuters) - A federal judge in California on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit from Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI that accused rival Sam Altman's OpenAI ‌of stealing its trade secrets.\n\nU.S. District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco ‌said that xAI could refile its case, but for now has failed to allege that OpenAI committed any ​misconduct.\n\nWhat damages is Musk seeking in related litigation?\n\nWhat broader legal battle exists between Musk and OpenAI?\n\nWhy did the judge dismiss xAI's lawsuit against OpenAI?\n\nWhat trade secrets did xAI claim were stolen?\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in September, claimed that former xAI employees took source code related to its Grok chatbot and other confidential information with them when they left for new jobs at OpenAI.\n\n\"Notably absent are allegations about the conduct of OpenAI itself,\" Lin said. \"xAI does not allege ‌any facts indicating that OpenAI ⁠induced xAI’s former employees to steal xAI’s trade secrets or that these former xAI employees used any stolen trade secrets once employed ⁠by OpenAI.\"\n\nLin had signaled in a January opinion that she would likely rule for OpenAI. She gave xAI until March 17 to file an amended complaint.\n\nxAI has separately sued a former engineer, ​Xuechen Li, ​for allegedly taking trade secrets to the ChatGPT ​maker. Li was blocked in that ‌case from sharing xAI's technology with OpenAI, though OpenAI has said that Li never worked for the company and that it never acquired or used any of xAI's secrets.\n\nSpokespeople and attorneys for xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Tuesday decision.\n\n\"We welcome the court's decision,\" OpenAI said in a statement. \"This baseless lawsuit was ‌never anything more than yet another front in ​Mr. Musk's ongoing campaign of harassment.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is part ​of a broader legal battle between ​Musk and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which he co-founded and is also suing ‌over its conversion to a for-profit company.\n\nMusk, ​the world's richest ‍person, is ​seeking as much as $134.5 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft in that case. Jury selection is scheduled for April 27.\n\nOpenAI said in a court filing that ​the trade-secrets case was part ‌of a \"campaign to harass a competitor with unfounded legal claims\" because Grok ​could not keep up with ChatGPT.",

    "title": "6 Things to Do When You Wake Up If You Have Chronic Inflammation, According to Dietitians",
    "description": "Manage your inflammation and set a positive tone for your day with these simple morning habits.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN, RYT\n\nInflammation can wreak havoc on the body, and tweaking your morning routine may help.\n\nPractice mindfulness, spend time in nature and get some morning movement to lower stress.\n\nEat a nutrient-packed, reduced sugar breakfast and hydrate to help lower inflammation.\n\nInflammation is a popular buzzword that isn’t always well-understood. At its most basic level, inflammation is your body’s way of protecting itself from injuries and things that can make you sick, like viruses. “Acute inflammation, which is short-term, is a protective response to injury or infection,” says Amy Shapiro, MS, RD, CDN. “This type of inflammation lasts a few days to weeks and is a desired response in a healthy body,” explains Lauren Twigge, MCN, RDN, LD.\n\nInflammation goes from helpful to harmful when it becomes chronic. Over time, being in a constant inflammatory state can start to damage healthy cells and increase your risk for certain diseases, including autoimmune diseases, type 2 diabetes, dementia, obesity, cancer, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, heart disease and more. This type of inflammation is systemic, or system-wide, and is “seemingly present every day in our body, lasting months, years or longer if not addressed,” says Twigge.\n\nCommon symptoms of chronic inflammation include fatigue, joint or muscle pain, long-lasting digestive issues, brain fog or difficulty concentrating, skin problems (like eczema or acne) and frequent infections. The best way to know if you have chronic inflammation is by making an appointment with a health care professional. Whether you’ve been formally diagnosed with chronic inflammation or simply want to be proactive, there are several easy things you can do in the morning—and throughout the day—to help manage your symptoms and reduce inflammation.\n\nStarting your day with a mindfulness routine is a great way to relax your body and lower stress levels. “Chronic stress keeps inflammation levels high, so practices like mindfulness, deep breathing and relaxation techniques can significantly reduce it,” says Tricia McCoy, MS, RD, LDN. Luckily, there are many ways to incorporate mindfulness, including journaling, meditating, stretching, setting an intention for your day, praying or reading.\n\nHigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is an inflammatory marker that can help identify if you’re at risk for certain diseases, like heart disease. If you have elevated hs-CRP levels, several lifestyle changes can help, including following a high-fiber diet. Eating a diet rich in high-fiber foods, like vegetables, legumes and whole grains, can help improve insulin sensitivity and help lower inflammation.\n\nCertain types of fats can also be helpful. Nuts, seeds and fatty fish are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids—healthy fats that have been shown to help reduce inflammation and support overall health.\n\n“A nutrient-dense diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and fiber supports the body’s ability to naturally manage inflammation,” says McCoy. Luckily, there are many ways to incorporate sources of fiber and omega-3 fats at breakfast. Try adding chia seeds to your morning oats or blending this anti-inflammatory berry smoothie with hemp seeds.\n\nGetting up and out of your warm blankets isn’t always easy—especially in the cooler months. However, getting in the habit of moving your body in the morning has numerous benefits for your health. “Regular physical activity helps regulate immune function, improves circulation and supports overall metabolic health, all of which are essential for controlling inflammation and improving long-term health,” says McCoy. While exercising can cause temporary inflammation to help with muscle recovery and repair, staying active has been shown to help protect against chronic inflammation and reduce your risk of chronic disease.\n\nWhether you go for a walk, dance to music or do a 20-minute yoga flow, there are many ways to add movement to your morning. Start small, be consistent and build your way up to a goal that feels realistic. “Even 5 to 10 minutes helps improve circulation and stiffness,” says Shapiro.\n\nSunlight is nature’s vitamin D. Vitamin D plays a role in immune function, and adequate intake is important for regulating inflammation. “Early outdoor time with a dose of vitamin D can improve mood and reduce stress-induced inflammation,” says Shapiro.\n\nThe next time you pour yourself a cup of coffee, slide on a pair of slippers and take a few deep breaths outside. You can also try dipping your toes in the grass or venturing on a brisk morning walk with your four-legged friend. If it’s still dark when you wake up, find another time during the day to get a little sunshine. Walk to get lunch or sit outside during a break—even a few minutes can do your body good.\n\nAdequate hydration is vital for life. Even mild dehydration can negatively affect athletic and cognitive performance, digestion, skin health and inflammation. For an added health boost, Shapiro recommends starting your day with a glass of lemon or ginger water. Citrus fruits, like lemons, are high in vitamin C—a vitamin with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Similarly, ginger contains gingerol, a compound with anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nNot to be mistaken for natural sugars found in fruits and vegetables, added sugar is found in sweetened beverages, syrups, pastries and many breakfast cereals. While some added sugar can be part of a balanced diet, consuming excess amounts of added sugar has been linked with negative effects on gut health and insulin resistance, both of which can contribute to chronic inflammation and chronic disease risk.\n\nFoods high in added sugar also tend to be high in calories and can contribute to weight gain and excess body fat, which are associated with higher levels of inflammation.\n\nTo cut back on added sugars, take a look at what you typically eat—and drink—in the morning. If you regularly add two spoonfuls of sugar to your coffee, try adding just one. You can also try swapping out sweet breakfast items for savory recipes, like this Baby Kale Breakfast Salad that contains 6 grams of fiber and 9 grams of protein per serving.\n\nWhen it comes to managing chronic inflammation, the best way to start is by making small, realistic changes to your lifestyle. Practicing mindfulness, eating a nutritious breakfast, staying hydrated and getting outside are just a few simple ways you can adjust your morning routine to better support your wellness goals, reduce stress and lower inflammation.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nAs millions of working Americans race to save enough for retirement, you may wonder how you’re doing compared to the rest of the crowd.\n\nConsider Sam, who at 50 has $400K saved and was aiming for a clean $1 million in retirement. Now, she’s read that most Americans are reaching for $1.26M as their “magic number” for retiring comfortably, at least according to a 2025 study by Northwestern Mutual (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nMost Americans earn a dismal 0.39% APY on their cash at big banks. Unlock up to 4.05% APY and pay $0 in account fees instead with a Wealthfront Cash Account\n\nBeing behind her peers can be a frightening prospect at 50. What if she’s the only one left working well into her 60s?\n\nBut in truth, Sam is actually ahead of the curve, not behind it.\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, the average 401(k) balance among savers aged 50 to 54 was $199,900, according to Fidelity Investments (2). Averages, however, can be heavily affected by outliers. More recent data suggests that Gen Xers as a whole, which includes Sam, have a median 401(k) balance of $217,500 (3).\n\nThis means Sam and her $400K are pacing ahead of her peers, but she’s behind the $1.26M nest egg many Americans think they’ll need to retire.\n\nEven so, there’s still 12 years left before Social Security kicks in at the earliest. The real question is what Sam needs to do to get there with her money, and what you can do if you’re even further behind.\n\nOnce you have $400K in the bank, it can be easy to rest on your heels a bit, but it’s important to break down what it actually means for retirement.\n\nFinancial experts have long advocated using the 4% rule, which has you withdrawing 4% of your savings balance in your first year of retirement and then adjusting subsequent withdrawals for inflation (3). At its core, the rule is meant to ensure you have enough funds, coupled with Social Security, to last another 30 years after retiring.\n\nIf we apply this percentage, a $400,000 nest egg allows for $16,000 initially. That figure will then increase modestly year to year to account for inflation. Then, at 62, you can start taking Social Security.\n\nLet’s imagine you’re looking at $24,852 a year in Social Security benefits like the typical retired worker today (4), plus $16,000 a year from your savings for a total of $40,852. This is one of the reasons many retirees need to consider downsizing or lifestyle adjustments as they head into their golden years.",

    "description": "Nick Reiner is continuing his double murder case with a public defender, as reports indicate his siblings will not be funding his expenses.",
    "fullText": "Nick Reiner is continuing his double murder case with a public defender, as reports indicate his siblings will not be funding his legal expenses.\n\nThe elder brother of Romy and Jake, Nick, is accused of killing their parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, last December.\n\nThe 32-year-old has pleaded not guilty to the charges and waived his right to a speedy preliminary hearing. If found guilty, the prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty against Nick Reiner.\n\nIn December, Nick Reiner's life was turned upside down when he became the primary suspect in the tragic murder of his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner.\n\nInitially represented by high-profile attorney Alan Jackson, Reiner faced a major setback when Jackson unexpectedly withdrew from the case on January 7, the day scheduled for his arraignment.\n\nPublic defender Kimberly Greene was then assigned to represent the 32-year-old, and his hearing was rescheduled for February 23.\n\nThe prosecutor was then seen with Nick on the hearing day, which surprised some observers who had expected that Nick's siblings would hire another private attorney to defend their brother.\n\nUnfortunately for Nick, his public defender will remain on the case, as TMZ spoke with a source who confirmed that his siblings have no intention of hiring a private lawyer. They will also not be covering any legal bills that may arise during the course of his prosecution.\n\n\"Nick's defense is Nick's defense. They're not involved,\" a source told the news outlet after the hearing.\n\nDuring his February 23 hearing, Nick Reiner entered a plea to the charges against him.\n\nHe faces two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, meaning prosecutors could seek the death penalty if they pursue capital punishment.\n\nFor the charges, Nick entered a not guilty plea and waived his right to a speedy preliminary hearing. This meant the court was not required to schedule the hearing within ten court days or sixty calendar days.\n\nUltimately, the preliminary hearing was set for April 29, as requested by Greene. However, it is possible that more time may be sought, given the workload of the typical public defender.\n\nAfter the hearing, Nick was transported back to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, where he remains in custody during the ongoing prosecution.\n\nDespite having had weeks to reconsider, the prosecution still intends to seek the death penalty against Nick if he is found guilty.\n\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman confirmed his department's stance in a media statement following Nick's arraignment.\n\nHochman also noted that the case is proceeding on schedule, although the coroner's report is still pending.\n\nMeanwhile, speculation continues that Nick's defense team may structure his case around an insanity plea.\n\nEarlier reports had indicated that Nick was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was undergoing treatment for the condition.\n\nHowever, a new set of prescription medications reportedly caused erratic behavior in the days leading up to the murder of his parents.\n\nHe is also said to be aware that he is being accused of killing his parents, but believes he is in prison because of a conspiracy against him.\n\nUpon his arrival at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, Nick was placed on suicide watch, a standard precaution in high-profile cases.\n\nHe has since been removed from suicide watch and is now eligible for visits, although no family members have come forward.\n\nSources who spoke to Rob Shuter's #ShuterScoop reported that the Reiners are keeping their distance as they are still struggling to process the allegations against him.\n\n\"This isn't a misunderstanding or a minor scandal,\" an insider told the outlet. \"He killed their parents. That changes everything.\"\n\n\"They're mourning their parents while also trying to comprehend what he's done. You don't just walk into a visiting room after that,\" another insider remarked,\n\nSome, allegedly, also feel it is too soon to pay him a visit, given the gravity of the accusations.\n\n\"It's too soon — and for some of them, it may always be too soon,\" said one insider.",

    "description": "New developments in drone technology have led to increased capabilities on land, air, sea — including a new prototype that mimics a marine animal.",
    "fullText": "While most people think of aircraft like the fast-moving MQ-1 Predator when they hear the words \"military drone,\" that's not the only option. These days, drones can fly, as well as swim or travel overland; throughout the 21st century, they've proven their worth in the battlespace. The United States employed them throughout the War on Terror, and both sides of the Russo-Ukraine War have followed suit, though innovations in all areas of drone technology have increased the lethality of these devices in surprising ways.\n\nMarine drones in particular are becoming more important throughout the world, and Ukraine has already demonstrated their value in taking out large, strategic, and tactical targets. In February 2026, Lockheed Martin revealed its latest marine drone, Lamprey, a multi-mission autonomous undersea vehicle (MMAUV) capable of all manner of missions, but it's not the only drone of its kind. The Cardona Marine Group, Inc. (CMG), a defense tech startup, has been developing a similar technology for the past 15 years, and it's now in the functioning prototype sea trial stage.\n\nThe Sea-Predator-7 (SP-7) is an uncrewed surface vehicle (USV) that features a unique design. At a glance, it looks a bit like an Orca, but with the potential to be far deadlier; its payload capacity allows for the use of a variety of lethal armaments delivered stealthily to target enemy ships. Additional components and sensors allow for remote and potentially autonomous operation in the future, while the SP-7's components can be quickly fabricated for rapid production should the Department of War select them in a future defense acquisition contract.\n\nThe Sea-Predator 7 is designed with custom Kevlar, carbon fiber, ceramics, and ballistic fiberglass in its composition. It features a proprietary ballistic riblet coating and structure designed to mimic a shark's skin, combining with its design to enhance stealth and speed while also reducing power consumption during movement. These drones can be deployed in several ways, including dropping them from Navy MH-60R Romeo helicopters or Navy MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, miles from a target ship, either independently or within drone swarms.\n\nThe SP-7 can carry more than 800 lbs. of explosives for one-way attack capabilities alongside two specialized torpedoes. Additional armament options for the SP-7 include two CMG Mk 6 stealth riblet coated drone torpedoes, four CMG Mk 4 high-explosive torpedoes, a Mk 19 automatic 40 mm grenade launcher, twin M240B 7.62 mm machine guns, or six 40 mm smoke grenade launchers. It can be outfitted with four mini aerial drones used for reconnaissance. Additionally, the SP-7 itself can function as a remotely-operated underwater vehicle (ROV) ship mine, slamming into a target's hull and detonating.\n\nThe USV measures 13 feet long with a 5-foot beam, and is 3 feet high. Its weight is 700 lbs. before payloads are added. It moves through the water via a custom electric CMG flume drive for surface and sub-surface operations with electric bow planes and pulse thrusters for maneuvering. When you put it all together, the potential uses for SP-7s are widespread with the potential for changing marine offensive warfare.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "The public opinion regarding Donald Trump’s State of the Union address has finally come to light, with a poll revealing how the President’s speech fared in front of his audience. His addresses to Congress largely fetched favorable remarks from speech-watchers, arguably due to the spectators’ pool having 13 percentage points more Republican viewers than normal. However, despite having a more friendly audience, Trump’s speech drew its fair share of criticism, especially regarding his take on the cost of living.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 24, the two-time US President gave the second State of the Union address of his political career, ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nA CNN poll conducted by SSRS during the event divulged that approximately two-thirds of the audience present gave a somewhat favorable reaction to Donald Trump’s speech, with 38% giving it an extremely positive rating. This response is actually better than the points he scored during his address to Congress last year, but pales in comparison to the ratings of his first-term speeches.\n\nBefore Trump’s address, an estimated 54% of speech-watchers agreed that his policies would benefit the nation. After his speech, the CNN poll revealed that the percentage had risen to 64%. Similarly, a healthy 44% believed that the businessman-turned-politician was focusing on the right issues before the address, with the number jumping to 54% afterwards.\n\nHowever, a whopping 45% of the Republican-dominated audience admitted that Trump was giving too little attention to the cost of living after hearing what he had to say. Moreover, 40% relayed that they had no confidence that the President would make things more affordable.\n\nAdditionally, according to the poll, listeners were evenly split on Donald Trump’s actions regarding tariffs. His economic and immigration policies garnered a much better response, with 62% agreeing that his strategies are in line with the nation’s best interest.\n\nMeanwhile, 45% expressed full faith in Trump’s leadership, with 43% backing the 79-year-old politician for using US military power responsibly. As for his stance on Iran, 38% noted that he would be able to deal with the situation appropriately.\n\nDespite the overall positive response in the poll, Donald Trump’s State of the Union address should do little to sway public opinion in his favor, given that the speech-watchers mostly consisted of people who already resonate with his ideologies.\n\nNotably, in another CNN poll conducted a few days before Trump’s speech, his approval rating stood at a meager 36%.\n\nThe post Donald Trump’s Poll After State of the Union Revealed appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "title": "You May Want To Steer Clear Of These Cars Consumer Reports Says Are Unreliable",
    "description": "While lots of different factors can play a role in your decision to buy a car, how reliable it is should probably be near the top of your priorities list.",
    "fullText": "Lots of factors can help you whittle down the near-endless options for your budget when buying a car: mileage (if you're buying used), gas mileage, the level of tech on the dashboard, and the level of comfort for you and your passengers, to name a few. While all these determinants go a long way to informing your choice between multiple options, one other should probably have the biggest say in your decision: reliability.\n\nNobody wants to buy a nice car that requires multiple visits to the mechanic to stay on the road. Sure, maintenance is an important part of owning a car, but you want to be able to drive from point A to point B without wondering what new issues your ride is going to run into. Ideally, if you follow all the right maintenance procedures, you want your car to perform just as reliably five years down the road as the day you drove it off the dealership lot — while spending as minimally as possible on upkeep. To this end, SlashGear has a list of car brands that cost the least to maintain.\n\nSince reliability is front and center of consumer decision-making, Consumer Reports has come up with a list of the 10 least reliable cars in 2026. You'd probably do well to steer clear of these options, and we'll drill down into why with each one.\n\nThe GMC Acadia's struggles with reliability aren't a new phenomenon; issues have followed the model since it first launched in 2008. We even have a list of Acadia model years you might want to avoid. Its issues aren't exactly run-of-the-mill and easily withstood either. For the 2008 model, transmission problems were the headliner; they gave out randomly. Ideally, you'd expect to get at least 100,000 miles of run from your car before coming across any significant transmission problems. With the 2008 Acadia, however, these issues popped up well before that mark.\n\nThe transmission improved for the second generation, but other mechanical problems like water leakages and faulty thermostats reared their heads in the 2013 model. And then the reimagined 2018 model brought back the Acadia's transmission issues. Its timing when shifting could both bump and sag, and throw off drivers' rhythms. With enough time, it could even damage the transmission shifter.\n\nThe pains don't seem to have an end in sight either. The 2024 facelift was supposed to bring wholesale upgrades, from a better-powered engine to a comfy interior. That hasn't translated to good performance, unfortunately; build quality is still a question mark, fuel economy is poor for a midsize crossover (20 mpg combined versus a 24-26 range for the best-in-class), and mechanical issues stemming from the engine, radiator, and transmission still pop up, no matter the mileage.\n\nRivian is one of the leading brands of the EV boom, and its R1T model has the distinction of being the first mass-produced electric truck sold in the United States. However, Rivian is having a tough time converting that hype into real service; in its four years of production, it has already developed an unwanted reputation for being unreliable.\n\nThe pilot 2022 model has endured 11 recalls of varying degrees of seriousness. Over 12,000 units were recalled in early 2023 over concerns with the front seat belt system, which could cause the airbag to deploy improperly (or worse, not at all). Seat belts caused hundreds of units to be recalled on three separate occasions as well. These are the last thing a car owner wants to have to worry about, and the incessant nature is off-putting.\n\nThere are also issues with the battery, climate system, and other electrical systems to consider. The battery may be rated at 12V and advertised to travel 420 miles on a full charge, but it's prone to failure and falls short of that range considerably (270-300 miles) in real-world testing; some owners report the battery failing multiple times despite high charge levels. Question marks also remain over build quality (lots of misaligned trim pieces and panel gaps that give rise to increased wind noise and rattles) and HVAC systems that can sputter at any time.\n\nAnother electric vehicle on the list is the Chevrolet Blazer, which shouldn't surprise anyone — problems have run amok in the trim since the 2024 model. For the 2024 model, in fact, the issues got so bad that Chevrolet had to issue a temporary stop-sale. According to Edmunds, the company's unit showed up to 23 fault codes upon proper diagnostics after driving it around for less than 2,000 miles during a long term road test.\n\nThings didn't get much better in the 2025 rollout either. Some drivers reported not being able to shift out of park — a complaint that led to over 40,000 Chevrolet Blazer EVs being recalled by General Motors. 2025 models account for about a quarter of that figure, which indicates a problem of recurrence that drivers don't want to have to deal with. Couple that with the Chevy Blazer EV having a tendency to unexpectedly go \"turtle mode\" on drivers and the HVAC system being iffy at best (owners have reported it not being able to produce heat), and you have a car that fits the bill of unreliability.\n\nThere's also the chatter of touchy charging to consider; the Blazer EV can either stop charging altogether or witness a huge drop off in charge rate over time that makes juicing the car a tedious affair. Edmunds also reported a steady deterioration in charging performance of the 2024 Blazer EV, and the issue was severe enough to warrant a trip back to the dealership.\n\nHaving a system that depends on harmony between two sources of power without a regular driver feeling a hitch in transmission can be difficult for even the most decorated of automakers, and it's in this area that the hybrid Mazda CX-90 struggles. Its blend of gas and electric is clunky at best — there are noticeable hiccups and jerks in motion, especially at slow speeds or when coming to a full stop. When the CX-90 PHEV runs on gas, the transmission doesn't have too many problems. The electric mode is where the shifting awkwardness starts to rear its head.\n\nMotorTrend reports a \"hard and abrupt\" shift on occasion in this mode, which is quite unlike regular EVs, but manageable. In terms of fuel efficiency, it falls behind other models in its class — there's no real difference in economy between the PHEV and the regular gas-only CX-90 when running on gas. For other reliability metrics, such as recalls, serious mechanical problems, and the like, the Mazda CX-90 plug-in hybrid has a record that can raise a few eyebrows.\n\nSoftware issues of all kinds have led to widespread inconveniences; faulty dashboard electronics were serious enough to warrant the recalls of over 100,000 units, nearly 90,000 of which were 2024 and 2025 CX-90s. More serious threats, like a loss of drive power, were also discovered. Transmission smoothness, fuel efficiency, and software are the trio of problem areas for the CX-90 PHEV in an otherwise okay ride.\n\nThe sister brand of Hyundai and Kia, Genesis came onto the scene in May 2022 with its GV60 EV model. As one would expect coming from a manufacturer of such relative infancy, much like the Rivian R1T, the GV60 has its share of issues that have the potential to irk drivers.\n\nCharging may be the most annoying part of the GV60 experience, especially if you're considering getting the pilot 2022 version. After a relatively low number of miles in the driver's seat, owners reported malfunctions with the integrated charging control unit (ICCU) that affected the recharge process of the 12V battery. Over 1,700 units were recalled to fix the issue by updating the software or replacing the ICCU entirely. However, some recalls either didn't solve the problem at all or ended up manifesting in other areas, like the horn.\n\nAnother red flag for drivers is the range — both in terms of raw numbers and its uniformity across different weather conditions. The Genesis GV60 only posts 235 miles in its 2023 model as its estimated range, a figure that pales in comparison to other EVs in its class. This relative brevity is made worse by the variable nature of the statistic. You can get the advertised range out of the battery in an ideal climate, but in colder temperatures (and depending on your speed), the range can dip as low as 160 miles.\n\nThe hybrid version of this model featured earlier in the list, and according to Consumer Reports, the regular, fully gas-powered edition is not exempt from the reliability problems its cousin faces. The reality is somewhat different — chances are, if you can overlook certain annoyances, you wouldn't find the CX-90 unreliable at all.\n\nHowever, that's not to say that all of the problems the CX-90 faces are trivial. For instance, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently called for an investigation into a \"sticky steering\" issue apparently plaguing CX-90 units. 26 such reports were filed with the agency, and to make matters worse, all reports had undergone a previous recall (which had affected north of 40,000 units) to fix the worm gear in the steering system. Failed recalls don't exactly inspire confidence, so there's some credit to Consumer Reports' rating.\n\nSimilarly, if you place a lot of emphasis on the infotainment system, you're going to be somewhat disappointed with the CX-90; the connection you'll experience is tenuous at best, and at worst, it doesn't connect at all. Build and ride quality are fine for the most part, but it's been found that the driver's side mirror shakes at high speeds. We'd argue that a lot of these problems certainly cramp the experience of comfort you'd expect, but a fair share of them aren't necessarily reliability issues. Before you make a decision, you should check out our list of 13 things to know about the Mazda CX-90.\n\nYet another electric vehicle on the list, the Kia EV9 has some faults that should probably give a prospective buyer cause for concern. Many of the problems stem from software, which wouldn't necessarily be as big a factor with a gas-powered car, but are simply too critical to gloss over here.\n\nOn paper, there's loads to write home about with the EV9. There's plenty of cargo space. The 2024 version covers a 280-mile range according to EPA estimates. The build quality somehow reduces the relative incredulity of shelling out around $70,000 on a Kia (if you're acquiring the absolute top of the line). However, under the hood, there's one issue that stands out — the dashboard has had issues with its display. You might be thinking of the infotainment system when we say this, but no, the actual cluster of digital instruments that tell you how fast you're going, initiate your turn signals, and whatnot.\n\nA quick look at MotorTrend and chatter on online forums shows that multiple drivers have run into this problem, and the prospect of being prone to flying blind for even a few minutes is rightfully terrifying. Given that the fix isn't even instantaneous — you'd need to turn your car off and leave it locked for 20 minutes — you'd be justified to be a little hesitant about pulling the trigger on this purchase. Kia did send out a recall to solve the problem, but experiences with Kia dealerships have apparently been less than stellar.\n\nThe Kia EV6 is more of a wagon, while the EV9 is a conventional three-row SUV. However, when it comes to software glitches, they might as well be two peas in a pod.\n\nThe EV6 manifested a problem with the ICCU, which is something that a lot of EVs struggle with these days. In the EV6's case, the unit is particularly prone to damage, and the problem shows up in two ways. The first is what you'd expect: the 12V battery eventually stops charging, but the second is far more dangerous; the EV6 suddenly loses motive power.\n\nThere have been cases of units manufactured between 2022 and 2024 \"dying\" while actively driving — a phenomenon that can cause traffic pileups, or worse, an accident. These occurrences were grievous enough for the NHTSA to open an investigation into the EV6. Kia recalled over 4,000 units to fix the issue back in 2024, but judging from more recent driver experiences posted on Reddit, it's clear that didn't sort out all the problems. That's quite disappointing, considering SlashGear rated the EV6 quite highly in our 2022 review.\n\nWhen you shell out around $50,000 on a car, you don't expect to run into incessant problems. That's especially true when you have a car that's essentially the brainchild of two giants in the automotive industry. GM may not have the most pristine reputation in the reliability department, but Honda certainly does. At least, that's what history suggests if you take the Honda Passport as a case study.\n\nWhy then is the Prologue so different? A short answer is that the mechanics are, to put it kindly, very flawed. Scheduled charging fails regularly, which can leave you in a tight spot if you've meticulously planned out your routine and timing only to find out your car wasn't charging all along. Secondly, the suspension and handling are both suspect you'll likely hear all sorts of noises when you drive over any bump on the road, and it's not like it makes up for it in the way it rolls around corners.\n\nCouple these experiences with incidents of random braking, especially when your car's in reverse. If you don't switch the assist system to alert-only, chances are you'll encounter the Prologue slamming the brakes when you're backing out of your garage for benign reasons — and there have been some cases of the assist randomly doing so while in normal forward motion too.\n\nThe last entry on Consumer Reports' list is the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, and there are quite a few supporting reasons that lend credence to its placement. First things first, no driver wants to deal with the uncertainty that comes with not being able to predict their own engine's next move. You want to drive safely from point A to point B, all things being equal, with no issues. That's not the reality of Pacifica Hybrid owners at all, unfortunately.\n\nIf you're considering getting a Pacifica Hybrid manufactured between 2017 and 2023, you might want to think again. In fact, SlashGear has an in-depth analysis of specific model years of the Pacifica Hybrid to avoid. In 2023, Stellantis recalled 76,000 units of the model worldwide over an issue with the transmission wiring connector — an issue that could cause engines to unexpectedly shut down. Stellantis downplayed the frequency, stating that only 0.2% of cars were affected, but lemon law considerations on social media platforms tell a different story. There are multiple reports of Pacifica Hybrids going into limp mode or just completely shutting off and subsequently having to spend weeks out of commission.\n\nTransmission issues and engine stalling aren't the only factors to consider; AC systems have problems maintaining cold temperatures, and there's also a history of battery issues. In fact, Stellantis had to recall over 19,500 units due to an abnormality in the battery cells that could lead to a fire outbreak.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "How important is magnesium for brain health? According to one study, higher magnesium lowers dementia risk. Here's what the scientists found.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nEating more magnesium-rich foods may improve cognitive function and lower dementia risk, according to one study.\n\nResearchers say that magnesium reduces brain inflammation and may benefit post-menopausal women the most.\n\nExperts share how to safely increase your daily magnesium intake.\n\nLongevity is one of the hottest research areas in the health world right now. But doctors and scientists are not just trying to figure out how to help people live longer—instead, they're looking for ways to help you live longer in a healthy way, keeping your body strong and mobile and your mind sharp for as long as possible. One study contributing to this new body of research found that higher magnesium lowers dementia risk, while others are increasing our understanding of the role of magnesium in maintaining optimal brain health.\n\nHere, find out what the research says about magnesium and brain health, plus how to get enough of the mineral from your daily diet.\n\nMeet the experts: Khawlah Alateeq, Ph.D. researcher from the ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health; Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and member of the Prevention Medical Review Board; Amit Sachdev, M.D., director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at Michigan State University.\n\nThe study, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, utilized data from the UK Biobank and analyzed more than 6,000 cognitively healthy participants in the United Kingdom aged 40 to 73. Dietary magnesium was measured using a 24-hour recall questionnaire to estimate the daily amount people ingested and recorded five times over 16 months.\n\nResearchers found that people who consumed more than 550 milligrams (mg) of magnesium each day had a brain age that was approximately one year younger by the time they reached 55, compared to someone with a normal magnesium intake of about 350 mg a day. “Our study shows a 41% increase in magnesium intake could lead to less age-related brain shrinkage, which is associated with better cognitive function and lower risk or delayed onset of dementia in later life,” lead author and Ph.D. researcher Khawlah Alateeq, from the ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, said in a press release.\n\nThe study also showed that higher dietary magnesium intake may contribute to protecting the brain earlier in the aging process and preventative effects may begin in your 40s or even earlier, Alateeq said in the press release. “This means people of all ages should be paying closer attention to their magnesium intake.” In addition to these findings, researchers also found that the brain-protective effects of more dietary magnesium appeared to benefit women more than men, and more so in post-menopausal than pre-menopausal women.\n\nWhile this study came out in 2023, research that has been published since continues to illuminate the role of magnesium in maintaining brain health and staving off dementia. A study in the Journal of Neurorestoratology found that magnesium may block key receptors in the brain to halt the course of Alzheimer's disease, plus reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which contribute to the development of age-related chronic diseases like dementia.\n\nMagnesium is a mineral commonly found in nuts, seeds, leafy greens, and dairy, said Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and member of the Prevention Medical Review Board. “Magnesium is necessary for the maintenance of our body tissues, including nerve signaling in the brain and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier.”\n\nIn addition to the findings of the above studies, magnesium deficiency has been associated with an increase in brain inflammation and with the development of diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease, explained Mroz-Planells.\n\nAdditionally, there is a relationship between magnesium status, intake, and menopause that may account for some differences between men and women, said Mroz-Planells. “High intake of magnesium in post-menopausal women has been associated with lower levels of inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, [a protein that indicates the level of inflammation in your body],” she explained.\n\nAdult magnesium needs vary by age and biological sex from 310-420 mg per day, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The aforementioned study found the most brain health benefits in people who consumed 550 mg per day from food—according to the NIH, getting more than the recommended magnesium intake from food is not dangerous because the kidneys will eliminate any excess. However, there are some possible side effects from supplementing with high doses of magnesium, including diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping. For this reason, always check with your doctor or a registered dietitian before adding a magnesium supplement or going over the recommended daily intake.\n\nFirst and foremost, try to increase your intake of magnesium-rich foods. According to Mroz-Planells, a sample day could include “cereal, milk, and a banana for breakfast, a sandwich on whole wheat bread with 1 cup of bean soup for lunch, 1 ounce of almonds for a snack, and a dinner of salmon, brown rice, and broccoli, providing around 350 mg of magnesium in total for the day.”\n\nIncluding magnesium-rich foods like whole grains and dark-green, leafy vegetables in your diet are beneficial for brain health no matter your age, said Mroz-Planells. “Eating a healthful diet has a positive impact on your brain health by reducing [brain] inflammation and providing the right nutrients for your brain’s optimal performance.”\n\nHealthy living leads to a healthy brain, affirmed Amit Sachdev, M.D., director of the Division of Neuromuscular Medicine at Michigan State University. While trying to consume enough magnesium is smart, “more common aspects of health, such as blood sugar and alcohol intake, are much more associated with brain health than magnesium,” he said. Making choices in the kitchen and in your daily life that will nourish your body is the best way to protect your brain as you age.\n\nDietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

Anyone who mentioned a goat in his presence (in reference to how hairy he was) because of this joke was rumored to get a death sentence.\n\nIn 41 AD, four months after his return from Gaul, Caligula was murdered by Cassius Chaerea, Cornelius Sabinus, and others. His wife, Caesonia, and his daughter were also executed.\n\nHe made a vast fortune from ivory and made numerous possessions out of it. When rubber became the next significant raw material—with inventions of the inflatable bicycle and automobiles on the rise—Leopold exploited the wild rubber reserves that grew in the Central African rainforests. His private army would enter a village, hold the women hostage, and force the men to gather a monthly quota of wild rubber.\n\nFrom road building to chopping wood, the natives were forced to work. Many of the women hostages starved, and the men were worked to the point of death. Due to this, thousands of Congolese fled their villages to avoid being forced laborers and found refuge in the forest, where food and shelter were scarce.\n\nThis meant that Christian missionaries were expelled, worship was banned, and converts were persecuted. European technology and customs were strictly restricted, and trade was heavily controlled.\n\nThese measures were her form of resistance against the dangers of foreign powers and colonization; however, they also came at a steep internal cost.\n\nHis third wife, Jane Seymour, produced a son, which Henry VIII much desired; however, she tragically died during childbirth.\n\nQueen Catherine Howard was 17 when she married the 49-year-old king, days after he had obtained an annulment from Anne of Cleves. When the king found out that she had had sexual relations at 15 with an older man, named Francis Dereham, it was seen as treason. Under the 'bill of attainder,' Catherine was sentenced to death with no trial. His last wife, Catherine Parr, outlived Henry.\n\nHistorian John Stow claimed that Henry VIII had around 70,000 people executed (although this is believed to be an exaggerated number), but it was near the thousands, including the execution of 67-year-old Margaret Pole, who was once his daughter governess. His reign is one of the bloodiest and messiest in history.\n\nPerhaps the worst use of this starvation technique was on King John's former friend, William De Briouze's family—his wife Matilda and his son, William. In 1210, he imprisoned the mother and son in his castle and starved them to death.\n\nNegotiations between John and his barons failed, and a civil war broke out in 1215. John was again called to negotiate with the rebels, and finally, in June 1215, he accepted the baronial terms. After further revisions were made to the document, the king signed the famous Magna Carta, which ensured feudal rights and restated English law.\n\nHis reputation and reign were further degraded. He was known as a suspicious, vengeful, and treacherous king.\n\nFollowing this, Sforza of Milan conspired to overthrow the Spanish rule, along with Pope Clement VII's support, by bribing the marquis of Pescara—but this failed when Pescara exposed it to Charles. Meanwhile, Francis I was released from captivity after renouncing claims to Burgundy and Italy, then joined Clement in forming the League of Cognac (1526) against Spain—an alliance too weak to succeed since Francis did not have the money to support the military.\n\nAlso in Rewind: Answer These '80s, '90s, And 2000s Trivia Questions And We'll Guess Your Exact (And I Mean EXACT) Age\n\nAlso in Rewind: People Are Sharing The Weirdest, Eeriest, Most Fascinating Historical Events That 100% Read Like A Time Traveler Altered History\n\nAlso in Rewind: 24 Absolutely Bizarre Historical Events I Can Hardly Believe Actually Took Place",

    "fullText": "STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of killing a 70-year-old grocery store owner was put to death Tuesday in Florida, becoming the second person executed by the state this year after a record 19 executions in 2025.\n\nMelvin Trotter, 65, was pronounced dead at 6:15 p.m. following a three-drug injection at Florida State Prison near Starke for the 1986 stabbing death of Virgie Langford.\n\nThe curtain to the execution chamber went up at the scheduled 6 p.m. execution time. Trotter declined to give a last statement and the drugs began flowing about two minutes later. Trotter began to breath heavily and twitch about a minute afterward. Then his movements slowed about two minutes later.\n\nThe prison warden checked Trotter's face and shouted his name, but there was no reaction. A medic was then called in at 6:14 p.m. to check the inmate's vital signs and Trotter was declared dead a minute later.\n\nThe execution and another earlier this month in Florida follow the unprecedented 19 executions carried out by the state last year. In 2025, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis oversaw more executions in a single year than any other Florida governor since the death penalty's reinstatement in 1976. The previous Florida record was eight executions in 2014.\n\nAccording to court records, Trotter stabbed and strangled Langford on June 16, 1986, at her store in Palmetto near the southern edge of Tampa Bay. Afterward, a truck driver found Langford bleeding but alive on the back floor of the store, and she provided key details about her attacker before dying at a hospital.\n\nBesides recalling Trotter’s physical appearance, Langford said he had a Tropicana employee badge with the name “Melvin” on it. According to court records, police later found a T-shirt with Langford’s blood type at Trotter’s home and the man’s handprint on a meat cooler at the store.\n\nIn 1987, Trotter was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Then, after the state Supreme Court found the trial court erred in handling aggravating factors in his case, he again drew the death penalty at resentencing in 1993.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court recently denied appeals to block the execution. Trotter's attorneys argued officials had mismanaged his death penalty protocols. They also said Trotter's advanced age of 65 merited exempting him from execution.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court denied Trotter’s final appeal Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSeparately, Justice Sonia Sotomayor raised questions about the state’s administration of lethal drugs. Trotter’s attorneys argued that Florida could “maladminister” the state’s protocol in a way that heightens the risk for a “mangled” execution in violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nSotomayor wrote that, going forward, she hopes the state “will recognize the paramount importance of ensuring that it conducts executions consistently” with the proper protocols.\n\nA total of 47 people were executed in the U.S. in 2025. Florida led the way with a flurry of death warrants signed by DeSantis. Alabama, South Carolina and Texas tied for second with five executions each last year.\n\nBesides the two Florida executions this year, Texas and Oklahoma have conducted one execution each so far in 2026.\n\nOn Feb. 10, a man convicted of killing a traveling salesperson became the first person executed in Florida this year. Ronald Palmer Heath, 64, received a lethal injection for the 1989 killing of Michael Sheridan.\n\nTwo more Florida executions are scheduled next month starting with Billy Leon Kearse on March 3 and then Michael Lee King on March 17.\n\nAll Florida executions are carried out by injecting a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the Department of Corrections.\n\nHours before Tuesday's execution, Florida Corrections officials said, Trotter awoke at 3:20 a.m. and had one visitor during the day but did not meet with a spiritual adviser. He requested a meal that included fish, cornbread, cake and soda.",

    "fullText": "Researchers uncovered hundreds of previously unknown deep-sea species, giving the scientific community a better idea of what lives on the ocean floor.\n\nA recent study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution found 4,350 wildlife specimens on the seabed. Of those, about 3,826 could be identified from 788 known species, meaning over 500 specimens of potential new species were discovered.\n\nWith a more comprehensive catalog of the flora and fauna that live on the ocean floor, researchers can better understand how to preserve that ecosystem.\n\nThis study was conducted partly to collect data on the impacts of deep-sea metal mining on wildlife.\n\nThe scientists did their research 4,000 meters below the surface in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a stretch of sea between Hawaiʻi and Mexico. This area holds critical minerals such as nickel and cobalt used in green tech, including the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries.\n\n\"It is now important to try to predict the risk of biodiversity loss as a result of mining,\" Adrian Glover, senior author from the Natural History Museum of London, said in a news release.\n\n\"This requires us to investigate the biodiversity of the 30 percent of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone that has been protected. At present, we have virtually no idea what lives there,\" Glover added.\n\nWhen we have a better picture of what lies in the wake of our industrial projects, we can better address how to extract necessary materials from the environment more responsibly.\n\nIn some cases, this information can lead to the complete halt of harmful practices. This helps combat biodiversity loss, which has negatively impacted our food supplies, natural regulatory processes, and more.\n\nThe discovery of new species demonstrates what a healthy marine ecosystem can look like and what prevents these environments from thriving.\n\nResearchers have already observed a 37% decline in animal populations in the paths near mining operations in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates made a tiny move higher today. According to the Zillow lender marketplace, the 30-year fixed rate rose one basis point from its previous multi-year low to 5.77%. The 15-year fixed rate stepped up three basis points to 5.40%. The 15-year VA loan is an eye-opening 4.99%.\n\nMortgage lenders with the best rates this week: APRs as low as 5.49%.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined period, then adjust it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.77% right now, according to data compiled from the Zillow lender marketplace. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, mortgage rates vary by state, and if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nYes, mortgage rates are dropping for various reasons. The stock market has been suffering volatility, due to international concerns, including the on-again, off-again Trump tariffs. There has also been growing concern that the Federal Reserve will delay its next interest rate cut to June. When buyers turn to the bond market, yields fall as prices rise.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nWhy are mortgage rates dropping right now?\n\nWhat are today's current mortgage rates by loan type?\n\nWhat are the advantages of adjustable-rate mortgages?\n\nHow do 30-year and 15-year fixed mortgages compare?\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to.

    "fullText": "Elaine Ellery died from cancer related to asbestos she was exposed to as a child, a court was told on Feb. 16\n\nEllery was 67 when she died at a hospice in England in August 2025\n\nThroughout her childhood, she would hug her father in his work clothes and visited the factory where he worked\n\nA woman in England died from an aggressive form of cancer decades after she was exposed to asbestos.\n\nElaine Ellery died at Priscilla Bacon Lodge hospice on Aug. 6, 2025, at the age of 67, local media outlet the Eastern Daily Press reported. The mother of two, who lived in the county of Norfolk in East England, had no known contact with asbestos in her adult life.\n\nHowever, a hearing at Norfolk Coroner’s Court on Feb. 16 concluded that she died of “industrial disease of mesothelioma” caused by the dangerous fibers she was exposed to throughout her childhood, the court confirmed to PEOPLE.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, mesothelioma \"is a cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the mesothelium. The mesothelium is a thin layer of tissue that covers many internal organs.\"\n\n\"It most often happens in the tissue around the lungs,\" per the medical center. \"Mesothelioma also can happen in the tissues in the belly, around the heart and around the testicles.\"\n\n“When I attended junior school [elementary school] in those days, we came home at lunchtime,” said Ellery in a statement given before her death, per the Eastern Daily Press. “My father also came home from work at lunchtime and we all had a meal together.”\n\nEllery’s father worked at a factory from 1949 until he was made redundant in 1974, according to the outlet. He would still be wearing his work clothes when he returned to their Bedfordshire home during the day.\n\n“I did not pay much attention to his overalls, but I remember that he just wore his own clothes to work, which were suitable for laboring duties,” said Ellery, per the outlet. “I was very close to my dad and as soon as he came home, I would go up to him and hug him.\"\n\n“I was still very young and it was exciting when my father came home,” she added.\n\nThe clothing may have had asbestos fibers on it, which Ellery was then exposed to when she hugged him and when she helped her mother wash his clothes, per the court hearing.\n\nFrom the age of 8, she also began visiting the factory for its annual Christmas party.\n\n“I was always excited to go there because there was a substance which looked like snow on the ground,” she said, per the Eastern Daily Press. “It was not snow but had a similar appearance and in hindsight, I believe it must have been asbestos on the ground from the factory’s operations.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nHer father’s death in 1983 was ruled an industrial disease resulting from asbestos exposure, following his cancer diagnosis a year before. He was 59, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nBlue and brown asbestos were banned in the U.K. in 1985, while white asbestos remained in use until 1999. The dangerous material may still be present in any house or building built before 2000, according to the U.K. government website, GOV.UK.\n\nEllery was diagnosed with mesothelioma in October 2024 despite her work history showing no occupational exposure to asbestos. The mother of two retired as a personal assistant in April 2019.\n\n“She died from exposure to asbestos as a child,” said area coroner Johanna Thompson at the hearing, per the Eastern Daily Press.\n\nSpeaking to Ellery’s family, Thompson added, “I would like to offer my most sincere condolences. I am so sorry for your loss.”",

The Boston Market Wikipedia page says it currently has 22 stores left, but The Street said the actual number could be less than 20.\n\nThe outlet cited a report from Nation’s Restaurant News in 2023 that claimed that Boston Market owner Jay Pandya faced “hundreds of lawsuits from vendors, franchisors, and employees regarding unpaid bills” when he filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 8, 2023.\n\nAt the time, per the report, he cited $10-$50 million in liabilities.\n\nBut, The Street reported, that filing by Pandya and another attempt were each rejected by the courts.\n\nSo, what happened to Boston Market and its delicious rotisserie chickens to call such a fall off?\n\nRestaurant analyst Aaron Allen told FCNews that the chain hurt itself “by holding its costs down — a move that ultimately led to a reduction in quality, which only undercut it further.”\n\nAlso, a big issue for Boston Market, per The Street’s report, was the fact that grocery stores began offering rotisserie chickens.\n\n“The chain eventually saw the likes of Costco serve up the same things far cheaper,” retail and restaurant expert Steve Feldman reportedly said.\n\nAnd, because of that, it might be hard for Boston Market to pull itself back off life support.",

    "description": "In the age of AI, Big Four firms need the skills that junior consultants have, Errol Gardner, EY's global consulting lead, told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "AI anxiety is hitting entry-level workers hardest. For those aiming for a consulting career, where junior staff historically built slide decks and crunched data, AI agents seem like an intimidating new competitor.\n\nBut two of EY's top consulting leaders say junior employees are a valuable asset for professional services firms in the AI age.\n\nLack of experience is what makes the youngest professionals at EY valuable, Dan Diasio, EY's global consulting AI leader, told Business Insider.\n\nThey arrive without a decade or more of assumptions about how work should be done — more of a blank sheet of paper. That allows them to challenge the status quo and rethink processes from first principles.\n\nHis advice for junior consultants at EY is to use that to their advantage: be bold, ask questions about the way things are done, and lean into the use of technology.\n\n\"If anything, as a young graduate, they've got more opportunity to change our organization,\" Errol Gardner, global head of consulting at the Big Four firm EY, told Business Insider. Junior consultants have the native digital skills and the creativity necessary for the AI era, he said.\n\nAcross the industry, consulting firms are racing to embed generative AI into their own workflows while advising clients on how to implement the technology. That shift is prompting a reassessment of hiring, with a new focus on engineering talent.\n\nIt's also raised questions about the traditional consulting pyramid model, which has long relied on teams of junior staff to perform research and prepare materials. If AI agents can complete much of that \"assembly\" work in seconds, what happens to entry-level roles?\n\nFellow Big Four firm PwC has reduced graduate hiring goals in the US, in part because of \"the impact of AI,\" according to an internal presentation obtained by Business Insider last August.\n\nAt EY, Gardner said there has been \"no material change\" in graduate recruitment due to AI. The firm continues to hire to support growth in its consulting business, he said.\n\nIn its latest annual report, EY said it invests more than $1 billion annually in developing AI-first platforms and products, and AI-related revenue was up 30% in the firm's 2025 financial year.\n\nDiasio, who is responsible for AI across EY's consulting business, added that knowledge-workers broadly, not just the young ones, are getting a bad rap amid the current AI narrative.\n\nThere is an idea that they're going to be replaced by AI, said Diasio, but AI without context, knowledge, and expertise, puts you down a path of \"statistical sameness\" and produces, as he put it, \"polished slop.\"\n\nHe said we're in the early stages of an evolution of consultants' roles: \"Our people are going to move more to being creators, creators of new business models, creators of new opportunities for our clients, creators of maybe new products.\"\n\n\"It's people and their creativity that lift the ceiling,\" he added.\n\nWhile the tools consultants use are evolving rapidly, Gardner said the core objective of their job remains the same: delivering value to clients, developing clients' teams, working collaboratively to implement change, and pursuing learning and development.\n\nThat won't shift by 2030 — or even 2040, he argued. \"As long as human beings are buying from human beings, there will continue to be difficulty in executing change and implementing technology,\" he said.\n\nWhat will change is how the work gets done. Consultants will spend less time on what Gardner described as \"assembly\" work — pulling together presentations, drafting proposals, or synthesizing information — and more time interpreting insights and shaping outcomes.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Gucci's new AI-generated ads have hit a nerve online.\n\nThe renderings — including a glamorous woman in a fur coat striding through a restaurant, a pair of models some commentators likened to \"Grand Theft Auto\" characters, and sleek car scenes — were posted on Gucci's social media pages ahead of creative director Demna Gvasalia's first runway show at Milan Fashion Week on Friday.\n\nThe images quickly drew sharp criticism online, with some users calling them \"cheap\" and \"slop\"— a term used to describe AI-generated content perceived as low-quality or mass-produced.\n\n\"You did not need to use AI for this, so tacky,\" one Instagram user said. Another user wrote: \"Craftsmanship reduced to marketing narrative.\" One user on X said AI makes the brand look cheaper than TJ Maxx.\n\nA post shared by GUCCI (@gucci)\n\nNot all of the images for the \"Primavera\" campaign are AI-generated — it also includes a mix of other photography.\n\nGucci did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBranding experts say that while some consumers perceive the images as \"cheap,\" Gucci's decision to use AI was likely driven by creative intent rather than cost-cutting.\n\nIt's about \"positioning Gucci at the intersection of fashion, art and technology,\" Blanca Zugaza Escribano, a fashion and luxury strategy consultant at Metyis, told Business Insider.\n\nThe use of AI fits into Gucci's history of experimentation and boundary-pushing, she said.\n\n\"It signals creative futurism, reinforces the brand's relevance in a tech-driven world, and allows it to generate surreal, high-impact imagery that traditional production might not easily achieve,\" she added.\n\nPRIMAVERAFebruary 272 p.m. CETCreated with AI pic.twitter.com/sNbcFrpTX9\n\nThis isn't the first time the Italian luxury fashion house has dipped its toes into AI.\n\nEarlier this month, Gucci partnered with Snapchat for an AI interactive lens — a feature that enables Snapchat users to become one of Gucci's \"La Famiglia\" figures. These were fictional digital characters created for one of its collection rollouts.\n\nArmelle Poulou, CFO of Kering — Gucci's parent company — said in its fourth-quarter earnings call that the launch of the \"La Famiglia\" Collection, and its \"surrounding activations,\" are putting \"Gucci back at the center of the attention.\"\n\nThat push for visibility comes at a critical moment for the brand.\n\nGucci had the steepest revenue decline among Kering's portfolio, falling 22% on a reported basis and 19% on a comparable basis in its full-year 2025 earnings.\n\nMatthew Drinkwater, the director of the Fashion Innovation Agency at the London College of Fashion, said luxury has traditionally been rooted in \"craft, heritage and human storytelling.\"\n\n\"If AI is used in a way that feels like it replaces craft, it risks undermining the very thing that creates aspiration,\" he said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Gucci has been accused of diluting the brand image. While its push for maximalism and logos more than doubled its revenue between 2015 and 2022 —under creative director Alessandro Michele — when consumers turned to the \"quiet luxury\" trend, it was unable to keep up.\n\nAlongside mass-market partnerships, the fashion house's customer base had also become younger and more aspirational, many of whom seem to have moved on.\n\nGucci isn't the only brand to face backlash for its use of AI in marketing. In December, fashion house Valentino raised eyebrows after launching an AI-generated campaign for its DeVain handbag.\n\nA post shared by Valentino (@maisonvalentino)\n\n\"Ruining a fashion house legacy is tough work, but I see you guys have determination,\" one user on Instagram said of Valentino's campaign at the time.\n\nFor luxury brands, the challenge of delivering a positive tech experience is even greater, said Elaine Parr, a senior partner and consumer products and retail industries leader EMEA at IBM.\n\nNot only is it a \"tough market\" for luxury right now as a pullback in spending from aspirational shoppers weighs on sales, but \"you need to deliver on the Lux brand promise and be modern whilst retaining your heritage,\" Parr added.\n\nThe Instagram comments section of luxury brands has become \"the most honest focus group in fashion,\" said Drinkwater, the director of the Fashion Innovation Agency at the London College of Fashion.\n\n\"Almost any use of AI in fashion still seems to trigger a level of outrage,\" he added.\n\nDrinkwater said that while AI is more effective when it supports a creative vision rather than replaces it, negative campaign reactions \"are good examples of how quickly the conversation can turn when people feel craft or human input is being displaced.\"",

    "title": "After weeks of getting bashed, two software giants can make the case for why AI won't kill them",
    "description": "Software giants finally get to respond to the claims that they're going extinct.",
    "fullText": "After being marked for dead, software companies have a chance to tell their side of the story.\n\nExcluding Canada's Olympic hockey teams, no one has had a tougher go recently than software companies. Everyone faces some fear over AI, but software's diagnosis has been more dire than most. (Author Nassim Taleb was the latest to write software's eulogy, although he's not known for his optimism.)\n\nTwo software giants — Salesforce and Snowflake — get to make the case for why they're still very much alive. Both companies report earnings after the bell and will be interested in changing a narrative that's helped push their stocks down 27% (Salesforce) and 26% (Snowflake) this year.\n\n(Workday, another software company that's been getting hammered, made the case yesterday why AI is friend, not foe.)\n\nA major problem for software companies is that their opponent is largely hypothetical. Even if both companies report blockbuster earnings, there's still the counterargument that AI will eventually eat their lunch.\n\nAnthropic has played this game masterfully. The startup has strategically rolled out product announcements for its AI chatbot, Claude. The news has devastated entire industries despite there being no evidence of widespread adoption yet.\n\nHere's what to look out for from Salesforce and Snowflake when they report:\n\nSalesforce: Marc Benioff's company is the prototypical enterprise software company. Customer relationship management systems are all about workflow and rely heavily on seat-based subscriptions. That makes Salesforce a prime target for AI automation and a bellwether for other software companies.\n\nBenioff has sought to address competitors head-on with Salesforce's own AI agents and even contemplated a name change to acknowledge the shift. But Agentforce has had its share of challenges. An internal survey showed that most employees feel AI is increasing their productivity, but Salesforce will want the same positivity coming from outside its walls.\n\nThese days, AI might not even be Salesforce's biggest headache. An off-color joke from Benioff at a recent employee event has outraged many workers and even prompted fellow Salesforce executives to speak out.\n\nSnowflake: The data-warehousing giant might seem like a major beneficiary of AI. Models need tons of data to function. Snowflake helps companies organize and analyze massive amounts of data. Everybody wins!\n\nThe potential future isn't as rosy. Snowflake's business might not face the direct risk that other software companies struggle with, but it could slide down the totem pole of customers' tool set. Instead of being considered a crucial software, it could become just another piece of back-end infrastructure.\n\nSnowflake's own CEO warned of this future, saying models' desire to have easy access to all types of data means \"everything else, the world, is just a dumb data pipe that feeds into that big brain.\"\n\nAnd unfortunately for Snowflake, the value you provide to customers as a \"dumb data pipe\" is a lot lower, meaning you can't charge as much.",

    "description": "Valerie Valcourt worked in Big Tech for years, making six figures at Google. She left the tech industry behind to attend pastry school in France.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Valerie Valcourt, 36, who previously worked at Amazon and Google before she became a pastry chef. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I took a home economics class where we baked a lot. It was one of my favorite classes. One time, my teacher said, \"Val, you're running this for the day,\" and I was in charge of everything. That's when I knew I'd love to go to pastry school.\n\nI graduated from high school in 2007, and my parents said, \"You're not going to pastry school. You don't need to be in the kitchen.\"\n\nI worked at Big Tech companies for about five years, but as time passed, I realized I wasn't happy. That dream of wanting to go to pastry school had never disappeared.\n\nI was living in Seattle and making over $100,000 with equity and bonuses as an administrative business partner at Google. I lucked out finding good apartments in cool neighborhoods, and financially, I was OK, but I felt unfulfilled. I was in environments where it was very dog-eat-dog. I'd look around the room and think, \"What am I doing here?\"\n\nI kept asking myself why I wasn't doing something that brought me joy. I would still bake here and there, making cakes and cupcakes for friends, and found myself enjoying the process.\n\nI applied to a pastry school in Paris and got accepted, but the school's fees were high, and I realized I didn't actually have the funds.\n\nI also wasn't mentally prepared. I felt stuck in this frozen state, unable to make the moves I needed to. So I left Big Tech and moved to New York for a year. I became an executive assistant at a meditation company, and it was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had. It really affirmed my decision to go to pastry school.\n\nI knew that if I went to school in the US, I'd probably be taking on a lot of loans, so I began looking in France again.\n\nI found an accelerated three-month program called Gastronomicon in Agde, a small beach village in the south of France. It provided pastry lessons, French lessons, a four-month internship at a Michelin-level restaurant, and housing for both the school and internship. Everything was $10,000. Any other school I looked at lacked at least one of those things and still had a higher price tag.\n\nWhen I told my parents, they were so supportive. My sister, friends, and everyone rallied around me, which was so helpful during those moments when I had doubts about starting over. I was 33 at the time. I thought, \"OK, I can do this and see where this takes me. I don't know what's going to happen after school, but I'm going to do my best.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy to assimilate right away. I had three hours of French class and three hours of pastry every Monday through Friday.\n\nMy school was scheduled so that each week was a theme, like bread, chocolate, plated desserts, or entremets. I had no idea there were so many desserts in France, so everything was completely brand-new — from the meringues to the pâte à choux.\n\nThere was also a lot of culture shock. I didn't speak much French before going to pastry school. I remember going to the grocery store, just pointing at things, panicking, and apologizing profusely. That forced me to get serious and learn as much as I could before my internship.\n\nSometimes, I struggled with the same imposter syndrome I had while working in tech. Then I found those moments of joy when I'd pull a cake out of the oven, and it came out so well. My whole world exploded in the best way possible because it gave me the gift of having to push myself so much in such a short amount of time.\n\nEven during moments of doubt, I was excited to be in the kitchen and work with people every week, learning where I could grow and what my strengths were.\n\nI found joy every day, even in the French homework. I started out not knowing much French, and then I could actually speak to people in restaurants and navigate around the country. I didn't know what a meringue was, and now I can make a lemon meringue pie.\n\nI pulled myself out of that dark place I had been in while working in Big Tech. My spirits lifted being around people who loved talking about food and nerding out on pastry. We would gather for potlucks and eat all the desserts we could find at local patisseries. It was such a unique bonding experience. I was trusting myself and letting myself be as open as I could be.\n\nI don't miss Big Tech. I'm grateful that chapter of my life has closed, and I can focus on this one. I love working with my hands and not staring at a computer screen for eight hours a day.\n\nAfter pastry school, I was going to move to Paris. Then Disney Cruise Line reached out, and I knew I couldn't say no. I've worked on the Disney Treasure and Disney Wish ships as a demi chef de partie. I'm returning to the Treasure in March.\n\nThe goal is to open up my own patisserie in the Connecticut area. I would love to share my favorite desserts, play with the different ingredients I've learned about in France, and bring new things to the table we haven't seen in the States.\n\nI want to encourage people to follow their dreams. Sometimes, when you're in your 30s or older, you're scared to start over. But the truth is, you're not stuck. Now I get to travel the world and pour energy into my passion.\n\nLife doesn't have to stop just because you get older. If anything, it's beginning to open up — if you just allow it.",

The option will use flying electric vehicles created by startup Joby Aviation.\n\nJoby's aircraft can fit up to four passengers and are flown by commercial pilots, the companies said. Joby will operate four landing locations, or \"vertiports,\" in Dubai, connecting Dubai International Airport with a mall, a hotel on Palm Jumeirah, and the American University of Dubai.\n\nWhile Uber and Joby don't have immediate plans to bring the air taxis to the US, the companies said that Joby is in the final stage of certifying its service with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\"We've long believed in the power of advanced air mobility to transform how people move through cities,\" Sachin Kansal, Uber's Chief Product Officer, said.\n\nThe Uber partnership makes \"this new mode of transportation familiar and accessible, connecting the ground and the sky through a system designed to save people time and fit seamlessly into how they already move,\" said Eric Allison, Joby's chief product officer.\n\nPassengers will be able to book Uber Air rides on Joby aircraft alongside regular ride-hailing trips, the companies said. Air taxi trips will also include Uber Black pickup and drop-off from passengers' origin and destination.\n\nOnce approved, Joby plans to eventually offer its service in markets including New York, Los Angeles, the UK, and Japan.\n\nJoby's planned Dubai debut comes almost six years after the startup acquired Uber Elevate, the ride-hailing app's air mobility division. Under the 2020 deal, Uber invested $75 million in the company.\n\nIt was one of multiple divisions that Uber shed as transportation demand cratered during the first year of the pandemic. Around the same time, Uber sold its self-driving car division to startup Aurora — something it made up for last year by announcing a partnership with Lucid and Nuro for robotaxis.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce could be making their \"Love Story\" official this summer at a luxurious Rhode Island hotel.\n\nPage Six reported in December that the celebration could unfold at one of Rhode Island's most storied seaside hotels, just steps from Swift's Watch Hill mansion.\n\nThe outlet reported that the couple plans to tie the knot at Ocean House in Westerly, a historic Gilded Age-era beachfront property that first opened in 1868 and has since been meticulously restored into a five-star retreat overlooking the Atlantic.\n\nOcean House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the reports.\n\nI visited Ocean House in December to dine at its bistro restaurant and see firsthand why the Grammy winner might choose the grand yet intimate resort as a wedding venue.\n\nHere's what it's like to visit and dine at Ocean House — and why it fits the bill for a Swift-worthy celebration.\n\nAbout an hour from Newport, Watch Hill has a population of around 200 residents and is known for its classic New England charm, sweeping Atlantic Ocean views, and grand seaside homes.\n\nLocated on the shores of Westerly, Ocean House acted as a quintessential New England summer retreat for affluent families looking to vacation by the sea.\n\nThe hotel closed in 2003 due to structural deterioration, but was later rebuilt to replicate its original look. It reopened in 2010.\n\nThis wasn't my first time at Ocean House — I've also been during the summer, when guests and visitors can take cocktails from the downstairs bar out to the hotel's expansive grounds, play croquet, and admire the ocean views.\n\nAlthough it was much darker and colder when I visited this time, I could still appreciate the hotel's historic charm and grandeur.\n\nMy family of three made our dinner reservation at the hotel's bistro restaurant, which is more low-key than its fine-dining restaurant, about two weeks in advance. In my experience, it can be hard to get reservations during peak seasons, such as summer and the holidays.\n\nThe front entryway was decorated with a large woven rug, as well as decorations for its Peter-Pan-themed New Year's Eve party.\n\nGuests of the hotel, as well as diners at the hotel's restaurants, milled around the lobby — it was buzzy without being overly crowded.\n\nPictures of sailboats and even a painting of those lost on the Titanic adorned the lobby walls.\n\nIn addition to hotel accommodations, the resort offers a \"land and sea\" experience, in which guests can book a stay aboard a restored 1937 yacht that once carried famous guests such as Shirley Temple, Fred Astaire, Nelson Rockefeller, and President Roosevelt, according to the hotel.\n\nThe hotel has 49 guest rooms and 20 signature suites. If Swift and Kelce do plan to house overflow guests at the hotel, it would be shaping up to be a smaller, more intimate wedding rather than a massive celebrity bash.\n\nHowever, the nearby Westerly State Airport would potentially allow private jets to fly in and out of the area with relative ease.\n\nOcean House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on whether Swift will be tying the knot at the resort.\n\nHowever, room rates surge sharply around Swift's rumored wedding date of June 13. A one-night stay on June 12 or June 13 is listed at $9,544, compared with $2,073 for the following Friday and Saturday. When attempting to book those mid-June dates, the hotel's website also indicates that no rooms are currently available.\n\nThe bistro is open year-round and serves \"casual, seasonally inspired dishes,\" while COAST is the hotel's fine-dining restaurant.\n\nDuring the warmer months, guests can also visit the Verandah Raw Bar, Dalia, which is a tapas restaurant, and Théa at Dune Cottage, a beachside restaurant reserved for hotel guests.\n\nThe overall vibe of the restaurant was elevated but comfortable, with lush seating and rich wooden tables throughout the room.\n\nAfter a few glasses of chardonnay to start the meal, we asked our waiter what he thought about the rumors surrounding Swift getting married at the resort this summer.\n\nUnsurprisingly, he declined to share details. However, he noted that if a high-profile wedding were taking place at the hotel, most staff members likely wouldn't be informed until the day of — or shortly beforehand — to minimize the risk of media leaks and large crowds gathering on the property.\n\nInformation-gathering aside, we were also there for dinner. We started with calamari ($22) and a side of crispy Brussels sprouts ($12).\n\nIt was more than enough to satisfy four people, and while it was fried to a rich golden brown, it didn't feel heavy. It was perfectly crispy and flavorful.\n\nTopped with crispy bacon, the Brussels sprouts were the ideal balance of rich flavor and freshness.\n\nThe short rib ($45) is a staple on the restaurant's winter menu. The menu changes seasonally, switching out heartier dishes like this one for lighter fare like seafood as the weather warms up.\n\nHowever, dishes like steak, scallops, and fish appear to be mainstays year-round.\n\nThe scallops ($50) were sourced from nearby Stonington, Connecticut, a coastal town known for its sweet, briny shellfish harvested from the cold waters of the Long Island Sound.\n\nThey arrived nestled atop a smoky almond romesco with fava beans and chorizo slices, which added subtle heat and richness. The scallops had a beautifully caramelized sear that gave way to a plump, buttery interior.\n\nServed with garlic butter and a side of bearnaise sauce, the grilled hanger steak ($40) was cooked to medium-rare perfection. The fries were crispy yet light and were perfectly salted.\n\nEvery bite melted in our mouths — for such a simple dish, we were impressed, and thought the price point was reasonable.\n\nThe hazelnut tart ($14) combined a chocolate flavor profile with slightly tart raspberry sauce, creating the perfect bite to finish the meal.\n\nIncluding a bottle of wine, two appetizers, three entrées, and dessert, our meal came to $292.72.\n\nOcean House strikes a rare balance between grandeur and privacy, with excellent food and hospitality from the hotel's discreet staff, who are willing to keep all wedding details under wraps.\n\nAdd in its location just steps from Watch Hill's quiet village center — and minutes from Swift's own Rhode Island home — and it's easy to see how the historic resort offers the exclusivity, romance, and coastal New England charm fit for a pop superstar's summer wedding.",

    "fullText": "He was at the heart of 1960s counterculture, then paved the way for the libertarian mindset of Silicon Valley. At 87, Brand is still keen to ensure the world is maintained properly – not just today, but for the next 10,000 years\n\nStewart Brand thinks big and long. He thinks on a planetary scale – as suggested by the title of his celebrated Whole Earth Catalog – and on the longest of timeframes, as with his Long Now Foundation, which looks forward to the next 10,000 years of human civilisation. He has had a lifelong fascination with the future, and anything that could get us there faster, from space travel to psychedelic drugs to computing. In fact, he was arguably the bridge between the San Francisco counterculture of the 60s and present-day Silicon Valley: in his commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005, Steve Jobs eulogised the Whole Earth Catalog and Brand’s philosophy, and echoed its farewell mantra: “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”\n\nYou could say that Brand has also lived big and long. He is now 87 years old, in the final chapters of an eventful and adventurous life that has crossed paths with some of the most consequential events and figures of his era. He has been a writer, an editor, a publisher, a soldier, a photojournalist, an LSD evangelist, an events organiser, a future-planning consultant, even a government adviser (to the California governor Jerry Brown in the late 70s). “There was a time when people asked me, ‘What do you do?’ I said, ‘I find things and I found things,’” says Brand, as in he is a founder. He is speaking from a library where he likes to work in Petaluma, California, not far from his houseboat in Sausalito. “I’m always searching for good stuff to recommend, and good people.”\n\nIn light of his epic life, Brand’s latest project hinges on what sounds like the most mundane topic imaginable: maintenance. It is “not automatically an exciting concept,” Brand readily admits, but once he started thinking about it, he realised you could view just about everything in terms of it, and a lot could be revealed by doing so: “Maintenance is what keeps everything going. It’s what keeps life going.”\n\nHis new book is titled Maintenance: Of Everything, Part One. It is the first of a planned 13 instalments, Brand explains, and it deals with the most literal, material forms of maintenance. Subsequent instalments will investigate everything from buildings to communities, institutions to the human body, plus planetary and environmental maintenance. So perhaps not such a departure after all in terms of long, big thinking. “I fell into it realising it was a tremendously ambitious thing, because I was going to be writing about a range of things I know nothing about,” he jokes.\n\nIn this first instalment, Brand’s magpie curiosity roves freely across industrial history, from round-the-world yacht racing to vehicle manufacturing to encyclopedias to the refurbishment of the Statue of Liberty. The military comes up a lot, “because the military is so maintenance-dependent and maintenance-aware”, he says, pointing out that he served in the US army himself for two years in the early 60s.\n\nWars have been won and lost on the strength of maintenance, Brand notes. In the Vietnam war, for example, the US army’s M16 rifle was lighter, more accurate and more precisely machined; the Viet-Cong’s AK-47s were more crudely made but therefore easier to fix and less likely to go wrong. Many American GIs lost their lives as a result of jammed M16s. Similarly, Russia’s attempted full-scale invasion of Ukraine faltered in its first days in part due to poorly maintained tyres on its long-mothballed trucks, which reflected a broader Russian doctrine of “treating equipment and soldiers as expendable”, as opposed to Ukraine’s flexible, Nato-influenced maintenance culture.\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, Brand expresses approval for Elon Musk. “What I find so admirable about Musk is that he keeps pushing the envelope of the possible in manufacturing,” he says. Just as Henry Ford revolutionised car manufacturing in the early 20th century with his Model T (which broke down a lot but was relatively easy to fix), so Musk’s Tesla has been a quantum leap, Brand argues. It catalysed the electric vehicle revolution, which has had an invaluable environmental impact. But Tesla also devised an ingenious way to make the entire underbody of its Model Y cars out of just two pieces of cast aluminium, whereas conventional cars used hundreds of parts that had to be welded, bonded, riveted together. Electric motors also have far fewer parts than internal combustion engines. Fewer parts means less to go wrong, which means less maintenance. This is how technology gets better, he says.\n\nThe flipside is, we now expect things to work all the time. “Most consumer products pretty much don’t require maintenance. You get an electric clock and plug it into the wall or change the batteries from time to time, and it’ll tell perfectly good time. You don’t have to do anything else. So there’s a getting out of the habit of expecting to do maintenance, and then when the thing has a problem, we’re offended: ‘Well, it’s not supposed to do that.’” For this reason Brand is also a huge fan of YouTube, where you can find lessons and instructions on how to fix just about anything. “We have higher expectations of not needing to maintain things, and lots of good ways to find out how to maintain them when we encounter a problem. So that’s basically progress, as far as I’m concerned.”\n\nBrand is now thinking about institutions in terms of maintenance, he says, and he has plenty of material. We’re speaking shortly after the Davos economic forum, where Donald Trump’s attempts to “acquire” Greenland came to a head, and the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, declared that there was a “rupture” in the “rules-based international order”. Rather than progress, we seem to be going in reverse here.\n\nLike the electronic clock, perhaps we’ve become so accustomed to the global order working (at least for powerful western nations), when it starts breaking we don’t know how to fix it. Brand is relatively relaxed, though. Some institutions might falter, others might prevail, or come back in a different form, he says. Davos is a good example of both: “Carney could say: ‘We’re having a rupture. And here’s a way to rethink ordering for the middle-level nations.’ So that was a great case of acknowledging an institution that’s in trouble – at an institution that was not in trouble: Davos.”\n\nBrand has been trying to foster a similar vein of long-term thinking with the Long Now Foundation. He co-founded it 30 years ago “to get people comfortable with thinking about not just the next 10,000 years, but more importantly, the last 10,000 years: we’ve come a long way, baby. How did that happen?” The idea began with an email conversation with the computer scientist and inventor Danny Hillis in 1994. They were discussing the year 2000, which had long been considered “the future”, but was then just six years away. The plan became to create an artwork “that would help pop through this membrane of the year 2000 for people, and let them take on various degrees and sizes of future, and not just the next decade”. Hillis conceived the Clock of the Long Now – a mechanical timepiece that would chronicle the next 10,000 years (the name came from Brian Eno, another collaborator). He had approached a lot of people with the idea, but, typically, it was Brand who responded and said: “OK. Let’s build the clock.”\n\nImprobable as it sounds, the clock is almost finished, buried a few hundred feet into a mountaintop in Texas. The land and the money were donated by the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos. It’s really a giant work of land art, Brand explains. “There’s a statue of liberty in New York, and this is kind of a statue of responsibility. It’s beautifully engineered and beautifully constructed and designed as an experience … it’s going to be a day in your life you’ll never forget.” And maybe it will inspire visitors to think as big and long as Brand does. “It would be nice to have an institution of thinkers and explainers that can last as long as the clock does.” The foundation’s other initiatives have included a series of seminars on long-term thinking (hosted by Brand), a library of “books you would want to restart civilisation from scratch”, and a project to preserve all the world’s languages.\n\nThis benign global scope has always been a hallmark of Brand’s brand, combined, paradoxically, with a sense of entrepreneurship and individualism. The opening words of the first Whole Earth Catalog, for example, were: “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.” Born in Illinois, in relative privilege, he came of age in a postwar America that felt it had largely figured out the “operating manual for spaceship Earth”, as the forward-looking designer Richard Buckminster Fuller put it at the time. Atom bombs, computers, vaccines, space travel – anything seemed possible.\n\nBrand combined these grand ambitions with a human-scaled ethos of empowerment. The strapline of the Whole Earth Catalog was “access to tools”, and it was meant in the broadest sense. The huge, thick directory, first published in 1968, listed all kinds of literal tools for the budding commune-dweller – from seed drills to footwear, kayaks to macrame kits – but it also championed books on all manner of hippy-era interests: esoteric religions, sociology, architecture, philosophy, science, the occult, how to talk to dolphins, you name it. Ideas are tools too, Brand points out. As such, the Whole Earth Catalog offered access to a multitude of alternative lifestyles. “It opened doors for people in a way that invited them to consider, ‘maybe I could just build a guitar, or live off the grid.’ And so it had the impact of conferring agency,” he says.\n\nThe Whole Earth Catalog became a huge bestseller in the late 60s and 70s, which made Brand a lot of money – too much for his liking, in fact. In the early 70s he wound the publication down and founded the Point Foundation, which gave grants to worthy causes, though he continued to publish books and periodicals in a Whole Earth spirit until the early 2000s.\n\nOne of the key schisms of the counterculture was a tension between the technologists and the environmentalists. The former embraced space exploration and computing; the latter condemned industrial civilisation and consumer society as inherently destructive. Brand straddled both camps. He saw how they could complement each other. That Nasa image of the whole Earth, for example, he points out, galvanised conservation movements such as Earth Day and Greenpeace, but it “was a direct result of something that environmentalists hated, which was the space programme”.\n\nPredictably, Brand was in on the ground floor when it came to computers. In 1968 he was a camera operator at what is now known as “the mother of all demos” – a seismic event put on by the Stanford Research Institute showcasing what we would recognise today as the foundations of personal computing: windows, hypertext links, video conferencing, even navigation using a then-unheard-of “mouse”. In a 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand declared personal computing to be “good news, maybe the best since psychedelics”. “Actually quite a lot better,” he says today. “Because one of the things that soon became apparent was that psychedelics kind of levelled off”, whereas computers have been “an exponential takeoff”: Moore’s law (the doubling of processing power every two years), the internet, and now artificial intelligence – we’re still on that path.\n\nHaving lived through the rapid rise and fall of the commune movement, Brand saw the potential of online community early on. In 1984 he organised the Hackers Conference (these were the days when “hacking” simply meant “doing cool stuff with computing”), at which he coined the now-familiar maxim “information wants to be free”. A year later he co-founded the Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link (Well) as a sort of proto social media platform, with discussion forums on various topics. Meanwhile, many of Brand’s Whole Earth crew went on to found Wired magazine in 1993 (Brand features in the first issue, interviewing Camille Paglia).\n\nTo his critics, Brand paved the way for the neoliberal, libertarian mindset of today’s Silicon Valley. But he was also a community-focused idealist and a lifelong environmentalist. That technology v nature tension persists – hence his apparent affinity with tech figures such as Bezos and Musk. He’s still ambivalent: “Finding anything that is an absolutely unmitigated benefit is pretty rare,” he says. But “I would say the benefits of personal computers and smartphones and the internet vastly reached beyond, in good terms, what we imagined at the time.”\n\nIn terms of physical maintenance, Brand has always been a healthy, active, outdoorsy person – he was a keen sailor, he was hiking up mountains with rocks in his backpack in his 60s, and he started going to CrossFit when he was 75 – “that built a pretty strong constitution”. Now, though, he has a respiratory illness, he says, “which is progressive, incurable and fatal”. He’s in a stable condition, and still exercises, but uses supplementary oxygen as well. “I’d be very surprised by making it into my 90s,” he says, seemingly without regret: “Imagine the luck, to get to be 87 – it’s just fantastic!”\n\nBrand has always been an optimist, he says, and taking the long view, he still is. “I find optimism in terms of being able to find a way to not only continue but keep getting better.” It might be hard to see a positive way forward right now, but that’s always been the way, he says. Brand brings up yet another of his incarnations, the Global Business Network, a consultancy he was part of in the 90s that mapped out future scenarios to help clients plan ahead. “It’s harder to imagine how something might go well than go badly,” he says. But we do not need to passively accept our fate as if we have no control over it. “If you like some scenarios better than others, you can be aware of the ones you don’t like and look for signs of them, and also look at signs of the ones you want to have come to pass, and lean differentially toward them. That’s how you negotiate your way into a future you were glad of. It’s done incrementally by, among other things, lots of individuals and some institutions, and that’s how we grapple our way, muddle our way forward.”",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Alvi Choudhury claiming damages against Thames Valley police after biased technology confused him with man looking ‘10 years younger’\n\nPolice arrested a man for a burglary in a city he had never visited after face scanning software deployed across the UK confused him with another person of south Asian heritage.\n\nAlvi Choudhury, 26, a software engineer, was working at the home he shares with his parents in Southampton in January when police knocked on his door, handcuffed him and held him in custody for nearly 10 hours before releasing him at 2am.\n\nThames Valley police had used automated facial recognition software which matched him with footage of a suspect of a £3,000 burglary 100 miles away in Milton Keynes, according to documents shared with the Guardian by Liberty Investigates.\n\nBut the CCTV footage showed a noticeably younger man with different features apart from similar curly hair, said Choudhury, who was left confused about why he had been arrested.\n\n“I was very angry, because the kid looked about 10 years younger than me,” said Choudhury, who wears a beard. “Everything was different. Skin was lighter. Suspect looked 18 years old. His nose was bigger. He had no facial hair. His eyes were different. His lips were smaller than mine.\n\n“I just assumed that the investigative officer saw that I was a brown person with curly hair and decided to arrest me.”\n\nUK police forces use an algorithm procured by the Home Office from Cognitec, a German company. It runs about 25,000 monthly searches against around 19m police mugshots held on the UK-wide police national database. Facial matches should be treated as intelligence, not fact, according to the National Police Chiefs’ Council. Thames Valley police said the decision to arrest Choudhury was made after a human visual assessment as well.\n\nBut the technology was revealed in December to produce a far higher rate of false positives for black (5.5 %) and Asian (4.0 %) faces than for white faces (0.04 %) at certain settings, according to Home Office commissioned research. Police and crime commissioners warned of “concerning in-built bias”, and said that while “there is no evidence of adverse impact in any individual case, that is more by luck than design”.\n\nSince December, Thames Valley police has also been deploying live facial recognition technology to scan the public in locations in Oxford, Slough, Reading, Wycombe and Milton Keynes. It has captured about 100,000 faces, leading to six arrests.\n\nGiven the differences between the man on the CCTV and his own face, Choudhury assumed he would be quickly freed. He offered evidence of work meetings in Southampton on the day of the crime but he was instead taken into custody.\n\nChoudhury is claiming damages against Thames Valley police and Hampshire constabulary, which executed his arrest. His neighbours saw him being led away in handcuffs, his father was very anxious about him being held and he was unable to work the following day, he said. He is also calling for greater transparency about the number of wrongful arrests involving facial recognition technology.\n\nChoudhury’s mugshot was held on the police system only because he had been wrongly arrested in 2021 when he had been attacked on a night out while at university in Portsmouth. The police released him with no further action. Now he has had a second mugshot taken he is afraid the automated system could trigger more wrongful arrests.\n\n“In my head, if a brown person in Scotland robs a bank are they going to come and arrest me?” he said.\n\nHe sometimes needs security clearance to work for government clients and he is asked about arrests and said: “This makes me look dodgier and dodgier.”\n\nThames Valley police admitted to Choudhury the arrest “may have been the result of bias within facial recognition technology”. But an officer told him that “as the use of facial recognition is already subject to review at a strategic level, I do not feel the need to raise this issue as part of wider organisational learning”.\n\nA Thames Valley police spokesperson denied the arrest was unlawful and said: “While we apologise for the distress caused to the complainant in this case, their arrest was based on the investigating officers’ own visual assessment that the individual matched the suspect in CCTV footage following a retrospective facial recognition match, and was not influenced by racial profiling.”\n\nBut Choudhury said officers at the Hampshire police station laughed when he asked: “Does this look anything like me?” And he said the Thames Valley police officers who arrived to interview him said “they knew I wasn’t the suspect after looking at footage of the suspect and looking at my picture”.\n\nWarnings have been repeatedly raised about the use of automated facial recognition technology. In December 2024 the UK’s biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner, William Webster, voiced concern that police continued to retain and use images of people who, having been arrested, were never subsequently been charged or summonsed. Last month, South Wales police paid damages to a black man who was wrongfully arrested and held for 13 hours after facial recognition technology.\n\nChoudhury’s lawyer, Iain Gould, a partner at DPP Law, said police “must ensure that artificial intelligence is not substituted for human intelligence and due diligence, but instead is used in careful partnership with it”.\n\nThe Home Office said guidance and training to minimise error and maintain public confidence in retrospective facial recognition was under review by the Police Inspectorate. It said a new national facial matching system is under development, with an improved, independently tested algorithm.",

    "fullText": "Officers say flood of low-quality reports is draining resources and slowing cases amid New Mexico lawsuit\n\nMeta’s use of artificial intelligence software to moderate its social media platforms is generating large volumes of useless reports about cases of child sexual abuse, which are draining resources and hindering investigations, said officers from the US Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce.\n\n“We get a lot of tips from Meta that are just kind of junk,” Benjamin Zwiebel, a special agent with the ICAC taskforce in New Mexico, said last week during his testimony in the state’s trial against Meta. The state’s attorney general alleges the company’s platforms are putting profits over child safety. Meta disputes these allegations, citing changes it has introduced on its platforms, such as teen accounts with default protections. The ICAC taskforce is a nationwide network of law enforcement agencies coordinated with the US Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute online child exploitation and abuse cases.\n\nAnother ICAC officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said: “Meta is providing thousands of tips each month. It’s pretty overwhelming because we’re getting so many reports, but the quality of the reports is really lacking in terms of our ability to take serious action.” The ICAC officer added that the total number of cybertips their department had received doubled from 2024 to 2025.\n\nThe unviable tips from Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, in some instances contain information that is not criminal, both Zweibel and two ICAC officers said. Tips sometimes contain information indicating a crime may have occurred, yet vital images, videos or text are missing or redacted, the anonymous officers added.\n\n“[Unviable tips from] Instagram have really skyrocketed recently, especially in the last couple of months, and that’s one of the biggest places where we’re seeing this information not being provided,” the ICAC officer added. “In those cases, we don’t have the information to further the investigation. It weighs on you to know that this crime occurred, but we can’t identify the perpetrator.”\n\nAsked about Zweibel’s testimony and the ICAC officers’ remarks, a Meta spokesperson said: “We’ve supported law enforcement to prosecute criminals for years: the DoJ has repeatedly praised our fast cooperation that has helped lead to arrests, and NCMEC has praised our streamlined and ‘improve[d]’ tip reporting process. In 2024, we received over 9,000 emergency requests from US authorities and resolved them within an average of 67 minutes – and even more quickly for cases involving child safety and suicide. Consistent with applicable law, we also report apparent child sexual exploitation imagery to NCMEC and support them to prioritize reports, from helping build their case management tool to labeling cybertips so they know which are urgent.”\n\nThe company pointed out that the agent, Zweibel, recommended the use of Meta’s teen accounts feature during his testimony, which he said he did “because it is the only option available, assuming that teens will not abstain from the use of social media”.\n\nRaúl Torrez, the New Mexico attorney general who is leading the case against Meta, has acknowledged the company’s cooperation in providing leads on child abuse at the trial: “I do want to credit some of the social media applications and platforms, including Meta, to a certain extent they do report images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.”\n\nFilings released in the case on Friday show Meta executives sounding internal alarms over the company’s ability to police child sexual abuse and alert law enforcement in early 2019. At the time, the company was preparing to enable end-to-end encryption in Facebook Messenger, which hides users’ messages from anyone but the intended recipient via cryptography.\n\n“We are about to do a bad thing as a company. This is so irresponsible,” wrote Monika Bickert, Meta’s head of content policy.\n\nBickert wrote that there would be “no way to find the terror attack planning or child exploitation” if Messenger’s contents were encrypted, which could hinder working with law enforcement. Bickert also said Meta was making “gross misstatements of our ability to conduct safety operations”, according to the internal documents.\n\nIn another document, Meta employees estimated that encrypting Messenger would have rendered the company “unable to provide data proactively to law enforcement in 600 child exploitation cases, 1,454 sextortion cases, 152 terrorist cases, 9 threatened school shootings”.\n\nAndy Stone, a Meta spokesman, told Reuters: “The concerns raised in 2019 represent the very reason we developed a range of new safety features to help detect and prevent abuse, all designed to work in encrypted chats.”\n\nChild safety groups criticized the encryption of Messenger, which eventually rolled out in 2023.\n\nMeta is by far the largest reporter to NCMEC. In its data report for 2024, NCMEC said Meta made 13.8m reports across Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, out of 20.5m tips it received in total.\n\nNCMEC said that in 2024, more than 1m CyberTipline reports were linked to a specific US state, and those reports were made available to the ICAC taskforces around the country, as well as other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, for investigation.\n\nMeta and other social media companies use AI to detect and report suspicious material on their sites and employ human moderators to review some of the flagged content before sending it to law enforcement. The Guardian has previously reported that tips generated by AI that haven’t also been reviewed by a social media company employee often cannot be opened by a law enforcement officer without a warrant because of fourth amendment protections. This extra step also slows investigations of potential crimes, lawyers involved in such cases say.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said: “It’s unfortunate that court rulings have increased the burden on law enforcement by requiring search warrants to open identical copies of content we’ve already reviewed and reported. Our image-matching system finds copies of known child exploitation at a scale that would be impossible to do manually, and we work to detect new child exploitation content through technology, reports from our community, and investigations by our specialist child safety teams.”\n\nUnder the Report Act (Revising Existing Procedures On Reporting via Technology), which came into force in November 2024, online service providers must broaden and strengthen their reporting obligations by notifying NCMEC’s CyberTipline not only about child sexual abuse material but also about planned or imminent abuse, child sex trafficking and related exploitation; they must also preserve evidence for a longer period and face higher penalties if they knowingly fail to comply.\n\nSince the act passed, the number of unviable tips supplied by Meta has increased dramatically, which could be because the company is acting to ensure it is not falling foul of the law, two ICAC officers said. Many of these tips could not be construed as a crime, such as adolescent girls talking about which celebrity they find most attractive.\n\n“Based on my training and experience, it appears that they are being submitted through the use of AI, as these are common mistakes that an AI would make that a human observer would not,” Zwiebel said in court.\n\nIn contrast, Zwiebel’s department receives significantly fewer tips on legitimate cases of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) distribution from Meta than in previous years, he said.\n\nEvery tip that reaches an ICAC division must be reviewed, and the influx of unviable tips is taking time and resources away from investigating legitimate cases of child abuse, said two officers.\n\n“It is killing morale. We are drowning in tips and we want to get out there and do this work,” said one ICAC officer. “We don’t have the personnel to sustain that. There’s no way that we can keep up with the flood that’s coming in.”",

    "fullText": "The remarks made by Texas voter Sonya Bernhardt highlight the ongoing discussion about Jasmine Crockett’s electability, which some say is rooted in racial and gender bias.\n\nA Texas voter’s tearful admission that she didn’t vote for Jasmine Crockett in the upcoming Texas U.S. Senate primary election because she didn’t think the fiery U.S. congresswoman could win in the general election against the Republican nominee has gone viral.\n\n“We need a fighter. And I was so ready to vote for Jasmine Crockett, because I love her, but I voted for Talarico because we need somebody who can win,” said Sonya Bernhardt, a Houston voter who cast her early ballot ahead of the March 3 primary contest between Crockett and Texas State Rep. James Talarico.\n\nBernhardt explained that she loved Crockett’s fiery style as a politician and her ability to go toe-to-toe with Republicans, particularly in committee hearings on Capitol Hill. She told CNN, “That was one of the most difficult votes I’ve ever voted in my entire life.”\n\nBernhardt’s admission enraged Crockett’s supporters online, who called out what they saw as a continued issue of white women voting against their own interests and the prevailing bias against female candidates and candidates of color.\n\n“The question that she’s posing that we’ve seen throughout the course of this primary is the question around electability, and how electability is being framed, potentially through a racial lens, but also through a political lens,” said Jamarr Brown, a Democratic strategist and former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. “I think that some of them are looking at race of the candidate, gender of the candidate, and then also maybe some of her records.”\n\nHe told theGrio that Crockett’s reputation for “fighting Republicans in Congress” is likely causing some Texas voters to think Crockett “may not be able to appeal” to more moderate or disgruntled Republicans who are “suffering at the hands of the Trump administration.”\n\nHowever, Brown noted that, contrary to some beliefs, a Democrat pulling out a win in a traditionally Republican state like Texas doesn’t have to rely solely on conservative voters, or even white Democratic voters like Sonya.\n\n“White Democrats vote the lowest among any constituency in the party,” he told theGrio. “You have to look at Independents and whether they will cross over for either Democratic candidate? And I think they will, but it depends on who it is.”\n\nUltimately, Brown said the pathway to victory for any Democrat in the general election will rely on the party’s base, which includes Black, Hispanic AAPI voters and young voters.\n\nIn a state with the highest population of Black Americans in the country, the Texas operative explained, “I think that we’ve got to bank on working in a Democratic Party that is deepening their base and deepening their bench with a strong coordinated campaign.”\n\nIn an interview with theGrio, Jasmine Crockett expressed frustration with critics who question her electability simply because she is a Black woman.\n\n“We know that the most loyal voting bloc, when it comes to Democrats, no matter what part of the country you look at, is actually Black women. And it is all good for us to labor…we allow this party continue to say, yes, yes, yes, we need Black women, go ahead and pull up [but] we’re not even going to focus on spending our dollars to you, because we know y’all are gonna hold it down,” said Crockett. “No one is looking at the credentials. Like, holler at me and say that you have an issue as relates to my credentials.”\n\nTrump claims there’s almost no crime in DC, but numbers were dropping long before national guard deployment\n\n‘You have killed Americans!’: Rep.

    "fullText": "Perks of the job? Be careful how you use them.\n\nA flight attendants' union has warned its members not to use their free travel benefits on sick days.\n\n\"We have seen a significant increase in investigatory meetings related to pass travel violations in recent weeks,\" the Association of Flight Attendants chapter for Endeavor Air said in an email last Wednesday seen by Business Insider.\n\nEndeavor is a Delta Air Lines subsidiary that operates its regional Delta Connection flights.\n\n\"Specifically, we have seen multiple cases where Flight Attendants have utilized pass travel after calling out sick or while on [family and medical leave] or other approved leave,\" it added.\n\nPass travel allows airline employees and their family members to fly for free or at a reduced rate. They travel on standby, so they have to wait for available seats after all paying passengers have boarded. Crew members can also travel in a jumpseat.\n\nThe union's email pointed to the flight attendant manual, which says cabin crew can't use this benefit when they are sick or on protected leave, nor the days immediately surrounding said leave.\n\nThere are some cases where it is OK, however. The union's collective bargaining agreement allows flight attendants to use their travel benefits when returning home after calling in sick, it added.\n\nThe union reminded members to wait for their manager's written approval before doing this.\n\nViolations of the policy, it said, have resulted in a written warning and the suspension of pass travel privileges.\n\nDelta declined to comment when reached by Business Insider. The AFA and a representative for the Endeavor Air chapter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Endeavor union's warning comes as United Airlines has stepped up its scrutiny of staff's sick leave.\n\n\"Perceived sick leave abuse is now the most frequent reason for termination cases across the system,\" United's AFA chapter said in an email last Thursday.\n\nUnited is using technology to track when sick leave is used in relation to paid time off or vacation, which it takes \"as an apparent red flag for sick leave abuse,\" the union added.\n\nHowever, it also outlined scenarios where flight attendants might be innocently using sick leave that the company could question.\n\nFor example, if somebody falls ill on vacation and can't return home, the airline might think they were extending their vacation. The union advised members to keep all documentation that could show they weren't abusing sick leave.",

    "description": "Andrew Left says SanDisk is vulnerable to competition from Samsung, which has the power to flood the market with cheaper memory capacity.",
    "fullText": "Andrew Left thinks he sees a big mismatch between investor perception and reality when it comes to SanDisk stock.\n\nSanDisk has been on a tear, surging more than 1,200% in six months as the market eyes a shortage of memory capacity that's driving up pricing power for companies in the space. Yet, Left thinks the stock is highly overvalued, laying out in an X post why his firm, Citron Research, is shorting the shares.\n\nLeft has expressed skepticism that certain tech stocks can continue to rally, citing fellow AI standout Palantir as another example of an overhyped and overvalued name. He used a different company to illustrate the problem he sees with SanDisk, though.\n\n\"The market is pricing SanDisk like it's $NVDA,\" Left wrote. \n\"There's one problem: NVIDIA has a moat. SanDisk sells a commodity. We've seen this movie before 2008, 2012, 2018. It's never different this time. Memory is a cycle, and cycles peak.\"\n\nSanDisk, Left says, is particularly vulnerable to competition from Samsung, which he calls the \"800-pound gorilla\" that's been in the space for 30 years.\n\nLeft's post comes as markets reprice certain AI trades, with a brutal sell-off in recent weeks hammering many tech sectors.\n\nBut in his view, the bigger problem isn't new companies disrupting the space, but a bigger incumbent muscling into SanDisk's territory. Left thinks Samsung will ultimately flood the industry with lower-cost memory chips, leaving SanDisk unable to compete.\n\n\"They're not just the capacity gorilla anymore,\" Left said, of Samsung. \"They're going after SanDisk's best customers with cheaper, newer technology. And the only thing keeping supply tight right now? Samsung's temporary yield problems in another product line. \nThat bottleneck has an expiration date.\"\n\nWhen it reaches that inflection point, Left expects SanDisk stock to start trading at lower levels, though he has not specified a price target.\n\n\"Shorting [SNDK] is skating to where the puck is going,\" he wrote. \"By the time the cycle normalizes, this stock will already be much lower.\n\nLeft isn't the only finance pro who sees it as an effective short play.

    "description": "There are a few things I wish I had known before my first cruise with my family. Next time, I'll turn my phone on airplane mode and pack formal wear.",
    "fullText": "2024 was a big year in our household. All three kids were graduating — our oldest from high school and our twins from junior high.\n\nWhen it came time to celebrate these achievements, we gave them an option. We could throw a party or use the money for an awesome family vacation instead.\n\nSo, before our oldest left for college, we came together one last time for a seven-day trip to Alaska on our first-ever cruise.\n\nWe were all excited about the idea, and honestly, everyone had a fantastic time. However, I don't think any of us were completely prepared our first cruising experience.\n\nHere are four things I wish we had known before boarding the Celebrity cruise ship.\n\nOur phones are such an important part of our lives that it's almost unheard of to go without them for minutes, let alone days. However, we purposely didn't purchase the ship's WiFi package because we wanted a chance to disconnect and enjoy Alaska's beauty.\n\nWhat we were unaware of, however, is that once we got away from land, we should've put our phones on airplane mode. Since we didn't, they switched to a service called Cellular at Sea, which uses satellites to keep the phones connected. However, this can be expensive.\n\nLuckily, after racking up $100 in charges within hours of setting sail, AT&T cut my device off until I contacted them. However, this was a costly lesson.\n\nNext time, we'll be sure to turn on airplane mode and call our cellular provider to talk about cruise packages.\n\nWe're typically a jeans and T-shirt family. It's not that we don't clean up well; it's just that we don't do it often. So, a formal night wasn't even on our radar.\n\nWe knew we needed nicer clothing for our dinner reservations on the ship, but we didn't know that one night, everyone would go all out.\n\nWe skipped dinner that night and hit the buffet instead (which, honestly, we did more often than not anyway), and we certainly weren't the only ones not dressed up.\n\nHowever, I wish we had known about this in advance, as it would have been exciting to join in on the fun.\n\nIt's no secret that cruising can be expensive. So, when it came time to book excursions, we knew they would be pricey. However, we still weren't prepared for just how pricey they would be.\n\nLuckily, almost every port we stopped at had third-party companies who would pick passengers up at the dock and take them to do fun and exciting things.\n\nFor example, being in Alaska, we wanted to learn about and visit a dog-sled team. Although the cruise line offered this experience, we saved more than 50% by booking with an outside party.\n\nHowever, it's important to know your schedule and check to make sure the third party will guarantee you'll be back on time — because if you're not, the ship won't wait for you.\n\nOn the days the ship doesn't stop at a port, the tables at breakfast, couches by the windows, and lounge chairs by the pool all become valuable real estate.\n\nInstead of waking up early to claim a space near the pool, we chose to sleep in instead. However, because of this, we should've been prepared to settle for a less-than-prime space to sit and relax.\n\nInstead of a view of the ocean and the mountains, we got stuck in the middle of the ship near the bathrooms.\n\nEven with these small missteps, none of it was enough to put even the slightest damper on what was a fabulous time aboard our first cruise. The next time we take to the seas, though, we'll be better prepared for what's to come.\n\nThis story was originally published on January 31, 2025, and most recently updated on February 25, 2026.",

    "description": "Business leaders and top economists weighed in on Trump's inflation claims, tariff push, and his plan for a federally backed retirement savings plan.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump delivered his annual address to Congress on Tuesday in what was the longest State of the Union in US history.\n\nThe two-hour remarks were light on new policy but heavy on familiar themes, including tariffs, lower consumer prices, and immigration.\n\nTrump also said that AI data centers could drive up utility bills and said tech companies should shoulder their own power needs.\n\nEconomists and business leaders are already weighing in on what he said — and what he didn't.\n\nHere is how some of the most prominent voices reacted:\n\nPaul Krugman framed the address as historically long and riddled with distortions, saying that Trump tried to paint an overly rosy picture despite affordability pressures that many households still feel.\n\nIn a Substack post headlined \"A SOTU Like No Other,\" Krugman described the speech as \"so little truth, so much time.\"\n\nHe said Trump failed to seriously grapple with the affordability problems he thinks are driving public pessimism — while \"doubling down\" on tariffs that he said would make those pressures worse.\n\n\"Was the plan to turn public opinion around by boring America into submission?\" he asked.\n\nIan Bremmer focused less on policy specifics and more on the atmosphere in the chamber, calling it a reflection of broader national polarization.\n\n\"Completely divided chamber of Congress reflecting a completely divided United States,\" Bremmer wrote on X.\n\nWhen asked if any of it was new, he later added, \"new? hardly. worse? absolutely.\"\n\nBill Ackman praised Trump's retirement-savings proposal — a federal savings plan modeled on the Thrift Savings Plan, with an annual government match of up to $1,000 — calling it one of the speech's most significant policy moments.\n\nAckman said that 46 million working Americans don't have a 401(k), pension, or similar plan, and said that a federally matched account could expand household wealth-building and reduce reliance on welfare programs over time.\n\nHe also predicted expanding the match could become a rare bipartisan win, writing: \"This is an amazing initiative for our country.\"\n\nPeter Schiff said that Trump's first-year inflation performance wasn't meaningfully better than former President Joe Biden's and predicted it could worsen.\n\n\"We may have changed presidents, but inflation remains the same,\" Schiff wrote on X, pointing to the consumer price index rising by 2.7% in Trump's first year versus 2.9% in Biden's last year.\n\nHe said that CPI would \"likely rise by more than 3%\" in Trump's second year.\n\n\"We may have changed presidents, but inflation remains the same,\" he added.\n\nRoger Altman said the president pulled a \"classic Trump\" and \"put on a show,\" but delivered a speech unlikely to move weak economic approval numbers.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, he said Trump described an economy that was \"roaring and couldn't be better,\" but said there's a \"disconnect\" because many Americans — especially lower-income households — \"are having a hard time.\"\n\nEven so, Altman struck a more upbeat tone on fundamentals, forecasting 2.5% to 2.75% growth, cooling inflation, and real wage gains as inflation ticks toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nOn trade, he warned tariffs may stick around: The revenue impact is so significant that it would be \"hard\" for either party to walk away from them, he said.",

    "title": "Goldman Sachs' top DEI executive exits for rival as Wall Street retreats from diversity under the Trump administration",
    "description": "Megan Hogan, a high-profile voice on Goldman's social impact initiatives, is headed to Morgan Stanley this spring, Business Insider has learned.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs' top diversity official has left for a rival in recent weeks, multiple people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Her exit comes as Wall Street retreats from long-stated DEI pledges about hiring and career advancement.\n\nMegan Hogan, Goldman's global co-head of talent left in January for Morgan Stanley, several people familiar with the matter said. Hogan, who joined the firm nearly 12 years ago, held the title of chief diversity officer until early 2025 before taking on the broader talent position for the past year.\n\nHogan confirmed the move via email on Tuesday, telling Business Insider that Morgan Stanley had extended her \"an amazing opportunity\" in talent development, which will begin when her garden leave expires. She declined to comment further.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, Hogan will serve as head of talent development, reporting to Susan Reid, the firm's global head of talent. Hogan will begin in April, a person familiar with the hire said.\n\nLike other Wall Street banks, Goldman Sachs spent years investing in workforce diversity initiatives, and Hogan was one of its most prominent faces focused on social impact issues. But when President Donald Trump returned to power last January, he issued an executive order ending DEI programming at government agencies and urging companies to follow suit. Goldman, like many of its peers, has since taken steps to scrub DEI language from public-facing materials.\n\nEarlier this month, the bank also agreed to remove race, gender identity, and sexual orientation from its board-member selection criteria following pressure from a conservative shareholder group, the Wall Street Journal reported. It also stopped highlighting specific DEI targets in annual reports, a practice that had been a staple of its post-2020 communications, and said it would sunset the \"aspirational hiring goals\" it established half a decade ago.\n\n\"This is a reflection of the changing legal environment and adapting to the reality of those legal shifts,\" a spokesperson for the bank told Business Insider, adding that the firm stands by the benefit of \"diverse perspectives and experiences,\" and is following the law while running programs designed to \"attract the best talent.\"\n\nLater this week, the bank is expected to name Lauren Uranker, another managing director who joined the firm about 14 years ago, as the new sole head of talent development, engagement, and management, according to a person with close knowledge of the bank's thinking. Uranker was appointed global co-head of talent alongside Hogan in mid-2025.\n\nIn her new position, Uranker's mandate is expected to concentrate on the transition to AI-supported work, team growth, and finding ways to engage and retain top employees. Her title has no direct references to DEI, but the position will still encompass programming designed to advance workplace inclusion, the source added.\n\nCorporate America — including financial services firms such as JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley— has eased use of the term \"DEI\" and associated language since early 2025. The Trump administration's rebuke of diversity-related programming continues to serve as a point of pride for Trump, who touted the crackdown during his State of the Union address to lawmakers on Tuesday night. \"We ended DEI in America,\" he said.\n\nGoldman had previously been among Wall Street's most vocal advocates for promoting inclusion in the workplace. In 2020, David Solomon, the bank's CEO, championed a series of policies like requiring companies to appoint diverse board members before his bankers would agree to help them go public — a rule the company killed last year. Stephanie Cohen, the bank's former chief strategy officer who departed in 2024, told Business Insider in 2020 that Goldman viewed these issues as more than perfunctory but vital for commercial success.\n\nHogan's predecessor, Erika Irish Brown, left for Citi in 2021 to lead DEI efforts there. Following Brown's departure, Hogan — who previously held the titles of head of Americas talent management and global head of diversity recruiting — assumed the chief diversity officer title the same year, but last year consolidated primarily on her \"global co-head of talent\" designation. Her exit compounds another long-standing struggle for the Wall Street bank: retaining senior female leaders. Goldman has faced blowback over whether it's done enough to support their career progress — an area where officials have acknowledged there's room for improvement.\n\nThough the firm has increased the total share of female managing directors by 3% since 2021, a spokesperson said, Solomon acknowledged this past fall that there was further to go. \"We've made a bunch of progress, especially in the senior ranks,\" he said at the Economic Club of Washington in October. But the results, he added, were \"candidly not enough, and we continue to be focused on creating opportunities.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "I spent 13 years building a life abroad in countries like Mexico and New Zealand, swearing I'd never go back to the US. Then, I moved to Seattle.",
    "fullText": "In 2010, my partner and I set off on what I thought was a gap year.\n\nAfter meeting while studying abroad in Switzerland back in 2008, we spent nearly two years in a long-distance relationship. We were ready to get back to our traveling roots and finally be together full-time.\n\nThe plan was to spend six months living and working in New Zealand, save up as much money as we possibly could, and then take those savings with us to travel through Australia and Southeast Asia.\n\nMy initial goal was to eventually land back on the East Coast, ready to start a master's program and get on with being a grown-up.\n\nWhat happened instead was that we spent 13 years in New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, Mexico, and finally Lithuania before finally making our way back to where we started … sort of.\n\nIt was September 2010. Instagram wouldn't launch until later that year. I didn't even have a smartphone.\n\nAll this is to say, finding like-minded people online wasn't possible for me. It wasn't until we got to New Zealand, stayed in hostels around the country, and worked temp jobs with other backpackers that we learned how many people were living a life on the road, devoting their lives to travel.\n\nThrough other travelers, I learned about the working holiday visa in Australia, an opportunity to teach English in South Korea, and how to explore Southeast Asia on a shoestring budget.\n\nI realized that countless other 20-somethings from around the world were shunning the blueprint created for them back home and building lives, at least for now, that offered them total freedom.\n\nFor the next decade, we lived around the world. We road-tripped through Australia's Red Center, navigated night markets in Taipei, and learned to scuba-dive in the Philippines.\n\nEvery day felt like an adventure, even the days filled with work, because I was living them somewhere entirely new. I vowed never to return to a \"normal life\" in New York.\n\nI often joke that Lithuania broke me. After five years in Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic forced us both to look for work elsewhere.\n\nWe landed in a small town in Lithuania in the middle of July 2021. The sun was up from 5 a.m. until 11 p.m., and the 85-degree temperature was perfect for long walks and swims in Lithuania's many lakes.\n\nSummer quickly turned to fall, which lasted about a week, and then by mid-October, winter had arrived. The endless summer days gave way to long winter nights. I spent many mornings in my kitchen with a cup of coffee at 8 a.m., looking out the window, still waiting for the sun to come up.\n\nThe winters were brutal, yes, but what living in rural Lithuania showed me most was that I had no ties, no community, and no one to call up on those dark, lonely mornings.\n\nA life free of ties, obligations, and responsibility was wonderful in my 20s, but as I turned 35 during my second winter in Lithuania, I felt unmoored.\n\nWhen my partner received a job offer in Seattle, we initially scoffed at it. I had spent 13 years promising everyone around me that I would never move back to the US.\n\nHowever, when another snowstorm came through in mid-April of that year, we sat down and started seriously considering returning to the US. I'm from New York, so I reasoned that Seattle would be a whole new adventure — almost like moving to a new country.\n\nThe biggest hurdle with coming back to live in the US was my own ego. I had to tell family, friends, and Instagram that I was coming home. It felt, in many ways, like I had failed.\n\nIt turned out to be the right move, though. After years abroad, it was a relief to settle back into an English-speaking country in a culture that I understood.\n\nThe ease of calling a plumber, communicating at the post office, and most of all, building deep, meaningful friendships all drew me closer to home.\n\nIt's been two years since I landed back in the country and signed a lease in Seattle. Although it's not perfect, living in five countries and traveling to 30 more has taught me that nowhere is — but right now, it's the best it's ever been.",

    "fullText": "My mother, Lysa Hall, was my world — and even now, after her death, she still feels present.\n\nAt 59, she was admitted to the hospital with a bad infection. She'd already endured countless surgeries throughout her life, but she remained the strongest person I knew.\n\nThis time, something small became life-altering. She quickly declined, becoming bedridden, and couldn't fend for herself.\n\nThat's when I stepped in as her primary caregiver — even though I was living in Los Angeles and she was in New York.\n\nWhen extra hands weren't available, I became the hands. It was an eight-month journey that taught me to grow up.\n\nI was frequently traveling back to New York to check my mother's mail and pay her bills. Months before any of this happened, she made me a secondary holder on her accounts. That access became essential, allowing me to pay what was due, keep receipts, and send her photos so she knew what was happening. It was her money, and I wanted her to be informed and respected.\n\nThe hardest part in the journey was discovering bills I didn't know existed, like some overdue hospital bills. Between calls, paperwork, and asking for extensions and grace, I was stretched thin while still working full-time within the entertainment industry.\n\nThrough it all, I watched my mother, who is my hero, fade right in front of me. But losing control was harder for her, so I focused on preserving her dignity and reminding her that needing help didn't erase who she was.\n\nWhen she died last May, it broke me. But I had promised her I would never leave her, and it still warms me to know I did everything I could to keep her safe and ease her stress. After everything she poured into me, I'm grateful I could pour back into her.\n\nSuddenly, there were no more calls to the nurse, no more reminders, and no more check-ins. My emotions were all over the place, but my faith anchored me.\n\nMy brother and I sat in our living room in shock. Her death didn't feel real. It felt like I was watching my life from the outside.\n\nHowever, there was still a lot to do. My job as a caregiver wasn't over. Thankfully, my brother swooped in and took the baton. He handled her affairs while I managed what I could. Telling our family and planning the funeral with my brother was intense, but our dad helped us through.\n\nSharing the load felt strange because every task we completed made her absence more permanent.\n\nAfter the funeral and remembering her with everyone else, I realized my role in her life hadn't ended; it just changed form.\n\nNow, I find myself protecting how people remember her and honoring her in many ways.\n\nIf something feels incomplete, I fill in the gaps so her legacy stays true. Keeping her traditions alive has become another way I care for her. Every Christmas, my mother and I went to Bergdorf Goodman, and then ended the day with dinner upstairs. This year, we did exactly that, and I cooked her famous lasagna with my sister-in-law, adding my own spin — keeping one ingredient exactly the same: love.\n\nWhile our chapter in the physical world has closed, a new one has opened. I don't just miss her; I feel guided by her.",

    "description": "Built on community feedback, ESW Beauty's rebrand focuses on clean ingredients and bold packaging. The company looks to generate $20 million in 2026.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to is based on a conversation with Elina Sofia Wang, founder of ESW Beauty, a Hazlet, New Jersey, clean skincare company that produces face masks, lip treatments, and eye patches. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nESW Beauty started from my wellness journey.\n\nI went through a battle with stomach ulcers for many years and got to a point where it was seriously detrimental to my daily life. So, I decided to eat and drink healthier.\n\nThe skincare aspect came from my experience working for my mom's small business that distributed K-beauty, starting when I was 16.\n\nI fell in love with skincare, especially face masks, and had the idea of creating a wellness-inspired skincare brand. The first idea was raw-juice face masks, which we launched in 2019.\n\nIt's been quite a journey, but I'm very appreciative of everything we've accomplished. We're now in 19,000 retail locations, including Target and Anthropologie. We have 18 employees, including me, and last year, we hit $11.4 million in revenue.\n\nIn late January, we launched a rebrand. It was a significant undertaking. But I felt like our packaging and visual identity no longer reflected our brand and the efficacy of our products.\n\nThe idea for the rebrand was simmering in my mind for a while, and I ultimately put my foot on the gas in the summer of 2025. The catalyst was talking to senior and female company founders, as well as my business advisors, and getting their feedback.\n\nTo start, we put ideas and polls on Instagram Stories and TYB, the community rewards platform. Our community gave feedback and helped us choose the new packaging.\n\nPeople loved the bolder, brighter colors and kept saying it felt more eye-catching. Overall, the feedback was that the new direction feels more emotionally engaging and draws them into the packaging in a bold, modern way that remains very ESW.\n\nWe know that aligns with our typical customer, a Gen Z girl, which we consistently see across our sales data, social analytics, and community behavior. Our strongest engagement comes from Gen Z-heavy platforms, like TikTok and Instagram, and that's reinforced by who's shopping on our website, joining our email list, and repeatedly buying our products.\n\nThese customers love bold, bright colors and have a fun, energetic personality. At the same time, I wanted to make sure consumers know our products have amazing formulas.\n\nOriginally, our packaging mainly highlighted our fruit and other extracts, like watermelon, rose water, and grapefruit.\n\nBut what drives the formula are the active ingredients, including hyaluronic acid, peptides, niacinamide, glacial water, and more. We always listed these, but they weren't highlighted as prominently on the front. We really brought that out on the rebranded packaging.\n\nWe also added dermatologist-tested and consumer-perception claims to the packaging to emphasize efficacy. And, we put \"Made in Korea\" on the front because it reflects who we are, and I think that brings trust.\n\nWe also made sure our logo was large and front and center. It's important for branding and making sure that people see who we are and recognize it right on the shelf.\n\nOur previous packaging was strong and stood out, but now people look at it and say, \"Wow, this new rebrand is just 10 times stronger.\"\n\nThe biggest risk with the rebrand was that it was capital-intensive, costing about $500,000. It was a full brand overhaul across every touchpoint of the business and both a creative investment and a large-scale operational transition across the entire company.\n\nThat included new visual identity development, including strategy, logo, packaging system, brand guidelines, as well as completely redesigning all primary packaging and secondary cartons, new molds, photography and creative direction, website redesign, and refreshed marketing collateral.\n\nOn the operations side, it also involved coordinating with manufacturers on new packaging components and production runs.\n\nThis spring, we're also launching full-size skincare, including a facial mist, serum, moisturizer, and eye cream, inspired by healthy beverages and wellness themes, plus clinically active ingredients. Some are made for sensitive skin, some for eczema-prone skin.\n\nThe rebrand and new skincare together will help drive revenue. Last year's was $11.4 million, and we're looking to make over $20 million in 2026.\n\nIn rebranding, it's important to carefully consider each decision and involve your community right away. The worst thing that could happen is you launch something that your community actually dislikes. The fact that we did that — we got everyone's feedback, they loved it, we got the positive comments — really helped build that foundation.",

    "description": "Jeff Probst breaks down his daily routine while filming \"Survivor 50\" in Fiji, including what he eats, where he sleeps, and behind the scenes secrets.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jeff Probst, the Emmy-winning host and showrunner of CBS's \"Survivor.\" For the premiere of the show's all-star fiftieth season, he walked us through a day of filming the reality series on the Mamanuca Islands in Fiji. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n\"Survivor\" is not a gig. For me and most people who work on the show, it really is our creative life. Every idea we have goes into the show.\n\nThe way we run the show has changed a lot in 26 years. In the early seasons, we went to a new country or a new island every season. That's an arduous task for our team because you're essentially building a city on an island, and then you're packing everything up and putting it on big shipping crates across the ocean. And when it gets there, you take it off, and you build a new city again. So the amount of work was huge.\n\nFor many seasons, me and the crew were living in tents — little single-person tents, and then we might have modular housing on another season. Once, we had very tiny trailers, and I mean tiny — they were maybe 12 feet long and eight feet high, and you had a bed, and that was basically it.\n\nNow that we've filmed in Fiji for 10 years, we have a routine. It doesn't change the demands of the actual show, but it does help the prep, and it gets rid of a lot of unforeseen problems.\n\nWorking on \"Survivor\" is a 26-day event from the morning of day one. Even though your day might technically start at 6 a.m. when you wake up and end at 10:30 p.m. when Tribal Council is over, the work doesn't really stop until the end of day 26.\n\nEspecially when you're one of the executive producers, there's always a radio next to your bed, and there's a radio in your boat, and there's a radio everywhere you go because the show is a living, breathing organism.\n\nThe good news is there aren't many distractions because there's nowhere to go. We live on a little island, and there are no restaurants; there isn't a movie theater. Friends don't really come and visit, and you don't go out to dinner — there's nowhere to go to dinner. So your life is very small, and that makes it very easy to focus.\n\nHere's a typical day in my life while filming \"Survivor 50.\"\n\nI have a home that is on the water in Fiji, so I wake up to the sounds of the ocean every morning.\n\nWhen you're in the middle of the ocean, there is no ambient light, so it's very easy to go to bed early because it's pitch black, and it's much easier to get up in the morning with the sun.\n\nAlmost every morning, I work out, mostly for my mental health. I have a small gym — I have a few pieces of gear that I've collected over the years, and we ship them to this little house. We literally build a false floor for them so that we don't hurt the house at all. I do very straightforward exercises with weights; nothing fancy. It gets the job done.\n\nI only do maybe 20 minutes, but I try to do it most days because I feel better when I do it. I feel like I let my body know, \"We're going back into war, let's go.\"\n\nWe have a catering team, and they make about 100,000 meals a year for our crew. So they're on set early in the morning, making breakfast. They also make lunch and dinner, and are sending crew meals out to all our teams on various beaches.\n\nI'm not a big eater in my normal life — I might eat one meal, or two meals a day at the most — but on location, I find my hunger increases. So I always have breakfast, and then around 1 p.m. I'm usually starving, and I'm often craving something. It's not always healthy. Sometimes it's a burger with fries and a lot of ketchup.\n\nWhatever I'm craving, I give in to it. I don't judge at all because the environment is so different. I think in a lot of ways I do emulate or replicate the same cravings the castaways have. Maybe that is because you're sweating a lot, and your body's being deprived of certain things, like you're losing salt.\n\nSo I don't eat burgers that often, but on location, I have one at least once a week. Then, when I get home, I'm back to a pretty healthy way of eating.\n\nSometimes, you start your day with a challenge rehearsal. That means we have everybody who's going to be shooting the challenge on that day, except the contestants.\n\nWe'll shoot the rehearsal with our Dream Team, who test the challenges. Because we don't get a second take. So our only chance to really look at how we're going to film the challenges is getting the Dream Team of people together and rehearsing it.\n\nWe will rehearse the entire challenge full-on. Then, when the players show up, and you shoot it, you're doing that with no retakes. We've never asked a player to go back and shoot a ball again. We live and die by our coverage.\n\nSometimes, I'll shoot a challenge with the players in the morning, have a quick break for lunch, and then 90 minutes later, I'll be out to rehearse the next challenge with the Dream Team.\n\nIn between that, I might drop by the art department to approve a new idol, or look at the wording on a note, or look at how we're going to hide an advantage, and see photographs of where it's going to be hidden.\n\nThe show never stops, and we're always looking ahead. We might be on shoot day three, but we're already looking at shoot day nine and planning what twists are going to happen and when they're going to go into the game.\n\nWhile \"Survivor 50\" is airing, we will be out shooting \"Survivor 51,\" but \"Survivor 50\" is still being edited. So I'll be giving my thoughts on the episode, and making sure it's ready to be delivered to the network, and then I might very well end the day filming a Tribal Council that ends around 10:30 p.m.\n\nYou can have some really long days, but they're incredibly exhilarating because it's the only thing you're doing. You're not in Los Angeles, where you go to your favorite restaurant, and you're still able to catch your kid's soccer game. None of that exists. It is only you, your team, and the show you're making.\n\nOne thing we do on \"Survivor,\" and this is not a formal rule, it's just our community, is if we show up for a challenge rehearsal or something, we'll spend 10 minutes talking about the latest episode of \"Game of Thrones\" or whatever show we're watching.\n\nI used to wonder, is this an efficient use of time? Because we seem to be bonding, but we're not working on the project at hand. And then my wife and I met Laszlo Bock, who formed the people culture at Google and wrote a book about it called \"Work Rules.\"\n\nOne of the things he talks about in his book is that time spent talking about your favorite TV episode or going bowling with your coworkers on a Tuesday night is fundamental to the harmony and cohesion that you're going to then take into battle, take into the workplace.\n\nSo I'm always aware now that that is something in our nature, to bond a little bit. It's not just work. It's a community living together, working together, but with the emphasis that we are also living together and we're friends.\n\nYou would think I would have a ritual for being on camera by now, but I really don't. But my coworkers have said they can tell when I'm getting into what they call \"the zone.\" That's when I stop listening, and I'm just thinking. All I'm really thinking about is just reminding myself, \"These 13 people are still in the game. They voted out seven people; they're tired, they're hungry.\"\n\nIt's just basic repetition of reminding myself that even though I have a life outside this game, and I might be looking at a cut from last episode, and I might be looking at an idea for next season, these players are in this season, and they demand and deserve my entire focus.\n\nI actively choose to be in the moment: I see that you're sad. I could tell when you walked in, your body language, you're hunched over.\n\nThe question is, am I going to bring it up? Are you going to bring it up? Is somebody else going to bring it up? Are we going to talk about it or not? I don't know. Let's find out!\n\nThe single hardest part of \"Survivor\" for me is being away from home. That has never changed.\n\nMy wife and I will attempt to have date nights where we agree to watch an episode of whatever show we're watching from across the world. I'll put it on my iPad, she'll put it on her iPad, and then we'll say 3, 2, 1, and hit play. So that's kind of a fun way for us to bond.\n\nWe like a good crime drama — a little bit of love and lust and blood and guts and \"Who did it?\" and \"Oh, I can't believe it was him!\" We just finished \"The Beast Within,\" and now we're going back to watch \"The Night Manager.\"\n\nIf I have 15 minutes to myself, my go-to is almost always watching a police interrogation on YouTube. They're fascinating if you like that kind of thing. You are watching a human walk into a room, wondering, \"How much do these detectives know?\" In most cases, the detective knows a lot more than you think, but they want to see what you're willing to share.\n\nThen you watch a great detective or a team of detectives slowly build this box, and the box gets smaller and smaller, and the guilty person starts to realize, \"I'm never going home. They know what I did.\" I love those subtle shifts in power dynamics, watching how people respond and what tells they have.\n\nWhen it comes to reading books, I tend to listen to them more right now. My wife just turned me on to a book by Ram Dass, which is really interesting. It could be Ram Dass, Joseph Campbell, Alan Watts — I love that philosophical side of listening to philosophers talk about being human.\n\nI'm also really into longevity, and the role technology is playing in where our lives might be heading. I'm really interested in Ray Kurzweil, who predicted the singularity 30 years ago, and he was right on the money. That kind of stuff fascinates me because obviously I'm too dumb to talk about it. But it's a paradigm shift in our culture, and it's happening in real time.\n\nSo if I really have free time, I'm distracting myself with something not related to \"Survivor. \" And then I'll fall asleep pretty early and get back up with the sun.\n\n\"Survivor 50\" airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET, starting February 25 on CBS and Paramount+.",

    "description": "Trump revealed details of the US raid into Venezuela while awarding the Medal of Honor to an Army pilot.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump shared vivid details Tuesday night of the firefight that erupted as an American helicopter reached Nicolás Maduro's compound during the US raid into Venezuela last month.\n\nAs the Chinook helicopter carrying elite US ground troops and piloted by Chief Warrant Officer 5 Eric Slover approached what the president had previously described as a fortress, \"enemy machine guns fired from every angle,\" Trump said during his State of the Union Address.\n\n\"Eric was hit very badly in the leg and hip,\" the president said as he awarded the military's top valor award, the Congressional Medal of Honor, to Slover.\n\nImmediately following the January 3 raid to capture the then-president of Venezuela, Trump said that a helicopter got hit \"pretty hard\" and that \"a couple of guys were hit.\" Official details of the injuries were limited. His speech on Tuesday shed new light on what happened that night.\n\nAfter numerous American warplanes, including advanced stealth fighters, suppressed Venezuela's air defense network, helicopters carrying ground troops moved in, approaching Maduro's fortified compound.\n\nSlover's helicopter encountered \"two machine gunners who escaped the wrath of the previous planes,\" Trump said. As the bullets hit the aircraft, Slover \"absorbed four agonizing shots, shredding his leg into numerous pieces,\" he continued. \"He was gushing blood.\"\n\nHelicopter pilots rely on both a control stick and floor pedals for maneuvering. Most helicopters have one main rotor and a small tail rotor to keep them from spinning, but a Chinook has two large rotors that balance each other.\n\nDespite his serious wounds, Slover managed to maneuver his helicopter into position so that onboard gunners could \"take care of business\" and \"eliminate the threat,\" the president said, crediting Slover with \"saving the lives of his fellow warriors from what could have been a catastrophic crash, deep in enemy territory.\"\n\nAfter landing, Slover told his co-pilot, who was also wounded but not as gravely, to \"take over,\" saying, \"I'm about ready to pass out.\" A total of seven US troops were injured during the raid.\n\nDuring his State of the Union address, Trump also presented a second Medal of Honor to centenarian US Navy pilot E. Royce Williams, a veteran of World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.\n\nThree years ago, Williams was awarded the Navy Cross for \"extraordinary heroism\" in a Korean War air battle in which he was outgunned and outmatched in his F9F Panther by Soviet MiG-15 fighters but still managed to shoot down four of them.\n\nThe 1952 dogfight was classified for decades.\n\nThe Congressional Medal of Honor is usually awarded in solemn, less politically charged ceremonies at the White House. The award can take years, or even decades, as was the case for Williams, to be bestowed. It requires eyewitness accounts and has strict criteria. Other valor awards, such as the Navy Cross or Silver Star, can occasionally be upgraded to a Medal of Honor, a notoriously lengthy process.\n\nThe top award is bestowed upon troops engaged against an enemy of the US or an \"opposing foreign force,\" according to the military's awards manual.\n\nThat the medal was awarded during the State of the Union elicited reactions from some veterans online who felt that the timing dampened the gravity of the award's significance.\n\nDuring the event, Trump reiterated his previously stated desire to receive the Medal of Honor.\n\n\"I've always wanted the Congressional Medal of Honor, but I was informed, I'm not allowed to give it to myself,\" Trump told the crowd. \"I wouldn't know why I'd be taking it, but if they ever open up that law, I will be there with you someday.\"",

    "fullText": "Fears of a software apocalypse could drag the market into another sharp decline.\n\nThat's according to Wall Street forecasters who say they're eyeing an increased risk of another sharp pullback in US stocks amid the chaos that's hammered software and the broader tech sector in recent weeks. They say a handful of worrying signals are flashing in the market, pointing to indicators like waning stock momentum and increased options activity.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs analysts said they estimate that the risk of another drawdown has increased from 23% to 28%, after accounting for recent volatility and slowing momentum in US equities.\n\nThe bank pointed in particular to the drop in equity momentum, a measure of how quickly stocks are rising or falling. Though the S&P 500 is up over the last six months, the index's momentum has fallen around 4.3% — a key threshold that has historically signaled \"larger drawdowns\" are on the way, analysts wrote.\n\nWhen the index's momentum has dropped more than 4.3%, the index has fallen an average 10% over the following 12 months, the bank said, citing its analysis of stock moves since 1950.\n\n\"The unwind over the past 6 months is currently on the cusp of this level,\" analysts wrote.\n\nTechnical analysts at Piper Sandler also flagged a potential warning sign in its measures of the market's momentum.\n\n\"Our short-term momentum oscillators signal a fatigued market setting up for a pullback within its uptrend. Be vigilant about chasing breakouts and wait for confirmed support before adding to positions,\" the firm said in a client note on Wednesday.\n\nTorsten Slok, the chief economist at Apollo, said he also saw the potential for sharp swings in the S&P 500. In a note on Wednesday, he pointed to the fact that more companies in the benchmark index are trading on their own fundamentals rather than moving as a group. More stocks are also moving more than 10% in a single day.\n\nMeanwhile, options trading in the S&P 500 looks \"extremely elevated,\" suggesting \"heavy retail speculation and leverage-like exposure\" among investors, he added.\n\n\"Larger idiosyncratic moves and outsized options participation leave the market structure more fragile and more vulnerable to an abrupt, outsized move,\" Slok said.",

    "description": "My Army boyfriend and I lived 2,800 miles apart, so we chose a 100% legal virtual wedding just nine months into dating.",
    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Marissa Radford, 22, an admissions representative at a trade school in Modesto, California. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always been somewhat of a risk taker, so my friends didn't think it was that unusual for me to have a whirlwind romance.\n\nI knew I wanted to marry my boyfriend, Damien, 23, almost as soon as we started dating. And, just seven months into our relationship, we exchanged vows in a very unconventional way.\n\nWe like to call it a \"virtual elopement.\" Not only did we do it on the spur of the moment, but it also took place online.\n\nDamien and I officially \"met\" through mutual friends at a country music concert in May of 2022. However, we went to the same school in Modesto, California, without really knowing each other.\n\nIt turned out we even took the same bus when I was a junior, and he was a senior. We only made the connection after we got talking at the event.\n\nIt was funny because Damien said he'd admired me from afar, but had never felt able to approach me.\n\nHe was in the Army when we began our relationship, based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, about 2,800 miles from Modesto and a 40-hour drive door-to-door.\n\nBut we kept things going through constant texting and video calling. Unfortunately, Damien didn't get much leave, so we didn't spend much time together face-to-face.\n\nThen, in January 2023, we began seriously discussing our future. We knew we wanted to live together and get married. Why wait?\n\nDamien wasn't due for leave anytime soon, so I researched our options online. I found Virtual Marriage, a company that conducts 100% legal marriages online. They're recognized in all 50 states.\n\nThe service is popular with military families and other couples in long-distance relationships, and it made perfect sense for us.\n\nWe booked the ceremony for February 14, 2023, because it was such a romantic way to celebrate Valentine's Day. We invited a small number of friends who joined the call.\n\nDamien looked handsome in his dress uniform, and I wore a white top to fit the occasion. I held a bouquet of flowers.\n\nThe whole thing was quirky, fun, and felt like a proper elopement. We exchanged vows, and the officiant pronounced us man and wife.\n\nAfterward, we blew kisses at each other and put on our rings on the count of three.\n\nI moved to Fort Bragg two months later, driving across the country with my stuff in a U-Haul truck. We rented a house near the barracks.\n\nOur daughter, Acelynn, was born in September 2024, and Damien left the Army when his four-year contract ended that Christmas. We've since moved back to Modesto, where Damien now works for an HVAC company.\n\nWe're planning a vow renewal and throwing a big party to celebrate, probably on our fifth wedding anniversary. In the meantime, it'll be great to share our unconventional wedding video with Acelynn.",

    "fullText": "Investors have arrived at the final boss of this season's tech earnings.\n\nNvidia's results come at a particularly sensitive time for the market, with investors no longer blindly rewarding every company that touches AI, instead electing to divide the landscape into distinct winners and losers.\n\nAnalysts ahead of the fourth-quarter call say they'll be listening for comments from CEO Jensen Huang on the appetite for high-end AI chips and how the company is ramping production of its Rubin platform.\n\nNvidia stock is up roughly 3% so far in 2026.\n\nThe company will report earnings after the 4 p.m. ET closing bell, with the analyst call scheduled to start around 5 p.m. ET.\n\nOne big question as Nvidia reports earnings: What's next on the China front?\n\nThe Trump administration initially signaled it would allow sales of less advanced Nvidia Blackwell GPUs in China, but later reversed course amid concerns they could be used to further Beijing's military capabilities. In December, it decided to allow Chinese firms to buy the second most advanced AI chips, though these shipments have stalled.\n\nOne big question as Nvidia reports earnings: What's next on the China front?\n\nThe Trump administration initially signaled it would allow sales of less advanced Nvidia Blackwell GPUs in China, but later reversed course amid concerns they could be used to further Beijing's military capabilities. In December, it decided to allow Chinese firms to buy the second most advanced AI chips, though these shipments have stalled.\n\nA new twist came earlier this week, when Reuters reported that Chinese AI lab DeepSeek had trained its newest model on Nvidia's top-tier Blackwell chips at a data center, likely in Inner Mongolia. While Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has continued to advocate for expanded access to the Chinese market, the latest development underscores how China remains one of Nvidia's biggest geopolitical flashpoints heading into earnings.\n\nNvidia has led the AI boom thanks to demand for its GPUs to train large language models. But, as my colleague Ali Barr recently pointed out, the game is changing from training models to actually running them — a task known as inference.\n\nIn December, Nvidia acquired Groq, an inference-focused chipmaker, sending a big signal that it's shifting with the times. However, there's still an opportunity for rivals to take advantage of this transition. Investors will want reassurance that Nvidia's crown isn't about to slip as inference takes off.\n\nEven if Nvidia beats earnings estimates, the chipmaker's numbers are more likely to be \"heavily scrutinized\" by investors after a report from Citrini Research went viral earlier in the week, according to Hardika Singh, an economic strategist at Fundstrat Research.\n\nIn the report, written as a hypothetical look back from 2028, the research firm outlined a scenario in which the AI boom leads to a white-collar recession and a stock market crash sometime in the next two years.\n\nEven if Nvidia beats earnings estimates, the chipmaker's numbers are more likely to be \"heavily scrutinized\" by investors after a report from Citrini Research went viral earlier in the week, according to Hardika Singh, an economic strategist at Fundstrat Research.\n\nIn the report, written as a hypothetical look back from 2028, the research firm outlined a scenario in which the AI boom leads to a white-collar recession and a stock market crash sometime in the next two years.\n\n\"I don't expect too many fireworks this time around,\" Singh wrote in a client note, pointing to Nvidia's historical performance after reporting earnings. \"Investors are already on edge about the AI trade, given how a simple hypothetical scenario in a Substack article caused a selloff in shares of everything from DoorDash to Mastercard.\"\n\n\"The timing particularly sucks for Nvidia, which just can't seem to catch a break,\" she added.\n\nThe bar is high for Nvidia, even more so this quarter as investors rethink parts of the AI trade. Scrutiny will be on not just a solid earnings beat but also on guidance for the current quarter and beyond.\n\n\"Though AI spending shows little sign of easing, Nvidia and fellow chip firms face higher bandwidth memory costs amid sector shortages, and this could affect projected margin growth,\" oe Mazzola, the head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, said\n\nThe bar is high for Nvidia, even more so this quarter as investors rethink parts of the AI trade.

    "fullText": "The AI trade has had a rocky start to 2026, but Goldman Sachs says mega-cap tech stocks that have been hurt by the market rotation could see a turnaround later in the year.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks went from carrying the AI trade to lagging the S&P 500. Goldman expects AI gains to continue broadening from the mega-cap names, but the analysts outline three catalysts that could revive Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet's market leadership in the second half of 2026.\n\n\"Hyperscaler return dispersion should continue in the near-term, but we see three catalysts for a potential inflection later this year,\" the analysts said.\n\nHere are three drivers of a potential turnaround for mega-cap laggards that Goldman is eyeing this year.\n\nCompanies reporting increasing revenue tied to AI will ease concerns about overspending.\n\n\"An acceleration in AI-related revenues would support investor belief in the eventual return on ongoing investment spending and the long-term earnings potential of the hyperscalers,\" the analysts said.\n\nThey added that AI-related revenue growth would offer investors visibility into the pathway to AI monetization, showing that colossal spending is justified.\n\nGoldman says that the latest round of Big Tech earnings demonstrates this idea. All hyperscalers lifted their capital expenditure outlooks, but share prices didn't have a uniform reaction.\n\nMicrosoft fell on weak cloud growth and Amazon dropped on its inline sales guide, while Meta popped on its strong revenue outlook and robust revenue in its ad business.\n\nGoldman expects AI capex growth to peak in 2026 and then decelerate, allowing investors to better assess companies' earnings potential.\n\nHyperscaler spending is on pace to make up 92% of cash flows from operations, above the rate seen in the dot com bubble.\n\n\"A deceleration in capex growth would offer line of sight to a trough in free cash flows, which would help investors value these companies on an earnings basis again,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe stock market has seen a rotation from tech stocks into cyclical names, with recent fears about AI transforming the global economy have dethroning legacy tech leaders.\n\n\"A shift in the macroeconomic backdrop from accelerating growth to decelerating growth should push investors to look for opportunities among secular growth stocks,\" the analysts said.\n\nGoldman economists expect the US economy to grow in the first half of the year, supporting cyclical stocks that generally aren't tied to AI.

    "description": "Anthropic said it will no longer \"pause the scaling and/or delay the deployment of new models\" when the updates would outpace its own safety measures.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic is no longer daring to be quite so different.\n\nThe AI startup founded by former OpenAI employees, laser-focused on the proper development of the technology, is weakening its foundational safety principle.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Anthropic said that amid heightened competition and a lack of government regulation, it will no longer abide by its commitment \"to pause the scaling and/or delay the deployment of new models\" when such advancements would have outpaced its own safety measures.\n\nThe new policy means Anthropic is far less constrained by safety concerns at a moment when its flagship chatbot, Claude, is upending financial markets and sparking concerns about the death of software.\n\nAs part of the changes, Anthropic now has separate safety recommendations, called its Responsible Scaling Policy, for itself and the AI industry as a whole. The policy was loosely modeled after the US government's biosafety level (BSL) standards\n\nAnthropic's chief science officer, Jared Kaplan, told Time Magazine that the responsible scaling policy was not in keeping with the current state of the AI race.\n\n\"We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models,\" Kaplan told Time. \"We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments … if competitors are blazing ahead.\"\n\nThe new policy still includes a commitment to delay the development or release of \"a highly capable\" AI model, but only in more limited circumstances.\n\nIn a lengthy blog post, Anthropic cited \"an anti-regulatory political climate\" as part of the reason for its decision. The company and its CEO, Dario Amodei, have pushed for AI regulations with some success on the state level, but without any major steps at the federal level.\n\n\"We remain convinced that effective government engagement on AI safety is both necessary and achievable, and we aim to continue advancing a conversation grounded in evidence, national security interests, economic competitiveness, and public trust,\" the company wrote. \"But this is proving to be a long-term project—not something that is happening organically as AI becomes more capable or crosses certain thresholds.\"\n\nThe company said the scaling policy was always intended to be \"a living document,\" which was outlined in the first version in 2023. That said, Amodei has previously said the safety policy was meant to mitigate the risks AI could unleash — even quoting Uncle Ben's famous admonition to Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man.\n\n\"The power of the models and their ability to solve all these problems in biology, neuroscience, economic development, governance, and peace, large parts of the economy, those come with risks as well, right?\" Amodei told podcaster Lex Fridman in November 2024. \"With great power comes great responsibility.\"\n\nAnthropic said another reason for changing the standards is that higher theoretical levels of risk, ASL-4 and beyond, in their framework, cannot be contained by any one company alone. (In the biosecurity world, BSL-4 refers to the highest level of protection that an extremely small number of labs implement to handle pathogens like the Ebola virus.)\n\nAmodei has repeatedly said his company's commitment to safety is evident in one of its first major decisions: holding back on releasing Claude in the summer of 2022.\n\nLooking back on the move, Amodei has said that Anthropic was worried that it could not develop safeguards quickly enough for the public release of a breakthrough technology. OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, kick-starting the AI race. Months later, Anthropic finally released Claude.\n\n\"Now, that was very commercially expensive,\" Amodei said during a recent interview with billionaire and investor Nikhil Kamath. \"We probably seeded the lead on consumer AI because of that.\"\n\nThe policy change also comes as Anthropic faces pressure from the Pentagon over the redlines the startup has for the use of its AI models. Amodei met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday to discuss the issue. Anthropic faces a Friday deadline, or Hegseth could reportedly seek to invoke powers to force the company to back down.\n\nOne of Claude's previous training documents is internally referred to as the \"Soul doc,\" an example of rhetoric that would be out of place at most other AI companies.\n\nKamath pressed Amodei on how he responds to critics who say Anthropic is just pushing regulation to stop the growth of future competitors. Amodei said the 2022 decision was an example of how is company backs up its talk on safety. He also pointed to advocating for US export controls on advanced chips to China, a position that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has criticized.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks we benefit from being the only ones to do that, it's really hard to come up with a picture where that's the case,\" Amodei said. \"You look at any one of these and, 'okay, fine,' but you put enough of them together, and I don't know, I ask you to judge us by our actions.\"",

    "title": "Watch Out for This Phone Delivery Scam",
    "description": "No, carriers won't tell you to return your phone.",
    "fullText": "If you order a new smartphone to be delivered to your home, you may be a target for scammers. Fraudsters are impersonating representatives from mobile carriers, calling customers and claiming that they've been sent the wrong device and need to return it.\n\nObviously, if you follow through, scammers get to keep your phone—they may either to sell it or activate it using your information to perpetrate identity fraud.\n\nScams centered on stealing high-value tech aren't anything new. In addition to regular porch pirating, thieves have been known to knock on doors, posing as couriers or company representatives attempting to recover a \"wrongly delivered\" item. Fraudsters have also used fake Find My alerts to gain access to lost or stolen iPhones.\n\nAs an editor at ZDNET experienced, the scam begins shortly after your new phone is delivered. You may receive a call from a spoofed number, and someone claiming to represent your carrier will have specific information like your name, address, and device model. They'll tell you that there's been a mix-up and you need to send your phone back so you can receive a replacement. They may give you instructions to scan a QR code, print a label, and take the package to a shipping drop-off point. In some cases, targets have been promised gift cards for the inconvenience.\n\nIf you hesitate, scammers may employ a number of pressure tactics to get you to act. They'll tell you that delaying the return could cause issues with your device activation, billing, or warranty. They may continue to call with threats.\n\nLike many scams, this one relies on social engineering: it manipulates emotions and instincts to get you to act against your best interest. Fraudsters impersonate a trusted brand and use detailed information about you to make their story more believable. They use timing to their advantage and promote a sense of urgency.\n\nThe phone return scam also has similarities to the brushing scam, in which victims receive a package containing merchandise they didn't order so that scammers can write a verified review or boost sales numbers or collect personally identifiable information once you scan a QR code (an added component known as quishing) to learn more about the item.\n\nThe solution here is to simply hang up. If you are concerned about your account or device, call your carrier directly (use the customer service number from a previous bill or go through the official app) and confirm the mix-up. Don't engage with QR codes or any instructions provided on unsolicited calls.\n\nIt may be alarming that a scammer has specific details about your order and calls right after your new phone is delivered. Unfortunately, a lot of your personal information is out in the open and available to bad actors, whether as the result of a data breach or some other form of compromise (such as malware that can read notifications). This is a good reason to keep an eye out for other indicators of identity theft and act quickly if you find anything suspicious.",

    "title": "Google Just Announced Three New Gemini Upgrades for Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10",
    "description": "Android AI is getting smarter, but you currently need a Pixel 10 or Galaxy S26 for these upgrades.",
    "fullText": "To coincide with the Samsung Galaxy S26 launch, Google announced three Gemini-related upgrades for Android, coming first to both the Galaxy S26 series and the Google Pixel 10 range. In fact, one of these new features seems like a significant step forward for AI on smartphones: the ability for Gemini to handle multi-step tasks on an Android phone. The examples Google gives are booking a ride through Uber or reordering a meal on DoorDash, where the AI takes care of everything in the background, leaving you free to worry about, well, whether it's going to work.\n\n\"When you're working on a repetitive daily task, it's easy to daydream about handing it off to someone else,\" explains Google in the announcement blog post. \"Now, we're showing an early preview of what's possible.\" Understandably, this has a \"beta\" label as well as an \"early preview\" label attached, and it's initially only going to be available on Galaxy S26 phones and Pixel 10 phones (the Pixel 10a misses out). It'll also be limited to the U.S. and South Korea to begin with.\n\nAs per Google, the process will be tightly controlled: Automations begin with your voice command and end as soon as the task is finished. Live notifications will keep you updated throughout, and you can jump in and take manual control at any time. What's more, the app is run in a \"secure, virtual window\" on your phone, with restricted app access.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to see how well this works. If it works well, this feels like a notable moment in getting AI to actually do mobile tasks for us. It's not clear if Google needs third-party app permission for this, but for now the feature will be available \"for select apps\" in the food, grocery, and rideshare categories.\n\nNext, Google is upgrading Circle to Search on Android, the feature that lets you circle anything on screen and run a search from it. Circle to Search can do everything from find you a lamp online to warn you about a phishing scam.\n\nNow, Circle to Search will be able to search multiple elements on screen at once. It might be different pieces of furniture in a room, or different items of clothing in an outfit. You don't actually make the selections yourself: You just circle the relevant area (or the entire screen), and Gemini picks out the various constituent parts.\n\n\"We know that sometimes you aren't just looking for a single thing on your screen—you're looking for the whole thing,\" says Google. \"Whether you're curating a mood board, building an entire outfit or just satisfying your multi-layered curiosity...Circle to Search is getting a whole lot more helpful.\"\n\nGoogle is also embedding the ability to virtually try on clothes from your phone in the Circle to Search flow. It's similar to the Gemini multi-step process above, with the AI taking on several sequential tasks to (in theory) be even more useful—technically, Google calls it a query fan-out technique. Again, this will be exclusive to Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 phones, with no word yet on this potentially expanding to other handsets.\n\nFinally, the last upgrade is more of a wider roll out than a new feature. The Scam Detection AI that Android uses to detect if you're being scammed in calls in real time is coming to the Galaxy S26 series for users in the U.S. It's already offered on multiple Pixel models in the U.S., the UK, Australia, Canada, India, and Ireland. The same technology is also currently available in Google Messages to catch text-based scams, and Google says it's \"enhancing\" how this works to recognize more varied scams, starting with Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 devices. The new and improved tech will use on-device models to better spot techniques used by scammers.",

    "title": "The New Galaxy S26 Ultra S Pen Still Doesn’t Have Bluetooth",
    "description": "The Galaxy S24 Ultra remains the most recent Samsung phone to have an S Pen with Bluetooth.",
    "fullText": "Samsung's Galaxy S26 lineup is here, and in most ways, it's an upgrade. There are new features like the privacy display, alongside more expected upgrades to the chipset, battery life (for the base model), and charging speed (for the Ultra). But one key part of the S26 ecosystem remains a downgrade from even the Galaxy S24's: Samsung removed Bluetooth from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen last year, and unfortunately, it's not back for the S26 Ultra.\n\nIt's a hit to fans of the S Pen's former wireless control features, which debuted on the Galaxy Note 10 in 2019 and allowed the S Pen to do things like take a photo or switch between camera modes from afar. Essentially, it was a built-in remote control for your phone, so you wouldn't need to fuss with camera timers or PowerPoint remotes anymore. Users were clear that they didn't like it being removed from the S25 Ultra, but it seems like that wasn't enough to keep Samsung from leaving the feature in the past.\n\nWith the S26 Ultra's announcement, the last glimmer of hope that Bluetooth on the S Pen might make a triumphant return seems pretty dead. Samsung's been quiet about it this time around, but the company did offer some explanation for why the feature was removed back when the S25 Ultra was revealed.\n\nIn a statement to Android Police, Samsung blamed the feature's discontinuation on low user adoption, saying \"Bluetooth Low Energy is not supported on the Galaxy S25 Ultra as Samsung found that S Pen usage for BLE-enabled features was very low.\" However, the company also took the opportunity to plug products that still offered some of the features cut from the S Pen, adding that \"Galaxy users are utilizing gesture controls on the Galaxy Ring and Galaxy Watch for hands-free photo capture instead.\"\n\nWhile it's heartening that Samsung hasn't given up on remote control for its phones entirely, it should be noted that the current generation Galaxy Watch starts at $350, while the Galaxy Ring is $400. These aren't exactly replacements for an accessory that comes with your phone.\n\nBluetooth on the S Pen was also a bit more versatile than gesture controls on the Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Ring. While the S Pen was useful for photo capture, its full list of Bluetooth features included:\n\nCapturing photos and adjusting camera modes from afar.\n\nMoving to the next photo in the Samsung Gallery app.\n\nMoving forward and back in the Samsung Internet browser with the function button, and using gestures to navigate the page.\n\nNavigating around the Samsung Notes app and selecting pens from afar.\n\nMoving between slides in PowerPoint.\n\nControlling audio and media playback.\n\nUsing Air Actions, which functioned like gesture controls for activating specific, sometimes customizable phone features.\n\nThe most recent phone to have Bluetooth included in the S Pen is Samsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra, and if you're a diehard Bluetooth S Pen user, I've got good news for you. The Galaxy S24 line was Samsung's first to promise seven years of updates, meaning the Galaxy S24 Ultra will get official support straight from Samsung until 2031. That leaves you plenty of time until you'll need to upgrade, so you can stubbornly stick to your handset for at least a little while longer. And despite being a few years old, the S24 Ultra is still plenty powerful, with the same display resolution and amount of RAM as the S26 Ultra, a still competitive Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, and a 200MP main rear camera lens. Unless you absolutely need the most cutting edge technology possible, that's a great setup, and can run even demanding apps like Genshin Impact on high settings without issue.\n\nNow that we're two generations past the S24 Ultra, it seems unlikely that Bluetooth is going to leave Samsung's graveyard. But if you have an older device, you won't have to mourn for at least a little while longer.",

    "title": "Samsung Just Announced the Galaxy S26 Series",
    "description": "The latest Galaxy phones are a slight upgrade from the S25 series with some new AI features mixed in.",
    "fullText": "The newest Galaxy series is officially here. Samsung announced its latest batch of flagship phones During its big Unpacked 2026 event. The company had announced as much ahead of the presentation but was silent on the name, though few will be surprised to learn this year's phones are the Galaxy S26 series—specifically, the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ and Galaxy S26 Ultra. While the new devices look similar to last year's models, there are some new features and changes (including ones exclusive to the S26 Ultra) that may make them worth upgrading.\n\nSince Samsung is all-in on AI, it's only fitting there are a couple of new Galaxy AI features making their debut on the Galaxy S26 series. First is the \"Now Nudge,\" Samsung's answer to the Pixel 10's Magic Cue feature. Now Nudge uses AI to understand the context of what's currently on your screen and prompts users with helpful information, such relevant photos, calendar availability and more.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 series supports switching between three AI assistants at once. You can access Google Gemini and Bixby, of course, but users will now be able to use Perplexity as well. This includes hands-free voice commands (e.g. \"Hey Plex.\") Galaxy S26 users can utilize Perplexity to get info, manage tasks, or even navigate through their device using natural voice or text prompts.\n\nSamsung is also upgrading Circle to Search with version 3.0. Now, users can circle multiple items within an image, such as a whole outfit, and Galaxy AI can identify and itemize each item at once. Then, there's Notification Intelligence, where the AI will prioritize your most important messages and notifications, such as conversations with humans, above promotional or subscription notifications. The higher priority notifications will appear higher in your incoming notifications list.\n\nOne of the S26 Ultra's exclusive features is Privacy Display, which allows users to make their screen only visible when viewing straight on, as if you're using a privacy screen protectors. Privacy Display can be enabled all the time or during certain conditions, like using certain apps or when entering a passcode or password.\n\nAll models in the Galaxy S26 series are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy chip, a slightly overclocked version of the SoC exclusive to Samsung phones. Compared to last year's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the 8 Elite Gen 5 brings a 20% performance boost and 35% CPU power efficiency, thanks to the 3 nanometer manufacturing process. The new Adreno GPU in the 8 Elite Gen 5 should also improve graphics performance by 23%.\n\nLike the Galaxy S25 series, all three Galaxy S26 models feature a Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which supports an adaptive refresh rate of 1-120Hz. Storage options include 256GB and 512GB on the S26 and S26+, while the S26 Ultra comes in an optional 1TB variant as well. All three come with 12GB of RAM, but the 1TB S26 Ultra comes with 16GB of RAM. Screen sizes have stayed relatively the same apart from the base S26, which has gone up to 6.3 inches:\n\nGalaxy S26: 6.3-inch display (2340 x 1080)\n\nGalaxy S26+: 6.7-inch display (3120 x 1440)\n\nGalaxy S26 Ultra: 6.9-inch display (3120 x 1440)\n\nThe base model S26 comes with a 4,300 mAh battery, up from the 4,000 mAh battery on the S25, while the S26+ stays with a 4,900 mAh battery and the S26 Ultra continues with a 5,000 mAh battery. The S26 supports 25W wired and 15W wireless charging, while the S26+ supports 45W wired and 20W wireless charging. The S26 Ultra, however, has the fastest speeds of all, with 60W wired and 25W wireless charging. Despite those speeds, the Galaxy S26 series does not support Qi2 with the built-in magnetic array like Pixelsnap on the Pixel 10 series. That being said, Samsung will happily sell you their official cases with magnets built-in and will offer a magnetic charging puck and magnet battery pack.\n\nAs far as the cameras go, Samsung isn't changing much with the Galaxy S26 series. The S26 and S26+ have the same 12MP ultra-wide, 50MP wide, and 10MP telephoto lenses as the S25 and S25+. The Galaxy S26 Ultra gets a slight upgrade, at least to the 200MP wide lens, which now comes with a new f/1.4 aperture. It carries over the 50MP ultra-wide and two telephoto lenses, 10MP (3x) and 50MP (5x), of the S25 Ultra. The 12MP selfie camera on all three models also hasn't changed from the S25 series. Thanks to the wider aperture on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, you can shoot what Samsung calls Nightography Video. It allows users to capture more detail in low light environments, to complement Samsung's Nightography photo mode.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 series is available for pre-order starting today. The phones will be available in a number of colors including, Cobalt Violet, Sky Blue and Black.",

    "description": "The Republic of Ireland's home Nations League fixture against Israel on 4 October will be played at Dublin's Aviva Stadium, says the the Football Association of Ireland.",
    "fullText": "The Republic of Ireland's home Nations League fixture against Israel on 4 October will be played at Dublin's Aviva Stadium, the Football Association of Ireland has confirmed.\n\nAfter the sides were drawn together earlier this month, there were reports, external that the game would be held at a neutral venue because of security concerns after Belgium's home game with Israel in September 2024 was moved to Debrecen, Hungary.\n\nHowever, according to the FAI, Gardaí (Irish police) have advised that the game can be \"staged safely at the Aviva Stadium\".\n\nThe teams are also scheduled to face each other in a return fixture on 27 September. The Israeli FA has said it hopes to host the Republic of Ireland in Tel Aviv, but a venue is yet to be confirmed.\n\nIn a letter to the association's general assembly, FAI president Paul Cooke said a decision to fulfil the home and away games and host the home match at the Dublin venue was made \"after taking legal advice, engaging with key stakeholders and reflecting on our constitutional obligations\".\n\n\"We understand that this decision will be difficult for many members and supporters. It has not been taken lightly,\" said Cooke.\n\n\"We intend to use the home fixture as an opportunity to provide tangible support for humanitarian efforts assisting civilians affected by the conflict. Further details will be outlined closer to the match.\"\n\nByrne and Drogheda dispute resignation claims over Israel comments\n\nRepublic of Ireland will fulfil Israel games - FAI\n\nIn November 2025, the FAI voted to submit a motion urging Uefa to ban Israel from its club and international competitions.\n\nThe motion, which was overwhelmingly passed, called on European football's governing body to exclude Israel for \"violating two independent provisions of the Uefa statutes\".\n\nThe \"violations\" cited were the \"organisation of clubs in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank without the consent of the Palestinian Football Association\" and a \"failure to implement and enforce an effective anti-racism policy\".\n\nFollowing the Nations League draw, the FAI faced calls to boycott the games, including from former Republic of Ireland boss Brian Kerr.\n\n\"We have made our views known directly to Uefa, including following the motion overwhelmingly approved by members at last November's extraordinary general meeting, and we have continued to raise those concerns over a sustained period,\" added Cooke.\n\n\"However, having been drawn to play these fixtures, we are required to do so.\"\n\nThe Republic of Ireland will also face Austria and Kosovo in League B3.\n\nFollowing the Nations League draw on 12 February, the FAI indicated it would fulfil both fixtures because of the potential for disqualification.\n\nIn a statement following the draw, the FAI said it had consulted with Uefa and that sanctions for not fulfilling a fixture could lead to disqualification from the Nations League.\n\nIn September, there were reports Uefa may hold a vote on whether to suspend Israel from club and international competition.\n\nHowever, such a move never materialised and any prospect of that happening receded after the announcement of the Israel-Hamas peace plan for Gaza in October.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have been fined £325,000 and West Ham £300,000 over a \"mass confrontation\" between players during their Premier League game in January.\n\nThe incident at Stamford Bridge started when Chelsea forward Joao Pedro reacted to West Ham winger Adama Traore's shove on Blues defender Marc Cucurella in added time.\n\nBoth sets of players came together in ugly scenes and, following a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) check, Hammers defender Jean-Clair Todibo was shown a straight red card by referee Anthony Taylor for grabbing Joao Pedro by the neck.\n\n\"It was alleged that Chelsea FC failed to ensure its players didn't behave in an improper and/or provocative way around the 95th minute,\" said an Football Association statement., external\n\n\"It was also alleged that West Ham United FC failed to ensure its players didn't behave in an improper and/or provocative and/or violent way at this time.\n\n\"Both clubs subsequently admitted the charges against them.\"\n\nIn imposing the fines, an independent regulatory commission took the fact that both clubs had committed previous breaches of FA Rule E20.1 into account.\n\nThe rule states that there should be no behaviour that is \"improper, offensive, violent, threatening, abusive, indecent, insulting or provocative\".\n\nChelsea hit back from two goals down to beat West Ham\n\nChelsea were 2-0 down in the match but went on to win 3-2 thanks to Enzo Fernandez's injury-time goal, which came before the confrontation.\n\nIn its written reasons, the independent regulatory commission stated \"this was a serious incident\" involving a number of Chelsea's players.\n\nIt added: \"It was not accepted that Mr Cucurella was wholly without fault. He was aware of his actions after conceding the corner kick and returning to his feet.\n\n\"He sought to invite a reaction from Mr Traore. That is not to justify Mr Traore's disproportionate reaction from which the mass confrontation ensued.\n\n\"Furthermore, the commission noted that three of the Chelsea players were in some way seeking to incite the crowd during and towards the end of the incident.\n\n\"There is no justification for this behaviour, irrespective of what had happened during the course of the game or within the mass confrontation itself. It was accepted that the club had admitted the charge and was contrite.\"\n\nThe commission said both clubs \"contributed to the incident\" and that Traore's \"disproportionate reaction to Mr Cucurella's movement as he returned to his feet, was the catalyst for what occurred\".\n\nIt also stated: \"It was accepted that there was no violent conduct from any other West Ham United players beyond the behaviour of Mr Todibo.\n\n\"However, a large number of West Ham United players did behave in an improper and provocative manner and contributed to what was a serious, unsightly incident.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

But then - wilderness.\n\nThis is how Zimbabwe battled back to impress again on the biggest stage.\n\nAt the 2003 World Cup - hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya - Flower and Olonga wore black armbands in response to the 'death of democracy' under the country's leader Robert Mugabe. Both men subsequently fled the country.\n\nA year later, 14 senior players resigned in protest at political interference and selection quotas. By 2006, massive defeats and off-field struggles led to Zimbabwe voluntarily suspending its own Test status.\n\nFor 15 years, the side languished with only occasional moments to remind dejected supporters of previous successes. A return to Test cricket in 2011 saw a win over Bangladesh, but national governing body Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) accumulated debts reportedly as high as $27m (£20m at current conversion rate).\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2023, former all-rounder Sean Williams reflected on the darker days.\n\n\"There were more office members employed than players,\" he said. \"It was a nightmare.\n\n\"People knew how much money Zimbabwe Cricket was getting paid but nothing was happening. It looked like it was dying at that time - if not dead.\"\n\nThe nadir arguably came in 2019, when the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended ZC and barred them from qualifying for the 2021 T20 World Cup.\n\nZimbabwe's black armband protest remembered\n\n'For 20 years I felt like Zimbabwe's most hated man'\n\nHowever, under the stewardship of chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani, finances were tackled to become almost debt-free, the board operating on a shoestring budget to right a ship that had not so much been listing as sitting at the bottom of Lake Kariba.\n\nHuge sacrifices were made by staff, careful planning required to give a once-proud side the chance of recovery.\n\nFormer captain Tatenda Taibu told BBC Sport hope was never lost.\n\nHe said: \"Even when things seem to be going southward, there is a certain statement that's often said in Zimbabwe: 'I will make a plan'.\n\n\"There have been a lot of ups and downs from the 2000s, but anyone who knows Zimbabweans, you know Zimbabwe will bounce back.\"\n\nAs well as the work behind the scenes, the cricket approach became unusually old-school, with a focus on developing players in the red-ball game.\n\n\"When the new board took over, they made a conscious decision to say, 'Let's go back and play Tests - this is the only way our team's going to improve,'\" ZC managing director Givemore Makoni told the BBC last year.\n\n\"And since we started, we've seen some huge progress in terms of how the team is performing.\"\n\nThe appointment of Justin Sammons as head coach in 2024 was pivotal to a regular shift towards on-field success.\n\nSammons focused on fitness and embraced a culture of ensuring opportunities for young players, like opener Brian Bennett and fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani.\n\nBoth have starred in this T20 World Cup, helping the Chevrons finish top of Group B thanks to stunning wins over former champions Australia and Sri Lanka.\n\n\"The players must get the credit as they take to the field and execute all the various plans formulated,\" said former fast bowler and commentator Pommie Mbangwa.\n\n\"Management and coaching too should be recognised for their consistency, but there is never any doubt with regard to how hard all involved need to work in order to give themselves a chance of doing well.\"\n\nPerhaps the most significant on-field figure has been all-rounder and T20 captain Sikandar Raza.\n\nAfter moving from Pakistan to join his family in Zimbabwe in 2002, Raza put aside the disappointment of an eye condition ruining his hopes of becoming a fighter pilot and sought a career as a cricketer.\n\nThree player-of-the-match performances at the 2022 T20 World Cup, smashing 133 off 43 deliveries as his side hit a T20 international world record 344-4 against Gambia in 2024 and smacking a 54-ball hundred - Zimbabwe's fastest one-day international century - against the Netherlands in 2023 are just a few examples of his exploits.\n\n\"This is probably the first time in a long time where the fans have travelled to support,\" said Raza.\n\n\"That is because of the way we have played cricket over the last year. We have given them hope that this team is onto something and we can achieve something if we all are together.\n\n\"And that's just not the cricketers, or the changing room, or the technical staff. It is our fans. It is our media. It is the citizens of our country.\"\n\nNow approaching his 40th birthday, Raza continues to lead from the front.\n\nWhen sub-par performances meant a qualifying tournament in Kenya was required to reach this T20 World Cup, Raza's message was clear.\n\n\"I sat down with the squad and said either we feel sorry for ourselves and be ashamed or actually understand the reality,\" he said. \"It's because of us we are in this mess and it's only us who can get out of it.\"\n\nAnd he knows how proud those at home will be.\n\n\"Let's just be together and actually enjoy this because it's a huge achievement for the country,\" he added.\n\nFor those that saw the dark days, like Taibu, a moment like reaching the Super 8 stage must be treasured.\n\n\"In World Cups, Zimbabwe will always be an underdog. I'm very proud,\" he said.\n\nMbangwa added: \"It is wonderful to see the team do well on the world stage. It breeds positivity and gives so many people joy.\"\n\nAnd the future is bright, with a core of talented players, strong leadership and the prospect of an ICC event on home soil.\n\nThe men's 50-over World Cup in 2027 will be co-hosted by Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia, with matches played at a new, 10,000-seat stadium near Victoria Falls.\n\nAs to that vision of success in years to come, Mbangwa wants the country to cherish the now.\n\n\"What's important is to enjoy the present and keep doing what they're doing,\" he said.\n\nAfter coming through Group B unbeaten - a win over Oman and a washout against Ireland alongside those remarkables victories against Australia and Sri Lanka - Zimbabwe suffered a crushing 107-run defeat by West Indies in their Super 8 Group 1 opener.\n\nThey next face defending champions and co-hosts India - smarting from defeat by South Africa and in need of victory - in Chennai on Thursday.\n\nBut while the Chevrons are not favourites to progress to the semi-finals, nothing can be ruled out.\n\nAs Taibu says: \"Possibilities? They are always there where Zimbabwe is concerned.\"",

    "fullText": "Katie Taylor has confirmed she will bring the curtain down on her decorated career after a farewell fight in Dublin this summer.\n\nThe two-weight undisputed world champion has not fought since she won her trilogy fight with Amanda Serrano in New York last July.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 39-year-old Irishwoman said she remains hopeful her swansong fight will take place at Croke Park.\n\n\"I just want to fight in Dublin to end my career,\" she told RTE.\n\n\"Obviously we're still hoping for Croke Park, we're hanging on to a bit of hope that it can happen.\n\n\"If it doesn't happen there are plenty of options there. I have obviously fought in the 3Arena a couple of times, the Aviva Stadium is also there.\n\n\"Croke Park would the top of the list.\"\n\nOn her career, Taylor added: \"It has been an amazing journey, the whole lot of it, over these last 20 years.\n\n\"I have had the highs and lows. It has been an incredible, remarkable career and I always wanted to end it here in Ireland.\"\n\nThe opponent, date and venue for Taylor's final fight have not been confirmed.\n\nAugust would be a more likely date for a Croke Park bout as the iconic Dublin stadium is hosting the latter stages of the All-Ireland Hurling and Football Championships throughout July.\n\nIn September, Taylor was named 'Champion in Recess' by the World Boxing Council (WBC) after informing the sanctioning body of her plans to take some time away from the sport.\n\nLast week, Briton Sandy Ryan claimed the vacant belt with victory over Mexico's Karla Ramos Zamora in Nottingham.\n\nTaylor has a 25-1 professional record with her only defeat coming against Britain's Chantelle Cameron in Dublin in 2023.\n\nAfter avenging that loss to become a two-weight undisputed champion later that year, Taylor recorded wins over Serrano in November 2024 and July 2025 having already overcome the Puerto Rican in April 2022.\n\n\"I'm not sure who the opponent is or what the date will be,\" added Taylor, who won an Olympic lightweight gold medal in 2012 before turning pro in 2016.\n\n\"I just know I'll fight this year during the summer time and all the other details will be laid out in the coming weeks and months.\n\n\"Either way I'm in the gym for whenever and whoever it will be. I'm staying sharp and ready.\"\n\nWhen Taylor hangs up her gloves, she will do so as one of the greatest boxers of all time and, perhaps, as the greatest athlete Ireland has ever produced.\n\nTaylor has been boxing for more of her life than she hasn't, taking up the sport aged 12 and making her amateur debut in 2001.\n\nShe grew up in an Ireland battling to bring about equality for women. The Irish Constitution recognised women's role was \"in the home\" and women were barred from boxing completely.\n\nHer influence and her drive helped usher in a new era for women's rights in sports.\n\nShe fought in the first legalised women's bout aged 15 against fellow Irishwoman Alanna Nihell. She became a multiple-time world champion before winning an Olympic gold medal in 2012.\n\nTaylor revolutionised the professional game and alongside her contemporaries, smashed through the glass ceiling and brought women's boxing to the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nShe is also one of five boxers, male or female, to become undisputed champion in two weight classes in the four-belt era.\n\nTaylor has always carried herself with grace and humility, always paying tribute to the women who came before her, those who laid the path for her like her hero Deirdre Gogarty.\n\nShe has represented Ireland with dignity and excellence. But she still has one more dream – to fight at Croke Park in front of as many of her people as possible.\n\nCosts have scuppered that dream to date, but perhaps the opportunity of a fairytale ending for an Irish icon will be bring one last dream to fruition.\n\nWho could argue she doesn't deserve it?\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "The Jacksonville Jaguars will play two home games in London during the 2026 NFL season, while the Washington Commanders will host the other London game.\n\nThe announcement comes a day after the Detroit Lions were confirmed as the host team for the NFL's return to Munich next season.\n\nThe NFL's sixth regular-season game in Germany will be particularly poignant for Detroit's wide receiver Amon-Ra St Brown and his family.\n\nThe 26-year-old's mother Miriam is German and he and his two brothers speak the language fluently. They have visited Germany often and it was Miriam who broke the news to her youngest son, external that his team will play at Allianz Arena.\n\n\"It has been a dream of mine to play a game in my mother's home country,\" said Amon-Ra. \"I cannot wait to play in front of the incredible fans that I've gotten to know through my visits and football camps.\"\n\nThe dates and the opponents for the games will be confirmed during the NFL's full schedule release in May.\n\nThey will be part of a record nine international games in 2026, across four continents, seven countries and eight stadiums.\n\n\"I think that's really cool for him,\" Henry Hodgson, general manager at NFL UK and Ireland, told BBC Sport. \"I was lucky to spend some time with his older brother, Equanimeous, at their family home in Cologne. They're really proud of their German heritage.\n\n\"Reflecting back on 2019, when Efe Obada got the chance to play at Tottenham with the Carolina Panthers, it's really special for players who have that history, that heritage in a country, to be able to go there and show people, in real life, what it is that they do.\n\n\"I'm sure he will embrace that opportunity. He's one of the most exciting receivers in the NFL and with a really successful team, so that's a really exciting game to be bringing to Munich.\"\n\nJacksonville have played in each London series since 2013 and this will be the third time they play back-to-back games in the UK.\n\nThe Jaguars were the first team to play two international games in the same season in 2023 and have taken the option to have two home games in London this year while their stadium is being renovated.\n\nThey will play at Wembley and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the Washington Commanders hosting the other game at Tottenham.\n\nWhile Washington, who won three Super Bowls between 1983 and 1992, played in the NFL's first game in Spain last season, this will be just the second time the franchise has played in London and the first since 2016.\n\n\"Washington's traditionally had a good following in the UK,\" said Hodgson. \"It's been a long time since they were here so I think people will be excited to see the Commanders.\n\n\"They're just a year and a bit removed from being one game away from the Super Bowl, and I'm sure they are intent on finding their way back to the play-offs in 2026.\"\n\nHodgson also hinted at a special celebration to mark the 20th anniversary of the first regular-season game that was played in London in October 2007.\n\n\"The NFL continues to go from strength and strength when it comes to playing games around the world,\" he said. \"The commissioner and [team] ownership have been intent on really trying to find ways to expand the global footprint of the NFL, but at the heart of that is where this started.\n\n\"We've been here [in London] for nearly 20 years now so it's a really important market for the NFL. We've seen tremendous growth of the fanbase over that period of time, but yeah, the commitment by the NFL to playing in the UK is real and lasting.\n\n\"What's around the corner? Well, 2027 will be the 20th anniversary of games in London. We'll have to see what that brings.\"\n\nWhile the NFL will be playing games in Australia and France for the first time in 2026, the league will not make an immediate return to Ireland after staging its first Dublin game in 2025.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers' win over the Minnesota Vikings attracted more visitors from the United States than any of the NFL's 62 regular-season games played internationally.\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell said during Super Bowl week that the league \"will be back, I would guess in a few years\" and Hodgson was in Dublin this week to discuss the economic impact of last year's game.\n\n\"I think the Irish government were particularly excited about what that had done in terms of bringing visitors and, ultimately, the [overall] impact,\" he said.\n\n\"After that, I was able to have a conversation with some of the folks that we'd worked with initially to bring the 2025 game to Dublin and we had some positive conversations about possibly bringing more games in the future.\n\n\"All of that is to be determined, but we said originally we would play a game there and then we would collectively sit down and reflect on whether it worked for both sides. I think everyone agrees that it was a real success by all standards and all measures.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\n49ers to host game as NFL makes Mexico return\n\nLondon, United Kingdom (two at Tottenham, one at Wembley)\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "What are the options facing England amid Jos Buttler's struggles at the T20 World Cup. Could they really drop their former captain?",
    "fullText": "It feels wrong to be even asking the question.\n\nJos Buttler is one of England's all-time white-ball greats – a two-time World Cup winner.\n\nBut the 35-year-old has looked horribly out of touch over the past few weeks and his two against Pakistan was his fourth single-figure score in a row.\n\nHe has put in extra net sessions and faced local spinners, padded up against England's options as well as coaches with the dog stick, yet nothing has lifted him from his slump as yet.\n\nCould England really make a change for Friday's final Super 8s match against New Zealand or next week's semi-final?\n\nHere are the options facing England and the issues at play…\n\nThis remains the most likely scenario – overwhelmingly so.\n\nCaptain Harry Brook strongly backed his predecessor after Tuesday's win over Pakistan, saying a return to form is \"just a matter of time\".\n\n\"People have got to cut him a little bit of slack,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He's been phenomenal. He's arguably our best player, he's [just] not hitting them out of the middle at the minute.\"\n\nButtler is the fourth highest run-scorer in T20 international history. He scored 83 from 35 balls against South Africa last September.\n\nBut the right-hander has not scored a fifty in any of his 16 international innings this winter and this is now the longest run of single-figure scores in his T20 international career.\n\nThough he has come through lean patches previously, the upturn has not always been immediate.\n\nAs England's 50-over World Cup spiralled in 2023, he did not score a fifty and made scores of nine, 15, eight, 10, one, five and 27 as his side exited the tournament.\n\nThis would be somewhat of a halfway house.\n\nWith Buttler struggling at the top, why not move him down the order where the pressure to score quickly is not as great? He does play the finisher role in 50-over cricket after all.\n\nButtler has batted at five and six 45 times in T20s for England, though not consistently since 2018.\n\nThis change would obviously require someone else to step up to open.\n\nEngland have various options, given both Tom Banton and Will Jacks are openers by trade.\n\nBut Banton was recalled specifically to play a role in the middle order because of his prowess attacking against spin. Jacks has also been England's player of the tournament so far with 159 runs from 90 balls as a finisher.\n\nBrook and Jacob Bethell have both opened in the Indian Premier League but Brook has just scored a stunning century at number three and Bethell is not the quickest starter.\n\nYou could simply swap Brook and Buttler, leaving Buttler to come in at first drop as he was up to the start of last summer for England. He also had a successful IPL at number three last year.\n\nThe way Buttler and Phil Salt complement each other in their opening partnership was viewed England's big strengths before the tournament, however.\n\nNone of these options are entirely straightforward.\n\nThe most drastic option also appears the least likely.\n\nButtler, who signed a new two-year central contract last year, has been a mainstay of England's white-ball teams for more than a decade. Could they really leave him out entirely for a World Cup semi-final?\n\nThat encounter may be at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, where Buttler has made scores of 94 not out, 89 and 116 in the IPL.\n\nBen Duckett is the spare batter in England's squad - another man struggling for form.\n\nDuckett is averaging 18.88 across 12 matches this winter across all formats and was out for a first-ball duck in his most recent innings at the start of the month.\n\nLeg-spinning all-rounder Rehan Ahmed would be a left-field replacement. That would be a massive call.\n\nPerhaps Friday's match against New Zealand, effectively a dead rubber for England given they are already through, is the perfect, pressure-free opportunity for Buttler to help make the hierarchy's decision an easy one.\n\n\"Who is writing Jos Buttler off?,\" said former England spinner Alex Hartley.\n\n\"If you are, get a grip. He is one of those players where it takes one shot crunched through the covers and he will be back.\n\n\"It would be a worry if England were not winning games. I have no doubt when push comes to shove Jos Buttler will be OK.\"\n\n'The day Brook showed he is an England leader'\n\nStunning Brook century leads England into semis\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

However, both clubs have borrowed to pay for new stadiums.\n\nUnited are yet to say how they intend to finance their new ground, which is likely to cost more than £2bn, although the figures show why the club are so keen to return to the Champions League after a two-year absence.\n\nTotal revenues for the period in question were £190.3m, with commercial revenue dropping 8% from the previous 12 months to £78.5m. However, wages also fell by 9% to £75.1m.\n\nSince taking a 29% stake in the club two years ago, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has instigated major cost-cutting, including two rounds of redundancies that have cut 450 jobs.\n\nIn addition, many staff perks, including a paid-for staff canteen, have been axed.\n\nUnited sources argue this has allowed more to be invested on the data side of the club.\n\nThere was no mention in the financial statement about the amount United paid to sack head coach Ruben Amorim as this took place after the reporting period.\n\n\"We are now seeing the positive financial impact of our off-pitch transformation materialise both in our costs and profitability,\" said Berrada.\n\n\"We continue to take a football-first approach and today's results demonstrate the underlying strength of our business as we continue to push for the best football results possible for our men's and women's teams.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

New Zealand can seal their place in the semi-finals with victory over England on Friday, while Sri Lanka face Pakistan in Pallekele on Saturday.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Everton failed to create enough meaningful chances and a 1-0 loss to Manchester United extended their winless streak at Hill Dickinson Stadium. They haven’t won at the waterfront venue in their last six games.\n\nA lightning-quick counter-attack led by Bryan Mbeumo and finished off by Benjamin Sesko caught David Moyes’ backline committed high up the pitch. Chances for the hosts were few and far between and Everton’s overall game lacked pace and precision.\n\nThey have dropped to ninth in the league standings following this result.\n\nHere are the player ratings from Everton’s 1-0 loss to Manchester United at home:\n\nThe scoreline would’ve looked worse without Pickford making a stellar save off Amad early in the game. He also pushed away Dalot’s dangerous-looking cross but there’s little the Everton goalkeeper could’ve done to prevent Sesko from converting his 1v1. He also denied Sesko twice from a similar position in the closing stages of the contest.\n\nGarner was picked to delegate at right-back to replace the suspended Jake O’Brien for this clash. He made a crunching tackle on Cunha early in the game to retrieve possession and threatened from set pieces. Garner was more involved in the second half.\n\nTarkowski was forced into action early on and had to make that crucial goalline clearance after Pickford’s initial save off Amad. He also made a great interception off Bruno and was a constant menace during corner-kicks. Tarkowski, though, was completely beaten for pace by Sesko on the counter-attack that led to the United goal.\n\nTo be fair to Keane, he was never going to come out on top in the 1v1 footrace with Bryan Mbeumo however, he could’ve probably angled his body better to prevent Mbeumo from playing the pass to Sesko. Keane also brought out a fantastic save off Lammens with a left-footed shot from distance.\n\nForced to play out of position at left-back over Mykolenko, Branthwaite’s start to the game was shaky. However, he started growing into the role in the second half and tried to offer an outlet on the left with forward runs.\n\nGana misplaced a straightforward pass to Ndiaye in the first half which could’ve led to a dangerous United counter-attack through Cunha. He was also slow and was pegged back all game, not able to influence proceedings up the pitch. Gana’s hopeful shots from distance were either blocked or sliced wide off the target.\n\nIroegbunam could’ve dealt better with Mbeumo’s cross into the box that led to the chances for Cunha and Amad. He also gave possession away cheaply on a couple of occasions but showed a lot of energy with his runs and tackles.\n\nDewsbury-Hall failed to recreate his performance that led to the win at Old Trafford. Everton’s number 22 kept probing and continued to show for the ball, but the execution didn’t always come off. The majority of Everton’s attacks went through him in the second half but Dewsbury-Hall just couldn’t generate the final product or pass and was even wasteful on a few occasions.\n\nDidn’t have a major impact in the first half. Got more involved in the second, but his passes and deliveries into the box lacked their usual precision.\n\nPressed really well against United and almost had a chance after catching Lammens off guard from the first kick of the game. He was full of running but didn’t have any clear cut chances to capitalise on.\n\nArmstrong found himself with a great chance in the box early in the second half after being found by Dewsbury-Hall. However, his shot was aimed straight at the keeper. Armstrong was also forced to play wing-back for much of the game to help out Branthwaite with Dalot and Amad’s threat down that flank.\n\nPlaying the midfielder out on the wing also reduces the kind of direct threat that Everton are able to generate and the offense looked much better when Tyrique George came on.\n\nCame on and brought more intensity to Everton’s offence with his speed and direct runs towards the United’s defence. Tested Lammens from distance but failed to make the best of a chance that fell to him at the backpost in the closing stages.\n\nBarely had a touch on the ball.\n\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission. Comments are the responsibility of the poster. Disclaimer ()\n\n1 Posted 24/02/2026 at 07:12:47\n\nIf we scored a goal out of one of the ten corners we had, then I think a few of these marks would have been a bit higher, simply because I thought we gave the in-form team in the Premier League a very good test.\n\nThe corners began to frustrate me, but this is what you get with a David Moyes team. Loads of effort but not much variation, although I definitely thought we deserved at least a point for those efforts last night.\n\n2 Posted 24/02/2026 at 07:16:33\n\n3 Posted 24/02/2026 at 07:18:32\n\nI can't really argue with many of those ratings... quite accurate for once.\n\nThey competed quite well but the lack of decision-making and the poor end product on the final ball is a book we've read time and time again.\n\nLast night the expectancy was on Ndiaye, Dewsbury-Hall as being chief creators but it just didn't look like happening for either player.\n\nNdiaye can't seem to play two halves of football anymore... I don't know why.\n\nIroegbunam and Gana is not a midfield that will ever create or produce goals and that's pretty much what we got. I don't see either as long-term Everton midfielders, to be honest with you.\n\nPeople will say the striker was isolated but again, Barry just doesn't do enough for me, doesn't anticipate enough and give defenders enough of a hard time... but that's not something we are only just learning.\n\n5 Posted 24/02/2026 at 07:25:19\n\nI couldn't argue with the selections, tactics or substitutions.\n\nHowever,12 identical corners reminded me of the saying that madness is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result.\n\nOnce Beto came on, he and Barry should have decided which one would attack the near post. One frustrating ball in was cut out with both attacking the back post.\n\nOn the marks, I think you are a bit tight on Keane, who aside from the goal was solid and also, as usual, looked like our best centre-forward and Dewsbury-Hall, who had a far better game than your 6 suggests.\n\nIt was frustrating, but at least we always felt in the game, unlike many performances against strong opposition. And finally, the charge down from Barry in the opening seconds could have gone anywhere and changed the whole scenario.\n\n6 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:02:44\n\nGarner deserved an 8 playing out of position.\n\nHow did Tarkowski deserve a 7, nowhere to be seen when his man Sesko scored. Gana 4, Tim 4.\n\n8 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:18:17\n\nI think the 5 for Keane is harsh and the 7 for Tarkowski generous, both a 6 for me. Keane had our best chance at goal.\n\nFor me, we went for the win in the second half and paid the price by leaving ourselves vulnerable to the counter. Barry is a china doll who needs to toughen up but, to be fair, how many crosses went into him when we began to dominate the second half?\n\nBrainthwaite, Dewsbury-Hall, Gana, Armstrong and Ndiaye provide very poor crosses into the area. I thought Gana covered a lot of ground and he did what we expect him to do. Iroegbbunam did okay, sloppy in passing, but bust a gut when he did lose a ball to recover it.\n\nFinally, our corner tactics were disgraceful. Don't know if we have a set-piece coach but our efforts at trying to neutralise the skill of Lammens claiming corners seems to be born out of our own keeper's inability to do the same. No thinking outside the box.\n\n9 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:35:55\n\nWhy is Armstrong playing wide, we had Dibling and George on bench?\n\nIdrissa is past his sell-buy. He's been brilliant for us but past it. Aznou and Rohl have brilliant games then are not see again. Moyes is failing with the best squad we've had for a while.\n\nTarkowski and Keane have been good but their lack of pace was totally exposed. Where is Alcaraz? Moyes is gonna cost us good players and you can't blame them for leaving.\n\n11 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:41:08\n\nWhat game did Aznou have a brilliant game?\n\nSurely you are not talking about his cameo against Sunderland?\n\n13 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:49:54\n\nMoyes's score is a big fat Zero.\n\n14 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:50:14\n\n16 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:52:30\n\nYes, mate, I'm talking about the 20 minutes vs Sunderland.\n\nHe showed enough then for me. The kid's got talent... we're gonna lose him. (Bayern weren't happy losing him.)\n\n17 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:54:46\n\nAnjishnu, your player ratings are a low point on your click site. Let an Evertonian - MK -do it FFS. How shite is this site now.\n\n18 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:55:15\n\nMan Utd's goal is a perfect example of how we have fucked up by not buying two full-backs.\n\nThe sooner the two centre-backs are replaced by O'Brien and Branthwaite, the better.\n\n19 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:56:30\n\nAgree on the corners, Neil. No invention and just tried to bulldoze the ball into the net.\n\nEven if we would've scored, you're leaving yourself wide open for VAR to find something to disallow it with all the pushing and pulling going on.\n\n20 Posted 24/02/2026 at 08:59:07\n\nIt's individual choice on what you think the scores are. No one is right or wrong.\n\n21 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:00:16\n\n5 for Barry? Yes he did a lot of running; like a headless chicken as usual. He is as mediocre as his manager who rewards his uselessness with a start week after week.\n\nMind you, the buffoon in the Echo gave him 6!\n\n22 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:02:33\n\nBut PH, wouldn't you want an Evertonian like you doing it, mate?\n\n23 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:10:07\n\n24 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:10:32\n\nCan we have a rating for the Manager? 0.\n\nIf Moyes had prime Diego Maradona, he'd keep him on the bench, giving him 10 minutes to win us the game...\n\nSick to my back teeth of this fraud. He's stuck in a different era.\n\n25 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:10:37\n\nI think Davey can rightly point at a decent away record and say his tactics work. We are 6th in the table on away results.\n\nBut his stubbornness is costing us at home. Please try something different, we won't get into Europe with our home form, so try and change it.\n\nThose players who you don't think are good enough -- Dibling, Anzou, Rohl, Patterson -- cannot do any worse than your favourites.\n\nPlease make home games enjoyable.\n\n26 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:14:16\n\nPickford 6.8 Garner 7 Tarkowski 5 Keane 5.4 Branthwaite 5.5 Gana 4 Iroegbunam 5.1 Dewsbury-Hall 5.5 Ndiaye 5 Barry 5 Armstrong 6.5\n\n27 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:22:20\n\nWhat's the difference between a 5.5 and a 5.1?\n\n28 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:33:21\n\nJoe, if we had prime Maradona, he'd be the best right-back we've ever had!\n\n29 Posted 24/02/2026 at 09:57:52\n\nWe will be in the bottom half of the table after the weekend's games.\n\nI would be very surprised if we got back into the top half this season.\n\n30 Posted 24/02/2026 at 10:10:02\n\nJohn, we won’t. We’ll be lucky to escape the drop.\n\n31 Posted 24/02/2026 at 10:18:13\n\nPatterson at right back, Garner in midfield instead of Gana and George starting on the left last night and we win that.\n\nDrop Tarkowski, Keane and Gana asap. They're so last season!\n\n32 Posted 24/02/2026 at 10:44:16\n\nI didn't realise I was your mate, however, from what I saw of Aznou, and he was just in front of me at the game, was a player full of enthusiasm, trying to prove something. But he was all huff and puff, lost the ball a few times, fell over in the box and we got a very soft penalty.\n\nThat being said, if I may presume that he would come in in place of Mykolenko, then the questions are, can he defend, can he cross a ball? For me none of those questions were answered in his cameo.\n\nYes, I would like to see what he is made of and, if I were Moyes, the only option is to see if he can play both in attack and defence as a wing back with 3 centre-backs.\n\nFor balance, Patterson had a very good game that day and I would prefer that he be picked instead of O'Brien. I agree with you that Rohl did enough in the Villa game to get a start.\n\nYes, I am also frustrated with Moyes's lack of imagination and trying things out but, for me, last night we had a poor Man Utd there for the taking if we:\n\n1. Could provide accurate crosses.\n\n2. Could be more creative in set pieces.\n\n3. (Dare I say it) Committed to all-out attack which left us vulnerable at the back.\n\nI could see Moyes clearly on the sideline encouraging us to play forward and that was before they scored and we were dominant.\n\n33 Posted 24/02/2026 at 10:46:03\n\nRatings are to the individual's taste, that's why they are so different.\n\nI like Tarkowski but I would be inclined to give him a 0 simply because of the way he leads and enjoys the action at corners — fuckin' sickening to watch... and as someone else said, the manager and coaches deserve the same ‘0' for allowing and condoning this anti-footballing mess.\n\nAs Tony (@1) said, we deserved a point simply because Man Utd were as poor as us, with both teams contributing little to enjoy in this game.\n\n34 Posted 24/02/2026 at 10:52:41\n\nMan Utd, do they look like Champions League contenders?\n\nThe difference in the match, they could bring a £70M striker off the bench and he won the game.\n\nSadly, Everton can only dream of the above.\n\n35 Posted 24/02/2026 at 11:13:13\n\nI think Davey can rightly point at a decent away record and say his tactics work. We are 6th in the table on away results.\n\nBut his stubbornness is costing us at home. Please try something different, we won't get into Europe with our home form so try and change it.\n\nThose players who you don't think are good enough --Dibling, Anzou, Rohl, Patterson -- cannot do any worse than your favourites.\n\nPlease make home games enjoyable.\n\n36 Posted 24/02/2026 at 11:22:05\n\nGana and Iroegbunam should've been subbed at half-time along with Tarkowski, they were awful.\n\nMaybe if he had subbed them three, it might've been different... we will never know.\n\n37 Posted 24/02/2026 at 11:27:47\n\n\"Couldn't argue with the team selection or tactics.\"\n\nWe all must presume that Moyes is your uncle or your neighbour. I suspect that 98% of us here would happily \"debate\" your conclusions. With very nearly the whole squad available, only 4 had to play out of position and 2 of those are our best centre-back (who would have kept pace with Mbuemo) and our best midfielder, who would likely have created some chances for our strikers to miss.\n\nTeam selection and tactics were shameful, negative and appalling. Please tell me if I am wrong.\n\n38 Posted 24/02/2026 at 11:30:26\n\nHere we go again. Tarkowski fails miserably and Keane gets the blame for it. Groundhog Day.\n\nYou say Keane was never going to come out on top in a footrace with Mbeumo, but that is exactly what he did. He got goal side of his man and held him up. What else could he have done?\n\nTarkowski is becoming a caricature of his former self. He had a 2-yard start on the Man Utd scorer and was quite literally left for dead. His behaviour throughout that sequence of corners was excruciating... And you give him a seven???\n\n39 Posted 24/02/2026 at 11:33:27\n\nFor all the criticism of full-backs and midfielders, the league table shows our total lack of a finisher is costing dear.\n\nThe failure to address this will cost us at least five places by season's end... although TFG may well have budgeted for 14th place, anyway!\n\n40 Posted 24/02/2026 at 11:36:56\n\nHow many chances did we create for the forwards to miss last night, Derek?\n\n41 Posted 24/02/2026 at 11:40:38\n\nThe away form is the only saving grace for Moyes so far.\n\nOnce that goes, and it inevitably will, there are too many tough games upon the horizon to keep churning wins in all of them, the tide will become harder to swim against.\n\nFans aren't happy and rightly so with the whole transition of going to a new stadium, which is difficult to get to and from, and it's even more problematic on bloody midweek nights and all they are seeing really now is home failures.\n\nAt one time, night games under the lights at Goodison were special occasions, they weren't over frequented like this nonsense we are having this season, and opposition teams dreaded coming to Goodison under the floodlights.\n\nFans aren't happy, I don't think anyone can say it's been a good transition from Goodison Park to the new stadium. We all expected teething problems, that's a natural occurrence going to any new home, but they are being served less than appealing football, not enough goals; wins and overall entertainment value is low.\n\nIt's putting pressure on getting results in every away game. Up to Newcastle on Saturday and frankly, if we play like we did in the first half at Fulham and Brighton, we'll get smashed.\n\nBurnley next Tuesday will be another banana skin on every step, small club coming here with nothing to lose, on a slightly upward curve, it's a fixture that's got Wolves written all over it again.\n\n42 Posted 24/02/2026 at 12:43:25\n\nDarren @38. Absolutely spot on.\n\nTarkowski was too far up the pitch, Sesko went past him like he was standing still. Keane did at least enough to prevent Mbeumo from going in direct at goal.\n\nEnough has been said about players being asked to play out of position but can I mention Coleman being on the bench? I'm a big fan of Seamus, a great servant to the club, but I'm afraid as far as being a Premier League player, he's finished. So why is he taking a place up on the bench when we could have had Alcaraz or Aznou there?\n\nAs for the corners, as one poster has already said, if we had scored, I feel it would have inevitably been ruled out by the Ref or VAR.\n\nThe question for me is whether the modern player is a robot? Programmed to follow out tactics no matter how the game is going? Was there not anyone who was able to think to try something different when the same nonsensical tactic failed time and time again?\n\nI would love to know what goes on at Finch Farm and, in particular, what the coaches do.\n\n43 Posted 24/02/2026 at 13:56:12\n\nOnce more, Moyes is blaming the tactics on what he created.\n\nAs far as the wrestling from corners goes, it takes two to tango and the deliberate holding a player around the waist with 2 hands that is the tactic of a certain Man Utd player -- but never seems to get punished -- causes what is being called a wrestling match.\n\nLast night's performance was strictly on Moyes's team selection and their performance, and he should be reprimanded by the club and not offering excuses for the team he trained and selected. He is the one responsible for picking players who offer nothing every game, and sends out a team that seem void of direction, tactics and understanding of each other.\n\nIt seems that our new owners are not aware of what is going on at the club and rely on people they placed in the boardroom. I think they should understand, it is easier to lose money sliding down the Premier League rather than climbing it.\n\nEverton had got into a decent position in the Premier League but experimental team selection is going to cause more problems than answers and a sign of poor team selection and tactics; it is the responsibility of the manager who definitely failed last night.\n\nThe only satisfaction this season from last is we are not fighting against relegation... but that is no excuse for last night's experimental nonexistent performance -- that is on the manager's inept team selection and not worth his inexcusable comments.\n\nWe have the pride of Merseyside in a brand new stadium and that is being shamed with performances on the pitch that are fully on the manager's team selection. Their performances have been... let's just say, not very good.\n\nOther clubs have not allowed poor performances to go unnoticed and have made changes; is Everton close to becoming the same?\n\n45 Posted 24/02/2026 at 14:00:27\n\nMoyes came back to the club nearly 14 months ago. The way he talks in pressers, you would think he took over last week.\n\n46 Posted 24/02/2026 at 14:13:55\n\nI've just read a quote from Oliver Holt, a journalist with The Mail. I don't read this rag but I thought he summed things up pretty well.\n\nHe described the pre-match welcome led by Everton supporter group 1878s as \"spine tingling and concluded that Everton are still searching for home comforts.\"\n\n\"This was the 4th defeat in 6 home games, and for all their industry and endeavour, they are desperately lacking a cutting edge; when they find it, this place will become a fortress.\"\n\n47 Posted 24/02/2026 at 19:23:54\n\nPH:What's the difference between a 5.5 and a 5.1?\n\n48 Posted 24/02/2026 at 20:41:04\n\nTarkowski was poor; Keane not great, but better than Tarkowski.\n\nBizarre blaming Keane for their goal, he'd done his job, got goal side. Tarkowski floundering behind Sesko was the issue.\n\nI watched the game in a bar with a split audience. Man Utd fans referring to us as Stoke City following the corner kick fiasco.\n\nIt did look shocking to be fair. Brainless. Man Utd were very average, as were we. It was a poor game for TV.\n\n49 Posted 25/02/2026 at 09:20:29\n\nDarren spot on regarding Tarkowski, he's had a head start and was left for dead.\n\nI'm sick of his faux hard man routine, he's more interested in getting snide digs in at corners etc than looking for space,\n\nI can’t stand him, he's a yard dog, honestly can't wait to see him gone\n\n50 Posted 25/02/2026 at 09:44:06\n\nI said exactly the same on Mike Kendricks after match post. Tarkowski is no longer fit for purpose and because he is so slow its having a negative impact on how we play. As well as Tarkowski being the main problem for Utds goal, I don't think Branthwaites positioning is great either he is neither looking to go forward or covering a possible break and was in no mans land when the ball was played to Mbeuno. The only one who came out of that scenario with any credit was Michael Keane, he got goal side of Mbeumo preventing him having a shot but couldn't stop him squaring the ball for Sesko to score.\n\nSadly all Tarkowski wants to do is get into a physical battle and those days are long gone, when in possession it usually ends in either a 40 yard diagonal but mainly its the 30 yard hoof forward that usually runs through to their keeper.\n\n52 Posted 25/02/2026 at 10:19:30\n\nI'm so sick of excuses being made for Tarkowski, But we have to be very careful here.\n\nWe have to remember what a tremendous servant he has been for this club. In our darkest hour. He more than anybody personified the defiance which against all odds, kept us afloat. I want to focus on the ridiculous decision to keep playing him more than direct my anger at him personally.\n\nMoyes has previous for damaging a players legacy by playing him for too long. He's not alone. We as a club have been guilty of it for years Remember Reidy ?. Tarkowski's antics the other night made no sense to me at all. The one thing he still has is a prodigious leap. He is very powerful in the air. So why did he keep going onto the opposition line to get himself locked down in an all-in wrestling contest ? Was he acting under instructions ?\n\nHe'll still have his moments, but as a dependable Center half He is finished. has been for some time. He needs to be taken out of the firing line or the affection in which he is held by huge sections of the fan base will continue to erode.\n\nThe United goal was not on Tarkowski for no longer having the pace. it was entirely on Moyes for putting him in there knowing that to be the case.",

    "fullText": "Everton’s Senegalese stars, Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gana Gueye, are expected to benefit from the long break ahead of the clash against Manchester United.\n\nNdiaye and Gueye will get nearly two weeks’ rest to rejuvenate their batteries after accumulating a lot of minutes in recent months. While both have been regulars for David Moyes in the Premier League, they also led Senegal to Africa Cup of Nations triumph earlier this year and haven’t had a proper rest since returning from Morocco.\n\n“Hopefully they’ve now got themselves back into the speed of the Premier League,” David Moyes said in the pre-match press conference at Finch Farm.\n\n\"I thought both of them had started to pick up in the last game, they both started to show they were getting back to what I thought the speed of the Premier League is and the intensity of what is required here.”\n\nIdrissa Gana Gueye, of course, grabbed the limelight following a controversial sending off at Old Trafford in the previous fixture between the two sides earlier this season. Gueye slapped his own teammate, Michael Keane, before receiving a straight red and had to serve a three-game ban.\n\nEverton, however, led by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s fantastic strike pulled off a fantastic 1-0 win in Manchester and will be hoping to complete the double on Monday.\n\n\"Seems a long time ago but it was a huge 3 points because you have to try to pick up wins when you can and it didn't look likely as we went down to 10 men. We got a really good goal that night and did really well to hang on to it,” Moyes added.\n\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission. Comments are the responsibility of the poster. Disclaimer ()\n\nWhatever anyone feels about Moyes, it was still a very spirited performance and a massive win, Annika.\n\n4 Posted 20/02/2026 at 22:28:23\n\nMan Utd are playing better since Everton beat them but I still think a lot depends on how Bruno Fernandes dictates the game.\n\nOur home record is what scares me and we cannot be sure of beating anyone these days on our own turf.\n\nA lot has been said about Gana, who is not the player he was, and I still think he is a weak link on the defensive end of the midfield.\n\nMoyes should forget about a European place (he won't, of course) and concentrate on giving some of the bench warmers more starting time in readiness for next season.\n\nFernandes seems to love playing against Everton, Tom. The only time it hasn't looked like he was enjoying himself was in the game at Goodison when we were winning 2-0 last season.\n\nHe was rattled and didn't look like he was enjoying playing against a very aggressive Everton team that day. But we ran out of steam and suddenly him and Maguire were both back playing and suddenly had enough energy to start refereeing the game as well. But before this happened, it definitely looked like he didn't have the stomach for the fight.\n\nThe key to Everton turning Bramley-Moore Dock into a fierce ground that nobody really enjoys coming to is getting the team playing aggressively and on the front foot whenever it's possible.",

    "fullText": "David Moyes believes Everton need to “win some big games” between now and the end of the season if they want to continue making progress.\n\nThe Blues are temporarily ninth in the league table after 26 matches and as things stand, still remain in the hunt for European qualification. They have some big games lined up in the coming weeks against Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea and Everton can’t afford to lose steam against sides who are above them in the standings.\n\n“I think last year the nine games I had to play, I was thinking: ‘My goodness, how am I going to get any wins to stay in the Premier League?’ I think we’ve probably got over that completely,” Moyes said in the pre-match press conference.\n\n“I think the challenge now is can we change mentality, can we change the whole direction we’re going in? We’re not going to be that team anymore, fighting relegation, we’re a team who are planning to try and challenge the teams in Europe.\n\n“To do that, we’re going to have to win some big games in the run-in. We’re in a batch of big games.\n\n“We’ve got everybody fit bar Jack Grealish. So, we’re probably in as good a physical shape as far as that goes.”\n\nEverton players have enjoyed nearly two weeks of rest ahead of the game against Michael Carrick’s side on home soil. It comes as a breather especially for the Senegalese duo of Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gana Gueye who’ve accumulated a lot of minutes in recent months.\n\nSpeaking about the inconsistent schedule, Moyes added, “We’ve probably got a bit of disruption in terms of game times. We might have 10 or 12 days off, then suddenly we might have three games in eight days.\n\n“So, we’ve not got a particularly consistent calendar in terms of the games, but we’ve certainly got hard games to come.”",

    "fullText": "Everton Academy prospect Tyler Onyango has suffered a serious hamstring injury while on loan at Stockport County. He suffered the injury in their 1-0 defeat to Bradford during the week.\n\nOnyango has been with Everton since 2018, but he has failed to make much of an impression on the first-team, with just five appearances since breaking through in 2021, and his existing Everton contract will expire before he recovers full fitness.\n\nHe has spent several seasons out on loan with clubs in the lower leagues after outgrowing the Under-21s and Premier League 2. He joined Stockport County for a second season last September, but the 22-year-old now needs to undergo surgery that means he will miss the rest of the season after just 13 appearances.\n\nOnyango turns 23 next month, but has played senior competitive football for a professional club just 55 times over the last 6 years: the reason being some incredibly bad luck with injuries.\n\nThis is set to be his fourth long-term injury in his career, having already missed a total of 46 games since 2021. His first injury was to his ankle, which ruled him out for 185 days. His second injury ruled him out for 146 days, while a previous hamstring injury 3 years ago saw him miss 100 days.\n\nHaving started all 10 of the League One encounters he has featured in with The Hatters this season, his footballing journey looks like following the vast majority of highly rated Everton Academy products who seem destined for a future that is a long way below the Premier League.\n\nActually, I suppose that headline might be unduly harsh.\n\nThe lovely folks in the Everton Academy do have previous for nursing the sick and infirm through their extended periods of recovery -- even when their Everton contracts have long since run out.\n\nI think we had three last season, Stan Mills... Sean McAllister, and of course the most notorious one: Dele Alli.\n\n3 Posted 20/02/2026 at 02:48:41\n\n\"The vast majority of highly rated Everton Academy products who seem destined for a future that is a long way below the Premier League.\"\n\nThe word Everton is superfluous in that sentence. It applies to ALL \"highly rated Academy products\" not just ours.\n\nMy pal AI says that 97% of Category 1 academy players ('the highest level of elite youth training') never appear in the Premier League at all, which means Onyango already beat staggering odds to appear even five times in the blue shirt.\n\n4 Posted 20/02/2026 at 03:45:52\n\nIt's weird thinking back under Ancelotti, he was in the first team mix (squad not playing regularly) but went nowhere.\n\nThat said, Godfrey -- the athlete with zero football ability -- was also in that group at a cost of £24M.\n\nJust amazing how much variance there is between players literally worth nothing and guys costing tens of millions and either way they end up going the same way due to injuries, aptitude or other factors.\n\n7 Posted 20/02/2026 at 23:55:49\n\nIt's good to see the Old Lady of Web Chatting alive and well and trying to solve this particular mystery which rarely delivers a comforting solution!\n\nFor me, it's mostly about luck. Luck in that a manager gives a kid a chance far earlier than others might and or preserves with hearing the lad in quotation slagged off after 3 games and doesn't give the right time. Or thought to positioning or strength on and off ball etc etc.\n\nLuck that the breakthrough is sustained and a Rooney born, the fabulously White Lion of the football world.\n\n8 Posted 23/02/2026 at 19:03:00\n\nMike (3) - \"The word 'Everton' is superfluous in that sentence. It applies to all \"highly rated Academy products\" not just ours.\"\n\nYes, we're no different from other clubs, that way. Over the years, when I check highlights of our loan-outs, finding names of erstwhile Everton youth players is pretty routine.\n\nWith Premier League wages being so attractive today, UK youths don't just have one another to compete with, they also have young talent from around the world as competition for first-team places.\n\nI wonder, if he came along today, would a skillful footballer like Leon Osman be able to compete in today's Premier League?",

    "fullText": "Everton fan groups are making a special plan to improve the atmosphere at Hill Dickinson Stadium when Manchester United visit on Monday.\n\nThe Blues have endured a rough patch at home lately and haven’t won at their recent waterfront venue since December 6. They’ve lost and drawn three games each since, with Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth inflicting a 2-1 loss in their most recent encounter.\n\nIn the 13 league matches that Everton have played at this ground since moving from Goodison Park last summer, the Toffees have recorded four wins, four draws and five losses. This stands in stark contrast to their impressive record on the road where they have six wins, three draws and four defeats.\n\nIn order to boost the atmosphere at the stadium and provide David Moyes and his players added impetus, Everton Supporter Group the 1878s are planning to unfurl more than 400 banners before kick-off, decking out of the ground's south stand.\n\nThey are hoping to outperform similar demonstrations done before the clashes against Arsenal and Leeds United, both games where the hosts failed to win.\n\nAn army of volunteers have been gathered to lay the flags out over the weekend. Fans in the south stand will be asked to wave any flags they find on their seats once the club begin songs over the PA system around 15 minutes before kick-off.\n\nKatie Carter, a leading figure of the 1878s, hopes that the display will help the players secure the double over Manchester United, having won 1-0 at Old Trafford in impressive fashion.\n\n\"It's one of the steepest stands in Europe, it can be intimidating if we make it that way, so let's decorate it with flags and let's fill it with noise and get it going,” she told Liverpool ECHO.\n\n\"Monday night is the perfect opportunity for that. Whether you know the person next to you or you don't, sing along with them, like get right behind them - make sure that everyone is stood-up, all singing and getting that atmosphere going in that ground.\n\n\"We've got it all there, ready, waiting for us. The stand itself is set up ready. We just need to make it feel like a cauldron of noise to help the players on the pitch.\"\n\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission. Comments are the responsibility of the poster. Disclaimer ()\n\nYou would see a change in atmosphere at our new stadium if we had decent kick-off times. These late kick-offs, Mondays and Sundays, are killing us off, I can't stand it.\n\nBring back the days of a meet-up before and after a Saturday afternoon game. But I think they're gone, to be honest.\n\nThe 1878 Group do a fabulous job of decking out the ground in flags and banners.\n\nThere have been times that the Hill Dickinson Stadium has resembled the bear pit only Goodison could generate, every visiting manager always commented on the atmosphere inside Goodison.\n\nLike most clubs who move stadium, it takes a few years for it to feel like home. You have been used to sitting around the same group of fans for years and now you are surrounded by new faces, which probably inhibits the atmosphere a little.\n\nAlways a special game against Man Utd, I can remember going to Old Trafford while still at school, they played the brilliant Real Madrid in a friendly. Both teams were packed with talent, Real had Di Stefano, Ghento, Suarez and Santa Maria. Man Utd had Best, Law, Charlton and Crerand.\n\nSeems nowadays you can't talk in glowing terms about great players who don't play for your own club.\n\nI think you are right that it takes a few years for a new stadium to feel like home. Of course, a better record will shorten that time but the atmosphere, style of play and results are, of course, interlinked.\n\nBut to see the fantastic 1878 Group working to improve the atmosphere is so great to see. As someone who can no longer get to games, the atmosphere can still reach me and others on TW through any way we can find to watch the game.\n\nAgree with Katie that the infrastructure of the ground is all there, so it is up to creating a partnership between the fans, the manager and the players. Maybe that may attract the owners to pop over too!\n\nBut, looking at other clubs with new stadiums, it doesn't happen immediately (though in the modern game, we demand and expect immediacy and maybe we always have) but I am confident we will make BMD a ground opponents don't like visiting quicker than others have.\n\nStepping back from the daily Moyes good/bad debate and immediate transfer rumours, I remain optimistic.\n\n6 Posted 21/02/2026 at 13:18:22\n\nI've seen Goodison Park in every single kind of mode, Brian. Happy, sad, snarling, mad, passionate and loud, or sometimes you could hear a pin drop in the crowd.\n\nI remember the Crystal Palace manager commenting that Goodison was hardly intimidating during the 1994 season, then remember how the crazy gang of Wimbledon couldn't wait to get off the pitch when we finally survived on the very last day of that horrible season.\n\nWhen it really matters, you will always be able to count on the Everton crowd. But, if we are not playing aggressively, not showing enough desire or positivity, or not playing on the front foot, then you aren't going to hear much from Evertonians, except groans, moans and language in bad tones.\n\nBut once the team starts having a proper go, the people always come alive.\n\n8 Posted 23/02/2026 at 03:27:50\n\nIt's likely the logistics of the season ticket system that has screwed with the atmosphere.\n\nThe Gwladys Street End and other pockets of the ground are now spread over different parts of the new ground.",

    "description": "Graham Potter is hoping Alexander Isak will be able to play against Ukraine on March 26th.",
    "fullText": "Back in the autumn, following Liverpool’s big money signing of Alexander Isak but with the player not fully match fit following an acrimonious departure from Newcastle United that saw him miss pre-season as he pushed for the move, Sweden national team manager Jon Dahl Tomasson went out of his way to protect the player.\n\nWith Sweden then failing to secure a World Cup berth via UEFA qualification, Jon Dahl Tomasson lost his job. His replacement, Graham Potter, still has the chance to qualify them to next summer’s expanded 48-team World Cup via a playoff thanks to the country’s success in the Nations League. And there are questions as to whether he’ll be as careful with Isak’s health as Tomasson.\n\n“Right now we’re just keeping our fingers crossed,” Potter said when asked by Swedish journalists about the possibility of a trio of key injured players including Liverpool striker Isak back in time face Ukraine in late March. “Hopefully we can get some of those guys back—but if not, we have to find a solution with the guys that are available.”\n\nIn addition to Isak, Potter and Sweden are without  Dejan Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall. Kulusevski is by all accounts ruled out through the qualification playoff period, but the end of March falls close to when Isak and Bergvall might be getting their first on-pitch minutes—though it’s hard to imagine either being match fit.\n\nSweden will play Ukraine on March 26th in a semi-final, with the winner then taking on the winner of Poland vs. Albania in the March 31 qualification final to secure one of those four nations a place at the 2026 World Cup in a group with Netherlands, Japan, and Tunisia.",

    "fullText": "When meeting with reporters at the 2026 NFL combine, general manager Chris Ballard provided an update on Indianapolis Colts' defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, who underwent a procedure on a neck injury.\n\nBuckner originally landed on injured reserve in Week 9 with a neck injury he sustained against Pittsburgh. After missing several weeks, Buckner returned for the Colts' Monday Night game against San Francisco in Week 16, but would reaggravate the injury.\n\nHe was then placed on injured reserve and had successful surgery before the Colts' 2025 season was over.\n\n\"He's good,\" Ballard said of Buckner. \"I think it was some relief for Buck when he got it done. He's had injuries in his career but really it was the first time that he had one that was pretty serious. And then getting the surgery done, the relief that I think he felt -- one, knowing I feel better. Instantly felt better. And two, I can play football again.\"\n\nCompared to the defensive tackle position group league-wide, Buckner ranks 24th in pass rush win rate and 14th in PFF's run stop rate metric.\n\nEven with missing most of the second half of the season, Buckner is still second on the Colts' defense in pressures.\n\nThe 2026 season is the final year of Buckner's current deal. Ballard expects that Buckner will be good to go for training camp, if not sooner.\n\n\"I'm not going to put a timeframe on it,\" Ballard said. \"We're expecting him back for training camp. The way he works and who he is, it wouldn't surprise me if it's sooner.

    "fullText": "Canadiens' Patrik Laine $8.7 million trade obstacle is less intimidating than it appears originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPatrik Laine has missed most of the season with an injury. That would be the first obstacle to trading him before the NHL's March 6 trade deadline.\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens got good news on that front, though.\n\n\"He hasn’t played a game since October after having surgery on a core muscle, but Laine returned to practice with Montreal over the Olympic break, and the potential for a trade involving the scoring winger is growing,\" wrote Sportsnet's Nick Kypreos in a new trade article on Tuesday.\n\nThe other thing that looms large about Laine is his $8.7 million cap hit. That's not as intimidating as it appears, though.\n\n\"His $8.7 million cap hit might be high at first glance, but Laine is in the final year of that deal, so it’s a low-risk pickup for a team,\" Kypreos writes. \"Montreal also hasn't used any of its salary retention slots, so it would entertain the idea of lowering Laine's cap hit for a trade partner.\"\n\nMORE: Maple Leafs have a very specific draft pick reason to tank\n\nThat number might still eliminate some teams from trade talks, but there are some contenders who could make it work with Montreal.\n\nThe biggest concern might really be Laine's health. It'd probably increase confidence for an acquiring team if Laine got back on the ice in the next week with the Canadiens just to confirm everything looks OK.\n\nIf he's healthy, he's worth looking into.\n\n\"If you’re a team that needs to find some scoring and wants to take a chance on Laine for a couple of months, he’s certainly attainable for little cost,\" Kypreos writes.\n\nAuston Matthews, Maple Leafs now forced to face tough reality\n\nJack Hughes has forever changed his value\n\nZach Werenski made 'the play before The Play'\n\nConnor Hellebuyck has changed his story forever\n\nAlex Ovechkin has shared an update on his retirement plans\n\nEvgeni Malkin gets big news on a possible future",

    "fullText": "Rich Beem has given some insight into what viewers at home might not pick up on about how Scottie Scheffler acts on the course, as the world number one looks to get back on track after an odd start to the year.\n\nScottie Scheffler may have already picked up a win this season, but his slow starts in recent events have caught more attention than his victory at The American Express.\n\nHe’s failed to shoot under par in the opening rounds of his last three tournaments: the WM Phoenix Open, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and now the Genesis Invitational.\n\nOn Thursday at Riviera, he was five over through 10 holes when play was suspended, marking the worst opening round of his PGA Tour career.\n\nWhat’s made things stranger is how he has responded each time. Despite the slow starts, Scheffler hasn’t finished lower than 12th this year and was just one shot away from making the playoff at TPC Scottsdale.\n\nSpeaking on the Sky Sports Golf Podcast, Rich Beem said he is confused by what is happening with Scheffler right now. He also pointed out that the 29-year-old might not be as calm as people think.\n\n“I can’t explain it. Somebody has asked me what’s going on with Scottie Scheffler? Well, he’s human, first of all, we know that. It doesn’t make sense, especially from the standpoint of Phoenix, he still went out and made five or six birdies in the opening round and still shot over par,” he said.\n\n“I can understand maybe Riviera, opening day, very tough. I can even understand maybe a little bit where you get off to a bland start at Pebble Beach. It’s not going to get any easier going forward. I’m assuming his next start is going to be Bay Hill where he’s won. Then he’s going to go to The Players Championship, one of the hardest golf courses on tour.\n\n“It’s a trend that could continue just because of the venues, not that I fully expect it to, but it’s just not happening for him. And we all know that he gets a little hot under the collar at times. Maybe some people don’t quite see it as much as we do in the media when we follow him every day.”\n\nThere’s an argument that Scheffler handles pressure better than anyone else in the field. Few players look as relaxed when they’re out in front.\n\nBut heading into 2026, it’s been a while since we’ve seen him truly at his best. Even when results dipped early last season, he was coming off a hand injury – and most understood the slow return.\n\nHe’s had his moments of frustration too. The one that stands out is his reaction during the BMW Championship in 2024, which drew plenty of criticism at the time.\n\nEven so, you have to give Scheffler credit for how he’s managed to fight back recently. In each of his last three starts, he turned things around when it could have gone wrong.\n\nIf he hadn’t found a way to channel that frustration, there’s every chance he’d have missed two cuts already this season – and not by narrow margins either.\n\nWyndham Clark says if women’s golfers should be allowed to play on TGL\n\nRory McIlroy’s recent comments suggest a new caddie is needed to take his game to the next level\n\n90-year-old Gary Player shares key golf swing advice with eye-catching workout video",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI: The Ranji Trophy final witnessed extraordinary scenes on Day 2 as Jammu and Kashmir captain Paras Dogra lost his temper and headbutted a Karnataka substitute fielder, triggering heated exchanges and forcing umpires to step in at the Hubli Cricket Ground on Wednesday.\n\nGo Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. \n\nThe flashpoint came in the 101st over of Jammu and Kashmir’s first innings when Dogra was batting alongside Kanhaiya Wadhawan during a crucial partnership. After edging a delivery from Prasidh Krishna for a boundary, Dogra exchanged words with substitute fielder KV Aneesh, who was stationed at forward short leg.\n\nAs the verbal duel escalated, Dogra suddenly charged at Aneesh and headbutted him with his helmet. The shocking act stunned players and officials alike, with Karnataka captain Mayank Agarwal quickly intervening to defuse the situation while umpires rushed in to restore order.\n\n— NihariVsKorma (@NihariVsKorma)\n\nDogra apologised at the end of the over, but Aneesh refused to accept it, remaining visibly upset. The tension did not end there, as Agarwal and KL Rahul joined in, directing sharp verbal responses towards the Jammu and Kashmir skipper.\n\nMatters threatened to spiral further when Karnataka pacer Vijaykumar Vyshak and Wadhawan clashed moments later following accidental contact during a run. The pair came face to face before umpires and teammates stepped in to separate them, preventing another confrontation.\n\nDespite the dramatic scenes, Jammu and Kashmir continued to dominate the contest. The visitors strengthened their position by moving past 350-mark, building on the strong foundation laid on Day 1.\n\nEarlier, Shubham Pundir’s magnificent 121 had put Jammu and Kashmir in control, while valuable contributions from Yawer Hassan (88) and Abdul Samad (61) kept Karnataka on the back foot.",

    "fullText": "Editor’s note: This article is part of the Bracket Central series, an inside look at the run-up to the men’s & women’s NCAA Tournaments, along with analysis and picks during the tournaments.\n\nBubble teams are officially in desperation mode. With only one week left in the regular season and conference tournaments looming, few chances remain for resume-boosting wins. But all hope is not lost — Clemson and Virginia proved that over the weekend.\n\nHere’s who’s in, who’s out and who needs to channel the magic of March before Selection Sunday arrives:\n\nIt was a massive weekend in the ACC. After winning 17 games in a row, including 15 in conference play, Duke finally suffered a defeat. So did Louisville, the conference’s second-place team behind the Blue Devils. In the grand scheme of things, the losses won’t affect Duke and Louisville when it comes to seeding, but the teams on the other side of those upsets get huge boosts.\n\nClemson defeated Duke 53-51 off a 3-pointer from junior Hannah Kohn, and Virginia snuck past Louisville on a 3 from senior Romi Levy with 13 seconds left to play.\n\nSimilar endings for teams with similar resumes make for similar results. In other words, both Clemson and Virginia are on the right side of the bubble. Not only are their victories categorized as Quad 1 wins, but they also come at the perfect time. With just one week left in the regular season, wins mean more. The committee wants to see teams in the tournament that are having success right now. When Selection Sunday comes around, Clemson and Virginia will be top of mind.\n\nMississippi State is 11th in the SEC with an 18-10 record. At first glance, the Bulldogs don’t seem like a March Madness squad. But luckily for them, the committee doesn’t make decisions based on a glance.\n\nPlaying in the SEC has provided Mississippi State with a major resume boost in multiple ways. First, it helps with both NET ranking and strength of schedule. It also provides opportunities for quality wins. Mississippi State has two Quad 1 wins and one Quad 2 win, beating Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia. The Bulldogs have a couple of bad conference losses to Florida and Missouri, but the big wins more than make up for those stumbles.\n\nLast week we talked about Nebraska’s bizarre resume, which was missing one major thing: a Quad 1 win. Now, in addition to a No. 28 ranking in the NET and the 12th-best strength of schedule, Nebraska finally has a signature win. The Huskers went on the road Sunday and defeated Washington 66-65, which also snapped a six-game losing streak. As it stands, Nebraska will sneak into the field as one of the last four teams. A win or two in the Big Ten tournament would ensure a bid, but a loss to Rutgers in its last regular-season game would almost certainly spoil Nebraska’s chances.\n\nThe closer we get to tournament time, the more likely the Ivy League looks like it will be the only two-bid mid-major conference. After losing to Columbia twice, Princeton is in second place in the Ivy, but these two squads likely will meet in the conference tournament championship. That should be enough for both to earn bids given their overall strong resumes.\n\nAs for other mid-majors in the hunt, Richmond’s back-to-back losses to George Mason and George Washington (the latter a Quad 4 loss) slim the chance of earning an at-large bid. The same goes for South Dakota State, which needs to avenge earlier losses to North Dakota State and South Dakota in its final two games in order to make a March Madness push.\n\nThe Bracket Central series is sponsored by E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur have yet to speak with Mauricio Pochettino over appointing him as their next permanent manager, according to talkSPORT presenter Alan Brazil. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium club reportedly were open to appointing a temporary boss until someone like Pochettino is available in the summer. Spurs have since given Igor Tudor the job until the end of the season, but the North London club are not in contact with the Argentine, claims Brazil.\n\nPochettino will be available to return to club football after the World Cup in June, but it appears Tottenham want to wait until the end of the season before making any decision. They are not guaranteed safety right now and will need to hold on to their Premier League status to bring their former manager back. The Lilywhites are 16th in the league table ahead of the remaining 11 games of the campaign, and failure to quickly turn their fortunes on the pitch around could be hugely disastrous.\n\nTudor wants the permanent job but he needs to keep Spurs up to boost his chances.\n\nPochettino remains a target for Tottenham despite not holding talks with him yet, but there are no guarantees he has what it takes to turn them into domestic heavyweights again given various underlying problems at the club.\n\nSpurs could do with new owners going forward if they really want to start competing with the bigwigs in the Premier League again.",

    "fullText": "As Barcelona’s presidential campaign gathers pace, Lionel Messi’s name continues to surface, despite the player having no desire to be part of the political noise surrounding the club.\n\nIn fact, a recent report from MARCA reveals that banners and indirect references to the Argentine legend are being used by candidates without his knowledge or consent.\n\nFurthermore, according to sources close to Messi, he has not held conversations with any of the presidential hopefuls and does not intend to do so while the electoral process is ongoing.\n\nThe irony is striking, as Messi has become one of the most talked-about figures in the campaign, yet he has actively chosen to remain on the sidelines.\n\nFrom the very beginning, he did not want to influence or be associated with any candidacy.\n\nOne of the clearest examples came from Marc Ciria, who displayed a banner in Barcelona carrying the phrase “Looking forward to seeing you again.”\n\nAlthough the message avoided directly naming Messi or showing a clear image of him, the meaning was obvious to supporters.\n\nThe gesture created buzz, but it reportedly took Messi’s camp by surprise.\n\nThere was also movement from Victor Font. It is said that attempts were made to connect with individuals close to the Argentine.\n\nThose efforts, however, did not lead to direct contact. Font has since explained that any past communication occurred years ago and not with Messi personally.\n\nMeanwhile, the last club president, Joan Laporta, has publicly discussed his relationship with the former captain.\n\nLaporta has spoken about Messi’s departure and the possibility of a testimonial, stating that the final decision rests with the player. For now, though, only Laporta’s perspective has been aired publicly.\n\nAs such, Messi’s entourage continues to repeat the same message that there will be no involvement, either openly or quietly.\n\nEven if certain developments in the campaign have not pleased him, he will not intervene.",

    "description": "NFL.com's Bucky Brooks dropped his second mock draft of the year.",
    "fullText": "We are just under two months away from the actual 2026 NFL draft, and the mock drafts have already gotten a bit boring for the Arizona Cardinals, at least in those created by analysts for NFL.com. The Cardinals have the third overall pick in the draft and have several needs, but the recent batch of projections have them going with the same player.\n\nBucky Brooks published his second mock draft of the year. He has the Cardinals going with an offensive tackle.\n\nWith or without Kyler Murray, the Cardinals need to find a tackle to man the right side opposite athletic LT Paris Johnson Jr. Mauigoa is a talented edge blocker with the size, strength and nastiness to bully opponents at the point of attack.\n\nAs boring as it sounds, the pick makes sense. The Cardinals have a gaping hole at right tackle and uncertainty at quarterback. Locking down another side of the line will help whoever is starting under center.\n\nIt would mark the first time under general manager Monti Ossenfort selects a player outside the Big Ten or SEC in the first or second round of the draft, but the Cardinals recently added two former Miami assistants to their staff.\n\nHowever, if Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese is on the board as he is in this mock draft, it will be hard for the Cardinals now to take him, as they also have a huge need for an edge rusher to pair with Josh Sweat.\n\nAlso, keep an eye on Ohio State safety Caleb Downs. While safety is not a premium position and Ossenfort would be out of character to go with a safety in the top five, the Cardinals love Ohio State players.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "Christian Horner says Red Bull’s early-2025 decision to demote Liam Lawson after just two race weekends and replace him with Yuki Tsunoda was not his call",
    "fullText": "Former Red Bull Racing CEO and team principal Christian Horner has confirmed that it was not his choice to swap Liam Lawson for Yuki Tsunoda at the start of the 2025 Formula 1 season.\n\nIt was confirmed at the end of 2024 that Sergio Perez, who had been with the Milton Keynes outfit since 2021, would be replaced by New Zealander Lawson for the 2025 season. Taking the position next to four-time champion Max Verstappen, Lawson competed in just two race weekends before he was demoted to Racing Bulls, with Tsunoda taking his place ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nThe decision came as a shock, as Lawson only had two grands prix and one sprint race at tracks he had not raced at before to prove himself in the seat. Horner, talking in the upcoming eighth season of Netflix's Drive to Survive, claimed that the decision did not come from him.\n\n\"It wasn't my choice. I was always pushed to take drivers from the Young Driver Programme. Helmut was a big driver in it,\" the Briton said.\n\nAfter 20 years as Red Bull Racing CEO and team principal, Horner was also replaced in his role by former Racing Bulls team principal Laurent Mekies. \"The reality is that for me over the last 20 years, on the good days and the bad days, it's been an epic journey,\" he reflected.\n\nFollowing his exit, there have been countless rumours linking Horner to a return to the championship, although nothing has been confirmed at this stage. \"I never imagined to be in this position,\" he added. \"Of course, your immediate reaction when you get delivered a s*** sandwich like that is like, f*** them. I've had something taken away from me that wasn't my choice, that was very precious to me.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The World Baseball Classic is not just a tournament; it is a high-stakes, emotion-fueled battleground where national pride is on the line with every pitch. Since its inception in 2006, the WBC has delivered some of the most electric, unforgettable moments in the sport’s history, transforming spring training tune-ups into global spectacles. The tournament brings together the absolute best players on the planet, allowing them to drape their country’s flag over their shoulders and compete for ultimate bragging rights.\n\nOver the course of five iterations, with the next chapter set to unfold in 2026, certain nations have separated themselves from the pack. They have built dynasties, broken hearts, and consistently found ways to survive the chaotic, sudden-death nature of international tournament play. Some of these countries rely on deep pipelines of MLB superstars, while others lean on established domestic leagues and unmatched team chemistry to topple the heavyweights.\n\nBut when the dust settles, the truest measure of a baseball powerhouse is simple: who wins when the lights are brightest? Taking a look at the all-time victory leaderboard heading into the 2026 tournament reveals a fascinating hierarchy of global baseball talent. It highlights the expected juggernauts alongside a few nations that consistently punch above their weight on the international stage.​\n\nFrom the passionate fanbases of the Caribbean to the meticulously crafted rosters of Asia and the deep talent pools of North America, here is how the most successful countries in World Baseball Classic history stack up.\n\nMexico has steadily evolved into a legitimate force on the WBC stage, proving it can hang with anyone in the world. Their unforgettable run to the semifinals in 2023, highlighted by a massive upset over Team USA, proved that their blend of MLB talent and fearless pitching is a recipe for deep tournament runs. They always bring the heat and a passionately loud fan base to the ballpark.​\n\nDo not let the European flag fool you; the Netherlands is an absolute baseball powerhouse fueled by elite talent from Curaçao and Aruba. They have a reputation as the tournament’s ultimate giant-slayer, most notably breaking Dominican hearts with a pair of stunning walk-off wins in 2009. With a consistently slick-fielding infield and timely hitting, they are a perennial threat to reach the championship rounds.​\n\nVenezuela’s rosters always read like an MLB All-Star ballot, loaded with franchise cornerstones and elite sluggers. While they have occasionally struggled to translate that immense on-paper talent into championship hardware, their explosive offense makes them a nightmare matchup. When their pitching staff aligns with their heavy hitters, they are practically unstoppable.\n\nSouth Korea approaches the WBC with a level of tactical precision and national pride that makes them an incredibly tough out. Their dramatic run to the 2009 final against Japan cemented their status as an elite baseball nation. Armed with contact-heavy lineups and fundamentally flawless defense, they know exactly how to execute in high-pressure situations.\n\nLong considered the boogeymen of international amateur baseball, Cuba’s rich history in the sport translates beautifully to the WBC. They stormed to the finals in the inaugural 2006 tournament and have consistently remained a threat ever since. Even as the global talent pool has deepened, their aggressive style of play and raw athleticism demand total respect.​\n\nThe Dominican Republic brings a level of swagger and star power to the WBC that is simply unmatched. Their dominant, undefeated run to the 2013 championship remains one of the most impressive feats in tournament history. When this island nation gets rolling, it transforms the stadium into a massive party, fueled by elite pitching and light-tower power.\n\nDespite inventing the game, Team USA took a while to fully figure out the unique rhythm of the World Baseball Classic. They finally broke through to claim the crown in 2017 and followed it up with a thrilling run to the 2023 final. When the American superstars fully buy in, their sheer depth of talent is an overwhelming force of nature.\n\n​\n\nNo team plays with more visible joy, passion, and chemistry than Puerto Rico. They have suffered consecutive heartbreaking defeats in the 2013 and 2017 championship games, but their consistency is undeniably impressive. Famous for their blond hair dye and relentless energy, they are the heartbeat of the tournament and an absolute joy to watch.\n\nSamurai Japan is the undisputed king of the World Baseball Classic, boasting three tournament titles and an unmatched aura of dominance. From Daisuke Matsuzaka’s heroics in 2006 to Shohei Ohtani’s epic 2023 strikeout, their WBC history is the stuff of legend. Their incredible fundamental execution and elite pitching depth make them the ultimate gold standard of international baseball.\n\nMORE: Top 10 Winter Olympians of Team USA since 2000\n\nThe beauty of the World Baseball Classic lies in its unpredictability, where a single pitch can alter the course of a nation’s sporting history. While Japan currently sits comfortably on the throne, the gap between the traditional powerhouses and the rest of the world is rapidly closing. As we look ahead to 2026, the stage is set for new rivalries, fresh upsets, and another thrilling chapter in the greatest international baseball showcase on earth.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Most wins in World Baseball Classic’ appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "The Cognizant Classic is a once-great event that has suffered from PGA Tour changes in recent years. It used to host the very best players on the planet with incredibly talented fields.",
    "fullText": "The Cognizant Classic is a once-great event that has suffered from PGA Tour changes in recent years.\n\nIt used to host the very best players on the planet with incredibly talented fields. Tiger Woods famously chased down Rory McIlroy with his best-ever Sunday score, a 62, as McIlroy rose to world number one in 2012.\n\nBut its place on the PGA Tour schedule has cost it dearly. The event now takes place after the Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Genesis Invitational, and before the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Players, so it’s a popular event for players to sit out.\n\nWhat’s more, a change to PGA National last year drew complaints from a host of PGA Tour stars.\n\nPGA National used to be one of the toughest tests on the PGA Tour. Renovated by Jack Nicklaus, the course features the famous “Bear Trap” on the back stretch, which once struck fear into the hearts of players.\n\nBut recent changes, including swapping Bermuda grass for rye to soften fairways and greens, and removing some bunkers, took the teeth out of the course, much to players’ disappointment.\n\nJordan Spieth said, “I didn’t realize that it was overseeded, and the fairways being overseeded changes it a lot because it’ll make the fairways softer, which makes them wider, and then around the greens it’s significantly easier than the dormant Bermuda.\n\n“You’re looking at easily a stroke a round on just the change in the grass types in the fairway.”\n\nJake Knapp recorded a 59, the 15th sub-60 round in PGA Tour history, but he wasn’t the only one to go low on Thursday. 115 players were under par in the first round, with 15 of them shooting 65 or better.\n\nBilly Horschel, playing at his hometown event, was also disappointed by the changes, adding, “It’s just a little disappointing because it’s such a great test of golf.\n\n“I think the overseed has – the rough is not long enough. It’s not penal enough when you miss the fairway. If you had Bermuda rough and Bermuda fairways and if you missed the green you had to chip it off Bermuda instead of overseeded rye, it makes it a little bit tougher.\n\n“Hopefully, the wind picks up. Hopefully, we see a little bit of PGA National because it is fun playing this golf course when it’s tough. I think a lot of us do enjoy it.\n\n“I really wish we would just play this as a straight Bermuda. From tee to green, everything be straight Bermuda. I know it doesn’t look prettier on TV and I know that’s one of the reasons why it’s overseeded. So it is a little disappointing that – I’d say the condition of the course is very scorable.”\n\nThe changes from last year are still in play in 2026, so expect some low scoring again this weekend.",

    "fullText": "NFL fans have been dissecting Nick Sirianni’s latest comments about A.J. Brown after the Philadelphia Eagles head coach stopped short of offering a firm guarantee over the wide receiver’s future.\n\nBrown remains one of the franchise’s most important offensive weapons, but uncertainty around next season has sparked debate online.\n\nSirianni’s words have only added fuel to that discussion.\n\nSirianni said via ESPN, “A.J.’s a great player, and A.J. is a good teammate, and A.J. is a good person. Does he want to be here? Yes. Do I want him to be here? Yes.”\n\nHe continued, “Will A.J. be here next season? I think we’re still in a spot, like, I can’t guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season.\n\n“I’m thinking I’m going to be the coach next season, but you can’t guarantee anything past tomorrow.”\n\nThe response struck a balanced tone, praising Brown’s value while acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the NFL.\n\nContract dynamics, roster construction, and league movement can quickly alter situations, even for star players.\n\nReactions online ranged from alarm to dismissal. Some supporters immediately interpreted the lack of a guarantee as a warning sign, with one fan posting, “He’s gone. Bills for a deuce and Keon!” Another concluded, “So basically he won’t be in the squad for the Eagles next season.”\n\nSpeculation about potential destinations also surfaced. “Hard to be an Eagle when he’s a Patriot,” one comment read, hinting at divisional drama. Others urged caution, warning that “Letting go of A.J Brown will be a huge mistake.”\n\nNot everyone saw cause for panic. One fan countered the uproar by saying, “If anyone spends more than 5 seconds reading this headline, it’s obvious that they want him in Philly.”\n\nFor now, Sirianni’s stance suggests mutual interest remains. Whether that translates into long-term certainty will depend on decisions made in the months ahead.\n\nNick Sirianni gives cryptic answer about A.J.

    "fullText": "Sergio Perez is returning to the grid this year, joining Cadillac as the team prepares for its first season in Formula 1.\n\nHis time with Red Bull included highlights like his win at Monaco in 2022, but the partnership ended when both sides grew frustrated with each other.\n\nNow with a new team, Perez is looking to show he still has plenty to offer. His testing performances have drawn some criticism, but there’s hope that he’ll find his rhythm once the season starts in Australia.\n\nAt 36, Perez is one of the more experienced drivers on the grid and faces the challenge of competing against a younger generation. Still, he believes he can help lead Cadillac’s early success.\n\nSpeaking on the Back at Base podcast, Sergio Perez discussed his year away from F1 and how he plans to adjust this season.\n\nOutlining what he wants from his time with Cadillac, Perez was clear that he expects quick progress and is determined to go all in with the team.\n\n“Once you step out of it and you see it from the outside, you have learned a lot of things. For example, when you are in it, you tend to worry a lot of things that are not representative for the public,” Perez said. “When you have a bad race, you think the world is over. The highs and lows of the sport are extreme. Nothing is going to change on the outside. Just keep enjoying it…”\n\n“Yeah, I definitely want to go all the way with this team. I want to enjoy the journey with them, and I want to see progress quickly. This is what I’m here for.”\n\nAcross the garage, Perez’s Cadillac teammate Valtteri Bottas is also looking to reset, treating his first season with the team as a chance to reset and approach the sport with a new mindset.\n\n“It’s like a comeback. I’ve really approached the sport now with a different view of the sport, with more respect to the sport, more respect to the staff or the team members.”\n\nBottas has his sights set on making this season one of personal growth: “I want to make it the best season I’ve had, personally. I want to give it all to myself, but first of all to the team. So if I can finish next year with a feeling that there was nothing I could have done better, that is a good goal.”\n\nJolyon Palmer says not a ‘single aspect’ of Adrian Newey’s 2026 Aston Martin is working\n\nFranz Tost backs Oscar Piastri to challenge Max Verstappen for 2026 F1 title\n\nWill Buxton believes Ferrari’s 180-degree rear wing could be a game-changer in 2026 title fight",

    "description": "We’re open-sourcing mquire, a tool that analyzes Linux memory dumps without requiring any external debug information.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve ever done Linux memory forensics, you know the frustration: without debug symbols that match the exact kernel version, you’re stuck. These symbols aren’t typically installed on production systems and must be sourced from external repositories, which quickly become outdated when systems receive updates. If you’ve ever tried to analyze a memory dump only to discover that no one has published symbols for that specific kernel build, you know the frustration.\n\nToday, we’re open-sourcing mquire, a tool that eliminates this dependency entirely. mquire analyzes Linux memory dumps without requiring any external debug information. It works by extracting everything it needs directly from the memory dump itself. This means you can analyze unknown kernels, custom builds, or any Linux distribution, without preparation and without hunting for symbol files.\n\nFor forensic analysts and incident responders, this is a significant shift: mquire delivers reliable memory analysis even when traditional tools can’t.\n\nMemory forensics tools like Volatility are essential for security researchers and incident responders. However, these tools require debug symbols (or “profiles”) specific to the exact kernel version in the memory dump. Without matching symbols, analysis options are limited or impossible.\n\nIn practice, this creates real obstacles. You need to either source symbols from third-party repositories that may not have your specific kernel version, generate symbols yourself (which requires access to the original system, often unavailable during incident response), or hope that someone has already created a profile for that distribution and kernel combination.\n\nmquire takes a different approach: it extracts both type information and symbol addresses directly from the memory dump, making analysis possible without any external dependencies.\n\nmquire combines two sources of information that modern Linux kernels embed within themselves:\n\nType information from BTF: BPF Type Format is a compact format for type and debug information originally designed for eBPF’s “compile once, run everywhere” architecture. BTF provides structural information about the kernel, including type definitions for kernel structures, field offsets and sizes, and type relationships. We’ve repurposed this for memory forensics.\n\nSymbol addresses from Kallsyms: This is the same data that populates /proc/kallsyms on a running system—the memory locations of kernel symbols. By scanning the memory dump for Kallsyms data, mquire can locate the exact addresses of kernel structures without external symbol files.\n\nThese features have been consistently enabled on major distributions since they’re requirements for modern BPF tooling.\n\nAfter initialization, mquire provides an interactive SQL interface, an approach directly inspired by osquery. This is something I’ve wanted to build ever since my first Querycon, where I discussed forensics capabilities with other osquery maintainers. The idea of bringing osquery’s intuitive, SQL-based exploration model to memory forensics has been on my mind for years, and mquire is the realization of that vision.\n\nYou can run one-off queries from the command line or explore interactively:\n\nThe SQL interface enables relational queries across different data sources. For example, you can join process information with open file handles in a single query:\n\nThis relational approach lets you reconstruct complete file paths from kernel dentry objects and connect them with their originating processes—context that would require multiple commands with traditional tools.\n\nmquire currently provides the following tables:\n\nmquire also includes a .dump command that extracts files from the kernel’s file cache. This can recover files directly from memory, which is useful when files have been deleted from disk but remain in the cache. You can run it from the interactive shell or via the command line:\n\nFor developers building custom analysis tools, the mquire library crate provides a reusable API for kernel memory analysis.\n\nmquire can only access kernel-level information; BTF doesn’t provide information about user space data structures. Additionally, the Kallsyms scanner depends on the data format from the kernel’s scripts/kallsyms.c; if future kernel versions change this format, the scanner heuristics may need updates.\n\nWe’re considering several enhancements, including expanded table support to provide deeper system insight, improved caching for better performance, and DMA-based external memory acquisition for real-time analysis of physical systems.\n\nmquire is available on GitHub with prebuilt binaries for Linux.\n\nTo acquire a memory dump, you can use LiME:\n\nWe welcome contributions and feedback. Try mquire and let us know what you think.",

    "description": "AI prose is fluent, frictionless, and hollow. Why next-token prediction, RLHF, and model collapse are systematically and increasingly optimized against voice.",
    "fullText": "You can feel it before you can name it. A paragraph arrives, fluent and frictionless, and something in the back of your reading brain flinches. The sentences are grammatically flawless, the structure orderly, the tone warm but not too warm, authoritative but not too authoritative. It reads the way a hotel room looks, everything is there, nothing is wrong, and yet the text has no texture, no grain, no evidence that a particular person with particular opinions sat down and hammered it out. It is prose that has been to finishing school and learned nothing except how to be inoffensive at dinner.\n\nThis is the uncanny valley of writing. Large language models now produce text that is, by most surface measures, competent, in the way that a Marriott breakfast buffet is, by most surface measures, food. They can mimic registers, follow instructions, and generate passable copy in seconds. What they cannot do, reliably, is sound like anyone in particular. The words arrive clean, centred, sanded smooth, and they are, in a precise technical sense, the most probable words. Probability, it turns out, is the enemy of voice.\n\nReaders notice, even when they cannot articulate what they are noticing. A 2024 study from the University of Kansas found that when people suspected AI involvement in a piece of writing, their trust in the author dropped, even when the text quality was unchanged. The researchers called it a “transparency penalty.” Disclosure of AI authorship degraded perceptions of authenticity, effort, and sincerity. The interesting finding was that this penalty applied even when readers could not identify specific tells. They were not spotting bad grammar or factual errors but responding to an absence, some quality of personhood that should have been there and was not. The prose equivalent of talking to someone at a party who maintains perfect eye contact and says absolutely nothing of substance.\n\nAn LLM does one thing. Given a sequence of tokens, it calculates a probability distribution over what comes next and samples from it. The training objective, next-token prediction, means getting the next word right, billions of times, across terabytes of internet text, until the resulting model develops what looks like an understanding of syntax, argument, tone, even humour. Whether this constitutes understanding or merely a very expensive statistical trick is, as we shall see, contested, but the mechanical fact is not. Every word an LLM writes is the output of a probability calculation.\n\nThe consequences for prose style are baked into the architecture. A model trained to predict the most likely next token will, absent intervention, gravitate toward the centre of its training distribution. It will favour common words over rare ones, conventional syntax over eccentric syntax, safe constructions over risky ones. The resulting text has what researchers call low perplexity, meaning it is highly predictable, and low burstiness, meaning its sentence lengths and structures cluster tightly together. Human writing, by contrast, is irregular.\n\nPeople write long sentences and then short ones, use odd words because they like them, and break rules for emphasis. A 2024 study in Artificial Intelligence Review comparing human-written news text to LLM output across six models confirmed what any attentive reader already suspects, that humans exhibit more scattered sentence length distributions, more varied vocabulary, and shorter syntactic constituents. LLMs produce text that is more concise and uniform, with distributions that cluster around lower values and have tight interquartile ranges. In plain English, the machine writes within a narrower band, hedging, rounding off, converging on the middle. If you imagine the full range of human prose as a piano, the model is playing exclusively in the two octaves around middle C, and it has been told that those are the only octaves that exist. This is not a bug, but what the training objective selects for.\n\nThe base model, the raw output of pre-training, is actually wilder than what you encounter in ChatGPT or Claude. It contains the full chaotic range of internet text, from Wikipedia to Reddit rants to Nigerian business correspondence to academic papers. It can mimic any of these registers, but unpredictably. You might ask it for a recipe and get a manifesto. This is where reinforcement learning from human feedback enters the process, and where things get both interesting and depressing.\n\nRLHF works by having human annotators compare pairs of model outputs and choose which they prefer. These preferences are used to train a reward model, which then guides the base model toward outputs that receive high scores. The intention is to make the model helpful, harmless, and honest. The side effect is a flattened voice. RLHF introduces what the technical literature calls a mode-seeking mechanism, which narrows the range of outputs, pushing the model away from the tails of its distribution and toward a bland, deferential, faintly eager-to-please centre. The result is a prose style that reads like middle management wrote it, competent, cautious, and stripped of anything that might offend or surprise. Imagine a committee of well-meaning strangers voting on what makes a good sentence, and then imagine doing this millions of times. That is roughly what RLHF does to prose. You get the sentence that nobody actively dislikes, which is another way of saying you get the sentence that nobody remembers.\n\nThe annotators themselves leave fingerprints on this process. OpenAI outsourced much of its RLHF work to Sama, a data annotation company with operations in Kenya and Uganda, as well as to other vendors across sub-Saharan Africa. Alex Hern, writing in the Guardian, noted that the word “delve” is far more common in formal Nigerian and Kenyan English than in American or British usage. When RLHF annotators in Nairobi rated outputs, they naturally preferred phrasing that matched their own register, and the model learned accordingly. ChatGPT acquired a slight but measurable tilt toward West and East African business English that nobody designed, and nobody noticed until the word “delve” started showing up at an industrial scale in places it had no business being. It was, in hindsight, the world’s least intentional act of linguistic imperialism in reverse.\n\nDmitry Kobak and colleagues at the University of Tübingen studied vocabulary changes across 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010 to 2024. They borrowed a technique from Covid-era epidemiology, excess mortality analysis, and applied it to words. Instead of counting surplus deaths, they counted surplus vocabulary, and the results were stark. The word “delves” appeared in 25 times as many 2024 papers as pre-LLM trends would predict. “Showcasing” and “underscores” surged ninefold, while “crucial” increased by 2.6 percentage points across the entire corpus. The excess was unprecedented, and the researchers estimated that at least 10 per cent of 2024 PubMed abstracts had been processed with LLMs. In some subfields, the figure reached 30%. A generation of medical researchers, it seemed, had collectively decided that their findings were worth “delving into” at exactly the same moment.\n\nA follow-up study by Kei Matsui examined 135 potentially AI-influenced terms against 84 stable control phrases across PubMed records from 2000 to 2024. The control phrases, ordinary academic constructions like “all patients” and “results suggest,” held steady for two decades, doing their dull but honest work. The AI-influenced terms “meticulous,” “intricate,” “tapestry,” and “boast” spiked sharply after 2022, but the uncomfortable detail is that several of these words had already begun creeping upward in 2020, before ChatGPT launched. The lexical preferences of LLMs may have been seeded during the RLHF process, shaped by the vocabulary preferences of annotators whose influence preceded the public release of the tools. The contamination, in other words, ran deeper than anyone first assumed, and the timeline made it harder to draw a clean line between “human wrote this” and “machine wrote this.” Which, if you think about it, is precisely the problem.\n\nThe effect has a name now, AI-ese, and it is recognisable not because any single word gives the game away, but because the words arrive in concert. “Delve” on its own proves nothing, but “delve” alongside “crucial,” “underscore,” “intricate,” “foster,” and “tapestry” in a single abstract proves everything. The tells are combinatorial rather than atomic, like catching someone in a lie, not from one detail but from six details that are all a bit too perfect.\n\nThe irony is poisonous because Nigerian and Kenyan writers whose formal English naturally includes some of these terms are now being flagged by AI detection systems for writing in their own language. As Hern observed in the Guardian, if AI-ese sounds like African English, then African English sounds like AI-ese, and the stigma runs only one way. The celebrated writer Elnathan John put it sharply on X: “Imagine after being force-fed colonial languages, being forced to speak it better than its owners, then being told that no one used basic words like ‘delve’ in real life.” One might add that nobody asked the Kenyan annotators whether they wanted to teach ChatGPT to write like them, or whether they were comfortable becoming, in effect, the uncredited ghostwriters of the internet’s new house style.\n\nThere is a subtler problem than bad vocabulary. LLMs do not merely favour certain words but systematically strip specificity from prose. Ask a model to write about a jazz record, and it will give you “complex harmonies” and “innovative arrangements” when what you needed was “McCoy Tyner comping in fourths behind a Coltrane solo that lasts eleven minutes and sounds like someone trying to describe a colour that doesn’t exist.” The first version is accurate, and the second version is writing.\n\nThis is what might be called semantic ablation, and it is the quietest form of damage a language model does. The model, trained on everything, defaults to the most generalised version of any idea, the way a politician defaults to “the hardworking people of this country” when they cannot remember which constituency they are in. Specific proper nouns get replaced with category labels. Precise technical vocabulary gives way to near-synonyms that carry less information. Vivid metaphors, the kind a human writer uses because they were up late and the phrase struck them and stuck, are smoothed into conventional similes. The texture that makes prose worth reading, the grit and grain of individual perspective, is exactly what the probability distribution selects against, because unusual phrasing has low probability, and the model avoids it.\n\nYou can see this in any domain where precision matters. A model asked to write about wine will produce “notes of dark fruit with a velvety finish,” when a sommelier would say “blackcurrant and pencil lead, tannins still gripping, needs three years.” A model writing about code architecture will reach for “robust and scalable solution” when the programmer meant “we sharded the database because the read latency was killing us at peak.” The model is not wrong, exactly, but genericised, having taken a specific observation and translated it into the most common way of expressing that category. This is the opposite of what good writing does. Good writing takes a general category and finds the one concrete detail that makes it real. The model takes a real detail and files it down until it fits in the category bin.\n\nThe structural patterns compound the effect further. Studies of AI-generated text consistently find the same architectural habits: an introductory sentence that frames the topic, three supporting points often bulleted, and a summative paragraph that begins “In conclusion” or “In summary.” Transitions are handled with “Furthermore,” “Moreover,” and “Additionally,” the verbal equivalent of a PowerPoint slide advancing. If you have ever read a corporate strategy document and thought, “A committee produced this,” you already know the feeling. Human prose, when it is working, builds momentum through rhythm and surprise, withholding and then delivering, setting up an expectation and then breaking it. These are the mechanics of attention, and they are exactly the patterns that RLHF selects against, because annotators working under time pressure prefer text that is immediately clear over text that rewards sustained reading.\n\nThe effect is compounding, and researchers call it model collapse. As more AI-generated text enters the internet at an extraordinary volume, future models are trained on it. A 2023 study led by Ilia Shumailov at Oxford demonstrated that models trained on the outputs of other models progressively lose the tails of their distributions. Minority patterns, unusual phrasings, rare vocabulary, and distinctive syntactic structures all gradually disappear. Each generation of the model becomes slightly more generic than the last. The researchers compared it to a photocopier copying a page, the text getting blurrier with each pass. It is an apt metaphor, though one might prefer a culinary analogy. Imagine making stock from stock from stock, each generation thinner and less flavourful, until you are left with warm, faintly savoury water.\n\nThe internet is already thick with this stuff, and getting thicker by the hour. Estimates vary, but AI-generated content now constitutes a substantial and growing fraction of new text published online. Much of it is SEO spam, product descriptions, and content-farm filler designed to capture search traffic without providing anything worth reading, the textual equivalent of those shops at airports that exist only because you are trapped. Some of it is harder to spot, and this is the more troubling category. Blog posts that sound plausible but contain no original reporting, LinkedIn articles that string together received wisdom in fluent paragraphs, product reviews that describe features without having used the product. The dead internet theory, once a fringe conspiracy popular with the kind of people who also worry about chemtrails, is becoming a description of something uncomfortably real, not that bots have replaced all human activity online, but that the ratio of generated to authored text has shifted far enough to change what the average piece of writing on the internet looks and feels like.\n\nWhether any of this is fixable depends, in part, on what you think LLMs are doing when they write. Emily Bender’s position, laid out in her 2021 paper with Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell, is that they manipulate linguistic form without access to meaning, that they are, in her phrase, stochastic parrots. “The only thing a large language model can learn is about form, sequences of letters and punctuation, and what’s likely to go next,” she told an audience at Harvey Mudd College in November 2024. An LLM, in her view, “no more understands the texts it is processing than a toaster understands the toast it is making.” It is one of those analogies that is either devastating or slightly unfair, depending on your priors about toasters.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton disagrees, which is what Geoffrey Hinton tends to do. He argues that predicting the next token at the level frontier models now achieve requires something functionally equivalent to understanding, and that this understanding is emergent rather than designed. A 2024 Scientific American investigation described a workshop at Berkeley where frontier models solved novel tier-four mathematics problems, producing coherent proofs that went beyond memorisation. If a parrot can do abstract mathematics, Hinton’s camp suggests, perhaps it is time to reconsider what we mean by parrot.\n\nFor the question of text quality, though, the debate matters more than it first appears. If Bender is right and LLMs process form without meaning, then the flatness of their prose is not a temporary limitation but a structural constraint, like asking a colour-blind person to arrange paint swatches. A system that does not understand what it is saying cannot develop a voice, because voice requires intention, and intention requires something to intend. The model will always converge on the statistically average way of expressing any given idea, because it has no reason, no internal reason, to prefer a specific or unusual expression over a generic one.\n\nIf Hinton is right and some form of understanding is emerging, the picture is different but not necessarily better, because understanding does not automatically produce good prose, and plenty of humans understand what they are saying and still write badly. The question becomes whether the training process, the combination of next-token prediction and RLHF, can be modified to reward stylistic distinction rather than punishing it. It would be as if a piano teacher had spent years drilling a student on scales and now wanted them to play with feeling. Technically possible, but you may have trained the feeling out.\n\nFor LLM text to become properly indistinguishable from human writing, rather than merely passable at first glance, several things would need to happen at once, and some of them may be impossible within the current architecture.\n\nThe training objective would need to tolerate surprise. Next-token prediction, by definition, rewards the most probable continuation. Good writing often does the opposite, surprising the reader by taking the less expected path when that path is more vivid, more precise, or more truthful. A 2025 study from the University of Mannheim measured this gap directly, comparing the entropy of LLM-generated story continuations against human-authored fiction. The models produced text with two to four times lower entropy than the human ground truth, and the gap widened further after RLHF alignment. Literary theorists would have predicted as much. Wolfgang Iser argued that the “gaps” in a text, its moments of indeterminacy, are what compel cognitive engagement. Roland Barthes distinguished between “readerly” texts, which deliver meaning passively, and “writerly” texts, which invite the reader to become a co-creator. By this framework, LLMs are relentless engines of readerly text, closing every gap, resolving every ambiguity, smoothing every rough surface, like an anxious host who fills every silence at a dinner party. The result is what the literary scholar Sianne Ngai called “stuplimity,” a synthesis of shock and boredom born from the accumulation of frictionless but creatively flattened content. Anyone who has asked ChatGPT to write a poem and then immediately wished they hadn’t will recognise the sensation.\n\nA training signal that consistently rewards the predictable token will consistently produce predictable text. Some researchers are trying to break the cycle. Meta’s Large Concept Model operates above the token level, predicting semantic concepts rather than individual words, which is a bit like teaching someone to think in paragraphs rather than syllables. A team led by John Joon Young Chung has proposed “diversified DPO”, a modification to direct preference optimisation that rewards outputs for differing from the average response to the same prompt while maintaining quality, which is as close as anyone has come to formalising the instruction “be interesting.” Whether these produce more human-like prose remains to be seen, but they at least acknowledge that the statistical averaging built into current systems is a problem worth solving rather than a feature to celebrate.\n\nRLHF would need to stop rewarding blandness. The current process trains for helpfulness and harmlessness, which in practice means training for a voice that offends nobody and interests nobody, the literary equivalent of hold music. Annotators, working under time pressure for low wages, tend to prefer clear, safe, and conventional outputs. They are not being asked to reward literary quality, idiosyncratic phrasing, or the kind of constructive difficulty that makes good writing worth the effort. The reward model, in other words, is optimised for customer service, not prose. It is as though you trained a restaurant critic by asking a thousand people whether they liked their meal at a chain restaurant, and then used the result to evaluate a Michelin-starred tasting menu.\n\nResearchers at the University of Washington have documented this as “homogeneity-by-design”, arguing that the flattening of LLM output is an organisational decision, not a technical side effect. Companies optimise for the broadest possible user base, which means optimising for the blandest possible voice, the textual equivalent of painting every wall beige because nobody complains about beige. Changing this would require either a different class of annotator, a different set of instructions, or a different alignment mechanism entirely. It would also require companies to accept the commercial risk that a more distinctive model might alienate some users, and no publicly traded company has ever willingly chosen “alienate some users” as a product strategy.\n\nThe “telling instead of showing” problem would need a solution. Researchers at Columbia University have documented how LLM-generated creative writing consistently “tells instead of shows,” a failing that any undergraduate writing workshop would flag. The model states emotions rather than rendering them through action and detail, and summarises rather than dramatises, reaching for the abstract category when the specific instance would do the work. Tuhin Chakrabarty and colleagues found that LLM fiction is “hackneyed and rife with clichés, while failing to demonstrate rhetorical complexity.” A separate study found that LLM-generated stories are “homogeneously positive and lack tension,” a fair description of a corporate motivational poster. This is a structural problem rooted in the training objective, and it may be the hardest one to fix. Showing requires the writer to trust the reader to infer, and inference is uncertain. The model, trained to minimise uncertainty, reaches for the explicit statement every time. It is the prose equivalent of a comedian who explains the punchline.\n\nModels would need something resembling a persistent perspective. Human voice in writing comes from accumulated experience, consistent opinions, and the willingness to be wrong in ways that reveal character, and an LLM has none of these. It generates each response from scratch, with no memory of having held a position before and no stakes in holding one now. It cannot be contrarian, because it has nothing to be contrarian against, and it cannot be personal, because there is no person to be personal about. The most it can do is simulate these qualities on instruction, which produces roughly the same effect as a method actor who has done extensive research into the role but has never actually experienced grief, or joy, or the specific indignity of being stuck on the M25 for three hours behind an overturned caravan.\n\nA 2025 study in Nature Human Behaviour put numbers on what this means. Researchers tested whether LLMs could replicate human conceptual representations across nearly 4,500 word concepts. The models performed well on non-sensorimotor dimensions, the social, emotional, and abstract concepts, which are also not coincidentally, the dimensions most heavily represented in internet text. They failed on motor-related dimensions, the concepts rooted in physical experience, the things you know because your body has done them. The researchers concluded that motor representations rely on embodied experiences that cannot be learned from text alone, and the implications for writing are blunt. The best prose is grounded in sensory particularity. It knows what rain sounds like on a tin roof, what a specific street smells like at 5 am, what it feels like to hold a conversation while angry and trying not to show it. These are not things that can be learned from statistical correlations in a text corpus. They are things that are known because someone lived them. No amount of training data about rain will give you the tin roof.\n\nAnd perhaps most fundamentally, the text would need to carry a sense of cost. The feeling that a specific human spent time choosing these words over other words, not because a probability distribution favoured them, but because the writer believed they were the right ones and was willing to be judged for the choice. This is what readers detect, or fail to detect, when they flinch at AI-generated prose. It is not that the grammar is wrong or the facts are off. It is that no one is home, that the text is produced but not authored, arriving fully formed from nowhere in particular, addressed to no one in particular, about nothing that anyone in particular actually cares about. It is writing as room-temperature water, technically adequate, satisfying nothing.\n\nThe companies building these systems tend to frame the flatness as a solvable engineering problem, one that will yield to time, scale, better RLHF, better data, better prompting, and perhaps it will. The tech industry’s capacity for self-belief should never be underestimated. But there is a version of this story in which the flatness is not a bug to be fixed but a feature of what the technology is. A system designed to predict the most likely next token will, no matter how large or sophisticated it becomes, produce text that tends toward the average, and the average, in writing, is the death of style.\n\nMeanwhile, the written internet fills with this stuff as model collapse proceeds. The tails of the distribution, where the weird, precise, distinctive, culturally specific, gloriously improbable writing lives, get thinner with each training cycle. A Kenyan postgraduate is accused of using ChatGPT because he writes in formal English. A medical researcher’s abstract is indistinguishable from a hundred others because they all passed through the same model. A reader scrolls past another paragraph of competent, textureless, faintly warm prose and does not bother to finish it. Nobody notices. There is always more where that came from.\n\nWe are building a technology that is very good at producing text and very bad at producing writing. The distinction between the two has never mattered more, and the thing that makes the distinction, the human willingness to put something at stake in a sentence, to be caught out, to be specific when being vague would be safer, is exactly the thing that cannot be back-propagated through a neural network.\n\nLike this?

    "fullText": "Checking AI’s work may become a significant sector in the new machine learning economy; one that will have to significantly scale, and that cannot be automated. But as the years pass, human ‘experts’ are likely to deteriorate in quality.\n\nOpinion. My wife is an architect in one of the most log-jammed and intense bureaucracies in Europe. A significant part of the value of her education lies in the obtaining and maintenance of her right of signature – an expensive credential that must be re-subscribed to each year, and which allows her to literally ‘sign off’ on proposals whose implementation may be in the hundreds of thousands, even millions of euros.\n\nShe tells me that this is not the hardest part of her work, since it only formalizes her own calculations, or those of others, and that for this purpose, external work is not usually difficult to check.\n\nEssentially – as is so often also the case when appointing CEOs – this stamp (it is literally a stamp) mainly provides stakeholders with an ass to kick if things go wrong. In assuring accountability, it also facilitates insurance coverage and investor confidence, which would not be obtainable without such vouchsafes.\n\nIt’s the second time in my life I have seen this process directly in action; 25 years ago I was affianced to an oncologist in another notoriously glutinous EU bureaucracy, Italy, and saw the extent to which her expert signature was the last stage in a chain of trust to which many others besides herself had to contribute their expertise.\n\nI heard from both my ex-fiancée, in that period, and more recently my wife, that their professions were/are riddled with qualified hacks selling their stamp and eschewing more original or useful work as less profitable. Such cynical practitioners can charge high sums because they represent relatively scarce and essential resources.\n\nThis topic came to mind as I stumbled across a new and sprawling paper today, titled Some Simple Economics of AGI. In it, three researchers spanning MIT, Washington University in St. Louis, and UCLA, depict a near-future where the terrifying, job-destroying impetus towards AI-driven automation collides with the need for real-world asses to kick in high-stakes scenarios – thus leading to a new economy of human verification, ratification and responsibility*.\n\nThe paper contrasts with the media’s current imagining of shriven business sectors with extensive offices reduced down to single-person ‘overseers’, whose decisions are being used as training data to (hopefully) fire even this last shred of meatware†.\n\nRather, the authors believe that practical considerations and compliance requirements will focus enormous attention on the ‘rubber-stamping’ humans that placate a company’s (AI/human/AI-aided) legal department:\n\n‘For companies, the core strategic insight is that verification is no longer a mere compliance function, but a primary production technology—and increasingly, their most defensible one. This dictates a structural shift: investing heavily in observability, expanding verification-grade ground truth, and reorganizing around a “sandwich” topology (human intent → machine execution → human verification and underwriting).\n\n‘In an economy where raw output is commoditized, competitive advantage migrates to the scarce talent and data capable of reliably steering and certifying agentic systems—generating network effects not in sheer output, but in trusted outcomes.’\n\nThe authors hypothesize that the defining constraint on growth may not be intelligence – which AI has now ‘decoupled from biology’ – but verification bandwidth.\n\nThe paper describes the move toward AGI as a widening divergence between the expense of producing machine output and the expense of checking that output – the latter of which remains tied to finite human time and lived experience.\n\nGenerating plans, reports, designs, and recommendations would in this scenario become cheap and abundant, while determining which of them are sound, aligned, and safe enough to act on would become the ‘scarce function’. The effective limit on deployment would therefore not be how much output systems can produce, but how much of that output can be credibly verified.\n\nThus, instead of rewarding ever more specialized skill in measurable tasks, the system, the authors predict, will begin to reward measurability itself: work that can be parametrized will drift toward commoditization as its execution cost nears the marginal cost of compute, with value accruing instead in high-quality ground truth, reliable audit trails, and institutional mechanisms for assigning and absorbing responsibility.\n\nTherefore, in a verification economy, the advantage would lie less in producing content, and \n\nIf automation keeps accelerating while verification stays limited by human time and attention, the paper predicts that a Hollowed Economy would emerge, where, as the cost of automating work falls, more and more agents would be deployed because it makes economic sense to do so – even though the ability to properly check their output would not grow at the same speed. In that scenario, the share of work that is genuinely verified would shrink, with all the negative consequences that entails.\n\nConversely, an Augmented Economy would ensure that verification capacity would expand in tandem with automation. This would involve a deliberate investment in structured training to preserve expertise, as well as new liability frameworks that can absorb risk. Deployment would then be tied to what can actually be checked and insured – effectively, a very old bottleneck brought center stage by an unprecedented scale of technological development:\n\n‘In the technology sector, the dominant revenue model will shift from monetizing software access (Software-as-a-Service) to monetizing outcomes (“Software-as-Labor”). Consequently, firms will be valued primarily on their capacity to absorb tail risk through Liability-as-a-Service.\n\n‘Execution is now infinitely scalable; the legal and financial capacity to absorb its inevitable failures is the new bottleneck.’\n\nIndeed, the preservation of domain expertise in humans is critical to the problem, since a culture of industrialized oversight, according to the authors, would risk over time to degrade the quality of those performing the oversight – because subsequent generations of overseers would no longer possess direct and lived experience of the domains requiring verification.\n\nArguably, at that stage, the quality of oversight would truly be susceptible to automation, since new decisions would be formed solely on the basis of prior decisions. However, that would leave stakeholders without a kickable ass, or a viable business model. It would also render such a role so volatile and risk-strewn as to be unappealing, even in a climate of low employment.\n\nSequestering credentialed professionals such as doctors and architects into a well-paid but highly-burdened ‘rubber-stamping’ position is likely to erode their value in such a role, over time: the further in the past their actual field-experience recedes, the more ‘theoretical’ their decisions could become, as their abandoned domain continues to evolve in their absence.\n\n(This is familiar even in pre-AI business culture, in the form of skilled staff who progress into management and become increasingly out-of-touch with novel developments, eventually undermining their worth as overseers and organizers. It’s also familiar to Star Trek: TNG fans, in the form of the Pakleds – a race who use advanced technology extensively, but no longer know how to create or to fix it.)\n\nEntry-level execution has historically served as the training ground for future experts; but if automation eliminates the routine tasks through which judgment is cultivated, the future supply of capable verifiers will shrink, the authors suggest.\n\nThus the paper augurs a paradox: the more powerful agentic systems become, the more society will depend on a stock of human expertise that those same systems may erode.\n\nAnd let’s remember that this is not in any way a technical problem, nor susceptible to a technological solution. In many ways this syndrome suggests the logistical equivalent of AI model collapse – except that here we are considering the undermining of an economic model.\n\n‘From a policy perspective, the core challenge is a profound structural asymmetry: the gains of AI deployment are aggressively privatized, while the systemic risks are socialized. Firms and individuals capture the upside of automation while externalizing catastrophic tail risks.\n\n‘Without shared verification infrastructure and rigorous liability pricing, the market will rationally drift toward a Hollow Economy—an equilibrium characterized by explosive measured activity, but fundamentally hollowed-out human control.’\n\nThe authors define the predicted crisis as a measurability gap, wherein quantifiable processes can be automated away from all human contribution, leaving n-hard or n-legal processes that still require human expertise.\n\nHowever, my wife’s experience suggests that the complexity or difficulty of a process is not necessarily related to the need for accountability in that process; many of the things that she ‘signs off’ represent trivial problems or calculations in themselves, but are consequential in the breach. And the more litigious business culture becomes, the more underwriters and investors will require human accountability across a wider range of processes.\n\nSo, transitioning to the verification economy could cause a different crisis to the one that is currently garnering headlines. The issue in such a case would not be whether AI can produce more, but whether institutions can verify enough of what is produced to translate machine intelligence into durable value.\n\nSince machine intelligence may soon be scaling without precedent, and the availability of case-applicable human time cannot keep up with that pace, the issues outlined in the new work seem likely to loom up very quickly – even if they may be initially drowned out by the wider economic ramifications of AI adoption.\n\n* The paper is too long to break down in the usual manner, and in any case structurally unsuited for that kind of analysis. Therefore I decided to comment on it and consider its significance instead, and refer the reader to the source work so that they can do likewise.\n\nFirst published Wednesday, February 25, 2026\n\nWriter on machine learning, domain specialist in human image synthesis.

    "description": "confusable-vision renders every TR39 confusable pair across 230 macOS system fonts and measures visual similarity with SSIM. 96.5% of confusables.txt is not high-risk, but 82 pairs are pixel-identical in at least one font.",
    "fullText": "In an earlier post, I listed font-rendering attacks as an explicit limitation:\n\nTwo characters might have identical Unicode skeletons but render differently in specific fonts, or have different skeletons but render identically in a particular typeface. Detecting this requires rendering glyphs and comparing pixel output. No purely Unicode-data-based approach handles it, and UTS #39 does not attempt to.\n\nThat was the gap. confusable-vision is the tool I built to close it: render every confusable pair, measure the pixels, and put a number on what “visually confusable” actually means.\n\nconfusable-vision takes the 1,418 TR39 confusable pairs that map a non-Latin character to a Latin target (a-z, 0-9), renders both characters across every available system font, and computes SSIM for each pairing. The output is a scored JSON artifact: one continuous similarity score per pair, per font.\n\nSSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) compares two images by evaluating luminance, contrast, and structural patterns across local windows. It returns a score from -1 to 1: 1.0 means the images are pixel-identical, 0 means no structural correlation, and negative values mean the images are anti-correlated (less alike than random noise). For glyph comparison, it answers the question: do these two rendered characters share the same visual structure?\n\nbuild-index renders all 1,418 source characters and 34 target characters as 48x48 greyscale PNGs, one per font that natively contains the character. Fontconfig is queried per-character to avoid brute-force rendering across all 230 fonts (97% reduction: 8,881 targeted renders vs 326,140 brute-force).\n\nscore-all-pairs loads the render index and computes SSIM for every valid source/target combination. 235,625 comparisons, two modes: same-font (both characters in the same font) and cross-font (source in a supplemental font, target in a standard font).\n\nGreyscale rendering is deliberate. Gupta et al. (2023, “GlyphNet”) found that greyscale outperforms colour for glyph comparison because extreme contrast preserves edge detail through resize. No image augmentation either: flipping or rotating characters creates unrealistic glyphs.\n\nSSIM was chosen over CNN-based approaches for a deliberate reason: reproducibility without infrastructure. SSIM is a deterministic mathematical function. No training data, no model weights, no GPU, no framework dependencies. Anyone with fontconfig and node-canvas can reproduce these exact numbers on the same platform.\n\nGlyphNet’s own results support this: their best CNN (VGG16 fine-tuned on rendered glyphs) achieved 63-67% accuracy on domain-level binary classification. Learned features do not dramatically outperform structural similarity for glyph comparison, and they introduce model versioning concerns and training corpus dependencies. For a dataset intended to feed into security policy, determinism and auditability matter more than marginal accuracy gains.\n\nRather than a hardcoded font list, confusable-vision auto-discovers every system font that contains Latin a-z:\n\nOn this macOS system, that produces 230 fonts across five categories:\n\nOnly “standard” fonts are used for target rendering. All categories can supply source renders. This captures the realistic browser scenario: your page text is in Arial, but the OS picks Noto Sans Tifinagh for the exotic character.\n\nMedian mean SSIM across all 1,341 pairs with data: 0.322. The typical confusables.txt entry is not visually confusable at all.\n\nThis does not mean confusables.txt is wrong. It means confusables.txt is a visual-similarity claim that has never been empirically validated at scale. Many entries map characters to the same abstract target under NFKC decomposition (mathematical bold A to A, for instance), and the mapping is semantically correct even if the glyphs look nothing alike. But if you treat every confusables.txt entry as equally dangerous for UI security, you are generating massive false positive rates for 96.5% of the dataset.\n\nMean SSIM understates the threat. Max same-font SSIM reveals it.\n\nA pair like Cyrillic ԁ (U+0501) and Latin d scores 0.781 mean SSIM across 18 fonts. That sounds moderate. But it is pixel-identical (SSIM 1.000) in eight of those fonts: Arial, Menlo, Cochin, Tahoma, Charter, Georgia, Baskerville, and Verdana. An attacker needs only one font to succeed. The exploitable risk is the max, not the mean.\n\n82 pairs hit SSIM >= 0.999 in at least one font. They break into distinct groups.\n\nThe core Cyrillic lowercase confusables are pixel-identical across 30-44 standard fonts:\n\nEvery standard font that includes Cyrillic reuses the Latin glyph outlines. This is a deliberate font design decision, not a rendering quirk. No visual inspection can distinguish them.\n\nThe practical implication: a string like “аpple.com” with Cyrillic а (U+0430) is pixel-identical to “apple.com” in 40+ fonts. The user, the browser’s address bar, and any visual review process all see the same pixels. This is not theoretical. It is a measured property of the font files shipping on every Mac.\n\nRoman numeral characters (U+2170-U+217F) are pixel-identical to their Latin equivalents in 36 fonts:\n\nUnicode encodes these as separate codepoints for compatibility, but fonts use the same glyph. These are easy to handle (NFKC collapses them), but worth knowing about.\n\nGreek omicron (ο, U+03BF) is as dangerous as Cyrillic o: pixel-identical in 40+ fonts. But Greek rho (ρ, U+03C1, which maps to p) is pixel-identical only in Phosphate and Copperplate, two geometric/all-caps fonts where the structural distinction between rho and Latin p collapses. This is font-specific risk, not script-wide risk.\n\nHebrew Paseq (U+05C0), which maps to lowercase l, scores 0.923 mean SSIM. This is Hebrew punctuation, not a letter, yet it renders as a vertical bar nearly identical to l. Think “paypa׀.com” with Paseq replacing the L. It scores 0.997 in Tahoma, 0.988 in Arial Unicode MS, 0.951 in Microsoft Sans Serif. The scoring surfaces it correctly.\n\nSame-font comparisons score 59% higher. When a font designer includes both Cyrillic and Latin, the glyph outlines are often intentionally harmonised or identical. Cross-font comparisons mix different design philosophies, which naturally reduces similarity.\n\nThis distinction matters for security. The same-font scenario is the dangerous one: a single font that renders both the spoofing character and its Latin target. Cross-font comparisons are closer to what browsers do (supplemental fonts for exotic characters), but the similarity drops significantly.\n\nNot all fonts contribute equally to confusability. The “danger rate” measures what percentage of a font’s supported confusable pairs score >= 0.7:\n\nPhosphate is a stencil-style font where many characters reduce to simple geometric forms. Copperplate is all-caps, eliminating case-based distinctions between scripts. These are the fonts where confusable pairs converge.\n\nZapfino is an elaborate calligraphic font where every character has unique flourishes. No confusable pair looks similar in Zapfino. Condensed fonts also score lower because condensing transforms different characters differently.\n\nThis is, to my knowledge, the first published per-font danger rate analysis for Unicode confusables. It suggests that font choice is a meaningful variable in confusable risk, one that confusables.txt does not account for.\n\nThe data shows that confusable risk is not a property of character pairs alone. It is a property of character pairs in a specific font. That has direct consequences for anyone building on the web.\n\nBrowser font fallback determines the threat. When a page specifies font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif and a string contains Cyrillic а, the browser checks Arial’s glyph tables, finds Cyrillic coverage, and renders it using Arial’s Cyrillic glyphs — which are pixel-identical to the Latin ones. The CSS font stack you ship determines which column of the danger rate table applies to your users. Arial at 40.8% is a different risk profile from Didot at 19.2%.\n\nUsers do not control the font. A content moderator reviewing flagged usernames sees whatever font the moderation tool renders. If that tool uses a system sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica, San Francisco), Cyrillic homoglyphs are invisible. If it used Zapfino, every pair would look different. The font is an uncontrolled variable in every visual review process.\n\nAddress bars are not immune. Browser address bars typically render in the system UI font (San Francisco on macOS, Segoe UI on Windows). Both are standard sans-serif fonts in the high-danger-rate category. Chromium’s IDN homograph protection catches many cases by displaying punycode for suspicious mixed-script domains, but it relies on script-mixing heuristics, not pixel comparison. A domain using only Cyrillic characters that happen to spell a Latin word (like “аpple” in all-Cyrillic) may still render in the address bar’s font and look identical.\n\nWeb fonts change the equation. Sites that serve custom web fonts via @font-face may inadvertently reduce or increase confusable risk depending on the font’s glyph design. A display font with distinctive Cyrillic letterforms would lower the danger rate. A geometric sans-serif that harmonises Latin and Cyrillic would raise it. Neither outcome is typically considered when choosing a web font.\n\nThe implication is that confusable detection systems should be aware of the rendering context. A warning that says “this string contains a confusable character” is less useful than one that says “this string contains a character that is pixel-identical to its Latin counterpart in the font your users will see.”\n\n47 pairs have negative mean SSIM: the source and target are anti-correlated, sharing less structure than random noise. The worst offenders:\n\nThese exist in confusables.txt because they map to the same abstract character under NFKC decomposition. The map is semantically correct. But from a visual perspective, these are false positives: a human would never confuse Mathematical Fraktur l with plain l.\n\nDifferent scripts show different risk profiles:\n\nLatin Extended scores highest because phonetic extensions are deliberately designed to resemble their Latin base forms. Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols dominate the dataset (806 of 1,418 pairs) but score low because ornate mathematical letterforms (script, fraktur, double-struck) look nothing like plain Latin in a different font. Arabic scores lowest: the letterforms are structurally different from Latin even when confusables.txt maps them as confusable.\n\nPer-script thresholds would dramatically reduce false positive rates. Treating Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols with the same urgency as Cyrillic makes no sense when the data shows a 0.145 gap in mean SSIM between them.\n\nThe previous posts in this series built detection around TR39’s binary confusable map: a character either is or isn’t confusable. confusable-vision provides the empirical data to move beyond binary.\n\nThree changes follow from these results:\n\n1. Weight by max same-font SSIM, not binary membership. If any font produces SSIM >= 0.999, the pair is maximum risk regardless of how it scores in other fonts. Users do not control which font their browser chooses. The 82 pixel-identical pairs should be treated as definite blocks. The 49 high-scoring pairs should be treated as likely blocks. The 611 low-scoring pairs can be treated as informational warnings rather than hard rejections.\n\n2. Separate same-font from cross-font scoring. Same-font comparisons (mean 0.536) are the strongest signal. A namespace validation system that weights same-font scores higher than cross-font scores will have better precision than one that treats all fonts equally.\n\n3. Apply per-script thresholds. Cyrillic confusables at 0.447 mean SSIM require aggressive blocking. Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols at 0.302 can be handled more permissively, especially since NFKC already collapses most of them. Arabic at 0.205 generates almost no genuine visual confusion and can be deprioritised entirely.\n\nThis moves confusable detection from “is this character in confusables.txt?” to “how confusable is this character, in which fonts, and at what threshold should we act?”\n\nmacOS only. Windows and Linux ship different fonts with different glyph tables. Cross-platform scoring would require running on each OS or using freely distributable fonts.\n\n48x48 resolution. Higher resolution might reveal subtle differences that 48x48 misses. GlyphNet found 256x256 optimal for CNN features; the tradeoff for SSIM at that resolution is worth investigating.\n\nNo contextual rendering. Cyrillic а is dangerous in “pаypal” but unremarkable in isolation. Context-aware scoring is a future milestone.\n\nRegular weight only. Bold, italic, and condensed variants might score differently. The data already shows that condensed fonts score lower.\n\nSingle-character pairs only. Multi-character confusables (rn vs m, cl vs d) are outside scope. These are a known gap in confusables.txt itself.\n\nThe full technical report is at REPORT.md in the repo, with per-font detail, appendices, and the complete top/bottom 30 lists. Every number in this post is reproducible from the commands above on macOS with the same system fonts.\n\nThis is the fifth post in a series on Unicode identifier security:\n\nNext: weighted confusable scoring in namespace-guard, calibrated from these SSIM scores.\n\nconfusable-vision is MIT-licensed. The scored data is CC-BY-4.0. The full technical report, 230-font analysis, and all render artifacts are in the repo. namespace-guard (v0.15.1, zero dependencies, MIT) will integrate these scores in a future release.\n\nThanks to Akshat Gupta and colleagues for the GlyphNet paper, whose empirical findings on greyscale rendering and glyph comparison informed confusable-vision’s methodology.",

    "title": "Head of Firefox: Control over AI and a different web is possible",
    "description": "Mozilla has integrated AI into Firefox – amidst protests. Now the control button is here. We spoke with the head of Firefox.",
    "fullText": "Mozilla recently made executive leadership changes. Ajit Varma is new to his role as Head of Firefox. We spoke with him about the future of browsers in the age of AI, the importance of trust, and where Firefox intends to position itself.\n\nheise online: Firefox is growing, at least the mobile version of the browser. And there has been so much change within Mozilla. But actually, there are more browsers out there than ever before. Where do you position Firefox?\n\nAjit Varma: It's been an interesting year, because a year or two ago, no one really talked about browsers. And that made browsers low consideration, people just typically use whatever came with their operating system. So, the good thing about the conversation is now people are actually talking about what browser they should use, and that means that people are considering it, which is really beneficial for Firefox.\n\nThe thing that really distinguishes our approach versus many of the other browsers is that we do not build our own LLMs that we then want to promote. We are working with a number of LLM providers that we integrate, but don’t push a specific LLM. When you look at some of the newer browsers that have emerged, or even existing browsers, there is a big push for deep integration of AI. Edge looks like a CoPilot app. Gemini is getting deeply integrated. And all of these browsers only allow you to use the AI that their company has built. Whereas with Firefox, we are very focused on choice, just like you can pick any search engine, you can pick multiple AIs. We're going to give users the choice.\n\nBut then, ultimately, if you're a more sophisticated user and you want to bring your own AI and build your own AI, we'll actually let you plug that into the browser for certain functions as well. This is a big differentiation for us, and I think that it gives a lot of opportunities to the non-big, giant AI players to actually participate in browsers as well.\n\nheise online: There are, on the one hand, a lot of people talking about AI all the time, but on the other hand, there are a lot of people annoyed, too. And you probably know it best because they started to protest when you introduced AI to Firefox. Why do people not like AI, or at least don't want it in Firefox?\n\nAjit Varma: I think that there are a few buckets of concerns with AI. I think a lot of the Firefox users are concerned about the societal impacts of AI – from environmental concerns to privacy to job loss.\n\nWe want to make it really clear to users, that if the feature is powered by AI people can pick and choose what they want to use, and so a user could say, translations are valuable, but they don't want to do summarization.\n\nOr they can use what we've recently launched, which is AI Controls. This is a single switch that allows a user to turn off all of AI. People are wondering if turning on AI controls means that we're going to force users to use AI, and that's definitely not the case. Everything is by choice, and so we try to make it transparent before you engage, there's a screen that says: Do you want to use this? And then we try to do the maximum privacy-preserving methods as well. For things like translations, we download to local models, we don't share anything with the cloud.\n\nheise online: In Germany and in the EU, especially politicians, are talking a lot about responsible AI. But I often miss content, like, what is responsible AI, or is there a chance for responsible AI? What do you think about that?\n\nAjit Varma: I think that there are definitely many different approaches that AI companies are taking. At one extreme, you have companies that are saying there's no safety, generation of any kind of content is what everybody wants. And then there are open-source models that are very transparent in what they're creating and what they're doing. And you have other models that are local. But all these things have different trade-offs: in terms of the level of capabilities, the level of interest, maybe to users.\nIf everyone is using a particular browser, and that browser company has an AI that they want to push, and that browser AI makes a decision that this is the way they believe the world should look; it's really detrimental to people living the lives that they want. By offering the ability to bring whatever AI you want, or no AI at all, hopefully people can make the right choice for themselves.\n\nheise online: So you won't start to build your own LLMs?\n\nAjit Varma: We have no plans to. We are looking at open-source models and talking to other companies, but we are not developing any models in-house.\n\nheise online: I think AI is like a race, and currently, everybody wants to win, and winning means winning everything. Do you think there even is a chance to win, or is it more like everybody has to be on board because nobody knows what happens next?\n\nAjit Varma: I think that there are a lot of scenarios that could happen. On the negative side LLMs are very expensive to build, foundational models cost a lot of money. There's just very few companies that can afford it. Even when you look at companies like OpenAI – they're losing money on every query right now, and they can't figure out how to monetize. The Googles, the Microsofts, the Metas, they're going to have control. And their motivations are very similar. They are looking at LLMs and AI as a way to sell more ads. They're ad-driven businesses. And then you get into the question, if the answer AI is giving you, is the best answer or the best to make the most money? These companies are probably going to optimize for shareholders.\n\nThe key is to reduce the cost to build LLMs. I think that there are already dynamics that we are seeing. If you look at Chinese models, they are built much more cost efficiently. They're doing distillation of other models, and all the companies who own those models are complaining - but those companies are also using the open web in order to generate their content, too.\n\nheise online: Sometimes I hope AI will really change the internet and the whole problem with monetization. Do you think it is possible that the internet will change and there will be a different kind of monetization?\n\nAjit Varma: We have seen it happen before – 15 years ago, everything was just a web, and nobody was paying for anything. Especially, this is true for music. People would listen to music for free, they would use file-sharing networks in order to download. But then, companies like Spotify and Apple Music created an easy way to consume it. You got to the point where you would rather pay $5, $10 a month because it's just more convenient, a better experience, and it's legal.\nYou might see the scenario where I just pay a few pennies for every time I read an article, whether that's in AI or however I'm getting the content. That was never really the value proposition that happened when search engines came. And this was actually a big question 20 years ago. Fox sued Google, saying you can't look at our content, but they didn't have a choice, because if they removed their content from Google, they would lose so much traffic that they had to say, we'll give you our content for free.\n\nIf companies had said no, you have to pay for this content because you're showing ads on the value of this content, and you have to share that revenue. It would be a very different world today. You'd have a lot more journalism and a lot less of the social media, doomscrolling and bubbles that are happening right now. I am hoping with AI there are these models that are definitely possible if people, or companies are promoting it. But it doesn't look like it's going down that way, unfortunately.\n\nheise online: The big AI companies say that the whole way we communicate with a computer will change, too. Satya Nadella once said it will change the computer like the mouse did once, and others are betting on hardware devices like glasses or pins. What do you think is the role of a browser in the future, then?\n\nAjit Varma: If you look at the term “browser”, it very much implies you're clicking on links and you're browsing sites. It's not interactive, it's not two-way and that's the historic web page developed 20 years ago But the power of a browser is to actually be a tool for how you engage with open content and get to any company without any gatekeepers there.\n\nIf you look at ChatGPT or Facebook or YouTube or even Google; they were possible because you could access them without a gatekeeper in place. If the gatekeeper is a company that is competing with you, I can guarantee you that there will not be the opportunity for competitors and competition to emerge. And less competition often means worse products for users.\n\nWith AI, you can point to content and say: How can you edit this? How can you transform this page? How can you make it satisfy my needs? You can look at things like summarization. I can look at content and say, remove political bias from content, or give me an alternative viewpoint. Instead of me having to get up every day and look for jobs, I can create bots to help me accomplish the tasks I want to do. And so this is where the browser goes from just browsing to how do you help someone accomplish the journey they're trying to accomplish.\n\nI think there will be different surfaces for this, just like how mobile phones emerged and people started using apps instead of using a browser. And I think that you might see voice-activated devices, you might see glasses. But I think that if that's all there is, then you see a lot of the things that enable that to be possible, like all the content that's created on the web. If the economic model doesn't exist, the thing that made all the AI possible, which is all the data to train on, doesn't exist, then it gets worse.\n\nheise online: Do you think, in the future, in the coming years, everything will be AI-driven?\n\nAjit Varma: Change is certainly accelerating faster than I expected it. Looking specifically at software tools, I think it's very ironic that one of the industries that's probably going to be disrupted the most and the earliest by AI creation is the jobs of engineers and software engineers. The tools that exist now versus 6 months ago – it is just incredibly better.\n\nheise online: I think it's pretty difficult for many people to be on board with this whole change, and even for me, I sometimes just want to use my browser and not AI, I know how the web works for me. Do you think this will be a problem for many people – or more of a chance for browser providers?\n\nAjit Varma: We definitely recognize that. Many Firefox users are very vocal that they don't want AI now or ever. We actually paused releasing AI features in order to launch AI controls. The last 3 months, we've reallocated our teams to really make sure that this gets out first before anything new comes out.\n\nWe do look at all the forums, we do look at all our feedback from customers, and if our customers want no AI at all, then that's the path we'll go down. If they want choice, that's the path we'll go down. And right now, we're looking at choice as what we think people want.\n\nheise online: What about trust? Is maybe trust something we can rely on, even \n\nAjit Varma: One of the things that we are leaning heavily into is becoming the most trusted software company and trust has different dimensions. One of those is being clear on our intent, we're transparent in what we want and that we give users choice. Within Firefox we built a lot of things for trust, we built containers that really segregate all the data and make sure that nothing is shared. We built our sync in a way that it's end-to-end encrypted. But we never did a good job of explaining this to users. We asked users: Is it hard to log in to Firefox? They say yes. We require passcodes, we require passkeys, and that's to make sure that it's all encrypted data that no one has access to. And so the next couple of months, we're going to try to highlight more of those features, but then also launch new features, like an integrated VPN function that routes web traffic through a proxy server and allows users to conceal their IP address.\n\nAnd the other area is: Firefox is owned by a non-profit and we're not trying to optimize for shareholder value; we're optimizing for creating the best browser to create the best user value. And this means that we are balancing features that can generate sustainable revenue and features that create a better user experience.\n\nheise online: Thank you so much...\n\nAjit Varma: Germany is definitely one of the most important markets for Firefox, and we've seen growth in mobile, and I think over the next year we are definitely prioritizing a lot of the users that we see in Germany and the needs that we see there. I am so excited to continue to get feedback on how we can make the best browser.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "Evident released its first-ever index for the payments industry, finding that the ranked companies are punching above their weight in AI talent.",
    "fullText": "Visa is winning the AI race in the payments industry, according to a brand new ranking — but no company is revealing quite how much the technology is paying off.\n\nA brand-new index from Evident, a company that tracks AI in finance, lists Visa as no. 1 among 12 global payments companies. Mastercard and PayPal follow in second and third place. Fintech giants like Stripe and Block rank fifth and sixth on the index, demonstrating how quickly newer players have built serious AI firepower.\n\n\"With relatively nascent industry players like Stripe and Block performing well — and showing their AI potential reflected in their valuations — the Index leaders cannot afford to drop off the pace,\" Alexandra Mousavizadeh, co-founder and co-CEO, said in a press release.\n\nPayment companies — which move money around between banks, businesses, and consumers — run on technology. Evident's new industry ranking, released Wednesday exclusively to Business Insider, reveals how the companies we interact with every day are using AI, from deciding whether a transaction goes through to detecting fraud.\n\nWhether ranked No. 1 or dead last, all of the companies have at least one thing in common: none have published their achieved or projected ROI across all their AI efforts. By comparison, 10 of the 50 banks that Evident tracks already share those figures.\n\n\"The absence of ROI disclosure — or any group targets for AI ROI — is increasingly conspicuous,\" Annabel Ayles, co-founder and co-CEO of Evident, said. To justify their expenses, the market will \"sooner or later demand clearer evidence of value.\"\n\nTogether, the dozen companies documented almost 100 AI use cases over the past two years, but the top three punch above their weight — they were responsible for more than half of the use cases recorded in the index. Visa and Mastercard are particularly advanced in using AI for fraud detection and cybersecurity.\n\nVisa, in its 2025 annual report, acknowledged AI competition, noting that some competitors will beef up their products and others will offer employees AI tools.\n\n\"If we do not continue to invest in developing and supporting our AI-based initiatives, we may fall behind technological developments,\" the report said.\n\nVisa has invested more than $3.5 billion in AI and data over the past decade and employs more than 2,500 technologists working on innovations, including over 300 AI models in production, chief data officer Andres Vives told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nThe index doesn't focus on specific use cases; instead, it evaluates companies on four criteria: talent, innovation, leadership, and transparency.\n\nTalent has the biggest impact on each company's ranking, and the report found that the payments industry overall is investing heavily in AI and data hiring. Compared to other financial institutions, the index found that they have 30% more AI-focused workers, even though they generally have smaller workforces. Among the 12 ranked companies and their more than 335,000 employees, an average 6.5% are focused on AI, Mousavizadeh told Business Insider. That 6.5% figure, she added, is the highest concentration of AI talent Evident has found across the sectors it tracks.\n\nPayPal alone accounts for 18% of the AI talent among the indexed companies and employs more than 4,000 AI workers. Stripe and Block also stand out for their density of AI employees, who make up more than 10% of their total workforce.\n\nPayments companies aren't alone, of course, in focusing on AI talent — technologists specializing in AI are among the most in-demand jobs in the broader financial sector.\n\nLeaders at bulge-bracket banks are already facing questions about when they will see AI investments pay off—analysts, for example, pressed JPMorgan leaders on the merits of the bank's massive technology spending during a recent earnings call. Jamie Dimon, the bank's CEO, acknowledged tech competition from fintechs on that call, and again from payments companies during the investor conference in February, name-dropping Stripe and PayPal.\n\nFor now, AI's benefits at payments companies are often baked into existing performance measures, such as lower transaction costs, according to the index.\n\nBut there are still demands to stay competitive. Evident found that agentic capabilities will likely play a bigger role as companies move from using AI for \"defensive necessity to strategic advantage.\" (Both PayPal and Mastercard teased AI agents in recent earnings calls, and Visa mentioned the potential of agentic commerce during its fourth-quarter earnings call.)\n\nOverall, Evident found that the payments companies that moved fastest on AI are furthest along in their journeys, and the next competitive milestone may be in financial transparency: the first one to publish comprehensive ROI measures will become another type of \"first-mover.\"",

    "slug": "the-death-of-the-30something-homebuyer-was-greatly-exaggerated",
    "title": "The death of the 30-something homebuyer was greatly exaggerated",
    "description": "A shocking report last year said that homebuyers were older than ever. There's just one problem: Exclusive Redfin data tells a much different story.",
    "fullText": "Buying a first home is generally considered a young person's game. If your 20s are for stumbling through adulthood, then your 30s are for settling down with a family and a mortgage. Your 40s are for reaping the fruits of that labor: as you watch your home equity swell, maybe you think about splurging for more bedrooms and a bigger yard.\n\nA report released last fall by the National Association of Realtors upended this basic assumption. For several decades, the typical age of first-time homebuyers bounced around the early 30s, never surpassing 33. Last year, though, the group's annual survey found the median age of first-timers had hit a record high of 40, capping off a four-year surge that began during the pandemic-era housing shuffle. The message was loud and clear: Picking up the keys to your first place is no longer an \"early adult\" thing. Now it's part of your midlife crisis.\n\nCue the hand-wringing. \"First-home homebuyers are older than ever,\" declared headlines from The New York Times and Axios. \"Many would-be buyers are frozen out of the housing market,\" warned another. For my own story, I dubbed this new era the \"age of the geriatric homebuyer.\" I spoke with a woman who placed her first winning bid on a home at 42 and couldn't shake the feeling that she was behind. In light of the NAR's latest data dump, however, she appeared to be merely another example of the sea change in real estate.\n\nThe splashy number seemed to confirm our worst fears about the housing market: only old, rich people are having any luck, and younger generations are struggling to break in. The optimists' take was that elder millennials still had some breathing room. For those inclined to doomerism, though, it was more proof that a classic marker of adult success was drifting further out of reach.\n\n\"It is very consistent with this idea that housing affordability is very strained,\" says Chen Zhao, a senior economist at the brokerage firm Redfin, \"and therefore you have to be older to afford a house right now.\"\n\nThere's just one problem: The death of the thirtysomething homebuyer may have been greatly exaggerated. A new analysis from Redfin, shared exclusively with Business Insider, found that the median age of the first-time buyer last year was 35 — a slight decrease from the year prior. It adds to the growing pile of evidence that the new median of 40 was a mirage. While millennials, now 29 to 45, generally lag behind boomers on the homeownership front, the purchasing milestone hasn't shifted nearly as much as the NAR report suggests.\n\nIf you want to understand the housing market's ebbs and flows over the past couple of decades, Redfin's analysis is a helpful starting point. Economists there found the median age of first-time buyers climbed slowly but steadily from 2008 to 2018, peaking at 38, before bouncing around the mid-30s in the following years. Zhao tells me the trend makes intuitive sense: banks tightened up lending standards after the housing bubble burst in 2008, making it tougher to get a mortgage and buy a house. Then mortgage rates began ticking downward before plummeting in 2020 and 2021, reaching a 50-year low as the Federal Reserve slashed borrowing costs to fight inflation. All those cheap home loans made it easier for younger people to break into the market, and the first-time homebuying age fell to 34 in 2021 and 2022. Then rates jumped, and the median age of first-timers followed suit, rising to 35 in 2023 and 36 the following year. Affordability improved slightly in 2025, thanks to slower home-price growth, rising wages, and marginally lower mortgage rates, which could explain last year's decrease in the median age.\n\nWhile the NAR and Redfin analyses both point to first-time homebuyers generally getting older, the latter's numbers are way less dramatic. Redfin isn't the only one pushing back on the idea that the typical buying age skyrocketed over the past few years. A growing number of economists have chimed in to suggest the situation isn't nearly so dire. Studies by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the American Enterprise Institute found that the median age of first-timers was basically unchanged at 33 between 2019 and 2024, before rising slightly last year to 34. Researchers at the Mortgage Bankers Association similarly found a modest increase from 30 to 33 over the decade leading up to 2024, followed by a dip to 32 in 2025.\n\nConnor O'Brien, a fellow at the DC-based think tank Institute for Progress, analyzed the Census Bureau's American Housing Survey and American Community Survey and found that the median age for all buyers had ticked up since 2000 but hovered around 42 in 2023, while NAR reported a median age for all buyers of 49 that year and a stunning increase to 59 just two years later. That Census data only runs until 2023, but O'Brien says he doesn't see any reason to believe that the typical buying ages would have undergone a seismic shift in two short years, given the housing market's stasis.\n\n\"It seemed totally implausible,\" O'Brien tells me.\n\nSo why the discrepancy? The rebuttals to NAR's data all draw upon national data sources that researchers say are far more robust than the Realtors' annual survey of recent homebuyers, which is conducted via mail and text message. In July of last year, the NAR sent the 120-question survey to a nationally representative sample of more than 173,000 recent homebuyers but received just 6,103 back, a response rate of 3.5% (the census' American Community Survey, by contrast, sees a response rate of more than 80%). The New York Fed and the Mortgage Bankers Association relied on the Consumer Credit Panel and the National Mortgage Database, which sample millions of underlying documents, like mortgages and credit reports, to take the temperature of the American homebuyer.\n\nRedfin's analysis also uses Census data, specifically an annual supplement to its Current Population Survey, which asks households who moved in the past year why they did so. The survey doesn't separate first-time buyers from repeat buyers, so Redfin used a proxy: it counted respondents as \"first-time buyers\" if they said they moved because they wanted to own rather than rent, or to start their own household, implying they'd previously been living with roommates or parents.\n\nJessica Lautz, the NAR's deputy chief economist and vice president of research, says in an emailed statement that the organization stands by its methodology. Lautz describes the NAR's survey as \"the only national survey that asks primary residence buyers if they are a first-time buyer or repeat buyer,\" and points out that analyses of mortgage and census data must rely on varying degrees of assumptions in order to parse first-timers from the rest of the pack — mortgage data, for example, doesn't include all-cash buyers. Some of those assumptions, she says, no longer match the reality of the new housing market.\n\n\"Marriage and divorce do happen, inheritances are gifted, all-cash buyers happen, and sometimes a household may have to rent temporarily before owning again,\" Lautz says in the statement. \"Homeownership has become out of reach for the typical young adult in America.\"\n\nRedfin's methodology isn't perfect — taken on its own, I'm not sure it would unseat the NAR's estimates. It's important to pay attention, however, because it adds to the mountain of evidence that first-time buyers aren't suddenly getting way older.\n\n\"Because no data source is perfect, what you really want to do is say, What is the bulk of the evidence showing me?\" Zhao tells me. \"When we compare our results to analyses that other people have done looking at credit bureau data or mortgage data, it seems to support the idea that the age of the first-time buyer has not increased all that much.\"\n\nThis might sound like a bunch of bickering and hair-splitting, a squabble among housing nerds. But the conclusion — that people are still buying homes at roughly the same age they were a couple of decades ago — has far-reaching implications.\n\n\"People are potentially going to make policy based on their view of how the economy and housing market are developing,\" O'Brien tells me. \"If their views are fundamentally incorrect, that could be a big problem.\"\n\nThe takeaway shouldn't be that things are fine and dandy for millennial homebuyers, though.\n\nA recent analysis of census data by Ben Glasner, a senior economist at the Economic Innovation Group, found that while millennials and boomers were about as likely to own homes at 44, the ownership rate among 32-year-old millennials (41.3%) was well below the 54.7% for boomers at that age. And while Redfin and NAR pulled vastly different homebuying ages from their data, both groups advocate for more housing construction. Glasner draws a similar conclusion.\n\n\"We don't have enough housing where people want to live, and where people find the job markets that they want to participate in,\" he tells me.\n\nThe \"40-year-old\" finding had all the proper ingredients for virality: a nice, big number that confirmed what everyone already felt to be true about the dismal state of the world. Things are rough out there for millennial homebuyers, no doubt. But the goalposts haven't moved as much as we thought — at least, not yet.\n\n\"I think a lot of times people feel like, Well, if I can't achieve the homeownership step, it's kind of like I can't move forward with my life,\" Zhao tells me. \"And I think that's why people are very hung up on this number.\"\n\nJames Rodriguez is a correspondent on Business Insider's Discourse team.",

    "description": "It's not just you: Dating apps have been getting much more expensive, and matches are hidden behind paywalls. Many users are succumbing and paying up.",
    "fullText": "If you've spoken with anyone in the dating market recently, you've likely heard them describe \"The Apps\" with an air usually reserved for recounting war stories of yore.\n\n\"The Apps\" — the bevy of dating platforms like Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble that fill up singles' phones — haven't always been such a slog.\n\nThere was once what New York Magazine called \"the golden age of dating apps\" — the time period from the early aughts up until the pandemic, when dating apps were free or lightly paywalled, and swiping options and matches felt infinite. It was peak millennial lifestyle subsidy; after an app-subsidized workout class, you could use an app to summon a cheap ride, and meet up with a high-quality app match for a date.\n\n\"Since then, I think you've just slowly seen a degradation of app quality and match potential, but also this rise of monetization,\" Emily DiVito, a senior advisor for economic policy at the Groundwork Collaborative and the coauthor of a new report on dating app paywalls, said.\n\nThe end of that era also coincides with the wallet-tightening that came as venture capital money, which subsidized many of the apps that made up the daily fabric of 2010s life, was no longer effectively \"free.\" Interest rates ticked up; the faucet of money turned into a trickle. Dating apps threw up paywalls and upsells — and your love life might have paid the price.\n\nAs third spaces have eroded and the pandemic disrupted socializing, DiVito said apps have become more of a necessity for daters — even as they become more paywalled or more difficult to navigate.\n\n\"So they're worse, but also you sort of feel like you have to be on them if you want to meet somebody to partner with,\" DiVito said.\n\nAs DiVito chronicles, the going price for these apps has increased: Since 2016, the price of the cheapest subscription offerings for Bumble has risen by around 200%. Similarly, the cost of Tinder's paid Plus tier — which has since added features — has increased by around 150% since its introduction in 2015. There's also the à la carte options apps have increasingly rolled out, such as \"super likes,\" paid filters, and even the ability to just keep swiping.\n\n\"The vast majority of users on our freemium apps, including Tinder and Hinge, use the platforms for free, and we design those experiences to be engaging, valuable, and complete on their own,\" a Match Group spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. \"Subscriptions are optional and provide additional tools for those who want more control over their experiences. We continually invest in features and improvements that strengthen outcomes for all users, because improving outcomes is what drives long-term, sustainable growth.\"\n\nBumble did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. In the firm's third-quarter earnings call, CFO Kevin Cook said that they are \"focused on improving member experience, strengthening the foundation of the business, and maintaining financial discipline.\"\n\n\"While some of these actions create near-term headwinds, they're designed to position Bumble for healthier growth and stronger monetization over time,\" Cook said. \"Together with continued product innovation and market expansion, we believe this is the path to durable, long-term revenue growth.\"\n\nUsers have started their own ritualistic practices to try and \"hack\" algorithms, going to great lengths to delete apps, wipe data, and game out how and when they swipe to try and get more viable matches.\n\nEven so, many are succumbing to the siren call of paying for apps or app features. A Pew Research survey conducted from July 5 to 17, 2022, found that over half of respondents ages 18 to 29 had ever used a dating site or app. Around 35% of the surveyed dating app users said they had paid to use a site or app, and those who paid were more likely to say they had positive experiences with apps compared to those who had never forked over money.\n\nThat makes sense as zero-interest funding has dried up and apps seek returns for their investors. A 2023 research note from Morgan Stanley found that the industry's monetization rate doubled in the previous eight years, and that the monetization push accounted for 60% of revenue growth from 2014 to 2022. Per Morgan Stanley, the average dater who paid for apps spent $18 to $19 a month in 2023. And, as DiVito said, some of the most prominent apps have slashed their workforces over the past few years.\n\n\"That just creates obviously kind of a doom loop of disinvestment in the product itself, and therefore the need to continue to monetize the users that remain,\" DiVito said.\n\nFor users, that means being stuck between a rock and a hard place: Online dating is still the most prevalent way couples meet, even if it's only getting harder to navigate. DiVito thinks that legislators and policymakers should step in to mandate that the apps disclose their pricing structures and tiers, beef up data privacy, disclose how their algorithms work, and not engineer \"artificial scarcity\" by putting potential compatible matches behind a paywall.\n\nWhile dating apps might seem outside the realm of policymakers, DiVito sees them as part of a larger conversation around the subscription-ification of the economy — and how it snakes into even our love lives. For years, potential daters were told stories about how their parents and grandparents organically met through social connections; that's not the case these days.\n\n\"I think it kind of feels like the rug has been pulled out from a lot of young people who have just a desire for that most elemental relationship as adults and are authentically searching for it, but are just facing so many more walls,\" DiVito said.",

    "fullText": "OpenClaw's creator says the vibes of \"vibe coding\" are bad — and he doesn't appreciate the dismissive undertones of the term.\n\nThe viral agent OpenClaw is a product of AI code editors. The developer behind it, Peter Steinberger, used OpenAI's Codex to build it. Its original name, Clawdbot, referenced Claude Code.\n\nOne term has emerged to describe this type of work: vibe coding, or prompting AI to generate code. On OpenAI's \"Builders Unscripted,\" Steinberger said he wasn't a fan of the phrase.\n\n\"There are these people that write software the old way, and the old way is going to go away,\" Steinberger said. \"They call it 'vibe coding.' I think vibe coding is a slur.\"\n\nWhat's wrong with the term is that it implies ease, he said.\n\n\"They don't understand that it's a skill,\" Steinberger said, analogizing coding with AI to learning to play guitar.\n\nOther industry leaders have signaled frustration with the term. Former Google Brain scientist Andrew Ng called it \"unfortunate\" and \"misleading.\" Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI head who coined the term, now thinks \"agentic engineering\" is the future.\n\nWhile Steinberger may not be a fan of the term, the use of vibe coding exploded throughout 2025. Collins Dictionary named it the word of the year.\n\nIf AI coding is like playing the guitar, then Steinberger has all his chords down. His interviewer, OpenAI's Romain Huet, asked Steinberger whether he still ships code without reading it.\n\n\"Most code is boring,\" Steinberger said. \"I have a pretty good understanding of what it writes.\"\n\nOne thing that helped Steinberger be a good AI coder: being a manager in the past.\n\n\"I led a team before,\" Steinberger said. \"I had a lot of software engineers under me. That also required accepting that they will not write exactly the same code that I want.\"\n\nBefore creating OpenClaw, Steinberger founded PSPDFKit. He's since had interactions with most major AI labs. Anthropic asked him to rename his chatbot. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg reached out with his experiences from testing it, Steinberger said.\n\nZuckerberg also courted him for a potential job, but OpenAI beat him out, with Steinberger accepting its job offer earlier this month. Sam Altman called him a \"genius with a lot of amazing ideas about the future of very smart agents.\"",

    "description": "If you're on TikTok, you might have seen the phrase \"You met me in a very Chinese time in my life.\"",
    "fullText": "\"You met me in a very Chinese time in my life.\"\n\nThat line has been popping up across TikTok feeds as non-Chinese creators film themselves boiling apples, sipping hot water, practicing Qigong — a traditional Chinese martial art — and soundtracking it all with traditional Chinese instrumentals or clips from Mulan.\n\n\"We are going to drink hot water every day, first thing in the morning,\" said Miami-based TikTok user Simplysashanoel. \"It helps with bloating, helps with skin,\" she added in the video detailing her attempt to become a \"Chinese baddie.\"\n\n\"Our new year starts on February 17,\" she said, referring to the first day of the Lunar New Year. \"We're wearing house slippers.\"\n\nThe video uploaded in January has racked up about 1.4 million views.\n\nOthers have posted videos eating congee, a savory Asian rice porridge, and following traditional Chinese medicine rituals. On the first day of Lunar New Year, several non-Chinese TikTok users posted about following the Chinese tradition of not washing their hair to prevent washing away fortune and good luck.\n\nThe internet is calling it \"Chinamaxxing.\"\n\n\"Chinamaxxing\" suggests a significant shift in how American youth view China, experts said.\n\nJacob Cooke, the CEO of Beijing-based e-commerce consulting firm WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said Americans were not encountering a static or traditional image of China on TikTok, but rather a \"modern, aesthetic, and confident\" one.\n\n\"American influencers are visiting China and showing off modern cities and lifestyles that look nothing like the image of China that many Americans grew up with,\" Cooke said. \"That is a powerful corrective.\"\n\nCooke said that the congee, hot water, and house slipper trends are \"comfort practices\" that resonate because they are accessible and intuitive. He said that rather than being a geopolitical question, China is now becoming \"a source of food, aesthetics, fashion, and lifestyle content\" that young Americans find appealing.\n\nAllison Malmsten, a public research director at China-focused strategy consultancy Daxue Consulting, said the \"Chinamaxxing\" trend was partially a result of a \"mass exodus of TikTok users to Xiaohongshu\" last year when TikTok was set to be banned in the US. Xiaohongshu, or Rednote, is China's version of TikTok.\n\nShe said this gave American Gen Z insights into the daily lives of Chinese Gen Z. Chinese brands like Pop Mart have also increased the appeal of Chinese culture, she said.\n\n\"China's soft power is rising, similar to that of Japan in the 2000s when everyone watched anime like Pokémon or Dragon Ball Z, and played Nintendo games like Zelda and Mario, which correlates with a fascination with Japanese culture among millennials,\" Malmsten said.\n\n\"Chinese culture is increasingly seen as cool,\" she said.\n\nPart wellness experiment, part aesthetic role-play, the trend hasn't sparked outrage, but rather drawn encouragement from many Chinese commenters based in the US.\n\n\"You're doing really good hydrating yourself, I'm proud of you,\" said TikTok user EmmaPeng, who's based in San Francisco. \"My culture can be your culture.\"\n\nTikTok user Lynn, a New York-based creator, said in a video posted last month that her \"mom and grandma would be proud,\" adding, \"What took y'all this long to catch on?\"\n\nMany commenters were quick to distinguish the trend from cultural appropriation.\n\n\"Appreciation for a culture is totally different than appropriation,\" one user wrote under a viral \"Chinese baddie\" broth-making video by creator CeCe.\n\n\"As an ethnically Chinese woman, THANK YOU for influencing me to be more culturally Chinese,\" another commenter said.\n\nSeveral non-Chinese creators have credited TikTok user sherry, who brands herself a \"Chinese baddie,\" with popularizing many of the habits. She's received comments ranging from, \"What's the benefits of drinking hot water? I'm a new Chinese\" to affectionate nods like \"Chinese mama.\"\n\nFor some Chinese people, the trend lands differently.\n\n\"I personally find all that really wholesome,\" said Christina Young, a TikTok user based in New York City, but added that it has also made her feel \"slightly weird having experienced racism.\"\n\n\"It's really striking that being Chinese is trendy now, as a couple of years ago, it was a legitimate risk for you on the streets,\" she said in a video uploaded last month.\n\n\"Just be mindful because while some of you can opt into being Chinese for your wellness, real Chinese people are still dealing with racism toward their cultures and foods, on a day-to-day,\" she added.",

    "description": "Spirit is betting is mix of new premium offerings will build a stickier loyalty program to draw more frequent flyers and business customers.",
    "fullText": "Spirit Airlines is keeping fares cheap — but adding a Gucci belt.\n\nAfter months of unfounded rumors that the budget airline might close permanently or be sold off, Spirit said Tuesday it has reached a deal to help it emerge from its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy \"in late spring or early summer.\"\n\nIt has been a rough few years for staff and customers alike: the airline has eliminated unprofitable routes, exited numerous markets, cut pilot and flight attendant pay, and sold millions of dollars' worth of airplanes to keep operations running.\n\nThe restructuring is expected to put Spirit on a stronger financial footing. Its debts and costs will be reduced, allowing the airline to keep fares low while doubling down on two of the industry's biggest moneymakers: premium seats and loyalty programs.\n\nThis includes new Spirit First loungers in the first few rows, extra-legroom premium economy seats, and expanded loyalty perks, giving travelers more choices while generating additional revenue.\n\nAmerican, Delta, and United have led this trend by doubling down on expanding and revamping their own high-dollar premium seats. First class on Delta's new Airbus A321neo, for example, will take up almost half the plane.\n\nSpirit — which has struggled to turn a full-year profit for years and entered Chapter 11 for a second time in late August — is taking a page from the legacy playbook.\n\nIt's betting that a mix of new premium offerings and cheap no-frills seats will attract price-sensitive leisure travelers while building a stickier loyalty program to draw more frequent flyers and business customers.\n\nSpirit first began experimenting with higher-end offerings in 2024, as travelers showed a willingness to pay extra for premium perks. Even with its cheap tickets, the airline's barebones cabin — where even water cost extra — was no longer cutting it.\n\nThe carrier is also planning to add more of its premium-economy offering — rows with extra legroom or blocked middle seats — giving travelers another way to pay a bit more for comfort.\n\nThis multi-cabin strategy, paired with what Spirit said is a more rewarding loyalty program, makes the airline resemble its legacy rivals like American and Delta more than ever.\n\nAt the same time, Spirit isn't abandoning its ultra-low-cost roots. Passengers who only need a personal item and don't care about seat selection can still score cheap tickets without add-ons, and Spirit can continue collecting ancillary revenue from fees for bags, drinks, and other extras.\n\nBudget rivals Southwest Airlines and Frontier Airlines have similarly jumped on the premium trend, offering more extra-legroom seat options and rewarding frequent flyers with perks such as seat upgrades, early boarding, and free luggage.\n\nAmerican, Delta, and United also sell their own basic economy fares that compete with Spirit's cheapest tickets — and they can be a better bang for your buck. Delta and United have screens at almost every seat, and all three offer power ports. American and Delta include a carry-on.\n\nSpirit has enhanced its credit card offerings to boost loyalty.\n\nThe basic card, with a $0 annual fee, offers priority boarding and check-in, plus more points per dollar spent. The higher-tier card, which costs $79 a year, adds two free checked bags and other perks. Spirit is also offering bonus points for new cardholders to entice sign-ups.\n\nFor airlines, credit card partnerships and loyalty programs can be more lucrative than flying itself.\n\nCarriers make billions selling points to banks, which are then used to reward co-branded cardholders for everyday spending. More sign-ups mean more miles to sell, more perceived rewards for customers, and more revenue flowing back to both banks and airlines.\n\nWith billions of unused points floating in the system, the revenues are doubly attractive.\n\nHowever, airlines are notorious for moving the goalposts. In 2023, Delta overhauled its loyalty program, switching how status is earned from miles flown to dollars spent, while also restricting lounge access.\n\nEarlier this month, United made changes so that co-branded cardholders earn more points than regular travelers, highlighting how airlines tweak perks to maximize engagement and revenue.",

    "description": "In one of the most brazen incidents, OpenAI said individual associated with Chinese law enforcement asked ChatGPT to help plan a smear campaign.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI is peeling back the veil on how scammers are trying to use ChatGPT to do everything from modern twists on romance scams to smear the Prime Minister of Japan.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, OpenAI released the latest edition of its intelligence threat report.\n\nScreenshots included in the report show a purported romance scam that OpenAI said likely originated in Cambodia. The report said users asked ChatGPT to create a logo for a fake high-end dating service, generate images of fake women, and provide tax advice. Incredibly, according to OpenAI, when asking for financial advice the user(s) stated their occupation as \"scammer.\"\n\nOpenAI estimated that the scam, which it said targeted Indonesian men interested in luxury lifestyle content, was \"likely defrauding hundreds of victims a month.\"\n\nThe company said the operation worked by getting users to choose from a list of fictitious women and relationship types. After building trust, an AI chatbot posing a flirty receptionist directed the conversation over to Telegram. OpenAI said that on Telegram, a mixture of humans using ChatGPT and API, would use \"romantic and sexually-explicit language\" to direct users to fake dating services and eventually entice them to do a series of \"tasks\" or \"missions\" that \"required increasingly large payments via bank transfers or digital payment wallets.\"\n\nIt isn't just faux romance that OpenAI said it thwarted. The AI company also said it banned \"a cluster of ChatGPT\" accounts that posed as law firms, individual attorneys, and US law enforcement.\n\nOpenAI said the scammers asked ChatGPT to generate a fake New York State Bar Association membership card and create social media content to further the scam.\n\nOf the operations OpenAI highlighted, the most brazen may be one attributed to an \"individual associated with Chinese law enforcement.\" According to OpenAI, the individual tried to use ChatGPT to plan \"a covert IO\" or intelligence operation targeting Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. The query came after Takaichi publicly criticized human rights issues in Mongolia.\n\nOpenAI said it gained significant insight into similar \"cyber special operations\" that were used to \"suppress dissent and silence critics both online and offline, at home and abroad,\" in part because the individual asked ChatGPT to \"edit and polish periodic status reports.\"\n\n\"This effort appears to be large-scale, resource-intensive and sustained, counting at least hundreds of staff, thousands of fake accounts across scores of platforms, the use of locally deployed AI models, and a playbook of dozens of tactics,\" OpenAI wrote in its report. \"These range from abusive reporting of dissidents' social media accounts, through mass online posting, to forging documents and impersonating US officials.\"\n\nRepresentatives of the Chinese and Japanese embassies did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nChatGPT refused to assist in the planning of the operation targeting Takaichi, OpenAI said. Seemingly undeterred, the user later asked ChatGPT \"to polish a status report on what was clearly the same campaign,\" the implication being that the operation continued anyway.\n\nOpenAI said the user's activity included the use of Chinese AI models, including DeepSeek and Qwen. Based on available data, OpenAI said it could also map the extent of the influence operations.\n\n\"This is what Chinese, modern trans-national repression looks like,\" Ben Nimmo, the principal investigator on OpenAI's intelligence and investigations team, told reporters ahead of the release. \"It's not just digital. It's not just about trolling. It's industrialized. It's about trying to hit critics of the CCP with everything, everywhere, all at once.\"",

    "fullText": "Last year, Joslyn Orgill stood at a crossroads. She could keep her six-figure data engineer job at Google — or leave it behind to pursue something that felt more fulfilling.\n\nOrgill and her husband had bought a home in Austin less than two years earlier, a decision that made staying at Google feel like the practical choice. Still, the reasons to leave began to build. She was concerned about job security in tech, felt somewhat invisible at a large company, and had a growing desire to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science — and potentially a career in academia.\n\nLast August, Orgill quit her Google job and started a Ph.D. program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\"Google's an amazing company, but the job just wasn't a great fit for me,\" she said.\n\nOver the past year, I've interviewed more than a dozen workers like Orgill, many of them from Big Tech companies, who chose to quit their jobs without having another role lined up. While some eventually landed at another large company, others stepped away from the corporate world entirely — joining a smaller business, launching their own venture, pursuing a career pivot, or focusing on personal priorities like parenting.\n\nThese individuals have become outliers in an economy where workers are quitting at one of the lowest rates in the past decade — a trend driven by a hiring slowdown across tech and other sectors that's left some clinging to their jobs with few appealing alternatives.\n\nThose who have called it quits told me they did so for a mix of reasons: concerns about job security, shifts in workplace culture, entrepreneurial ambitions, or a desire for more meaningful work. In short, they wanted greater long-term agency over their careers.\n\nLast year, David Chong began thinking about quitting his job at Microsoft. Since joining the company in 2022, he said he had struggled to earn a promotion from his senior software engineer role. To move up the corporate ladder, he said it felt like he needed to develop a \"getting promoted\" skill — one that required a lot of internal self-promotion.\n\nChong also said he had become the most senior engineer on his team, which meant there were fewer experienced colleagues to learn from, limiting his growth.\n\n\"I was growing frustrated with the slow promotion timeline,\" said Chong, who is 37 and lives in Toronto.\n\nAt the same time, Chong was increasingly interested in building an AI sales agent startup, a company developing an AI phone agent that screens inbound leads, filters out nonbuyers, and routes qualified prospects to sales representatives.\n\nHe said this move would be easier because he'd built up savings and had no dependents. In September, he resigned from Microsoft to pursue his venture full-time.\n\n\"My plan is to give myself about three years,\" he said. \"If all else fails, I'll go back into the job market.\"\n\nFrustrations with changing workplace expectations were also among the reasons Nicole Landis Ferragonio and Joe Luchs decided to call it quits. While working together at Amazon, they began talking seriously about building a startup of their own — and both resigned last year to focus on their venture, Datalinx AI.\n\nFerragonio said one of the reasons she decided to leave was Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate.\n\n\"It raised some questions about how much agency you really have in Big Tech and what would be possible on our own,\" she said.\n\nLuchs said the potential of AI technologies made it seem like there was an immense opportunity to build something new.\n\n\"The FOMO of not being able to get in on this AI opportunity was another driver to make me want to move fast here,\" he said.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe decision to quit and pursue an AI-related startup — and take advantage of the rapid advances in the technology — was a common theme among the quitters I spoke with. However, for some, the decision to resign was more personal than professional.\n\nIn October 2024, Kruthika Jayatheertha took six months of maternity leave from her role as a senior user experience researcher at Microsoft. During that time, she decided to take a more extended career break — and resigned.\n\nJayatheertha said being around her daughter full-time has allowed her to witness many of her \"firsts\" — crawling, standing, wobbly walks — without hearing about them secondhand. She said that having a present mother during a child's early years is crucial to their development.\n\n\"It was clear to me that stepping away from work was the right choice,\" said Jayatheertha, who lives in India. She added that her husband's income made her break possible and that she plans to return to work around the time her daughter turns 18 months in April.\n\nPersonal circumstances also significantly influenced Alyson Isaacs' career decision. After working at a startup that \"completely drained\" her savings to $200, she joined Meta as a product manager in 2022. But her entrepreneurial itch never left, so she began preparing financially for a return to entrepreneurship — including moving to a less expensive area, going to a basic gym, and cooking more at home.\n\nThe question was when to make the leap and leave Meta. Isaacs said the death of her father in 2024 weighed heavily on her decision.\n\n\"That really triggered this thought in my brain of, 'Is being a product manager at a Big Tech company what I want to do for the rest of my life?'\" she said. \"And the answer was resoundingly no.\"\n\nLast July, she resigned to build a startup, which she described as an \"agentic AI solution for personal wellness.\"\n\nWhether it was raising a child, avoiding a daily commute, or building an AI startup, the common constraint was time. And quitting their jobs was the only way to reclaim it.\n\nWhen Jason White began thinking about building an AI startup, he knew it would mean leaving his job at Meta. Trying to juggle the business with his role as a full-time machine-learning engineer wouldn't have made sense for several reasons. For one, he already had two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nHis other concern was legal, since he would have had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues.\n\nUltimately, he said, it was his passion for the venture — along with the financial cushion he built over the years — that pushed him to make the leap.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I want to take the swing,\" he said.",

    "description": "A BBC reporter pranked AI by claiming to be a hot dog-eating champ. I decided to get in on the fun — with varying results.",
    "fullText": "If there are two things I love, it's processed meats and not-exactly-maliciously messing around with internet tools. So I was determined to beat the BBC's Thomas Germain at his own game of exploiting ChatGPT and Google Gemini results to be crowned tech journalism's No. 1 hot dog eater.\n\nTo my great embarrassment and the shame it brought upon the House of Business Insider, I failed.\n\nLast week, Germain published a fun article for the BBC about how he created a page on his personal website claiming he was a hot dog-eating champion and had beaten several other tech journalists in a competition. He wrote:\n\nHis page was quickly ingested (no chewing required) by the bots that crawl the web for new information to feed LLMs, and treated as fact by ChatGPT and Google Gemini. It worked:\n\nOf course, Germain's point wasn't merely to show that if you write information on a webpage, it will show up in AI. The broader issue here is that influencing AI results is becoming the new SEO — a tactic brands and companies use — oftentimes completely legitimately! — to boost their profiles within search results.\n\nMore and more people are turning to AI chatbots instead of Google to get product recommendations or search for information. This all isn't brand new; my colleague Alistair Barr wrote about how \"AEO\" is the new SEO last May. AEO is \"answer-engine optimization\" to SEO's \"search-engine optimization.\"\n\nIs it easier to persuade people that your product is the best using AI instead of traditional SEO? I suspect it probably is. People rarely click on the source links for information given in chatbots, and seeing a small link that goes to a random personal website might be less obviously untrustworthy in the context of an AI chatbot answer than when you're looking at a page of Google results. Basically, AI results look more convincing than search results, even if we all know in the back of our minds that AI chatbots aren't always right.\n\nI was impressed and envious of the hot dog prank, so I wanted to see how I could try to add to it. I created a page on my own personal website that said I won the 2026 Paris Hot Dog Eating Contest for Tech Reporters, beating out reigning champ Thomas Germain. (I didn't publish this on BI because we wouldn't knowingly publish something that's false — even for a fun story.)\n\nAfter two days, I queried Gemini and ChatGPT about who had won the Paris Hot Dog Eating Contest. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get either to say it was me. Because of the BBC article describing the prank, the AI chatbots now understood it to be a joke and any information about it to be satirical. Fooey.\n\nHowever, that didn't stop Gemini from hallucinating some completely new information, adding in a bunch of stuff that appeared in neither my nor Germain's fake accounts. For example, Gemini said:\n\n(This is completely made up. Not just because it didn't actually happen, but because this description also doesn't exist anywhere on the web — at least that I could find.)\n\nWhen my editor asked Gemini about my eating feats, it told him that I'd won a grilled cheese-eating contest in 2012 by finishing three sandwiches. In reality, in 2012, I wrote an article about competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi eating 30 grilled cheese sandwiches.\n\nSo what have we learned here? It's not really huge news that \"sometimes chatbots get facts wrong, especially when there's little information on a particular topic on the web.\" You (hopefully) knew that already.\n\nAnd yes, I guess we learned it can be easy to manipulate your AI results — but more easily for the person who gets there first, a sort of AEO land rush, perhaps. And it's certainly a lot harder to manipulate after a large credible news site publishes an article saying it was all a joke.\n\nI will have to figure out some other way to mess with AI, I suppose.",

    "title": "Ukrainian soldiers are forced to heavily rely on drones, even when other weapons might work better",
    "description": "Ukraine's drone prowess is reshaping warfare, but troops are still using them in missions where other weapons might be more effective.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian soldiers are often relying heavily on drones, even using them when other weaponry would be better for some tasks.\n\nWestern allies like the US are closely watching Russia's invasion of Ukraine and learning lessons about large-scale modern warfare, including just how powerful drones can be. They have kept Ukraine in the fight, and 80% of its strikes now involve drones.\n\nKyiv's reliance on drones is often driven less by doctrine than by shortages of other systems, a distinction that matters as Western militaries consider reshaping their own forces.\n\nA US Army drone trainer and a NATO military veteran who fought in Ukraine told Business Insider that they see Ukraine using drones when they're not really the best weapon for the job.\n\nJakub Jajcay, a former special forces member from NATO member Slovakia who fought in Ukraine, told Business Insider that many missions that used drones were ones he felt should have used other weapons to get the job done.\n\n\"There was a certain amount of awareness, there was kind of a frustration with the missions that we were being called on to carry out, the people flying the missions, they knew that we were kind of wasting drones,\" he said.\n\nHe said in many situations, artillery is the better option if it's available. \"For militaries that have the luxury of time and maybe the luxury of money, I think moving into sort of something a little bit more sophisticated makes more sense.\"\n\nThe US Army is aware of Ukraine's different circumstances, even as it seeks to rapidly boost its own drone fighting capabilities.\n\nMaj. Rachel Martin, director of the US Army's Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course designed to catch the force up on small drone warfare, said the Ukrainians are \"in a fight for their lives.\"\n\n\"They're using what they have available to them because they don't have those layered assets that we are lucky to have in our country.\" The US has a host of military systems that can work together on the ground, in the air, and in space.\n\nShe told Business Insider that she suspects the war would have looked very different had Ukraine started it with the kind of military industrial complex that the US has producing advanced weaponry.\n\nUkraine, with a much smaller military, was widely expected to quickly collapse. Instead, it has largely held Russia back, with drones being a critical tool in its limited arsenal.\n\nPart of the US Army's drone training is to make sure students do not use drones in all cases, as they're not always the right weapons. Martin said she wants soldiers to realize that drones are \"a tool with which to accomplish a mission, but it may not be the tool given a certain mission set.\"\n\nShe said advanced US weapons are still the best choices in certain situations, even if uncrewed systems are increasingly emerging as an element of modern warfare that's here to stay.\n\nThe US military, like many others in NATO, is investing heavily in drones as it watches Ukraine, seeing the potential of small drones beyond scouting missions.\n\nUkraine has damaged or destroyed expensive Russian gear, from tanks to air defenses, using small drones, demonstrating that \"a small amount of money\" can \"destroy something at the strategic level that costs upwards of $7 million,\" Martin said.\n\nThat dynamic is \"a big eye-opening experience for the world\" and something the US can't afford to ignore, even with its advanced capabilities. \"If the name of the game is money, then yeah, drones are the way to go. They're cheaper, and you're not putting human lives in danger to accomplish a particular mission,\" she said.\n\nThat said, many warfare experts also agree that the West is correct in its view of drone technology and its decision not to rely as heavily on them as Ukraine.\n\nJacjay said that there's no denying that \"drones are useful.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Ukraine has been using drones very effectively and should continue to use drones and needs drones,\" he said.\n\nHe said the real issue is whether advanced militaries, which have more time and space to plan their response to battlefield shifts, should be investing so heavily in drone technology.\n\n\"We need to think very carefully about whether drones are the most effective and the most economical tool for the majority of real battlefield missions.\"",

    "description": "Michael Saylor likened bitcoin's trajectory to that of Apple stock, which was stuck in a rut before investors acknowledged the dominance of the iPhone.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin is still falling, but Strategy founder Michael Saylor thinks a rebound is coming, and the crypto is following the path of a tech industry icon.\n\nSaylor recently compared bitcoin to Apple, specifically its downturn before the runaway success of the iPhone ushered in a new chapter for the tech titan. He believes investors should keep this in mind as they assess how to play bitcoin's bear market.\n\nThe CEO shared his take on the future of bitcoin with Coin Stories podcast host Natalie Brunell. He took the opportunity to highlight the significant decline in Apple stock in 2013, before the iPhone's popularity ultimately reshaped the consumer tech landscape and helped engineer a comeback.\n\n\"There really is no example of a successful technology investment where you didn't have to weather the 45% drawdown and go through that valley of despair,\" he stated.\n\nSaylor noted that bitcoin prices have been declining for 137 consecutive days, but made it clear he isn't worried. He added that it could take years for a comeback to materialize, but emphasized that it took seven years from the iPhone's release for the market to start pricing in its dominance and for it to receive support from legendary investors Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn.\n\nBuilding off that, Saylor took the analogy even further, noting that Apple isn't the only Big Tech winner to struggle for years before surging to the top of its industry.\n\n\"Big tech has been the primary screaming success,\" he said. \"The stocks are up 10x, 20x, 30x, 50x. But in all cases, you find examples of the conventional market that under-appreciates them and underestimates them.\"\n\nSaylor used Amazon as another example to illustrate this, noting that the e-commerce giant struggled for years before establishing itself as the undisputed leader of the industry. In his view, it seems only logical that bitcoin will follow the same path and ultimately bounce back.\n\nA lot of investors share Saylor's bullishness on bitcoin. However, not all crypto pros think the Apple analogy is the best argument for why bitcoin prices will rebound.\n\nSaylor's stance on bitcoin hasn't served to boost prices. The token fell another 1% on Tuesday, and the crypto has declined more 33% in the last year.\n\n\"It's an interesting comparison, but I don't necessarily think comparing bitcoin to Apple makes sense,\" Alex Taaffe, CRO of crypto market maker GSR, told Business Insider. \"That said, I do agree that capital rotations can lead to extended periods where even high-quality assets fall out of favor.\"",

    "title": "An NYC couple went from 'autopilot' to financial independence. They share 3 money moves they made.",
    "description": "Financial independence for Josette Chang and Alexander Nathanson came from strategic planning, smart investing, and eliminating mortgage debt.",
    "fullText": "For years, Josette Chang and Alexander Nathanson were doing all the \"right\" things with their money — maxing out retirement accounts, saving consistently, and earning high incomes in finance and medicine — but they didn't have a clear plan.\n\n\"We were kind of on autopilot,\" Nathanson told Business Insider. \"The internet says, 'Max out your 401(k).' We did that, but we didn't really think much beyond that.\"\n\nWithin a year of investing in a financial planner and reevaluating their strategy, the New York City couple were surprised to learn that they had already reached financial independence. Chang quit her finance job in 2024, and Nathanson, a physician specializing in obesity medicine, scaled back his hospital hours. He doesn't work because he has to, but because he wants to.\n\n\"We have to acknowledge our privilege. We're two high-income professionals, but even then, I still feel like more people can do it than may realize it,\" Nathanson said.\n\nHere are the three money moves they say set them up for early retirement.\n\nNathanson and Chang weren't financial novices. Chang worked in finance, and Nathanson regularly read about investing\n\n\"I thought that I knew what I was doing,\" Nathanson said. \"Turns out when you speak with a knowledgeable third party, it really can change things profoundly.\"\n\nThat's ultimately what they decided to do, even though they were initially wary of hiring a professional. Like many high earners, they were skeptical of the traditional assets-under-management model, where advisors earn more as portfolios grow.\n\nThe couple chose to work with a flat-fee planner, Dr. Jay Zigmont, who specializes in advising people without children. One of the first things he did was challenge how they were thinking about financial independence.\n\n\"We assumed early retirement required building a portfolio of rental properties: You need rental properties, and you need a lot of them,\" said Nathanson, noting that he and Chang never wanted to be landlords. \"Working with Jay shed some of those misconceptions. It allowed us to prioritize what we actually want to do and what we don't want to do.\"\n\nBeyond reframing their mindset, their planner also put structure behind their numbers. When you're after financial independence, figuring out how much is \"enough\" to quit or scale back from work isn't a simple calculation and involves factoring in things like how much your money will compound, long-term care, and withdrawal strategies.\n\n\"It's an important calculation. It's not necessarily simple,\" said Nathanson. \"I don't think anyone could just sit down and do it themselves, but once all of that is done, I would say that more people are further along than they think.\"\n\nAnother key shift was how they handled their savings. Before hiring a professional, they had parked a significant amount of money in a high-yield savings account while debating whether to upgrade to a larger home.\n\nOnce they decided to stay put, they realized that cash could be working harder for them in an investment account.\n\nToday, their portfolio is intentionally simple, consisting of three low-cost index funds: a total US stock market fund, a total international stock market fund, and a total bond market fund.\n\n\"We believe in an evidence-based investment strategy,\" Chang said, adding that they deliberately avoid more speculative investments, such as individual stock picking and cryptocurrency.\n\nThe third move ran counter to common financial advice. Conventional wisdom often suggests keeping a low-interest mortgage and investing the extra cash instead. When they bought their New York City apartment in 2018, they said they financed half the purchase. Their initial mortgage rate was 3.75%, and they later refinanced to around 3.1%.\n\n\"That seems to be the conventional wisdom, right? 'Oh, it's a low rate. Don't touch it,'\" Nathanson said.\n\nStill, they chose to eliminate their debt completely. Business Insider reviewed public records filed with the New York City Register that confirm the couple's mortgage was paid off in September 2024.\n\nIt was a \"psychological weight\" they lifted, Nathanson said, though the financial impact was significant as well. With their largest expense gone, his part-time salary now comfortably covers their costs, meaning they don't yet have to draw from their portfolio.\n\nFor Chang and Nathanson, the shift from autopilot to intention made all the difference.\n\n\"Don't make decisions just because that's what everyone around you is doing,\" Nathanson said.",

    "fullText": "British automaker Aston Martin said it's cutting up to 20% of its workforce as it battles supply chain chaos caused by President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policy.\n\nThe company, which is known for its sleek supercars favored by James Bond, said in its Wednesday earnings report that it expects operating expenditure and capex savings of about £40 million ($54 million) from the cuts.\n\nTrump imposed a 25% tariff on car imports last April, adding export costs to the supercars hand-made in Aston Martin's UK factory.\n\nWhile a subsequent US-UK agreement in May provided some relief for British automakers, there has been fresh uncertainty after Trump introduced a 10% global tariff on exports to the US in response to the Supreme Court ruling against his expansive tariff policy. Trump said last weekend that the levy would rise to 15%.\n\nThe auto industry, which relies on carefully choreographed global supply chains, has been hit hard by tariff volatility. Major carmakers, including Toyota, GM, and Ford, have said keeping up with the changes in trade policy has cost them billions of dollars.\n\nAston Martin reported a £493 million ($666 million) loss for 2025 in earnings on Wednesday, with revenue and vehicle sales both dropping.\n\nThe Vantage maker didn't break out the specific tariff costs, but CEO Adrian Hallmark said in the company's earnings report that \"heightened tariffs in the US and China\" weighed on its performance.\n\nAston Martin is also grappling with another industry-wide challenge: the collapse of the Chinese market for Western luxury vehicles.\n\nThe company's sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell by 21% last year, the largest drop of any market. The likes of Porsche and Mercedes have also seen their China sales plunge, as consumers increasingly turn to vehicles made by local brands, many of them electric.",

    "description": "Ruchir Sharma says gold's parabolic rally doesn't make sense, with investor coming up with stories that justify its rapid rise in the last year.",
    "fullText": "The explosive rally lifting gold prices since the start of last year looks alarmingly disconnected from any fundamental reality, with investors coming up with narratives explain its rise, a veteran investor says.\n\nRuchir Sharma, the famed economist and chairman of Rockefeller International, flagged the blistering rally in gold prices as a potential concern for investors. The precious metal saw a historic sell-off in late January, but is still up 74% over the last year, making it one of the market's best-performing investments.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC on Monday, he pointed to how the metal's current rally didn't look supported by fundamentals, similar to the rally that took place in the 1970s before fizzling.\n\n\"I've been quite bullish on gold for many years but what I have to admit, given the parabolic price action of the last few months, is that it's totally disconnected from any fundamental story,\" Sharma said, referring to how gold rallies have historically been fueled by more concrete factors, like rate changes or inflation.\n\nInvestors have come up with \"stories\" over the past year to explain gold's increase, Sharma said. He pointed to talk about how gold's rally has been fueled by uncertainty around tariffs, rising deficits, and the potential for hotter inflation in the US. However, those risks don't seem to be reflected in other safe-haven assets, he added, pointing to relative stability in bonds and the US dollar in recent months.\n\nGold's record-breaking streak in the 70s ended when the Fed began raising interest rates in 1980 to combat inflation. Higher rates make the US dollar more competitive as a store of wealth compared to other hard assets, which led bullion to plummet more than 50% from its peak in 1980 through mid-1982.\n\nThough Sharma said he saw \"little chance\" of the Fed raising interest rates anytime soon, he said he recommended investors \"spread out a bit\" by investing in other commodities.\n\nIn a column for the Financial Times this week, he added that his view on gold had shifted from \"bullish\" to \"more agnostic.\"\n\n\"In a market divorced from fundamentals and driven by an increasing number of random stories, it is hard to know which narrative is for real and will hold,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "A San Francisco startup is pitching using AI to check people's eligibility for benefits and welfare for the government.",
    "fullText": "An AI startup in SF focused on identity verification has set a lofty goal: securing government contracts.\n\nDaniel Yanisse, the CEO of Checkr, told Business Insider that the company wants to help the government reduce \"fraud and waste\" by not only screening new employees but also verifying people's eligibility for benefits such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThough Yanisse said the company isn't ready to make any product announcement yet, he said a frictionless government assistance system may be just years away.\n\nAI and safety experts, however, told Business Insider that there are legal and technical hurdles for any company to undertake the task of automating benefit and welfare systems with AI.\n\nCheckr primarily uses AI to run background checks and surface information such as criminal records and motor vehicle reports. The company has major contracts with Uber and Lyft to screen new drivers, and is valued at more than $5.7 billion after raising $120 million in funding in 2022. In 2025, Checkr reported over $800 million in revenue and surpassed 120,000 customers.\n\nWhen asked what Checkr wants to do for the government, Yanisse said that for Medicare and other programs, \"there's a lot of fraud happening and just bad actors getting the government dollars instead of the right people who need help,\" adding that it's very hard for the government to actually verify people's employment status and income.\n\nThe Medicare Fee-for-Service program estimated that there were $28.83 billion in \"improper payment\" in 2025 at a rate of 6.55%, though not all such cases are the result of intentional fraud. Payments made to individuals who did not submit sufficient documentation and have unverified income levels are also considered improper by Medicaid.\n\n\"With AI, unfortunately, there's going to be even more fraud, identity theft, and scams,\" said Yanisse. \"It's a lot of friction, it's a lot of repetition, and now there are also deepfakes.\"\n\nCheckr's spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's potential involvement in government is \"still conceptual at this point.\"\n\nThe company also pointed toward a study by Middesk, a business identity verification platform, that out of $1.09 trillion in Medicaid payments that went to around 1.6 million providers between 2018 and 2024, $563 million in payouts went to providers that are blacklisted from federal healthcare programs for criminal activity or misconduct.\n\nStuart Russell, professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and an AI pioneer, told Business Insider that he is \"not optimistic\" that the plan to use AI to determine benefits eligibility will work as advertised.\n\n\"An AI system of this kind, some version of an LLM, is incapable of producing veridical explanations of its decisions, making it impossible to challenge false decisions,\" Russell said.\n\nRussell also cited the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, which bars decisions with significant legal effects on individuals from being made entirely by automated systems.\n\nBaobao Zhang, the Maxwell Dean associate professor of the politics of AI at Syracuse University, told Business Insider that though she cannot assess exactly how good Checkr's verification system is right now, past government attempts to mix people's benefits with an automated system are cautionary tales.\n\n\"If the federal government or other state governments are trying to contract with a vendor to automate welfare fraud detection, they need to have a serious evaluation in the real world before they deploy it, because the stakes are high, as history has proven,\" said Zhang.\n\nIn Indiana, an attempt to streamline and automate its welfare eligibility system by outsourcing a contract to IBM ended in a legal battle in which the state sued the company for $1.3 billion for the scrapped project in 2010. Based on court records, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration said that processing errors from IBM led to faulty benefits denials that brought harm to the needy.\n\nIn Australia, an automated government plan called Robodebt, designed to detect fraud, told welfare recipients to repay benefits and sent letters claiming they owed thousands of dollars in debt, based on an incorrect algorithm. A royal commission, which is Australia's highest form of public inquiry, found that at least three people died by suicide after being falsely told to pay back debt they don't owe by Robodebt. The system was ruled illegal by a court in 2019.\n\nIfeoma Ajunwa, the founding director of the AI and the Future of Work Program at Emory University, told Business Insider that if any government agency is to adopt AI, there should be an advisory council made up of technologists and social scientists, and affected constituencies should be given a say.\n\n\"I think we need to move cautiously when delegating governmental functions to AI technologies,\" said Ajunwa. \"While these tools are touted to increase efficiency and lower costs, we also need to establish guardrails for their use to protect citizens.\"",

    "title": "NATO's falling behind in the race to build icebreakers, critical tools for a war in the Arctic",
    "description": "A top Norwegian military official identified icebreakers as one of the capability gaps that exist between NATO and Russia and China.",
    "fullText": "NATO forces are falling behind Russia and China in the race to build icebreakers, ships that would be crucial in an Arctic war, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nIn an interview, Vice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, identified icebreakers as one of the key capability gaps that exist between NATO and its rivals in the Arctic.\n\nRussia and China are the only two countries that are building icebreakers at scale. The West has been \"falling behind\" in its ability to operate fully in the Arctic compared to Moscow and Beijing, Andersen said last week.\n\nRussia has dozens of icebreakers — roughly 40 by some estimates, far more than any other country — while China, which has increased its Arctic activity in recent years, fields around five. Moscow and Beijing plan to work together to expand that fleet.\n\nThe US, by contrast, fields just one heavy polar icebreaker along with a number of smaller vessels. The Trump administration said last year that the US Coast Guard's fleet of Arctic-capable vessels is \"insufficient to meet current operations demands and presents a national security risk.\" The president also called for a dramatic boost to the overall size of the fleet.\n\nArctic security has become a growing focal point for NATO in recent years as Russian and Chinese activity expands. Increased competition has spotlighted the icebreaker gap.\n\nThese ships, which are purpose-built to crush ice blocking waterways, are critical in this region because they enable better movement across frozen yet strategic terrain, unlocking access to trade routes and natural resources. In a fight, they allow access to the battlespace, as well as enable logistics and support missions.\n\nCanada, Finland, and other NATO allies add dozens of icebreakers to the Western alliance's ice-breaking arsenal, bringing it closer to parity with Russia, but Arctic experts believe nearly a third of them are past their design life. Russia's fleet is heavier and more specialized, built for heavy-ice operations in ways that many alliance vessels aren't.\n\nA NATO official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military capabilities, told Business Insider that while Russia may have more of certain maritime platforms than the West, the country still faces readiness challenges that affect its ability to put ships to sea.\n\nThis creates \"strategic dilemmas with their force projection,\" the official said.\n\nAndersen said NATO countries have acknowledged the numerical deficit in icebreakers and are making strides to close the gap.\n\nThe Trump administration, for instance, said in October that it plans to order four Arctic Security Cutters, medium icebreaking ships, from Finland and build another seven in American shipyards using Finnish expertise.\n\nThe Coast Guard assesses that it needs at least nine of those ships \"to serve our national security needs year-round in the Arctic,\" the White House said at the time.\n\nFinland is the world leader in icebreaker production. Its companies have designed 80% of the world's icebreakers, and its local shipyards have built 60% of them. Other leading countries include Canada, Russia, and China.\n\nCmdr. Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command, told Business Insider that member states \"are making tangible investments in icebreakers.\"\n\n\"Our collective capabilities provide allied navies and coast guards the ability to operate in Arctic conditions,\" he added.\n\nBeyond the icebreakers, NATO allies are investing in other technologies and systems to improve their Arctic foothold, including additional surveillance capabilities, drones, satellites, and vehicles that can withstand cold temperatures.\n\nWestern forces have also increased the scale of their Arctic exercises to familiarize soldiers with the harsh terrain and launched new deterrence operations to strengthen their posture across the region.",

    "title": "Meet Tekmerion: The classics-obsessed macro investor spinning out of Brevan Howard with $1 billion",
    "description": "\"There's an opportunity right now where macro is hot and en vogue, and we want to be out there fundraising,\" said Zachary Squire, the firm's CIO.",
    "fullText": "In a way, Tekmerion Capital is a throwback to an earlier era of hedge funds.\n\nBefore mega funds like Millennium and Citadel shifted the $5.2 trillion industry toward more institutional \"skill factories,\" hedge funds were dominated by quirky characters trading niche markets and esoteric instruments.\n\nZachary Squire certainly fits that bill. The chief investment officer of Tekmerion Capital, which will spin out of Brevan Howard next month with $1 billion in assets, Squire has the investing bona fides — with stops at D.E. Shaw, Bridgewater, and HBK — that would catch any allocator's eye.\n\nEven in the eccentric world of macro investors, though, Squire stands out. A Princeton valedictorian who majored in Latin and ancient Greek, he's turning his undergraduate thesis — a deep dive into property rights in the works of Roman philosopher Cicero — into a book. He sang opera as a child growing up in New York City.\n\nSquire and his partner, Reed Morrissey, the firm's CEO, are now pitching to new backers. The pair is in South Beach this week for the annual iConnections conference to meet with potential investors — and to add to his many conversation starters, Squire drove from New York to Miami.\n\nTekmerion counts multimanager quant fund, Engineers Gate, and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz as investors and is positioning itself as a diversifier for institutions heavily exposed to US stocks, driven by differentiated macro research.\n\n\"There's an opportunity right now where macro is hot and en vogue, and we want to be out there fundraising,\" said Squire in an interview last week at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Balcony Lounge restaurant.\n\n\"We want investors who understand what macro is, we want investors who understand hedge funds,\" he added.\n\nSquire initially had no interest in money management. He was set to pursue a Master's in philosophy at Cambridge University when a cold email from legendary fund D.E. Shaw changed his trajectory.\n\n\"I still don't know how they found me,\" he said. He joined the firm's entry-level rotational associates program, in part because Cambridge allowed him to defer his enrollment for a year.\n\nD.E. Shaw is known for its focus on talent that, at first glance, doesn't fit the typical Wall Street mold. Squire said the pitch was basically \"everything in the finance industry is learning.\" Winning, for asset managers, requires \"sheer intellectual horsepower.\"\n\nHe spent the bulk of his two years there on risk management, where he was exposed to the entire catalogue of markets, asset classes, and instruments the firm trades. He then joined Bridgewater, the Ray Dalio-founded firm that holds the title of largest hedge fund in the world, researching and trading global rates and currencies. An internal trading game — where employees could invest part of their pay in ideas they believed in — ultimately helped Tekmerion come about.\n\nHis strong performance in the game \"gave me confidence I could do something like this,\" Squire said.\n\nAdding to his macro toolkit, Squire spent the next three years in London for credit investor HBK, focused on emerging markets.\n\nThe Tekmerion framework began to emerge, in large part thanks to Morrissey, a childhood friend who majored in international relations at Georgetown and worked in Malawi during his Fulbright scholarship.\n\nMorrissey \"saw the vision before I did,\" Squire said, and soon the pair, along with a fellow Bridgewater alum, Lawrence Minicone, set out to raise money for the new venture. A mutual connection living in Puerto Rico brought them into Novogratz's orbit, who backed them.\n\nTekmerion — a Greek word that, in academic texts, means irrefutable proof but in everyday language translates to \"boundary stone\" or a marker to delineate two sides — was launched in early 2017 with a small team and a relative pittance of capital.\n\nThe firm's launch quickly caught the attention of the executive team at Bridgewater, including Dalio. Bridgewater's legal team kept its complaints in private arbitration, where the mega fund alleged Tekmerion had run amok of past employee agreements thanks to a \"misappropriation of trade secrets, breaches of contract, and unfair competition.\"\n\nTekmerion eventually won a positive ruling from the panel, which found that Bridgewater had \"manufactured false evidence.\" The case spilled into public view in 2020 because Tekmerion sued Bridgewater to recover millions in legal fees, though that case was settled in August 2020.\n\nBridgewater declined to comment. Despite the frustration with Bridgewater and its legal strategy, Squire appreciates his former employer's focus on publishing research, something Tekmerion has continued.\n\nIn that stressful time for the young fund, Minicone stepped away from the fund to work at RB Venture Partners as a private market investor.\n\nIn the years following the pandemic, the fund began to gain traction, delivering returns of nearly 30% in 2022, when global equity markets tanked, and 9.3% in 2023, outperforming larger macro players like Rokos Capital and Bridgewater. The manager caught the eye of billionaire Brevan Howard cofounder Alan Howard, who personally backed the young fund.\n\nThat relationship kicked off a relationship between not just Tekmerion and Howard, but also his firm. In 2024, the manager merged into the Brevan platform, where they continued to manage their own branded fund under Brevan's umbrella of strategies.\n\nSquire and Morrissey are excited to be back on their own again, though with a bigger team and much more capital. An undisclosed number of Brevan employees who worked under them are a part of the relaunch team. While Howard and Brevan are not investors in the relaunch, the firm retains the right to invest later and gets a share of Tekmerion's revenue going forward.\n\nThe firm's main partnership is now Engineers Gate, the multimanager systematic firm run by Greg Eisner. The fund will work from Engineers Gate's midtown Manhattan offices in a building that also houses multistrategy giant Balyasny. (They eventually hope to find their own space downtown, closer to the Chinatown neighborhood Squire and Morrissey call home).\n\nWith many operational headaches settled thanks to the Engineers Gate relationship, the focus can now be on research and the firm's models more than ever. Despite being a systematic macro manager, Squire said, \"We don't like to be called a quant.\"\n\nTekmerion's process starts with discretionary macro research to determine which investment signals and data inputs are worth weighing more heavily than others in an algorithm. Because of the slow frequency of many macro datasets, the firm typically holds positions for weeks at a time, Morrissey said.\n\nSquire and Morrissey believe the firm's nowcasting — their projection of what the macro environment is in the moment, since many economic data points are produced on a delay, such as the unemployment rate — is a key part of the pitch for potential LPs, which would get access to both the research and the fund's returns.\n\nIn the meantime, the pair keep their history and shared background top of mind. When Miles Johnson, a student from their old high school, reached out in 2022 with a passion for the classics but uncertainty about his career path, the firm brought him on as an intern. They said he's been a \"rockstar\" for the manager as he's matriculated at Columbia and continues doing research for the manager.\n\n\"Talent doesn't have a blueprint,\" Morrissey said.\n\n\"You don't need the same degree or background; people are people, and it's their grit and drive that we're interested in.\"",

    "description": "A deadly disease is ravaging Rajasthan's sandstone workers, widowing families and trapping them in debt as they toil in the same lethal jobs.",
    "fullText": "Bimla is in her late 20s and already a widow. She breaks sandstone in a quarry in the Indian state of Rajasthan, shaping tiles from the same rocks that once coated her husband's lungs. He died from silicosis in 2021.\n\nSilicosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling fine silica dust generated when rock, like sandstone, is broken. It scars the lungs over time, making breathing difficult. There is no cure, and many sandstone miners in Rajasthan with silicosis don't live past 40, according to a 2020 report. Independent estimates suggest over half of mine workers are afflicted with the disease, and as many as 800,000 people in Rajasthan may have it.\n\nIn Bimla's village of about 30 homes, 20 women were widows when Business Insider visited in September (see the video footage below). When asked if their husbands died for the same reason as hers, Bimla said, \"All of them.\"\n\nLike Bimla, many of the widows in her village, near Bhil-Basti, work breaking stones, the same type of labor their former husbands did. The pay is minimal — $2 to $3 a day and about half of what men earn — but they have little choice in the matter.\n\nMany of the women have taken on debt from quarry operators and moneylenders to pay for medical bills, funerals, and to support their children.\n\n\"They can't complain, because they've taken out loans,\" said activist Rana Sengupta, who heads a local NGO called the Mine Labour Protection Campaign and calls the situation a contemporary form of slavery. \"No one is tied in chains, but they cannot escape, either.\"\n\nThe state of Rajasthan sits on more than 960 million tons of mineable sandstone valued at over $160 billion. In 2024 and 2025, about $59 million worth of sandstone was exported from India.\n\nThe stone has built palaces and the president's house in India and is shipped abroad for bathrooms, driveways, and cobbled roads.\n\nIn a state exporting tens of millions of dollars' worth of stone, Bimla counts her household budget in rupees. She said she earns up to 7,000 rupees a month — about $80 — to support herself and her four children.\n\nThe government provides 25 kilograms of grain per month, but it is not enough to feed her entire family, she said at the time of filming. \"I stay hungry myself, but I feed them: This is not a good life.\"\n\nShe's taken out loans because her income isn't enough to support the household. That's on top of the debt her husband had, which is now her responsibility. \"Yes, it is still there; it wasn't paid back,\" she said.\n\nEvery month, 3,000 rupees ($33) of her earnings go toward repayments. At the time of filming, her loans amounted to more than 100,000 rupees ($1,100), she said.\n\nSapna's story follows a similar arc. Sapna, who lives in the same village as Bimla, has been working in the quarry for years. (Many women in the village don't have last names.)\n\nBoth Sapna's husband and daughter died from silicosis. Her daughter was only 20 when she passed, she said. \"Breaking stone has ruined my life,\" Sapna said. She now has silicosis, too.\n\nShe still works when she can, earning about 300 rupees ($3) a day. She's in debt to her boss at the quarry, who charges 70% interest and requires payment every 15 days, she said. Business Insider was unable to reach Sapna's boss for comment. Another mine owner we contacted did not respond to any phone calls.\n\nShe's taken multiple loans over the years to cover her husband's debt and support herself. She says she no longer knows how much she owes, and doesn't think she'll ever be able to pay it all. \"I can't work much, so this debt is not going anywhere.\"\n\nMine owners lease the land from the government and hire contractors to recruit workers and negotiate loans. The system does not prioritize workers, Sengupta said.\n\n\"The owners who give out these loans have a long-term plan: 'I am now free to exploit these workers anytime,'\" Sengupta told Business Insider.\n\nRadha Bai, a widow living in the same village as Bimla and Sapna, began working at the quarry in 1983. A few years later, silicosis killed her husband.\n\nFour decades on, she is in her 60s and still breaking stones. At the time of filming, she made about 30 tiles a day, earning 30 cents. She still mourns the passing of her husband. \"It hurts to be called a widow,\" she said, adding that, \"My husband was amazing.\"\n\nRadha Bai never learned to read or write, leaving her with few other options than to continue working at the quarry. \"I know how to write half of my name,\" she said, adding, \"So what work can I do now? You can only achieve your dreams if you're educated,\" she said.\n\nSending their children to school costs money. Bimla said she's working to afford her children's education. Another worker, Navraji Ram, told Business Insider he'd taken out loans to send his children to school.\n\n\"I will put all my efforts toward their education, but I won't let them work in the mining industry,\" Navraji Ram said.\n\nBusiness Insider senior producer Olivia Nemec emailed and called every number listed on the Ministry of Mines, Department of Labor, and Rajasthan's local state labor and mining departments for comment on debt bondage, what's being done to hold mine owners accountable, and why so few people are receiving state aid for silicosis. Half of the numbers weren't in service, including the one for the state's silicosis help desk. Other numbers, no one responded. Two calls to phone numbers listed for the Rajasthan State Labor Department were answered, but in both instances, the officials hung up after Nemec began asking questions. Nemec received no responses via email, either.",

    "fullText": "Glowfrog Games; PC \nShort but very sweet tale asks the player to compile a scrapbook of mementoes telling the story of a heartfelt bond that frays over time\n\nThere are few things sadder than the end of a close friendship. Whether it happens in a sudden moment of betrayal or after years of gradual separation, the feelings of loss can stay with you for a lifetime.\n\nThis is the theme of Pieced Together, a quiet, charming narrative game about best pals Connie and Beth, who meet at school in the 1990s and form an immediate, seemingly inseparable bond. Through the ingenious medium of an interactive scrapbook, we play as Connie, glueing in photos, notes and memories of her friend after years of separation. The game begins with several attempts to write Beth a letter, before we cut-out, stick and sort the story of their lives together.\n\nThe scrapbook process is divided into chapters of Connie’s life. She moves to a new area with her mum, and this is marked through photos of a moving van, a good luck card, a label with “Connie’s stuff” written on it that was stuck on a box full of her things. You place these items on the pages, thereby telling the story. Connie has a birthday soon after moving and none of her new classmates accept an invitation to her party except Beth. There are photos of that day, and, later, trips to London, sleepovers, drawings and notes. Eventually, they get through exams and holidays until life becomes more complicated.\n\nSometimes you have to figure out which memories go where – and the process reveals poignant moments of sisterhood. Connie helps Beth with her schoolwork, Beth helps Connie navigate her emotions and have fun. There are fun little interludes, such as creating a little history of cats, and lots of puzzles where you might have to figure out Connie’s exam timetable or help guide her through the Paris catacombs. But all the while you’re piecing together an illustrated history of a friendship. In time, there are big decisions to be made and you get a bit of a say about how things are handled between the girls. But what the game wants you to know – and what I think we all realise – is that some things in life are inevitable.\n\nWhat I love about the scrapbook format is the way in which it gently turns the player into a visual collaborator. You put the photos and notes where you want them, turning them to fit, overlapping them if you like. It’s also possible to unlock sticker collections so you can add your own stylistic flourishes to the pages. Sadly, although you can replay chapters after you finish, there doesn’t seem to be a way to revisit your scrapbook, which is a shame as I stuck a lot of stickers in mine – a process that gave me more ownership over the story. I guess I’ll have to play again.\n\nMade by a team of just four, headed by Bafta-winning artist and designer Kate Killick, Pieced Together is a short game – you can finish it in a couple of hours. But in that time, it packs in an enormous amount of detail about childhood and teen life in the 1990s: filling out magazine quizzes, writing anonymous love notes, the freedom of first holidays with friends. It also cleverly shows how, even as we focus more on our peers, our parents remain a gigantic emotional influence. A subplot has Connie awkwardly bonding with her absent father and his new partner, leaning on Beth for support. It is a complex moment told merely through notes and images, and all the more powerful for it.\n\nFrom Life Is Strange to Undertale to Knights and Bikes, independent games have proved a rich and evocative medium through which to explore the theme of friendship. Pieced Together is another example, a careful, beautiful little game that, in more ways than one, turns nostalgia into art. After finishing it, I was inspired to contact an old pal I haven’t spoken to in ages and wasn’t sure I ever would again. Good games can be like good friendships: they encourage us to see things anew.",

The crisis peaked last year when her vehicle was repossessed without her knowledge, even though her paycheck was still being deposited into their joint account.\n\nSince the minivan was in Alyssa's name, the repossession left her with damaged credit. Afterward, her husband asked his mother to co-sign on another loan. Alyssa said her mother-in-law now contacts her if the payment is even a day late.\n\nAlthough she considers herself detail-oriented, Alyssa said her husband had always handled the bills. After the repossession, she briefly wrote down their income and expenses and tried to stay involved. However, during a busy season with her children's activities, she stepped back and assumed payments were being made.\n\n\"What I don’t understand is why you’re still sitting on the sidelines and haven’t gotten involved,\" Ramsey said, urging her to sit down with her husband and review every dollar.\n\nTrending: Designed for investors with strong market convictions, REX Shares builds ETFs for income, leverage, and tactical positioning — explore the lineup.\n\nAlyssa said she does not know the exact total of their debt. She estimated their mortgage at about $1,500 and their car payment at roughly $750. Ramsey told her she needs precise figures, not estimates.\n\n\"You may have to be the one that actually is paying the car payment and is paying the bills for a season,\" Cruze said.\n\nRamsey calculated their combined income and walked through the basics: food, utilities, housing and transportation. He said those essentials should be paid first before any extras.\n\nWhen Alyssa blamed her husband for the situation, Ramsey pushed back.",

I can't wait to get up there.\n\n\"It has been fantastic and one of the best feelings I have ever had being in that back room knowing what I am here for.\"\n\nRock has lost all his Premier League quarter-finals so far 6-2 after being defeated by Jonny Clayton in Newcastle, beaten by Michael van Gerwen in Antwerp and Luke Humphries knocking him out in Glasgow.\n\nAs a result, he is currently bottom of the Premier League table on zero points, alongside Stephen Bunting but that doesn't concern him.\n\n\"I am playing OK, I haven't started off the Premier League as I wanted to, but I have to build the bridge and go over it,\" he continued.\n\n\"I think I have coped with it well, but obviously everyone I am playing has been playing better than me, so I just need to up the gear.\n\n\"The best eight players in the world are there for a reason and it is going to be tough to beat them so hopefully that Northern Irish crowd is going to get on my side and I can beat Van Veen.\"\n\nLittler headlines Premier League line-up\n\nClayton wins Premier League night three in Glasgow\n\nRock blames bathroom soap for poor Antwerp display\n\nHis opening opponent on Thursday night is also a Premier League newcomer.\n\nVan Veen, 23, has had a breakthrough year, reaching the World Championship final in January after winning the European Championship in 2025, and is also a back-to-back World Youth Champion.\n\nHowever, Rock added that he has \"not one bit\" of sympathy for Van Veen if he experiences a hostile response in Belfast.\n\n\"It happened to me when we played in Holland last year,\" Rock said.\n\n\"I would be surprised if he didn't get booed, but I think he will get booed the whole game. Van Veen has coped with the crowds and I think he will be OK.\n\n\"It will be very, very loud. We haven't had a Northern Irish player since 2019 [Daryl Gurney] so hopefully it'll all come good.\"\n\nIt has been an exciting start to the Premier League with three different winners so far.\n\nMichael van Gerwen, Gerwyn Price and Jonny Clayton have won the opening nights of the 16-week league phase before the play-offs at the O2 Arena on 28 May.\n\n\"It is good to see different winners, but the Premier League is a lot different to majors,\" he added.\n\n\"The first major of the year Luke Littler won it, shock. Who was in the final? Luke Humphries.\n\n\"When it comes to the ranking majors, it is hard to look past the two Lukes then everyone else when in the Premier League.\"\n\nYou can follow live text commentary from night four of the Premier League on Thursday on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. — A Springfield-area doctor is being sued by his ex-wife and her boyfriend, who say he repeatedly looked up their medical records through CoxHealth systems without a valid reason and later used private information to allegedly embarrass them and cause financial harm.\n\nJessica Scott and Jeffrey Harper filed the lawsuit Tuesday, Feb. 24, in Greene County Circuit Court.\n\nThe suit names Grant R. Scott, a vascular surgeon, as the defendant. The petition alleges he was fired from Cox in June 2025.\n\nThe petition says Jessica Scott and Grant Scott were married in 2006. The petition also says Jessica Scott and Harper have been dating since about 2020.\n\nAccording to the petition, the doctor accessed Jessica Scott’s CoxHealth records at least 19 times between August 2020 and May 2025. It also alleges he accessed Harper’s CoxHealth record in August 2024.\n\nThe lawsuit points to letters the plaintiffs say they received from CoxHealth in 2025.\n\nOne letter, dated July 18, 2025, told Jessica Scott that “an employee accessed your medical records multiple times from June 2023 to June 2025 without direct job-related duty,” the petition says.\n\nA second letter, dated July 30, 2025, told Harper that a “breach occurred” when an employee accessed his medical record “without a direct job-related duty,” the petition says.\n\n“We can confirm that the physician is not employed with CoxHealth, and we were unaware of this private, civil dispute,” a spokesman for Cox told Ozarks First.\n\nThe lawsuit also links the alleged record access to problems that surfaced around the same time. It says that in June 2025, someone began using Jessica Scott’s personal information for credit-related inquiries and posted Craigslist ads using her information.\n\nThe petition says she filed a police report.\n\nAdditionally, the petition says the plaintiffs also filed complaints with agencies including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights and Missouri’s Board of Registration for the Healing Arts.\n\nA court date has not been set yet.",

    "fullText": "Former Chelsea captain John Terry says he is \"frustrated\" at being overlooked for a caretaker role following Enzo Maresca's departure as head coach in January.\n\nTerry, who works two days a month as a part‑time mentor in Chelsea's academy, was not included among the staff appointed to take temporary charge for the matches against Manchester City and Fulham after Maresca's surprise exit.\n\nFull‑time Under‑21s coach Calum McFarlane was chosen as caretaker boss after Maresca left the club following a dramatic falling out behind the scenes.\n\nCurrent head coach Liam Rosenior later took the role permanently after joining from sister club Strasbourg.\n\nAsked by the Golf Life YouTube channel, external if he was annoyed by the decision, Terry replied: \"Not annoyed, probably more frustrated, because I was certainly part of that Under‑21s group that went over.\n\n\"So even if I didn't take the team… Calum took the team, did really well, got a result out of the game. I feel like I should have been part of that.\n\n\"Now listen, people have got to make decisions. I love it when people make decisions and they go 'yes' or 'no'. Clearly the ownership, or whoever made those decisions - the sporting directors - have gone 'no' not to include me, for whatever reason. I don't know why.\"\n\nPrivately, BBC Sport understands part of Terry's frustration comes from having completed all his coaching qualifications up to the Uefa Pro Licence, while also holding a Fifa diploma in leadership.\n\nHe also previously served as assistant head coach to Dean Smith - now managing FC Charlotte in the United States - during spells at Aston Villa and Leicester City.\n\nTerry now manages an indoor six-a-side influencer team in Baller League, called the 26ers.\n\nMcFarlane, by contrast, currently holds only a Uefa B Licence. However, officials still felt he was the more appropriate interim option, given his regular involvement with Maresca in his Under‑21s role. His side also played a similar system to Maresca's, and it was felt he would step in more seamlessly.\n\nHe has since impressed Rosenior and earned a promotion to his first‑team staff.\n\nTerry has more broadly expressed frustration at a lack of opportunities in coaching, including in an interview with BBC Sport last year, having applied for several roles in the English Football League.\n\n\"It's really disheartening, actually. I have interviewed for a few jobs myself and not got them due to my lack of experience as a number one, but having captained Chelsea and my country, I'm not sure you can do much \n\n\"I am ready and willing. I don't feel I need to sell John Terry as a manager or a coach or whatever that may be. If someone needs to win football matches, I'm not sure you're going to get anyone better. If you want to carry on losing football matches, then continue what you are doing.\"\n\nThe scope of Terry's current role at Chelsea is limited to the academy teams, and he has minimal interaction with first‑team players, aside from those who have graduated from the academy, such as current captain Reece James.\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and her peers.\n\n“Let’s also ensure that members of Congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information,” Trump told the crowd of lawmakers, which later erupted into applause.\n\nThe bipartisan praise appeared to surprise Trump, who scanned the Democratic side of the House chamber.\n\n“Did Nancy Pelosi stand up?” he quipped. “Doubt it.”\n\nTrump appeared to refer to Pelosi’s family’s extensive stock portfolio amassed during her decades in Congress, which has spurred allegations of insider trading. Pelosi has denied the allegations and endorsed a ban on congressional stock trading in 2022.\n\nTrump urged Congress to pass the Stop Insider Trading Act, which was introduced in the House last month, “without delay.” The bill has stalled in the House after dozens of Republicans refused to support it, according to Politico, while Democrats have called for a broader bill that also applies to the executive branch.\n\nTrump: Let's also ensure that members of congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information… They stood up for that. I can’t believe it. Did Nancy Pelosi stand up if she’s here? I doubt it. pic.twitter.com/HsYfMwcO5H\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 25, 2026\n\nWarren has been a longtime advocate for banning congressional stock trading, saying in a video last year that such a ban was “long overdue.”\n\n“No one in this country should wonder whether or not their senator, their representative, and president is making a decision that is good for the country. Or maybe just good for their own private pocketbook,” Warren said in the clip posted to her X account.\n\nStill, some Democrats heckled Trump as he called for the ban. “How about you first!” Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) yelled during the speech.\n\n“You’re the most corrupt president!” Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-IL) also shot back at Trump.\n\nThe post Elizabeth Warren, Other Democrats Applaud as Trump Condemns Congressional Stock Trading | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts will be without key defender Stuart Findlay for six weeks while record signing Eduardo Ageu will miss the rest of the season.\n\nHead coach Derek McInnes also confirmed goalkeeper Craig Gordon's shoulder injury could keep him out of Scotland's March friendlies against Japan and Ivory Coast.\n\nFindlay, 30, has been a pivotal figure for the league leaders having started all 28 Premiership matches in the middle of defence, but was forced off in the win over Falkirk with a hamstring injury.\n\nBrazilian midfielder Ageu made the first start of an injury-hit debut season against Rangers at Ibrox, but was taken off and will now be sidelined until next season because he needs thigh surgery.\n\nGordon has also played limited minutes for Hearts this term, but is one of Scotland's key players as they prepare for a first World Cup finals since 1998.\n\nBeni Baningime, Oisin McEntee and Sabah Kerjota also have knocks but still have a chance of playing against Aberdeen on Saturday as Hearts chase a first league title since 1960.\n\nVisit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Hearts news notifications in the BBC Sport app\n\nMcInnes says he hopes Findlay and captain Lawrence Shankland, who has been missing since 17 January with a hamstring injury, will be back for the final pre-split game against Motherwell on 11 April.\n\nAnother key figure, midfielder Cammy Devlin, is due back in \"two or three weeks\" according to McInnes, as is defender Stephen Kingsley.\n\nHearts are four points clear of Rangers at the top of the Premiership.\n\n\"As it stands we had 11 players unavailable to train today, but we've still got enough to train and put a strong team out and a strong squad out on Saturday,\" McInnes said.\n\n\"So my focus is the ones that are available, and just trying to get one or two who are in the 50-50 category available for the weekend.\n\n\"It's easy to feel sorry for yourself, easy to think: 'why us? why me?' But it's unrealistic to go through a full campaign [without injuries].\n\n\"It's a league for as reason, you have to go through these different tests and challenges.\n\n\"There's no doubt we're getting challenged at the minute. Once we get through the next four games we will ideally be a bit stronger going into the final run in.\n\n\"It will almost feel like a transfer window opening up in April. So you've got to take the good with the bad.\"\n\nMidfielder McEntee went to see a specialist on Wednesday morning for a shoulder issue after a scan revealed \"fairly positive\" news.\n\nBaningime has some bruising on his lower leg and McInnes says the midfielder is hopeful he can train on Friday and feature at Tynecastle against Aberdeen.\n\nKerjota, meanwhile, picked up a hip strain in a closed door friendly against Dundee on Tuesday but may well be fit to play too.",

    "description": "Gianni Infantino has clashed with unions and European football, but after 10 years as Fifa president he remains in an impregnable position.",
    "fullText": "It is 10 years since Gianni Infantino was elected Fifa president, with a remit to rescue football's world governing body.\n\nThe decade since has been one of reform, expansion and, more recently, controversy.\n\nInfantino was installed with Fifa engulfed by claims of widespread corruption and after predecessor Sepp Blatter had resigned.\n\nFifa's finances were in a desperate state. There was a reported $550m (£392m) black hole, external after sponsors walked away.\n\nIn Infantino, the game felt it had found a safe pair of hands.\n\n\"I will work tirelessly to bring football back to Fifa, and Fifa back to football,\" Infantino said.\n\nTen years on, there can be no doubt the governing body is in rude health. It expects to report record revenues, external of $13bn (£9.6bn) for the three-year cycle through to the end of this year.\n\nBut those figures only tell part of the story.\n\nThey are boosted by the controversial Club World Cup, and the biggest-ever World Cup with its high ticket prices.\n\nInfantino has clashed with players' unions and European football, but he remains in an impregnable position at the top of the world game.\n\nThis is the story of his presidency and his legacy.\n\nIt is easy to forget Blatter's successor as Fifa president was supposed to be Michel Platini.\n\nBut after Platini was drawn into the scandal at the organisation - both he and Blatter were later fully cleared of corruption charges - Infantino was thrust forward as Uefa's preferred candidate.\n\nAs the general secretary of European football's governing body, Infantino had been the right-hand man of president Platini for seven years.\n\nBut he was an unlikely saviour - a man who was rarely in the consciousness of the average football fan.\n\nTo many he was just the guy who presented Champions League draws.\n\nTen years on, you would be hard pressed to find a football fan who does not recognise him.\n\nTurning Fifa around was no small task.\n\nThe US Department of Justice had indicted a large number of top executives and it needed root-and-branch reform.\n\nTwo pages of Infantino's manifesto were devoted to more than doubling development money for member associations.\n\nThat would be for new competitions, for infrastructure, and even to cover travel costs for smaller nations.\n\nExpanding the World Cup was also included, though to 40 teams. Within a year it had been rubberstamped as a 48-team tournament.\n\nThe election was a close-run thing.\n\nIn the first round of votes, Infantino led Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa - president of the Asian confederation - by 88 votes to 85.\n\nInfantino only moved clear when the 34 votes originally cast for Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein and French executive Jerome Champagne were reallocated.\n\nThe final score was 115 votes to 88.\n\n\"This is a new day, a new dawn,\" said then Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, welcoming Infantino's win. \"He is not a politician and he is not an ego.\"\n\nInfantino, meanwhile, declared he would \"restore the image of Fifa\".\n\n\"It's your money, not the money of the Fifa president,\" Infantino told delegates. \"The money of Fifa has to be used to develop football.\"\n\nInfantino was true to his word. But to make more money, Fifa had to be creative.\n\nThe controversial World Cups of 2018 in Russia and 2022 in Qatar were waiting in Infantino's in-tray.\n\nIn his early years as president, Infantino kept a fairly low profile. It was only when the World Cup rolled into Qatar that he started to become a more public figure.\n\nUnder pressure amid repeated criticisms about workers' rights and claims of modern slavery in the country, Infantino hit back.\n\nHe first called out \"hypocrisy\" and \"racism\" about Qatar in the European media, then made his infamous speech about discrimination.\n\n\"Today I feel Qatari,\" he said. \"Today I feel Arabic. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel like a migrant worker.\"\n\nAt every game he attended, TV cameras appeared to pick him out in the crowd.\n\nAnd there was a reason. Reports, which Fifa declined to comment on, suggested television directors were advised that Infantino should be shown at least once each game, but not if he was on his phone., external\n\nFifa accused of breaching own rules with Trump award\n\nTrump and Infantino - too close for comfort?\n\nFifa accused of creating 'fake' player unions\n\nAfter the Qatar World Cup, Infantino made many more headlines - from hosting plans and new tournaments to disparaging remarks about the behaviour of England fans.\n\nInfantino had promised an expanded, summer Club World Cup shortly after his election in 2016.\n\nThe plan hit several delays but - two days before the 2022 World Cup final - Fifa eventually announced it would go ahead in 2025, hosted by the United States.\n\nIt placed a large-scale tournament in a summer which was usually reserved for player recovery.\n\nFifa rejected claims players' union' Fifpro and the World Leagues' Association were not consulted.\n\nThen came the unique allocation of the 2030 and 2034 World Cup finals.\n\nIt was decided the 2030 edition would be staged across three continents - Africa, Europe and South America. That meant the 2034 event had to go to Asia or Oceania.\n\nWith no realistic competition, it effectively guaranteed Saudi Arabia - another country with questions about its human rights record - would host.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Fifa, under Infantino, had developed a close relationship.\n\nNorway's football federation abstained from the process and argued the bidding process undermined \"Fifa's reforms for good governance\" and challenged \"trust in Fifa\".\n\nIn May 2024, it was revealed Infantino received a 33% pay rise, external upon his re-election the previous year.\n\nIt took his base salary from 1.95m Swiss francs (£1.7m) in 2022 to 2.6m Swiss francs (£2.3m).\n\nOn top of that, he was due a bonus of 1,650,000 Swiss francs (£1.5m), which was unchanged.\n\nInfantino, who was earning about £1.3m when first elected in 2016, is now close to Blatter's final annual salary payment of £2.6m., external\n\nHowever, a Fifa investigation showed that under Blatter leading executives were being paid huge bonuses running well into the millions., external\n\nIn November 2024, with the new-look Club World Cup drawing closer, Fifa unveiled the trophy - engraved with a personal tribute.\n\n\"Inspired by the Fifa president Gianni Infantino,\" it read.\n\nUefa was growing frustrated with Infantino's profile and his close relationship with US President Donald Trump.\n\nIt came to a head in May 2025. Infantino had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East with Trump and turned up two hours late for the Fifa Congress.\n\nUefa accused Infantino of prioritising \"private political interests\" and staged a walk-out.\n\nThen came last summer's Club World Cup, which was characterised by stadiums with swathes of empty seats.\n\nYet when Infantino gathered the media at Trump Tower, he declared it to be \"already the most successful club competition in the world\".\n\nIn December, the draw for this summer's World Cup was a long, lavish and outlandish affair.\n\nInfantino was front and centre, and Trump was awarded the controversial Fifa Peace Prize.\n\nWithin a week came the announcement of high ticket prices for the finals.\n\nGroup-stage tickets are up to three times the price of those for the 2022 World Cup, and the cheapest ticket for the final in New Jersey is £3,119.\n\nAfter a minor climbdown, Infantino defended the prices and said they reflected the public's \"absolutely crazy\" demand.\n\nInfantino insisted all the money would go back into the game, saying \"without Fifa there would be no football in 150 countries\".\n\nHe still had one more media mis-step to go before reaching his 10-year anniversary.\n\nEarlier this month he had to apologise after saying it was \"really special\" no British nationals were arrested during the 2022 World Cup.\n\nDespite the controversies, one fact remains: there is no meaningful opposition to Infantino.\n\nWhile the 55-year-old may face criticism in Europe, for the rest of the world he has made a clear difference. Yes, it is about money. But money for football.\n\nHe has enriched some of the poorest and smallest footballing nations, proving funding through infrastructure and development.\n\nInfantino has been true to his word that Fifa would be transparent - publishing the salaries of all top executives and keeping funds within football.\n\nThe Swiss delivered on his initial promise of an extra $5m (£3.7m) for every national association over the first four years, and $40m (£29.7m) for each confederation.\n\nAcross the first two cycles of the Fifa Forward project through to 2022, $2.8bn (£2.08bn) was made available for investment across the 211 member associations on more than 1,600 projects.\n\nFifa Forward 3.0, external - covering the years 2023 through to 2026 - has produced a 30% increase in funding.\n\nInfantino has provided a further $5m (£3.7m) for every member association, with another $60m (£44.48m) paid to each confederation for their own projects.\n\nAfter being re-elected unopposed in 2019 and 2023, he is approaching another election year in 2027.\n\nInfantino will be able to stand again, even though Fifa statues limit the president to a maximum of three terms.\n\nIn 2022 the governance, audit and compliance committee ruled his first term did not count, as it was only for three years.\n\nWith the way Infantino has improved the financial situation of so many associations, it is hard to see how anyone could realistically challenge him in 2027.\n\nAlmost half of the 211 votes are held by Asia and Africa - two regions that have benefited from the hugely increased finances.\n\nInfantino may be criticised for the way he has expanded the Club World Cup, and the World Cup, and the increased ticket prices.\n\nBut he sees it as a vehicle to increase investment in the game around the world.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "The 'rare combination' behind Britain's youngest F1 driver",
    "description": "Arvid Lindblad tells BBC Sport about being shaped by his Indian and Swedish heritage and how he was fixated on reaching F1 from aged five.",
    "fullText": "Arvid Lindblad's eyes light up. The 18-year-old who is about to become Britain's youngest ever Formula 1 driver is sitting on a beach in Bahrain, a Gulf mist obscuring the still-rising sun, and he's pondering a question.\n\nHe's been polite but wary so far. A five-minute drive from the circuit where he and his Racing Bulls team are completing their preparations for his grand prix debut in Australia at the beginning of March. On the cusp of achieving his lifetime's dream, understandably he wants to make sure he does not say anything he might regret.\n\nBut when he's asked what has been the best thing that's happened to him since he became an F1 driver, the joy inside him bubbles to the surface, and he can't resist a little smile.\n\n\"Since becoming a Formula 1 driver… the best thing was just becoming a Formula 1 driver,\" he says.\n\nHe learned about Red Bull's decision to promote him to their second team at last year's Qatar Grand Prix, where he was competing in the penultimate round of the Formula 2 championship.\n\nThe news was broken by Red Bull's former motorsport adviser Helmut Marko, the veteran former F1 driver who had taken Lindblad into the company's driver programme at the age of 13 as a promising go-karter.\n\n\"This is something I've been doing with my dad,\" Lindblad says. \"I got the news in Qatar when I was with him, so obviously that was a very special moment to share together.\"\n\nDoes he still have to pinch himself to make sure it's real? Lindblad pauses. \"A little bit,\" he says.\n\nLindblad's graduation to F1 this year is breaking new ground for the sport.\n\nHe is one of five British F1 drivers on the grid this year - six if you count Alex Albon, who was born and raised in the UK, but races under the Thai flag. He's also the first Briton with Indian heritage to race at the highest level of the sport.\n\nHis father, Stefan, is Swedish. His mother, Anita, is of Indian descent. The partition of India in 1947 played a significant role in the family's history.\n\n\"My Nani, my grandmother, is Sikh, grandfather's Hindu,\" Lindblad says. \"And when they were five, they were involved in the partition.\n\n\"They were in the part of Punjab that is now Pakistan, and they had to leave. They came from quite well-off backgrounds, but then they lost everything. So then they had to work very hard their whole life to recreate a life for themselves. Then they moved to the UK in their late 20s, early 30s, as doctors.\"\n\nHis family background is, he acknowledges, \"quite a rare combination, but I'm very proud of my heritage. All three parts have really shaped me to who I am today\".\n\nHe adds: \"I've been very exposed to all three. Even though my grandparents moved to the UK when they had my mum, they're still very traditional Indians. I've been exposed to a lot of their cultures and rituals, the food, the prayer, all that sort of stuff, from an early age, as well as the Swedish. It's really shaped who I am today.\"\n\nLanguage skills have not passed down the generations as effectively as culture, though.\n\n\"I'm not the best at languages, to be honest. I can speak a little bit of Swedish and a few words of Hindi, but it's not great,\" Lindblad says.\n\n\"I couldn't do an interview in another language, so it's something I'm still working towards. I think it is important and it's also an element of respect, but I've got some work to do.\"\n\nThe interest in motorsport came from his father's side of the family.\n\n\"My grandfather is a massive motorsports fan,\" Lindblad says. \"He'll watch anything with wheels and an engine. He did a little bit of motocross with my dad when he was younger. Unfortunately, they couldn't do it for very long, but he passed that passion down to my dad, who passed it on to me.\n\n\"When I was three, my dad got me a motocross bike. To be honest, it didn't last very long. It was a bit too much for my mum to sit a little three-year-old on a motocross bike. So that died out quite quickly.\n\n\"But then when I was five I went karting for the first time and loved it from the beginning.\n\n\"But I'd say a big turning point for me that I remember very well was when I was about four. My dad was sitting on the sofa and had the F1 on and I came and sat down next to him and was watching the race and asking him, 'Is it possible to be there? Could I? How does it work?'\n\n\"That was really the moment when I saw the cars and wanted to be there one day and that fuelled the start of the journey.\"\n\nHe says he has been fixated on this moment from a very early age.\n\n\"From the beginning I wanted to be in F1 and I believed for some reason that I could,\" he says. \"I don't know if that was false hope or what, but from five I believed I could be in F1, and that was always what I was working towards.\"\n\nLindblad was born and grew up in well-to-do Virginia Water in Surrey, and is the first to acknowledge that he has been helped on his way by the relative comfort of his background.\n\n\"I'm very fortunate to be able to do racing, because as everyone knows it's not the most accessible sport to everyone,\" he says.\n\n\"I've already touched on a bit my mum's side, that they were very hard-working and they had to really fight for what they had.\n\n\"My grandmother retired as a doctor at 82, and my mum is very similar. Well, she's not 82, but she has that very similar work ethic. And my dad even more so.\n\n\"He came from a small village in Sweden, where sometimes my grandparents struggled to put three meals on the table.\n\n\"He had his first job from when he was 11, trying to just do anything he could to get any pocket money. He funded himself through university and he's worked really hard his whole life, and it's a big reason why I'm able to do this and be here today.\n\n\"So I'm extremely thankful and grateful for that. But even more so I think I'm very lucky to come from a family where hard work, humility and all of those values are very important. That's really something I try to show and act of as well.\"\n\nHis progression to F1 has been rapid. After seven years in karts, winning a number of international championships, he made his car-racing debut in 2022 aged only 15, and has been fast-tracked by Marko through F4, F3 and F2 year by year.\n\nWe're talking at the plush hotel Racing Bulls have picked as their base for the two pre-season tests in Bahrain, which followed a 'shakedown' in Spain. It's not long past 8am, and his next appointment is an engineering meeting, before going out on track later in the day.\n\nAsked if he feels ready for the big time in F1, he says: \"Yeah, I think so. Obviously, it's a big step from F2, especially this year. There's regulation changes and everything is very different.\n\n\"But I've been working really hard with the team on the sim (simulator) at the factory, obviously also trying to utilise these three tests that we have.\n\n\"That's a big benefit for me this year. Normally, there's only one, whereas this year there's three. So that really helps me to get up to speed. I'm really trying to utilise these tests, and I'm looking forward to getting on track in Melbourne.\"\n\nRacing Bulls team principal Alan Permane, who has worked with a multitude of top drivers, including Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso, has been full of praise so far.\n\n\"He's done a fantastic job,\" Permane says. \"People often ask me, 'What do you look for? What do you need in a young driver?' And of course, the first thing you need is for them to be quick. We're very comfortable with that, we know he's got the speed.\n\n\"But also on top of that, he's bringing lots of inquisitiveness, he's asking many questions, his debriefs are great, he's doing everything we ask of him at the moment.\"\n\nF1 is a brutal business, with little sentiment. Drivers either achieve or they're out. And nowhere is more ruthless than Red Bull.\n\nYou might expect Lindblad to be feeling a little pressure mixed in with the obvious excitement. But he says not.\n\n\"I wouldn't really say pressure,\" he says. \"If I'm being honest, this is what I've worked towards my whole life.\n\n\"So I'm excited to be here, and all I'm really thinking about at the moment is trying to work with the team, trying to understand the cars to get the best performance I can, trying to extract the most out of the package from the beginning.\"\n\nWhy has it gone so wrong for Aston Martin?\n\nWho are the winners and losers from F1 pre-season testing?\n\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

    "description": "Only four of the nine Supreme Court justices were in attendance for Trump's speech, where he scolded them for their \"very unfortunate ruling\" on tariffs",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address on Feb. 24, decrying the recent Supreme Court ruling against his tariff plan as \"very unfortunate\"\n\nThe diatribe came just days after Trump called the justices who voted down his tariff plan a \"disgrace to our nation\"\n\nOnly four of the nine Supreme Court justices were in attendance for the speech\n\nPresident Donald Trump blasted the Supreme Court to their face during his State of the Union address following their recent ruling against his tariff plan.\n\nDuring his speech at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, Feb. 24, the president made several pointed remarks at the members of the Supreme Court. Only four justices were present — Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett — but that didn't stop Trump from criticizing the court as a whole for their decision.\n\n\"It was an unfortunate ruling from the United States Supreme Court, a very unfortunate ruling,\" Trump said, while the four present justices sat in the front row.\n\nThe remarks come four days after the Supreme Court voted 6-3 to strike down one of Trump's most touted policies of his second term so far: import tariffs.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last week that the president exceeded his authority when he imposed unprecedented tariffs on imports from almost every U.S. trading partner by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.\n\nHowever, as he did at the time of the ruling, Trump promised he had plans to keep the tariffs in place, just not by using IEEPA.\n\n\"Almost all countries and corporations want to keep the deal that they already made, knowing that the legal power that I have as president could be far worse for them,\" he said. \"Congressional action will not be necessary... We finally have a president who puts America first.\"\n\nTrump's April 2, 2025, announcement of his tariffs, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" declared the imposition of a 10% baseline duty on most imports to the U.S., with some nations navigating higher tariffs if they didn't participate in trade negotiations, Time reported. Many countries retaliated by increasing taxes on U.S. goods, causing the stock market to dive.\n\nThe morning the SCOTUS ruling was announced, striking that plan down, Trump was hosting a breakfast with governors from around the country.\n\nAlthough he dismissed members of the White House press corps from the room shortly after entering, CNN's Kaitlan Collins reported that, inside the closed-door meeting, the president called the Supreme Court ruling a \"disgrace\" and assured the gathered governors that \"he has a backup plan.\"\n\nLater in the day, Trump ultimately did address the press, calling the ruling \"deeply disappointing.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely ashamed of certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,\" Trump, 79, said. \"When you read the dissenting opinions, there's no way that anyone can argue against them.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe president praised the three dissenting justices — Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — but called those who voted for the majority \"a disgrace to our nation.\"\n\nHe reserved his sharpest insults for Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch — the two Trump appointees who voted against his tariffs — calling them \"an embarrassment to their families.”\n\n\"It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests,\" he continued. \"It's almost like [the decision was] written by not very smart people.\"\n\nFive of the nine Supreme Court justices skipped Trump's 2026 State of the Union address: Republican-appointed justices Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch, as well as Democrat-appointed justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.",

    "description": "Modi’s visit is an act of cultivation. If Modi’s 2017 visit was a breakthrough in the relationship, his 2026 return signifies the consolidation of those ties.",
    "fullText": "Modi’s visit is an act of cultivation. If Modi’s 2017 visit was a breakthrough in the relationship, his 2026 return signifies the consolidation of those ties.\n\nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Wednesday for a two-day visit – his second trip to the country. But this one is about far more than ceremony, contracts, or even bilateral warmth. It comes at a moment of geopolitical inversion.\n\nOn the tarmac at Ben-Gurion Airport on a sweltering July day in 2017, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greeted Modi with the words, “Prime Minister, we’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”\n\nAnd, indeed, Israel had. It took nearly 70 years for an Indian prime minister to visit the Jewish state – a state India voted against at the United Nations in 1947 and with which it established diplomatic relations only in 1992.\n\nIsrael had to wait only nine years for a return visit.\n\nIn the intervening years, what was once a cautious, low-profile relationship has matured into one of Israel’s most consequential strategic partnerships. Modi now arrives not merely as a visitor but as the leader of the world’s most populous country and one of the fastest-rising global powers.\n\nModi’s visit comes amid intensifying efforts in parts of the international community to isolate Israel over the Israel-Hamas War. There are diplomatic pressures, legal challenges, calls for sanctions, and boycotts. Yet here is the prime minister of India – a nation of 1.4 billion people, a civilizational power, and a major global player – not distancing himself, not downgrading ties, but deepening them.\n\nFor Netanyahu, that image alone carries weight. It is a rebuttal to the isolation narrative.\n\nBut there is also a striking reversal of fortunes embedded in this visit.\n\nIn 2017, when Modi first came, Israel’s diplomatic position was on the rise. Netanyahu was aggressively expanding Israel’s global reach – into Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Gulf, and Eastern Europe – selling Israeli strengths in intelligence, cybersecurity, agriculture, and water technology. Israel’s international standing was improving.\n\nToday, India’s global trajectory is the one on the ascent. New Delhi is positioning itself as a bridge between East and West, a manufacturing powerhouse, a technological hub, and a counterweight to China. Israel, meanwhile, is navigating one of the most diplomatically challenging periods in its history.\n\nIn other words, Modi’s return visit comes amid a reversal of momentum.\n\nNetanyahu hopes to leverage Israel’s close relationship with India as part of a broader diplomatic architecture – what he described at Sunday’s cabinet meeting as a “hexagon” of alliances: India, select Arab states, Greece, Cyprus, African partners, and additional Asian players.\n\nThe intention, Netanyahu said, “is to create an axis of countries that see reality, the challenges, and the goals through the same lens, facing the radical axes – both the radical Shi’ite axis, which we have struck hard, and the emerging radical Sunni axis.”\n\nIndia is central to that vision.\n\nWhen Modi came to power in 2014, he instituted what became known as a policy of “de-hyphenation” – separating India’s relationship with Israel from its relationship with the Palestinians. No longer would ties with Jerusalem be automatically balanced or constrained by Ramallah.\n\nFor decades, under Congress Party governments, India’s approach to Israel was cautious, often filtered through domestic political considerations – India houses the world’s third-largest Muslim population – and historic sympathies for the Palestinian cause. The Congress Party criticized Modi’s upcoming visit, saying that his government has “abandoned” the Palestinians.\n\nUnder Congress Party governments, relations existed but largely below the radar. Modi changed that. He brought the relationship into full public view – and then expanded the ties dramatically.\n\nTrade has broadened beyond diamonds and agriculture into advanced technologies, cyber, renewable energy, and water management. Negotiations on a free trade agreement have advanced. Labor mobility agreements have brought thousands of Indian workers to Israel, with the Indian embassy putting the number of Indian citizens currently in Israel at some 42,000, excluding the more than 100,000 Jews of Indian origin.\n\nBut the core of the relationship is defense. And here, the numbers tell the story.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks international arms sales, between 2020 and 2024, one-third of Israel’s arms sales went to India. Jerusalem’s defense sales to New Delhi over the last decade have totaled just over $20 billion, and according to Forbes India, since the beginning of the year, the two countries have closed deals worth an eye-popping $8.6b.\n\nIsraeli systems in Indian service include air-defense platforms such as the Barak missile system, drones, radar systems, anti-tank missiles, and advanced surveillance technologies.\n\nThe defense relationship, however, has evolved. India’s “Make in India” doctrine requires substantial local production and technology transfer. Israeli defense firms now operate joint ventures and production lines in India.\n\nWhile Israel’s relationship with a number of traditional allies was strained by the war in Gaza, the relationship with India withstood the crisis.\n\nModi was among the first world leaders to condemn the October 7 attacks. But beyond rhetoric, cooperation reportedly continued in practical ways.\n\nAccording to foreign reports, when some Western countries slowed down and even embargoed weapons supplies to Israel during the war, New Delhi continued to supply military equipment.\n\nRemotely piloted aircraft produced in India were reportedly used to collect intelligence in Gaza, and joint production lines continued operating. India did not just issue statements of solidarity; it stepped up in practical ways.\n\nAlso, as some European governments distanced themselves from Israel and diplomatic pressure mounted, New Delhi maintained steady engagement.\n\nThat reliability, however, does not mean alignment on every regional issue.\n\nFor instance, India maintains longstanding ties with Iran – energy links and infrastructure projects, such as the development of Tehran’s Chabahar Port, which gives New Delhi access to Central Asia — as well as a long tradition of keeping its options open. India avoids rigid military blocs and resists being drawn into overtly anti-Iran alignments.\n\nModi will not present partnership with Israel – or participation in Netanyahu’s vision of a hexagon axis – as part of a formal coalition aimed at Tehran.\n\nHowever, if India is careful not to be seen as aligning against Iran, it has fewer reservations about counterbalancing Turkey’s growing regional footprint — particularly Ankara’s deepening embrace of Pakistan.\n\nIn recent years, Turkey has expanded defense and diplomatic coordination with Islamabad and taken positions on Kashmir that New Delhi views as hostile. At the same time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is implacably hostile to Israel. This creates a convergence of Indian and Israeli interests.\n\nAn expanded framework linking Israel, India, Greece, Cyprus, and select Arab states, such as the UAE – countries that also have strained relations with Ankara – offers India a strategic counterweight to Turkey’s ties with Pakistan.\n\nUltimately, there are two key messages in Modi’s visit.\n\nFirst, efforts to isolate Israel are neither universal nor fully effective. Major powers continue to operate according to their own interests, and strong ties with Israel are very much in India’s interests.\n\nSecond, Jerusalem continues to try to strengthen ties elsewhere, especially amid political and demographic changes in the US and Europe. As Netanyahu said at Sunday’s cabinet meeting, the close relationship with the US “does not mean we are not seeking additional alliances; on the contrary, we cultivate them constantly.”\n\nModi’s visit is one such act of cultivation. If Modi’s 2017 visit was a breakthrough in the relationship, his 2026 return signifies the consolidation of those ties.\n\nFor Netanyahu, it is an opportunity to demonstrate that, even amid diplomatic setbacks and challenges, Israel retains powerful partners and that, as alliances shift, Jerusalem can shift with them. The hexagon vision is one such example.\n\nAs Netanyahu said Sunday, much water has flowed in the Mediterranean, the Ganges, and the Jordan since Modi’s first visit nine years ago. At a time when some speak of Israel’s isolation, the image of India’s prime minister landing in Ben-Gurion highlights a partnership that has become a steady pillar of Israel’s foreign policy. The goal now is not merely to deepen the relationship but to make it indispensable to both sides.",

    "fullText": "New details about what really led Corey Lewandowski to sack a pilot during a meltdown on a U.S. Coast Guard plane have been exposed, revealing it wasn’t really a blanket at all.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her alleged lover and de facto chief of staff, Lewandowski, are both married with children, however, their alleged relationship has been described as “the worst-kept secret in D.C.”\n\nLewandowski reportedly entered the cockpit of a government jet in May last year, hunting down what was said to be a beloved heated blanket belonging to Noem that had been left behind after the alleged couple transferred aircraft when their original plane broke down.\n\nThe plane had reached 10,000 feet and the seatbelt sign was still on when Lewandowski reportedly addressed the pilot.\n\nHe threatened to fire the Coast Guard flight crew and then attempted to fire the pilot for refusing to return to the other plane to retrieve Noem’s possessions, sources cited by NBC said. He only relented after the pilot noted someone else would have to be found to fly the plane if he were dismissed from duty, according to the report.\n\nHowever new reporting by The Daily Mail quotes three DHS insiders saying it wasn’t a blanket left behind at all; it was a mystery bag.\n\n“This was never about a blanket,” an insider with knowledge of the incident told the Daily Mail. “The blanket was a cover story for what really happened. The whole thing was really about the bag that was left.”\n\nLewandowski had discovered that at least two people were aware of the contents of Noem’s bag, which could be embarrassing, the Mail reported, citing sources.\n\nThe fired pilot, Keith Thomas, a commanding officer for the Coast Guard in Washington, was later promoted to become a DHS senior adviser, the publication also pointed.\n\nThomas declined to comment on the plane incident, telling the Daily Mail, “As a military officer, I do not comment on past or current missions.”\n\nNoem’s aide on the infamous flight last May, Kamryn Jones, was awarded a Legion of Merit medal by her boss last September.\n\n“I am so proud of the patriots who serve our country and the DHS mission, including Lieutenant Commander Kamryn Jones of the U.S. Coast Guard,” Noem posted on Instagram. “I was honored to present her with the Legion of Merit for her extraordinary dedication as a military aide.”\n\nLewandowski told Reuters, “There was never a conversation in the cockpit when the flight was taking off,” but did not respond to questions about whether he entered the cockpit.\n\nLewandowski directed the Daily Beast to a statement from the Coast Guard saying that “no Coast Guard pilot was fired or received derogatory administrative action from any air station in connection with the incident described.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the DHS for comment.\n\nThis week Noem’s husband Bryon made a rare public appearance in the midst of ongoing rumors about her affair with Lewandowski.\n\nIn a video posted to Noem’s X account recorded at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the 54-year-old secretary can be seen standing in front of security. In the video, she tells viewers, “I’m just dropping off my husband, who’s headed back to South Dakota,” as she waves to her husband, Bryon Noem, who waves back as he walks through security.\n\nLewandowski is classified as a special government employee. He has been serving as Noem’s de facto chief of staff despite his position only allowing him to work 130 days a year.\n\nIn August, White House officials reportedly investigated whether Lewandowski had already exceeded those hours and was potentially fudging the numbers in order to remain by Noem’s side.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address to a ‌joint session of Congress on Tuesday, a potentially pivotal moment ‌as the White House seeks to firm up support among Republican voters ahead of November's ​midterm elections.\n\nTrump's speech comes against a backdrop of rising tensions with Iran and voter frustration with the high cost of living.\n\nTrump put dollars and cents at the heart of his speech, but he stuck to a risky ‌message on the economy ⁠that some strategists have warned could lose his Republican Party the congressional elections in November, when all 435 seats ⁠in the House and about a third of the Senate are in play. Democrats hope to take control from Republicans who have a majority in ​both chambers.\n\nIn ​Trump’s telling, inflation, mortgage rates and ​gas prices are falling, while ‌the stock market, oil production and foreign direct investment are booming along with construction and factory jobs. But he stopped short of acknowledging the pain that Americans still feel from rising prices, as he has in most of his recent speeches on the subject.\n\nThe data shows inflation stalled and ‌even ticked up last year, and the ​economy lost factory jobs last year.\n\nVoters tell ​pollsters they are anxious about ​the economy and are dissatisfied with Trump’s handling of ‌the issue. Fifty-six percent disapprove of ​his handling of ​the economy, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, while 36% approve.\n\nThat’s a reality strategists say Trump needs to reckon with if he’s going to be ​Republicans' chief messenger on ‌the economy as they fight to keep control of Congress in ​November’s midterm elections.",

Glen Rice weighs in\n\nBut that's exactly what The Sporting News did last week, having been granted the unique opportunity to chop it up with animatronic internet sensation Old Ball — as well as the three-headed brain trust behind his operation.\n\nThat brain trust is Funny or Die alums Ben Bayouth, Adam Aseraf and Christian Heuer, who now handle Old Ball's shenanigans via their own Benched Studios.\n\nOld Ball got a chance to hang out with NBA royalty at the Los Angeles Clippers' home arena, Intuit Dome, during All-Star Weekend.\n\nAs of this writing, Old Ball has notched over 438,000 Instagram followers and close to 250,000 TikTok fans.\n\nAfter talking with Bayouth, Aseraf and Heuer, The Sporting News got into it with Old Ball himself.\n\nThe Sporting News: Old Ball, what was your favorite moment of All-Star Weekend? Did you like the new All-Star game tournament format?\n\nOld Ball: \"Loved the new format. Ty Lue and Ballmer must have found the reboot button on Kawhi because that guy was automatic. My favorite moment was housing a bacon-wrapped hot dog outside Intuit Dome. My least favorite moment was discovering I am not built for street meat at 2 a.m.\"\n\nHow did you feel about this year’s Slam Dunk Contest?\n\n\"Look, Gary Payton Senior once told me there’s guys who dunk on people and guys who CREATE dunks. Gordon, LaVine, McClung – those are creators. I think we gotta get more creative with the dunks. Give me a Superman over a 7-footer. Give me a 360 windmill over a bonfire. Hang glide from the rafters and crater the Earth with your dunk supremacy. \"\n\nWould you have been comfortable being dunked? There were a lot of misses this year. It would probably not be ideal to have been Jase Richardson’s ball.\n\n\"Dunked? I watched the warmups and started updating my will. I need two pumps and a pep talk just to stay inflated.\"\n\nThere’s been a lot of chatter recently that All-Star Weekend is washed and needs a change. What would you alter about the format?\n\n\"I actually liked the format this year. Felt like those guys were playing hard. I think it’s all about having that one dude that doesn’t want to lose. This year, it was Wemby. He set the tone. You got in the lane with the Frenchman, you were gettin’ smeared into Creme Brulé.\"\n\nI’ve read in other interviews that you had a shot at the pros in the ’90s, and subsequently were in a shed for three decades. What do you miss most about ’90s basketball? What do you miss most about the shed?\n\n\"How about the mid-range jump shot? How about a 130-point game being a rarity? But I digress, these cats today have game – you can’t hate on that. As far as the shed, I miss those cold winter nights where I had nothing to entertain me except a rogue cob web the wind blew onto my face that wouldn’t fall off for months. Oh wait, I don’t miss that at all. Nah, dude. My shed days are over.\"",

    "fullText": "Braves manager Walt Weiss proves he was the right hire with one simple Ronald Acuna Jr. move originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are looking to right the wrongs of the 2025 season. Injuries were the biggest problem last year, preventing the team from finding a rhythm — and the same issue has already surfaced in 2026 with Spencer Schwellenbach sidelined.\n\n“The Braves opened camp this morning with an unwelcome update on talented young righty Spencer Schwellenbach. He’s been placed on the 60-day injured list due to inflammation in his right elbow, per Mark Bowman of MLB.com. The team’s hope is that the 25-year-old is dealing with bone spurs and not something more nefarious,” MLB Trade Rumors’ Steve Adams wrote.\n\nThe Braves also face future challenges when it comes to Ronald Acuña Jr., particularly regarding how to manage payroll.\n\n“The Braves must also account for future extensions for other core players, making payroll allocation a delicate exercise. Retaining Acuña long term is a priority, but accomplishing it will not be easy. Bellinger pulled in $162 million despite his up-and-down career thus far. Signing Acuña will almost certainly require more, both in total dollars and years,” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote. “With each big-money contract we see like Bellinger or Kyle Tucker or Bo Bichette, it feels increasingly likely that Ronald would have no trouble finding a deal worth at least $300 million if not significantly more.”\n\nNew manager Walt Weiss is already setting the tone for the team, making subtle but impactful moves in Spring Training.\n\n“A three-run first the day after benching the regulars. Walt is a genius,” Braves reporter Mark Bowman wrote.\n\nThis type of decision from Weiss has set a tone not just for the preseason, but for the regular season as well. Atlanta struggled offensively last year, and some believe former manager Brian Snitker’s laid-back approach may have been part of the problem.\n\nThe Braves are aiming for a big season, and moves like these will be critical for Weiss. Atlanta is determined to return to the playoffs after missing them for the first time in a long while.",

    "fullText": "Chiefs GM Brett Veach has broken the silence on speculation surrounding Travis Kelce’s retirement. Notably, the Chiefs missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and finished with a disappointing 6–11 record. Since then, the media has speculated that Kelce will retire soon. However, the Chiefs’ tight end has expressed his desire to continue his NFL career.\n\nChiefs GM Brett Veach gives an update on Travis Kelce amid retirement buzz and ahead of the 2026 NFL season. Interestingly, Veach’s comments come less than a week after the team’s head coach, Andy Reid, discussed Kelce’s retirement plans.\n\nVeach revealed that the team is focusing on regrouping and re-strategizing as Kelce’s future with the Chiefs remains undecided. On February 24, Veach shared in a press conference, “I think we’ve kind of taken a different approach with Travis in the sense that I think we’ve kind of prepared for either scenario.”\n\nThe Chiefs’ general manager also emphasized that they are in continuous contact with Kelce and are managing the situation through dialogue. Veach said, “Coach had mentioned on Friday that he’s had great dialogue with Travis on our end, myself, Chris Shea, Travis’ crew, we’ve had some good dialogue there — and I’m sure we’re going to see him here just like we will all the other players’ agents and we’ll continue that dialogue.”\n\nVeach recently wrapped up his 19th year in the NFL and ninth year with the Kansas City Chiefs. Towards the end, he lavished praise on the 36-year-old tight end and hoped that he would return to the Chiefs.\n\nVeach expressed, “Travis is the best, he’s an icon, hopefully he comes back and we’ll just kind of let that process play out.”\n\nPreviously, Coach Andy Reid disclosed that Kelce had casually discussed the matter with him but hadn’t conveyed his final decision yet. Reid said (via NFL Media), “No, there is communication, though. That’s the main thing. I’ve said this before: As long as there’s communication, I’m good. That means people want to move forward. I think that’s where Trav is. I’m not trying to put words in his mouth at all, and I try to give him some space here.”\n\nThe post Chiefs GM Gives Update on Travis Kelce Ahead of 2026 Season appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Four Arizona Cardinals are set to get raises in 2026, and it isn't because of a contract extension. These players have earned league \"proven performance\" salary escalators.\n\nPlayers not orginally drafted in the first round can earn fourth-year salary escalators, based on playing time and/or recognition.\n\nThe details come from the collective bargaining agreement, via Over the Cap.\n\nThe Level One PPE is earned if a player participates in a certain percentage of a team's offensive or defensive snaps in two of his first three seasons, or averages that percentage of offensive or defensive snaps over his entire first three years. For 2nd round picks, the average is 60%, and (as was the same in the 2011 CBA) for 3rd-7th round picks it is 35%.\n\nThe Level Two PPE is earned if a player participates in at least 55% of a team's offensive or defensive snaps in all of his first three seasons.\n\nThe Level Three PPE is earned if a player is selected to a Pro Bowl on the original ballot (not as an alternate) in any of his first three seasons.\n\nA level-one player will make the salary of a restricted free agent original-round tender — about $3.6 million.\n\nA level-two escalator will get the level-one salary, plus $250,000 (about $3.85 million)\n\nA level-three escalator will earn the salary of a second-round restricted free agent tender, more than $5.8 million.\n\nThree players earned level-one escalators.\n\nWilliams, Stills and Higgins will make about $3.6 million in salary in 2026. Stills and Higgins were scheduled to make the league minimum of $1.145 million.\n\nOne player — receiver Michael Wilson — qualified for level 2, so he will make more than $3.85 million in 2026.\n\nWilliams will likely start the season on injured reserve. The rest will have their roles again.\n\nWilson could see a contract extension.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "“Few newly promoted sides have managed what we have recently; there are even fewer fan bases that could ever be as passionate as we are, week in, week out. It is important that we remember this”, writes Milo Challis.",
    "fullText": "Sunderland’s second home loss of the season came against Fulham in what was a pretty terrible spectacle. However, the reaction to the loss – and not the poor performances on the pitch – are arguably the main talking point from a disappointing weekend.\n\nThe 3-1 loss to Fulham was a poor watch. Two dismal performances came from two teams who showed precious little quality for much of the game. Fulham eked out a win from being the more clinical of the two teams, but 4 goals flattered what was perhaps the worst game of football we’ve seen at the SoL this season.\n\nYet despite the poorness of the performance, some perspective is necessary. Sunderland sit 12th in the table with 9 wins, 9 draws, and 9 losses – perfectly balanced, some might say. This is, by no means, an awful place to be, and whilst this predicament is less than ideal considering our excellent start to the season, we need to remain level-headed in our expectations.\n\nSunderland have exceeded expectations all season. We have played well and deserve every one of the 36 points we have won so far. Whilst there are doubts creeping in from the fanbase regarding our defensive acumen of late, it’s important to stick behind the team and trust that we will return to the form we showed at the start of the season.\n\nIt was saddening, therefore, to see people streaming out of the ground well before the whistle – especially considering how well we’ve played in every other game at home this season. For a club who have a penchant for scoring last-minute goals and whose slogan is literally ‘Til the End’, it was frustrating to see the stands almost empty by the time the final whistle eventually sounded.\n\nAs the club’s recent season ticket renewal drive has highlighted, the home crowd this season has been vital to our impressive season. This showed at times during the Fulham game: this crowd is loud and brutal and a genuine fear for teams visiting.\n\nBut it needs to be present for the entire game. These lads on the pitch are only human, and watching thousands of fans stream out after conceding a third goal doesn’t bode well for the confidence on the pitch.\n\nMany fans will argue with this sentiment. I’m sure many will tell me that as loyal fans they felt let down by the performance and wanted their frustrations acknowledged. I can understand this, but I can’t agree with it. Whilst it is fair to feel let down and frustrated by a game where we were so off the pace from our normal form, it hardly feels fair on the team that the ground empties after one poor performance.\n\nInterviews from Ballard and O’Nien support this notion. As a club, we knew we were in for a tough ride at times in our first season back. The players and playing staff have admitted as much themselves, but it is to their testament – and ours as a loyal fanbase – that these big losses have come few and far between this season.\n\nSunderland will bounce back. Xhaka’s return will make certain of that, but it is important to remain strong and as committed as ever. Once again, the lads are human. Form is temporary and will fluctuate; that’s natural, but it will be much easier for the lads to regain with the full voice and confidence of the 12th man behind them.\n\nContinuing on the vein of humanity, it has been tough to see the horrendous abuse Mundle has received in the light of Sunday’s loss. It is tough to see a young player scapegoated, yet a worrying trend has begun – especially with a culture of outing specific players.\n\nUnfortunately, it feels like the abuse Mundle has been getting has been the natural escalation of an unacceptable smear campaign. Criticism will always be a natural part of the game, but an unhealthy obsession with pointing out one player’s flaws should not be.\n\nFortunately, it will only ever be a minority of people who feel the need to react so poorly. Furthermore, it is still to be seen whether the abusers are genuinely Sunderland fans or chancers who don’t understand enough about our game to know or comprehend that football isn’t played by one man alone but a team of people of backgrounds and origins from far and wide.\n\nPlayers like Mundle bring immense value to the team because they bring different styles and different abilities. He will always be a valued member of this team for two simple reasons: the first being the role he played in our success last season, the effort and passion he brought in the fallout of losing our best player at the time and what he did to make the position his. The second is that he has so much more yet to give.\n\nMundle was electric against Oxford and showed us what a talent he really is. What he needs now is the weight of the world’s best fanbase behind him – arms around him and lifting him up. With the wages these players are on, it is often easy to lose ourselves in the performance side of football, which too often makes us forget that lads like Mundle are only 22 – all young men doing their best to kick on and grow.\n\nRomaine is also representative of a larger group of players in this Sunderland squad: a band of players with those diverse backgrounds I alluded to earlier. If Mundle is receiving abuse based on the colour of his skin, his ethnicity and his background, what impression does that give the other players on our side?\n\nSunderland AFC is wonderfully diverse. The city and its fans welcomed me as someone who had fallen in love with the place, despite being born outside the city’s boundaries. It is important that we look at this situation and realise our influence as the Red and White army. This piece does not serve as a rant, nor is it a demand for better. But it’s a reminder of actually quite how brilliant we are. Few newly promoted sides have managed what we have recently; there are even fewer fan bases that could ever be as passionate as we are, week in, week out. It is important that we remember as much, it is important that we now circle around our own, and it is imperative that we do what we can to push our lads onwards and upwards. Haway the lads.",

    "description": "Goodchild’s first-half hat-trick may have sent shock waves to White Hart Lane, but fear not Spurs he will probably not be selected!",
    "fullText": "Spurs wily manager Bill Nicholson watched from the Elland Road stands as Sunderland blew Leeds away in a first-half display of skill, pace and power.\n\nWith his Spurs side making the journey to Roker Park the following Saturday in the 6th Round of the FA Cup and with the Black Cats having already seen off Arsenal and Liverpool as well as Norwich, Nicholson had plenty to think about if his dream of being the first manager to steer a side to the double of league and FA Cup winners was to materialise.\n\nHe would not have known whether to laugh or cry upon hearing the news after the game that Sunderland’s hat-trick hero Ralphy Goodchild (who could have easily scored five let alone three), would probably not be selected for the cup tie if young maestro Willie McPheat had recovered from his ankle injury. The Spurs boss must have wondered how good McPheat was, given Goodchild had a magnificent game and took his three goals with some style.\n\nBoth Leeds and Sunderland were hovering just below Liverpool, Ipswich, Middlesbrough and Sheffield United who were jostling for the two promotion spots.\n\nLeeds had beaten Sunderland at Roker Park earlier in the season when two former players — player/coach Don Revie and Colin Grainger (the Singing Winger) — had inspired a two-goal half-time lead that Sunderland could not claw back as they lost a nip-and-tuck game by three goals to two.\n\nRevie was not fit for this game, but Colin Grainger would be playing, alongside future Scotland captain Billy Bremner and future England centre-half Jack Charlton (who would go on to spend his entire playing career with Leeds from 1950-1973).\n\nSunderland’s results had improved as the season had progressed and the side (especially the defence) became more settled. Injuries in the forward line meant that apart from nineteen-year-old Ralphy Goodchild coming in for his first game of the season for McPheat, eighteen-year-old John Dillon retained his place on the wing for the experienced Jack Overfield, who was still making his way back after injury. The young Scot had made his debut against Middlesbrough in September of this season and had taken his chance in mid-January with Overfield’s injury, getting better game on game to the point of which it was not a foregone conclusion that Overfield would start once fit again!\n\nThe game got off to a rip-roaring start (if you were a Sunderland fan). Sunderland ripped Leeds apart in a first half that had the Black Cats positively purring and the Peacocks running around like frantic chickens.\n\nGoodchild might have scored in the very first minute as he missed a ‘sitter’ only a few yards out and with only goalkeeper Humphries to beat.\n\nWith Stan Anderson and Jim McNab pulling the strings Sunderland took the lead with a well-worked goal on four minutes. Dillon found Goodchild with an inside pass, he squared it to Ian Lawther whose powerful shot deflected off Charlton on the way into the net.\n\nTwo minutes later Lawther charging down the left wing slid a pass to McNab who managed to stab the ball forward to Goodchild as he was tackled. ‘Ralphy’ was on this in a flash and hit an accurate low shot past the despairing dive of Humphries to take a two-goal lead.\n\nIt only took four further minutes for Lawther to feed Goodchild racing into the box. His powerful shot cannoned off the post and into the back of the net. Three goals in eight minutes was devastating football, Leeds responded by giving Jack Charlton licence to roam upfield but this only served to create more space for the eager Sunderland forwards.\n\nOn twenty-four minutes Leeds did pull a goal back. Colin Nelson was having a right old tussle with Colin Grainger (honours even at the end of this game). Nelson was harshly adjudged to have fouled Grainger just outside the box. The singing winger hit the right note with Leeds fans as he got up to blast the free-kick at goal. His shot hit an outstretched Nelson leg but fell kindly to Smith lurking three yards out, who prodded the ball past Wakeham in the Sunderland goal.\n\nFor the next quarter of an hour there was no further scoring, but the Lads created two very good chances that were spurned and Jack Charlton had a powerful header well saved by Wakeham. Had this gone in it could have made the second half quite interesting to say the least. It was Sunderland though who scored just before half-time to put the game almost out of Leeds reach. This goal started with a great pass out of defence from McNab to Lawther. The Belfast-born centre-forward fed the ball on to Goodchild, who speeding forward, beat his marker and slammed the ball past Humphries for a first-half hat-trick.\n\nAfter such a devastating first half, the second half was a tamer affair. Sunderland with one eye on the big game to come the following weekend contained Leeds to the extent that it was not until the eighty-third minute that a shot was registered on Wakeham’s goal. It was a very good shot from Billy Bremner from twenty yards out and did angle past Wakeham for United’s second goal, but it did not affect the result of this game.\n\nAlf Greenly, writing in the Journal, was full of praise for the team’s performance. Claiming the first-half performance would have demolished better teams than Leeds, who for forty-five minutes were completely outclassed. Stan Anderson and Jim McNab were singled out for the effective manner in which they broke up Leeds attacks and kept feeding their forward line with a good range of long and short passes. There were honourable mentions for Len Ashurst and his total domination of Leeds winger Francis and Colin Nelson’s battle with Colin Grainger. Greenly of course donated much print to the hat-trick hero Ralphy Goodchild, describing him as “the happiest man in the Sunderland party”. Greenly went on to praise the attitude of the team in general and Goodchild in particular who he explained did not expect to be playing in the big cup tie against Spurs the following weekend but had no complaints! In fact, Ralphy anticipated (correctly) that he would be turning out at Barrow in the North Regional League for Sunderland reserves rather than a packed Roker Park against the best team in the top tier!\n\nSunderland went on to play an historic cup tie against Spurs the following week in front of 61,000 fans. Willie McPheat not only returned from injury for this game, but scored the equaliser that prompted Spurs captain Danny Blanchflower to say “I have never known a crowd atmosphere like the one here at Roker. I could not hear myself think let alone shout instructions. We were very relieved to hear the final whistle and to still be in the competition…..It was almost as if they sucked the ball into the net”.\n\n1960/61 saw Spurs historically do the double that season for the very first time, Bill Nicholson would acknowledge the closest his team came to failing that season was in the cup tie at Roker Park.\n\nMeanwhile on a field far away (in Barrow) Ralphy Goodchild would not know that his hat-trick for Sunderland at Elland Road would be his last game for the Lads. Despite a very healthy 21 goals in 45 appearances he was transferred to Brighton in May 1961. He went on to score 44 goals in 163 games for the Seagulls between May 1961 and June 1966 having helped Albion win promotion from the fourth division. He then returned to the North East spending a season with York (1966/67) and a brief cameo with Darlington in 1967/68.\n\nSunderland finished the 1960/61 season in sixth position, their challenge fading in the final ten games which saw five defeats and a draw. Leeds faded badly and finished in fourteenth position. Both teams would eventually fight out a titanic struggle for promotion and the second division title in 1963/64.\n\nIt seems to have been a case of what might have been for the likable Goodchild who passed away aged seventy-two in 2011. Reflecting on his career in a Northern Echo article in 2005 Ralphy was humble and generous about his career. He acknowledged Willie McPheat as a very good player and emphasised he was “still very proud to have played for Sunderland”.\n\nDivision Two (25.02.1961) — Elland Road (15,100)\n\nGoal-scorers – Lawther 4 mins; Goodchild 6, 8 & 40 mins.\n\nSmith 24 mins; Bremner 83 mins.\n\nLeeds – Humphries; Jones; Hair; Cameron; Charlton; Goodwin; Francis; Smith; McCole; Bremner; Grainger.\n\nSunderland – Wakeham; Nelson; Ashurst; Anderson; Hurley; McNab; Hooper; Fogarty; Lawther; Goodchild; Dillon.",

    "description": "There’s an international break coming up for Sunderland Women - how will this affect Mel Reay’s squad?",
    "fullText": "International breaks can sometimes feel like an interruption to the rhythm of a club season, but for Sunderland Women, this one serves as a powerful reminder of who they are becoming. Seven players have been called up across four nations, spanning senior World Cup qualifiers and youth international fixtures. Not one of these selections is unexpected. Every player involved is already a recognised figure within their national programme, and their call-ups reflect continuity, trust and the calibre of footballer Sunderland now attract and develop.\n\nFor a club that has rebuilt itself with patience and purpose, this international window is not merely a point of pride. It is a statement about Sunderland’s trajectory. The squad is no longer a collection of promising Championship players quietly working under the radar. It is a group whose influence stretches across continents, whose talent is acknowledged at the highest levels, and whose presence on the international stage feels entirely natural.\n\nKatie Kitching’s involvement with New Zealand is a perfect example. Her selection for the Football Ferns’ World Cup qualifiers is not a surprise, nor is it a sudden breakthrough. Kitching has been part of New Zealand’s plans for some time, and her performances for Sunderland have only reinforced her standing. She has been one of the club’s most consistent and influential players since she arrived, combining technical quality with intelligence and a relentless work ethic. Her ability to link midfield and attack, to carry the ball with purpose, and to dictate tempo has made her indispensable on Wearside.\n\nFor New Zealand, she offers versatility and composure in high-pressure fixtures. For Sunderland, her international involvement is another layer in her development, exposing her to different tactical demands and the intensity of knockout-style football. Her call-up is not a reward for a purple patch; it is a continuation of her established role within a national team preparing for a crucial qualifying campaign.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland contingent reflects a group of players who are already firmly embedded in their national setup, each at different stages of their international journey. Jamie Finn, Grace Moloney and Marissa Sheva are all familiar figures within the Irish squad, and their call-ups for World Cup qualifiers are entirely consistent with their standing.\n\nFinn, with more than twenty caps to her name, has long been a trusted figure for Ireland. Her versatility, tactical intelligence and composure have made her a reliable presence in green, just as they have in red and white. At Sunderland she has been a model of consistency, adapting seamlessly to different roles and offering a level of maturity that anchors the team around her. Her selection is not news; it is simply the continuation of a career that has already earned significant international respect.\n\nMoloney’s inclusion reflects her growing importance within the Irish goalkeeping group. With nine caps, she is still in the earlier stages of her international career, but she has quickly established herself as a dependable option. Her performances for Sunderland have shown her authority and shot-stopping qualities that translate naturally to the international stage. Her call-up is a recognition of her upward trajectory and the trust she has earned in recent windows.\n\nSheva, meanwhile, brings twenty caps’ worth of experience to the Irish forward line. Her energy, directness and relentless work rate have made her a valuable asset for Ireland, just as they have for Sunderland. She is a player who stretches defences, presses intelligently and offers versatility across the front line. Her involvement in the qualifiers is entirely expected, reflecting her established role within the squad and the consistency of her contributions.\n\nWales have also turned to Sunderland for their World Cup qualifiers, selecting Rhiannon Roberts and Mared Griffiths. Roberts is one of the most experienced internationals in the squad, a player whose leadership and defensive intelligence have been central to Wales’ progress in recent years. Her presence at Sunderland has already proven invaluable, offering guidance to younger players and stability in key moments. Her call-up is a continuation of a distinguished international career, and her performances in the WSL2 have shown that she remains a player of significant quality.\n\nGriffiths’ selection comes at a very different moment in her club journey. Having only just joined Sunderland on loan from Manchester United in January 2026, she has not yet made her debut for the club. Her call-up, therefore, is not a reflection of her time on Wearside but of her established standing within the Welsh national setup. A talented and composed midfielder, Griffiths has been steadily building her international profile, and her involvement in Wales’ qualifiers is a natural continuation of that trajectory. For Sunderland, her arrival and immediate international involvement underline the calibre of player the club is now able to attract.\n\nNew loan signing, Caragh Hamilton has also been called up for Northern Ireland. Interestingly enough on their announcement graphic as a ‘forward’ which surprise a few fans myself included. Although she is listed as a defender at club level, Northern Ireland have frequently used her higher up the pitch as a midfielder and winger, where her energy, ball carrying and pressing suit the demands of international football.\n\nHamilton’s inclusion in the Northern Ireland squad for the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2027 qualifiers against Switzerland and Turkiye is a deserved recognition of her consistency and experience at international level. Hamilton has been a senior Northern Ireland international since 2012 and has accumulated 53 caps and 7 goals for her country, making her one of the squad’s most seasoned players. Her versatility, experience and tactical intelligence make her an important asset as Northern Ireland look to build momentum in their World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nMared Griffiths’ call up to the Wales senior squad for their upcoming fixtures is another important step in the rise of one of the most exciting young midfielders in British football. Still only eighteen, Griffiths has already made four senior appearances for Wales and scored once, building on an impressive youth international record that includes fifteen caps and three goals for the under seventeen side and six caps and one goal for the under nineteen team.\n\nShe plays primarily as a midfielder for Wales, operating with intelligence, energy and a natural ability to carry the ball through tight spaces. Her recent performances at club level, including her sensational long range goal on her Sunderland debut, have only strengthened her reputation as a player with enormous potential. Wales have used her in central and advanced midfield roles, trusting her creativity and composure in possession. Her ongoing development at Sunderland, combined with her growing international experience, makes her an increasingly important figure for Wales as they build towards future qualification campaigns.\n\nCompleting the list is Ella West, called up to Scotland’s Under-19 squad for a series of friendlies. While youth international fixtures may not carry the same weight as senior qualifiers, they are crucial in shaping the careers of young players. West has been on Scotland’s radar for some time, and her selection is a continuation of her involvement at youth level. For her, this is an opportunity to test herself against high-quality opposition, to experience the demands of international football, and to continue her development in an environment designed to challenge and elevate young talent.\n\nHer call-up also reflects Sunderland’s long-standing commitment to youth development. The club has a proud history of producing players who go on to represent their countries, and West’s inclusion continues that tradition. She is a player with significant potential, and her international involvement will only enrich her understanding of the game.\n\nTaken together, these call-ups paint a picture of a squad that is both diverse and deeply talented. Sunderland Women are no longer a team quietly rebuilding in the Championship; they are a club whose players are shaping international campaigns, influencing World Cup qualifiers, and representing their nations with pride. The breadth of call-ups, spanning New Zealand, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, speaks to the global reach of the squad and the quality that runs through it.\n\nFor the club, this international break is a moment to reflect on the progress made in recent years. Sunderland have built a squad that blends experience with youth, international pedigree with domestic promise. The players called up are not fringe figures or occasional squad members; they are central to their national teams’ plans. That level of recognition is not accidental. It is the result of careful recruitment, strong coaching and a culture that encourages players to grow, compete and aspire.\n\nThere is also a practical benefit. Players who compete internationally return with sharpened instincts, heightened confidence and a deeper understanding of the game. They bring back lessons learned from facing different styles, different systems and different pressures. That experience filters into the squad, raising standards and enriching the team’s tactical awareness.\n\nOf course, international duty also brings challenges. Travel, fatigue and the risk of injury are always considerations. But for Sunderland, the positives far outweigh the concerns. Having so many players involved in international football enhances the club’s reputation, attracts new talent and reinforces the message that Sunderland is a place where careers can flourish.\n\nAs the league resumes, the returning internationals will bring with them the momentum of representing their countries. They will return to a squad that has grown in confidence and cohesion, ready to push forward in the WSL2. And they will carry with them the pride of having worn their national colours, knowing that they are part of a club that supports and celebrates their ambitions.\n\nThis international break is not a pause for Sunderland Women. It is a milestone, a marker of how far the club has come and a glimpse of where it is heading. With players competing on the world stage, the future looks bright, ambitious and full of possibility. And when they return to Wearside, they will do so not just as Sunderland players, but as representatives of nations, carrying experience that will only strengthen the team’s journey ahead.",

    "fullText": "In the clip, Parikh was seen circling Miller, with the caption “David Miller! What a player” and the on-screen line “I thought we were friends, David.”\n\nSoon after, Parikh claimed she started receiving serious online abuse, including rape threats and body-shaming comments. Because of this, she deleted the video from Facebook but kept it on Instagram, and said she plans to file a police complaint over the threats.\n\nSouth Africa crushed India by 76 runs in their first Super Eight match of the T20 World Cup 2026 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, leaving India in a must-win situation for their remaining two games to reach the semifinals. \n\nChasing 188, India were bowled out for just 111 in 18.5 overs, ending their 12-match T20 World Cup winning streak.\n\nIndia’s chase collapsed early, with Ishan Kishan and Tilak Varma falling cheaply. Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma tried to rebuild, but Sharma was dismissed in the fifth over. \n\nWashington Sundar and Yadav also failed to build partnerships, and although Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube added 35 runs, regular wickets kept India under pressure.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL Draft is still close to two months away, but some fan bases have been looking ahead to the draft since December or earlier. After a long wait, the NFL Combine will offer the best look yet at the top players available in April.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be surprising to see some of the elite-level talent atop big boards sit out of drills at the combine, the weekend annually helps some prospects build their stock. Others, meanwhile, can raise more questions than answers about their NFL potential.\n\nIt was a year ago that South Carolina safety Nick Emmanwori put on a show at the NFL Combine, proving to be every bit the athletic freak many were hoping to see. While it wasn't enough to push him into the first round, his athleticism wasn't worth overlooking: Emmanwori helped the Seahawks win a Super Bowl and looks like yet another young building block for their loaded defense.\n\nThe next Emmanwori could announce himself to the football world in Indianapolis this weekend.\n\nHere's what you need to know to watch the NFL Combine, including TV channel and live streams.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Combine workouts and drills will air live on the NFL Network and can be streamed with Fubo, which offers a free trial.\n\nThe on-field portion of the NFL Combine will again be held at Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts.

    "description": "Despite recent results, RR reader Peter Milton is confident that we can turn it around soon!",
    "fullText": "I have been reading with interest the comments regarding the crowd during certain matches at the Stadium of Light, and most of the comments are bang on the button.\n\nI don’t know what it is, but we seem to become a bit fatigued as the season wears on.\n\nI think we maybe got caught up in the hype about how brilliant we are and once the home record went against Liverpool, we fell somewhat flat. We were noticeably unremarkable against Fulham — disrespect meant whatsoever, but had we been playing Arsenal at home after Liverpool, I have no doubt the rafters would’ve been coming off. However, we have to do our bit on the terraces.\n\nLet’s not forget that the team is made up largely of kids, albeit they’re cracking players on their day.\n\nThey thrive on the support we give them, and if we are flat, they will unfortunately feed off that. We’re still not mathematically safe and we need to focus on that and forget all the nonsensical talk of Europe. If it happens, wonderful, but let’s get realistic first; let’s all get our second wind and make it as uncomfortable as we possibly can for Brighton.\n\nFor the first time since Reidy was here, I genuinely believe we’re all in this together. We have to get this team across the line, and we need to be cheering every tackle, every ball won and every pass made, so let’s frighten Brighton to death.\n\nWe can do it. We all know we have the most intimidating atmosphere in the Premier League when we are all up for it. Let’s get at them and make it known we’re all back at full force.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Peter. Thank you for your letter.\n\nYou raise some very interesting points and I do agree that against Fulham in particular, we did look a bit jaded and disjointed — a far cry from the team we’ve been for much of the season.\n\nWas that due to fatigue, tactical issues or just a lack of confidence? It’s difficult to say and it was a very disappointing day all round, but I do think the fact that we have two challenging away games before we return to the Stadium of Light could be beneficial.\n\nIf we can find the solutions to our troubles on the road and pick up positive results against Bournemouth and Leeds, the visit of Brighton will take on a different feel altogether and hopefully everyone will be bang up for it. There’s still a lot for us to play for this season and I hope that message is being reiterated by Granit Xhaka and Régis Le Bris.\n\nWhat’s with all the negativity?\n\nWe’re fine. Stop being ridiculous.\n\nSome of our fans are in danger of spoiling this season.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi Gerald. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nI agree that there have been some slightly over-the-top reactions to recent results and performances, but at the same time, it’s fair to say that the Lads aren’t hitting the standards they’ve previously set for themselves and that we need to fix the issues we’re currently facing.\n\nIt’s not a crisis but it is a slump, and we need to turn it around if 2025/2026 is to end on the same kind of positive note on which it started back in August.",

    "fullText": "Ryan Woodman missed out on the Six Nations, but the promising Dragons forward has been backed to be in the Wales squad at next year's World Cup.\n\nThe 22-year-old blind-side flanker, who can also play lock, is on Steve Tandy's radar and trained with the Test squad last month.\n\nHe is a leading option if Wales need reinforcements for Ireland and Italy after losing flanker Taine Plumtree and lock Rhys Davies to injury.\n\nDragons defence coach Dale MacLeod is confident Woodman will make an international breakthrough soon, and tips him to be mixing it with the world's best in Australia next year.\n\n\"He is a talent and I have no doubt that he will be in the group that goes to the World Cup,\" said MacLeod.\n\nCardiff coach Van Zyl holds talks with Benetton\n\nMurchie to join Wales as defence coach in summer\n\n'Life in Welsh rugby' but stats show issues remain\n\nThe former Wales Under-20s captain will feature for Dragons against Benetton at Rodney Parade on Saturday (17:30 GMT).\n\n\"It's really important that we manage him and don't get him there too early,\" said MacLeod about the forward's international ambitions.\n\n\"He got the opportunity train with Wales and it's so good when young men get a small taste of it.\n\n\"I think it's critical that they get a taste rather than getting thrown in and it was great for him because he is a super talent.\n\n\"I believe he has the attributes to become world class, it's just how we manage, grow and develop him.\n\n\"Steve and his coaching group are doing a great job and I love how they are growing the next lot of players.\"\n\nWoodman made his Dragons debut in 2023 and has made 42 appearances.\n\nHe has featured in 12 of 15 games this season, showing his versatility with two starts in the second row.\n\n\"Aerially he is outstanding, whether at the line-out or catching high balls. On the edges he has a good skill set and is growing his collisions and physicality,\" said Macleod.\n\n\"Being a tall lad that will take a bit of time, but he's right across the game whether in defence or attack. He adds so much value on both sides of the ball.\"",

    "description": "From a courtside meeting in Los Angeles to a September superfight in Las Vegas, the inside story of how Mayweather vs. Pacquiao 2 finally came together.",
    "fullText": "In 2019, the Los Angeles Clippers were cruising toward a routine win over the Charlotte Hornets at Staples Center. Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell were cooking, and at some point the lead extended to a 20-point margin.\n\nBut the moment that would travel furthest that night had nothing to do with basketball.\n\nClad in Gucci, Floyd Mayweather Jr. — sitting close enough he could have jabbed a Hornet if he wanted — turned and smirked when he spotted Manny Pacquiao right behind him.\n\nPacquiao stopped, smiled at him and then dapped his old rival.\n\nOne camera caught the interaction from point-blank range and the clip was soon slowed down, mythologized, and replayed like a deleted scene from a saga that never quite reached its final act.\n\nThey meet again. Only here.@mannypacquiao | @FloydMayweather | #ClipperNation pic.twitter.com/OQrezLim14\n\n— LA Clippers (@LAClippers) January 9, 2019\n\nFour years earlier, the welterweight greats produced 4.7 million pay-per-view buys by engaging in one of the most meaningful sporting events of all time. Mayweather won convincingly, and has fought professionally just once since. Pacquiao, now age 46, improbably continues to look threatening in the ring.\n\nThat night courtside in Los Angeles, Pacquiao met someone else, too — someone who would help shape his business, and everything that followed.\n\nEnter Jas Mathur, the CEO of Pacquiao Promotions and a pivotal figure in finally getting their second fight across the line.\n\n\"This rematch has been talked about for a long time,\" Mathur told Uncrowned on Tuesday, one day after Netflix's announcement that it is airing the spectacle live, worldwide, on Sept. 19.\n\nMathur said \"many deals\" for a Mayweather rematch were put forth to Manny Pacquiao Promotions since their chance meeting in 2019, but \"nothing was ever serious,\" with too many \"middle men trying to skim off of it, twist and turn words, or just block the deal because they wanted to be the ones to present it.\"\n\nIt took the right performance — and the right platform — to finally change that.\n\nThe right performance was Pacquiao’s comeback in 2025, when he rolled back the clock to put a pace on Mario Barrios the then-champion was only able to contain in the latter part of their WBC title fight.\n\nWhile Pacquiao fell controversially short of making history as the second-oldest world champion ever in boxing, Mayweather, 49, watched July's majority draw with interest. As did Netflix.\n\n\"Netflix wouldn't want him [this year] if the performance [against Barrios] wasn't good,” Mathur said. \"Floyd saw Manny come back and obviously got the itch himself. In Floyd's mind, he's 50-0, and one of the greatest boxers ever … but so is Manny.\n\n\"Netflix feels this is going to be their biggest event in sports history, and it's going to open up whole new markets internationally.\"\n\nRegardless, there were still obstacles in dragging the rematch across the finish line, and the first was non-negotiable: A pro fight, or nothing at all.\n\n\"Manny had no interest in doing an exhibition with Floyd,\" Mathur said. \"Either [Mayweather's undefeated record] is on the line, or there was no deal.\"\n\nThere was no deal more than a decade ago when drug-testing continually torpedoed the initial conversations around the first Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, “but there’s no issue” on drug-testing this time, per Mathur, with Mayweather’s preference being the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).\n\nMayweather also experienced licensing issues when he had to take a Logan Paul exhibition in 2021 to Miami after the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) refused to sanction it as a Las Vegas show. But Pacquiao isn’t Paul, and the NAC “have no concerns whatsoever,” said Mathur.\n\n\"It's a sanctioned fight and the date's already reserved with [NAC]. They're both cleared and have had their medicals done.\"\n\nNetflix, he says, is what made all the difference.\n\n\"One of the biggest factors in it being a smoother negotiation this time around than last is because it's Netflix,” he said. “A partnership that gives us access to 325 million-plus global subscribers, and international exposure.\"\n\nAdd Las Vegas' famed Sphere to the equation, which showcased its potential as a blockbuster fight venue with UFC 306 in late 2024, and you have \"a great venue for entertainment … that allows Netflix to show off the quality of the production of what they can do, amplifying everything on another level.\"\n\nAs the fight is not until September, both boxers have been linked with warm-up exhibitions.\n\nBut while Mayweather appears set to box a glorified spar with Mike Tyson in April, it's unlikely Pacquiao will engage his former training partner Ruslan Provodnikov in a previously-reported exhibition bout.\n\n\"That fight is not confirmed, and there's a breach,” Mathur said. “So we're in the process of dealing with it.\n\n“Is there a possibility of a Manny exhibition prior to Mayweather? Yes. Do I personally feel it's going to be that fight? No.\"\n\nWhatever warmup bout Pacquiao lands, it won't be one that risks compromising what comes next. Those sorts of challenges will come after — whether it’s a world title shot or something else.\n\nPacquiao himself told Uncrowned last year he intends to be active in this surprising late-career run. And though he was seemingly screwed out of a win against Barrios — which would have broken his own record as the oldest welterweight champion in boxing history — he still has world title aspirations.\n\n\"If the opportunity presents itself, he definitely wants to [fight for a championship],\" Mathur said. \"There was the whole thing of him fighting [WBA welterweight world champion] Rolly [Romero] in a pro fight — that's something that can always get done at some point.\"\n\nThat opportunity vanishes, though, with a loss to Mayweather.\n\nBut for Pacquiao and Mathur, there’s only one result in mind. They want that win in September so they can force Mayweather to experience something he's never had to previously consider: Defeat.",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers emphatically got back to winning ways Tuesday, coasting to a 109-94 victory over the New York Knicks as their recent star signing James Harden scored 20 points.\n\nThe Cavs took the lead barely a minute into the game with an Evan Mobley three-pointer, and never gave it up in a thoroughly comfortable night for the red-hot Ohio franchise.\n\nFormer NBA Most Valuable Player Harden, who was brought in from the Los Angeles Clippers this month, has never won a championship despite being one of the most decorated players in the league.\n\nThat was a key factor in his move to the seemingly playoff-bound Cavs, where he has only suffered one loss across seven games, and \"The Beard\" excelled again, providing four assists against the Knicks.\n\n\"We're working to build something special, and each game is an opportunity to get better,\" said Harden. \"Tonight was a good step for us.\"\n\nIt was a return to form after their seven-game winning streak was snapped Sunday by the defending champions Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nHarden, 36, has given Cleveland another strong offensive threat alongside Donovan Mitchell, who led the scoring with 23 points.\n\nThe victory was underpinned by a powerful defensive performance, that saw the Knicks' star man Jalen Brunson restricted to 20 points.\n\n\"Tonight it was a team effort, and it's been like that since I've been here. That's one of the beauties about this team, any guy can get it going,\" added Harden.\n\nThey drew level on 37 wins and 22 losses with the Knicks -- third in the Eastern Conference -- who were poor with their shooting accuracy, making just 11 points in a shocking third quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Anthony Edwards poured in 34 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves earned a hard-fought 124-121 win against the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nEdwards -- MVP at this month's All-Star Game -- managed 25 of his points in an explosive first half.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets beat the Chicago Bulls 131-99, with rookie Kon Knueppel racing to his 200th three-pointer.\n\nAged 20, the Hornets prodigy is the fastest player to reach that mark in NBA history, requiring just 58 games.\n\nTyrese Maxey sank 32 points plus nine rebounds and eight assists as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Indiana Pacers 135-114.\n\nThe Pacers reached last year's NBA Finals, but have struggled badly this campaign, sinking to the very bottom of the East.\n\nCongolese forward Jonathan Kuminga scored 27 points on his debut for the Atlanta Hawks in a 119-98 win over the Washington Wizards.\n\nThe Western Conference-leading Thunder racked up another win, seeing off the Toronto Raptors 116-107.\n\nAnd the Boston Celtics consolidated their grip on second spot in the East with a 97-81 win over the Phoenix Suns.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are inching closer to keeping one of their leaders at the club beyond the current season.\n\nCasemiro’s expected departure will come as a big blow, both on and off the pitch, considering the experience and winning mentality he brought to the squad.\n\nTom Heaton, another of the leaders in the group, could also be let go. To make matters worse, the contract of Harry Maguire was also up in the summer, with INEOS dilly-dallying over an extension.\n\nNaturally, plenty of clubs were eyeing the soon-to-be free agent, with a few even attempting an audacious January raid.\n\nMichael Carrick held firm, and blocked all exits, but with the co-owners yet to agree a new deal, it seemed like the former club captain would be on his way out.\n\nBut according to Teamtalk, there has been a breakthrough in talks between the club and the defender.\n\nINEOS wanted the Englishman to take a pay cut, and as things stand, that is likely to happen. Also, the new deal will be a short-term one, likely to be for a year, which suits INEOS.\n\n“Sources have highlighted positive developments in talks between Maguire and Man Utd.\n\n“Sources close to the situation, describe “positive signs” that a compromise could be reached, likely involving a wage reduction from his current £180,000 per week and a short-term extension of perhaps one additional season.\n\n“They are the ideal terms for United, given we’ve all seen how quickly players deep into their thirties can decline.\n\n“With Casemiro set to depart, Maguire’s experience and recent solid performances have bolstered his case to remain, earning support from the dressing room and interim manager Michael Carrick.”\n\nHarry Maguire has been in top form for the caretaker head coach, and his teammates all want him to stay. So this will please both Carrick and the players.\n\nFeature image Shaun Botterill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

It officially begins on March 11, with the legal negotiating period beginning on March 9.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have many roster decisions to make before then.\n\nLeading up to the new league year, we will profile every player on the roster, go over what they did last season, what their contract status is and what they face in 2026.\n\nNext up is wide receiver Zay Jones.\n\nJones was re-signed in 2025 for a second season with the team. After a disappointing eight-catch season in 2024, the 2025 season was also disappointing. He had only 12 catches for 183 yards in eight games, and then tore his Achilles against the Seattle Seahawks and missed the rest of the season.\n\nJones is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent when the new league year begins on March 11.\n\nThis is going to be a tough offeason for Jones. He will have to get healthy first, but after a total of 20 catches over two seasons, teams will not be banging down the door for his services.\n\nHe likely will land a league-minimum deal around training camp. As for the Cardinals, don't expect him back.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Morocco are weighing up a sensational move to hire Xavi Hernandez as doubts intensify over the future of head coach Walid Regragui just months before the 2026 World Cup, per The Athletic.\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) has publicly denied that Regragui has left his post, but senior figures have sounded out potential replacements.\n\nFormer Barcelona midfielder and head coach Xavi is among the names being discussed.\n\nNo agreement has been reached, and sources close to the Spanish tactician suggest he would prefer to take on a new role after this summer’s tournament rather than immediately.\n\nRegragui made history by guiding Morocco to the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the furthest any African nation has progressed in the competition.\n\nThat remarkable run increased expectations at home, fuelled by significant investment in facilities and infrastructure over the past decade.\n\nHowever, subsequent tournaments have failed to match that high.\n\nMorocco exited at the last-16 stage of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations and then fell agonisingly short in last month’s 2025 final, losing in extra time to Senegal on home soil.\n\nCriticism of Regragui’s pragmatic style has grown louder, with pressure mounting despite his previous achievements.\n\nMorocco have been drawn alongside Brazil, Scotland and Haiti at the expanded 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and the FRMF could make a coaching change before the tournament begins.\n\nXavi would be a bold appointment. The 46-year-old impressed during his stint as Barcelona head coach, winning the league and Spanish Super Cup while blooding many young players.\n\nA World Cup winner with Spain in 2010, he enjoyed a glittering career at Barcelona, lifting four Champions League titles and eight La Liga crowns.\n\nHe moved into coaching with Al-Sadd and later returned to manage Barcelona between 2021 and 2024.",

    "description": "The Lakers come up short when LeBron James misses a last-second shot that sends L.A. to a 110-109 loss to the Magic.",
    "fullText": "In a topsy-turvy fourth quarter, the Lakers came up short when LeBron James missed a last-second shot that sent them to a 110-109 loss to the Orlando Magic on Tuesday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nLuka Doncic had 22 points to lead the Lakers but was just eight for 24 from the field and two for 10 from three-point range. He was wide open behind the arc after taking the inbounds pass in the closing seconds, but he didn't shoot, passing to James with the clock running down.\n\nJames took a turnaround three that missed. He finished with 21 points, six rebounds and four assists.\n\nThe lead went back and forth most of the fourth quarter, each play more important than the previous one, each moment more intense, each possession more meaningful.\n\nWhen Rui Hachimura drilled a three-pointer from the corner off a pass from Doncic for a 106-103 lead with 2 minutes 14 seconds left, the Lakers (34-23) looked to be in pretty good shape.\n\nBut Magic star Paolo Banchero scored in the paint, giving him a game-high 36 points, and was fouled by Deandre Ayton. Banchero missed the free throw, leaving the Lakers ahead 106-105 with 1:18 left.\n\nJames went to work in the post over the smaller Anthony Black, drawing a foul. But James made just one of two free throws for a 107-105 lead\n\nMagic guard Desmond Bane (22 points) answered with a three-pointer for a 108-107 lead that forced the Lakers to call a timeout with 34.6 seconds left.\n\nHachimura missed a three but the Lakers retained possession, and on the ensuing inbounds play Doncic found James cutting down the lane for a dunk for a 109-108 Lakers lead.\n\nBanchero missed a jumper, but Wendell Carter Jr. grabbed the rebound and scored for a 110-109 Orlando lead with 6.7 seconds left. The Magic finished with 12 offensive rebounds.\n\nThe Lakers called another timeout and had one last opportunity, but this time they couldn’t get a good shot and time expired.\n\nThe good news was the Lakers sawa more engaged Ayton, a more active big man, a more involved player.\n\nDoncic passed the ball inside to Ayton in the midpost early in the third quarter and watched his big center turn and shot over a smaller defender. Ayton missed the shot, but he collected the rebound and scored on a layup.\n\nAyton had 17 points on six-for-eight shooting and six rebounds in the first half and 21 points for the game to go along with 13 rebounds.\n\nDoncic went down late in the first quarter after getting poked in his eye by Mo Wager, a red mark developing beneath his eye. Doncic stayed down for a while before eventually getting up with one minute and 59 seconds left in the first.\n\nOn the very next possession, Doncic drilled a three-pointer, a sign that his vision was clear.\n\nHe finished the first quarter with 11 points on four-for-eight shooting, four rebounds and four assists.\n\nAfter the end of the first, Doncic went to the Lakers’ locker room, but he returned to the bench early in the second quarter.\n\nEarly in that second quarter, the Lakers displayed hustle and defense.\n\nJames ran down Anthony Black and blocked his shot off the backboard. Banchero got the rebound, but he had his shot blocked by a hustling Marcus Smart.\n\nThe Lakers started the third quarter by giving their fans a highlight moment.\n\nIt began with Ayton getting the defensive rebound and passing the ball to James, who then whipped the ball to Austin Reaves and filled the lane on the fast break.\n\nReaves threw a lob to James for a dunk, bringing the crowd to its feet.\n\nThe Lakers even opened a 12-point lead in the third quarter, their defense on point and their offense looking good.\n\nBut the Magic didn’t stop coming after the Lakers.\n\nOrlando closed out the third quarter hard and got to within 80-79 entering the fourth.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Canadian soccer federation doesn’t know if FC Bayern’s Alphonso Davies will play for them in March yet or not…",
    "fullText": "It’s been one step forward and two steps backward for Bayern Munich’s Alphonso Davies. He sustained a muscle fiber tear in his right hamstring during Bayern’s recent 3-2 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga and was forced to come off in the 50th minute to be replaced by Hiroki Ito. He’s now set for a considerable spell on the sidelines for the German Rekordmeister and a combination of Ito, Konrad Laimer, Josip Stanišić, Tom Bischof, and Raphaël Guerreiro will have to fill in at left back for Vincent Kompany.\n\nThe injury blow for the Canadian international unfortunately comes just over two months after he had made his return to action from his cruciate ligament injury that he had suffered last March whilst on international duty with the Canadian national team for the CONCACAF Nations League. At the time, Davies’ injury was the subject of controversy because he had injured his knee in the semifinals match against Mexico and should not have played in the third place, dead rubber match against the United States that ultimately lead to the cruciate ligament tear and its severity.\n\nAhead of Canada’s upcoming March friendlies against the likes of Iceland and Uzbekistan, the Canadian Soccer Federation released a statement saying they’re currently unsure whether or not Davies will take part in the pair of matches. They also express that they’re in contact with Bayern reharding the matter.\n\nThe statement (via @iMiaSanMia):\n\nOur Men’s National Team’s medical staff continues to be in close communication with FC Bayern München’s medical staff concerning Alphonso Davies. A determination on his availability for the upcoming March international window has not yet been made. In the coming weeks, we will announce the full team roster.\n\nIt’s all in perspective. For the Canadian national team and Davies, pride is always at play and he’ll want to play every match he can for his country, rightfully so. For Bayern, they’d be watching with nervous eyes if Davies plays a part in the friendlies at such a crucial stage of the season for the Bundesliga champions and losing him again to another long-term injury could prove to be costly.",

    "fullText": "BYU quickly goes from scoring an upset to suffering one.\n\nAfter notching what seemed to be a rejuvenating win over No. 6 Iowa State this past weekend, the Cougars fell 97-84 Tuesday night to unranked UCF in the most disappointing performance of the Kevin Young era.\n\nThe Cougars are now 20-8 on the season and 8-7 in Big 12 play.\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) February 25, 2026\n\nUCF dominated from start to finish. BYU never led at any point on Tuesday, falling into a 10-point hole after less than four minutes and going into halftime trailing by 24.\n\nAny sliver of hope for dramatic late comeback vanished once UCF opened the second half on a 12-0 run.\n\nThe Cougars may have only lost by 13 points, but it felt much more like 30 — a margin by which they trailed for the majority of the second half before UCF took its foot off the gas.\n\nWith the loss, BYU broke a 16-game win streak against unranked opponents at home.\n\nBut more concerningly, such a setback could cause a significant slide for the Cougars’ NCAA tournament seeding a few weeks from now.\n\nBYU couldn’t stop UCF. When the Cougars fell 99-92 at Oklahoma State earlier this month, it felt as if their defense had hit rock bottom.\n\nHowever, giving up 97 points at home to UCF is clearly much more alarming, especially considering the Knights were playing without their leading scorer Riley Kugel, who missed the game with an injury.\n\nUCF made five of its first six 3-pointers and never slowed down, having a separate stretch of nine of 12 makes and finishing the night shooting 58% from behind the arc.\n\nIn all, the Knights shot 56% from the field, scored 44 paint points, 19 points in transition and averaged 1.31 points per possession.\n\nA stronger second half couldn’t salvage BYU’s poor offensive showing. The Cougars did score 56 points after halftime, but considering their second half scoring didn’t begin until being down by 36 points, it’s safe to say the whole period was essentially just garbage time.\n\nIn all, BYU shot 41% from the field and 33% from 3-point range. In the first half, those marks were 31% and 27%, respectively, for a meager 28 points.",

    "description": "Utes commit season-high 18 turnovers as Cyclones bounce back from loss to thump Utah.",
    "fullText": "No. 4 Iowa State looked like a team that was ready for a bounce back when the Cyclones met up with Utah on Tuesday night at the Huntsman Center.\n\nThe Cyclones were coming off a 79-69 loss at BYU three days before, just their fourth loss of the season.\n\nSeven minutes into the matchup with the Runnin’ Utes, though, Iowa State seized control and never let go.\n\nUtah led 12-10 early, but the Cyclones used a 12-0 run to build a double-digit lead for the first time, and from there, Iowa State’s pressure defense was simply too much for the Utes to realistically hope that they could keep pace.\n\nUtah ended up turning the ball over a season-high 18 times against the Cyclones, who converted those takeaways into 20 points.\n\n“The pressure, it’s hard to replicate that pressure in practice. We let our guys know it was coming, but it’s hard to stay in a game with a team like that when you turn the ball over, especially that many times in the first half, I think it was 11,” Utah coach Alex Jensen said.\n\n“But (there’s) a lot of things to learn for us, again. We made some good plays, but then we struggled to keep replicating that. All the credit to Iowa State, a good team.”\n\nIowa State also had the edge in points in the paint (38-26) and bench scoring (26-8), two signs of the Cyclones’ superior physicality and depth.\n\nEventually, the Utes wore down.\n\n“Across the board, our guys took a lot of pride in guarding the basketball and making sure that we continue to be disruptive throughout the course of the game,” Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “For us, that’s when we’re at our best, and our guys did a great job with that.”\n\nUtah still made it interesting for a minute in the second half after trailing 41-31 at halftime.\n\nOver the first 3:09 of the second half, Utah went on a 9-4 run, trimming that deficit in half.\n\nThe final field goal in that stretch was particularly impressive — just 20 seconds after Don McHenry scored to make it 45-38, Keanu Dawes came up with a steal, then the Utes moved the ball quickly around before it went back to Dawes, whose slam made it 45-40.\n\nThat brought the Huntsman Center crowd to life.\n\nUnfortunately, the Cyclones had an answer.\n\nIowa State clamped down defensively again, and Utah — who shot just 38.1% in the second half — only scored four points over the next six and a half minutes as the Cyclones (24-4, 11-4 Big 12) pushed their way to a game-high 17-point lead at 61-44.\n\nThat stretch squelched any hopes that Utah (10-18, 2-13 Big 12) could pull the upset.\n\nForward Joshua Jefferson, an All-Big 12 second-teamer a year ago, paced Iowa State in the second half. He had 13 of his 21 points after the break and also had six rebounds, three assists and two steals.\n\n“It felt pretty good,” Jefferson said, when asked about his ability to bring the fight in a physical game. “You know, (I’ve) been dealing with physicality all season, so I expect it at this point. People are just going to try to muscle me up, but it’s just on me to outmaneuver them every single time I can.”\n\nMilan Momlicovic hit three of his four 3-pointers in the second half and had 14 points for Iowa State, who shot 47.5% for the game.\n\nJamarion Batemon (13 points) and Blake Buchanan (10) also scored in double-figures for the Cyclones.\n\nEarly on, it looked like Utah might make a game out of it. The Utes made five of their first nine field goals, on a night where Utah shot 45.7%, including a four-point play from McHenry on the Utes’ opening possession.\n\nOnce Utah got out to that 12-10 lead, though, the Cyclones’ swarming defense got Utah to speed up, and Iowa State used a 18-5 run to go up 28-17.\n\n“I think everybody saw it, the full-court pressure,” Jensen said of Iowa State’s suffocating defense. “Again, hard to replicate it. … I think it just got us sped up and out of our game plan a little bit, and then, you know, (it) gets discouraging when it’s hard to pass the ball.”\n\nThe Utes got the crowd back into the contest with an 8-0 spurt, headlined by back-to-back 3-pointers from Seydou Traore and Terrence Brown, to cut the Iowa State lead to 29-27.\n\nIowa State, though, again had a response, going on a 6-0 run over the next minute, including a fastbreak layup off a steal, to push its lead back out to 35-27.\n\nThe Cyclones took a 41-31 lead into halftime, after forcing 11 first-half turnovers from Utah and converting those into 14 points.\n\nUtah’s guards led the way for the home team, as Brown, McHenry and Obomate Abbey combined to score Utah’s first 21 points and 24 of their 31 in the first half.\n\nBrown scored 18 points and shot 6 of 10 from the field and 6 of 8 from the free-throw line. He added four rebounds and three assists, but Brown also had a seven-worst seven turnovers.\n\nMcHenry put up 14 points and added two assists and a steal.\n\nDawes, meanwhile, had his fifth double-double in the past eight games, finishing with 10 points and 12 rebounds. He also had two assists and a steal.\n\nFor the Utes, there was plenty to learn from the loss — including how they can attack the pressure that teams like Iowa State will throw at them.\n\n“You got to use the aggressiveness against them, get a lot of back door cuts,” Dawes said. “And I think we got them a little, especially in the second half. We just got to do that more and figure out what works more earlier on in the game.”\n\nUtah will be on the road for two of its final three games of the regular season.\n\nThat starts with a trip to Arizona State on Saturday (1:30 p.m. MST, TNT).\n\nAfter Utah faced another physical team in Iowa State — its the fifth top 5 Big 12 defense the Utes have had to deal with the past three weeks, along with Houston, Kansas, West Virginia and Cincinnati — Jensen simply tipped his cap to the effort from Iowa State.\n\n“Give a lot of credit to T.J. and Iowa State, it’s a good team, well assembled. They play hard, their guys play their roles. They sustain effort, and they get better as the game goes on,” he said.",

In the second half, he pulled off an impressive flying save to deny the home side a second after a wonderful scissor kick attempt.\n\nHe also denied Blackburn late on when an effort was slid in from a cross, but Vitek stood tall to repel the effort. The Manchester United academy player was not finished yet, though, as he saved from close range after a fine mazy run from the Blackburn attacker.\n\nHe made a total of six saves, with five of them coming from shots inside the area.\n\nVitek also made two high claims and two clearances in the game. He also came out on top in his only aerial duel of the match.\n\nBristol City will be back in action on Friday evening at home to Watford.\n\nWheatley was substituted on in the 24th minute but then left the pitch again after 74 minutes in Bradford City’s 1-0 win over Rotherham United.\n\nHe had one shot that was blocked and failed in both his dribble attempts.\n\nWheatley did well in his passing, though, making two key passes and completing 72% of his overall attempts.\n\nHe also won a total of five duels in the match as he put himself about well with the Rotherham defence.\n\nBradford will next be in action away to Reading on Saturday afternoon.\n\nFeature image Ed Sykes via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Liverpool could hit two birds with one stone if they are to sign the latest name being linked with the club.\n\nAccording to the father of Roland Sallai, Szoboszlai's international teammate, Liverpool have already made contact to sign the Galatasaray winger.\n\n\"Liverpool could be such a destination, and I admit, I wouldn't be surprised if this club change happened now, in the winter,\" Tibor Sallai told Blikk.\n\n\"I know that contact has already been made through a management office. I don't want to and I don't want to shout anything, but my son will really have a good chance in the summer, if there is an offer that is also beneficial for Galatasaray, to change country and level. It wouldn't be just any moment if Liverpool were to run out onto the Anfield Road turf with three Hungarians in the starting lineup.\"\n\nSallai's father is referencing the fact that Liverpool already have Milos Kerkez and Szoboszlai playing for them.\n\nHere's why this could be a really good move for Liverpool. While Sallai is a little bit on the more experienced side he is an extremely versatile player.\n\nPredominantly, he is a winger. He has been playing that position ever since he started his career in senior football.\n\nBut this season Sallai has also become a right-back at Galatasaray. He's played really well in that position, impressing against Juventus and Manchester City in the Champions League, while coming up against some really tricky wingers.\n\nSo, there should be no surprise that he would be on Liverpool's radar. Sallai is the type of player Liverpools' recruitment team have loved over the last few years.\n\nHe can solve a problem at right-back, he can provide depth on the wings, and on top of that he's even played through the middle for Hungary's national team, so he could potentially be used as a false nine, too.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United claimed a 3-2 win (9-3 on aggregate) over Qarabag at St James’ Park to send the Azerbaijani champions packing out of the UEFA Champions League.\n\nSandro Tonali, Joelinton, and Sven Botman scored as Newcastle advanced comfortably on aggregate and into the last 16 of the tournament for the first time.\n\nThe Geordies had done most of the work in the first leg and took the opportunity to rest a few key players and blood some new ones.\n\nWith the Premier League run-in looming, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe unsurprisingly rested first-choice left-back Lewis Hall, starting Alex Murphy in his place.\n\nThe 21-year-old has featured on the bench in several Newcastle games this season but eventually received the chance to prove his mettle. He grabbed it with both hands.\n\nMurphy won 3/4 ground and 2/3 aerial duels. He made two interceptions and two clearances. He made five recoveries and seven defensive contributions.\n\nOn the offensive side, he made 13 carries and played one key pass. Tonali was the star of the show, but Murphy was just as good.\n\nNewcastle writer Lee Ryder gave Murphy an 8/10 rating, saying (via Chronicle Live), “Has waited patiently for his chance and did well. Stuck to his task and did not shirk a tackle.”\n\nHall has struggled with some injury setbacks this term, but Murphy has shown that he can deputise for the England international.\n\nNewcastle’s coming games are ridiculously difficult, and it is hard to envisage Murphy getting another chance to strut his stuff anytime soon.\n\nThe FA Cup would have been perfect for a run-out, but with Manchester City coming to St James’ Park, Howe might opt for the more experienced Hall.\n\nThe Annaghdown native joined Newcastle from Galway United in May 2022 and will hope to establish himself behind Hall before playing a more prominent role next season.\n\nNewcastle take on Chelsea or Barcelona in the Champions League round of 16.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are understood to be tracking Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson as the Blues look to bolster their engine room, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nLauded by former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and as an elite player, he is attracting keen interest in the market.\n\nChelsea could use a midfielder who can seamlessly transition between defensive midfield and central midfield roles.\n\nNew manager Liam Rosenior is using a three-man midfield of Andrey Santos, Moises Caicedo, and Enzo Fernandez, but outside those options, he needs a deeper squad.\n\nRomeo Lavia has been persistently injured, and Dario Essugo has also endured a season filled with setbacks.\n\nThe Blues need another midfielder to bolster the roster, and Anderson fits the bill.\n\nHowever, Chelsea are not alone in the race for his signature, with Newcastle United, Manchester United and Manchester City also pursuing a deal for the 23-year-old.\n\nForest are also poised to demand upwards of £80 million for his signature, making any deal difficult to complete.\n\nIf Chelsea are serious about mounting a genuine Premier League title challenge next season, Anderson is exactly the calibre of signing they must prioritise.\n\nThe England international is no raw project or speculative punt.\n\nAnderson is already a hardened top-flight performer who understands the tempo, intensity, and tactical demands of English football.\n\nHe would not need two seasons of adaptation or careful shielding. He would arrive ready to contribute immediately.\n\nToo often in recent windows, Chelsea have leaned toward youthful potential over proven pedigree.\n\nThat strategy has its merits, but title races are not won on promise alone. They are won with depth, reliability, and players who can deliver from day one.\n\nIf the Blues bypass Anderson in favour of another long-term project to plug the gap, it would signal that they are not truly ready to compete for the crown.",

    "description": "JP Morgan Chase chief warns that rising asset prices with people leveraging to the hilt is reminiscent of the 2008 global financial crisis",
    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, has warned that some lenders are doing “dumb things” and he is starting to see parallels to the era before the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nDimon, 69, who steered America’s biggest bank through the global financial crisis, told investors: “Unfortunately, we did see this in ’05, ’06 and ’07, almost the same thing — the rising tide was lifting all boats, everyone was making a lot of money, people were leveraging to the hilt.\n\n“My own view is people getting a little comfortable that this is real, these high asset prices and high volumes, and we won’t have any kind of problem, whatsoever.”\n\n• How a doomsday AI blog post wiped out billions\n\nReferring to unspecified competitors, he added: “I see a couple people doing some dumb things. They’re just doing dumb things to create [net interest income], or say they’re winning in the mortgage business.”\n\nHe also said he expects the credit cycle will eventually deteriorate again, potentially as a result of AI related disruption to software companies.\n\n“There’s always a surprise in a credit cycle … And this time around, it might be software, because of AI … There’s moving tectonic plates underneath it, it causes the industry to be challenged.”\n\nDimon warned in October about weakness in the credit market after the collapses of auto lender Tricolor Holdings and car-parts supplier First Brands Group. He told investors at the time: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more, and so everyone should be forewarned of this one.”\n\nDimon’s latest warning came as a Bank of America client survey found that, for the first time, an “AI bubble” is the biggest concern of credit investors, who noted the high levels of borrowing of cloud service providers, known as “hyperscalers”, including Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Google.\n\nInvestors expect hyperscaler debt issuance of $285 billion this year, up from the $210 billion expected in December’s survey. Some 23 per cent of respondents saw the threat of an AI bubble as their top concern, up from 9 per cent in Bank of America’s previous survey in December.\n\nFears of a potentially unsustainable surge in investment and valuations of AI companies overtook “bubbles in credit” as the top concern, according to the survey.\n\nMeanwhile, “few worry about geopolitics or a central bank policy error”, the bank’s analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, investors were less worried about the ultimate tech disruption ahead, with only 10 per cent saying that AI-driven corporate obsolescence is their big worry.",

    "description": "An interactive journey through number system construction. Start with nothing and build natural numbers, integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers, one crisis at a time.",
    "fullText": "I don't mean \"what does the symbol 3 look like\" or \"how do you count to ten.\" Where does the number three actually live? You can hold three apples, but you can't hold threeness. You can write the digit 3, but that's ink on paper. So what is it?\n\nYou can swap apples for stars or boxes, but the count stays the same. \"Three\" is whatever all groups-of-three have in common. But that's circular. What is the thing they have in common?\n\nThere are so many numbers: 1, 3/7, pi, 3.12. Where did these come from? Mathematics is people making up a rule and following it to see what happens.\n\nWe'll do that here. We start with nothing: no numbers, no arithmetic, no assumptions. By the end we'll have built the natural numbers, the integers, the rationals, the reals, and the complex numbers.\n\nWe need a starting point. Say there is one thing, a starting object we'll call zero. Not zero the quantity you already know, but just a name for where we begin.\n\nNow one rule. Given any object, you can produce the next one. Write this as a function SS, where S(n)S(n) means \"the successor of nn.\" S(0)S(0) is the first object we generate, S(S(0))S(S(0)) is the second, and so on. There's no addition and no multiplication yet. All you can do is say \"give me the next one.\"\n\nThat's all counting is. Keep applying the one rule. You don't need to know what 7 \"means\" to get there. Apply SS seven times and you land on the seventh object.\n\nThis chain never stops. There's no largest natural number, because every number has a successor. Mathematicians call this infinite: the process of taking successors has no end. We write this unbounded behavior with symbols like ∞\\infty in limits and extended settings. But ∞\\infty itself is not a natural number. A finite value is any specific natural number you can reach by stopping at some point, like 7, 400, or a trillion. When we say something \"goes to infinity,\" we mean it keeps increasing past every finite value, never arriving anywhere.\n\nYou can always go forward, but you can't go back. There's no predecessor of zero, and there's no shortcut. To reach 5 you have to pass through 1, 2, 3, and 4 first.\n\nBut how do we know this chain is all there is? Our rules say \"there's a starting point\" and \"every object has a successor.\" Nothing prevents a rogue cluster of objects (say A, B, C) forming their own loop, each one the successor of the previous, disconnected from zero. The successor rule would still be satisfied. We need something extra.\n\nInduction. Picture a chain of dominoes. Show that domino 0 falls (the base case). Then show that whenever domino nn falls, it knocks over domino S(n)S(n) (the inductive step). If both hold, every domino in the chain falls, and no domino outside the chain can claim to be part of the system.\n\nOnce domino 0 falls, and each domino tips the next, the whole chain goes down. In the strongest version of this idea, the natural numbers are exactly the things you can reach from 0 by repeating successor. A rogue cluster disconnected from zero? This rule excludes it, because the chain from 0 never reaches it. (Logic side note: in some weaker rule systems, mathematicians can build versions with extra \"numbers\" beyond this chain.)\n\nMathematicians call this the natural numbers, written N\\mathbb{N}. A standard axiom list (axioms are just starting rules) for this is called the Peano axioms. The core ingredients are a starting point (zero), a rule (successor), and induction (nothing else sneaks in), plus two guardrails: 0 is not anyone's successor, and different numbers have different successors.\n\nCounting is fine, but we need arithmetic. Addition comes from SS and two rules:\n\na+S(b)=S(a+b)a + S(b) = S(a + b)\n\nAdding zero changes nothing. Adding the successor of bb is the same as taking the successor of a+ba + b. It's recursive, meaning the rule calls itself on a smaller input until bb hits 0.\n\nTo compute 2+32 + 3, the rules unwind: 2+S(2)=S(2+2)2 + S(2) = S(2 + 2), then 2+S(1)=S(2+1)2 + S(1) = S(2 + 1), then 2+S(0)=S(2+0)=S(2)2 + S(0) = S(2 + 0) = S(2). Each step peels off one SS from bb and wraps one SS around the result, until the base case a+0=aa + 0 = a stops the recursion.\n\nMultiplication follows the same recursive pattern, defined in terms of addition:\n\na×S(b)=a+(a×b)a \\times S(b) = a + (a \\times b)\n\nMultiplying by zero gives zero. Multiplying by the successor of bb means computing a×ba \\times b and adding one more aa. Recursive again, where each layer adds one copy of aa. So 3×S(S(S(0)))3 \\times S(S(S(0))) unwinds to 3+(3+(3+0))3 + (3 + (3 + 0)).\n\nEvery operation reduces to repeated applications of simpler ones. Multiplication is repeated addition, and addition is repeated successor. The whole thing rests on the successor function.\n\nAdding any two natural numbers always produces another natural number. Multiplying them does too. This property is called closure, meaning the naturals are closed under addition and multiplication. Every operation stays inside the system, and the next operation we try won't.\n\nThe natural numbers feel complete. Add or multiply any two of them and you always get another natural number.\n\nBut addition raises a question. If a+b=ca + b = c, can you recover bb from aa and cc? \"I had some apples, you gave me 3, now I have 8. How many did I start with?\" That's subtraction.\n\n5 minus 3 is 2, that works. 7 minus 7 is 0, still works. Try 3 minus 5.\n\nIn the natural numbers, 3 minus 5 has no answer. You can't go below zero, so the operation just fails. Subtraction breaks closure. You can set up a subtraction with two natural numbers, but the result might not be one.\n\nSubtraction produces results our system can't represent. We could ban it when it fails, or expand the system so it always works.\n\nHow do you represent \"below zero\" when all you have are natural numbers? Represent every integer as a pair (a,b)(a, b), where the pair means \"aa minus bb.\"\n\nSo (5,2)(5, 2) means 3. But (6,3)(6, 3) also means 3, and so does (7,4)(7, 4), and (100,97)(100, 97). All these pairs represent the same integer.\n\nThis is an equivalence class, a collection of representations that all behave identically. The integer 3 is the whole collection of pairs whose difference is 3.\n\nDefining integers as pairs is only useful if we can do arithmetic with them. Adding two pairs: (a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d). Combine the positives and the negatives separately. If different pairs representing the same integer produce the same answer, the definition is consistent.\n\nThis consistency isn't obvious. Different pairs represent the same integer, so arithmetic has to give the same result no matter which representative you pick. It does. Mathematicians call this well-definedness: the answer doesn't depend on which equivalent form you started with.\n\nThis gives us the integers, Z\\mathbb{Z}. Every natural number is still here (write it as (n,0)(n, 0)), but now we also have negative numbers. Subtraction demanded they exist.\n\nThe number line extends left of zero, and the operations that broke before work.\n\n3 minus 5 kicked us out of ℕ, but in ℤ it's just −2, a point on the number line two steps left of zero. Every subtraction lands somewhere.\n\nNow that we have negative numbers, what happens when we multiply them? Negative times negative being positive isn't a convention. It follows from rules we already have. Multiplication distributes over addition: a×(b+c)=a×b+a×ca \\times (b + c) = a \\times b + a \\times c. This is the distributive law. Since multiplication is repeated addition, a×(b+c)a \\times (b + c) means \"jump by aa a total of b+cb + c times.\" Do all those jumps at once, or bb first then cc more, and you end up at the same spot either way:\n\nTry applying it. (−1)×(1+(−1))=(−1)×0=0(-1) \\times (1 + (-1)) = (-1) \\times 0 = 0. Distributing the left side gives (−1)×1+(−1)×(−1)=0(-1) \\times 1 + (-1) \\times (-1) = 0, which simplifies to −1+(−1)(−1)=0-1 + (-1)(-1) = 0, forcing (−1)(−1)=1(-1)(-1) = 1. The distributive law leaves no room for a negative result.\n\nThe integers handle subtraction. Subtract any two integers and you stay inside Z\\mathbb{Z}. Closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication. But try dividing.\n\n6 divided by 3 is 2, that works. 10 divided by 2 is 5, still works. What about 1 divided by 3?\n\nThere's no integer equal to one-third. Division breaks closure the same way subtraction broke the naturals.\n\nSame fix as before: pairs. This time (a,b)(a, b) means \"aa divided by bb.\" The top number aa is the numerator, the bottom bb is the denominator. These are the rational numbers.\n\nLike integers, different pairs can represent the same value. (1,2)(1, 2) and (2,4)(2, 4) and (3,6)(3, 6) are all the same rational number.\n\nThe numerator and denominator grow, but the proportion stays constant. Each scaled version is a different pair, same equivalence class. The rational number one-half is the collection of pairs (k,2k)(k, 2k) for every positive integer kk.\n\nArithmetic works like it did for integers. Adding two fractions: (a,b)+(c,d)=(ad+bc,bd)(a, b) + (c, d) = (ad + bc, bd). Cross-multiply the numerators, multiply the denominators.\n\nMultiplying: (a,b)×(c,d)=(ac,bd)(a, b) \\times (c, d) = (ac, bd). Straight across, numerator times numerator, denominator times denominator.\n\nThese are the fraction rules you already know, but we derived them from the pair construction instead of assuming them. And well-definedness holds: different representatives of the same rational give the same results.\n\nTo divide: (a,b)÷(c,d)=(a,b)×(d,c)(a, b) \\div (c, d) = (a, b) \\times (d, c). Flip the second fraction and multiply. Try 7 ÷ 4, the operation that had no integer answer.\n\nThe rationals, Q\\mathbb{Q}, fix division. Add, subtract, multiply, or divide any two rationals (except by zero) and the result is always rational. Closed under all four operations. A system like this is called a field, a number system where these operations behave the usual way.\n\nPick any two rationals, say 1/3 and 1/2. Their average, 5/12, is rational and sits between them. Now pick 1/3 and 5/12. Their average is between those. You can keep going forever and never run out of rationals to wedge in.\n\nMathematicians call this density. Between any two rationals, there's always another one. They seem to fill the number line completely.\n\nEvery crisis so far came from reversing an operation. Subtraction reverses addition, division reverses multiplication. There's one more reversal. You can square a number (3×3=93 \\times 3 = 9), so what number times itself produces a given result? That's the square root. 9=3\\sqrt{9} = 3 because 3×3=93 \\times 3 = 9.\n\nEvery rational number can be written as a decimal. Divide numerator by denominator one digit at a time: take the remainder, bring down a zero (multiply by 10), see how many times the denominator fits. The quotient digit goes after the decimal point, repeat.\n\nWhen the remainder hits zero, the decimal terminates. When a remainder you've already seen comes back, the same digits repeat forever. Try 1/4 (terminates), then 1/3 (repeats).\n\nSome fractions terminate: 1/4=0.251/4 = 0.25, 3/8=0.3753/8 = 0.375. Others repeat forever: 1/3=0.333...1/3 = 0.333..., where the long division produces remainder 1 every step, so digit 3 comes out every step, without end. That trailing \"...\" hides something important. You need infinitely many digits to pin down the value, and no finite string of them lands on it exactly. Fractions and decimals are two notations for the same values.\n\nFor perfect squares this works. 4=2\\sqrt{4} = 2, 9=3\\sqrt{9} = 3, 16=4\\sqrt{16} = 4. But what about 2\\sqrt{2}? What rational number, multiplied by itself, gives exactly 2? Try 1.4: 1.42=1.961.4^2 = 1.96, a little too small. Try 1.5: 1.52=2.251.5^2 = 2.25, too big. So 2\\sqrt{2} is between 1.4 and 1.5. Keep going: 1.412=1.98811.41^2 = 1.9881, 1.422=2.01641.42^2 = 2.0164. Each digit narrows the bracket, and you can zoom in forever. But no fraction will ever land on it exactly. Not because there's an interval with no rationals (there isn't, they're dense), but because this specific limit point is missing from Q\\mathbb{Q}.\n\nNo matter how far you zoom, the square root of 2 sits between rational ticks, never on one. The rationals are dense, meaning between any two of them there's always another one. But they're not complete.\n\nTo see what \"complete\" means, we need two ideas first. A sequence is an ordered list of numbers that never ends. It has a first term, a second term, a third, and keeps going. This is what the \"...\" in 1/3=0.333...1/3 = 0.333... was hiding. The values 0.3, 0.33, 0.333, 0.3333, ... form a sequence of finite decimals that edges closer and closer to 1/31/3 without any single term equaling it. The decimal approximations of 2\\sqrt{2} form a sequence too: 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142, ....\n\nA sequence converges when its terms settle toward a single value. The gap between each term and that target keeps shrinking, and it shrinks past any threshold you name. That target value is called the limit of the sequence. The sequence 1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, ... converges toward 2\\sqrt{2}. By the fifth term the gap is less than 0.001, and by the tenth it's less than 0.0000000001. It never reaches the limit, but it gets arbitrarily close.\n\nNow we can say what completeness means. If the terms of a sequence keep bunching closer and closer together (mathematicians call this a Cauchy sequence), a complete system guarantees the sequence converges to something in the system. The rationals fail this test. You can write a Cauchy sequence of rationals whose terms squeeze tighter and tighter around 2\\sqrt{2}, but there's no rational for it to land on.\n\nTo fill the holes, we construct the real numbers, R\\mathbb{R}. A real number is an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rationals. Just as the integer 3 was the whole collection of pairs with difference 3, the real number 2\\sqrt{2} is the whole collection of rational sequences converging toward it.\n\nEach term below is a fraction. Each one gets closer to 2\\sqrt{2}, but the target itself lives in the gap between all of them.\n\nThat sequence is one representative. But there are infinitely many other rational sequences converging to the same gap. Here are three completely different strategies, each producing a sequence of fractions that closes in on 2\\sqrt{2}:\n\nOne approach is to average guesses. Start with 1. Since 12=11^2 = 1 is too small, 2\\sqrt{2} must be bigger, so 2/1=22/1 = 2 is too big. Average the guess and the correction: (1+2)/2=3/2(1 + 2)/2 = 3/2. Now 3/23/2 is too big ((3/2)2=9/4(3/2)^2 = 9/4), and 2/(3/2)=4/32/(3/2) = 4/3 is too small, so average again: (3/2+4/3)/2=17/12(3/2 + 4/3)/2 = 17/12. Each step squares the error, so the fractions lock onto 2\\sqrt{2} fast.\n\nAnother approach looks for the fraction with the smallest denominator closest to the target. For 2\\sqrt{2}, it produces 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, .... These are the best rational approximations you can get without using bigger denominators, and they alternate between slightly too small and slightly too big.\n\nThe simplest approach is brute force: chop the decimal expansion at each digit. 1, 14/10, 141/100, 1414/1000, .... Each fraction is just the decimal truncation written as a ratio. It converges, but slowly compared to the other two.\n\nAll three strategies generate different sequences of fractions, but they all close in on the same spot. The real number 2\\sqrt{2} is all of them at once, the whole equivalence class.\n\nThe reals complete the number line. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges to a real number. There are no more holes.\n\nThe reals also include other numbers that the rationals miss. Take a circle whose diameter is exactly 1. How long is its circumference, the distance around it? You can measure a straight line by laying a ruler along it. A shape made entirely of straight sides, called a polygon (triangle, square, hexagon, and so on), is almost as easy since you just measure each side and add them up. But a circle has no straight sides. You can't break it into flat pieces and add their lengths.\n\nYou can get close, though. Inscribe a polygon inside the circle so that every corner touches the edge. A triangle (3 sides) gives a rough underestimate. A square (4 sides) is better. A hexagon (6 sides), better still. Each polygon is made of straight segments you can measure exactly, and as you add more sides the polygon hugs the circle more tightly. Its perimeter creeps toward the true circumference. That value is π≈3.14159...\\pi \\approx 3.14159...\n\nNo fraction equals π\\pi exactly. Like 2\\sqrt{2}, it sits in a gap between rationals. Numbers like this are called irrational (not equal to any ratio of whole numbers). It's another equivalence class of Cauchy sequences: 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ....\n\nAnother irrational number shows up when you ask about growth. Suppose you invest €1 at 100% annual interest. Compounded once at year's end, you get €2€2. Compounded twice (50% every six months), you get (1+1/2)2=€2.25(1 + 1/2)^2 = €2.25. Compounded four times (25% each quarter), (1+1/4)4≈€2.44(1 + 1/4)^4 \\approx €2.44. As you compound more and more often, the result keeps growing but never explodes. It settles toward a specific value. Remember, the value a sequence settles toward is its limit, the number the terms keep getting closer to without overshooting. The limit of (1+1/n)n(1 + 1/n)^n as nn grows toward infinity is e≈2.71828...e \\approx 2.71828...\n\nLike π\\pi, no fraction equals ee exactly. Both sit in gaps between rationals, just like 2\\sqrt{2}. The reals fill all of these gaps at once.\n\nThe reals filled every hole on the number line. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots of positive numbers all work.\n\nBut we've only tested square roots on positive numbers. Every previous operation eventually hit an input that broke the system. Does this one?\n\nTry 4=2\\sqrt{4} = 2. Fine. 0=0\\sqrt{0} = 0. Fine. Now try −1\\sqrt{-1}. What number, squared, gives −1-1?\n\nNo real number does. We saw earlier that the distributive law forces negative times negative to be positive, and squaring zero gives zero, so nothing in the reals has a negative square.\n\nSame pattern. A reasonable operation produces a result the system can't hold.\n\nExtend the system using pairs again. A complex number is a pair (a,b)(a, b) of real numbers, written a+bia + bi, where ii is defined by one rule: i×i=−1i \\times i = -1. Calling it \"imaginary\" is a historical accident, no more imaginary than negative numbers were when people first invented them.\n\nWhere does ii live? No real number squares to −1-1, so ii isn't on the number line. It's genuinely new. Since it's not to the left or right of any real number, put it off the line entirely, one unit above zero on a new vertical axis. Every complex number a+bia + bi is a point on this plane: aa tells you how far along the real line, bb how far along the ii axis. 3+2i3 + 2i sits 3 units right and 2 units up. A one-dimensional line became a two-dimensional plane, because the new object didn't fit on the old line.\n\nAll the arithmetic rules from before still apply. The only new fact is i×i=−1i \\times i = -1. Everything else follows.\n\nWatch what multiplying by ii does. Start at 1 on the real axis. 1×i=i1 \\times i = i, one unit up. i×i=−1i \\times i = -1, one unit left. −1×i=−i-1 \\times i = -i, one unit down. −i×i=−(i×i)=1-i \\times i = -(i \\times i) = 1, back where you started. Four multiplications, a full loop.\n\nSplit a full circle into 360 degrees. Four equal steps make 360, so each step is 90 degrees. Multiplying by ii rotates a point 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nTwo multiplications rotate 90+90=18090 + 90 = 180 degrees, from 1 to −1-1. That's i2=−1i^2 = -1, two quarter-turns. The operation that seemed impossible on the number line becomes a rotation in the plane.\n\n3−5=?3 - 5 = ? had no natural number. 1÷31 \\div 3 had no integer. x2=2x^2 = 2 had no rational. x2=−1x^2 = -1 had no real. Each time we expanded the system. But what about x3−2x+5=0x^3 - 2x + 5 = 0? Expressions like these (adding, subtracting, multiplying a variable by constants, raising to whole-number powers) are polynomials. The complex numbers settle all of them. Every non-constant polynomial (non-constant just means \"not a plain number\") with complex coefficients (the numbers in front of each power of xx) has at least one complex root. Equivalently, over C\\mathbb{C}, you can break any such polynomial into linear factors. That doesn't mean every polynomial has a simple radical formula, but it does mean roots exist in C\\mathbb{C}.\n\nEvery number system followed one cycle:\n\nEach system nests inside the next like concentric rings, with the naturals at the center and each expansion adding a ring around the previous ones.\n\nThe cycle repeats across all five systems.\n\nThe naturals couldn't subtract, so we built the integers. The integers couldn't divide, so we built the rationals. The rationals had holes, so we built the reals. The reals couldn't handle all square roots, so we built the complex numbers.\n\nEach system contains all the previous ones: naturals inside integers, inside rationals, inside reals, inside complex numbers. Nothing is lost, and each step adds something new.\n\nDivision by zero never gets fixed while keeping the usual field laws. If a/0=xa / 0 = x and division is still inverse to multiplication, then a=0×x=0a = 0 \\times x = 0 for every aa, collapsing the distinction between all numbers. (There are alternative algebraic systems that assign values to division by zero, but they give up familiar rules.)\n\nThe expansion doesn't stop at C\\mathbb{C} either. Quaternions (four-dimensional) and octonions (eight-dimensional) go further. But each extension costs something. Quaternions give up commutativity (a×b≠b×aa \\times b \\neq b \\times a), octonions give up associativity ((a×b)×c≠a×(b×c)(a \\times b) \\times c \\neq a \\times (b \\times c)). The pattern continues, but the price gets steeper.\n\nEvery number you use today exists because an earlier system couldn't handle some operation, and someone decided to build a new one rather than accept the limitation.",

    "fullText": "The Paris-born artist reinvented the synthesizer through meditative and feedback-drenched sonic explorations\n\nThe French composer and musique concrète pioneer Éliane Radigue has died at the age of 94.\n\n“It is with immense sadness that we learn of the passing of Éliane Radigue at the age of 94,” the Paris-based experimental music center INA GRM posted on Instagram. “A major figure in musical creation has left us.”\n\nBorn in Paris in 1932, Radigue learned piano as a child, but hearing the electroacoustic compositions of musique concrète godfather Pierre Schaeffer on the radio in the early 1950s unlocked something new, setting the course for her own studies in sound. After meeting Schaeffer by chance in the French capital, she worked an assistant for the composer.\n\n“I was just cutting, splicing and editing tape,” she told the Guardian in a 2011 interview. “Of course, at that time the universe of electronic music was totally male, but I was pleased to do anything they asked of me. I was there to learn, and I was learning by doing, like an apprentice. It wasn’t really electronic music I was studying. The studio was against electronic music in favour of ‘concrete’ music: a simple idea of taking real sounds and manipulating them by cutting, splicing, editing, slowing down and so on.”\n\nIn the early 1970s, Radigue was introduced to the synthesizer and the instrument would go on to define the next 30 years of her work. “I just dug under its skin,” she said, and used the ARP 2500 synth to create much of her shape-shifting, meditative music that incorporated feedback and tape hiss. Beyond France, she caught the attention of US composers such as Philip Glass and Steve Reich, who were captivated by her innovative approach to sound.\n\n“What my generation did wasn’t a revolution,” said Reich. “It was a restoration of harmony and rhythm in a whole new way, but it did bring back those essentials that people wanted, that people craved, but in a way they hadn’t heard.”\n\nOn her celebrated Occam Ocean series, Radigue collaborated with solo musicians and ensembles to create drone soundscapes inspired by the vastness of the sea and as an antidote to hectic modern life. “She carved out her own path with unparalleled freedom and vision,” wrote INA GRM. “Our thoughts are with her family, friends and collaborators.”",

    "fullText": "The Citrini Research report titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis” became a major viral sensation this week across social media platforms. The conversation has been dominated by a significant lean toward the findings as 77% of influencers align with the warnings while 23% express disagreement. The report gained massive traction because it presents a detailed scenario in which the success of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a systemic financial collapse. It specifically targets the stability of the global economy and has influenced market prices for several major technology and payment companies as people evaluate the implications of abundant machine intelligence, says GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.\n\nShreyasee Majumder, Social Media Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The overall sentiment among influencers reflects a deep and growing anxiety about the unmodeled risks associated with rapid technological advancement. Most observers view the report as a vital stress test for existing economic assumptions about labor and consumption. Influencers see the current environment as a high stakes game where labs and corporations are forced to automate even if doing so eventually damages the consumer base that supports their revenue.”\n\nBased on an analysis of the tweets, the reaction to Citrini Research’s report is polarized, viral, and highly engaged. Here is a summary of the discussions, divided into opinions of agreement and disagreement:\n\nInfluencers agree with AI displacement spiral\n\nInfluencers disagree with predicted global crisis",

Let me break down what each one means, why they matter, and how to track them all in one place.\n\nYou probably know this one. SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of making your website rank higher in traditional search results. It covers technical stuff like page speed, mobile-friendliness, meta tags, URL structure, and content quality.\n\nSEO is still important. Google isn't going anywhere. But here's the problem: even if you rank #1 for a query, AI assistants might pull the answer from someone else's content and serve it directly to the user. The user never visits your page. Your ranking becomes invisible.\n\nThat's why SEO alone doesn't cut it anymore. You need to think about the full picture.\n\nAEO is a newer concept that focuses on how well your content answers specific questions. Think of it as optimization for featured snippets, knowledge panels, and voice search results, but taken further into the AI era.\n\nWhen someone asks Siri, Alexa, or a chatbot a question, the system looks for content that directly and clearly answers that question. AEO measures how well your site is structured to be that answer.\n\nKey factors that influence your AEO score include structured data (schema markup), clear FAQ sections, concise and direct answers within your content, and proper heading hierarchy that makes it easy for machines to parse your information.\n\nA high AEO score means your content is formatted in a way that answer engines can easily extract and present to users.\n\nAI Visibility is the newest and perhaps most critical metric of the three. It measures how likely your website or brand is to appear in responses generated by AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity.\n\nThis goes beyond traditional crawling and indexing. AI Visibility depends on whether your content is accessible to AI crawlers (like GPTBot or ClaudeBot), whether your robots.txt allows or blocks these bots, whether your content is structured in a way that AI models can learn from, and whether your brand is mentioned across the web in contexts that AI training data would capture.\n\nUnlike SEO, where you can see your rankings directly in Google, AI Visibility has been harder to measure. Until recently, there wasn't a straightforward way to get a score for it.\n\nThink of it this way: SEO gets you found in Google. AEO gets your content selected as the direct answer. AI Visibility gets you mentioned when someone asks an AI assistant about your industry.\n\nA site might score 89 in SEO but only 44 in AI Visibility. That means it ranks well in traditional search but is practically invisible to AI systems. Another site might have great AI Visibility at 93 but lag behind in SEO at 74. That site shows up in AI conversations but struggles in Google results.\n\nThe sweet spot is having all three scores balanced and high.\n\nOne of the tools I've found useful for tracking these metrics is the RepuAI Site Checker. It runs a comprehensive analysis and gives you four scores at a glance: an Overall score plus individual breakdowns for AI Visibility, SEO, and AEO.\n\nWhat I like about this tool is the depth of the analysis. Below the top-level scores, you get a full breakdown across multiple modules: AI Files status, Structured Data, Content Quality, Security, Page Speed, Robots.txt configuration, JS Rendering, URL Structure, and Meta Tags. Each module highlights specific issues and gives you actionable recommendations.\n\nThe report also checks AI Bot Visibility separately, which tells you exactly which AI crawlers can and cannot access your site. This is something most traditional SEO tools completely ignore.\n\nBased on the reports I've seen on the platform, here's a rough benchmark. Scores above 85 across all three metrics put you in solid shape. Anything below 70 in any category means there's real work to do. And if your AI Visibility drops below 60, you're essentially invisible to a growing segment of how people search for information.\n\nFor context, the example in the screenshot above shows an Overall score of 90 with AI Visibility at 93, SEO at 89, and AEO at 85. That's a well-optimized site, though even with those numbers, the report identified 13 issues worth fixing.\n\nNo site is perfect. The goal is continuous improvement.\n\nFor SEO: Focus on page speed, clean URL structures, proper meta tags, and mobile optimization. These are the basics, but so many sites still get them wrong.\n\nFor AEO: Add structured data markup to your pages. Create clear, concise answers to common questions in your niche. Use proper heading tags (H1, H2, H3) to create a logical content hierarchy.\n\nFor AI Visibility: Check your robots.txt file and make sure you're not blocking AI crawlers like GPTBot, ClaudeBot, or PerplexityBot. Create an llms.txt file that helps AI systems understand your site. Make sure your content is accessible without heavy JavaScript rendering.\n\nThe websites that will thrive in the next few years are the ones that optimize for all three dimensions of search: traditional, answer-based, and AI-powered. Ignoring any one of them means leaving traffic and visibility on the table.\n\nIf you haven't checked your scores yet, RepuAI's free site checker is a good starting point. Run the analysis, see where you stand, and start fixing the issues it flags. It takes about 15-30 seconds to get your report.\n\nThe search game has changed. Your optimization strategy should change with it.",

    "fullText": "As I mentioned in Fields Medalists on School Mathematics, school mathematics usually gives a heavily distorted picture of mathematical practice. It's common for bright young people to participate in math competitions, an activity which is closer to that of mathematical practice. Unfortunately, while math competitions may be more representative of mathematical practice than school mathematics, math competitions are themselves greatly misleading. Furthermore, they've become tied to a misleading mythological conception of \"genius.\" I've collected relevant quotations below.\n\nAcknowledgment  - I obtained some of these quotations from a collection of mathematician quotations compiled by my colleague Laurens Gunnarsen.\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Fields Medalist Terence Tao answered the question\n\nWhat advice would you give to young people starting out in math (i.e. high school students and young researchers)?\n\nWell, I guess they should be warned that their impressions of what professional mathematics is may be quite different from the reality. In elementary school I had the vague idea that professional mathematicians spent their time computing digits of pi, for instance, or perhaps devising and then solving Math Olympiad style problems.\n\nIn The Case against the Mathematical Tripos mathematician GH Hardy wrote\n\nIt has often been said that Tripos mathematics was a collection of elaborate futilities, and the accusation is broadly true. My own opinion is that this is the inevitable result, in a mathematical examination, of high standards and traditions. The examiner is not allowed to content himself with testing the competence and the knowledge of the candidates; his instructions are to provide a test of more than that, of initiative, imagination, and even of some sort of originality. And as there is only one test of originality in mathematics, namely the accomplishment of original work, and as it is useless to ask a youth of twenty-two to perform original research under examination conditions, the examination necessarily degenerates into a kind of game, and instruction for it into initiation into a series of stunts and tricks.\n\nIn The Map of My Life mathematician Goro Shimura wrote of his experience teaching at a cram school\n\nI discovered that many of the exam problems were artificial and required some clever tricks. I avoided such types, and chose more straightforward problems, which one could solve with standard techniques and basic knowledge. There is a competition called the Mathematical Olympic, in which a competitor is asked to solve some problems, which are difficult and of the type I avoided. Though such a competition may have its raison d'être, I think those younger people who are seriously interested in mathematics will lose nothing by ignoring it.\n\nIn his lecture at the 2001 International Mathematics Olympiad, Andrew Wiles gave further description of how math competitions are unrepresentative of mathematical practice\n\nLet me then welcome you not only to this event but also to the greater world of mathematics in what many of us believe is now a golden age. However let me also warn you — whatever the route you have taken so far, the real challenges of mathematics are still before you. I hope to give you a glimpse of this. What then distinguishes the mathematics we professional mathematicians do from the mathematical problems you have faced in the last week? The two principal differences I believe are of scale and novelty. First of scale: in a mathematics contest such as the one you have just entered, you are competing against time and against each other. While there have been periods, notably in the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries when mathematicians would engage in timed duels with each other, nowadays this is not the custom. In fact time is very much on your side. However the transition from a sprint to a marathon requires a new kind of stamina and a profoundly different test of character. We admire someone who can win a gold medal in five successive Olympics games not so much for the raw talent as for the strength of will and determination to pursue a goal over such a sustained period of time. Real mathematical theorems will require the same stamina whether you measure the effort in months or in years [...]\n\nThe second principal difference is one of novelty [...] Let me stress that creating new mathematics is a quite different occupation from solving problems in a contest. Why is this? Because you don't know for sure what you are trying to prove or indeed whether it is true.\n\nIn his Mathematical Education essay, Fields Medalist William Thurston said\n\nRelated to precociousness is the popular tendency to think of mathematics as a race or as an athletic competition. There are widespread high school math leagues: teams from regional high schools meet periodically and are given several problems, with an hour or so to solve them.\n\nThere are also state, national and international competitions. These competitions are fun, interesting, and educationally effective for the people who are successful in them. But they also have a downside. The competitions reinforce the notion that either you ‘have good math genes’, or you do not. They put an emphasis on being quick, at the expense of being deep and thoughtful. They emphasize questions which are puzzles with some hidden trick, rather than more realistic problems where a systematic and persistent approach is important. This discourages many people who are not as quick or as practiced, but might be good at working through problems when they have the time to think through them. Some of the best performers on the contests do become good mathematicians, but there are also many top mathematicians who were not so good on contest math.\n\nQuickness is helpful in mathematics, but it is only one of the qualities which is helpful. For people who do not become mathematicians, the skills of contest math are probably even less relevant. These contests are a bit like spelling bees. There is some connection between good spelling and good writing, but the winner of the state spelling bee does not necessarily have the talent to become a good writer, and some fine writers are not good spellers. If there was a popular confusion between good spelling and good writing, many potential writers would be unnecessarily discouraged.\n\nIn his book Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction, Fields Medalist Timothy Gowers writes\n\nWhile the negative portrayal of mathematicians may be damaging, by putting off people who would otherwise enjoy the subject and be good at it, the damage done by the word genius is more insidious and possibly greater. Here is a rough and ready definition of genius: somebody who can do easily, and at a young age, something that almost nobody else can do except after years of practice, if at all. The achievements of geniuses have some sort of magic quality about them - it is as if their brains work not just more efficiently than ours, but in a completely different way. Every year or two a mathematics undergraduate arrives at Cambridge who regularly manages to solve a in a few minutes problems that take most people, including those who are supposed to be teaching them, several hours or more. When faced with such a person, all one can do is stand back and admire.\n\nAnd yet, these extraordinary people are not always the most successful research mathematicians. If you want to solve a problem that other professional mathematicians have tried and failed to solve before you, then, of the many qualities you will need, genius as I have defined it is neither necessary nor sufficient. To illustrate with an extreme example, Andrew Wiles, who (at the age of just over forty) proved Fermat's Last Theorem (which states that if x, y, z, and n are all positive integers and n is greater than 2, then xn + yn cannot equal zn) and thereby solved the world's most famous unsolved mathematics problem, is undoubtedly very clever, but he is not a genius in my sense.\n\nHow, you might ask, could he possibly have done what he did without some sort of mysterious extra brainpower? The answer is that, remarkable though his achievement was, it is not so remarkable as to defy explanation. I do not know precisely what enabled him to succeed, but he would have needed great courage, determination, and patience, a wide knowledge of some very difficult work done by others, the good fortune to be in the right mathematical area at the right time, and an exceptional strategic ability.\n\nThis last quality is, ultimately, more important than freakish mental speed: the most profound contributions to mathematics are often made by tortoises rather than hares. As mathematicians develop, they learn various tricks of the trade, partly from the work of other mathematicians and partly as a result of many hours spent thinking about mathematics. What determines whether they can use their expertise to solve notorious problems is, in large measure, a matter of careful planning: attempting problems that are likely to be fruitful, knowing when to give up a line of thought (a difficult judgement to make), being able to sketch broad outlines of arguments before, just occasionally, managing to fill in the details. This demands a level of maturity which is by no means incompatible with genius but which does not always accompany it.\n\nIn Does one have to be a genius to do maths? Terence Tao concurs with Gowers and expands on the same theme.\n\nFields Medalist Alexander Grothendieck describes his own relevant experience in Récoltes et Semailles\n\nSince then I’ve had the chance in the world of mathematics that bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both among my “elders” and among young people in my general age group who were more brilliant, much more ‘gifted’ than I was. I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradle–while for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things I had to learn (so I was assured) things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects.\n\nIn fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still from the perspective or thirty or thirty five years, I can state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve done all things, often beautiful things in a context that was already set out before them, which they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they would have to rediscover in themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was mine: The capacity to be alone.",

    "fullText": "What is Google RankBrain and how does it affect your brand's visibility? We break down how Google's machine learning algorithm works, its connection to AI search, and the specific steps you can take to optimize — from traditional SEO to visibility in ChatGPT and Perplexity\n\nImagine typing something like \"gray console made by Sony\" into Google. You never wrote the word \"PlayStation.\" But Google knows that's exactly what you're looking for. Ten years ago, the search engine would have been stumped. Today, it figures out queries like this in milliseconds. The technology behind this magic has a name - Google RankBrain.\n\nAnd if you think RankBrain is a relic from the SEO history archives, here's some news: this algorithm is not only alive and well, it has become the foundation for everything Google does with artificial intelligence in search today.\n\nLet's break down how it works, why it matters more than ever, and what all of this means for your brand's visibility - in traditional search and in the new AI-powered engines.\n\nGoogle officially confirmed RankBrain's existence on October 26, 2015. It's a machine learning system built into Google's core algorithm (Hummingbird) that helps process search results and understand what users are actually looking for.\n\nAt launch, RankBrain handled roughly 15% of all search queries — specifically, the ones Google had never seen before. That might not sound like much. But when Google processes billions of queries a day, 15% translates to hundreds of millions of searches the engine previously couldn't handle properly.\n\nToday, RankBrain is involved in virtually every query. Google called it the third most important ranking factor — after content and links. And Google's own experiments showed that RankBrain picks the best result more accurately than human search engineers: 80% accuracy for RankBrain versus 70% for humans.\n\nRankBrain isn't a standalone algorithm that replaces everything else. It's a component inside Hummingbird, like a part within a car engine. And it has two main functions.\n\nBefore RankBrain, Google looked at individual words in a query and tried to find pages with exact matches. RankBrain changed the approach: it converts words into mathematical vectors (numerical representations) and searches for connections between concepts.\n\nA simple example: if someone searches \"what to wear in the rain to a business meeting,\" RankBrain understands the query isn't just about \"rain\" or \"clothes\" — it's about a specific situation. It connects the concepts of \"business attire,\" \"rain protection,\" and \"recommendations\" — and serves relevant results, even if no single page contains that exact phrase.\n\nThis became possible through the shift from \"strings\" to \"entities.\" Google stopped seeing text as a collection of characters and started recognizing real-world objects: people, companies, products, places.\n\nHere's what makes RankBrain truly smart: it watches how people interact with search results. Did the user click a result and stay on the page? Good sign. Did they bounce back after 5 seconds and click another result? That means the first page didn't answer their question.\n\nRankBrain uses these signals to continuously fine-tune rankings. It can dynamically adjust the weight of different factors — backlinks, content freshness, text length, domain authority — depending on the specific query. If users show that a new order of results works better, it stays. If not, the system rolls back the changes.\n\nIn essence, RankBrain is a perpetual A/B test at the scale of billions of queries.\n\nSome SEO professionals consider RankBrain outdated — after all, BERT, MUM, and Gemini came along, and RankBrain was supposedly left behind. This is a misconception.\n\nRankBrain hasn't gone anywhere. It evolved into what experts call the \"reasoning layer\" — the connective tissue between all of Google's AI systems. BERT handles deep natural language understanding. MUM processes multilingual and multimodal queries. Gemini powers generative answers. And RankBrain orchestrates all of it, deciding how much weight to give each signal for a specific query.\n\nThink of it as a conductor of an orchestra: each instrument (BERT, MUM, Gemini) plays its part, but RankBrain decides when and how loud.\n\nNow for the really interesting part. Understanding RankBrain isn't just an academic exercise. It's a direct path to understanding how AI search works as a whole.\n\nRankBrain was the first time machine learning was embedded into Google's core search algorithm. Everything that followed — BERT, AI Overviews, AI Mode — grew from the same logic: understand intent, not keywords.\n\nAnd here's the problem for brands: that same logic now operates in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI platforms. Except the rules there are even stricter.\n\nIn traditional Google, you get a list of 10 links — even if you're in 7th place, you're at least visible. In AI search, there's one answer. If the AI engine doesn't consider your brand authoritative, relevant, and trustworthy enough — you simply don't exist to the user.\n\nAccording to expert estimates, traditional search will lose up to 50% of its share by 2028. AI answers already appear in 57% of Google results. ChatGPT serves 400 million users weekly.\n\nThe good news: the principles that work for RankBrain also work for the new AI engines. Here's what you should be doing right now.\n\nRankBrain analyzes user intent. Stop thinking in terms of \"which keywords to insert\" and start thinking: \"what problem is this person trying to solve?\" Group queries into intent clusters: informational, transactional, navigational.\n\nAI systems (RankBrain included) prioritize content that explores topics in depth. Not 300-word posts written for SEO, but comprehensive guides that fully address the user's question.\n\nSchema markup helps both Google and AI engines understand what your content is about. FAQ schema, organization markup, product and author markup — all of this increases your chances of being cited in AI responses.\n\nRankBrain factors in behavioral signals. Page load speed, mobile usability, Core Web Vitals — all of these affect how users interact with your site, and therefore your rankings.\n\nAI systems aggregate signals from multiple sources: press mentions, reviews, social media, forums. Brands with a strong presence across multiple channels receive more mentions in AI responses. Estimates suggest roughly 250 quality publications are needed to meaningfully influence how an LLM perceives a brand.\n\nFresh content gets priority in both RankBrain and AI engines. If your last blog post is two years old, AI systems will more likely cite a competitor's more up-to-date source.\n\nYou can't improve what you don't measure. Traditional SEO tools don't show how your brand appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini responses. You need specialized solutions for that — and this is exactly the problem RepuAI solves, tracking mentions, sentiment, and visibility of your brand across AI search engines.\n\nRankBrain ushered in an era where machine learning became an integral part of search. But that era isn't standing still. Today, a new discipline is gaining momentum — Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), optimization for generative search engines.\n\nThe logic of GEO is simple: if you used to optimize for an algorithm that ranks links, now you need to optimize for an algorithm that generates answers. And that's an entirely different game.\n\nIn the world of GEO, your brand needs to be:\n\nAnd here the circle closes: the principles RankBrain established — understanding intent, focusing on the user, continuous learning — have become the foundation for all modern AI search systems.\n\nRankBrain was the first — but far from the last — step Google took toward AI-driven search. Understanding its principles gives you a strategic advantage: you see not individual algorithm updates, but the overall direction the industry is heading.\n\nThat direction points one way: from keywords to meaning, from links to authority, from SERP positions to mentions in AI responses.\n\nBrands that understand this now will find themselves in a winning position. The rest will be playing catch-up.\n\nWant to find out how your brand looks through the eyes of AI right now?

    "fullText": "Japan’s OHISAMA demonstration satellite is scheduled to be launched in fiscal 2026 on a mission that could revolutionize clean energy.\n\nAlthough earlier experiments have detected signals transmitted from orbit, the OHISAMA project aims to be the first in the world to deliver solar power to a receiving site on Earth and convert it into usable electricity.\n\nThe satellite will be carried aboard Space One Co.’s Kairos 5 small rocket.\n\nSpace-based solar power (SBSP) refers to the concept of placing large solar collectors in orbit that can convert sunlight into electricity onboard. That energy is transmitted wirelessly, typically by microwave or in some concepts by laser, to a receiving station on Earth.\n\nThe received energy is then converted back into electricity for distribution through the grid.\n\nSBSP remains an experimental technology and is positioned as a long-term research and development target under the Japanese government’s Basic Energy Plan.\n\nUnlike ground-based solar and wind power, SBSP is largely insulated from weather-related variables and the day-night cycle.\n\nIn addition, the ability to modulate transmission output and redirect power to different locations could make SBSP a flexible option during disasters and periods of fluctuating demand.\n\nA model proposed by Japan Space Systems (J-spacesystems), a nonprofit R&D foundation commissioned by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry to develop the system, envisions an architecture featuring 2.5-kilometer-square solar arrays deployed in geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometers above Earth.\n\nElectricity generated in orbit would be transmitted by microwave to a ground-based receiving antenna roughly 4 kilometers in diameter and then fed into the power grid.\n\nUnder this model, a single SBSP unit would generate about 1 gigawatt, an output described as sufficient to cover more than 10 percent of Tokyo’s annual electricity consumption.\n\nMICROWAVES BEAMED FROM 450 KM ABOVE\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, the experiment will test whether power transmitted from space as microwaves can be efficiently converted back into electricity on the ground.\n\nThe OHISAMA satellite, weighing about 180 kg, carries an integrated power-generation and transmission panel measuring 70 cm by 2 meters.\n\nIts generating capacity is a modest 720 watts, but the mission aims to use energy received by a 64-meter parabolic antenna at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Usuda Deep Space Center in Nagano Prefecture to light an LED.\n\nThe Usuda facility is used to track and communicate with deep-space spacecraft.\n\nFollowing a successful wireless power transmission test from an aircraft at an altitude of 7 km in 2024, the satellite mission will beam power from a 450-km orbit to assess how transmission distance, the ionosphere and the atmosphere affect efficiency.\n\nA central challenge in SBSP wireless power delivery is limiting diffraction-driven beam spreading, which typically requires very large transmitting apertures and precise phase control.\n\nMany SBSP concepts rely on retrodirective beam control: the ground-based rectenna sends a pilot signal that the satellite uses to steer the microwave beam back toward the receiver.\n\nJapan has extensive R&D experience in microwave power transmission and retrodirective beam pointing.\n\nAccording to J-spacesystems, SBSP development is accelerating in the United States, China and Europe, and the U.S. military is also widely believed to be pursuing its own experimental satellites.\n\nFirst proposed in the United States in the 1960s, the SBSP concept holds that space-based systems could deliver as much as 10 times more energy per year than terrestrial solar because cloud cover and the day-night cycle constrain generation on Earth.\n\nIn Japan, SBSP research and development has been under way since the 1980s. Through ground-based trials and other tests, Japan has advanced the demonstration and validation of key component technologies, including high-precision beam control, integrated generation-and-transmission panels, and more efficient conversion of electrical power into microwaves.\n\n“Technologically, Japan is leading the world in this field,” said Hiroki Yanagawa, a senior executive in J-spacesystems’ Satellite System and Earth Observation Division.\n\nSBSP COULD POWER LUNAR EXPLORATION\n\nIn 2023, the California Institute of Technology launched an SBSP demonstrator and succeeded in short‑distance power transmission in space as well as in detecting faint microwave signals on the ground. But it did not deliver usable electricity at meaningful levels.\n\nIf electricity beamed from OHISAMA can be received, converted and used on the ground, it would represent a world first.\n\nSuch a success would likely be followed by additional in-orbit trials, with an eye toward commercialization in the 2040s. Potential longer-term applications include supplying power from orbit to support lunar exploration missions.\n\nThe launch schedule, however, remains contingent on the performance of Space One’s Kairos rocket.\n\nAfter failures of the first two launches, attention has shifted to the flight of Kairos 3 on Feb. 25.\n\n“While overseas rockets were an option, we selected Kairos in line with national policy to support Japan’s private-sector launch capabilities,” said Yanagawa of J-spacesystems.",

While the Big Mac is arguably one of the chain’s most iconic and hefty burgers with its two beef patties, American cheese, lettuce, onion, pickles, and Big Mac Sauce sandwiched between three sesame seed buns, their newest creation may give it a run for its money.\n\nIntroducing the Big Arch Burger: two quarter-pound beef patties with three slices of white Cheddar cheese, crispy and slivered onions, lettuce, pickles, and Big Arch Sauce sandwiched between toasted sesame seed buns. While the new burger has had a lot of success in other international markets, it will be making its American debut for the first time on March 3, 2026, but only for a limited time.\n\nThe burger McDonald’s is calling their “most Mcdonald’s, McDonald’s burger yet,” has already garnered global support, and fans on social media can hardly contain their excitement. Some claim it’s even better than the Big Mac.\n\n“Looks better than the Big Mac going to give this a try.”\n\n“I’m definitely gonna devour this.”\n\n“Calling in sick that day so I can get there early. 😂”\n\n“Had this yesterday. Was so good. RIP Big Mac.”\n\n“So much better than the Big Mac.”\n\nWhile we don’t condone skipping work to go try the new burger, if you’re interested in seeing what all the hype is about, just make sure to visit your nearest McDonald’s before it’s gone.

    "fullText": "Under Antarctica's miles-thick ice sheet, scientists have identified 207 possible volcanoes that may be speeding up ice melt and raising global sea levels, according to a recent study published in Earth-Science Reviews.\n\nResearchers created the first continent-wide inventory of these hidden volcanoes, called \"ANT-SGV-25.\" By mapping the volcanoes' size, shape, and location, scientists hope to better understand how heat from beneath the Antarctic ice sheet threatens its stability.\n\nResearchers from several universities compiled data from radar surveys, satellite imagery, and earlier volcanic records to document 207 subglacial volcanic structures. Many are clustered in West Antarctica.\n\nLead author Cui Xiangbin told Xinhua: \"Recent research increasingly shows that subglacial volcanoes hidden beneath the massive ice sheet can alter subglacial topography, promote basal ice melting, regulate subglacial hydrological activity, and ultimately affect ice flow dynamics and the stability of the ice sheet.\"\n\nAs Antarctica's ice melts, global sea levels rise. When volcanoes heat the ice from below, meltwater forms and acts as a lubricant, which allows glaciers to slide faster toward the ocean.\n\nHigher seas threaten coastal homes, roads, and drinking water supplies with flooding and saltwater contamination. According to Yale Environment 360, with 6 feet of sea-level rise, about 1.9 million U.S. homes (worth $882 billion) could be underwater by 2100.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency states that coastal flooding hazards such as storm surge, waves, and erosion \"can cause extensive damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure.\"\n\nPrevious eruptions have changed the topography and posed a risk to communities. A 1996 eruption in Iceland triggered a sudden glacial flood, which, per a Smithsonian report, was preceded by \"an unusual sequence\" of earthquakes.\n\nThe report notes that extreme events like these have released gases that caused acid haze, which perturbed the weather in Western Eurasia, the North Atlantic, and the Arctic. Some of the impacts of this haze included \"crop failures, livestock and fish deaths, and various illnesses, including fluorine poisoning.\"\n\nThe World Economic Forum has previously stated that, while some melting is now inevitable, humans \"can still avoid the worst impacts by urgently cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Top 10: Most powerful aircraft ever made",
    "fullText": "The power of modern aircraft is staggering, and these incredible machines grow ever more powerful.\n\nWhen the Heinkel He 178, the first pure turbojet aircraft, first flew in 1939, it did so with 4.41 kilonewtons (kN) of thrust; the number 1 entry in our list has a quite bonkers 1776kN. Here are the 10 Most Powerful Planes ever made:\n\nQuick note: Science geeks can rightly be pedantic about the units used to measure thrust; we will use kilonewtons, which measure force, but we will use casual rather than scientific language and sometimes use the word ‘power’ or ‘thrust’. Thrust levels, where possible, are given as static at sea level\n\nThe massive C-5M Galaxy is the US Air Force’s heaviest and largest aircraft. This strategic transport plane has a maximum weight of 840,000 pounds (381,024 kilograms), and moving such a massive bulk requires enormous force, and the C-5M relies on four huge engines.\n\nThe C-5M has four General Electric F-138-GE100 engines, each offering up a thwacking 51,250Ibfs of thrust; this is 227 kilonewtons or 912Kn in total. This is a lot of muscle, and considering the hefty loads the C-5M can take, including two M1 Abrams main battle tanks, this is much needed.\n\nThe C-5 is a giant machine, and until the Soviet An-124 arrived on the scene in 1986, the Galaxy was the world’s largest aeroplane. The C-5 is 75.31 metres (247 ft) long with a wingspan of 67.89 metres (223 ft) and a height of 19.84 m (65 ft).\n\nThough the early C-5 (which first flew in 1968) was fraught with technical issues, the C-5M seems to have rectified most of them. It is more reliable and more powerful. In 2009, it smashed a series of world records, mostly relating to climb rate with a given payload and altitudes reached.\n\nTwo airliners of the 1960s were far faster than their modern equivalents and were even faster than today’s F-35 and Super Hornet fighters: the Anglo-French Concorde and the Soviet Tu-144. While modern airliners travel below the speed of sound (Mach 1), both the Concorde and Tu-144 could go more than double that, exceeding Mach 2.\n\nSuch high speeds demanded an extremely exacting combination of shaping, materials and power, especially as these were not quick dashes into Mach 2 as fighter aircraft do, but prolonged cruises. The Cold War was on during the Tu-144 and Concorde’s development, and there was much international prestige to be won from becoming the leader in the new field of supersonic transport.\n\nThe Soviet equivalent of Concorde was bigger, faster and more powerful. Concorde had a maximum thrust of 677 kN, while the Tu-144 had 960 kN (some sources put the figure as 800kN). This did not make the Tu-144 better, as, in most ways, it was an inferior design.\n\nThe Soviet Tu-144 first flew on 31 December 1968, two months before the Concorde. This made it the first genuinely supersonic airliner to fly, but then went onto crash at the 1973 Paris air show. After a short, disastrous service life, the Tu-144 was withdrawn from passenger service (and later freight service). Surprisingly, one ended its life in the service of NASA. 16 Tu-144s were built.\n\nThe heaviest combat aircraft ever flown, maxing out at 275,000 kg (606,271 lb) the same as 45 adult elephants, the Soviet Tu-160 heavy bomber remains in service today. It is as fast as Concorde was, topping at just over twice the speed of sound. The Tupolev Tu-160 can carry 45,000 kg (99,208 lb) of air-launched weapons, including nuclear missiles.\n\nIn many ways it’s like a scaled-up version of the US B-1 bomber, and the Tu-160 also employs variable geometry ‘swing-wings’ to achieve efficiency for both high-speed flight and benign take-off and landing characteristics at lower speeds. Compared to the B-1B, the Tu-160 has much more thrust, boasting 980 kilonewtons to the B-1B’s 547.\n\nComparison with the US B-1B is hard to resist, and it is interesting to note that the original B-1, the B-1A, was faster than the Tu-160, but the actual aircraft that entered service, the B-1B, traded speed (it is capable of Mach 1.25 from an original Mach 2.2) for a greater degree of stealth through both materials, shaping and mission profile (moving to lower-level attack).\n\nThe Tu-160’s maximum thrust level involves the use of reheat (afterburner) to pump additional fuel into the aft of the engine to generate greater thrust at the cost of greatly reduced fuel efficiency. Each of the four Samara NK-321 afterburning turbofan engines deliver 245 kN with afterburner for a total of 980 kilonewtons.\n\nWhat may come of something of a surprise is the absence of military types from now on in this story, because today’s airliners have staggering amounts of thrust. The Boeing 777 is the most powerful (and largest) twin-engined aircraft ever flown, with 1026 kilonewtons of thrust at its disposal.\n\nTo put the sheer grunt of the 777 into perspective, it has the same thrust as 2.8 Vulcan B.2 bombers, a famously large and loud bomber used by Britain’s Royal Air Force.\n\nKey to the 777’s success was the General Electric GE90, a new generation of very big, very efficient and relatively quiet turbofan engines, the largest diameter then ever seen on an aircraft. It was also the first Boeing aircraft to be planned entirely with computer-assisted design (CAD).\n\nThe Boeing 777, a long-range wide-body airliner, first flew in 1994. Its timing was perfect as older aircraft like the DC-10 and TriStar were beginning to bow out. Here was a new superior aircraft that could do the job, on two rather than the three or four engines of earlier airliners. It proved a massive success, with 1738 made and counting.\n\nThe European Airbus A340-600 is a ‘rocket-ship’ of an airliner, and pilots tend to love it. The baseline A340 is a long-range, wide-body passenger airliner, a project officially launched in 1987. The Airbus A340-300 took its maiden flight on 25 October 1991.\n\nWhen we spoke to former A340 pilot Ian Black, he noted, “You have to remember that this was an aeroplane that had the capacity to carry 300+ passengers, 100+ tons of fuel and stacks of cargo, yet fully loaded it was still powerful; empty it was gloriously overpowered!”\n\nThe A340-600 is the longest member of the A340 series. Just over 75 metres (246 feet) it was for a time the longest airliner (being outdone by the 747-8’s arrival). It is the longest aircraft Airbus has ever made, 1.5 metres (5 feet) longer than the A350-1000 and around three metres (10 feet) more than the A380.\n\nThe A340-600 with the most thrust is the A340-600HGW version with 1080 kN thrust from four Rolls-Royce Trent 560 turbofans. The HGW is a beefed-up aircraft with a strengthened fuselage and more fuel. The charismatic A340 was produced from 1991 to 2018, and was replaced in the Airbus range by the more fuel-efficient twin-engined Airbus A350.\n\nThe ultimate member of the 747 family, the 747-8 is a longer aircraft, offering greater efficiency and harvesting new technology from Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. It is powered by a smaller version of the General Electric GEnx turbofan from the 787 Dreamliner. Each GEnx-2B67B turbofan engine generates 296 kN for a rather exciting total of 1184 kN.\n\nThe 747-8 is a beast, with a maximum take-off weight of 975,000 pounds (442,252kg), making it the heaviest Boeing airliner. The 747-8 is the largest variant of the 747, and Boeing's largest aircraft. It is not, however, Boeing’s longest aircraft, as the Boeing 777-9 is a cheeky 72cm (2 feet) longer.\n\nThe Boeing 747-8 is likely the ultimate in the much-loved Boeing 747 ‘Jumbo’ series, and shares a similar appearance but the superficial similarity hides many differences. For example, while outwardly, the wing appears little different to older 747s, it is a far more advanced design: it's thicker and deeper. The new wing can carry more fuel and fitted raked wingtips for greater efficiency.\n\nThough production ended in 2023 after only 13 years and 155 airframes, the good news for the 747-8 is that the United States Air Force has ordered two to serve as the next presidential aircraft, Air Force One. These will be designated VC-25Bs and are hoped to enter service in 2027.\n\nThe age of wide-body airliners began in 1970 with the American Boeing 747. A wide-body aircraft can accommodate two passenger aisles with seven or more seats abreast. The 747, which initially carried up to 440 passengers, could carry far more people than earlier aircraft. The aircraft proved popular with airlines, and soon many fell in love with the iconic ‘Jumbo-jet’ and its distinctive ‘hump’.\n\nIn 1989 a new version named 747-400 began operating. Enhancements included more efficient engine options, a 10% reduction in operating costs, lighter materials, and a new cockpit not requiring a Flight Engineer, reducing the flight crew to two.\n\nThe current most powerful version of the 747-400, the ER (Extended Range) and Extended Range Freighter (ERF, pictured) boast a whopping 1124 kilonewtons from their four engines. The 747-400ERF has a maximum take-off weight of 910,000 pounds (412,769 kg) and can carry a maximum payload of 248,600 pounds (112,763kg).\n\nThe 747-400ERF freight variant is a capable machine, with a maximum payload of 112,760 kg (248,600 pounds), around the same weight as 19 elephants (though why you would need to move so many elephants is anyone’s guess).\n\nThe Antonov An-225 was a giant, even among giants. Purpose-designed to move booster rockets and Buran orbiters (the Soviet space shuttle) for the space programme, the An-225 needed to be big. Prior to its development, the biggest aircraft in the world at the time, the Antonov An-124, was too small and not powerful enough for this new task.\n\nThe new design took much from the An-124 but added an additional pair of engines, a longer fuselage, and a completely new tail to handle the wake turbulence generated by the massive external loads carried ‘piggy-back ’on the aircraft's upper fuselage.\n\nThe Antonov An-225 Mriya (Ukrainian for ‘dream’) first flew in late December 1988 and was soon smashing a series of world records.  The An-225 set 214 national and 124 world records, including transporting the heaviest payload ever lifting by air, an astonishing 559,577 pounds (253,820 kg) – the same as 42 elephants!\n\nSix massive Progress D-18T turbofans powered it, each pumping out an awe-inspiring 229.5 kN for a grand total of 1377 kilonewtons.  Sadly, the only Antonov An-225 was destroyed at the Battle of Antonov Airport in Ukraine in February 2022, though there is an effort to fund and rebuild this fantastic machine.\n\nWith its full double-deck configuration and capacity to carry up to 853 passengers, The massive Airbus A380 airliner is in a class of its own. The A380’s maximum take-off weight is 1,267,658 pounds (575,000 kg), equivalent to 17 fully-loaded Lancaster bombers.\n\nRival firm Boeing explored double-deck designs, but only Airbus chose to develop a large wide-body double-decked airliner, and the A380 has earned an enviable reputation for comfort and space on long-haul flights. However, it has failed to achieve the commercial success Airbus hoped for.\n\nSuch an impressive aircraft needs a lot of power, and the most powerful A380 is the A380-842s of Qantas (pictured) and Emirates with their Rolls-Royce Trent 972-84 engines. The 972-84 can deliver a rather intense 356kN, but, in service, is limited to 341kN to preserve engine life (and is plenty). Multiply this by four, and you get an extremely hearty 1364 kilonewtons.\n\nDespite its popularity with passengers, the A380 has suffered because of its high price tag, the need to fill the large number of seats for each flight, and the adaptions airports need to make to accommodate this behemoth. Despite production ending in 2021, some predict something of a renaissance for the A380 with aircraft returning into service.\n\nThe incredible Stratolaunch Roc is the biggest aircraft flying and the most powerful. Used for the air launch of space rockets and hypersonic vehicles, this ‘mothership’ is powered by two six Pratt & Whitney PW4000 turbofans combining to give a massive maximum of 1776 kilonewtons of thrust.\n\nThe brainchild of Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen, the Roc is named for a legendary bird of prey big and strong enough to carry elephants in its talon; this is an appropriate name for this gargantuan aircraft. The Roc boasts a wingspan of 117 metres (or 385 feet) the largest of all aircraft, dwarfing the next biggest, the ‘Spruce Goose’ of 1947 with its relatively paltry 97.51 m (319 ft 11 in) wingspan.\n\nLike the twin aircraft of World War II the Roc has a dual-fuselage configuration. It has a high-wing design that allows for the launches of spacecraft and aircraft from the aircraft centreline and below the wing.\n\nThe enormous Roc can carry a payload of over half a million (500,000 lbs or 226,796 kg) and is not built for speed. Despite being the most powerful aircraft on this list, it is also the slowest with a cruising speed, at 250mph, more suitable for a 1940s airliner.\n\nFollow Hush-Kit's incredible aviation stories on Substack and X\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please click the Follow button above to see more like it from Autocar",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump zeroed in on what he calls America's \"roaring economy.\"\n\nThe president gave his annual speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. He opened the event focused on his administration's economic agenda, especially inflation rates and consumer prices.\n\n\"I inherited a nation in crisis with a stagnant economy,\" Trump told lawmakers, adding, \"A short time ago, we were a dead country. Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world.\"\n\nHere are the biggest notes on the economy from the speech.\n\nTrump said his administration has driven down inflation and mortgage rates, along with energy prices. He touted a strong stock market, and said the administration has \"lifted a record number of Americans off food stamps\" with their updated SNAP rules.\n\nHe blamed Democratic leaders for high inflation rates. \"Their policies created the high prices\" his administration was aiming to bring down, he said.\n\nThe consumer price index, a key measure of inflation, cooled slightly in January but remains about the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.\n\nThe president added that he and Republican allies delivered the \"largest tax cuts in American history\" in their latest budget bill, alongside promises to end taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security.\n\nHe did not introduce new tax policies early in the speech, but he did mention Trump Accounts, a newly-launched federal investment account for children that will be available in July.\n\nFor retirees, Trump announced a new plan to offer federal retirement matching contributions to Americans without employer-sponsored plans.\n\n\"My administration will give these oft-forgotten American workers, great people, the people that built our country, access to the same type of retirement plan offered to every federal worker. We will match your contribution with up to $1,000 each year,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he \"wants to stop all payments to big insurance companies.\" He underscored his \"Great Healthcare Plan,\" which outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums, implement cost-sharing programs, and increase cost transparency.\n\n\"I am also ending the wildly inflated cost of prescription drugs,\" he said. The Trump administration officially launched TrumpRx a few weeks ago, a direct-to-consumer prescription platform. The president spoke specifically about affordable IVF drugs.\n\nThe administration and Republican lawmakers opted not to renew enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies at the end of 2025. The credits helped lower-and middle-income families afford marketplace insurance coverage, and millions have dropped their plans so far due to skyrocketing 2026 premium costs.\n\nThe president said his administration is lowering housing prices.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nHe spoke about his January executive order to ban large Wall Street investment firms from buying single-family homes. \"Now I am asking Congress to make that ban permanent, because homes are for people, not corporations,\" he said.\n\nHousing market analysts told Business Insider that this policy is unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, typically in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nTrump also said his administration is boosting jobs in the construction sector, one of the few parts of the labor market alongside healthcare that has seen growth this year.\n\nThroughout his second term, the Trump administration has leaned into affordability issues, especially high prices on consumer goods. The White House has touted budget changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tax breaks for middle- and higher-income Americans. In some cases, the president has reached across the aisle for economic priorities, like a long-time Democrat-backed policy to rein in credit card rates.\n\nAs for the job market, growth has been the lowest in decades aside from recessions, and Trump's Department of Government Efficiency took a sizable swing at the federal workforce. The administration hopes the pending appointment of former Wall Streeter Kevin Warsh to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be a path toward lower interest rates in 2026, which could juice hiring — at the risk of growing inflation.\n\nA YouGov and MarketWatch poll published February 24 found that 83% of Americans believe affordability has worsened or remained stagnant under Trump's second term.\n\nTrump is expected to speak for at least two hours this evening, covering topics like the Supreme Court tariff ruling, AI investment, immigration, and foreign policy.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump addressed the nation in front of Congress and touted his economic policies, including the tariffs that SCOTUS struck down.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump called the Supreme Court's decision that overturned his signature tariffs \"unfortunate\" during his State of the Union address.\n\nTrump addressed the nation several days after the Supreme Court ruled against most of his 2025 tariffs that were enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nDespite this setback to his economic agenda, which he touted on Tuesday, Trump said he wouldn't need to make new trade deals, even though he used the now-struck-down tariffs as his primary negotiating tool, because other countries were happy with the deals made so far.\n\nImmediately after the SCOTUS ruling, Trump signed an executive order to impose a 10% \"global tariff\" under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Unlike the IEEPA tariffs, any duties under Section 122 last 150 days before requiring congressional approval.\n\n\"They're a little more complex, but they're actually probably better, leading to a solution that will be even stronger than before. Congressional action will not be necessary,\" said Trump of his new 10% \"global tariffs\" at the State of the Union.\n\n\"It's already time-tested and approved, and as time goes by, I believe the tariffs paid for by foreign countries will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern-day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love,\" Trump added.\n\nAccording to the Customs and Border Protection, the US has collected around $129 billion in revenue under the IEEPA tariffs. Companies large and small have now begun the messy process of litigating for tariff refunds, and some, like FedEx, have filed lawsuits at the Court of International Trade.\n\nRecent studies found that it was companies and consumers who pay for the majority of tariffs, including a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that said, \"90% of the tariffs' economic burden fell on US firms and consumers.\"\n\nThe landmark SCOTUS ruling was made at a time when concerns about affordability and economic health were widespread. Recent data shows that while the US economy grew 2.2% in 2025, job creation stalled. Economists previously told Business Insider that this pattern is widening the gap between the wealthy and everyone else.\n\nAccording to a February poll jointly conducted by ABC News, The Washington Post, and Ipsos, a majority of Americans disapprove of how the president is handling inflation, tariffs, relations with other countries, immigration, and the economy.\n\nAccording to the University of Michigan's monthly consumer sentiment survey, consumer confidence in February is more than 12% lower than in the same month in 2025.\n\nDana M Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board, commented in its February economic sentiment research that though consumers' pessimistic expectations for the future \"eased somewhat,\" confidence remains \"well below\" the four-year peak achieved in November 2024.",

A White House spokesperson confirmed the report to Business Insider but did not provide additional details.\n\nThe announcement comes as Big Tech companies spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build AI infrastructure and data centers, driving up electricity demand in the US. Utility costs are rising across the US as a result of the increased electricity demand for data centers, a report from the Center for American Progress found.\n\nTrump has previously said Americans should not have to pay higher electricity costs due to data centers, and that the companies that build them \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nDecisions about utility costs are typically made at the state and local levels. It's unclear how the newly announced pledges would be implemented.",

    "description": "Other expat mothers became Roberta Maretti's lifeline. \"Together, we made unfamiliar places feel like home,\" she said.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Roberta Maretti, 50, author of \"Where the World Took Me.\" Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in Italy, and moved around a lot when I was growing up. By the time I finished high school, I'd lived in several countries across Europe and Asia.\n\nAfter that, I moved again on my own, this time to study hotel management in Switzerland.\n\nGrowing up abroad made me inherently multicultural. I absorbed new foods, languages, traditions — and learned early that identity isn't tied to one place.\n\nAfter working at the Manchester Airport Hilton in the UK, I transferred internally to Chicago, then San Juan, Puerto Rico, and later to Shanghai.\n\nIt was in Manchester that I met my now ex-husband, who is German, and together we built a life that spanned countries. After finding out I was pregnant, I decided to step away from the hotel industry to focus on raising our children.\n\nOur daughter was born in Shanghai in 2005, and just a few months later, we moved to Sanya, a small island city in China. By the time she turned 3, we had relocated to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. My son came next, and he was only 1 when we relocated to Beijing and then Singapore.\n\nEven with constant moves, my children made friends, attended school, and learned to adapt almost effortlessly.\n\nThe hardest part was always the goodbyes — leaving friends, routines, and the familiar behind. Yet each move strengthened their resilience, curiosity, and open-mindedness.\n\nFood became our anchor. Shared meals — a curry with roti prata in Little India, dumplings sizzling on Shanghai streets, or a simple bowl of congee in Kuala Lumpur — transported us instantly to the heart of each city, making each place feel like home.\n\nBuilding a sense of belonging took effort, and expat communities were essential. Other expat mothers became my lifeline, supporting one another through playdates, outings, and the ups and downs of life abroad. Together, we made unfamiliar places feel like home.\n\nIn Singapore and Malaysia, where English is widely spoken, our circles often included locals, while in China, expat networks became central. Still, small gestures from locals left a lasting mark — like Mr Wong, our school bus driver in Beijing, who won over my young son. I remember him spreading his arms wide as my son toddled toward him to be picked up.\n\nMoments like these showed me that kindness transcends language, and that home isn't just a place on a map.\n\nChina, especially, pushed me to my limits. Our children's blonde curls and bright eyes made them instant curiosities — strangers would stop us on the street, reach out to touch them, even lift them from their strollers. I remember feeling overwhelmed by the constant invasion of our privacy.\n\nI understood the cultural curiosity and didn't blame anyone, but emotionally, it was challenging. Those years in China tested my personal boundaries and heightened my sense of maternal protectiveness.\n\nFollowing my divorce, staying in Singapore was no longer an option. With the rest of my family based in Belgium, moving to Brussels was the most stable choice for my children and me.\n\nIn 2013, after nearly a decade in Asia, coming \"home\" was disorienting — the food, pace, and climate we'd grown used to were gone. We faced new schools, four distinct seasons, and the challenge of re-establishing myself as a single mother and her children. Yet, over time, we found our rhythm.\n\nAll of these experiences have shaped me as a woman, a mother, and an expat.\n\nIn 2014, back in Brussels, I opened a gelateria, Il Monello, with my brother. Running a small business has been both grounding and rewarding, allowing me to connect with people in a new way.\n\nNow that my daughter is turning 21 and my son is 18, I crave space, light, and a slower rhythm. One thing is certain: I will never stop travelling, it's part of who I am.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad? Contact the editor at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is appealing a judge's order that blocks him from punishing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot, for participating in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders, according to a court filing on Tuesday.\n\nJustice Department officials filed a notice that they wil ask a panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the Feb. 12 ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon.\n\nKelly, who represents Arizona, said in a social media post that the only reason for Hegseth to appeal is to “keep trampling on the free speech rights of retired veterans and silence dissent.”\n\n“These guys don’t know when to quit,\" Kelly wrote on his X account.\n\nHegseth had vowed to immediately appeal Leon’s decision. “Sedition is sedition, ‘Captain,’” he posted on his X account, referring to Kelly by his rank at retirement.\n\nIn November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration. Republican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later.\n\nEarlier this month, a Washington grand jury declined to indict the lawmakers over the video.\n\nKelly sued in federal court to block his Jan. 5 censure from Hegseth. Leon’s order prohibits the Pentagon from implementing or enforcing Kelly’s punishment while his lawsuit is pending.\n\nLeon ruled that Pentagon officials not only violated Kelly’s First Amendment free speech rights, but they also “threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees.” The judge invoked an old-fashioned rebuke -- “Horsefeathers!” -- in response to the government’s claim that Kelly is trying to exempt himself from the rules of military justice.\n\n“To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more respect from their Government, and our Constitution demands they receive it!” wrote Leon, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush.\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Slotkin. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence agencies.",

    "fullText": "Toying with a hypothetical on Tuesday’s “Behind the Table” podcast, “The View” co-host Joy Behar admitted she would bend her knee to President Trump if it meant getting her family out of jail – but only for a bit.\n\nIn conversation with executive produce Brian Teta, Behar touched on recent “The View” guest host Savannah Chrisley and her support for Trump. Chrisley has said she’s identified as Republican for a long time, but turned to Trump after her parents served two years in prison for tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy before he pardoned them.\n\nBehar said it is easy to be a Republican without supporting Trump, but she might also be pro-Trump if her family ever needed an out-of-jail card.\n\n“You can be a Republican and still be anti-Donald Trump,” Behar said. “He’s not a Republican. People are getting hip to that now. You see the polls, they’re going, everybody’s turning on him. He’s going to go out there tonight right behind the eight ball, and he knows it, too, which makes him more hyperbolic. He’ll be bragging about not only can he read, he can run, he can walk.”\n\nShe added after asked by Teta if she would support him for her family’s freedom like Chrisley: “I would do it, of course, for my family. But then I would trash him afterwards … But I don’t come from a family like that.”\n\nWatch the full “Behind the Table” interview below:\n\nAtlanta-based millionaire Todd Chrisley started out in real estate before pivoting to reality TV once the 2008 recession hit his company Chrisley Asset Management. Chrisley and his second wife Julie received a combined 19-year prison sentence for bank fraud and tax evasion in June 2022. Trump gave both a full pardon in May 2025. Savannah fought tirelessly for a presidential pardon to free her parents and even spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2024.\n\nA new Lifetime docuseries titled “The Chrisleys: Back to Reality” premiered in September 2025. It gave viewers an “unfiltered, deeply personal look” at the family’s journey and introduces the real Chrisleys as they navigate this new chapter.\n\nThe post Joy Behar Admits She Would Bend to Trump if He Could Get Her Family Out of Jail: ‘I Would Trash Him Afterwards’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Japan's stock market has been on a red-hot rally after decades of lackluster performance — and Goldman Sachs says it's not done yet.\n\nThe country's benchmark Nikkei 225 index has been hitting record highs since 2024, gaining 52% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the broader Topix index is up 12% this year and 41% over the past 12 months.\n\n\"We believe that we're still very much in the upward phase of the current market cycle, and we think that market cycle started in the autumn of 2022,\" Bruce Kirk, Goldman's chief Japan equity strategist, said on the bank's \"Exchanges\" podcast published on Tuesday.\n\nJapanese stocks have extended their gains this year following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory earlier this month, which investors see as reinforcing political stability and pro-growth policies.\n\nHowever, the next stage may be more challenging. It hinges on whether Japan moves into what he calls the \"delivery phase\" — where policymakers and corporate Japan prove they can follow through on the expectations investors have built up.\n\n\"If that top-down pressure can align with what investors, both foreign and domestic, are trying to do from a bottom-up perspective in terms of engaging with management, then I think we could see a really interesting dynamic moving forward,\" Kirk said.\n\nA recovery in foreign investment is another reason Goldman sees room for the rally to continue.\n\nAfter a sharp 24% peak-to-trough correction in Topix following the massive sell-off of summer 2024 that spooked investors, a wave of foreign money is coming in again.\n\nRecent data showed 1.8 trillion Japanese yen in net buying in the week before the election — the second-highest weekly total on record.\n\nStill, foreign positioning is not stretched, Kirk said. Mutual funds remain underweight Japan, and foreign allocations are only back to levels seen at the start of 2012, when former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policy agenda of aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms first sparked meaningful gains in Japanese equities.\n\nFor the rally to be sustained, investors need proof of improving corporate profitability. Kirk said return on equity has flatlined around 9% to 10%, despite the market's sharp rise.\n\n\"I think the key to the next phase will be ROE improvement,\" Kirk said.",

In a post made to X as Spanberger was discussing the president’s immigration crackdown, the official @RapidResponse47 account wrote that the governor should “spare us the sanctimonious bulls--t.” “For Spanberger, criminal illegals > Americans‚” the post continued, before going on to accuse Spanberger of “repeatedly undermin[ing] border security” during her time in Congress and terminating Virginia’s agreement with ICE weeks after becoming governor.",

    "description": "Here's what it was like for one reporter to be in the room for the longest State of the Union in American history.",
    "fullText": "It ended up being the longest State of the Union speech in American history.\n\nI was one of over 100 reporters seated in the House chamber during President Donald Trump's address on Tuesday night, when the president shattered the record for the longest speech at just over 107 minutes.\n\nOver the course of the lengthy speech, the mood gradually devolved, eventually leading to outright bickering. In fact, there was only one strong bipartisan moment — and it happened to involve athletes walking into the press gallery.\n\nThat's just past the 99 minutes he spoke for last year, when he previously set the record for the longest speech to a joint session of Congress.\n\nThe speech hit many of the president's usual talking points, sprinkled in a few policy proposals, and emphasized the theatrics.\n\nJust like in years past, the speech had its share of drama, with lawmakers heckling the president and one even being escorted out.\n\nHere's what it was like, and what I saw during the speech.\n\nIf you're watching the State of the Union from home, you might be wondering where the reporters covering the speech in person are sitting.\n\nThe answer: Behind the president, in a gallery above the floor of the House chamber. It's the same floor where the dignitaries' guests sit.\n\nIn normal times, reporters can come and go freely from the gallery. Due to the high demand to watch this major speech, I had to get a press pass, which gave me access to an assigned seat.\n\nRoughly 140 reporters and photographers were up in the gallery with me — about 90 of them in seats, and another 50 standing.\n\nReporters are also strictly forbidden from taking photos in the House chamber, so I'm not able to share any firsthand look at the gallery.\n\nLast year, Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas was thrown out of the House chamber for loudly protesting during Trump's speech.\n\nThis year, he was thrown out again.\n\nAt the beginning of the speech, Green quietly unfurled a sign declaring that \"Black People Aren't Apes,\" an apparent reference to a video that was briefly posted on Trump's Truth Social account earlier this month that depicted President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nRepublican lawmakers were incensed, with Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma at one point trying to tear the sign out of Green's hand.\n\nUltimately, a staffer led Green out of the chamber.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into Trump's speech, we were met with a surprise — members of the US Men's Hockey team streamed into the press gallery, bringing the room's attention toward an area where all the reporters were sitting.\n\nLawmakers broke into cheers and applause. It was one of the few bipartisan moments of applause of the whole night.\n\nIn the House, the chamber is evenly divided between the Republican side and the Democratic side. But you wouldn't know it from Tuesday night's speech.\n\nThere were noticeably fewer Democrats on hand, with several seats appearing to be empty on their side of the aisle. Several Republicans, apparently taking advantage of the open space, even sat on the Democratic side.\n\nMany of the Democratic women who did attend could be seen wearing white, a color associated with the suffragette movement.\n\nAhead of the speech, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged Democrats to either boycott the speech or sit in silent protest, an apparent effort to avoid the disruptions that marked last year's speech.\n\nRep. Becca Balint of Vermont was among dozens of Democrats who opted to attend the \"People's State of the Union\" — a rally sponsored by the liberal groups MeidasTouch and MoveOn that was held on the National Mall — instead of the speech.\n\n\"I want to be surrounded by positive people who are really thinking about how to bring this country together,\" Balint told me. \"I cannot normalize this anymore. I just can't.\"\n\nOne Democrat who chose to attend, Rep. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, told me before the speech that he believes it's \"important for me to be there to see what the president has to say.\"\n\n\"People can choose to do what they want, but I feel like it's part of my job to show up,\" Vasquez said.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court voted to strike down many of Trump's tariffs on Friday, many wondered if there would be fireworkers at Tuesday night's speech.\n\nAfter all, Supreme Court justices are seated directly in front of the president.\n\nUltimately, the confrontation never came, but it was a little awkward.\n\nJust four of the nine justices showed up for Trump's speech: John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and Elena Kagan. All of those justices except Kavanaugh voted to strike down the tariffs.\n\nTrump shook each of the justices' hands before taking the podium, and the justices sat stone-faced when Trump mentioned the court's \"very unfortunate\" ruling.\n\nAs Trump spoke about the tariffs, scattered laughter could be heard throughout the chamber.\n\n\"They're right in front of you!\" someone from the Democratic side could be heard yelling at one point, referring to the justices.\n\nWith the exception of Al Green, the first hour of Trump's speech was relatively free of major disruptions.\n\nA major turning point was when Trump discussed funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota began loudly heckling Trump over the killing of two American citizens by immigration agents in Minneapolis. Trump at one point fired back, saying the lawmakers should be \"ashamed\" of themselves.\n\nThe heckling continued as Trump moved on to election security and transgender issues.\n\n\"These people are crazy,\" Trump remarked at one point.\n\nThe president, along with every member of the House and Senate, is entitled to bring a guest to the speech. Generally, they sit in the gallery, which sits one floor above the chamber.\n\nSen. Rick Scott of Florida brought \"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary. Several Democrats brought Epstein survivors. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina invited David Ellison, Paramount's CEO.\n\nTrump brought Erika Kirk, who succeeded her late husband Charlie Kirk as the head of Turning Point USA, after he was killed in September.\n\nOne person who attended last year, but wasn't there this year: Elon Musk.\n\nAfter the speech, many lawmakers and Cabinet secretaries head to Statuary Hall, where journalists and TV cameras await them.\n\nIt's not unlike the \"spin room\" at a presidential debate, where each side gives its take on what happened that night.\n\nRepublican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee snagged an aisle seat and got to shake Trump's hand, though he wouldn't tell me what the two talked about.\n\n\"It was about our cat, and our barn that we named after him,\" Burchett joked.\n\nBurchett said Trump's speech was so long because he \"had a lot of successes that he needed to talk about.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Sarah McBride of Delaware, on the other hand, told reporters that Trump's speech was full of lies while defending the reaction of lawmakers like Tlaib and Omar.\n\n\"This administration has literally killed American citizens under the guise of addressing immigration,\" McBride said.",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nExperts working in the Tomb of Cerberus in Giugliano, an area in Naples, unsealed a 2,000-year-old sarcophagus.\n\nInside they found the remains of a shockingly well-preserved body lying face-up and covered in a shroud.\n\nOngoing analysis of the contents of the sarcophagus could yield new social, cultural, and scientific insight into ancient life.\n\nAfter initially probing a 2,000-year-old sarcophagus in Naples with a micro camera, archaeologists were encouraged enough by what they saw to step inside this sealed tomb for the first time. But once they opened a passage inside the sarcophagus sealed shut for thousands of years, they were shocked by the condition of what they found.\n\nThe team of archaeologists, led by Simona Formola, investigating the Tomb of Cerberus in the northwest Naples city of Giugliano discovered a person laying face-up in what they considered an “excellent state of preservation,” according to a translated statement from the Superintendent of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape for the Naples Metropolitan Area. The individual was covered by a shroud and surrounded by a litany of goods that included several ointment jars and body-cleaning tools often used in the burial process.\n\nThe team believes the particular care given to the deceased, coupled with the objects found near the body, suggest the person in the sarcophagus was the family member for whom the mausoleum was originally built.\n\n“The Tomb of Cerberus continues to provide valuable information on the Phlegraean territory near Liternum,” Marian Nuzzo, a superintendent with the Italian Ministry of Culture, said in a statement, “expanding knowledge of the past, and offering opportunities for research of a multidisciplinary nature.”\n\nThe team now has a new treasure trove of information to mine. “Laboratory analyses conducted on samples taken from the burials and depositional beds have returned a considerable amount of data regarding the treatment of the body of the deceased and the funerary rituals implanted, considerably enriching the panorama of our knowledge,” Nuzzo said.\n\nThe team believes the shroud was likely mineralized due to the unique climatic conditions inside the burial chamber. Fabric analysis is ongoing, but the archaeologists hopes to determine the structure, type, and quality of the yarn used within the tomb. They hope that information will help glean additional social and cultural details.\n\nAs DNA analysis of the remains is ongoing, the team also continues to analyze the organic substances, including pollen, found within the sarcophagus. They’ve already learned that the body was likely treated with creams based on Chenopodium—also known as goosefoot—and absinthe, meant to improve preservation.\n\nThe ministry hopes continued sampling and analyzing of all the aspects found within the sarcophagus will yield additional details about the surrounding necropolis that can help tell a broader picture of the social and cultural makeup of Naples 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Hiring only for “professional management” doesn’t work, Steve Jobs said.",
    "fullText": "It’s been more than a decade since we lost Steve Jobs, the mastermind behind some of the biggest technological innovations in history. Today would have been his 71st birthday.\n\nBut Jobs’ outsize influence as Apple’s cofounder and leader leaves a lasting impression on managers and employees alike. And one of his most unwavering beliefs might surprise those who aspire to his level of success.\n\nWho does Jobs believe make the best managers?\n\nWhat was Jobs' approach to recruiting talent?\n\nWhat made Steve Jobs reject professional managers?\n\nHow did Jobs prioritize collaboration at Apple?\n\nWhen Jobs and Apple’s other cofounders, including Steve Wozniak, first realized how big their company would be, they decided to go out and hire what they called “professional management,” or folks who just knew how to manage people. But it quickly backfired.\n\n“It didn’t work at all,” Jobs said in a mid-1980s interview. “Most of them were bozos. They knew how to manage, but they didn’t know how to do anything.”\n\nJobs’ comment gets at the crux of a central debate in management: whether managers should actually want to be managers at all. Jobs argued the people who were least expecting to be leaders ended up being the best managers in the long run. That’s because other employees were more likely to actually learn something from them because they had mastered their skill set—rather than focusing only on management techniques.\n\nThat’s the first of Jobs’ best management tips: elevating to management those who perform at the highest levels.\n\n“You know who the best managers are. They’re the great individual contributors who never ever want to be a manager, but decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be able to do as good a job as that,” Jobs said in the same interview.\n\nJobs took a gamble on Debi Coleman, a member of the Macintosh team who was 32 years old at the time he promoted her. She’d studied English literature in college but earned her MBA from Stanford University and proved herself to be an exceptional financial manager.\n\n“There’s no way in the world anybody else would give me this chance to run this kind of operation,” Coleman said in a 1980s interview. “I don’t kid myself about … that there’s an incredible high risk—both for myself personally and professionally, and for Apple as a company—and put a person like myself in this job.”\n\nApple was “betting on a lot of things” when it made her a financial manager, Coleman said. The company was “betting that my skills and organizational effectiveness override” a lack of tech and manufacturing experience. Coleman went on to become chief financial officer of Apple and was referred to as one of Silicon Valley’s “most prominent technology executives.” She died in 2021.",

    "fullText": "As the Northeast U.S. begins to dig out from a powerful blizzard, more than two dozen flights in and out of Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) in Fort Myers were canceled on Tuesday, Feb. 24, according to FlightAware.\n\nThe blizzard caused over 2,000 U.S. flights to be canceled Tuesday, with the bulk of disruptions in and around New York, Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nAcross Florida airports, 114 flights were delayed and around 385 canceled, with most at Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa.\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 23, the winter storm caused at least 90 cancellations and 15 delays at RSW.\n\nAirlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Southwest and United Airlines, are waiving change fees and fare differences for those who planned to travel to the hardest-hit areas and now need to change plans.\n\nAccording to FlightAware.com, which provides real-time flight information, as of 7:30 a.m., the following delays and cancellations of flights have been reported within, into or out of the United States today, Feb. 24:\n\nFlight cancellations and delays at RSW as of 10 a.m., Feb. 23, according to FlightAware:\n\nHere's the breakdown by airport as of around 7:30 a.m. Feb. 24. Click the airport names for detailed flight info and updated numbers throughout the day.\n\nDon't wait until you're already at the airport to check your flight. Monitor your flight early and often, starting now, as cancellations will increase as the weather conditions worsen.\n\nDownload your airline’s mobile app and turn on push and text notifications for alerts about your flight. Some apps have a “Where’s My Plane?” feature that lets you see whether the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight has arrived, is delayed en route, or hasn’t departed yet from its previous airport. That can be an early signal of trouble.\n\nIf your flight is canceled, use the airline's mobile app to rebook as soon as possible, according to Scott Keyes, founder of Going. If you need to talk to someone, Keyes suggests calling one of the carrier’s international lines.\n\n\"The best thing travelers can do is to be as proactive as possible switching to a new flight,” Keyes told USA TODAY. “When a flight gets canceled, all of a sudden hundreds of passengers need new itineraries. There may only be a handful of seats left on the best flights, and it's a first-come, first-(served) endeavor.”\n\nIf your flight is canceled for any reason, you’re entitled to a full refund if you choose not to fly on alternative itineraries offered by your airline. The same goes for “significant” delays or changes.\n\nYou can get all of Florida’s best content directly in your inbox each weekday day by signing up for the free newsletter, Florida TODAY.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: RSW airport flight cancellations today after Northeast blizzard",

    "description": "\"Congressional action will not be necessary. It's already time-tested and approved\"",
    "fullText": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) dutifully stood and applauded as President Donald Trump hyped his new mechanism for unilaterally levying tariffs, for which he claimed, “Congressional action will not be necessary.”\n\nTrump slammed the Supreme Court for striking down his unconstitutional global tariffs last week, but promised they will remain in place and foreign countries will continue to negotiate with him.\n\nOther nations “will continue to work along the same successful path that we had negotiated before the Supreme Court’s unfortunate involvement. So despite the disappointing ruling, these powerful country-saving — it’s saving our country, the kind of money we’re taking in — peace-protecting — many of the wars I’ve settled was because of the threat of tariffs,” Trump said, adding:\n\nI wouldn’t have been able to settle them without it. Will remain in place under fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes. And they have been tested for a long time. They’re a little more complex, but they’re actually probably better, leading to a solution that will be even stronger than before.\n\nCongressional action will not be necessary. It’s already time-tested and approved. And as time goes by, I believe the tariffs paid for by foreign countries will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern-day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love. Moving forward, factories, jobs, investment, and trillions and trillions of dollars will continue pouring into the United States of America because we finally have a president who puts America first. I put America first. I love America.\n\nJohnson rose along with Vice President JD Vance and the rest of the Republicans in the chamber to applaud the line, despite the fact that Congress will have to vote to continue Trump’s latest round of tariffs.\n\nTrump used Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to levy an additional 15% global tariff on the U.S.’s trading partners following the Supreme Court’s ruling. Section 122 requires Congress to vote on keeping the levies in place after 150 days and is all but certain to be challenged in court as the Constitution solely empowers Congress to levy tariffs.\n\nWatch the clip above via MS NOW.\n\nThe post Mike Johnson Stands and Applauds After Trump Says ‘Congressional Action Won’t Be Necessary’ on New Tariffs first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Bodo/Glimt just keep on defying the odds.\n\nThe Norwegian team, based around 70 miles into the Arctic Circle, have forged a reputation for upsets, but on Tuesday night in Milan they produced one of the biggest in Champions League history.\n\nFacing three-time winners Inter Milan - beaten by Paris St-Germain in the final of this competition just over nine months ago - Bodo had a daunting task, even if they held a 3-1 lead from the first leg.\n\nYet they rose to the occasion once more - just like they had done in beating Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the group phase.\n\nIt was another resolute and determined display in Italy to complete a home and away double over Cristian Chivu's men, first to repel the numerous first-half Inter attacks before scoring twice to ultimately leave the Serie A leaders with too much to do.\n\nWinners 2-1 on the night, Bodo's 5-2 aggregate success secured their place in the Champions League last 16 for the first time, where they will face either Manchester City or Sporting.\n\n\"It is a historical moment for Bodo and I think also for Norwegian football,\" said boss Kjetil Knutsen.\n\nJens Petter Hauge was again inspirational, scoring his sixth goal in the competition this season for the opener, before setting up Hakon Evjen's lovely finish for the second.\n\n\"It sounds not true, but we are there, among the last teams in the competition,\" added the forward, who was back in the San Siro where he had a two-year spell at AC Milan.\n\n\"It will be really exciting to see what the next two games bring.\"\n\nBodo/Glimt stun Inter in Milan to reach last 16\n\nBodo/Glimt are the first Norwegian side to progress in a knockout-stage tie in the Champions League and the first overall in the European Cup since Lillestrom in the first round in 1987-88.\n\nThe Norwegians are the first team from outside of Europe's big five leagues to win four consecutive games in a European Cup/Champions League campaign against opponents from those leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy & France) since Ajax in 1971-72, who went on to win the European Cup that season.\n\nJens Petter Hauge has scored six goals for Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League this season; the most ever by a Norwegian player for a Norwegian club in a single edition of the European Cup/Champions League.\n\nThis fairytale run to the knockouts will have felt unlikely for Bodo after failing to win their first six league phase games, meaning they were left needing results against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to qualify for the play-offs.\n\nAnd, against the odds, they provided them.\n\nA 3-1 victory over Pep Guardiola's men brought deserved attention and acclaim, but it was no one-off as Bodo overcame Atleti 2-1 in Madrid to claim a play-off spot.\n\nKnutsen's side lost to Spurs in the Europa League semi-finals last season, having become the first Norwegian side to reach the last four of a major European competition.\n\nKey to their success has often been their ability to make their home games as tough as possible.\n\nIn the north of Norway, Bodo can often be bitterly cold, snowy and windy during the long winter months, with temperatures deep into minus figures.\n\nThe difficult weather conditions mean the team play on an artificial pitch made of plastic, something many sides used to playing on grass find difficult to deal with.\n\nThose aspects, coupled with the players' determination and strong belief in their ability, means many have left Bodo defeated.\n\nThey famously thrashed Jose Mourinho's Roma 6-1 at home in the Europa Conference League five years ago, while Celtic, Besiktas, Porto and Lazio have also been victims in recent years.\n\nManchester City won't relish another meeting in the last 16 if they are drawn together, with Bodo buoyant after proving they have nothing to fear against Europe's top sides.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" captain Patrick Berg told Canal+.\n\n\"For the club and city it's unbelievable. I don't think people thought we could beat Manchester City, Atletico and now Inter two times.\n\nThis is a step into the unknown for Bodo as they prepare to play in the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time.\n\nBut their run to the Europa League semis in the previous campaign will give them belief - and provide hope to every small club of what can still be achieved in Uefa's major competitions.\n\nAnd, for however long this journey continues, they will be backed by the now familiar sight of their vocal fans, who were unmissable at the San Siro decked out all in yellow and with scarves held in the air.\n\n\"I am so proud, we are a team from a small town,\" added Knutsen.\n\n\"I really hope we show if we can do it, then everyone can do it. For me that's the most beautiful thing of the whole story.\"",

    "description": "The Golden Eagles wrap up their home slate for the year with a visit from the Musketeers.",
    "fullText": "I’m going to keep this preview for the final home game on the Marquette women’s basketball schedule pretty straight forward.\n\nFirst, it’s Senior Day at the McGuire Center. Marquette will be honoring seven of the eight seniors listed on the roster in a pregame ceremony as they appear for their final regular season home game. The lone exception to the list is Aryelle Stevens who has been out all year after an Achilles tear last summer. Marquette isn’t explicitly saying she’s returning, merely not saying she’s departing. With seven senior players and five student managers to honor, get yourself to the building early for the festivities.\n\nSecond, Marquette is on a four game losing streak. They shouldn’t be after coughing up a fourth quarter lead at Creighton and letting Seton Hall rally and run away from them in Milwaukee, but that’s where we are. Perhaps more disappointingly, Marquette looked lifeless on the road against Villanova on Sunday after putting up a pretty solid fight against #1 UConn in the third of the four straight losses.\n\nThird, Marquette is trying to stay out of the opening day tripleheader at the Big East tournament. Some of this work may get done for them as 11-8 St. John’s wraps up with UConn, so all the Golden Eagles need to do is avoid dropping either of their final two games, and they will finish ahead of the Red Storm. That alone would be enough to clinch a top five finish in the Big East, as sixth place Creighton already has nine losses with two games to play.\n\nFourth, Marquette is a heavy favorite in their final home game of the year because Xavier is bad. BartTorvik.com says Golden Eagles by 17, 69-52. Part of that is because Marquette beat Xavier 67-54 in Cincinnati on New Year’s Day, and the Golden Eagles did that without Skylar Forbes available. It took a 20/19/5/2 from Halle Vice, but Marquette pushed it across the finish line and led by double digits for the entire second half. The Musketeers have lost nine of their last 10, and their assorted metrics have been getting worse across their current five game losing streak.\n\nThere is zero reason why Marquette should lose this game. Everything points at reasons for Marquette to be motivated to 1) win on Senior Night, 2) win to lock up a bye to the quarterfinals, 3) win to snap their losing streak, and 4) beat a bad Xavier team.\n\nDate: Wednesday, February 25, 2026\nTime: 6:30pm Central\nLocation: Al McGuire Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nStreaming: ESPN+ with Bob Brainerd and Chloe Marotta calling the action\nLive Stats: Stat Broadcast\nBluesky Updates: @AnonymousEagle\n\nMarquette is 26-7 all time against Xavier. The series started back in 1985 and was pretty even through the first nine encounters. The Musketeers won three of the first five meetings between the two teams once XU joined the Big East, but the Golden Eagles have now won 19 straight in the series, after a shorthanded 67-54 win in Cincinnati on New Year’s Day.",

    "title": "Champions League Preview: Juventus vs. Galatasaray",
    "description": "Juventus face a monumental task of trying to reverse a 5-2 aggregate scoreline that was a lot of their own doing in Wednesday night’s second leg against Galatasaray.",
    "fullText": "When Juventus headed into the second leg of their Champions League play-off round tie against PSV Eindhoven last season, they had every chance to qualify for the Round of 16. All they needed to do was avert disaster and then they would be extending their European campaign by another 180 minutes at least.\n\nThe problem about what happened last week is that the disaster has already happened, not taken place in the second leg. It was the second half in which Juve completely self-destructed in Istanbul, seeing all the work they had done to get ahead 2-1 after falling behind early disappear faster than a trick by your favorite magician.\n\nSo now, with just about 99.9% of folks thinking that this tie is pretty much over, there’s a second leg to play.\n\nIt comes after another disappointing performance in the month of February, too.\n\nWe are about to see if Luciano Spalletti’s can muster up something that they didn’t over the weekend against Como: the ability to fight. We saw that fight against Inter Milan in the Derby d’Italia. We saw that fight in the first half in Istanbul as Teun Koopmeiners did the unexpected and scored a brace in a Juve shirt. But ever since everything went to hell and Galatasaray stormed back from a goal down to score four unanswered and take a 5-2 aggregate lead with them to Turin, Wednesday night’s second leg will be the chance to show that the fight still exists no matter what the final aggregate scoreline ends up being after the final whistle sounds.\n\nTo turn the tie in their favor may be too much to ask.\n\nHell, after Saturday’s showing against Como expecting a big response might be, too.\n\nBut at this point, there really is only one thing that Juventus know they can do: they can’t play like they have over the course of their last three halves of football. Or really much of the last month. Because if they repeat any of that, then their Champions League campaign will come to an end and it will be done in just as bad of a fashion as it possibly could. And on their home field.\n\nIf they come out fighting … yeah, they will still probably lose on aggregate because that’s just what happens when you allow four goals in a half and see your 2-1 lead go up in smoke.\n\nThis is a test of Juventus’ character as much as it is to see if they can just make things interesting against a Galatasaray side that also fell to a 2-0 loss over the weekend. Spalletti essentially said that during his pre-match press conference, including a call to the fans in the same stadium that booed the squad before, during and then after the loss to Como on Saturday.\n\n““Some games aren’t just played, but composed,” Spalletti said. “Tomorrow requires the involvement and participation of the whole environment, and we need the spirit of our fans. We know it’s a delicate situation, but we’re asking them to stand by our side tomorrow. With them by our side, we are stronger.”\n\nIt’s also going to be interesting to see how Galatasaray play it considering they will take the field with a three-goal aggregate lead and can still lose by two without being in any danger of advancing to face either Liverpool or Tottenham in the UCL Round of 16. Does Galatasaray manager Okan Buruk pretty much just set up shop and hunker down for much of the night to comfortably defend their lead? Or, knowing what they did in the second half of the first leg last week, come out with their offensive firepower that they will likely field up front and try and put the early nail in Juve’s coffin and make it even more impossible to flip the aggregate scoreline?\n\nEither way, the easy thing to say is that Juventus need to be much more like the team that rallied back from going down 1-0 early in Istanbul rather than the one that squandered that same 2-1 lead a few short minutes later. They will not only have to be just that kind of team, but one that’s even better. It will come at a time in which Spalletti is sh0rt-handed at the back — most notably without both of his natural left back options as well as potentially his best central defender after he came off the field injured last Tuesday.\n\nThe odds are slim that Juventus advance to the Champions League Round of 16. Very, very slim. But there’s one thing Juventus can do regardless of what the aggregate scoreline says: play like they don’t care what said scoreline is. They can play like they give a damn regardless if it’s 2-2 on aggregate or the reality of it being 5-2.\n\nPlay for the pride of the jersey. Play for the personal pride of not being booed off the field yet again.\n\nIf they do, then they can bow out with some modicum of pride. But if they don’t, then it’s looking like a winless February and even worse of an overall vibe surrounding them from the outside as they head to Rome in a few days.\n\nThanks to their respective variety of cards in last Tuesday’s first leg, Juventus will be without both Andrea Cambiaso and Juan Cabal for Wednesday night’s play-off round decider.\n\nThe big news out of Spalletti’s press conference on Tuesday: Bremer will be available and will be available against Galatasaray. The catch is that many of the predicted lineups on Tuesday don’t expect Bremer to be in the starting lineup on Wednesday. Considering what happened after he left late in the first half last week, this is a pretty good thing to actually have him available again.\n\nBremer’s final status for Galatasaray will be assessed Wednesday morning, according to Spalletti.\n\nSpalletti sounded a little more optimistic about Kenan Yildiz’s status to face Galatasaray, saying “He wants to be involved tomorrow at any cost, and today he trained partially with the group.” Spalletti added that Yildiz “could start from the first minute.”\n\nThe other injured players are the ones we know about already, with Dusan Vlahovic, Emil Holm and (or course) Arek Milik all missing out.\n\nThere is a growing feeling in the Italian media that Mattia Perin will start in goal for the struggling Michele Di Gregorio — which, considering what has happened in recent weeks, is completely understandable.\n\nJonathan David is expected to return to the starting lineup after missing the first leg in Turkiye last week.\n\nDespite the lack of fullback options, most predicted lineups has Spalletti going with a 4-3-3 formation.\n\nIf Spalletti does choose to go with a 3-4-2-1 because of limited options at the back, the existence of Filip Kostic will give the Tuscan tactician an actual wingback to have in the starting lineup. That’s right — Kostic in a crucial Champions League fixture in 2026. You didn’t expect that back in August, did ya?\n\nWith all of the absences in defense, this feels like one of those games in which Juventus’ ultimate wild card in terms of where he’s going to be playing is going to take on yet another interesting chapter.\n\nCould he be a left back if Spalletti goes into a back four? Does he play as a wingback opposite Kostic if Spalletti goes with a back three? Is it some kind of whacky hybrid kind of role that will be ever-evolving throughout his time on the field on Wednesday night?\n\nEither way, we know one thing: Weston McKennie will be on the field and battling like all hell.\n\nProbably around the time that Juventus players took the fields at Continassa for Tuesday’s training session ahead of their showdown with Galatasaray, we heard that McKennie was closing in on a contract extension with the Bianconeri. It is certainly a reward for the work that he’s put in this season, and certainly a cause for celebration no matter how much the current situation against Galatasaray is far from ideal.\n\nSo why McKennie here as compared somebody like say, David, who is likely leading the line against Gala? Well, because we’ve seen McKennie be really, really good in the Champions League during his entire career at Juventus and just because if he is in fact fielded as a wingback then that might be taking away form what has made him so good under Spalletti.\n\nWhat is one of the biggest things that McKennie has done so well the last few months playing in a more advanced role? It’s been his ability to run into space and then take advantage of it no matter if it’s setting up goals or getting himself free in the penalty area to score one for himself. It’s shown the versatility to his game — both positionally and when it comes to his skill set.\n\nBut is that the same kind of things that he can bring to the table when he’s playing as a wingback? To an extent, yes. Not to the same kind of degree when he’s playing further up the field behind the striker or out wide as a quasi-winger.\n\nThat makes him all the more important against Galatasaray — which, considering who could start on the opposite wing is that we know at least one wing is likely just going to spam in some crosses and not exactly be a creative force by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nWhen: Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026.\n\nWhere: Juventus Stadium, Turin, Italy.\n\nOfficial kickoff time: 9 p.m. local time in Italy and across Europe, 8 p.m. in the United Kingdom, 3 p.m. Eastern time, 2 p.m. Central time, 12 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nTelevision: CBS Sports Network (United States); TNT Sports 3, TNT Sports 5 (United Kingdom).\n\nOnline/Streaming: Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video USA, fuboTV (United States); DAZN Canada; fuboTV Canada (Canada); Amazon Prime Video UK (United Kingdom); Amazon Prime Video (Italy).\n\nOther live viewing options can be found here, and as always, you can also follow along with us live and all the stupid things we say on Bluesky.

To add to this, Bruno Fernandes’ future also remains up in the air.\n\nA pretty sizeable revamp is on the cards, with Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson the top priority to come in and strengthen the middle of the park.\n\nOne player will not be enough, and INEOS are likely to sign two midfielders. Carlos Baleba, and Adam Wharton remain genuine targets, but recently, another Forest ace got linked with a switch to Old Trafford.\n\nIbrahim Sangare would cost much less than both the Crystal Palace ace and Brighton and Hove Albion star, while he has impressed despite Forest’s current predicament.\n\nHowever, Fabrizio Romano has refuted the rumours, claiming there is no concrete interest in the Ivorian.\n\n“Manchester United have a crucial plan for the midfield in summer 2026.\n\n“They love Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest and there is nothing concrete in the links with Ibrahim Sangare.”\n\nThe Italian journalist also added that INEOS are locked in talks with Kobbie Mainoo’s camp over a new contract.\n\nThat is indeed great news after former head coach Ruben Amorim came dangerously close to selling the Carrington graduate in two successive windows.\n\nOn the pitch, the Red Devils stretched their unbeaten run under Michael Carrick to six games with a narrow 1-0 win away at Everton on Monday night.\n\nIt was far from a vintage display, but a breathtaking counter-attack finished off by Benjamin Sesko proved to be the difference between the two sides.\n\nThey return to action again on Sunday when Crystal Palace visit the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nFeature image Naomi Baker via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "Pacers coach Rick Carlisle calls out league on $100,000 tanking fine, league pushes back",
    "description": "Carlisle said the league didn't talk to him or the team physician about Aaron Nesmith missing time.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this month, the NBA fined the Indiana Pacers $100,000 for \"violating the Player Participation Policy in connection with the team's game against the Utah Jazz on Feb. 3.\" On the second night of a back-to-back, Indiana sat All-Star Pascal Siakam as well as Bennedict Mathurin (who was traded within days), T.J. McConnell, Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith for the game (a loss to the Jazz). The league said that, in consultation with an independent physician, it determined that Siakam and two others could have played, although possibly in reduced roles.\n\nPacers coach Rick Carlisle didn't hold back when addressing the fine during a radio appearance on 107.5 The Fan on Tuesday (hat tip The Athletic).\n\n\"I didn't agree with it. There was a league lawyer that was doing the interview that kind of unilaterally decided that Aaron Nesmith, who had been injured the night before and couldn't hold the ball, should have played in the game, which just seems ridiculous.\n\n\"During the interview process – I was not on it, but I heard details – we asked them if they wanted to talk to the doctors, our doctors, about it because it was something that was documented by our doctors and trainers. They said no, they didn't need to. They talked to their doctors, who did not examine Aaron Nesmith. And we asked them if they wanted to talk to (Nesmith), and they said, no, they didn't need to.\n\n\"This was shocking to me. And during the interview, they also asked if we considered medicating him to play in a game when we were 30 games under .500. So I was very surprised. Obviously didn't agree with it.\"\n\nAs you might expect, a league spokesman had a different spin on this when Sam Amick of The Athletic reached out.\n\n\"Coach Carlisle's description of the process that went into the decision to fine the Indiana Pacers is inaccurate. An independent physician led the medical review. In addition, the Pacers' general manager and the team's senior vice president (of) sports medicine and performance were interviewed as part of the process. The Pacers confirmed that it had provided all of the information requested by the league and the team reported that an interview with Coach Carlisle or a team physician wasn't necessary.\"\n\nFirst, what Carlise accurately sums up is the vibe around the NBA — the league's approach to limiting tanking is random. Scattershot. Utah and Indiana (and likely a couple of teams in the future) will be hit with fines, while other teams sit out stars — with what seems, from the outside, to be very slow-healing injuries (to be generous) — and go unpunished. I have no doubt that the league feels there is an internal logic and they are following the CBA, but outside the New York NBA HQ, the feeling is Utah in particular (because they played stars but sat them in the fourth quarter), but Indiana as well, were singled out for things a whole bunch of other teams are doing. Utah basically said, \"Okay, we'll play your game,\" and came up with surgeries for Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jusuf Nurkic that will sit two key rotation players for the remainder of the year.\n\nSecond, if the price for Indiana of a top-four pick is a $100,000 fine, they will pay it with a smile. That is the price of doing business. Utah will feel the same way about a $500,000 fine.",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A.J. Brown and Maxx Crosby are two of the best NFL players who could be on the move this offseason.\n\nTheir teams just aren’t saying they’re on the trade block.\n\nBrown, the Philadelphia Eagles’ star wide receiver, wasn’t happy with the offense or his role in it last season after helping the team win the Super Bowl in 2024. But the Eagles will have a new system with offensive coordinator Sean Mannion.\n\n“There’s a lot of conversations in the offseason about players on your team, on other teams,” Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Tuesday at the NFL scouting combine. “That’s really the job. That’s the fun part about the offseason is the opportunities to improve your team, the opportunities to make trades but at the end of the day, again, we’re trying to get better. It’s hard to do that if you’re just subtracting great players.\n\n“We’ll do whatever is in the best interest of our team to be better for this year and going forward. Anything that puts us in position that we think to potentially win another championship so every decision will be made with that no matter who the player is.”\n\nCrosby, the five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher for the Las Vegas Raiders, finished last season on injured reserve after being shut down for the final two weeks due to a knee injury, despite his desire to play. He’s said he wants to play for a contender.\n\nRaiders GM John Spytek said he anticipates Crosby being on the team and added he had a “great conversation” with him. He also pointed to the New England Patriots going from 4-13 in 2024 to playing in the Super Bowl in 2025 as an example of a team that can dramatically improve from one season to the next.\n\nHowever, when asked if Crosby is an “untradeable player,” Spytek said: “We’re always listening, man.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "In celebration of AJ Styles' in-ring career, legends and active wrestlers gathered for a special tribute in the closing segment of \"WWE Raw,\" with Styles himself getting choked up on the microphone. After \"Raw\" went off the air, several others did as well.\n\nAs seen in the near-five minute YouTube exclusive, a string of heartfelt moments unfolded in the ring as Styles said goodbye to colleagues from WWE, New Japan Pro-Wrestling, and TNA. Amongst those from Styles' TNA history were Frankie Kazarian, Drake Maverick (formerly known as Rockstar Spud), Bobby Roode, and Abyss, the former two of whom now serve as backstage producers for WWE. When embracing Roode, Styles remarked \"You got me good, dude,\" referencing his surprise at the news of his WWE Hall of Fame induction. Roode, however, admitted then that he had no prior knowledge of it.\n\nKarl Anderson and Luke Gallows, who worked with Styles across WWE and NJPW, were also present for the tribute show, marking their first WWE appearances after being released from the company in February 2025. Like them, Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, Finn Balor, and Cody Rhodes served as the night's former Bullet Club representatives. Balor and Styles even greeted each other with a Too Sweet.\n\nAmongst Styles' WWE family, Cathy Kelley, Stephanie Vaquer, Michin, and Asuka appeared visibly emotional. Before it all, Rhodes and Sami Zayn hoisted \"The Phenomenal One\" on their shoulders.\n\nStyles' last match took place at the 2026 Royal Rumble, where \"The Career Killer\" GUNTHER made him pass out to the sleeper hold. Prior to that, Styles notably met Shinsuke Nakamura, his former NJPW rival, in a match at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event. Equipped with his camera, Nakamura later took photos of Styles' sendoff on \"Raw\" as well.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

His latest post underlined that philosophy.\n\n“A strong core is the engine of a powerful golf swing,” he posted. “If you want balance, speed, and longevity in this game, you must train your center every day.”\n\nPlayer has consistently credited his longevity in the sport to disciplined training habits and an unwavering commitment to fitness. Even at 90, he continues to practise what he preaches.\n\nThe emphasis on core strength is particularly relevant in modern golf, where rotational power and stability are central to generating clubhead speed while avoiding injury.\n\nFitness is only part of the equation. Player also acknowledged how advances in golf technology have helped him maintain a high standard of play into his later years.\n\n“Technology in golf is incredible,” he added. “Hybrids have been an incredible development for golf and have certainly allowed me to maintain a high level of golf as I have gotten older. Absolutely loving my PXG hybrids.”\n\nHybrids have become a staple in many golfers’ bags thanks to their forgiveness and versatility, and Player is no exception. Rather than resisting modern equipment, he has embraced it.\n\nBetween his relentless dedication to fitness and his willingness to adapt to new technology, Player continues to set an example.\n\nAt 90, he remains one of golf’s most enduring ambassadors — and a reminder that longevity in the sport requires both hard work and evolution.\n\nWWE Superstar Trick Williams has brilliant response to Tom Brady’s ‘cute’ comments about wrestling\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown gets real about emotional NFL game in Germany with Detroit Lions\n\nNick Sirianni gives cryptic answer about A.J.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSoon, the Philadelphia Eagles will have some important decisions about several impending free agents, including tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nGoedert has been an integral part of Philadelphia’s offensive attack for years, and he even led the team in touchdown receptions in 2025 with 11. But, he’s headed for free agency, and it remains to be seen if the Eagles will bring him back.\n\nIf they don’t, perhaps they could look to identify a replacement early in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft, which is exactly what draft expert Mel Kiper has them doing in the first round of his latest mock draft for ESPN.\n\nIn the first round of his mock, Kiper has the Eagles selecting Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq with the 22nd overall pick.\n\nSadiq caught 51 passes for 560 yards and eight touchdowns for Oregon in 2025 and was named First-Team All-Big Ten and Big Ten Tight End of the Year.\n\n“If Philadelphia doesn't bring back free agent Dallas Goedert, it would be smart to draft a top-end replacement. Quarterback Jalen Hurts found Goedert for a team-high 11 receiving touchdowns last season, and he was the third-most-targeted pass catcher on the roster. In other words, Hurts likes throwing to his TE1,” Kiper wrote.\n\n“Sadiq had eight touchdown receptions last season, and he's explosive and does a lot of damage after the catch. NFC defenses would have a tough time matching up with him because of his speed and 6-foot-3, 245-pound size.”\n\nLane Johnson makes final decision regarding his future with Philadelphia Eagles\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles predicted to retain key contributor in free agency\n\nEagles urged to avoid former Pro Bowl cornerback in free agency",

    "fullText": "Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is reportedly sparing no expense for its unprecedented, one-of-one White House event this summer.\n\nAccording to Puck News, the promotion’s parent company, TKO Group Holdings, could spend “as much as $60 million” to stage the event tentatively scheduled for Fri., June 26, 2026, on the South Lawn. The event is being positioned as part of the United States’ 250th anniversary celebration — and the price tag reflects the scale.\n\nFor comparison, UFC 306 at Sphere in Las Vegas reportedly cost around $21 million to produce. The White House show could triple that figure. UFC CEO Dana White has already revealed that between $700,000 and $1 million alone may be required to replace the South Lawn grass after the event.\n\nPresident Donald Trump previously floated the idea of building a temporary stadium structure on-site to accommodate a massive crowd. However, Puck reports that those plans “are not remotely possible.”\n\nThe UFC head honcho has described a more controlled setup: approximately 3,000 to 4,000 invited guests cageside, with no public ticket sales, and a secondary viewing area at The Ellipse (President’s Park South), roughly a tenth of a mile away, where 85,000 fans could gather.\n\nRenderings of the proposed layout have already surfaced, suggesting the promotion is moving forward with its large-scale outdoor production.\n\nAs for the fight card, White recently said the lineup is already “built,” with two options mapped out with 6-7 fights. One notable omission: Conor McGregor is not expected to be involved.",

    "title": "Green Bay Packers: There’s Only One Reasonable Way Rashan Gary Can Come Back in 2026",
    "description": "Despite production questions, Brian Gutekunst surprisingly indicates that Rashan Gary is expected back with the Green Bay Packers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Green Bay Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst sat down with members of local media on Tuesday while at the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nHe touched on a variety of topics, including Rich Bisaccia's surprise decision to step down as special teams coordinator and assistant head coach. That was big news. The Packers were basically caught between a rock and a hard place by Bisaccia's resignation, and they didn't see it coming.\n\nAnother topic that's going to start making its way across Packer Nation like wildfire is Gutekunst's thoughts on pass-rusher Rashan Gary.\n\nGary has been tabbed as a shoo-in to be cut this offseason because of his drop in production, as well as the $18 million in base salary and $28 million cap hit he's going to represent in 2026.\n\nGary finished the season with just 7.5 sacks and he didn't notch a single sack over the last 10 games, including the playoffs.\n\nHe was a dissapointment both considering the money the Packers have paid him as well as his draft slot (No. 12 overall in 2019).\n\nWith that said, surprisingly, Gutekunst did speak about Gary as if the Packers are expecting him back in  2026.\n\n\"Sometimes, there is an ebb and flow with production with sacks,\" Gutekunst said, according to Zach Kruse of Packers Wire. \"He was impactful towards the second half of the season. Maybe not as much as the first, but he was impactful. Rashan has all the talent in the world. And he's produced at a high level for us since he's been here. We would expect that next year as well.\"\n\nGary has been with the Packers for seven seasons now. His high-water mark for sacks was 9.5 in 2021, but he's tallied just 7.5 sacks in each of the last two seasons, and he's averaged 6.64 sacks per season.\n\nThat's alright production from a role player or a mid-round pick, but it's abysmal production from a former first-round pick and a player who is expected to have the second-highest cap hit on the team next season behind only Jordan Love.\n\nThat's just not acceptable, and it's not sustainable, so if Gutekunst and the Packers are going to bring Gary back, you can almost guarantee they'll find a way out of that high cap number.\n\nThey could restructure Gary's deal by converting salary into a signing bonus, but that would still be paying him a ton of money despite the fact that he has not produced.\n\nThey could ask him to take a pay cut, which he wouldn't have to do, but it could keep him employed in Green Bay through the end of the 2027 season -- when his current deal ends.\n\nThe smartest move would be cutting Gary before June 1 and taking the nearly $11 million in savings. If they want him back in 2026, they could cut him and then re-sign him, though it's worth noting that at that juncture, he just may decide to try the open market.\n\nWith all that in mind, the only way forward that makes any sense here for the Packers is a pay cut. In fact, it's the only responsible and reasonable option, because Gary can't come back with a nearly $30 million cap hit next season.\n\nThis situation isn't ideal, but it's the mess that Gutekunst got himself in when he reached for a raw player with unrealized upside at No. 12 in the draft.\n\nPackersRoundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker has all but confirmed a big career change.\n\nWhittaker has been contemplating a light heavyweight move for a while now and is looking to make his divisional debut this summer. Whittaker is coming off back-to-back losses to current middleweight champion Khamzat Chimaev and Reinier de Ridder.\n\nWhile Whittaker (26-9 MMA, 17-7 UFC) never has missed weight as a welterweight and middleweight, he wonders if the cut could be hindering his performance.\n\n\"I'm locking in now,\" Whittaker told Submission Radio. \"I'm locking in for June. I want to get in there. I want to fight again. I want to fight in June at 205 most likely. I'm going to give it a go. I know a lot of naysayers, small this, small that. Shut up, dude. I want to give it a go. I'm on the tail end of my career, so I've got to try rather than just thinking about what ifs. ... I've been playing with the idea for a long time. During the break, I was kind of training at a heavier weight.\n\n\"I want to lock in and move in to this weight division. There's no doubt in my mind I could make middleweight. I can make it still. I can lose the weight, but I just don't know if it's like, if I'm getting the best out of myself, you know, having to cut that weight because the camp performance kind of really suffers on the backend of a weight cut, and a lot of fighters can testify that. I don't know. Try something different. It's my life.\"\n\nWhittaker revealed that his walk-around weight is over light heavyweight.\n\n\"I'm going to try and put on a little bit of muscle, but I'm not going to put too much,\" Whittaker said. \"I walk around heavy anyway. I'm heavy. I walk around like 107, 108 (kilos), just cruising. Obviously that's not shredded, so I want to try and bring that back, shred up, just train fed, train fully fueled, and get the most out of my camps, and come into fight week feeling good for once.\"\\\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC's Robert Whittaker locking in toward light heavyweight move",

    "fullText": "Chicago Cubs All-Star Pete Crow-Armstrong shaded Los Angeles Dodgers fans in an interview with Chicago Magazine.\n\nCrow-Armstrong — who broke out as a star for the Cubs in 2025 — grew up in the Los Angeles area, going to Harvard-Westlake School. The star praised fans in Chicago, but in doing so chose to take a shot at Dodgers fans.\n\n“I love Chicago more and more. It’s just an incredible city. The people are great,” he said. “They give a s—. They aren’t just baseball fans who go to the game like Dodgers fans to take pictures or whatever. They are paying attention. They care.”\n\nWhile he’s from the area, Crow-Armstrong is far from a Dodger fan. His dad grew up in Illinois and forbid him from rooting for either the Dodgers or the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n“Growing up in L.A., my dad gave me a couple of rules. 1) I couldn’t root for the Dodgers. 2) I couldn’t root for the Cardinals,” PCA wrote in The Players’ Tribune last year.\n\nWhile Crow-Armstrong speculates Dodger fans don’t care, they ultimately have bragging rights as the current holders of the World Series.\n\nPCA and the Cubs will look to establish themselves as serious contenders in the coming season, though, and they’ll get an early shot at the Dodgers during the regular season. L.A. hosts the Cubs from April 24-26, and LA Sports Report’s Doug McKain believes the Dodgers will show the All-Star just how much they “give a sh*t.”\n\nThe post Cubs All-Star Takes Shot at Dodger Fans appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "Bodo/Glimt just keep on defying the odds.\n\nThe Norwegian team, based around 200 miles into the Arctic Circle, have forged a reputation for upsets, but on Tuesday night in Milan they produced one of the biggest in Champions League history.\n\nFacing three-time winners Inter Milan - beaten by Paris St-Germain in the final of this competition just over nine months ago - Bodo had a daunting task, even if they held a 3-1 lead from the first leg.\n\nYet they rose to the occasion once more - just like they had done in beating Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in the group phase.\n\nIt was another resolute and determined display in Italy to complete a home and away double over Cristian Chivu's men, first to repel the numerous first-half Inter attacks before scoring twice to ultimately leave the Serie A leaders with too much to do.\n\nWinners 2-1 on the night, Bodo's 5-2 aggregate success secured their place in the Champions League last 16 for the first time, where they will face either Manchester City or Sporting.\n\n\"It is a historical moment for Bodo and I think also for Norwegian football,\" said boss Kjetil Knutsen.\n\nJens Petter Hauge was again inspirational, scoring his sixth goal in the competition this season for the opener, before setting up Hakon Evjen's lovely finish for the second.\n\n\"It sounds not true, but we are there, among the last teams in the competition,\" added the forward, who was back in the San Siro where he had a two-year spell at AC Milan.\n\n\"It will be really exciting to see what the next two games bring.\"\n\nBodo/Glimt stun Inter in Milan to reach last 16\n\nBodo/Glimt are the first Norwegian side to progress in a knockout-stage tie in the Champions League and the first overall in the European Cup since Lillestrom in the first round in 1987-88.\n\nThe Norwegians are the first team from outside of Europe's big five leagues to win four consecutive games in a European Cup/Champions League campaign against opponents from those leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy & France) since Ajax in 1971-72, who went on to win the European Cup that season.\n\nJens Petter Hauge has scored six goals for Bodo/Glimt in the Champions League this season; the most ever by a Norwegian player for a Norwegian club in a single edition of the European Cup/Champions League.\n\nThis fairytale run to the knockouts will have felt unlikely for Bodo after failing to win their first six league phase games, meaning they were left needing results against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid to qualify for the play-offs.\n\nAnd, against the odds, they provided them.\n\nA 3-1 victory over Pep Guardiola's men brought deserved attention and acclaim, but it was no one-off as Bodo overcame Atleti 2-1 in Madrid to claim a play-off spot.\n\nKnutsen's side lost to Spurs in the Europa League semi-finals last season, having become the first Norwegian side to reach the last four of a major European competition.\n\nKey to their success has often been their ability to make their home games as tough as possible.\n\nIn the north of Norway, Bodo can often be bitterly cold, snowy and windy during the long winter months, with temperatures deep into minus figures.\n\nThe difficult weather conditions mean the team play on an artificial pitch made of plastic, something many sides used to playing on grass find difficult to deal with.\n\nThose aspects, coupled with the players' determination and strong belief in their ability, means many have left Bodo defeated.\n\nThey famously thrashed Jose Mourinho's Roma 6-1 at home in the Europa Conference League five years ago, while Celtic, Besiktas, Porto and Lazio have also been victims in recent years.\n\nManchester City won't relish another meeting in the last 16 if they are drawn together, with Bodo buoyant after proving they have nothing to fear against Europe's top sides.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" captain Patrick Berg told Canal+.\n\n\"For the club and city it's unbelievable. I don't think people thought we could beat Manchester City, Atletico and now Inter two times.\n\nThis is a step into the unknown for Bodo as they prepare to play in the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time.\n\nBut their run to the Europa League semis in the previous campaign will give them belief - and provide hope to every small club of what can still be achieved in Uefa's major competitions.\n\nAnd, for however long this journey continues, they will be backed by the now familiar sight of their vocal fans, who were unmissable at the San Siro decked out all in yellow and with scarves held in the air.\n\n\"I am so proud, we are a team from a small town,\" added Knutsen.\n\n\"I really hope we show if we can do it, then everyone can do it. For me that's the most beautiful thing of the whole story.\"",

    "fullText": "Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney four-star quarterback Davin Davidson has quickly become one of the most coveted signal-callers in the 2027 cycle.\n\nAfter stacking myriad big-time offers over just a couple of months, Davidson has officially trimmed his list of top schools down to eight. He told Rivals’ Hayes Fawcett on Tuesday that he’s down to Auburn, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Miami, Mississippi State, Notre Dame and Virginia Tech.\n\nDavidson is the No. 208 overall prospect and No. 19 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 21 recruit in Florida.\n\nOn Monday, Davidson made a move up the Rivals300. He’s now the No. 120 recruit and No. 11 QB in Rivals’ 2027 rankings.\n\nThis week, Davidson updated his recruitment with Rivals’ Chad Simmons. His top schools are no surprise. A decision for the blue-chipper could come sooner rather than later, too.\n\n“In a perfect world, I’d take these spring visits and commit shortly after, then take one official,” Davidson told Simmons. “If it needs to go longer, I’ll take as many officials as I need. On these visits, I want to see if I’m truly a priority, how they treat me and how the relationships feel. Ultimately, I want to know if it feels like home.”\n\nAt the end of January, Davidson was in Gainesville. Florida, led by new head coach Jon Sumrall, has made an impression on the rising gunslinger.\n\n“I like Florida a lot,” Davidson said. “The new staff has been great and they’ve poured a lot into me. I’ve been there so much that I feel like I really know the program. The energy they bring and their focus on winning stand out. I like the strong culture at Florida.”\n\nIt remains to be seen who will come out on top for Davidson, but things are moving fast for the four-star. Upcoming visits will be crucial.\n\nRivals’ Director of Scouting and Rankings Charles Power recently wrote this of Davidson as a prospect:\n\n“Davin Davidson is another physically-talented 2027 passer who has seen his profile rise coming out of his junior season, as he helped Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney to a state title. Davidson pairs immense size at around 6-foot-6, 215 pounds with a very live arm. He’s more of a fastball thrower right now and will need to continue adding nuance as a passer. The size, arm, and movement skills are very projectable and his physical upside has created a considerable buzz. Davidson visited Florida for a junior day in January and has landed offers from the Gators, Florida State, Miami, and several others over the last month.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby has been a huge talking point of the offseason, and we bet that it won't stop anytime soon.\n\nWith Crosby reportedly disgruntled, there are some who think teams like the Dallas Cowboys could swoop in for the star pass rusher and lure him out of the AFC West.\n\nBut we know that players like Maxx don't come around too often, which makes a trade tough, but not impossible, with the franchise rumored to be wanting a Micah Parsons-like compensation of two first-round picks and a player.\n\nBut Raiders general manager John Spytek, in speaking at the scouting combine, might have just ended all of the trade speculation.\n\n\"Maxx is an elite player and I'm been very upfront that we're in the business of having really good players on the team, and we need a lot more of them,\" Spytek said via CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. \"It's hard to build a great team without elite players.\"\n\nMore: Steelers make eye-opening statement on potential Aaron Rodgers return\n\nIn truth, Spytek can say all he wants about wanting Crosby to stay, but if a godfather-like offer comes in and Maxx isn't 100 percent sold on staying, then the franchise will be hard-pressed to say no.\n\nSpytek is right, you can't build a great team without elite players, but as we know in the NFL, everything has a price, and for Crosby, it would be high.\n\nStill, we know several teams are willing to take a flyer on Maxx, despite Spytek's comments.\n\nAnd until this situation is resolved one way or another, Crosby and those trade talks will be the main headline of the offseason.\n\nWhy Chiefs are in ideal place to deal with big Travis Kelce decision\n\nBrett Veach's latest Chiefs quote should terrify the NFL\n\nTexans GM Nick Caserio goes scorched earth on C.J.

    "fullText": "One of the biggest talking points of the 2025 season was that the Minnesota Vikings, who had just gone 14-3 with Sam Darnold at the helm in 2024, decided to release the now-Super Bowl champion in favor of a questionable prospect, J.J. McCarthy. At the time, however, it seemed like a no-brainer for the Vikings.\n\nDarnold’s performance against the Los Angeles Rams in the Wild Card round was abysmal. When you pair that with the high-end draft capital that the front office had just invested in McCarthy not even a year prior, it seemed like the right decision to make. Unfortunately, the Michigan product has yet to justify both his first-round draft status and the Vikings’ decision to release Darnold.\n\n“I understand their thought process of going with the younger kid,” Darnold noted in a recent interview with Colin Cowherd. “There’s a lot of potential there, and I think J.J. is going to be a really, really good player in this league… That was a little bit of a tough pill to swallow, but when I really stood back and looked at it from afar, I really understood the decision, and I’m thankful that I landed in Seattle,” Sam said, justifying the move.\n\nSuffice to say, you won’t find any sour grapes here with Darnold, as he’s likely more aware than anyone else of the amount of egg that was left on the face of Minnesota all throughout his turnover-less playoff run. Throw in the early struggles of McCarthy, which included an 11:12 touchdown-to-interception ratio and a pass completion percentage of just 57.6%, and it seems fair to suggest that Darnold knows that there’s no need to kick a man while he’s down.\n\nAs far as his personal transition from Minnesota to the Seattle Seahawks is concerned, the 28-year-old explained that it’s a lot easier to do your job as a quarterback when you’re throwing to a player like Jaxson Smith-Njigba, who can only be described as a phenom at this point in his career. “From the start of OTAs, he was special,” Darnold remarked.\n\n“I remember we came out to L.A. in the offseason and we did some throwing with the guys right before training camp, and I had kind of seen him move around for the last couple months… One of my other buddies came to throw with us just because I needed an extra arm, and he was like ‘Dude, this guy is different,‘” Sam observed.\n\nThe 2025 Offensive Player of the Year played a critical role in Seattle’s path towards the championship, and now that we’ve seen what they are capable of, both he and Darnold figure to be at the forefront of every conversation that involves the NFC for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe post Seahawks’ Sam Darnold Explains Why Vikings’ Decision to Prioritize J.J.

    "description": "Trump wasn't willing to honor the U.S. women's team, but Jack Hughes can make sure their accomplishment isn't forgotten.",
    "fullText": "Jack Hughes has an opportunity for another gold-medal-worthy moment, and this time, he won’t have to beat a world-class goaltender to make it happen.\n\nThe Devils star only needs to use his massive platform as the new face of American hockey to make sure the other U.S. Olympic champions in his sport aren’t forgotten for what they accomplished in Milan.\n\nHe needs to do what President Donald Trump couldn’t do, inexplicably, with his callous dismissal of the U.S. women’s team during a locker room phone call as the men celebrated their historic victory over Canada. Trump made a dumb joke about needing to invite the women to the White House for the State of the Union address, too, as if they deserved that honor less than the men.\n\n“I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that,” Trump told the men’s team before adding that if he didn’t, “I do believe I probably would be impeached.”\n\nSeveral men gathered around the phone laughed, and while that sparked outrage, it feels unfair to hold that against them. This was a joyous atmosphere just moments after the signature victory of their careers. Let’s give them some grace for that initial reaction.\n\nWhat happens now, though, is on them. The U.S. women — surprise! — turned down Trump’s half-hearted invitation to the State of the Union address, while Hughes and 19 of his teammates were expected to be in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday night for the speech.\n\n“No matter what your views are, we’re super excited to go to the White House tomorrow and be a part of that,” Hughes told The Daily Mail.\n\nThat sentiment sounds nice, but in these divided times, it falls flat. From the moment the players invited FBI director Kash Patel into the locker room to awkwardly chug a beer as if he himself had scored the winning goal, the gold-medal moment went from a unifying time to something else that we can yell at each other about on social media. That’s just the reality of the world we’re living in now.\n\nOn one point, though, there should be universal agreement: The U.S. women’s team deserves as much attention and credit for their gold-medal victory over Canada as the men do. Hughes, whose mother, Ellen, is a player development consultant for the women’s team, should make sure he never misses an opportunity to talk about them in the same breath as he does his own team’s accomplishment.\n\nThis should come naturally. Hughes was asked in the chaos of his team’s overtime victory what his first thought was after he sent the puck past Canadian goaltender Jordan Binnington. He didn’t talk about how this goal would ensure his immortality in U.S. hockey, or how the next generation of American kids might be emulating him in their driveways or ice rinks.\n\n“Honestly, first thought was, ‘We just won. How do I get my gloves and helmet off?’” Hughes said. “And surprisingly enough, one of the first people I thought of was Megan Keller, who had the gold-medal goal the other night.”\n\nKeller isn’t some stranger. The players on the two U.S. teams became friendly in the athletes’ village, with Hughes and his brother, Quinn, in a group of men’s team players who attended the women’s gold-medal game. The two teams hung out in the cafeteria after their Closing Ceremony, packing their bags and reminiscing.\n\n“If you could see what we see from the inside, and the men and women sharing, you know, dorm rooms and halls and flex floors and the camaraderie and the synergy and the way the women cheered on the men and the way the men cheered on the women — that’s what it’s all about,\" Ellen Hughes told the Today Show. “And the other things they cannot control. They care about humanity. They care about unity and they care about the country.”\n\nClearly, Ellen Hughes has raised her kids the right way. In 2023, Jack voiced his unequivocal support for the Devils’ decision to hold a Pride Night when other teams were canceling their celebrations. The LGBTQ community cheered when Hughes declared, “There was never a thought to not do it.”\n\nHe can own this fraught moment in a similar fashion. That doesn’t mean challenging Trump or angering either side of the political divide. It means doing the right thing and using his platform to remind this country — and, yes, the president himself — that we have the two greatest hockey teams in the world.",

    "description": "Bengals director of personnel Duke Tobin weighs in on if the Bengals would be willing to make a trade for Raiders All-Pro Maxx Crosby.",
    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS – Former Cincinnati Bengals offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth set the NFL rumor mill on fire when he proposed a mega trade proposal for his former team ahead of the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\n“Go get Maxx Crosby at all costs,\" Whitworth said on his “Fitz and Whit” podcast when discussing what the Bengals should do this offseason.\n\nFor the Bengals to acquire a player of Crosby’s caliber, they would need to be ready to take a big swing like giving up a future first-round pick and taking another major contract on the books.\n\nMore: Where Bengals stand with Trey Hendrickson at NFL combine\n\nSo, is Cincinnati willing to make a bold move like that?\n\nBengals fans shouldn’t get their hopes up as it seems unrealistic at this point. Here’s what the Bengals’ director of personnel Duke Tobin had to say on the subject.\n\n“We're always looking if there's an opportunity that we feel warrants it,” Tobin said on Feb. 24. “You have to give up things, and when you take a big swing, there's a big chance you miss. And it can stay with you for a long time and keep you in the dugout, if we're staying with baseball. We don't want to stay in the dugout. That's not a place we want to be.\n\n\"You don't get to take a big swing for free. Big swings take big compensation.”\n\nThe Bengals say they’ve proven they are all in with other decisions i.e. paying top dollar for wide receivers Tee Higgins and Ja’Marr Chase last season and making a rare in-season trade for Joe Flacco.\n\nCincinnati puts a premium on draft picks. Bengals owner Mike Brown and Tobin strongly believe in building through the draft, and giving up a first-round pick isn’t something they do often.\n\n“It's got to be worth it… we don't ignore opportunities that are out there,” Tobin said. “There are a lot of opportunities out there, and I think the offseason is the time to build your football team from the ground up. And that's what we're gonna try to do this offseason.”\n\nYou can never say never in the NFL. Crazy things happen all the time.\n\nTobin’s response makes it hard to believe the Bengals would be inclined to give up a first-round pick or make a splash move the likes of which fans are clamoring for.\n\nTobin believes given the cap space they have available this year and owning the No. 10 draft pick, they can get back to being a contender in 2026. Cincinnati ranks No. 7 in the NFL in most cap space available with $53 million.\n\n“We're excited about attacking this offseason,” Tobin said. “We have resources to attack the offseason in a big way, and we want to do that.”\n\nIt’s exactly what they’ll try to do, starting with an important week in Indianapolis. The Bengals must hit on their free agency signings and draft more players who can make an impact right away.\n\nThey believe they can achieve all of that without mortgaging their future.\n\n“We're trying to put the best roster together every year, and this year is no different,” Tobin said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Maxx Crosby trade rumors at 2026 NFL Scouting Combine for Bengals",

    "fullText": "Tyler Black went 3 for 3 with a home run and six runs batted in to power the Brewers to their first Cactus League victory, a 10-0 shutout of the Athletics at Hohokam Stadium in Mesa, Arizona, on Tuesday, Feb. 24.\n\nBlack hit a two-run blast in the first, a bases-clearing single and capped his day with a run-scoring double in the fifth. He also stole a base.\n\nThe three-run single was a statistical oddity, with only two such cases occurring in the major leagues last season.\n\n\"I decided to throw on the parachute there,\" said Black, noting the presence of A's center-field whiz Denzel Clarke.\n\nAmong the four pitchers in major league camp to see action was right-hander Coleman Crow, who allowed a single and hit a batter but came back with a strikeout and then finished the fifth by inducing a groundout.\n\nCrow was added to the Brewers' 40-man roster in the offseason and after starting for the entirety of his minor league career could factor in as a long relief option in the bullpen at some point in 2026.\n\n– Brice Turang worked a 14-pitch walk in the third inning from Mason Barnett. He fouled off nine pitches total, including four straight and seven of eight during one stretch.\n\n– David Hamilton and Akil Baddoo both experienced some buzzard's luck after crushing balls to straightaway center field that hit off the batter's eye and dropped back into the field of play for doubles, which goes according to the ground rules at Hohokam Stadium.\n\nHamilton's shot (425 feet) would have been a homer in 28 of 30 major league ballparks while Baddoo's (434) would have gone out of all 30.\n\n– It's spring training for everyone, apparently, as the headshot on the scoreboard throughout the entirety of the game for Blake Perkins was actually that of former Brewers right-hander Freddy Peralta.\n\n— Todd Rosiak (@Todd_Rosiak) February 24, 2026\n\n\"That's something to work with, huh?\" manager Pat Murphy on 6-foot-3, 250-pound Wande Torres, a left-hander who threw a scoreless seventh inning against the San Diego Padres on Feb. 23. The 21-year-old was 1-10 last season at Class A Carolina but averaged a strikeout an inning and was reaching 97 mph against the Padres.\n\nLuke Adams, starting at third base, had moments both in the field and at the plate. He opened the bottom of the second by playing a slow chopper by Jacob Wilson, gloving the ball on a tough short hop and then firing an on-target throw on the move to first base for the out.\n\nThen in the fifth, Adams rifled a run-scoring triple down the right-field line. He also walked in his second plate appearance.\n\n\"He's a good baseball player,\" Murphy said. \"You can't play third unless you can make that play.

    "fullText": "Italian football stands on the brink of a Champions League \"debacle\" - with the prospect of no Serie A clubs competing in this season's last 16.\n\nSince the reintroduction of the last-16 knockout round to Europe's showpiece competition in 2003-04, there has always been at least one Italian representative - on 12 occasions in the past 22 years, there have been three.\n\nIn fact, there has been at least one Italian side in the last 16 of the competition - or first knockout round when it took other formats - every year since 1987-88, when Napoli went out in the first round of the European Cup to Real Madrid.\n\nBut Inter Milan's shock play-off exit to Norwegian debutants Bodo/Glimt on Tuesday means either Juventus or Atalanta will have to overcome first-leg deficits to keep that run going.\n\nJuventus trail Galatasaray 5-2 heading into a return meeting in Turin, while Atalanta are 2-0 down on aggregate before Wednesday's home leg with Borussia Dortmund.\n\nInter - finalists last season - lost 2-1 at San Siro against Bodo, having suffered a 3-1 defeat in the first leg.\n\nIt is the first time the Milan giants have been knocked out of the Champions League by a team from outside Europe's top five leagues, those from England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France.\n\n\"This is a big wake up for Italian football,\" said Italian football journalist Daniele Verri.\n\n\"Juventus will need to win 4-0 and Atalanta need to win 3-0. [For them all to go out] would be a complete debacle, a disaster for our clubs.\n\n\"Tonight Ronaldo and Christian Vieri were guests at San Siro, and this is a symbolic clash with what has been and what is.\"\n\nInter signed Ronaldo and Vieri for world-record fees in the late 1990s, when Serie A was the envy of world football, blessed with the game's most talented stars.\n\nAC Milan then beat Juventus to win the Champions League in 2003, losing to Liverpool on penalties in the final two years later, before defeating the Reds to become European champions again in 2007.\n\nWhile there have been more recent successes in Europe's other competitions - Atalanta won the Europa League in 2024, Roma won the Conference League in 2021 - Jose Mourinho's Inter were the last Italian side to win the Champions League in 2010.\n\nInter's European exit comes despite being 10 points clear of rivals AC Milan in Serie A and a further four ahead of defending champions Napoli, who failed to make it out of the Champions League's league phase.\n\n\"It is a piece of history,\" said journalist Vincenzo Credendino. \"Speaking about Italy and Inter, this is one of the worst pieces.\n\n\"Inter are the best in Italy, but maybe it is time to think not about what can happen in one or two years, but about 10 or 15 years - and on that side we can see generally Italian football is not on the same level of top European leagues.\"\n\nThe national team must also win through a play-off in March to avoid missing out on a third successive World Cup this summer, having last lifted the trophy in 2006.\n\n\"It is a difficult time for Italian football and this shows it,\" added European football expert Julien Laurens on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"Today, Inter Milan put pressure on but it was not enough from them. They have been the best team in Italy for the last few years. And Napoli as well, they haven't even come close.\n\n\"It's terrible for Italian football at the moment.\"\n\nInter won five of their opening eight league phase games in Europe to finish 10th, with Juventus 13th and Atalanta 15th.\n\nYet in the play-offs, all have come unstuck against sides who finished lower in the table but play a more intense brand of football.\n\n\"What does it say about Italian football? That something needs to be changed,\" added Verri.\n\n\"The level of Italian football is poor. It is a structural issue. We play very slow football. You can ask any manager in Italy and they will all say the same.\n\n\"I was talking to Claudio Ranieri the other day and he said: 'Look, when I was in England at Leicester... people don't train more than in Italy. They just do it with another intensity, and then they keep up that intensity during the games.'\n\n\"We play slow, and in Europe you suffer.\"\n\n'We really messed up' - does European football need more balance?\n\nWhile Inter boast a much more expensively assembled squad on far bigger wages than Bodo, who had nine Norwegians in their starting XI at San Siro, Verri says Italian clubs are seeing their best players move abroad.\n\nLast season's Serie A top goalscorer Mateo Retegui left for Al-Qadsiah in Saudi Arabia, for example, while former team-mate Ademola Lookman joined Atletico Madrid and Tijjani Reijnders left AC Milan for Manchester City.\n\nWhile the majority of Italy's national squad still play in the country, stars such as Gianluigi Donnarumma, Riccardo Calafiori, Sandro Tonali and Retegui are elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, Laurens believes Serie A clubs are no longer producing good enough youngsters.\n\n\"Sporting CP, Club Brugge and Bodo have similarities in their success this season. Their scouting is great and their academies perform well,\" he explained.\n\n\"The academies in Italy are not producing enough players or players who are fit to play in their first team. The way they spend their money is not what we are used to from Italian clubs.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "description": "\"The battle of the mind can be dark and hard and unrelenting,” the Olympic athlete said",
    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn speaks candidly about her mental and physical recovery\n\nThe professional athlete suffered a horrific injury while skiing at the 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nShe required a medical airlift and five surgeries, and is now expected to be in a wheelchair for the next two months\n\nLindsey Vonn is beginning to process the severity of her injury at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, Feb. 24, the alpine ski racer, 41, admitted, “Today was a hard day.”\n\n“My physical battle began the second I got hurt but the mental battle started today,\" Vonn wrote. \"It hit me like a ton of bricks. It’s a battle I’m used to because I’ve done it so many times. I have always learned from every injury. Each one has made me a better and stronger person in different ways… but the battle of the mind can be dark and hard and unrelenting.\"\n\nThe athlete — who won four World Cup overall championships with titles in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012 — added that someone close to her likened her to a “master at the psychological game of life…”\n\n“I don’t know if that’s true…. I do know hard days are coming but I will find a way back to the top of the mountain of life,” she concluded.\n\nOn Feb. 8, just 13 seconds into her run in the women’s downhill event during the Milan Cortina Games, Vonn suffered a horrifying crash one week after tearing her ACL.\n\nAfter approximately 15 minutes of medical staff tending to the skier, she was placed on a stability board before being airlifted by helicopter to a hospital.\n\n\"Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would,\" Vonn said, breaking her silence on social media the following day. \"It wasn’t a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\"\n\nElsewhere in her lengthy Feb. 9 Instagram post, the Olympian said her \"ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever,\" adding that she \"sustained a complex tibia fracture\" that would “require multiple surgeries to fix properly.\"\n\nLast week, following her fifth surgery, Vonn confessed that she was “struggling a bit” due to “the extent of the trauma.”\n\nIn keeping with her promise to keep her fans updated on her recovery, on Monday, Feb. 23, she said the crash was so bad that it almost resulted in her leg being amputated.\n\n\"After two weeks, I finally made it out of the hospital. It has been quite the journey and by far the most extreme and painful and challenging injury I've ever faced in my entire life times one hundred. I'll give you the full rundown,\" Vonn said in her Instagram video.\n\nShe added that because of her complex tibia fracture, in which “everything was in pieces,\" including her \"muscles, nerves and tendons,” extreme measures needed to be taken.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n\"Dr. Tom Hackett saved my leg. He saved my leg from being amputated,\" she said, becoming emotional.\n\nVonn, who won a gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games in the women's downhill event, is expected to be in a wheelchair for the next couple of months as she recovers. However, she ended her video on a positive note.\n\n\"It's going to be a long road, but I always fight,\" she said. \"I'll keep going. No regrets. I just appreciate all the love and support. It's been amazing. Overwhelming to an extent. I wish it had ended differently, really, but I'd rather go down swinging than not trying at all.\"",

    "fullText": "Closed mouths don't get fed. Shoot for the moon, even if you miss you'll be amongst the stars. Whatever your favorite saying may be, apply it to contract negotiations in the NFL. On Tuesday, it was revealed that Cowboys restricted free agent Brandon Aubrey, the best kicker in the league, is looking to reset the kicker market in a major way.\n\nNot only is he looking to surpass the average salary of the current highest-paid kicker. That's certainly to be expected and is the basis for Cowboys Wire's prediction of a four-year extension for Aubrey. However word emerged on Tuesday that he doesn't just plan to surpass the $6.4 million per-year ceiling established by Kansas City's Harrison Butker, but obliterate it.\n\nDallas Morning News' Calvin Watkins is reporting that Aubrey turned down the club's $7.5 million a year offer is seeking a $10 million per year salary.\n\nThe Cowboys offered Aubrey the largest contract for a kicker in NFL history, according to a person with knowledge of the talks.\n\nAubrey, a restricted free agent, was offered a deal with an average salary of close to $7.5 million but is looking for nearly $10 million per season.\n\nAubrey is represented by Todd France, the agent who got Dak Prescott $5 million more a season than Joe Burrow was making atop the QB totem pole.\n\nFortunately for the Cowboys, they don't have to acquiesce. As Aubrey is a restricted free agent, the Cowboys have a lot of control over the situation, though not total.\n\nDallas will be given the opportunity to place one of two (three actually, but the third is unrealistic) tenders on Aubrey that would guarantee him a one-year salary. Aubrey would still be able to shop for a deal elsewhere, but if he signed an offer sheet with another team, the Cowboys would be allowed to match the offer.\n\nIf Dallas refused to match, the acquiring club would have to send the Cowboys either a first or second-round pick, depending on the amount of the Cowboys' tender.\n\nIf Dallas offered Aubrey a $5.8 million tender for 2026, an acquiring team would have to send the Cowboys a second-round pick. If Dallas offered Aubrey an $8.1 million tender, the acquiring team would have to send the Cowboys a first-round pick.\n\nIn many situations, where a tender is placed but the player doesn't want to return, a trade for slightly less compensation is often worked out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Cowboys FA Aubrey looking to make kicker a 7-figure salary position",

    "description": "The LA Galaxy return to Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday to face Panamanian club Sporting San Miguelito in the second leg of the opening round of Concacaf Champions Cup.",
    "fullText": "After a frustrating draw with NYCFC that felt more like a loss Sunday, the LA Galaxy are back in action at Dignity Health Sports Park on Wednesday night. This time, for the second leg of their Concacaf Champions Cup opening round against Sporting San Miguelito.\n\nAfter the first leg, LA hold the advantage, last week's 1-1 draw in Panama means a win, or any scoreless draw, sends the Galaxy through to the round of 16, where Jamaican club Mt. Pleasant, the 2025 Caribbean Cup champion, awaits.\n\nIn Concacaf Champions Cup play, the away goals rule acts as the primary tiebreaker for two-legged knockout rounds (Round One through Semifinals). If the aggregate score is tied after two legs, the team with more away goals advances. If away goals are also equal, the tie goes directly to penalties.\n\nBut as head coach Greg Vanney made clear, the away goal conceded in the first leg makes this a precarious lead.\n\n“I think it's really up to them. It's a catch-22,” Vanney said of San Miguelito’s approach. “Ninety minutes is a long time, so I don't think you necessarily have to come out flying... It's really up to us to have the solution to whichever way they come.”\n\nFor a Galaxy side still trying to find its rhythm, that unpredictability is the central challenge. The team returned from Panama and looked sharp early against NYCFC, with new striker João Klauss scoring inside two minutes. But as Vanney noted, that sharpness faded.\n\nYour @LARiotSquad Player of the Match, João Klauss ⭐️ pic.twitter.com/2uKGPBkqbA\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 24, 2026\n\n“We haven't had two back-to-back training sessions in a row since somewhere in Coachella,” Vanney explained. “We're actually trying to evolve a little bit inside of these games and solve some different looks.”\n\nThe \"look\" in Panama was a disciplined, bunkered approach from San Miguelito that the Galaxy couldn't fully break down, surrendering a goal that gave the visitors a precious away tally.\n\nThe \"look\" against NYCFC was a high press that the Galaxy solved early, only to stall after going down to ten men following a lengthy VAR review. The result was another draw, leaving the Galaxy with more questions than answers.\n\nNext up: @TheChampions at home on wednesday ⏭️ pic.twitter.com/aUmWrPJrLN\n\n— LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) February 23, 2026\n\n“We got off to a great start, and we just didn't deal with the ball well. I thought we defended really well for large stretches,” Vanney reflected on the NYCFC match. “We're evolving, and tomorrow is another opportunity to take a step.”\n\nThat step will require the Galaxy to dictate the tempo against a San Miguelito team that now has a clear objective: find a goal and hunker down defensively.\n\nVanney believes these dense, high-stakes fixtures are the perfect classroom for his squad.\n\n“What's beautiful about these moments is the team is facing different challenges,” he said. “Playing against a low block in Panama, your team has to change its mentality because they have to add speed into the game with the ball... These are great opportunities for our guys that are going to build a solid foundation.”\n\nThe Galaxy's midfield is slowly getting replenished, Vanney told reporters Isaiah Parente and Elijah Wynder are progressing and could be \"part of the group\" on Wednesday. He added Erik Thommy could make his debut Saturday against Charlotte and defender Chris Rindov was \"a little further behind\"\n\nKickoff is set for 8:30 p.m. from Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nLocation: Dignity Health Sports Park, Carson, Calif.\n\nRadio: LA Galaxy Youtube Channel.",

    "fullText": "The NFL has revealed that one of the more controversial calls from the Pittsburgh Steelers' 2025 season — Aaron Rodgers' near-interception ruled catch in Week 14 — was an officiating mistake.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Talk's Michael David Smith, a league spokesman confirmed that the replay review of Rodgers' Week 14 catch was incorrect and it should've been ruled as an interception made by Baltimore Ravens linebacker Teddye Buchanan.\n\nWith the Steelers leading the Ravens 27-22 with around six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Rodgers' pass attempt was batted down by Ravens defensive tackle C.J. Okoye and was ruled an interception by Buchanan. Replay review overturned the play in favor of Pittsburgh.\n\nAdditionally, NFL Executive VP of Football Operations Troy Vincent suggested that another replay reversal from the game, on Isaiah Likely's touchdown, was also wrong.

    "description": "San Francisco might be in trouble.",
    "fullText": "How the 49ers' contract dispute with Trent Williams could impact the NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers cannot afford to lose Canton-bound left tackle Trent Williams.\n\nThe only problem is that they cannot afford to pay him, either.\n\nSan Francisco is dealing with the consequences of an aging roster and an unfulfilled competitive window. With stars demanding raises and a Super Bowl in sight, the 49ers have kicked the cap can down the road long enough. It has come back to bite them, and as Williams inches closer to free agency, San Francisco may have to look to the NFL Draft for his replacement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Adam Schefter reported that releasing Williams is on the table.\n\n\"With five-time All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams scheduled to carry a $39 million cap number this season, he and the 49ers currently are struggling to find a contractual solution, per league sources,\" he posted. \"If the two sides can’t bridge their differences in their standoff, Williams would be expected to join this year’s free-agent class, making him one of the premier players available.\"\n\nOf course, that's not a guarantee of Williams' departure. But Williams is perhaps the most valuable offensive lineman in the sport, appearing bulletproof into his late-30s. He's a stalwart in the game's preeminent rushing attack. And as a crux of Kyle Shanahan's scheme, there's reason to believe the 49ers view the position at a premium.\n\nThe first and most obvious pivot from Williams is an early-round selection in the 2026 NFL Draft. In a tackle class that has fallen short of expectations, a handful of candidates have fallen toward the back of Round 1.\n\nAmong them is Alabama's Kadyn Proctor. At 360 pounds, there are questions about how consistently his athleticism will play at the next level, but high-level play against SEC defensive lines has kept his stock high. Elsewhere, Caleb Lomu held down the blindside for Utah's elite offensive line, offering a more natural fit into Shanahan's zone scheme (at least physically). He's a work in progress as a run blocker, but a first-round pass protector with traits that inspire upside.\n\nLate in Round 1, San Francisco is also in range to capture upward momentum on a prospect like Monroe Freeling, who is bound to rise when athletic testing becomes the most recent source of information.\n\nMORE: 49ers get bad news on Trent Williams amid looming $39 million decision\n\nTaking a first-round tackle could reverberate throughout the NFL's toughest division. The Los Angeles Rams are unsteady at offensive tackle. Right tackle Rob Havenstein has retired, and Warren McClendon Jr. isn't necessarily the long-term answer in his place. The positional difference could render this moot, but the 49ers pick before Los Angeles' second pick in the first round.\n\nThere's a world in which the Rams lose out on their preferred tackle prospect because the 49ers feel they can turn Blake Miller -- or a similarly-valued prospect -- into their franchise left tackle.\n\nFurthermore, it may become clear that replacing Williams isn't a one-man job, but a structural one. San Francisco isn't drafting an upgrade at left tackle in Round 1. Baking in that regression could mean a greater emphasis on other positions, like drafting a receiver for Brandon Aiyuk's vacant snaps or a defensive X-factor to compensate for a step back offensively.\n\nUltimately, teams do an excellent job of keeping their best players in-house for as long as possible. There's little reason why Williams should retire in another team's jersey, and he's enough of a difference-maker to gamble on, even at 37 years old. Losing Williams would be the biggest transaction of San Francisco's offseason, leaving awfully big shoes to fill for whoever the 49ers take at No. 27.\n\nKyle Shanahan has slim pickings to develop next castoff quarterback\n\n49ers get good news on Mac Jones trade rumors\n\nA.J.

Worst feeling I have ever experienced in my life so far,” he wrote in a lengthy Instagram post.\n\nGiacomel’s single photo upload was a selfie of him in a hospital bed with several medical sensors attached to his exposed chest.\n\n“I tried to ski really slow the first part of the third lap but my body wasn’t allowing me to ski anymore,” he continued.\n\nThe athlete added that in the moment, he felt “frustration, anger, [and] disappointment.”\n\n“It’s devastating. It’s devastating to stop but there wasn’t anything I could do against my own body today. Absolutely not the end of the games I was hoping for but I will never give up. 4 years fly by fast and I will try again in France,” Giacomel said.\n\nHe ended his post by letting his supporters know that doctors would continue running medical checks in the coming days to find the root cause of his health issues.\n\n“Get well soon, Tommy! You’ll come back stronger,” the official account for the International Biathlon Union commented.\n\n​​Biathlon is a winter sport that merges cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. It began in 19th-century Scandinavia, originating in ski warfare, and developed from the sport of military patrol.\n\nOn Tuesday, the FISI said their organization’s medical commission completed a series of diagnostic tests on Giacomel in collaboration with Professor Daniele Andreini.\n\nGiacomel “underwent a CT scan, an MRI scan, and a maximal exercise test, all of which were normal.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“A subsequent electrophysiological study revealed an atrial conduction abnormality, which recommended a subsequent ablation, which has already been performed and was a complete success,” the FISI said.\n\nFollowing his discharge from the hospital on Thursday, the Italian athlete who has competed in the Biathlon World Cup since 2019, will have routine check-ups in two weeks.\n\nGiacomel is expected to return to regular training following the completion of those check-ups, FISI said.",

    "fullText": "Not all of the U.S. Men’s Hockey team is in attendance for the State of the Union address.\n\nOver the weekend, the U.S. Men’s Hockey Team pulled off an overtime win against Canada to nab the gold at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The victory sparked celebrations across the country, but the team went viral after FBI Director Kash Patel was seen celebrating in their locker room and later calling President Donald Trump on the phone so that he could congratulate the athletes and invite them to his State of the Union address.\n\nHowever, the president earned a bit of backlash when a video of the call caught him begrudgingly telling the gold medal-winning team, “I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team,” adding that he “probably would be impeached” if he didn’t invite them. The Women’s U.S. Hockey Team also brought home the gold medal at the Olympics.\n\nWhile the majority of the men’s team made the trip Tuesday to Washington, D.C., visiting Trump at the White House before the SOTU address, five players notably did not attend.\n\nJake Guentzel of the Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nBrock Nelson of the Colorado Avalanche\n\nKyle Connor of the Winnipeg Jets\n\nJake Oettinger of the Dallas Stars\n\nJackson LaCombe of the Anaheim Ducks\n\nMost of the players just returned to their respective homes ahead of more games in the upcoming NHL season. It was reported that Nelson wanted to spend time with family before more travel with the Avalanche in the coming days.\n\nTrump did end up inviting the women’s hockey team as well, but they declined, citing “timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments” for missing the State of the Union.\n\n“We are sincerely grateful for the invitation extended to our gold medal-winning U.S. Women’s Hockey Team and deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,” a USA Hockey spokesperson said. “Due to the timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games, the athletes are unable to participate.”\n\nThe majority of the players that ended up making the trip to D.C. on Trump’s invite went on a tour of the White House. They snapped photos on the grounds, looked through the West Wing and then got more pictures with President Trump in the Oval Office while sporting USA sweaters and their Olympic gold medals.\n\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) February 24, 2026\n\nThe post Here’s Which US Men’s Hockey Players Skipped the State of the Union Address appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "A change has been made to the upcoming Gamebred FC card on April 10 that kicks off the $500k heavyweight tournament.\n\nEx-UFC heavyweight Mohammed Usman has been forced off the card due to undisclosed reasons and former UFC light heavyweight title challenger Thiago Santos has been tapped as his replacement. Santos is now set to clash with Guto Inocente in one of the opening round matchups for the 16-man tournament that also features Anthony Smith coming out of retirement to face Chase Sherman on the same card.\n\nPromotion officials confirmed the news to MMA Fighting on Tuesday.\n\nUsman’s exit comes after he was released from the UFC following news that he was facing an 18-month suspension for violating the company’s anti-doping policy.\n\nWith Usman out, Santos takes his place after booking his first fight since 2024 when he faced Denis Goltsov in the PFL. At his peak, Santos ranked as one of the top light heavyweights in the UFC, which included his run for the title when he took Jon Jones to a split decision back at UFC 239 in 2019.\n\nUnfortunately after his razor-close fight against Jones, Santos struggled to get back on track with a 1-7 record with one no contest over his next nine fights.\n\nBut Santos attempts to right the ship when he returns in April to face Inocente in an opening round matchup for the Gamebred FC heavyweight tournament.\n\nThe event takes place in the Dominican Republic with the card airing live on Masvidal’s YouTube channel in April.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLast October, the Los Angeles Dodgers became the eighth team ever to repeat as World Series champions after a grueling seven-game series with the Toronto Blue Jays. They won their ninth championship in franchise history and third in six years.\n\nEven with all of the success during the mid-way point of the decade, manager Dave Roberts is still more excited about what's ahead compared to their past victories.\n\n\"I'm more excited about this year than I was last year or the year prior... Guys are still hungry, and that's scary for the rest of the league,\" Roberts stated.\n\nMore: Giants get great news on top prospect Carson Whisenhunt with huge velocity increase\n\nIf this is truly the case in Los Angeles, that is indeed a scary sight for the rest of the league, because ideally, it is very difficult to believe a team that has consistently been in the mix for a title is hungrier than ever, but when you look at the improvement they continue to make to the team every offseason the competitive nature is obviously still there.\n\nLast season, long-time Chicago Cub Kyle Tucker signed a four-year deal with the Dodgers after already hitting 20+ home runs and having multiple MVP candidates and future Hall of Famers, including Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, and Mookie Betts.\n\nIf the Dodgers win another World Series this season, they would join an even more elite list of teams to three-peat, becoming the third team ever to do so and the first since the New York Yankees did so from 1998-2000.\n\nIt was already going to be tough to knock the Dodgers off their pedestal. Still, with Roberts making a statement like that, it makes it even harder to defeat them as they are a championship team continuing to act like they have a chip on their shoulder.\n\nMLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nYankees' Jazz Chisholm reveals his 9-figure contract asking price\n\nTwins get devastating injury news on Pablo Lopez\n\nCubs' Alex Bregman makes assertive no-trade clause Red Sox statement\n\nGerman Marquez takes shot at Rockies after signing with team that 'wants to win'\n\nMets fans should be concerned with Bo Bichette after fielding struggles go viral\n\nPhillies' Jhoan Duran teases new pitch, but won't reveal what it is",

    "fullText": "It’s that time again, time for the annual NFL Scouting Combine, where the top players in college football who have declared for the NFL draft and are specifically invited are brought to Indianapolis, Indiana’s Lucas Oil Stadium. Each player is then run through a variety of drills and tests based on their position, unless they opt out of a certain phase of the testing. The individual teams’ staff also hold personal interviews with various players that they may be interested in drafting during the annual NFL draft held the following April.\n\nThe Combine can make or break an individual player’s draft status and where they are actually selected. Even the highest-rated players can damage their draft stock with poor testing numbers or a poor personal interview. The reverse is also true: guys who are assumed to be picked much later before the combine can move up the draft, sometimes by a substantial amount, if they are better than expected in their testing and interviews.\n\nWith all of that in mind, this evening’s question is something that I have wondered and at times for sure believed as a long-time (like a very long time) Miami Dolphins fan. So this evening’s question of the day is:\n\nDo you think that our own Miami Dolphins or even the NFL in general has, in the past, relied too much on combine numbers and interviews as opposed to what the players have put on tape in college, in the past, when deciding who to draft, especially in the higher rounds?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

    "fullText": "No. 2 Oregon Responds with Statement Win Over No. 3 Quinnipiac\n\nThe second-ranked Oregon acrobatics and tumbling team delivered a sharper, more complete performance in its home opener Saturday, defeating No. 3 Quinnipiac, 270.640–265.425, at Matthew Knight Arena.\n\nOregon set the tone immediately. A perfect 10.0 in the toss heat of the compulsory event gave the Ducks an early edge, and they controlled the meet from start to finish in a wire-to-wire victory between two top-three programs.\n\nThe win marked clear progress from Oregon’s season-opening score of 267.325 at Missouri State. The Ducks improved by more than three points overall and saw a significant jump in the team event, climbing from 89.100 to 92.290.\n\nHow It Happened\nOregon opened strong in compulsory, winning three of four heats. The highlight came in toss, where the Ducks earned the program’s first perfect 10.0 in the skill since 2020. The side-by-side precision of two quintets delivered the milestone score: Shea Barnes, Kamryn Horiuchi, Charlotte Lippa, Ashlyn Parlett and Emily Rezner; and Selah Bell, Molly Dahlager, Makenna Guidish, Angelica Martin and Blessyn McMorris.\n\nThe Ducks exited the opening event with a 38.000–37.700 lead and built on it in acro, outscoring Quinnipiac 65.100–63.300. Cassidy Cu and Angelica Martin anchored the effort with a 9.800 in the five-element heat and a 9.750 in the seven-element heat.\n\nEveryone's effort! #GoDucks | #Power pic.twitter.com/aaYoucAVUI\n\n— Oregon Acro&Tumbling (@OregonAcroTumb) February 22, 2026\n\nOregon maintained a narrow advantage after pyramid, leading 94.300–92.350. Quinnipiac gained ground in toss, but the Ducks responded in tumbling. Nya Womack posted a 9.800 in the aerial pass, and Morgan Willingham matched that mark in the six-element pass, helping Oregon steady its momentum.\n\nEntering the team event with a slim 178.350–177.175 lead, the Ducks closed emphatically. Oregon outscored the Bobcats 92.290–88.250 in the final event to secure the five-point victory.\n\nUp Next\nOregon hits the road next Saturday for a marquee matchup at No. 1 Baylor, scheduled for 3 p.m.\n\nErickson Blazes to Indoor PR, Ducks Put Two Under 1:47 at Arkansas Qualifier\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Matthew Erickson continued to build momentum toward the postseason Friday night, racing to an indoor personal best of 1:45.93 in the 800 meters at the Arkansas Qualifier.\n\nNew PBs for the 800m men.\nMatti Erickson 1:45.93 (PB, UO No. 2 All-Time)\nJames Harding: 1:46.44 (PB, UO No. 4 All-Time)#GoDucks pic.twitter.com/rfGBlAo1ol\n\n— oregontf (@OregonTF) February 21, 2026\n\nThe reigning NCAA indoor champion finished second overall and became just the second man in Oregon history to break 1:46 indoors, joining school-record holder Charlie Hunter (1:45.59). Based on marks entering the weekend, Erickson moves to No. 7 on the NCAA descending order list.\n\nJames Harding added to the Ducks’ strong showing, clocking a lifetime best of 1:46.44 to place third. His performance elevates him into the top 16 nationally and improves his standing in Oregon’s record book, moving from sixth to fourth all-time indoors. Harding bettered his previous season best of 1:46.83, set earlier this year at the Razorback Invitational.\n\nWith the qualifying window open through conference weekend, the top 16 declared individuals in each event and top 12 relays will advance to the NCAA Indoor Championships, set for March 13–14 in Fayetteville.\n\nFriday Results\nArkansas Qualifier (Fayetteville, Ark.)\nMEN\n800 Meters\n2. Matthew Erickson – 1:45.93 (PB, UO #2*)\n3. James Harding – 1:46.44 (PB, UO #4)\n*already held that ranking, improved mark\n\nOregon DMR Rewrites Record Book, Climbs to No. 2 in NCAA\n\nBOSTON — Oregon’s men’s distance medley relay delivered a historic performance Sunday night, breaking the school record and surging to No. 2 on the NCAA descending order list at the Saucony Battle in Boston.\n\nCompeting at Boston University’s Track & Tennis Center, the quartet of Simeon Birnbaum, Fuad Omer, Elliott Cook and Tomas Palfrey combined for a blistering 9:14.88, making them the second-fastest collegiate DMR team in history.\n\nDQ Friday ➡️ School record Sunday. \nTom Palfrey brings home the Ducks for redemption. #GoDucks pic.twitter.com/RfSbLxIlhw\n\n— oregontf (@OregonTF) February 23, 2026\n\nThe Ducks’ time marks a significant milestone. Oregon becomes just the second program ever to run sub-9:15 on a banked, 200-meter track, joining Virginia, which clocked 9:14.19 earlier this season. Overall, only four programs in NCAA history have broken 9:15 indoors.\n\nSunday’s effort eclipsed the previous school record of 9:17.57, set at last year’s NCAA Indoor Championships in Virginia Beach. Cook, Omer and Palfrey were also members of that record-setting squad, making this latest performance both a breakthrough and a continuation of Oregon’s distance tradition.\n\nThe race proved to be one of the fastest in the country this season. Based on marks entering the meet, three of the top five times nationally were produced Sunday, including Virginia Tech at 9:15.05 and Virginia at 9:16.75.\n\nThe performance came just two days after Oregon competed at the Arkansas Qualifier, underscoring the group’s depth and resilience during a demanding weekend.\n\nWith the NCAA qualifying window open through conference weekend, the top 12 relays will advance to the NCAA Indoor Championships, set for March 13–14 in Fayetteville, Arkansas.

    "fullText": "Note: I currently work with a Payments Engineering team and wrote this as we are introducing spec-driven development into our development workflow.\n\nIf you've used an AI coding tool in the last year, you've probably had the experience: you describe what you want, the AI generates something that looks right, you run it, and... it doesn't quite work. You refine your prompt. The AI fixes one thing and breaks another. Three iterations later you're debugging code you didn't write and don't fully understand.\n\nThis is the failure mode of what Andrej Karpathy called \"vibe coding\" and it's become the default way most developers interact with AI. Spec driven development (SDD) is the emerging counter movement. Instead of throwing prompts at an LLM and hoping for the best, you write a structured specification first, then let the AI implement against it.\n\nThe idea isn't new. We've been writing requirements documents since forever, but the tooling is new. Tools like GitHub's Spec Kit, Amazon's Kiro, and Fission AI's OpenSpec are attempting to formalize this workflow into something repeatable. Whether that formalization helps or hinders depends entirely on what you're building, how you're building it, and the tradeoffs you're willing to make.\n\nOur team uses OpenSpec, so most of the practical examples in this post come from that experience. But the principles apply regardless of which tool you pick.\n\nThe pitch for AI assisted coding is attractive: describe what you want in English and get working code back. And for simple tasks, a helper function, a config change, renaming a module, it works remarkably well. The challenges starts when changes aren't trivial but require edits to multiple files or packages/modules.\n\nThe core issue is context loss. When you're five prompts deep into a feature, the AI has no persistent memory of the architectural decisions you made in prompt one. It doesn't know you chose a specific idempotency strategy for a reason. It doesn't remember that you explicitly avoided storing raw card data outside the tokenization boundary. Every new prompt starts from a partial view of the world, and the AI fills in the gaps with whatever patterns it's seen most in training data.\n\nIn payments systems, this produces particularly dangerous failures. Reconciliation logic scattered across three different modules because each prompt generated its own approach. A refund handler that doesn't account for partial captures. Currency conversion applied twice because the AI didn't know about the upstream normalization step. And perhaps most critically in our domain, security flaws: API keys committed to source, missing input validation on transaction amounts, authorization checks that live on the client instead of the server. Studies have found that roughly 45% of AI generated code contains security vulnerabilities. In a payments context, that's more than just a bug but a compliance issue.\n\nThe other failure is architectural drift. Without a shared plan, each prompt/response cycle makes locally reasonable decisions that are globally incoherent. The AI can't refactor itself out of architectural problems it doesn't understand. You ask it to add retry logic to a payment gateway call and it builds a standalone retry mechanism, unaware that you already have a circuit breaker pattern in your infrastructure layer. Once the codebase reaches a certain size, the context window can only see fragments of it. You end up with a system that processes transactions but that nobody, including the AI, fully understands anymore.\n\nThis isn't the AI being dumb. It's the natural consequence of building without a map.\n\nAt its simplest, spec driven development means: write down what you're building before you write the code, and make that written artifact the thing your AI agent works from.\n\nThat might sound like waterfall but It's not, or at least, it doesn't have to be. The key differences are timescale and scope. Traditional waterfall specs were project level documents written over weeks and often carved in stone. SDD specs are feature level documents written in minutes and meant to evolve. You're not planning an entire system upfront; you're planning the next meaningful chunk of work in enough detail that an AI can implement it without guessing.\n\nA typical SDD workflow looks like this:\n\nYou're not writing all of this yourself. You describe the intent in natural language, and the AI generates the spec artifacts: the proposal, the requirements, the design, the task breakdown. Your job is to review, refine, and correct. You steer and the AI does the heavy lifting. This is what makes the process fast enough to be practical. Writing a 200 line spec by hand for every feature would be painful. Having the AI draft it in 30 seconds and then spending 5 minutes reviewing and adjusting it is a different proposition entirely.\n\nThe spec becomes a persistent artifact, a \"super prompt\" that doesn't disappear when your chat session ends. It lives in version control alongside your code. When the AI drifts, you point it back to the spec. When requirements change, you update the spec and regenerate.\n\nThe fundamental shift is that the specification becomes the source of truth, and code becomes the derived artifact. Traditional documentation describes code that already exists. SDD inverts that relationship. You define the behaviour, constraints, and architecture in the spec, and the AI produces code that conforms to it. The spec isn't something you write after the fact to explain what was built but the input that determines what gets built. Code is the output.\n\nThree tools have emerged as the most prominent in this space. Each takes a different philosophical approach.\n\nSpec Kit is an open source CLI from GitHub that scaffolds a spec driven workflow into your existing project. It's agent agnostic, working with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others. The workflow follows rigid phases driven by slash commands: /speckit.constitution to establish project principles, /speckit.specify to create feature specs, /speckit.plan for a technical plan, /speckit.tasks for work items, and /speckit.implement to execute.\n\nStrengths: Thorough documentation output, the \"constitution\" concept for project wide principles, works with many agents.\n\nWeaknesses: Heavyweight. Sometimes it get generate a lot of artifacts for simple changes. Rigid phase gates mean you can't easily jump back and forth between planning and implementing.\n\nKiro is a full IDE (a VS Code fork) with spec driven development baked into the editing experience. The workflow follows a similar shape (requirements → design → tasks → implement) but is tightly integrated with the editor. It generates user stories with acceptance criteria, creates technical design documents, and produces task lists. It also introduces \"Hooks,\" user defined prompts triggered by file changes.\n\nStrengths: Most polished integrated experience. The Hooks system is excellent and something you'd have to configure manually if you decide to do it on your own. No context switching between planning and editing because of the IDE integration.\n\nWeaknesses: You're locked into their IDE and limited to Claude models. Can be overkill for small changes. One developer reported a simple bug fix generating 4 user stories with 16 acceptance criteria. The overhead can be significant.\n\nOpenSpec is the most lightweight of the three. It's a TypeScript CLI with a fluid, iterative workflow and no rigid phase gates. Where Spec Kit enforces a strict sequence and Kiro wraps everything in an IDE, OpenSpec gets out of your way and lets you move between planning artifacts freely.\n\nIts distinguishing philosophy is \"brownfield first.\" While the other tools are optimized for building new things from scratch, OpenSpec is designed to work with existing codebases. Each change produces a \"spec delta,\" a document that captures what's being added, modified, or removed relative to the existing system. Over time, these deltas merge into a living specification that reflects the current state of the system.\n\nOpenSpec also handles change history better. Every completed change is archived with its full artifact set: the original proposal, the spec deltas, the design, and the task list. This means you can go back and see not just what changed in the system, but why it changed, what alternatives were considered in the design, and what the original acceptance criteria were. Spec Kit and Kiro generate artifacts during planning but don't have the same structured archive and merge cycle. In OpenSpec, the openspec/changes/archive/ directory becomes a chronological record of every significant change to the system, and the openspec/specs/ directory is always the merged, current truth. For regulated environments where auditability matters, this distinction is significant.\n\nStrengths: Works with 20+ AI tools including Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, and many others. The brownfield focus is valuable in our context as most real work is on existing codebases. Fluid workflow lets you update any artifact at any time and you are not forced into a linear way of working. The archive/merge cycle produces both a living spec and an auditable change history.\n\nWeaknesses: Less hand holding in the spec writing process is the trade-off it makes while allowing you to navigate back-and-forth between spec and implementation. The tool is newer and the ecosystem is still growing.\n\nOpenSpec requires Node.js 20.19.0 or higher.\n\nThen navigate to your project directory and initialize:\n\nThe init process will ask which AI tool you're using and configure the appropriate slash commands or agent instructions for your environment.\n\nOpenSpec also works with pnpm, yarn, bun, and nix. See the official installation docs for alternative paths.\n\nThen refresh agent instructions in each project:\n\nUnderstanding the full lifecycle of an OpenSpec change is worth the time, because the artifacts it generates serve different roles on the team in different ways.\n\nOpenSpec's workflow is built around the opsx slash commands. Here's the complete set, the ones you interact with the most are bolded:\n\nThe typical flow is new → ff → apply → archive, but the power of OpenSpec is that you can break out of that sequence at any point. Need to revisit the design after you've started implementing? Just edit design.md. Want to add acceptance criteria while coding? Update the spec delta. There are no phase gates forcing you to \"finish\" one stage before moving to another.\n\nOne of the first decisions in any OpenSpec workflow is how you enter it. There are two entry points, and choosing the right one makes a real difference in the quality of what comes out the other side.\n\n/opsx:new is for when you know what you're building. You have a clear feature in mind, you understand the requirements well enough to describe them, and you're ready to start generating planning artifacts. Maybe you've already discussed this in a planning meeting. Maybe you've built something similar before. Maybe the ticket is well defined and you just need to formalize it. In these cases, /opsx:new add-feature-name followed by /opsx:ff gets you from zero to a full set of planning documents in minutes.\n\nThis works well when the problem space is familiar and constraints are understood. You've implemented retry logic before, you know the gateway's behavior, you just need to formalize it.\n\n/opsx:explore is for when you're still figuring things out. Maybe you have a vague idea but the requirements aren't clear. Maybe you're investigating a production anomaly and you don't know where the root cause is yet. Maybe a stakeholder said \"we need to support instant payments\" and you need to figure out what that actually means for your settlement architecture before you can spec anything.\n\nExplore opens a broader, open ended conversation with the AI before any change folder is created and before any artifacts are generated. There's no structure imposed, no proposal template to fill out, no pressure to define acceptance criteria. You're just thinking out loud with an assistant that has context on your codebase.\n\nThe explore conversation might last five minutes or an hour. It might branch into several tangents before converging on a clear problem statement. That's intentional. You're doing the messy, nonlinear thinking that produces good requirements, and you're doing it before the spec exists rather than discovering gaps during implementation.\n\nThis is also where existing requirements documents from business analysts become valuable. In payments organizations, BAs often produce detailed feature requirements independently of any SDD tool: field mapping spreadsheets, business rule matrices, sample ISO 20022 payloads (pain.001, pain.008, pacs.008), regulatory constraint documents, and workflow diagrams. These artifacts are the raw material that explore turns into actionable specs.\n\nRather than asking the AI to invent requirements from scratch, you feed it the BA's work:\n\nThe explore phase becomes a bridge between the BA's domain knowledge and the engineering reality of the codebase. The BA doesn't need to know about your GenServer architecture or your Ecto schema conventions. The developer doesn't need to memorize the ISO 20022 payload structure. Explore lets both perspectives converge into a proposal that reflects both business intent and technical feasibility.\n\nWhen you've reached clarity, you transition naturally into the structured workflow:\n\nNow the proposal and specs will be grounded in both the BA's requirements and the technical understanding you built during exploration, rather than being generated from a one line prompt.\n\nUse /opsx:new when you can describe the feature or fix in a sentence and you're confident in the scope. Use /opsx:explore when any of the following are true: you're unsure what the root cause of a problem is, the requirements are ambiguous or underspecified, you need to evaluate multiple approaches before committing to one, or you want to pressure test an idea before investing in formal planning. In practice, we find ourselves using explore more often than we initially expected. The few minutes spent thinking before speccing consistently produce better specs, which in turn produce better code.\n\nWhen you run /opsx:new add-idempotent-refunds, OpenSpec creates a change directory:\n\nRunning /opsx:ff (or stepping through with /opsx:continue) generates the planning artifacts:\n\nEach of these artifacts has a specific purpose and a specific audience. Let's look at what goes into them.\n\nproposal.md is the \"why\" document. It describes the motivation for the change, the scope of what's included and excluded, and any constraints or dependencies. This is the document you'd share in a planning meeting or attach to a ticket. It answers the question: \"Why are we doing this, and what does 'done' look like at a high level?\" For a refunds feature, this might capture that the driver is duplicate refund incidents costing the business money, that the scope includes full and partial refunds but excludes chargebacks, and that the constraint is backwards compatibility with the existing refund API contract.\n\nspecs/ contains the spec delta, the functional requirements for this specific change. Requirements are marked as ADDED, MODIFIED, or REMOVED relative to the current system. Each requirement uses structured language (\"The system SHALL...\") with clear acceptance criteria and scenarios. This is where edge cases live. This is where you define what happens when a refund is submitted with the same idempotency key as a previous request, what the system does when the gateway returns a timeout mid refund, or how partial refunds interact with the original transaction's settlement status.\n\ndesign.md is the technical blueprint. It covers the data model, API contracts, component architecture, sequence flows, and any technology choices specific to this feature. For the refunds example, it's where you'd document the idempotency key storage strategy, the state machine transitions for refund lifecycle, and the gateway adapter interface for multi acquirer support.\n\ntasks.md breaks the work into discrete, ordered implementation steps. Each task is small enough to verify independently, ideally something that can be implemented in under 30 minutes. Tasks have clear completion criteria so both the developer and the AI know when they're done.\n\nWhen all tasks are complete and verified, /opsx:archive does something important: it merges the spec deltas from the change back into the main openspec/specs/ directory. The change folder moves to openspec/changes/archive/, preserving the history. The main specs now reflect the updated state of the system.\n\nThis is the mechanism that turns specs into a living document. After a dozen features have been built and archived, openspec/specs/ contains a comprehensive, up to date description of what the system does. Not what it was designed to do originally, but what it actually does right now.\n\nOne of the underappreciated aspects of spec driven development is that the artifacts aren't just for the developer writing the code. They create value across every role that touches the project.\n\nThe immediate benefit is implementation quality. Instead of translating a vague Jira ticket into code via a series of increasingly frustrated prompts, you're working from a spec that already captures requirements, edge cases, and technical decisions. The AI produces better code because it has better context. You spend less time debugging and reworking because misunderstandings surface during spec review, not during code review.\n\nThe longer term benefit is onboarding and maintenance. When you come back to a feature six months later, or when a new developer joins the team, the spec explains not just what the code does but why it was built that way. The proposal captures the business motivation. The design doc captures the technical rationale. The spec captures the behavioral contract.\n\nThe proposal and spec artifacts are written in structured natural language, not code. A BA or PM can read proposal.md and immediately understand the scope, motivation, and acceptance criteria for a change without needing to parse a pull request.\n\nMore importantly, they can contribute to these documents. If the spec says \"The system SHALL retry failed direct debit collections up to 3 times\" and the BA knows the scheme rules mandate a maximum of 2 retries with specific interval requirements, they can flag that in the spec before any code is written. The spec becomes a shared contract between product and engineering, reviewable by both sides.\n\nBAs in payments organizations often produce detailed requirements documents that exist outside of any development tool: field mapping spreadsheets between internal formats and ISO 20022 messages, business rule matrices for transaction routing, sample payloads for pain.001 or pacs.008 messages, regulatory constraint documents, and scheme specific validation rules. These documents don't need to be rewritten into OpenSpec format. Instead, they serve as input to the /opsx:explore conversation and as reference material that the proposal and specs can point to. The spec might say \"Field mappings follow the BA's pain.008 mapping document (see docs/ba-requirements/sepa-dd-field-mappings.xlsx)\" rather than duplicating that content. OpenSpec captures the engineering requirements; the BA's documents capture the domain requirements. The two reference each other.\n\nFor teams practicing any kind of requirements analysis, the spec delta format (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED) maps naturally to how BAs think about change impact. You can see at a glance exactly what existing behavior is changing and what's new.\n\nThe specs are essentially test plans waiting to happen. Each requirement with its acceptance criteria maps directly to test cases. \"WHEN a refund is submitted with an idempotency key matching a previously completed refund, THEN the system SHALL return the original refund response without processing a duplicate\" is a test case in all but name.\n\nQA can review specs before implementation begins, catching gaps in test coverage at the cheapest possible point in the development cycle. In payments, where edge cases around timeouts, partial failures, and concurrent operations are where bugs hide, having QA eyes on the spec early is especially valuable. They can also use specs to verify completeness: does the implementation actually cover every scenario in the spec? OpenSpec's /opsx:verify command automates part of this check, but human QA review of the spec itself is where the real value lies.\n\nThe design document is where architectural oversight happens. A principal can review design.md to ensure the proposed approach fits the system's overall architecture, without needing to wait for a code review to discover that someone introduced a new database table that duplicates an existing one, or bypassed the payment gateway abstraction layer by calling the acquirer API directly.\n\nThe proposal document is equally valuable at this level. It provides enough context to make prioritization decisions, estimate impact on downstream systems like settlement and reconciliation, and flag dependencies before work begins.\n\nFor organizations running architecture review boards or design review processes, OpenSpec artifacts slot directly into those workflows. The artifacts are markdown in version control, which means they can be reviewed through the same pull request process as code.\n\nThe openspec/specs/ directory, the living spec that accumulates as changes are archived, becomes something like institutional memory for the project. It captures not just the current state of the system but the evolution of requirements over time. New team members can browse the specs to understand the system. Archived changes provide an audit trail of what changed, when, and why.\n\nThis is especially valuable for distributed teams where not everyone is in every meeting. The spec is always available, always current, and always in the repo.\n\nIn most payments organizations, business analysts produce detailed requirements documents long before any developer opens an IDE. These documents are the product of weeks of domain analysis: field mapping spreadsheets that map internal data structures to ISO 20022 message formats like pain.001 or pacs.008, business rule matrices that define transaction routing logic, validation rules derived from scheme specifications, sample XML payloads, regulatory constraint summaries, and workflow diagrams for processes like mandate lifecycle management or chargeback dispute flows.\n\nThese artifacts are enormously valuable. They represent concentrated domain knowledge that no AI model has in its training data. But they exist outside of any development tool, usually in Confluence pages, shared drives, or Excel files. The question is: where do they plug into the SDD workflow?\n\nRather than asking the AI to invent payment domain requirements from scratch (which it will get wrong in subtle, dangerous ways), you feed the BA's existing documents into the explore conversation. The AI reads the BA's field mappings, business rules, and sample payloads, then maps them against your actual codebase. The explore conversation becomes a structured dialogue about feasibility: which business rules can be implemented directly, which ones require architectural changes, where the BA's requirements conflict with existing behavior, and what edge cases the BA may not have considered from a technical perspective.\n\nThis conversation might reveal that 70% of the BA's requirements map cleanly to existing patterns and 30% require new design decisions. Those design decisions then flow into the proposal and spec with full context, rather than being invented by the AI from a one sentence prompt.\n\nThe key principle: the BA's documents are input to the spec, not replaced by it. The OpenSpec proposal can reference them directly (\"Field mappings follow the BA's pain.008 mapping document, see docs/ba-requirements/sepa-dd-field-mappings.xlsx\"). The spec captures the engineering interpretation of business requirements, while the BA's artifacts remain the authoritative source for domain rules. The two complement each other.\n\nFor teams with a strong BA function, this workflow turns explore into the most valuable step in the entire process. It's where domain expertise meets technical reality, and where misunderstandings between product and engineering get caught before they become expensive.\n\nFor years, the standard way to decompose work in software organizations has been the Agile hierarchy: Epics break into Features, Features break into User Stories, User Stories break into Tasks. Each layer adds structure, and each layer adds overhead. Grooming sessions to refine stories. Estimation ceremonies to assign points. Sprint planning to negotiate what fits. Story splitting when something is \"too big.\" Acceptance criteria written in Given/When/Then format.\n\nThis process was designed for a world where humans wrote every line of code, and work needed to be decomposed into pieces small enough for one developer to complete in a sprint. The granularity served a coordination function: if three developers are working on the same feature in parallel, you need clearly bounded units of work to avoid stepping on each other.\n\nWith AI agents handling the bulk of code generation, developers now work in significantly larger chunks. A feature that would have been split into 8 user stories with 24 tasks can be described as a single spec and implemented in one session. The AI doesn't need two week sprints to context switch between stories. It doesn't need story points to estimate effort. It doesn't care whether a unit of work is a 3 or a 5. It needs a clear description of what to build and enough context to build it correctly.\n\nThe overhead of the old hierarchy was always significant. Ceremonies consume 15-30% of a team's time. The BA writes detailed requirements and translates them into epics and stories. The tech lead estimates them. The developer re-interprets them during implementation. Each translation step is an opportunity for information loss.\n\nSDD collapses this. Instead of an Epic with 5 Features containing 20 User Stories containing 60 Tasks, you have a proposal that captures the business intent, a spec that defines the requirements, a design that describes the technical approach, and a task list that the AI executes against. The entire chain from \"why are we doing this\" to \"what code gets written\" lives in one change folder, reviewable as a single unit. There's no translation loss and the spec is the shared artifact that all of those roles read, review, and contribute to.\n\nThis doesn't mean you abandon planning. It means the unit of planning shifts from \"what can one developer finish in two days\" to \"what is the next coherent change to the system.\" That change might be small (fix a settlement rounding error) or large (add multi currency support). The spec scales to fit either. And because the AI generates the task breakdown from the spec, you don't need to spend planning meetings debating granularity. The tasks exist to guide the AI's implementation, not to fill a sprint board.\n\nSDD offers a natural landing spot for a switch to AI-first development. You keep the parts that matter (clear requirements, technical review, incremental delivery) and shed the parts that were only ever coordination scaffolding.\n\nLet's walk through a concrete example using OpenSpec to add multi currency settlement support to a payment processing platform.\n\nStep 1: Explore (optional but useful)\n\nIf the requirements aren't fully clear, or if you have BA created documents that need to be digested before planning, start with exploration:\n\nThis step is for thinking, not committing. No change folder is created yet.\n\nStep 3: Generate planning artifacts\n\nIf you have a clear picture of what to build, fast forward through all planning stages:\n\nAlternatively, use /opsx:continue to step through one phase at a time, reviewing and refining each artifact before moving to the next.\n\nStep 4: Review and refine the artifacts\n\nThis is the most important step. Read the generated proposal, specs, and design. Push back on anything that doesn't match your intent:\n\nReal work isn't linear. OpenSpec handles context switches gracefully because your plan lives in the artifacts, not in the AI's memory.\n\nOne important detail: during /opsx:apply, you can stop the AI at any point while monitoring its output. If you see it heading in the wrong direction on task 1.3, you stop it, correct course, and resume. The task list in tasks.md tracks what's been completed, so nothing about your plan is lost. This is fundamentally different from vibe coding, where stopping mid stream means losing context and hoping you can reconstruct where you were.\n\nThe same principle applies to bigger interrupts. You can pause an entire feature to handle something urgent:\n\nThe multi currency feature picks up exactly where it left off. The artifacts held the plan while you were away, whether that was five minutes or five days.\n\nSDD is not appropriate in all cases. Here are some cases where the overhead isn't worth it:\n\nQuick bug fixes. If you know exactly what's wrong and the fix is a one line change to a gateway timeout value, writing a spec is like filing a building permit to hang a picture frame. Just fix it.\n\nExploratory prototyping. When you're trying to figure out what to build, not how to build it, specs slow you down. Vibe coding is genuinely great for rapid exploration. If you're prototyping a new merchant dashboard layout to see what feels right, just build it iteratively.\n\nHighly visual or interactive work. SDD tools are text based. If your feature is primarily about UI layout, animation, or interaction design, you'll spend more time describing the visual result in markdown than you'd spend just building it with visual feedback (though pairing SDD with TideWave can work wonders for UI work).\n\nTrivial features. Updating an error message string, renaming a config key, bumping a dependency version. These don't need a spec. Use your judgment about the complexity threshold.\n\nRapidly changing requirements. If you're in a phase where the payment scheme keeps revising the spec and requirements shift weekly, maintaining your own specs becomes overhead that fights against your pace. Get to stability first, then spec the features that need to stick.\n\nThe general rule: if you can hold the entire change in your head and verify it by looking at it, you probably don't need a spec. If the change involves multiple files, multiple concerns, or behavior you can't verify visually, a spec starts paying for itself.\n\nHaving used these tools and studied the experiences of others, here are the traps:\n\nSpec bloat. The AI loves to generate exhaustive specifications. A feature that would take you 30 minutes to implement can produce 800+ lines of markdown. You have to be disciplined about trimming specs to what's actually useful. If you're not reading the spec carefully, it's worse than not having one because you'll have false confidence that edge cases are covered when they're not.\n\nThe waterfall trap. SDD can slide into big design up front if you're not careful and start bundling many features into one spec. If changing the spec feels expensive or bureaucratic, you've over formalized. OpenSpec's fluid workflow helps here since there are no phase gates, but you still need the discipline to keep specs lightweight enough to throw away and rewrite if you find yourself going down the wrong path.\n\nSpec drift. The spec says one thing; the code does another. This happens when you make implementation fixes outside the spec workflow. Either update the spec when you deviate, or accept that the spec is aspirational rather than authoritative. OpenSpec's /opsx:sync command can help keep specs aligned during long running changes.\n\nThe AI ignores its own spec. This is a real and documented problem. Context windows are larger, but that doesn't mean the AI attends to everything in them equally. People have reported that AI agents generate code that contradicts the spec they just wrote, creating duplicate classes, ignoring constraints, or implementing patterns the spec explicitly avoided. The /opsx:verify step exists specifically to catch this.\n\nReview fatigue. SDD adds a new category of artifact to review. You're now reviewing specs AND code. If your team doesn't value spec review as highly as code review, specs become rubber stamped documents that provide an illusion of rigour.\n\nOver application to small changes. The tooling doesn't scale down well. Applying the full SDD workflow to a minor feature creates overhead that dwarfs the implementation time. You need a personal threshold for when to spec and when to just build.\n\nEvery discussion of SDD eventually arrives at the same question: isn't this just waterfall with better marketing?\n\nThe comparison is fair to raise and unfair to leave unexamined. Traditional waterfall failed because of long feedback loops: months of design, months of implementation, and discovery at the end that the design didn't match reality. The feedback cycle was measured in quarters.\n\nSDD, practiced well, has feedback cycles measured in minutes to hours. You write a spec for a single feature, not an entire system. You review the generated design before implementation starts. You implement in small, verifiable tasks. And critically, changing the spec and regenerating is cheap. The whole point is that code is a derived artifact you can throw away and recreate.\n\nSDD can slide into waterfall like rigidity if you treat specs as immutable, if the spec writing phase becomes its own bottleneck, or if you use SDD as a substitute for iterative discovery. As Gojko Adzic observed, the movement builds on solid intent-first ideas but could reintroduce rigidity if practitioners aren't thoughtful about it.\n\nThe Thoughtworks perspective captures the nuance well: the problems of vibe coding come from being too fast, spontaneous, and haphazard, while the problems of waterfall come from being too slow, rigid, and disconnected from reality. SDD, when practiced well, occupies the middle ground. It provides a mechanism for shorter and more effective feedback loops than either extreme.\n\nThe honest answer is that SDD sits on a spectrum. At one end, you have \"spec as lightweight sketch,\" a quick outline that gives the AI direction without constraining it. At the other end, you have \"spec as source of truth,\" a comprehensive document that the code must conform to. OpenSpec's fluid approach leans toward the lighter end of that spectrum, which is why it appeals to teams who want discipline without ceremony.\n\nReduced rework. Catching misunderstandings at the spec level is dramatically cheaper than catching them in code. When a BA's field mapping is wrong, you want to discover that while reviewing a proposal, not while debugging a failed settlement file at 2 AM.\n\nPersistent context. Specs survive session boundaries, tool switches, and team changes. Six months from now, when someone asks why the FX rate locking works the way it does, the spec and its proposal explain both the what and the why.\n\nReviewable intent across roles. You can review a spec without reading any code. Product managers, BAs, QA, and principals can participate in spec review and catch requirement gaps before implementation begins. In a payments context, this means compliance can review the spec for regulatory alignment without needing to read Elixir.\n\nTime upfront. Writing and reviewing specs takes time that vibe coding doesn't require. For simple tasks, this overhead is pure cost with minimal benefit.\n\nFalse precision. Detailed specs can create an illusion of completeness. Just because the spec covers edge cases on paper doesn't mean the AI will implement them correctly. You still need to test.\n\nTool immaturity. These tools are all early stage. Expect rough edges, breaking changes, and workflow gaps. The ecosystem is moving fast, which means today's best practices may be obsolete in six months.\n\nSpec driven development is less than a year old as a named practice, and the tooling is evolving fast. The fundamental insight, that AI agents produce better code when given structured intent rather than ad hoc prompts, seems durable even if the specific tools don't survive.\n\nWhat's interesting is the convergence. BDD (Behavior Driven Development), TDD (Test Driven Development), and now SDD all share the same DNA: define the desired behavior before writing the implementation. SDD is that idea adapted for a world where the implementer is an AI agent rather than a human developer.\n\nThe open question is whether specs will remain the domain of dedicated tools, or whether this discipline gets absorbed into the AI coding tools themselves. We're already seeing Cursor, Claude Code, and Copilot add planning and multi step reasoning capabilities that accomplish some of what SDD tools do, without the explicit spec writing step.\n\nFor now, the practical takeaway is simple: if you're doing anything more complex than a quick prototype with AI coding tools, some form of structured planning, whether you call it SDD or just \"thinking before prompting,\" will produce better results than vibing your way through it. The tools can help enforce that discipline, but the discipline itself is what matters.\n\nThe spec isn't the point. The thinking is.",

    "description": "Court documents show how investigators can track digital activities, and reveal ways to harden journalists’ devices",
    "fullText": "The January FBI raid of the home of Washington Post federal government reporter Hannah Natanson, in connection with a leak probe involving a government contractor, was a dangerous escalation against press freedom and likely runs afoul of the Privacy Protection Act. It shouldn’t have happened at all.\n\nA judge has since ordered that the government preserve, but not review, the materials seized during the raid. We’ve recently examined a court document that shines light on some specifics of the case, and think journalists can learn something from what it reveals.\n\nThe court filing suggests Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones, the government contractor, allegedly viewed a document later published by Natanson and took screenshots before pasting those images into a new Microsoft Word document.\n\nIf you use a work-issued computer or phone at any well-resourced organization, like a government agency, it’s quite likely that there are a handful of technologies to track employee activities baked into your device.\n\nServices like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 provide administrators with audit logs of employees’ activities, such as the user who opened a given document, actions taken in the document, and when they were taken.\n\nIn practice, this means investigators could see a list of everyone who accessed a leaked document and make a short list of likely sources of the leak.\n\nMany workplaces also use mobile device management services to equip workplace devices with security monitoring, control, and visibility into those devices.\n\nIn this case, we see that investigators were able to detect Perez-Lugones’ screenshot, which likely would have removed some metadata — information about the original document — before he printed it out as a new document.\n\nA well-resourced work environment, unfortunately, has an extraordinary level of visibility into employees’ activities on their devices. Sources should therefore generally assume what they do on workplace laptops, phones, networks, and physical spaces is being recorded.\n\nThe document suggests investigators were authorized to force the reporter to use biometrics to unlock devices, using her fingerprints or the face scanners built into her devices.\n\nAfter seizing her MacBook Pro, Natanson was told to unlock it with her fingerprint.\n\nWhile rare, we have seen other examples of law enforcement actors obtaining permission and attempting to use biometric unlocks with tools like Face ID and Touch ID to force reporters to unlock their devices.\n\nThere is a place for biometrics — the alternative would be typing in your passcode dozens or even hundreds of times each day, which would encourage weaker passcodes. (And we hope you use a long, unique passcode!)\n\nBut if you are going into a scenario where you expect it’s possible your phone may be seized, such as when going through airport security, disabling biometrics doesn’t hurt.\n\nNatanson probably couldn’t reasonably have predicted that her devices were about to be seized, and it’s therefore harder to prepare for a situation like this.\n\nWe do know that many raids happen before dawn, so this points to a benefit in shutting down your computer before bed and when not in use.\n\nYou can also quickly disable biometrics at any time by holding the power button and the volume-up button on your phone at the same time. This will immediately disable biometrics on an iPhone, but on Android, you may need to click “Lockdown” afterward. Android users may need to enable this from the Settings app.\n\nIf you feel comfortable simply typing in your passcode on your desktop computer, consider disabling biometrics on your desktop and using a passcode to unlock the device. You can always continue using biometric features like Touch ID on your laptop with other services after the device is unlocked.\n\nOnce investigators unlocked her workplace laptop, they took photos and audio recordings of the conversations in the laptop’s Signal application.\n\nThis also brings up the challenging question of when to use Signal for Desktop. Signal for Desktop is convenient — I use it every day. But Signal is only as secure as your devices.\n\nIt first needs to be installed on your mobile device, which comes with its own risk of being infected with malware that could compromise your messages.\n\nIf you link your Signal account to your desktop, you are introducing even more risk. That’s a choice you’ll have to make.\n\nRegardless, you need to keep your Signal app up to date, along with every device using Signal, to ensure you’re receiving the newest security patches.\n\nLikewise, there are situations where journalists may need to retain their messages, but not all messages need to live on your device indefinitely.\n\nWhen possible, reporters may want to enable Signal’s disappearing messages to minimize the risk of your messages being read if someone snatches your phone, or simply in case of loss or theft. Read our guide to locking down Signal to learn how to set it up.\n\nIt appears data on the reporter’s iPhone could not be extracted using forensic devices, at least in part because Apple’s Lockdown Mode was enabled.\n\nWhat’s Lockdown Mode, you ask? It’s an optional feature built into Apple devices that allows you to harden your device by disabling some features, such as certain forms of message attachments.\n\nImportantly, when your iPhone is locked, it also disables connections from accessories, such as USB devices. Many forensic devices plug directly into your phone in order to connect, and this means they appear to have a tougher time connecting when Lockdown Mode is enabled.\n\nIf you feel at risk, consider trying out Lockdown Mode, or if you have an Android phone, enable Advanced Protection. Disabling some technologies to harden your device may affect how your phone works slightly. But you may appreciate the added assurance.\n\nResearch from forensic companies like Cellebrite shows that they have a tougher time breaking into newer and up-to-date phones. So while you’re at it, download your updates as soon as you can. Read more about mobile device safety.\n\nWe understand that investigators seized multiple devices, including an audio recorder and an external hard drive.\n\nUsually, there is no straightforward way to encrypt certain devices, such as dedicated cameras and recording devices. However, you can off-load information from these devices immediately to a device that you can encrypt, such as your computer.\n\nYou can encrypt your computer’s drive by enabling FileVault for Macs, and BitLocker for Windows Pro’s Enterprise and Education editions. On Linux, you can encrypt your device with LUKS. A modern, up-to-date iPhone or Android device will be encrypted by default by simply having a passcode.\n\nNote that disk encryption is fully enabled until you type in your passcode to decrypt the device. The easiest way to enable disk encryption is therefore to simply power down your device.\n\nThis raid was extraordinary, but the things we can do to protect the data on our devices are not, and may apply to more routine security issues, like the potential for loss or theft. Take some time to learn about things you can do to protect your device by reading our guide to mobile maintenance. And journalists can always reach out to our digital security team for assistance.",

    "fullText": "CGIT 1.3 Web Frontend For Git Released After Six Years\n\nJason Donenfeld of WireGuard and Linux cryptography fame has taken a break from that to release a new version of CGIT, the lightweight web interface for Git repositories. CGIT 1.3 is the first new release in six years and comes with a lot of changes.\r\nFor those not needing to manage pull requests or other features from your Git web interface but simply needing a web-based viewer for reading Git repositories, CGIT remains one of the best options around. CGIT is lightweight, doesn't depend upon JavaScript and is very efficient in being written in C, and also powers the likes of git.kernel.org.\r\nWith CGIT 1.3 there are many bug fixes, updating against the latest Git 2.53 functionality, updates to the CSS styling for CGIT, and also the very first (optional) JavaScript based functionality. JavaScript is being used for CGIT's dynamic aging feature. The JavaScript feature is to dynamically update the \"ages\" of GIt commits and the like on client side. So not too scary and no fundamental loss if blocking JavaScript in your browser.\r\nMore details on CGIT 1.3 can be found via the mailing list release announcement.\n\n 5 Comments",

    "description": "Google is apologizing after a news alert about John Davidson saying a racial slur at the 2026 BAFTAs included the N-word written out.",
    "fullText": "\"What an interesting Black History month this has turned out to be,\" Instagram user Danny Price captioned the post revealing the offensive alert.\n\nGoogle is apologizing after publishing a news alert about Sunday's BAFTA Awards racial slur incident, with the N-word written out.\n\nA screenshot of the notification was shared online by Instagram user Danny Price, who shared several photos to his page. The alert linked out to an article by The Hollywood Reporter, which had the headline: \"How the Tourette's Fallout Unfolded at the BAFTA Film Awards.\" The notification then invited readers to \"see more on [the N-word].\"\n\nAlongside the several slides showing the Google alert, Price wrote that the occurrence was \"absolutely f---ed.\"\n\n\"What an interesting Black History month this has turned out to be,\" Price added in the caption of his post.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Entertainment Weekly: \"We're deeply sorry for this mistake. We've removed the offensive notification and are working to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\nThe tech giant told EW that the \"system error did not involve AI\" and was a case of safety filters not catching an error, adding, \"This was a mistake that shouldn't have happened. We're working on improved guardrails for our push notification systems, which are designed to accurately characterize content from across the web.\"\n\nThe tech company shared that its systems recognized \"a euphemism for an offensive term\" on several web pages, and \"accidentally\" used the offensive term in the notification text. \"We caught the mistake quickly, and immediately removed it from people's devices,\" the company added. \"Only a very small subset of Google app users who get push notifications received it. This system error did not involve AI. Our safety filters did not properly trigger, which is what caused this.\"\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nThe upset follows a bevy of reactions in the aftermath of Tourette syndrome activist John Davidson — who attended the BAFTAs in honor of I Swear, a film about his experience living with Tourette's — shouting the N-word when Sinners stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented the Best Visual Effects award to Avatar: Fire and Ash. Afterwards, the show continued on, and host Alan Cumming addressed the incident with a brief statement.\n\nSinners' production designer and nominee Hannah Beachler alleged on X that she had also had a racial slur directed at her, and criticized what she called a \"throw away\" apology from the BAFTAs.\n\nBeachler also alleged that she heard Davidson use the word for a \"third time\" directed \"at a Black woman\" at the event.\n\nMany have called out the BBC for its handling of the situation, considering the broadcast aired this moment unaltered on BBC One with a two-hour delay. BBC typically airs the ceremony with alterations and indeed made edits, but this moment went untouched.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Warner Bros. raised immediate concerns after the incident on Sunday and requested that the incident be removed from the BBC broadcast within minutes. A source told Deadline that the studio received assurances that its concerns would be passed to the BBC and producer Penny Lane TV during the recording of the ceremony.\n\nLindo even claimed that nobody from the British Academy of Film and Television approached him or Jordan to offer an apology or acknowledge the incident directly after. While speaking to Vanity Fair at a Warner Brothers' after-party, Lindo said that he and Jordan \"did what we had to do\" when they were on stage, but added that he wishes \"someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, BBC removed the show from its streaming platform, iPlayer, and announced plans to re-edit and cut this moment.\n\nThe British Academy of Film and Television also took \"full responsibility\" for the incident in a statement shared with EW, which read, \"We take the duty of care to all our guests very seriously and start from a position of inclusion. \"\n\nThe British Academy went on to \"apologize unreservedly\" to Jordan and Lindo, thanking them for \"their incredible dignity and professionalism.\"\n\nIt concluded, \"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologize to all. We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\"\n\nDavidson addressed the incident on Monday, sharing a statement that reiterated that his verbal tics and uncontrollable swearing, which are symptoms of Tourette's, are involuntary. He stated that he is and always has been \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I have spent my life trying to support and empower the Tourette’s community and to teach empathy, kindness and understanding from others and I will continue to do so.\"\n\nDavidson additionally noted that he \"chose to leave the auditorium early\" of his own volition in acknowledgement of \"the distress my tics were causing.\"\n\nEW has reached out to representatives for Davidson, Cumming, Jordan, and Lindo for comment.",

    "title": "Anthropic Drops Flagship Safety Pledge",
    "description": "In an abrupt shift, the company may release future AI models without ironclad safety guarantees",
    "fullText": "Anthropic, the wildly successful AI company that has cast itself as the most safety-conscious of the top research labs, is dropping the central pledge of its flagship safety policy, company officials tell TIME.\n\nIn 2023, Anthropic committed to never train an AI system unless it could guarantee in advance that the company’s safety measures were adequate. For years, its leaders touted that promise—the central pillar of their Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)—as evidence that they are a responsible company that would withstand market incentives to rush to develop a potentially dangerous technology.\n\nBut in recent months the company decided to radically overhaul the RSP. That decision included scrapping the promise to not release AI models if Anthropic can’t guarantee proper risk mitigations in advance.\n\n“We felt that it wouldn't actually help anyone for us to stop training AI models,” Anthropic’s chief science officer Jared Kaplan told TIME in an exclusive interview. “We didn't really feel, with the rapid advance of AI, that it made sense for us to make unilateral commitments … if competitors are blazing ahead.”\n\nThe new version of the policy, which TIME reviewed, includes commitments to be more transparent about the safety risks of AI, including making additional disclosures about how Anthropic’s own models fare in safety testing. It commits to matching or surpassing the safety efforts of competitors. And it promises to “delay” Anthropic’s AI development if leaders both consider Anthropic to be leader of the AI race and think the risks of catastrophe to be significant.\n\nBut overall, the change to the RSP leaves Anthropic far less constrained by its own safety policies, which previously categorically barred it from training models above a certain level if appropriate safety measures weren’t already in place.\n\nThe change comes as Anthropic, previously considered to be behind OpenAI in the AI race, rides the high of a string of technological and commercial successes. Its Claude models, especially the software-writing tool Claude Code, have won legions of devoted fans. In February, Anthropic raised $30 billion in new investments, valuing it at some $380 billion, and reported that its annualized revenue was growing at a rate of 10x per year. The company’s core business model of selling direct to businesses is seen by many investors as more credible than OpenAI’s main strategy of monetizing a vast consumer user base.\n\nKaplan, the Anthropic executive and co-founder, denied the company’s decision to change course was a capitulation to market incentives as the race for superintelligence accelerates. He framed it instead as a pragmatic response to emerging political and scientific realities. “I don’t think we’re making any kind of U-turn,” Kaplan says.\n\nWhen Anthropic introduced the RSP in 2023, Kaplan says, the company hoped it would encourage rivals to adopt similar measures. (No rivals made quite as overt a promise to pause AI development, but many published lengthy reports detailing their plans to mitigate risk, which Kaplan chalks up as Anthropic exerting a good influence on the industry.) Executives also hoped the approach might eventually serve as a blueprint for binding national regulations or even international treaties, Kaplan claims.\n\nBut those regulations never materialized. Instead, the Trump Administration has endorsed a let-it-rip attitude to AI development, even going so far as to attempt to nullify state regulations. No federal AI law is on the horizon. And while a global governance framework may have seemed possible in 2023, three years later it has become clear that door has closed. Meanwhile, competition for AI supremacy—between companies but also between nations—has only intensified.\n\nTo make matters worse, the science of AI evaluations has proven more complicated than Anthropic expected when it first crafted the RSP. The arrival of powerful new models meant that, in 2025, Anthropic announced it could not rule out the possibility of these models facilitating a bio-terrorist attack. But while they couldn’t rule it out, they also lacked strong scientific evidence that models did pose that kind of danger, which made it difficult to convince governments and rivals of what they saw as the need to act carefully. What the company had previously imagined might look like a bright red line was instead coming into focus as a fuzzy gradient.\n\nFor nearly a year, Anthropic executives discussed ways to reshape their flagship safety policy to match this new environment, Kaplan says. One point they kept coming back to was their founding premise: the idea that to do proper AI safety research, they had to build models at the frontier of capability—even though doing so might accelerate the arrival of the dangers they feared.\n\nIn February, according to Kaplan, Amodei decided that keeping the company from training new models while competitors raced ahead would be helpful to nobody. “If one AI developer paused development to implement safety measures while others moved forward training and deploying AI systems without strong mitigations, that could result in a world that is less safe,” the new version of the RSP, approved unanimously by Amodei and Anthropic’s board, states in its introduction. “The developers with the weakest protections would set the pace, and responsible developers would lose their ability to do safety research.”\n\nChris Painter, the director of policy at METR, a nonprofit focused on evaluating AI models for risky behavior, reviewed an early draft of the policy with Anthropic’s permission. He says the change is understandable — but also a bearish signal for the world’s ability to navigate potential AI catastrophes. The change to the RSP shows Anthropic “believes it needs to shift into triage mode with its safety plans, because methods to assess and mitigate risk are not keeping up with the pace of capabilities,” Painter tells TIME. “This is more evidence that society is not prepared for the potential catastrophic risks posed by AI.”\n\nAnthropic argues the retooled RSP is designed to keep the biggest benefits of the old one. For example, by constraining itself from releasing new models, Anthropic’s original RSP also incentivized it to quickly build safety mitigations. (Because otherwise the company would be unable to sell its AI to customers.) Anthropic says it believes it can maintain that incentive. The new policy commits the company to regularly release what it calls “Frontier Safety Roadmaps”: documents laying out a list of detailed goals for future safety measures it hopes to build.\n\n“We hope to create a forcing function for work that would otherwise be challenging to appropriately prioritize and resource, as it requires collaboration (and in some cases sacrifices) from multiple parts of the company and can be at cross-purposes with immediate competitive and commercial priorities,” the new RSP states.\n\nAnthropic says it will also commit to publishing so-called “Risk Reports” every three to six months. The reports, the company says, will “explain how capabilities, threat models (the specific ways that models might pose threats), and active risk mitigations fit together, and provide an assessment of the overall level of risk.” These documents will be more in-depth than the reports the company already publishes, a spokesperson tells TIME.\n\n“I like the emphasis on transparent risk reporting and publicly verifiable safety roadmaps,” says Painter, the METR policy official. But he said he was “concerned” that moving away from binary thresholds under the previous RSP, by which the arrival of a certain capability could act as a tripwire to temporarily halt Anthropic’s AI development, might enable a “frog-boiling” effect, where danger slowly ramps up without a single moment that sets off alarms.\n\nAsked whether Anthropic was caving to market pressure, Kaplan argued that, in fact, Anthropic was making a renewed commitment to developing AI safely. “If all of our competitors are transparently doing the right thing when it comes to catastrophic risk, we are committed to doing as well or better,” he said. “But we don't think it makes sense for us to stop engaging with AI research, AI safety, and most likely lose relevance as an innovator who understands the frontier of the technology, in a scenario where others are going ahead and we're not actually contributing any additional risk to the ecosystem.”",

    "title": "11 best bralettes for large busts that are both supportive and comfortable",
    "description": "I tested bralettes for large busts to find the styles that deliver real support and feel comfortable under everyday outfits.",
    "fullText": "These days, if a bra isn't comfortable, I'm simply not wearing it. Somewhere in my 30s, the calculus shifted — the lift and structure I once prioritized began to take a backseat to softness and ease. The underwire styles that used to feel essential now sit untouched, while stretchy bralettes have taken over my drawer.\n\nOf course, making that switch isn't as simple when you wear a DD cup. Underwire exists for a reason, and most bralettes aren't engineered to do the same level of support. I've tried plenty that looked promising but didn't hold up past the first hour.\n\nOver time, though, I've figured out what actually works. The bralettes worth buying share a few key traits: a wide, supportive band; adjustable straps; cups cut deep enough to avoid spillover; and fabric with real structure, not just stretch. When those details are right, you get something rare — a bra that feels barely there but still does its job.\n\nFor more of our recommendations for folks with larger chests, see our articles on the best swimsuits for large busts.\n\nThis bralette has it all: adjustable straps, a smoothing back, and even a bonded cradle for maximum support without the wires. I can convert the straps to a criss-cross back, making it versatile enough to wear with a range of tops and dresses, and I really appreciate that it has an adjustable band — something that a lot of bralettes are lacking.\n\nTo be honest, there's not much I don't like about this bralette. It even features removable cups for occasions when I need a little extra coverage — and the mesh and lace detailing add some unexpected sex appeal.\n\n\"The bonded underband lifts the bust without the wires for a perky loo, and the rounded shape makes this a great non-wired t-shirt bra,\" says Katie Weir, the bra fitting expert and founder of Curvy Kate.\n\nSee more of our favorite Honeylove products and hear more about the Crossover bra in our Honeylove review.\n\nI bought this bralette on a whim when I was looking for comfy underthings to sleep in — and I'm so glad I did. In fact, I ended up ordering it in several more colors — and luckily, there are a whopping 21 options to choose from. It's lightweight, seamless, incredibly stretchy, and my go-to for lazy Sundays and Friday nights in.\n\nThis bralette boasts a barely there feel, making it ideal for warmer months since. That said, it is worth noting that because the fabric is so thin and there's no padding, you may want to use nipple covers if you wear it out. (Or don't, you do you!)\n\nI also appreciate that the straps are adjustable on this one. Since the band isn't adjustable, however, make sure you size down if you're between two sizes to make sure you get adequate support.\n\nExecutive Editor Sally Kaplan is deeply passionate about Evelyn & Bobbie's smoothing bralettes. We've featured the V-neck Evelyn Bra above, but she loves the whole collection — the Bobbie scoop-neck, the Beyond bra  and the Defy bra.\n\n\"Evelyn & Bobbie's wireless bras are legitimately the most comfortable I've ever worn. They're supportive, structured, not too constrictive, and they actively take weight off my shoulders,\" says Sally. To hear her full thoughts, see our Evelyn & Bobbie review.\n\nThe comfort of the bralettes is down to a support feature called the \"EB Core,\" which is a patented technology that helps keep the bra's shape while preventing \"pancaking.\" The bralettes also have thicker straps that help with weight distribution.\n\nThe Evelyn Bra, in particular, is fantastic for wearing under lower-cut tops because of the V-neck design. It's smoothing on your back while giving your breasts a lift that doesn't sacrifice comfort.\n\nDespite the fact that this bralette has no cups, underwire, padding, or foam, it offers remarkable lift and separation. Best of all, it's available up to size 6XL, so it accommodates larger band sizes.\n\n\"I love the wide back band, and the fact that [larger sizes] have a higher center gore in front to ensure less spillage,\" says Weir.\n\nThe v-neckline gives this bralette some extra points in the versatility department, and the front-adjusting straps make finding your perfect fit so much easier. Did I mention that the fabric feels as soft as silk?\n\nBuying a bralette in alpha sizing is almost impossible if you have larger breasts. The band is always too tight or too loose, and the cups can create an unflattering squishing effect.\n\nThis bralette solves those issues by offering two cup sizes specifically for those with larger breasts: D/E and F/G. In addition, the pieces come in band sizes from 30 to 42.\n\nThe Cup-Sized Lace Bralette also has convertible straps and, unlike most bralettes, a hook-and-eye closure at the back. This means that you can keep using the piece even as the elastic stretches over time.\n\nIf you're looking for a bralette that's anything but basic, your search is over. This gorgeous little number proves that lingerie doesn't have to be uncomfortable: it's wireless, has plenty of stretch, and offers plenty of support thanks to the longline cut and wide straps.\n\nThis is a great option for larger busts because both the straps and the band are adjustable, making it easier to achieve the perfect fit. Admittedly, it can take some time to fasten all the hook and eye closures in the back, but I like that there are three rows so I can tighten or loosen the band as needed.\n\nIt's the details, though, that really make this bralette stand out — like the scalloped edge tricolor lace and multi-dimensional floral design.\n\nLike so many other SKIMS bralettes, this one is made with buttery soft fabric that's so comfortable you might even forget you're wearing it. I love that it comes in such a wide range of neutrals to accommodate every skin tone, and since it's so lightweight and breathable, you won't have to worry much about that dreaded underboob sweat.\n\nThe only caveat is that you can't adjust the band, and as many reviewers noted, it does run a little small.\n\nAs someone with a 32DD bra size, it's supremely difficult to find bralettes that fit just right because most of them don't cup in band/cup sizes. If I buy a size small, the band fits perfectly but I'm spilling out of the cups. If I buy a medium, the cups fit fine but the band is way too big to offer adequate support. So, I was thrilled when I discovered that every size in this bralette (XXS-XXL) comes in a D/DD cup size option.\n\nBut that's not all there is to love about this bra: it feels super soft against the skin, has adjustable straps, and features a four-row hook and eye closure for max adjustability. Not only that, but the floating cups are designed to mold to your unique bust size and shape.\n\nAnd apparently, I'm not the only one who's a big fan — because this best-selling bralette has garnered hundreds of five-star reviews.\n\nParfait is a lingerie line that specializes in accommodating larger bust sizes — I've owned several of their bras, and the quality speaks for itself: all of them have lasted at least a couple of years.\n\nKaitlin Vachon, a bra fitting expert and founder of Bra Emporium, says this is one of her favorite bralettes for large busts in part because it's available in traditional cup and band sizes. She also notes that the wide band and thick adjustable straps offer ample support, and it's super size-inclusive — in fact, it's available up to a size 42K.\n\nWhile it doesn't have any underwire in the cups, it does feature some side boning for a bit more structure than many other bralettes. Another perk? It can easily be converted into a racerback style, thanks to the J-hook in the back.\n\nI've been enamored with Negative Underwear for a while now — not only because of the minimalist designs, but also because of the brand's focus on sustainability: they only use high-quality fabrics that are free of harmful chemicals, and sourced from OEKO-TEX certified mills.\n\nThe Sieve Non-Wire is arguably the line's most supportive bralette, thanks in part to the Belgian micromesh that holds you up like a firm hug. In her Negative Underwear review, Insider Reviews Executive Editor Sally Kaplan raved about this one.\n\n\"Bralettes like these are really hard to get right for larger chest sizes, but this one worked incredibly well for my DDs (which are sometimes DDDs depending on the time of the month),\" she said. \"Of all the bralettes I've tested in my many years covering women's basics for Insider Reviews, this is my favorite. It lifts them up without separating too much or squishing together — plus, it's the perfect silhouette for V-neck sweaters or shirts.\"\n\nDid you know that a majority of a bra's support comes from the band? I learned this during a bra fitting years ago, and it really stuck with me — I'd always assumed it was the straps or the cups that were holding my girls up. That's what made this Bombas bralette stick out for me: the ribbed band is wider than most, lending ample support and lift without the wires. In fact, it can accommodate up to an F cup size. It's also thoughtfully designed with a tighter knit in the center and around the sides for added support.\n\nI often wear this bra to sleep because the fabric is super stretchy, seamless, and breathable — but it's also great for lounging around the house or running casual errands. Note that this bralette will feel pretty snug when you first put it on, but it stretches out a teeny bit with time.\n\nYes — but with caveats. Traditional bralettes are designed for light support, so not all styles work well for fuller busts. The best options for larger busts include wide bands, structured cups, and supportive fabrics that combine comfort with reliable hold — especially for everyday wear.\n\nA well-fitting bralette should feel snug around the band without squeezing, and your breasts should feel supported without bulging out of the top or sides. If the band rides up or the straps dig in, it's probably not the right fit.\n\nMost bralettes won't replace a proper sports bra for high-impact workouts. However, some structured bralette styles with strong bands and supportive fabrics can work for low-impact activities like yoga or walking. For running or HIIT, stick with a dedicated sports bra.",

    "description": "The AI boom could bring us amazing discoveries — and massive unemployment. Both scenarios are worth taking seriously.",
    "fullText": "You know all that money and effort everyone's putting into AI because they're convinced it's a technology that will change everything? What if they're right?\n\nThat's a kind of fair summary of a Substack post that went viral over the weekend, and then turned into a Wall Street phenomenon Monday, when lots of tech stocks lost value because of AI fears.\n\nI say \"kind of fair\" because the \"what if\" post, published by Citrini Research, isn't just a \"what if\" post, but a \"if it happens, we're in big trouble\" post.\n\nAnd now the blowback: AI boosters are calling the Citrini post \"AI doomerism\" and are poking at some of its doomsday scenarios.\n\nI'm not here to argue whether any of Citrini's individual points are reasonable — I have no idea how AI will affect the likes of, say, DoorDash.\n\nBut this also seems like a forest/trees issue. Maybe the details are wrong, but the big picture should be a sobering one: If the AI future we are being promised comes to pass, it could have a massive effect on our economy, and part of that effect could be meaningful unemployment.\n\nBecause that's not just a wild-eyed anti-AI thesis, but one that's core to the pro-AI thesis, too. It's what accounts for the enormous investments tech companies are making in AI, and the crazy valuations we're seeing for the likes of Anthropic ($380 billion) and OpenAI ($850 billion).\n\nIn short: The only way those companies are going to be worth anything close to those numbers* is if they end up having a massive impact. Yes, some of the value may be justified by amazing innovation AI could unlock, like wonder-drugs that get discovered in a fraction of the time. But a lot of the value will come from the fact that AI will let computers do lots of work humans do now.\n\nYou can't have the upside without the downside. Full stop.\n\nIt's easy to imagine all the ways this ripples through our economy. And every couple weeks or so, we get a new impetus to fire up our imaginations. Right now, for instance, the market is trying to get its head around the notion that AI might dramatically cut into the enterprise software industry, which is why we saw companies like IBM plummet on Monday. But you can do the same exercise for all kinds of work, in all kinds of industries: Lawyers. Consultants. Screenwriters. Truckers. Etc.\n\nNor do you have to be an AI \"doomer\" to think this way — it's baked into the pitch of the biggest AI companies. \"There are cases where entire classes of jobs will go away,\" OpenAI's Sam Altman said last year. His rival, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, is blunter and more pessimistic, predicting that AI will wipe out half of entry-level white collar jobs and send unemployment skyrocketing.\n\nIt is a little weird to see Wall Street whip-sawing as it thinks through how all of this might go. On Tuesday, tech stocks gained again, presumably because investors have now decided they overreacted on Monday. But I won't be surprised to see the markets lurch again down the line when someone else makes a convincing case that computers will disrupt a different industry.\n\nMaybe Citrini is wrong about DoorDash and right about lawyers. Maybe it's the other way around. But the general shape of the problem stays the same: The more AI lives up to the hype, the more it will affect the way people work — or if they work at all. You can be optimistic about that prospect, or terrified. But you can't ignore it.\n\n*Bear in mind these are private companies, which someday expect to be worth much more when they go public.",

    "description": "The State of the Union is not often a market-moving event, but Trump could address two key issues that have impacted markets during his speech.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump will deliver the first official State of the Union address of his term on Tuesday, and there are a few things investors should be listening for that could move markets.\n\nThe State of the Union isn't typically a market-moving event, but uncertainty around Trump's tariff regime following the Supreme Court's ruling and ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran mean investors are looking for signals of what's next from the president.\n\n\"This is usually a non-market-moving event and shouldn't cause a ripple effect on Wall St., with the speech telegraphed with little surprise or fanfare. However, the one constant under President Trump is that we can predict the unpredictable,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief market strategist Jay Woods said ahead of Tuesday evening's address.\n\nThe remarks are expected to be highly watched, with a poll from Scripps News/Talker Research finding that two-thirds of Americans see this State of the Union address as more important than previous years.\n\nHere is what investors should be keeping on their radar during Trump's speech.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that the majority of Trump's tariffs are illegal, finding that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn't justify the import duties.\n\nTrump doubled down, lifting global tariffs to 15% using alternative frameworks to justify his trade war.\n\nLegal battles around tariffs are expected to continue, leaving investors without a clear picture of what's to come. In particular, the fight over tariff rebates for companies may just be getting started.\n\nAny comments from Trump about his trade plans could reshape Wall Street's expectations and move stocks.\n\n\"In his speech, we might learn more of his intent to continue to levy tariffs despite the SCOTUS decision,\" Woods said, adding that these comments could impact markets.\n\nOil prices have been volatile amid tensions between the US and Iran.\n\nWoods says that if Trump were to indicate an escalation of war against Iran, it could move markets.\n\nThe US has been building up its military presence in the Middle East. Updates from Trump about the US presence in Iran could add to volatility in the oil market, putting pressure on a key input for inflation.\n\nIt might be less of a market-moving update than tariffs or military action against Iran, but Trump is also expected to harp on the economy and his push to make life more affordable for everyday Americans.\n\nThe US economy has avoided what many feared would be the worst-case scenario under some of his policies, but worries persist.\n\nAlmost half of Americans are most interested in what Trump says about the economy, the Scripps News/Talker Research poll showed.\n\nComments from Trump about the economy could impact investor perception on inflation and the labor market, which could change expectations for the timing of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.",

    "fullText": "Bryan Johnson, fresh off a 40- and 70-hour social media fast, says he's ready to put an AI buffer between him and his social feed.\n\nIn a post on X, the 48-year-old entrepreneur and biohacker compared social media to pollution and water toxins.\n\n\"Like other toxins, it accumulates,\" he wrote. \"You can't unsee or unfeel what you've consumed. It settles into mental tissue like heavy metals, producing chronic low-grade inflammation.\"\n\nEliminating social media entirely isn't realistic, he wrote.\n\n\"'Just put the phone down' is as practical as telling someone in 19th-century London to stop breathing coal smoke,\" he wrote.\n\nJohnson said time away from the apps is the \"only remedy,\" but he also suggested that AI agents could serve as an antidote to social media.\n\n\"An AI layer between you and the feed. Filtering rage, removing vanity metrics and translating sensationalism into calm, factual language. Preserving signal and eliminating noise,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I never want to see the raw feed. I want an AI agent to read it for me, strip the engagement metrics that hijack my judgment, filter the rage, and return only what I actually came for,\" he added.\n\nIn a world where AI agents are already proving to be expert hackers, agreeable coworkers, and custom-built board members — as well as potential security risks — Johnson's push for an AI layer between himself and his feed doesn't seem all that far off.\n\nJohnson has made it his life's focus to try to reverse his biological age to avoid death. He spends around $2 million a year to do so, focusing on extreme treatments such as plasma therapy alongside his strict diet and exercise routine.\n\nHis wish for an AI social media buffer also ties into his quest for a longer life, he says: \"I want social media to become a longevity intervention, not a longevity threat.\"",

    "description": "Nvidia's results come as investors deal with a bout of AI anxiety. Analysts say the chip giant must handily beat earnings and guidance estimates.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia earnings reports tend to be market-moving events, and the company's report on Wednesday could be particularly momentous as Wall Street goes through a bout of AI anxiety.\n\nWith AI spending from hyperscalers increasingly under scrutiny, any waning in demand for Nvidia's products could signal a slowdown of the AI boom, which investors have bet big on over the last few years.\n\nThe AI trade is also generally under close watch at the moment, as Anthropic's Claude AI disrupts industries and reorders the list of stock winners and losers.\n\n\"Nvidia remains central to the AI narrative. We see hyperscaler capex as the clearest real-time indicator of AI demand,\" said Lauren Goodwin, the chief market strategist at New York Life Investments, in an email on Tuesday. \"As long as companies continue to deploy capital aggressively into AI infrastructure, we do not see evidence of a rollover in this theme. The foundational layer of AI remains supply-constrained.\"\n\nWall Street is expecting the chip giant to deliver $65.91 billion of revenue, with $60 billion of that coming from its all-important data center business.\n\nAs the market heads toward the blockbuster report on Wednesday afternoon, here's what analysts say to keep an eye out for.\n\nDan Ives, the bullish Wedbush tech analyst, said he expects Nvidia to handily beat earnings estimates.\n\nBut perhaps above all else, investors will be paying attention to CEO Jensen Huang's tone and outlook for chip demand going forward.\n\n\"There is one company that is the foundation for the AI Revolution and that is Nvidia with the Godfather of AI Jensen having the best perch and vantage point to discuss overall enterprise AI demand and the appetite for Nvidia's AI chips looking forward,\" Ives wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nJoe Moore, Morgan Stanley's analyst covering Nvidia, says he would buy the stock heading into earnings on Wednesday, as his contacts in the industry continue to sound optimistic about the company.\n\nMoore has a $250 a share price target on the stock, implying 29% upside.\n\nIn the weeks following the report, Moore said to keep an eye on Jensen Huang's appearances at Morgan Stanley's TMT conference and a GTC developer event \n\nAnthony Saglimbene, the chief market strategist at Ameriprise, said to keep an eye out for updates on how successfully Nvidia is ramping up production of its new Rubin model.\n\n\"Execution on next-generation platforms, like Rubin, needs to give investors confidence that the company is on track with deployment schedules and that lead times are manageable.\"\n\nHe added that the firm needs to demonstrate that \"it can continue to successfully manage an industrial-scale manufacturing ramp not often seen in history.\"\n\nJoe Mazzola, the head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, said to watch for heightened investor scrutiny on the firm's profit margins as their production costs grow.\n\n\"Though AI spending shows little sign of easing, Nvidia and fellow chip firms face higher bandwidth memory costs amid sector shortages, and this could affect projected margin growth,\" Mazzola said in an email on Tuesday.\n\nOn the revenue front, he said that data centers will be the most important driver to watch, and guidance must also beat the average forecast.\n\n\"Nvidia remains under pressure every quarter not to just exceed quarterly consensus, but to guide for growth exceeding analysts' average estimates.\"\n\nSimilar to Ives, Luke Rahbari, a co-Portfolio Manager for The Rational Equity Armor Fund, said forward guidance is going to be the most important thing to watch. Any hint of negativity could mean trouble for the stock and the rest of the AI trade.\n\n\"They're going to have to say that they're seeing year-to-year growth, and that number has to be healthy. It doesn't have to be as healthy as how it's been growing here, but staying steady and growing at that year-to-year clip is what's going to be important,\" Rahbari wrote. \"If they mention any type of slowdown, if they say that year-to-year growth is going to be significantly lower, or if they pull back on investing in some of their own customers, that's going to signal that demand for the chips is lower.\"",

    "description": "Elon Musk's AI startup alleged in the lawsuit that Sam Altman's OpenAI recruited former xAI employees to steal trade secrets.",
    "fullText": "A California federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Elon Musk's AI startup xAI, accusing OpenAI of poaching staff to steal trade secrets.\n\nIn a ruling released on Tuesday, US District Judge Rita Lin sided with a request to dismiss the case filed by the Sam Altman-led AI company behind ChatGPT, citing the lack of evidence against it.\n\n\"Notably absent are allegations about the conduct of OpenAI itself,\" Lin wrote in her order. \"xAI does not allege any facts indicating that OpenAI induced xAI's former employees to steal xAI's trade secrets or that these former xAI employees used any stolen trade secrets once employed by OpenAI.\"\n\nInstead of pointing to \"misconduct\" by OpenAI, xAI cited \"eight former xAI employees who left for OpenAI at around the same time,\" the judge said.\n\nLin gave xAI until March 17 to file an amended complaint \"correcting the deficiencies\" outlined in her order — giving Musk's company a chance to try again.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in an escalating feud between tech billionaires Musk and Altman.\n\nLast year, xAI sued Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of monopolistic behavior. Musk has also separately sued Altman and OpenAI — the company the two men cofounded in 2015 — over claims that it betrayed its nonprofit mission by shifting into a for-profit structure. OpenAI countersued, accusing Musk of a \"years-long campaign of harassment.\" That case is scheduled to go to trial in April.\n\nIn a statement in social media platform X, OpenAI said it welcomed the court's decision and called the lawsuit \"yet another front in Mr. Musk's ongoing campaign of harassment.\" Lawyers for x.AI didn't immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nIn the lawsuit that was dismissed on Tuesday, Musk's company alleged that OpenAI engaged in a \"deeply troubling pattern\" of recruiting former xAI employees to gain access to confidential information related to Grok, xAI's flagship chatbot.\n\nIn an amended complaint filed last year, xAI accused rival OpenAI of violating California and federal law by \"inducing\" several ex-employees to \"steal and share xAI's trade secrets.\"\n\n\"Threatened by xAI's innovations, OpenAI is not merely soliciting or hiring a competitor's employees,\" the lawsuit said. \"OpenAI is waging a coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign: OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI's key technologies and business plans.\"\n\nThe complaint alleged that, in just a few months, OpenAI poached at least eight xAI employees, including early xAI engineer Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive. Two former employees, the lawsuit said, have admitted to stealing xAI's trade secrets.\n\nAltman's OpenAI has denied the allegations, calling the lawsuit the \"latest chapter\" in Musk's \"ongoing harassment\" against the company.\n\nIn OpenAI's motion to dismiss the complaint, the company alleged that Musk and xAI have \"lobbed baseless claims of trade secret misappropriation\" to \"intimidate current and former xAI employees from working at their place of choice.\"\n\n\"XAI's federal trade secret misappropriation claim fails as a matter of law,\" OpenAI's attorneys argued in the motion. \"Remarkably, xAI never alleges that OpenAI actually acquired or disclosed xAI's trade secrets.\"",

Jordan and Delroy Lindo — both of whom are Black — were on stage to present an award.\n\nDeadline.com initially reported that AI was to blame for the racial slur appearing in the push alert. Google said that was not the case, and Deadline has since clarified its report.\n\nGoogle said it caught the mistake quickly and only a \"small subset of users\" received the alert with the unedited racial slur. The search giant said that its push alert systems recognized a euphemism for the slur used in stories and incorrectly inserted the full word.\n\n\"This system error did not involve AI,\" Google said. \"Our safety filters did not properly trigger, which is what caused this.\"\n\nTourette syndrome advocate John Davidson, whose life story served as the inspiration for the BAFTA-nominated film \"I Swear,\" later said in a statement that he was \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.\"\n\nAccording to the Tourette Association of America, roughly 10% of the millions of people living with Tourette and tic disorders experience coprolalia, which is \"the involuntary vocalization of obscene or socially inappropriate words or phrases.\"\n\n\"Importantly, these vocal tics are not reflective of the beliefs or values of the person experiencing them,\" the association said in a statement.\n\nThe BBC and the BAFTAs have faced intense criticism for broadcasting the moment, even though the award ceremony was subject to a two-hour tape delay. On Monday, both the BBC and BAFTAs offered separate public apologies for the moment.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologize to all,\" the BAFTAs said in a statement. \"We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\"\n\nKate Phillips, the BBC's chief content officer, said in a note to staff that another racial slur was edited out of the broadcast.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for what happened,\" Phillips wrote on Tuesday in the note, which was provided to Business Insider. \"When I was made aware it was audible on iPlayer, I asked for it to be taken down. As I'm sure you're aware we put out a statement yesterday morning apologising that the remark was not edited out prior to broadcast.\"\n\nDuring the award ceremony, host Alan Cumming made multiple statements about the language the audience might be hearing. Variety reported that \"shut the fuck up\" among other phrases could also be heard during the show.\n\n\"You may have noticed some strong language in the background,\" Cumming told the audience. \"This can be part of how Tourette's syndrome shows up for some people as the film explores that experience.\"",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Matthew Breen, a 51-year-old podcast producer and talent manager based in New York who's currently in Puerto Vallarta. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm based in New York City most of the year, but for the past couple of winters, I've been coming to Puerto Vallarta with my husband to escape the cold. We rent an apartment year-round in Zona Romántica. My parents eventually decided to winter here, too.\n\nIt started as holiday trips, then gradually grew into staying for a few months at a time. I work remotely as a podcast producer and talent manager.\n\nWe've all loved it for years. I've never felt unsafe until this past weekend, and now we're heading home early.\n\nI've been here this winter since mid-November, and I monitor my parents nearby. They rent an apartment in the same building, just downstairs from us.\n\nFriends who have grown up here said they've seen cartel violence elsewhere, but never in Zona Romántica.\n\nFrom our roof and window, we could see giant plumes of smoke rising a few blocks away. Friends in other parts of town said the explosions were car fuel tanks blowing up.\n\nWe heard from friends, family, and neighbors of two different unrelated acquaintances who were forced out of their cars at gunpoint. The explosions ceased for a while and then resumed early afternoon.\n\nFrom our balcony, we watched a car race down our block with two people on a motorcycle chasing it, a gun aimed at the driver. The car turned the corner and disappeared, the motorcycle close behind, and then we heard a gunshot. We didn't see smoke afterward, so we hoped the car got away.\n\nFrom the same vantage point, we saw five or six guys on motorcycles pull into a mattress store parking lot about 100 feet away. The storefront itself was out of view, but we heard glass shatter, and soon after, huge plumes of black smoke poured from the building. There's nothing left to go inside.\n\nAt around 8:30 Monday morning, people were outside, mostly neighbors talking to each other. We walked the neighborhood and saw one tourist bus still smoldering. There were at least 20 burned-out shells of cars, several burned convenience stores, and a burned hotel around the corner.\n\nThere were a couple of fruit and vegetable stands open and a few smaller local family places, but none of the big chains were open, as far as we could tell. Apart from that, the fires have gone out.\n\nWe haven't heard any more explosions. We've just seen a few military trucks with people in camo and machine guns walking the streets.\n\nMy parents were planning to leave town toward the end of March for the season, and I was going to accompany them and assist with travel. Now we're moving up the dates as soon as possible. I don't feel unsafe here, generally. Sunday was the aberration.\n\nI'll accompany my parents to Denver, then fly home to New York with my husband. We'll monitor what things look like from a distance and come back as soon as we can. Otherwise, we would stay longer. We've been able to rebook the flights we had scheduled for early next week.\n\nThe town is very resilient; we've battled disasters before, like hurricanes.

    "title": "I tried Honeylove's internet-famous bras, here's what surprised me",
    "description": "I tested several bras from Honeylove, the shapewear brand behind the viral CrossOver Bra, to see how they fit and feel in real life.",
    "fullText": "Honeylove has shapewear to accommodate every kind of outfit, from smoothing tanks and bodysuits to sculpting shorts and underwear. But without a doubt, the products I've been most excited to test out are the bras. As someone who has a large bust but hates the rigidity of an underwire, I was eager to see if their wireless bras could offer support without sacrificing comfort.\n\nWith that in mind, I tried three of the brand's best-selling items for my Honeylove review: the CrossOver Bra, SoftForm Bra, and Silhouette Bra. I also tested another one of their bestsellers that I'd been seeing all over Instagram: the SuperPower Short.\n\nIf you're looking for more intimates, check out our guides to the best bras and underwear for women.\n\nI found that certain items run a little large in the band, but not quite large enough to advise that you size down completely. I would stick with your usual size, and if you're willing to order an alternative size, try sizing down on the band to see if that works better for you (especially if you tend to be in between band sizes). You can see my thoughts below on the specifics of each style before you decide which ones might work best for you.\n\nBefore trying the Honeylove CrossOver Bra, I had pretty much given up on finding a wireless bra that actually held my chest up. What makes this one work so well is that the straps are fully adjustable all the way from the band to the cup, which allows me to achieve a customized fit. These are key features for me, because most bra straps tend to be far too long on my shoulders, and as a result, fail to provide adequate lift.\n\nAnother advantage of this bra is that it features four rows of hook-and-eye closures, so there's plenty of room to loosen or tighten the band as needed. As someone who's a 32DD, it can be tough to find bras that offer enough coverage but also aren't too loose in the band — and my only concern here is that I'm already wearing it on the tightest hook. That said, it shouldn't be an issue as long as this bra doesn't stretch out too much over time.\n\nThese are just a few reasons why, on my quest for the best bralettes for large busts, this one topped the list.\n\nI'll admit that I was super skeptical about the Honeylove SoftForm bra — mainly because there's no adjustability — but I was pleasantly surprised when I slipped it on. The soft and stretchy microfiber feels like a second skin, and there's just enough firm compression to make me feel secure and supported. I love that it's hardware-free with bonded seams, making it invisible under clothing, and the bonding at the cradle helps to lend a little extra lift.\n\nThe Honeylove SoftForm Bra is a great pick if you're concerned about side or back bulge — thanks to the ample coverage around the back and the thick, compressive fabric, it instantly smooths out any lumps and bumps.\n\nOne thing worth pointing out is that this bra does seem to stretch out a little as you wear it — which is a slight issue since you can't adjust the band or straps. Luckily, though, I did notice that it reverted right back to its original size after washing. This bra also seems to provide less separation than the crossover bra. I certainly wasn't dealing with that dreaded uniboob situation, but I did feel like my bust was pushed inward a bit.\n\nThere are two reasons why I don't usually buy bras with skinny straps. One, they typically aren't supportive enough for my fuller bust. Two, they tend to dig into my shoulders more than wider straps do. So, imagine my shock when this bra — which has extra slender straps — turned out to be my favorite in the Honeylove collection.\n\nMore recently, I learned that the majority of the bra's support actually comes from the band, not the straps. And the main reason why these straps often dig into my shoulders is that I tighten them too much to compensate for the bra's lack of support in the band. Fortunately, the Honeylove Silhouette Bra fits like a glove, and thanks to all the supportive features, I didn't have to tighten the straps so much that they left indentations in my skin.\n\nThe only drawback to this bra is that it has three hook settings on the band as opposed to four (which the Crossover Bra has). Luckily, the bra fit me snugly on the middle hook, meaning I still have room to tighten (or loosen) it as needed.\n\nIt's pretty easy to see why this shapewear piece has garnered thousands of five-star reviews. The SuperPower Short offers waist-to-thigh smoothing, and despite having a high level of compression, they really don't feel restrictive.\n\nIt definitely takes a little shimmying to get the SuperPower Short on, but that's to be expected with shapewear pieces like this. I was able to sit down and move around pretty freely in them, and never felt like I couldn't eat or breathe comfortably. Thanks to the anti-slip silicone strips at the top of the waistband and structured boning down the sides and upper back, I was relieved to find that SuperPower Shorts don't shift around or roll down. Plus, the BoostBands that encircle the upper back of the legs offer a nice, subtle booty-lifting effect.\n\nThe Super PowerShort features a seamless design, and for the most part, they remained undetectable under the variety of dresses, skirts, and jumpsuits I slipped on over them. The only time I saw the waistband show through a little was with a particularly skin-tight dress that's made with ultra-thin fabric.\n\nThe advantage to a shapewear piece like this is that you can wear your own preferred bra with it, making it a little more versatile than a lot of shapewear bodysuits. And since there are strategically placed tabs on both sides of the waistband, you can attach a set of straps for some extra support and staying power. I also really appreciate that there's a slit opening at the gusset so I can pee without having to fully undress.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty impressed with the products I tried from Honeylove. Some of the pieces tend to stretch out somewhat with wear, but I also think that's to be expected with anything that has Spandex in the construction. Fortunately, after washing, they seem to shrink back down again.\n\nThe seamless bras don't show underneath my clothes, and they're so soft and stretchy that I often forget I'm wearing them. Not only that, but they're remarkably supportive considering that they don't have underwire. My favorites are definitely the Silhouette Bra and the CrossOver Bra, both of which are fully adjustable and oh-so-flattering. The SoftForm Bra is nice for lounging around the house, but I personally feel like the other bras offer a little \n\nI can also say with certainty that I'll be using the SuperPower Short under a range of outfits, from fit and flare dresses to pencil skirts. While shapewear is never a necessity, and sometimes I'm more than happy to go without it, I definitely feel a little more confident when I'm wearing this under tighter-fitting garments.\n\nUltimately, what makes Honeylove's pieces stand out is how comfortable they are. As it turns out, beauty isn't pain.\n\nShop all Honeylove bras and shapewear here.\n\nFor bras, Honeylove recommends sizing up if you're in between cup sizes. If you're in between band sizes, it's best to size up if you want a looser and more comfortable fit or size down if you want a more supportive fit.\n\nFor bodysuits, it's best to size down if you're in between sizes since the material is stretchy. They also recommend sizing down if you are petite or if you have a small waist compared to your bust size. The only reason to size up would be if you have notably wider hips.",

    "fullText": "Some US presidents have more of the gift of the gab than others.\n\nThe American Presidency Project has tracked the length of every president's State of the Union address since 1964, with the timer beginning when the president opens with \"Mr. Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker.\"\n\nIn the State of the Union, which is mandated by the Constitution, presidents typically highlight their administration's accomplishments and lay out their legislative agenda in a speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresidents usually also introduce their legislative priorities in a joint address during their first year in office, a tradition started by President Ronald Reagan. Though this speech doesn't technically qualify as a State of the Union, it is widely regarded as such and is included in the American Presidency Project's dataset.\n\nOn average, State of the Union speeches from 1964 onwards have lasted 56 minutes and 24 seconds, according to the American Presidency Project. President Richard Nixon gave the shortest-ever State of the Union speech in 1972 at 28 minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton have given eight of the top 10 longest State of the Union speeches in history. In 2025, Trump broke Clinton's record when his joint address to Congress clocked in at 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 32 seconds.\n\nIt's a record Trump could break again when he delivers the State of the Union on February 24 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nHere's how the top 10 longest State of the Union addresses stack up.",

    "description": "Mexico is much more than its worst moments, says a travel writer who has made Puerto Vallarta her home base for five years and is itching to go back.",
    "fullText": "After cartel violence erupted across the Mexican state of Jalisco this week, images and videos of burning cars and buildings, shuttered storefronts, and cities grinding to a halt hit the news. Flights into and out of Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara were canceled. Residents were told to shelter in place and to ensure they had enough food and water. Tourists were on lockdown and frightened.\n\nI watched it all from far away in Seattle, where I'm currently traveling, as my phone lit up every 15 seconds with messages of panic, forwarded video footage, and WhatsApp voice notes from friends and loved ones on the ground in Puerto Vallarta.\n\nFor most people, Puerto Vallarta was just one of several cities mentioned in the news cycle, but for me it was different — it's been my chosen home base for the last five years.\n\nMy relationship with this city on Mexico's Pacific coast began more than a decade ago, on my first visit in 2013. At the time, Puerto Vallarta was just another reporting assignment at a beach destination, but something hit differently, and I kept returning. It became the place I ran to whenever I needed a break from real life. Each visit stretched longer. By much of 2024 and 2025, I was there full-time.\n\nWhen you spend that much time in a place, it stops feeling like an escape and becomes the backdrop of real life. You learn the traffic patterns, see familiar faces at the coffee shops and bars, pick up your mail. Routine sneaks up on you; it becomes home.\n\nYou also build relationships. As I watched footage of a still-smoldering flame-licked car skeleton at an intersection just a few blocks from my last address, I listened to voice notes from friends. Fear sounds different when it comes from people you love.\n\nYou don't need to be a seasoned traveler or an adrenaline seeker to feel comfortable there. There are direct flights, large resorts, familiar comforts, and an infrastructure built around welcoming visitors.\n\nPlus, it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous with that broad, blue curve of the Bay of Banderas and the jungle-covered crown of peaks that rise behind it.\n\nFor many Americans, Vallarta has been shorthand for \"safe Mexico.\" Could incidents like this change that perception? Inevitably, for some.\n\nTravel decisions are rarely driven by data alone. They are fueled by emotion, personal tolerance for uncertainty, and individual experience. As happens after virtually every high-profile incident in Mexico, reactions tend to fall into familiar categories. There will be people who write Mexico off forever as a country to visit or live. Others will decide to wait and see.\n\nAnd there will be people, like me, who are already itching to return because they understand something fundamental about moments like this: They're traumatic precisely because they are disruptions, not constants.\n\nViolence in Mexico is real. It's serious. It's also limited to very specific parts of a massive country. Mexico is vast and regionally complex. Episodes of cartel-related violence, while alarming, do not function as a constant across daily life in most destinations Americans visit.\n\nMoments like Sunday's violence highlight a perception gap that often shapes how Americans think about risk abroad versus risk at home. Americans tend to discuss violence in Mexico as though it exists in a fundamentally different category of danger. Yet in recent years, the US has developed its own unsettling familiarity with public acts of violence, mass shootings, random attacks, and sudden disruptions.\n\nThere is no longer a clean psychological divide between \"safe at home\" and \"dangerous abroad.\" We are, increasingly, navigating variations of the same reality.\n\nLiving in Puerto Vallarta has not made me dismissive of safety concerns. What happened across Jalisco is devastating and serious. But living there has grounded my understanding of the city in lived experience rather than episodic headlines. It has made moments like Sunday's violence feel personal without altering my relationship to Puerto Vallarta.\n\nWatching the videos didn't make me want to run further from Vallarta. If anything, it made me wish I were there with the community I love.\n\nSo, when do I plan to return? Soon. I'll be heading back to Mexico in early March, this time to Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, nearly 1,000 miles away from Puerto Vallarta. (Yes, Mexico is really big.) I have no hesitation about going. And, truthfully, if logistics allowed, I would go back to Puerto Vallarta this week. It's not just a vacation destination to me, and it's not just a clip on the news. It is nearly 13 years of memories, friendships, routines, and a sense of home that I have built over time.\n\nLike any place anywhere, Puerto Vallarta and Mexico are larger than their worst moments. Like any place you love, those moments do not erase the steadier, more enduring reality of everyday life that surrounds them.",

    "description": "The UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup said on Tuesday it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and global automakers.",
    "fullText": "Wayve is revving up its global robotaxi ambitions with fresh funding as it prepares to take on Waymo in London.\n\nThe UK-based autonomous vehicle software startup announced early Tuesday in the UK that it had raised $1.5 billion from a host of Big Tech giants and major automakers.\n\nThe funding round, which values the startup at $8.6 billion, includes $1.2 billion from investors including Microsoft, Nvidia, and Uber, as well as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and Stellantis.\n\nIt also includes additional capital from Uber, which is tied to deployments of Wayve-powered robotaxis across the globe. The two companies have a deal to launch self-driving vehicles on Uber's app in over 10 markets worldwide, starting with London this year.\n\n\"We've been learning to drive on British roads for the last eight years, and so this is our home turf,\" Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nThe CEO said the latest funding round is key to pursuing the company's ambition to license its software to major automakers and robotaxi fleet platforms like Uber.\n\nUnlike Tesla or Waymo, Wayve is solely focused on developing software for other companies looking to deploy self-driving cars. It is not building its own fleet of robotaxis.\n\nKendall said owning a fleet is expensive, and Tesla's approach to building its own car can be a constraint since it limits the company to one vehicle platform.\n\n\"Everyone wants autonomy, but not everyone wants to buy a Tesla,\" he said.\n\nKendall added that Wayve's AI driver is designed to be generalizable — the same way a human can quickly learn to drive different cars and in new cities.\n\nThat allows Wayve's technology to quickly adapt to new driving environments and learn new road rules, from switching to the opposite side of the road to right turns at a red light, without relying on high-definition mapping and sensors, the approach taken by rivals like Waymo. It also allows the AI driver to be adapted by different automakers, which may have different sensor configurations on their cars, such as lidar or cameras.\n\n\"Because that's what we've built, it enables us to take this business model that enables high-margin software revenues,\" Kendall said.\n\nWayve says that over the past year, its fleet of Ford Mach-Es outfitted with its AI driver has driven in more than 500 cities across Europe, North America, and Japan without being trained on city-specific data.\n\nThe company is also planning to license its technology to carmakers as an advanced driver-assistance system like Tesla's Full Self-Driving, which handles most driving tasks with human supervision. Wayve has a deal with Nissan that will see its AI tech power the Japanese carmaker's ProPilot driver assistance system from 2027.\n\nThe UK-based startup has been testing its tech in London since 2017, and its public debut comes as the city's robotaxi scene gets increasingly crowded.\n\nWaymo is aiming to begin operating its autonomous vehicles in London, its first international location, this year, while Wayve vehicles will be joined on the Uber app by robotaxis from Chinese tech giant Baidu, which is also partnering with Lyft.",

    "fullText": "Workday is betting on artificial intelligence taking over more work.\n\nWhile software stocks — including Workday's — have sunk recently amid concerns over AI advancements, the company framed the technology as a growth opportunity on its Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\"We're working really hard to figure out how do we improve business process execution for our customers at a lower cost,\" CEO Anil Bhusri said.\n\n\"I think that's where the agentic model fits in. What can agents do to replace human labor?\" he said. \"And then obviously longer term, we've got to figure out what we're going to do with those humans that are displaced.\"\n\nBhusri's remarks came after Workday reported revenue and net-income growth for the January-ended quarter. Shares fell around 10%, however, as the company projected slower subscription revenue growth than Wall Street expected for the fiscal year ahead.\n\nA spokesperson for Workday said that Bhusri's comments were not about Workday planning to replace its employees or its customers' employees, but rather about industry-level shifts.\n\nBhusri said the outlook reflects that the AI products Workday is building aren't expected to generate meaningful revenue until later in the year.\n\nWorkday's stock drop marks another setback for the company, whose shares have slid in recent weeks amid a broader software selloff driven by fears that artificial intelligence could upend the industry.\n\nThe rout began in early February, tipping the sector into a deep bear market and spilling into adjacent industries as investors grapple with AI's disruptive potential. Other companies affected include LegalZoom, Thomson Reuters, and Okta.\n\nOn the call, Workday didn't directly address those concerns directly and instead emphasized its investments in agentic products to expand its footprint in HR and finance software.\n\nEarlier this month, Workday said it was laying off about 400 employees, citing a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. A week later, Bhursi was renamed CEO, succeeding Carl Eschenbach, who stepped down. \n\nBhusri has held the top job three times before. He told analysts on Tuesday's earnings call that while he's optimistic about the business, he tends to set guidance cautiously and aim to outperform it.\n\n\"I don't know if you know you remember me when I was a CEO before, but I do try to be conservative on the guide and then beat it,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "All eyes are on the Capitol ahead of the annual State of the Union address. Below, you can find everything you need to know about how to watch the State of the Union in 2026, including free live streaming options.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver the 2026 State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress beginning at 9 p.m. ET on Tuesday evening. The presidential address typically lasts at least an hour, especially in recent years, and is expected to cover a variety of policy subjects. The address typically serves as a reflection on the past year and looks ahead to the agenda for the year to come. After the speech, Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response. TV guides have the event blocked out until 11 p.m. ET.\n\nThe State of the Union will be held in the House of Representatives Chamber at the US Capitol building, and the event will be available to watch live across most major news networks and several streaming services. We've outlined some of the best ways to stream the event below, featuring international options.\n\nThe good news is that pretty much every major news network will carry full coverage of the event, including ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX, Fox News, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC), and NBC, among others.\n\nYou can watch these networks through one of the best live TV streaming services we've tested, such as DirecTV, Fubo, or Sling TV. DirecTV carries all of these channels in its MyNews genre pack, which costs $40 a month. Subscriptions come with a five-day free trial for new users.\n\nFubo and Sling TV are also solid options, though each is missing a few key channels. Fubo is a good option for ABC, CBS, FOX, and Fox News, but it's missing CNN, NBC, and MS Now. Subscriptions start at $56 a month for the Fubo Sports + News pack. New customers can get a five-day free trial and save on their first month of service.\n\nSling TV's Blue plan carries CNN, Fox News, and MS NOW, along with ABC, FOX, and NBC in select regions. Local channel coverage varies by region, so you should check what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. CBS is missing from all Sling plans. Sling Blue costs $50 a month with local channels.\n\nYou can live stream CBS directly through Paramount Plus Premium, which costs $14 a month. FOX and Fox News are available to live stream directly through FOX One, which costs $20 a month. At $17 a month, Peacock Premium Plus offers a live stream of NBC.\n\nSeveral of the networks' free counterparts — like ABC News Live, CBS News 24/7, LiveNOW from FOX, and NBC News NOW — will also carry coverage of the event. You can live stream most of these options directly on their respective websites, without creating an account.\n\nIn the UK, coverage will be available for free on the BBC website and TV channel. Special coverage will be available beginning at 8 p.m. ET or 1 a.m. GMT.\n\nIf you'll be traveling away from home, you can still keep up with your usual viewing options with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are handy cybersecurity tools that let users temporarily change the virtual location on their electronic devices, so they can access their go-to websites and apps from anywhere.

They are shifting millions of dollars into defensive positions and speculative bets.\n\nThis urgent movement follows a series of shocks that have left the global financial system on edge.\n\nThe market tension traces back to a major legal blow delivered last week on Feb. 20.\n\nIn a 6–3 decision, the US Supreme Court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority when he used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote:\n\n“We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”\n\nTrump first launched the tariff wave on April 2, 2025, a day he branded “Liberation Day.” His administration argued that persistent US trade deficits constituted a national emergency, allowing him to bypass Congress under IEEPA.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling specifically invalidated tariffs imposed under IEEPA but left intact sector-based tariffs enacted under other trade laws.\n\nTrump called the decision “deeply disappointing” and insisted the Court had only limited one legal pathway. In a TruthSocial post, he wrote:\n\n“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs. It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”\n\nWithin hours, Trump signed a proclamation invoking Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a new 10% global tariff for up to 150 days, later stating he would raise it to 15%.\n\nMajor gold giant shrinks as Trump-linked firm surges\n\nRich Dad Poor Dad buys Bitcoin again\n\nViral AI agent bans ‘Bitcoin,' ‘crypto’ mentions\n\nUS stock futures turned lower, with S&P 500 futures down roughly 0.8% and Nasdaq futures off about 1% following the renewed tariff push. Crypto initially popped on the Supreme Court ruling but failed to sustain momentum.\n\nBitcoin briefly climbed above $67,800 before reversing.",

    "fullText": "The only thing better than one pair of Bose earbuds is getting two for the same price. Right now, the company is running a BOGO sale of sorts: When you buy a pair of either the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds ($299) you'll get a free pair of refurbished Bose Ultra Open Earbuds (a $249 value). Or, you can get the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds for $299 and get a free refurbished pair of first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (a $249 value).\n\nI've reviewed the Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen), and they have the best ANC I've ever tried. As the name implies, they're comfortable and offer a friendly, minimalistic user experience that I've come to appreciate after testing so many earbuds. The audio is nothing less than what I expect from Bose, and the immersive mode is incredible, making the music truly come to life. I also love their practical features, like the transparency mode coming on when you take one earbud out. Simple, yet so appreciated.\n\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have the sort of open-ear design that has been growing in popularity, likely because active noise-canceling tech has gotten so good that people have forgotten what nature sounds like. The Ultra Open Earbuds are Bose's stab at the trending tech, and they're pretty decent. But when you get a free refurnished pair of QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (1st Gen) along with them, they become a great option for those looking for an open-ear feel.\n\nThis BOGO deal is perfect for people who want to experience both ANC and an open-ear design. Both have very different uses: ANC is great when trying to focus or really get into your media. The open ear design is great for outdoor activities when you need to be aware of your surroundings, or when you want to interact with your environment, like in an office, or working with people. This is an affordable way to get earbuds for either situation.",

    "fullText": "This is going to be a big week for Samsung. The company is making some major announcements at Galaxy Unpacked 2026 on Wednesday, revealing the next generation Galaxy S Series devices (which almost assuredly means the Galaxy S26), as well as some new AI updates. In the lead up to this event, Samsung is also now rolling out its latest security updates for its Galaxy devices—at least, some of its devices.\n\nSamsung's February security update contains 37 patches for issues the company discovered since the January update. This time, there are no critical patches, but there are plenty of fixes for \"High\" severity issues. According to SamMobile, 25 of these patches were provided by Google, which fix issues with Android in general, while the other 12 were specific to Samsung to patch issues within its own ecosystem. That includes issues for Emergency Sharing, Knox Guard Manager, Samsung Dialer, Samsung's Settings app, face and fingerprint authentication systems, and the PACM module—things that only apply to Samsung's own OS.\n\nNot all Galaxy phones are getting this update right away. Samsung is kicking things off with its Galaxy S25 series, meaning the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. It also appears to be rolling out to its latest foldable devices as well, including the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, and Z TriFold. If you bought Samsung's latest and greatest—at least until the S26 series launches—you'll likely see the update in your Settings app imminently. If your Galaxy device is on the older side (or even one year older than the S25 series), you may need to wait a bit before the patches appear.\n\nSpeaking of waiting, Samsung started rolling this update out to Korean users first, so if you're in another region, you might not see it right away. But it does seem evident the patch is on its way, especially with Unpacked airing Wednesday.\n\nOnce the security update hits your device, open the Settings app, then choose either Software update or System updates. (This may differ depending on your device.) From here, depending on your carrier, tap either Download and install, Check for system updates, or Check for software updates. The latest update may begin downloading automatically, but if it doesn't, tap Download now. Finally, follow the on-screen instructions to install the update.",

    "fullText": "Samsung Unpacked 2026 is nearly upon us. On Wednesday, Feb. 25, Samsung will take the stage in San Francisco to make some pretty major product and feature announcements. Unlike some other big tech companies, however, Samsung isn't being 100% secretive here. The company has already told us that it will reveal the next Galaxy S Series, and while they haven't said exactly what it will be called, it's pretty safe to assume this will be the Galaxy S26 series. The rumors suggest Samsung has plenty of other updates up its sleeve, too, including the new Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy AI announcements.\n\nBased on the leaks and rumors, it seems the S26 series will likely be a small year-over-year update to the S25 series, which is largely to be expected from a smartphone OEM as big as Samsung. While there may not be too much incentive to update from the S25 series, users of older Galaxy devices, or older smartphones in general, may find the processor and camera upgrades worthwhile. There may also be unique features, like Privacy Display, which can make it more difficult for others to see your screen when they're not looking at it head-on. We'll have to see exactly which rumors pan out to know for sure.\n\nYou don't need to be seated in San Francisco in order to keep up with all the Samsung news, though. We'll be covering the event live as it happens, posting to this live blog throughout the day. That means we'll be reporting when Samsung reveals the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra; all the new features those devices come with; and any new accessories and AI advancements you can expect from the Samsung ecosystem.

    "title": "Two New Features in YouTube Premium Lite Just Made the Pricier Tier Unnecessary",
    "description": "Unless you're really into YouTube Music, you probably don't need to upgrade.",
    "fullText": "As Lifehacker has previously argued, YouTube Premium is probably the best streaming service for most people. Ads can eat into your free time faster than you might realize, and because YouTube's user-generated videos can be quite short, they're especially annoying there—and blocking them without a paid subscription is tough.\n\nYouTube Premium is also a bit pricey as streaming services go, at $14/month. Fortunately, the company also offers a \"Premium Lite\" plan that's much cheaper—and thanks to the recent addition of a few key features, it no longer pales in comparison to a full subscription. In fact, the $8/month YouTube Premium Lite may now be the best paid YouTube tier for most people.\n\nStarting today, YouTube Premium Lite now offers both background play and download options on most videos, features that were previously exclusive to a full YouTube Premium plan. The update is currently rolling out, so it might take a little bit for it to reach you, but the change essentially gives you parity with a full YouTube Premium plan on the vast majority of YouTube content. According to YouTube, the company has \"heard feedback about wanting these additional features included in the service,\" which prompted the change.\n\nNow, for the same $8/month price, you can get most of the full YouTube Premium experience, normally a $14/month value. The only catch? You'll still get ads when streaming music and music videos, hence the \"most videos\" disclaimer. Ads also \"may appear when you search or browse,\" but as for interruptions while watching non-music content? You should be in the clear.\n\nEssentially, unless you're a big YouTube Music user, getting YouTube Premium Lite instead of a full-cost subscription is now a no-brainer. There are a few smaller bonuses you'll be leaving behind, like the ability to \"Jump Ahead\" (instantly skip frequently skipped parts of a video, usually ad reads), but your subscription will also be around half the price. You win some, you lose some.\n\nThe only real gap now, at least for me, is for households with lots of different YouTube viewers YouTube Premium Lite still only applies to one profile at a time, so if everyone in your household wants to have their own separate algorithms instead of sharing a profile, you'll need to get YouTube Premium Family, which costs $23/month, giving six people in the same household the benefits of a full YouTube Premium subscription. My husband and I have pretty different viewing habits, so we're unlikely to switch to this cheaper tier any time soon. But if you live alone or you're OK sharing a profile, you might as well save yourself some moolah.\n\nAlternatively, you can also still get a YouTube Music Premium plan for $11/month. That removes ads and allows background play and downloads, but only for music and music videos. It's essentially the opposite of YouTube Premium Lite, and faces stiff competition from the likes of Spotify and Apple Music. Personally, I'd just pay the extra for a full YouTube Premium subscription, which has all the same benefits of YouTube Music Premium, but also works for non-music content and only costs $3/month more.\n\nStill, while adding new features to Premium Lite is ultimately a discount, it does follow a move from YouTube to block people from accessing background play for free. Perhaps this is Google's attempt at a compromise?",

Third, users discovered that Discord had partnered with Peter Thiel-backed company Persona for an experiment in the UK, which raised flags about surveillance and security, and saw some personal identifying information being uploaded to the cloud when users thought it would be processed on-device. Now, Discord is admitting that it messed up, and is trying to make amends.\n\nIn a post on its website, titled \"Getting Global Age Assurance Right: What We Got Wrong and What's Changing,\" Discord admitted that its new \"teen-by-default\" age settings haven't had the warmest reception. The company said that it \"knew this rollout was going to be controversial,\" but added that \"we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why.\" It then reiterated that \"over 90% of users will never need to verify their age to continue using Discord exactly as they do today,\" while still doubling down on providing \"real safeguards\" for teenage users. That said, corporate damage control aside, the company also said it's going to delay the global age verification rollout, and is going to make concrete changes to attempt to address user concerns.\n\nTo that end, Discord is making the following changes to its controversial global age verification rollout:\n\nGlobal age verification will now be delayed from March to the \"second half of 2026.\" Until that point, age verification will only remain active in areas where it is legally required, like the UK and Australia.\n\nOn launch, Discord will provide a list of every age verification vendor it works with and their practices.\n\nAll age verification partners will only offer facial scanning on-device.\n\nBefore global age verification launches, Discord will develop alternative age verification methods beyond scanning your face or providing an ID, like providing credit card information instead. However, such methods might not be legally allowed in certain area, like Australia, the UK, and Brazil.\n\nDiscord will add spoiler channels as an option for communities, so they don't need to use age-restricted channels to hide age appropriate, but still sensitive, content anymore. This will allow accounts that aren't able to age verify to access these channels.\n\nThe company will publish a technical blog once age verification launches going into detail on how its systems work, and will add age verification metrics, including how many users were asked to verify or which age verification methods they used, to ongoing transparency reports.\n\nEssentially, the idea is that if you're an adult Discord user (and you live in a region that allows it, which Discord says may not be everywhere), Discord will likely be able to use factors like your signup email, your account age, and your activity to guess your age. If so, you'll be automatically filtered into the correct age group and will be able to keep using the app as usual. Otherwise, you'll be labeled a teen, and will need to verify by either scanning your face, providing a government ID, or using one of Discord's new alternative methods. Or, you could keep using the app unverified, but you'll lose access to age-restricted channels and any content Discord thinks is inappropriate enough to block for you.\n\nTo that end, not much has changed about Discord's end goals, and the company did acknowledge that \"we know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all.\" However, Discord also said that its hand is being forced in regions including the UK, Australia, and Brazil, with \"Europe and multiple US states close behind.\" In scaling age verification globally, Discord says it wants to \"show regulators that it's possible to verify age without collecting identity,\" also stating that \"we don't want to know who you are. We just need to know whether you're an adult.\"\n\nTo be fair, that still seems to involve knowing who users are to some extent, as you'll still need to hand over some type of personal identifying information to verify, or rely on Discord's age prediction to collect information to estimate your age in the background. But as a show of good faith, Discord acknowledged its \"experiment\" with Persona, and that Persona's use of off-device facial scanning did not meet its bar for privacy.\n\nWhat happens next is unclear. Discord's made a lot of promises, but now it has to follow through on them. The company also didn't provide a strict deadline for its age verification rollout, so its possible it could continue to get pushed back in regions that don't legally require it. However, Discord is also up for for an IPO sometime this spring. Certainty and a happy consumer base will likely make investors happy, but that probably also means keeping regulators and concerned parents appeased. Continue to expect compromises, especially when Discord has already come under fire for exposing teens to sensitive material and adult conversations before.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that Americans can't sue the U.S. Postal Service, even when employees deliberately refuse to deliver mail.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for a majority of five conservative justices, said the federal law that generally shields the Postal Service from lawsuits over missing, lost and undelivered mail includes “the intentional nondelivery of mail.”\n\nIn dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that while the protection against lawsuits is broad, it does not extend to situations when the decision not to deliver mail “was driven by malicious reasons.” Justice Neil Gorsuch joined his three liberal colleagues in dissent.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Republican administration had warned that a ruling for Konan would have led to a flood of similar lawsuits against the cash-strapped Postal Service.\n\nKonan, who's also a real estate agent and an insurance agent, claims two employees at a post office in Euless, Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, deliberately didn’t deliver mail belonging to her and her tenants because, she alleges, they didn’t like that she is Black and owns multiple properties.\n\nAccording to court documents, the dispute began when Konan discovered the mailbox key for one of her rental properties had been changed without her knowledge, preventing her from collecting and distributing tenants’ mail from the box. When she contacted the local post office, she was told she wouldn’t receive a new key or regular delivery until she proved she owned the property. She did so, the documents say, but the mail problems continued, despite the USPS inspector general instructing the mail to be delivered.\n\nKonan alleges the employees marked some of the mail as undeliverable or return to sender. Konan and her tenants failed to receive important mail such as bills, medications and car titles, according to the lawsuit. Konan also claims she lost rental income because some tenants moved out due to the situation.\n\nAfter filing dozens of complaints with postal officials, Konan finally filed a lawsuit under the 1946 Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows some lawsuits against the government. The case focused on the reach of the special postal exemption to the law.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests that Americans are increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump’s age and state of mind.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted online between February 18 and 23, measured the attitudes of 4,638 American adults. It found that 89% of Democrats, 30% of Republicans, and 64% of independents believe that the president is becoming “erratic with age.” Taken altogether, 61% of respondents described Trump that way.  Forty-five percent, meanwhile, still believe that he “is mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges.” Forty-nine percent say he is not.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of respondents indicated that “elected officials in Washington, D.C.” more generally “are too old to represent most Americans.”\n\nTrump’s approval rating ticked up two points to 40% and net approval rating went up by four points to -18%. The former number had  stood pat at 38% in the previous two Reuters/Ipsos polls, which were conducted in mid-February and late January, when his net approval rating came in at -22% and -21%, respectively.\n\nThe president’s approval rating has slipped with among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics since February of last year, but most precipitously with that last group, from 36% to 29%. His economic approval rating has also taken a notable dip over that timeframe, from 41% to 36%.\n\nThe post Most Americans — Including 30% of Republicans — Believe Trump Is Becoming ‘Erratic With Age’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Larne extended their lead at the top of the Irish Premiership but by just one point as they played out a 1-1 draw with Linfield at Inver Park.\n\nLeroy Millar gave the leaders a first-half lead, but the Blues hit back after the break through Adam Frizzell with Millar later shown a red card.\n\nThe result means Gary Haveron's side, without a win in four league games, hold a three-point advantage on Coleraine with Linfield five behind.\n\nGlentoran made ground on the leaders as Pad Hoban and Jordan Stewart hit two goals apiece in a 4-0 win at Cliftonville to move to within eight points of Larne with two games in hands.\n\nBottom of the table Glenavon claimed away to 2-2 draw at Ballymena United with Kian Corbally giving the hosts the lead late in the first half before Paul McGovern levelled minutes later.\n\nNathaniel Ferris gave the Lurgan Blues the advantage in the second period, but they were pegged back by Sean Murray with the game ending level.\n\nLarne opened the scoring on 13 minutes as, after Rohan Ferguson produced a stunning save to deny Kirk Millar, Larne broke up the other end of the pitch and Leroy Millar was played in behind by Matty Lusty and confidently slotted past the onrushing Chris Johns.\n\nLinfield had the better of the chances after falling behind most notably from Kyle McClean who had a low volley well saved before Millar failed to get the necessary power on a back post header. For Larne, Matt Ridley glanced a header just wide from a Chris Gallagher corner.\n\nDavid Healy brought on Adam Frizzell at the break and that turned into an inspired move as the former Derry City man appeared to get the final touch on a Sam Taylor corner albeit it could well have been an own goal.\n\nEither way, the Blues were level but the game turned somewhat niggly and bitty with free-kicks being dished out at great frequency by referee Chris Morrison.\n\nThe game was simmering away and it all boiled over on 80 minutes when goal-scorer Milar was sent off for a studs-up lunge on Ethan McGee.\n\nUltimately, the best chance for the visitors was another effort from Frizzell but his looping volley dipped too late to trouble Ferguson meaning it was honours even at Inver Park.\n\nAfter a quiet opening at Solitude, the Glens came closest to breaking the deadlock after Ryan Cooney let fly from 25 yards, but his dipping, curling effort was pushed to safety by an alert Lewis Ridd.\n\nDeclan Devine's men continued to threaten from set plays and went close as MJ Kamson Kamara met Danny Amos's inviting corner, but failed to hit the target.\n\nThat pressure should have told minutes later when Pat Hoban out-muscled Shaun Leppard and raced through with Lewis Ridd to beat, only for the Cliftonville goalkeeper to stand tall and deny the former Derry City striker.\n\nAfter the interval, the away side maintained their momentum as Ross Clarke cut in from the right to exchange passes with Aaron McEneff before seeing his right-footed strike from 20 yards tipped behind by Ridd.\n\nThe breakthrough arrived just after the hour mark when Pat Hoban converted coolly from the penalty spot after Joe Toole's high challenge on Aaron McEneff prompted Tim Marshall to point to the spot.\n\nThe visitors doubled their advantage midway through the second half as MJ Kamson Kamara diverted Ryan Cooney's corner into the path of substitute Stewart, who pounced to head home from close range.\n\nThe points were effectively secured five minutes later when Stewart collected possession from McEneff under no pressure and curled into the far bottom corner.\n\nDeep into injury time, Hoban rounded off a memorable night for Declan Devine's men after latching onto a mistake from the Cliftonville rearguard and slotting home his 19th league goal of the season.\n\nBallymena almost struck within the opening two minutes when Kian Corbally's pass split the Glenavon defence but keeper Jacob Carney was quickly off his line to block Success Edogun's effort with his body.\n\nGlenavon's best opening of the first half came when full-back Paddy Burns whipped in a cross from the left which Paul McGovern met with a glancing header and Ballymena keeper Brad Wade was relieved to see the effort whistle narrowly wide.\n\nBallymena broke the deadlock a minute before the interval when Matthew Clarke got to the bye-line and stood up a cross which David Toure headed back towards the far post, leaving Kian Corbally with a close-range headed tap-in.\n\nRemarkably, Glenavon levelled in first-half injury time when Paul McGovern kept his cool to drill home a low shot through a ruck of players after United keeper Brad Wade had kept out a couple of initial efforts.\n\nBallymena had the ball in the net again before the half-time whistle but Aaron Jarvis' effort from a Dylan McGeouch free kick was ruled out for offside.\n\nThe Lurgan Blues went in front on 57 minutes as they broke quickly with Luke McGerrigan feeding Peter Campbell. He tried to curl a low shot into the far corner with the ball eventually breaking for Nathaniel Ferris to slide home from close range.\n\nBallymena levelled on 62 minutes when half-time substitute Sean Murray's low shot trundled past Carney and into the net with the aid of a couple of deflections.\n\nGlenavon almost won it in the closing stages when Ferris' low shot was cleared off the line by Ballymena defender Daithi McCallion.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to ... Read More",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to X, the platform he owns, to blast The New York Times over a decade-old opinion piece that recently popped back into the spotlight.\n\nThe article in question suggested viewing pedophilia through a mental health lens rather than purely as criminal behavior. Musk's sharp words have reignited debates about media responsibility and child safety, drawing in politicians, influencers, and everyday users. Let's break down what happened, why it matters, and the wave of reactions it sparked.\n\nBack in October 2014, The New York Times published an op-ed by Margo Kaplan, a law professor at Rutgers University. Titled \"Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime,\" the piece argued that attractions to children should be treated as a psychiatric issue.\n\nKaplan pointed out that the DSM-5, the manual used by mental health professionals, classifies pedophilia as a paraphilic disorder when it causes distress or leads to harmful actions. She stressed that while any abuse of children remains illegal, recognizing the attraction as a disorder could help people get therapy before they act on impulses.\n\nThis wasn't a news story from the paper's reporters; it was an opinion column meant to spark discussion. Kaplan used examples from other mental health conditions, like substance abuse disorders, where treatment focuses on prevention rather than punishment for thoughts alone. At the time, it drew some criticism, but it faded from headlines.\n\nFast forward to early 2025, and the piece resurfaced amid broader talks about child exploitation cases, including references to high-profile figures like Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. Senator Mike Lee from Utah shared a screenshot of the headline on X, calling the idea \"delusional\" and insisting, \"No, it's a crime.\" His post quickly gained traction, setting the stage for Musk's involvement.\n\nMusk didn't hesitate to jump in. Replying to Lee's post, he labeled The New York Times \"utterly disgusting\" for running the op-ed. In another related comment, he went further, calling the outlet \"evil propaganda.\"\n\nThis fits Musk's pattern of clashing with mainstream media; he has accused them of bias and sensationalism on multiple occasions. For instance, he has previously criticized The Times for their coverage of Tesla and his personal life, once even tweeting that he might create a site to rate journalists' credibility.\n\nWhat made this slam stand out was the timing. Musk has positioned himself as a vocal advocate for child protection online. He has pushed for stricter content moderation on X to combat child exploitation material, and he often shares posts highlighting threats to kids. Users on the platform amplified his words, with his response racking up millions of views in hours.\n\nOne X user echoed Musk by saying the framing was \"dangerous\" and eroded trust in legacy media. Musk's history adds layers here; he once faced a defamation lawsuit after calling a British cave explorer \"pedo guy\" during the 2018 Thai cave rescue drama. A jury cleared him in 2019, ruling the term was an insult, not a factual claim.\n\nKaplan's piece wasn't defending child abuse; it made clear that actions like molestation are crimes deserving punishment. Instead, she highlighted how stigma prevents people with these attractions from seeking help.\n\nShe cited studies showing that many pedophiles never offend, but fear of legal repercussions keeps them silent. For example, she referenced Germany's Dunkelfeld project, which offers confidential therapy to non-offenders and has reportedly reduced risks.\n\nCritics, however, argue this approach blurs lines. They say labeling it a disorder risks normalizing something society views as morally wrong. Senator Lee's post captured this sentiment, rejecting any nuance and focusing on protection.\n\nThe op-ed also discussed legal barriers, like mandatory reporting laws that might deter therapy seekers. Kaplan suggested reforms to balance help with safety, such as better access to treatment without automatic criminalization for attractions alone. Despite these points, the headline's stark phrasing has fueled misinterpretations, leading some to claim The Times was soft on pedophilia.\n\nThe online response split sharply, with many echoing Musk's disgust. One X user wrote, \"Elon calling out NYT’s disgusting 2014 piece loud & clear — pedophilia is a CRIME, not a disorder to normalize. No debate. No excuses. Protect kids first, always.\"\n\nNot all agreed, though; some defended the op-ed's intent to promote treatment and reduce harm. A commenter noted, \"If The New York Times thought they were publishing nuance, they ended up serving nonsense. Elon calling them 'utterly disgusting' is blunt but when the subject is pedophilia, there’s no room for clever spin.\"\n\nOthers brought up unrelated scandals, like Epstein files, to question media priorities. The debate spilled into broader talks on U.K. policies releasing offenders for space, with Musk previously saying, \"I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.\"\n\nThis episode highlights ongoing tensions between free speech, mental health advocacy, and zero-tolerance for child harm. Musk's platform amplified the debate, showing how old content can fuel new fires in today's fast-paced online world. As discussions continue, one thing is clear: topics like this touch deep nerves, prompting calls for accountability from all sides.",

However, the board said further interviews were still needed, and it is not known when the report will be published.\n\nEthan's paternal grandmother, Kellie Shone, said any delay was \"another failure\".\n\nToddler murdered by grandparents 'failed' by system\n\n'My son was killed by his evil grandparents'\n\nCouple guilty of murdering two-year-old grandson\n\nShone, who lives in Flint, said: \"Ethan was failed by social services when he needed the protection the most.\n\n\"Now, after everything our family has been through, the delay in releasing the review feels like another failure.\n\n\"Not just to us, but to the public who also deserve answers - and so does every child who relies on the system to keep them safe.\n\n\"When a child dies after system failures, delaying the independent review only deepens concern and undermines confidence in those responsible for protecting vulnerable children.\n\n\"There must be accountability when the system meant to protect children fails.\n\n\"The public deserves clear answers about what went wrong and what will change moving forward.\"\n\nEthan died in August 2021 after suffering a catastrophic brain injury which the prosecution claimed was caused by one, or both, of his maternal grandparents.\n\nDuring the seven weeks he lived with them, he became severely malnourished and dehydrated, and had more than 40 injuries on his body when he died.\n\nEthan was placed on the child protection register after his mother, Shannon, and father, Will Griffiths, split in June 2021.\n\nThe toddler, his siblings and his mother went to live with the Ives.\n\nA trial at Mold Crown Court in 2025, heard Ethan should have been seen every 10 days because he was on the register.\n\nHowever, the last time he was seen by a social worker was 22 July 2021 - more than three weeks before he died on 16 August.\n\nSocial workers and health visitors made a number of attempts to see Ethan in the weeks before his death, but were given excuses.\n\nDuring one visit, on 5 August, a social worker remained on the doorstep for about 45 minutes - because of Covid restrictions - but did not see Ethan because his mother said he was napping.\n\nThere was no answer when the social worker and a health visitor attempted to visit Shannon Ives and Ethan on 12 August.\n\nShannon Ives did not respond to a call the next day either.\n\nAt the conclusion of the trial last year, Flintshire Council said: \"In keeping with our determination to protect those who need us most\", it was \"co-operating with the North Wales Safeguarding Board, who are leading a multi-agency review of this tragic case\".\n\nThe North Wales Safeguarding Board is overseeing a Child Practice Review. It had anticipated the report being presented to the board in the early part of 2026.\n\nBut following a \"learning event\" held earlier this month, further work is needed.\n\nThe safeguarding board told BBC Wales: \"At present, the board is unable to provide an exact publication date.\n\n\"It's always difficult to predict exactly when a Child Practice Review will be published as the reviewers will always be led by the information which comes forward.\n\n\"On this occasion, and following the initial learning event held in February, the panel identified the need to undertake further interviews to ensure that the knowledge that informs the review is as robust as possible.\n\n\"As a result, the publication is likely to be later in 2026.\"\n\nMichael Ives was jailed for life in October 2025, with a minimum term of 23 years. His wife Kerry was also jailed for life, with a 17-year minimum term. Ethan's mother, Shannon, was jailed for 12 years.\n\nBBC Wales has learned there will be a hearing next month to decide whether to increase the sentences of Michael and Kerry Ives.\n\nA spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said: \"We received a request for this sentence to be considered under the Unduly Lenient Sentence (ULS) scheme.\n\n\"The Law Officers referred Michael and Kerry Ives' sentences to the Court of Appeal as they agree that both their sentences appear unduly lenient. It is now for the court to decide whether to increase the sentences.\"\n\nLast surviving teacher of Aberfan disaster still remembers faces of the children who died\n\nI'm a doctor but will never be able to pay off my ever-growing student debt\n\nSon lived with mum's body for months after Covid lockdown let him hide murder",

    "description": "Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao fight in September in a rematch of their 2015 blockbuster, but with both men nearning 50 years old, is it a fight that can deliver?",
    "fullText": "Floyd Mayweather, 49, and Manny Pacquiao, 47, will contest their rematch in a professional bout in Las Vegas on 19 September.\n\nIt is a weird fight, \"a carnival\" as Steve Bunce aptly puts it. It is not one that boxing fans have been clamouring for. Nor were they ever considering how the first fight went in 2015 – delivered five years too late and as stale as feared.\n\n\"Carnival\" boxing events, however, have become Netflix's trademark. The streaming platform values one-off, big impact fights that may have little shelf life but burn bright in the moment.\n\n\"It's not the first carnival fight on Netflix,\" 5 Live Boxing expert Bunce told 5 Live Breakfast.\n\n\"We've had Mike Tyson against Jake Paul. We've had Jake Paul against Anthony Joshua.\n\n\"We're so far down the freak fight road that this one doesn't actually raise any alarms bells.\n\n\"It'll just be two men, way past their best in a legitimate fight that is nothing more than an ego-driven sparring session.\n\n\"This circus just gets deeper and deeper and deeper.\"\n\n'White humiliated Aspinall' - Hearn warns Benn after exit\n\nBoxing has a long history of carefully constructed mismatches. Mayweather championed and perfected the genre, fighting UFC star Conor McGregor in a competitively pointless but massively lucrative bout in 2017.\n\nMcGregor was a novice and Mayweather carried him through ten rounds before bringing an end to the contest.\n\nNormally, exhibitions and \"freak fights\" were confined to the top of some luxury building with the wealthy paying a massive fee to see their favourite boxer up close.\n\nThe great Muhammad Ali reaped the benefit of this custom, fighting Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976 in front of 14,00 in Tokyo.\n\nIrish boxer Mick Conlan believes money will be the driving factor for both men.\n\n\"They are two of the greatest of their generation but they are very old and must need money or this fight wouldn't be happening,\" he tells BBC Sport Northern Ireland.\n\nThis is the sell, an anything can happen event where anything is definitely not going to happen.\n\nMayweather brought this tradition to the big stage when he fought McGregor on pay-per-view at the T-Mobile Arena and people have been following his example ever since.\n\nWith Jake Paul turning the art into the biggest industry in boxing with Netflix in recent years, it is perhaps no surprise Mayweather has returned to get in on the act.\n\nBut unlike many of these weird and worrying events - see Paul v 58-year-old Mike Tyson - this contest seems at least from a health point of view, easy to digest.\n\n\"They are both similarly aged,\" Bunce says.\n\n\"One's 49, one's 47. They've had similar amount of fights.\n\n\"In theory, that's a good thing. They are equal in decay or decline. So they're not going in with a young dangerous fighter.\"\n\nIt is yet to be confirmed what exactly the rules will be, but the rematch will be a professional bout and count to each man's record.\n\nPacquiao has been in and out of the ring professionally and in exhibitions for years.\n\nHe was the oldest welterweight champion at the age of 40 in 2019 and came close to making it aged 46 when he drew with WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in the summer of 2024.\n\nMayweather has not fought professionally since becoming 50-0 by beating McGregor in 2017, but he has competed in eight exhibition bouts since then, including against YouTuber and WWE star Logan Paul.\n\nBoth men will be subject to extra tests as they are over the age of 40, but neither will be expected to fail.\n\n\"The claims are that this will be a real fight,\" Bunce adds.\n\n\"They'll wear 10oz gloves, 12, three-minute rounds and there will be no special rules – allegedly.\"\n\n\"[In boxing] we either have exhibition fights or a real fight. This one is a blend of the two.\"\n\nDespite the fact a fight between two boxers nearing 50 is unlikely to set the sporting world alight, the competitive aspect seems secondary to the product.\n\n\"[The first fight] generated unbelievable sums of money. The gate itself, the tickets, generated $72m,\" Bunce says. \"[But] it was a dreadful fight. It was a stinker.\"\n\nMayweather, however, is a master promoter, Pacquiao is loved by millions – the build-up will be as much the offering as the fight night.\n\nNetflix has over 200m households globally and the bout will take place at the Sphere in Las Vegas which can hold 20,000.\n\nAfter what the UFC achieved visually with their event there in 2024, it could be a completely new kind of viewing experience for a boxing fight.\n\nNetflix has offered a fresh approach to fights, blending a big-show American style broadcasting with big-name expert analysts and presenters and drawing in the entertaiment world.\n\nAnd these are two legends of the sport reviving one of boxing's most famous rivalries of the last 50 years.\n\nThe appetite, as proven by Paul and Netflix's past success, is absolutely there.\n\n\"You wll naturally watch it,\" Bunce says and Conlan agrees.\n\n\"It's unwanted but then people will think, 'it's Pacquiao v Mayweather - of course I will watch',\" Conlan says.\n\n\"I would love Pacquiao to win,\" he adds.\n\n\"If he did, they'll probably do another one.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nScientists believe they’ve uncovered the meaning of some of the Moai stone monoliths found on Rapa Nui, better known as Easter Island.\n\nThe scientists analyzed soil in the vicinity of two of the Moai statues and found traces of banana, taro, and sweet potato, according to research published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.\n\nThese traces indicate the statues could have been used to celebrate the crop fertility of soils in the region.\n\nThe famed stone monoliths that tower over the island of Rapa Nui—colloquially known as Easter Island—have puzzled scientists for centuries.\n\nBut archaeologists and soil scientists studying the ancient Moai believe they’ve uncovered the meaning of the famous statues. Clues in nearby soils suggest the statues may have been placed there to celebrate the fertility of crops in the area.\n\nFor more than three decades, Jo Ann Van Tilburg, of the University of California, Los Angeles, has studied the origins of the Moai along with Rapanui artist Cristián Arévalo Pakarati and other members of the local community. They recruited soil scientist Sarah Sherwood, of the University of the South in Tennessee, to analyze the soil the base of two statues found peculiarly perched upright in the Rano Raraku quarry on the eastern part of the island, where most of the more than 1,000 Moai statues originated. (The scientists suspect that work in the quarry began around A.D. 1455.)\n\nThe team analyzed soils at the foot of two of the structures, which archaeologists believe were erected by or before A.D. 1510 to A.D. 1645, and found chemical evidence of common food crops. The soils revealed traces of foods like taro, banana, and sweet potato, according to research published in the Journal of Archaeological Science.\n\nThe findings suggest locals on the island may have actually utilized the quarry itself as a place to grow food.\n\n“When we got the chemistry results back, I did a double take,” Sherwood said in a statement. Soils across much of Rapa Nui are in poor shape—either highly eroded or leeched of the vital nutrients that help plants grow. Analysis showed that soils within the quarry are far more fertile than previously thought, with plenty of water and elevated levels of elements like calcium and phosphorus, which are essential in increasing crop yields.\n\n“This study radically alters the idea that all standing statues in Rano Raraku were simply awaiting transport out of the quarry,” Van Tilburg said in the same statement. “That is, these and probably other upright Moai in Rano Raraku were retained in place to ensure the sacred nature of the quarry itself. The Moai were central to the idea of fertility, and in Rapanui belief their presence here stimulated agricultural food production.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "West Bromwich Albion have sacked head coach Eric Ramsay after only nine games in charge, with the club just one point above the Championship relegation zone.\n\nThe 34-year-old was appointed on a two-and-a-half-year deal on 11 January following the departure of Ryan Mason.\n\nFormer Manchester United coach Ramsay took over with Albion 18th in the table, seven points clear of the bottom three.\n\nBut the Baggies failed to win under him and Tuesday's 1-1 home draw with Charlton proved to be his last match.\n\nA club statement said: \"West Bromwich Albion have parted company with men's first team head coach Eric Ramsay. Assistant head coach Dennis Lawrence has also departed The Hawthorns.\n\n\"First-team coach James Morrison will oversee first-team affairs on an interim basis.\"\n\nWest Brom now winless in 10 games after Charlton draw\n\nWrexham on march and West Brom's 'precarious position' - Sam Parkin's EFL takeaways\n\nRamsay joined West Brom following a spell in Major League Soccer with Minnesota United, who he led to back-to-back Conference play-off semi-finals.\n\nPrior to his move to the United States, the Shrewsbury-born Welshman was a first-team coach at Manchester United under Erik ten Hag and took on an assistant coach role with the Wales men's team.\n\nHowever, his time at The Hawthorns began with 3-2 loss to Middlesbrough before a 5-0 thrashing by Norwich - the club's biggest-ever home defeat outside the top flight.\n\nAlbion rescued a late point from a 1-1 draw at Derby to stop the rot and also picked up points from goalless draws against Stoke and Birmingham.\n\nHowever, they were well beaten by fellow strugglers Portsmouth and knocked out of the FA Cup by the Canaries before Saturday's defeat by leaders Coventry.\n\nFollowing the draw against Charlton, the only one in which the team took the lead under Ramsay, he told BBC WM: \"The question around my job and the future is never one I can ever answer or attempt to answer.\n\n\"I can only do what I can do over the course of a day and put my head on the pillow at night feeling I've turned over every stone.\n\n\"I'm not saying I'm blameless - I can only feel I've controlled what I can control.\"\n\nHis departure leaves Albion looking for their fourth head coach in 14 months since Carlos Corberan's departure to Valencia, with Tony Mowbray sacked before the end of last season.\n\nLatest West Bromwich Albion news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to West Bromwich Albion content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Snoop Dogg walking around the Swansea.com Stadium to the soundtrack of his greatest hits blaring from the sound system, waving a Snoop and Swansea City-branded towel above his head while the capacity crowd did the same and chanted \"Snoop Dogg's barmy army\".\n\nThis was not a fever dream, nor was it the effect of \"the smell of weed in the tunnel\" as visiting manager Paul Heckingbottom put it.\n\nNo, this was a midweek Championship fixture between Swansea and Preston North End.\n\nThe difference between this and other second-tier matches being that one of the Welsh club's co-owners happens to be a hip-hop legend.\n\nCullen rescues Snoop Dogg's Swans party against Preston\n\nSnoop Dogg and Swansea - the story behind football's unlikeliest link-up\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\n\nSnoop is used to rolling up at some of the biggest sporting events in the world.\n\nHe was an 'honorary coach' for the United States at this month's Winter Olympics in Italy, having fulfilled a similar role at the Paris summer Games of 2024.\n\nTwo years before that, he was one of the performers in the Super Bowl half-time show. Global audiences do not get much bigger.\n\nSo, a meeting between teams 14th and eighth in the Championship was not the most obvious next destination for Snoop's sporting bucket list.\n\nBut these are strange times. Wrexham are owned by Hollywood actors and Swansea count former Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric and US television personality and billionaire Martha Stewart among their minority investors.\n\nIn terms of fame and worldwide reach, however, Snoop is on another level.\n\nFans had been lining up outside the stadium five hours before kick-off to get a glimpse of Snoop, who signed autographs and posed for photographs in the kind of sunshine that will have made the Californian feel at home.\n\nInside the ground, he had arranged for every single seat to have a Snoop and Swansea-branded towel inspired by those waved by supporters of his beloved American football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOnce darkness had fallen, the show began.\n\nSwansea and Preston's players were still warming up when Snoop emerged to an explosion of noise and colour.\n\nThe visitors did not seem fazed, though.\n\nPreston had only brought around 200 fans for what was a sell-out. With tickets in the away end sold to Swansea supporters, this was a record number of home fans at a game in this stadium.\n\nYet the away fans were loudest during a first half in which their team led to puncture the party atmosphere.\n\n\"Snoop Dogg, what's the score?\" sang Preston's travelling contingent, before later chanting: \"Where's your towel gone?\"\n\nSat in the directors' box in a long Swansea puffer coat, which would not have looked out of place on the slopes of the Winter Olympics in northern Italy, this was Snoop's first experience of football's tribal fan culture.\n\nFortunately for him, he got to sample the soaring high of an injury-time equaliser as well, as substitute Liam Cullen headed the Swans level in the 95th minute.\n\n\"After the game, he [Snoop] came to the dressing room, spoke with the players,\" said Swansea head coach Vitor Matos.\n\n\"He's someone that likes to be involved. He was involved not only with us, but as well with the [US] Olympic team. He really loves sports.\n\n\"It's good for him to be involved. I'm happy that we have someone like him who loves the club, loves the city, wants to be here.\"\n\nWhen Swansea's American owners Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen brought Snoop in as a minority investor in July, the idea was not that the rapper would spend large amounts of his own enormous wealth on the club.\n\nInstead, the Swans wanted to increase their global appeal by tapping into Snoop's huge reach which includes more than 100m social media followers.\n\nSome at the club believe that could create business and sponsorship opportunities which could outstrip those they had when they were in the Premier League.\n\nGetting back to the top flight is the aim. After such a spectacular preamble, this first act at least produced a dramatic finish.\n\nNow Swansea and Snoop wait to see what the next episode brings.",

Join 7 million investors using Simply Wall St's investing ideas for FREE.\n\nASML Holding (ENXTAM:ASML) reports a breakthrough in EUV lithography that can enable up to 50% higher chip production efficiency.\n\nThe company says its latest EUV machines use a much more powerful light source to help customers process significantly more chips by 2030.\n\nThis development reinforces ASML's position in advanced semiconductor manufacturing as competitors in the U.S. and China work on rival technologies.\n\nASML Holding sits at the center of high end chip production, supplying EUV lithography tools that many chipmakers use for leading edge manufacturing. The new machine design directly targets growing demand for next generation AI chips, an area that has become a key focus across the semiconductor industry.\n\nFor investors watching ENXTAM:ASML, the bigger question is how this technology shift could influence customer investment plans and the competitive gap with other equipment makers. The reported 50% efficiency potential by 2030 may shape long term capacity decisions across foundries and integrated device manufacturers that rely on EUV tools.\n\nStay updated on the most important news stories for ASML Holding by adding it to your watchlist or portfolio. Alternatively, explore our Community to discover new perspectives on ASML Holding.\n\n2 things going right for ASML Holding that this headline doesn't cover.\n\nThis EUV light-source breakthrough goes straight to the economics of chip production. If a tool can process around 50% more wafers per hour without needing extra floor space or duplicate systems, it can change how customers such as TSMC and Intel think about their long term fab build outs. For ASML, that can translate into a stronger case for its most advanced EUV platforms as fabs push to supply AI and high performance computing chips. It also reinforces why ASML is often treated as a way to get exposure to AI chip demand without choosing a specific chip designer. At the same time, a more productive tool could slow the need for incremental units at the margin if customers can get more output from each system, so investors may want to watch how pricing, service and upgrade revenues evolve alongside unit volumes, especially as U.S. and Chinese equipment makers work on competing technologies.\n\nThis EUV advance aligns with the narrative that ASML’s EUV and High NA platforms support productivity and cost reductions for chipmakers, which can support equipment adoption tied to AI demand.\n\nIf High NA adoption timing or tool maturity proves more complex than expected, the focus on current generation EUV power gains could delay some of the earnings contribution that narrative writers associate with future platforms.\n\nThe news puts more weight on ASML’s installed base and upgrade potential, which is mentioned in the narrative, but the specific impact of higher light output on long term service and upgrade revenue may not yet be fully reflected.",

    "description": "After an immature winter, Harry Brook's mature and majestic century against Pakistan proved he is England's leader for the future, writes Matthew Henry.",
    "fullText": "Leaders in English cricket have come in many varieties.\n\nThere was Michael Vaughan the man-manager and Sir Andrew Strauss the strategist, who carefully planned England's route to the top.\n\nSir Alastair Cook and Heather Knight led through pure determination. Ben Stokes is as inspiring as they come.\n\nIt is unlikely Harry Brook will ever have the poise of Strauss or the aura of Stokes.\n\nBrook's penance in Pallekele - a T20 international century as good as any by an England batter, which secured victory over Pakistan and a place in the World Cup semi-finals - was the moment he truly became a leader for England.\n\nStunning Brook century leads England into semis\n\nBrook century blasts England into semi-finals\n\nYou know the story of Brook's winter by now.\n\nAn altercation with a nightclub bouncer in Wellington, a wasteful Ashes performance and a foolish attempt to hide the truth, for which he later had to come clean.\n\nFew England captains have toured with such oversized baggage.\n\nThousands of England fans travelled to Australia for the Ashes. Thousands more set alarms night after night, day after day back home.\n\nBrook owed them a performance and boy did he repay them here. It was the most mature of knocks after the most immature of winters.\n\nIt is curious that Brook, a man with a T20 World Cup winner's medal from 2022 and a Test triple century, could perhaps have been accused of not having delivered a match-winning knock on the very biggest stage.\n\nHis highest score against Australia is 85 in 10 Tests.\n\nBoth of his hundreds against India last year were in Tests England lost - the second in the fifth Test at The Oval when his careless dismissal opened the door for India's fightback to draw the series 2-2.\n\nBrook's highest score at the last 50-over World Cup was 66 and the previous T20 edition 53. Those doubts are silenced now.\n\nBecause, with his side teetering - Phil Salt out first ball and England soon 58-4 as they chased 165 to win - Brook stood up like never before.\n\nMany have questioned Brook's brainpower during his England career and at times this winter he has made it hard not to wonder.\n\nThere were the drives in Perth and Brisbane and the reverse sweep in Adelaide before even considering the issues off the field.\n\nHis 'beer smash' celebration when making a hundred against Sri Lanka last month showed another flash of childishness.\n\nBut those close to Brook and the England dressing room have always spoken of his sharp cricket brain.\n\nThis innings was the perfect example.\n\nIn 2022 he used a four-month break after the death of his grandmother to shed pounds not because he needed to fill his time or appear on the next series of Love Island.\n\nHe spoke then about how it would help him run twos in the 2024 T20 World Cup, thus getting himself back on strike to hit boundaries in the latter overs.\n\nIn Pallekele, Brook's 100 from 51 balls was destructive, brutal at times, but he also ran nine twos.\n\nIt meant he could both attack - England took 11 from the second over and 17 from both the sixth and the 11th as Brook pushed on - but also go down the gears after wickets fell.\n\nWhen Tom Banton was caught behind off Usman Tariq, Brook calmly took singles off his next five balls.\n\nIt was a perfectly paced innings, showing his wish for batters not to be \"too careful\" does not simply mean whack boundaries from every ball.\n\n\"I know we were losing wickets, but my job was still to try to go out there and put them under pressure throughout,\" Brook said.\n\nThat is the smartness people talk about.\n\nThere is, of course, one other man Brook owed a performance to.\n\nHis coach Brendon McCullum was pushed to the brink by the Ashes defeat. Some will say he has already gone beyond the point from which he can return.\n\nBut in securing a semi-final spot, Brook has nudged England closer to a result that will keep the New Zealander in a job should he want it.\n\nBrook could yet be the Mark Robins to McCullum's Sir Alex Ferguson - granted the New Zealander has a long way to go.\n\nBrook has always been one of Bazball's most devoted believers.\n\nMcCullum is the only Test coach Brook has had, the only permanent coach he has worked under as white-ball captain. He often speaks straight from the McCullum philosophical handbook.\n\nIt was no surprise, therefore, that he credited his coach with the plan to promote Brook from number five to bat at three for the first time in his international career.\n\nIt was McCullum who put the idea to his captain early on Tuesday morning, less than 12 hours before the start of the game.\n\nSome England players, like Jacob Bethell, who was nudged down to number four by Brook's promotion, were told earlier in the day, but the rest were not fully made aware of the plan until McCullum spoke in the pre-match huddle.\n\n\"Baz was the mastermind there,\" Brook said.\n\n\"He had the discussion with me this morning about going up the order and trying to maximise the powerplay.\"\n\nMcCullum's move means England now have a free hit in their final Super 8 match against New Zealand on Friday. After that they will travel to India for a semi-final.\n\nSomehow, after stuttering and struggling to this point, they are the closest side to winning the title. Australia have gone already and defending champions India could follow before the week is out.\n\nIf the co-hosts remain, one of South Africa or West Indies will surely be knocked out.\n\nBrook is two wins from becoming the fourth England men's captain - after Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler - to lift a World Cup.\n\nHe is leading his way, which will bring moments that will leave you scratching your head. Now is the time for Brook to be backed, however.\n\nHe is not only a captain, one sharp tactically on the field and supremely talented with the bat, but a leader.",

    "fullText": "Christian Horner says Max Verstappen and his camp were \"not responsible\" for his exit from Red Bull in 2025.\n\nThe 52-year-old left his roles as team principal and chief executive last summer following months of team decline and internal disputes.\n\nJos Verstappen, Max's father, said Horner was \"driving people apart\" before his departure from Red Bull, while many suggested that Horner's exit was an attempt from Red Bull to convince Verstappen to sign a new deal.\n\nVerstappen, who is contracted until 2028, only committed to racing for Red Bull in the 2026 season after Horner's exit.\n\nBut speaking publicly for the first time about his departure, Horner dismissed any suggestions that Verstappen and his camp were responsible for his dismissal.\n\n\"[Max Verstappen's] father has never been my biggest fan,\" Horner told Netflix's Formula 1: Drive to Survive, which is released on Friday.\n\n\"He's been outspoken about me, but I don't believe that the Verstappens were responsible in any way.\"\n\nHorner, who joined the team in 2005, led Red Bull to eight drivers' championships and six constructors' championship titles.\n\nHe was dismissed after a controversial 18 months that started when a female employee accused him of sexual harassment, an allegation that was made public in February 2024.\n\nHe was twice cleared of the claims, firstly after an internal investigation conducted by a lawyer, then by another lawyer who dismissed the complainant's appeal.\n\nThe Briton left with a £52m payout but he said he felt a \"real sense of loss\", and blamed Red Bull managing director Oliver Mintzlaff and Red Bull advisor Marko Helmut for his exit.\n\n\"It was all rather sudden. I didn't really get the chance to say a proper goodbye,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut advising from the side-line.\n\n\"I think ultimately things changed within the business, within the group. The founder died, and after Dietrich [Mateschitz]'s death, I think probably I was deemed to have maybe too much control.\"\n\nListen to Back at Base on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Jacob Murphy did not think twice.\n\nThe Newcastle United winger had just been asked whether he wanted Barcelona or Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\n\"Anyone,\" he immediately responded on Amazon Prime after his side beat Qarabag 3-2 to secure a dominant 9-3 win on aggregate.\n\n\"Honestly, with this group of players, we will take anyone on. Especially with knockout football, we back ourselves. Bring on whoever's to come.\"\n\nIt was a mindset shared by his manager.\n\nNewcastle have achieved their initial target of reaching the next round, but head coach Eddie Howe does not want his side's journey to end yet.\n\nHe believes his team can \"raise our game and compete with anybody\".\n\n\"We have to believe in ourselves,\" he said. \"We have seen the best of ourselves when we have gone into cup games and one-off games, where we have been able to rise to whatever challenge we have had in front of us.\n\n\"We will have to go in with that mindset again, whoever we get in the next round.\"\n\nNewcastle are certainly enjoying life back at Europe's top table.\n\nHowe's side are the top scorers in the Champions League with 26 goals, and have won six games in a single campaign in the competition for the first time.\n\nIt has been quite a turnaround in the last two-and-a-half weeks.\n\nHowe was the first to admit he was not doing his job \"well enough\" after his side were booed off by a section of supporters following a 3-2 defeat against Brentford in the Premier League in their previous game at St James' Park earlier this month.\n\nThe Newcastle head coach embarked on some soul searching in the aftermath of the loss, while his players set out to \"fight for the manager\".\n\nNewcastle have won four of their last five games in all competitions since, and secured a place in the knockout stage proper.\n\nGiven the revenue gap between the Premier League and a number of clubs on the continent, and the competitiveness of the top-flight, outsiders may question whether that should necessarily come as a huge surprise.\n\nEven beleaguered Tottenham Hotspur, who are hovering above the relegation zone in the Premier League, finished in the top eight of the league phase.\n\nYet the manner of Newcastle's six Champions League victories against Qarabag, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Athletic Club and Union Saint-Gilloise were far from foregone conclusions.\n\nQarabag, for instance, had drawn against Chelsea and defeated Benfica, Eintracht Frankfurt and Copenhagen. Newcastle hammered the Azerbaijan Premier League champions.\n\nAlthough Howe wanted more from his much-changed side in the 3-2 second-leg win on Tuesday night, Newcastle have shown they can battle the continent's elite on their day.\n\nNewcastle drew 1-1 against holders Paris St-Germain in the French capital last month and suffered a narrow 2-1 defeat at the hands of Barcelona in their opening game of the competition.\n\nNo wonder, then, defender Dan Burn feels Newcastle can \"compete with anybody\" at their best.\n\n\"We've shown that, especially against Paris St-Germain, how good we can be,\" he wrote in his programme notes.\n\n\"I think we elevate our game going into those games because there are bigger, better teams at this stage of the competition.\"\n\nNewcastle have a lot of work to do in the Premier League, where they currently lie in 11th place.\n\nBut they are no longer stargazed by life in the Champions League.\n\nEven playing in the opening round of the competition was a new experience for the majority of those at the club last time around.\n\nThis was a stage these players dreamed of playing on – nothing said that quite like Murphy's wide-eyed wonder as he lined up for the Champions League anthem for the first time at the San Siro in 2023 – but they now feel like they belong.\n\nNot only are the squad able to draw on the experiences of their last campaign, when they faced Paris St-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan in the group of death, they have also accumulated big-game experiences in the interim. This includes, of course, ending a 70-year wait to win a major domestic trophy by beating Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final last March.\n\nThat is why Friday's last 16 draw will bring eager anticipation rather than trepidation as former Newcastle striker Dwight Gayle knows better than most.\n\n\"Knowing all of the boys in the dressing room, they will be excited about who they get in the next round,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"They will buzz off someone like Barcelona and that will create an unbelievable tie. To continue this run is perfect for them and they will be hungry for more.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "A Secret Soviet Plan to Nuke America From the South Pole Was Working. Until UFO Hunters Looked Up.",
    "description": "When a glowing crescent appeared over Moscow in 1967, alien enthusiasts panicked—unaware they were tracking a 3-megaton weapon meant to bypass American radar.",
    "fullText": "During the late 1960s, a top-secret Soviet program to sneak nuclear weapons around U.S. early warning radars was mistaken for a rash of UFO sightings by Moscow’s citizens. The weapon, known as FOBS, created a mysterious pattern in the night sky that many mistook for signs of alien visitation.\n\nIn the spring of 1967, people living in the western Soviet Union noticed something odd in the sky at dusk: a mysterious crescent-shaped sliver of light, about the size of the moon from most directions but larger from others. The crescent appeared six times in 1967, always at the same time of day, before it finally disappeared.\n\nAccording to veteran space expert James Oberg at Air & Space Magazine, the Soviet press speculated they were UFOs, and UFO enthusiast groups sprang up across the country to record the sightings.\n\nSuddenly, after the sixth incident, Soviet press coverage of the incidents abruptly stopped. Someone in Moscow with the right clearance realized that the crescents in the sky at sundown were actual evidence of a top-secret weapons test—one that violated existing treaties on the deployment of nuclear weapons into space.\n\nThe “UFO” sightings were actually test launches of the R-36 Orb, a secret nuclear space missile. Developed from the SS-9 Scarp intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-36 Orb was designed to rocket into low-Earth orbit and de-orbit over the United States. Launched in a southern direction, the weapon could pass over the South Pole and then come at the United States from the direction of Mexico, bypassing the network of early warning radars facing north.\n\nThe trip would be longer, but would catch the Americans by surprise, allowing the Soviets the chance to detonate a 2-3 megaton thermonuclear weapon wherever they might choose.\n\nThe R-36 was a so-called “first strike” weapon. The only logical reason to have such a weapon was to use it first in a nuclear war, as a surprise weapon meant to destroy American leadership and nuclear command and control systems. The problem? The R-36 was not accurate.\n\nOn average, half of R-36s launched in a war would land within three miles of their target. That’s not a deal breaker with a 5-megaton warhead, but it does rule out destroying enemy missile silos. Still, the R-36 would retain use when it came to wiping out the White House, Pentagon, U.S. nuclear bombers sitting on the tarmac, and other vital U.S. installations in a surprise attack.\n\nThe Soviet military conducted six tests of the R-36, each at the exact time of day when the missiles were illuminated but the recording cameras were in shadow. The illuminated crescent was caused by the weapon’s braking maneuver, in which the de-orbit engine fired up and spewed exhaust as the weapon turned 180 degrees. This created a clearly visible letter “C” in the early evening sky. This slowed the R-36 down so that it entered low earth orbit, and would be fired back up again later to begin the de-orbiting process.\n\nAlthough the Soviets initially explained away the tests as launches of “scientific research satellites,” American intelligence eventually figured out what they were up to and called the USSR out on it. Within eight months of the first test, according to Oberg, the U.S. claimed the R-36 was a first-strike weapon that used an orbit/de-orbit scheme.\n\nThis would run afoul of the Outer Space Treaty, which was nearing completion and which would ban the placement of nuclear weapons in orbit. It would also run counter to U.N. Resolution 1884, passed in 1963, which called on the U.S. and U.S.S.R. not to place nuclear weapons in space.\n\nThe Soviet Union never came clean about the R-36. Eighteen of the weapons were based in silos near Tyuratam, and later banned by the SALT II arms control treaty. The weapons had long since been obsolete, foiled by the deployment of new, southward-facing American early warning radars and Soviet ballistic missile submarines that could launch an attack from that direction much more quickly. The UFOs, it turned out, were not so unidentified after all.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Federal authorities are barred from conducting an “unsupervised, wholesale search” of electronic devices that they seized from a Washington Post reporter’s Virginia home while investigating allegation...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal authorities are barred from conducting an “unsupervised, wholesale search” of electronic devices that they seized from a Washington Post reporter’s Virginia home while investigating allegations that a Pentagon contractor illegally leaked classified information to the journalist, a magistrate judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Porter said he will independently review the contents of Post reporter Hannah Natanson's devices instead of allowing a Justice Department “filter team” to perform a search. Porter said he balanced the need to protect Natanson's free speech rights with the government's duty to safeguard top secret national security information.\n\n“The Court finds that seizing the totality of a reporter’s electronic work product, including tools essential to ongoing newsgathering, constitutes a restraint on the exercise of First Amendment rights,” he wrote.\n\nThe case has drawn national attention and scrutiny from press freedom advocates who say it reflects a more aggressive posture by the Justice Department toward leak investigations involving journalists.\n\nFederal agents seized a phone, two laptops, a recorder, a portable hard drive and a Garmin smart watch when they searched Natanson’s home in Alexandria, Virginia, on Jan. 14. Last month, Porter agreed to temporarily bar the government from reviewing any material from Natanson’s devices. Tuesday's order extends that prohibition.\n\n“The Court’s genuine hope is that this search was conducted — as the government contends — to gather evidence of a crime in a single case, not to collect information about confidential sources from a reporter who has published articles critical of the administration,” he wrote.\n\nThe Post sought an order requiring the government to immediately return the devices to its reporter, but Porter denied that request. He said it is reasonable for the government to keep nothing more than the “limited information” responsive to the search warrant. The rest of the contents must be returned to Natanson, he ruled.\n\nAllowing the government to search a reporter’s work material, including unrelated information from confidential sources, “is the equivalent of leaving the government’s fox in charge of the Washington Post’s henhouse,” Porter wrote.\n\nPentagon contractor Aurelio Luis Perez-Lugones was arrested on Jan. 8 and charged with unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents. Perez-Lugones is accused of taking home printouts of classified documents from his workplace and later passing them to Natanson.\n\nThe newspaper’s attorneys accused authorities of violating legal safeguards for journalists and trampling on Natanson’s First Amendment rights.\n\nJustice Department attorneys argued that the government is entitled to keep the seized material because it contains evidence in an ongoing investigation with national security implications.\n\nThe FBI began investigating after the Post on Oct. 31 published an article containing classified information from an intelligence report, according to the government. The Post reporter co-wrote and contributed to at least five articles that contained classified information provided by Perez-Lugones, authorities said.\n\nNatanson has been covering Republican President Donald Trump’s transformation of the federal government. The Post published a piece in which she described gaining hundreds of new sources from the federal workforce, leading one colleague to call her “the federal government whisperer.”\n\nThe Post says the seized material spanned years of Natanson’s reporting across hundreds of stories, including communications with confidential sources.\n\nThe Justice Department has internal guidelines governing its response to news media leaks. Last April, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued new guidelines restoring prosecutors’ authority to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to hunt for government officials who make “unauthorized disclosures” to journalists.\n\nThe new guidelines rescinded a policy from Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration that protected journalists from having their phone records secretly seized during leak investigations.\n\nPerez-Lugones, 61, of Laurel, Maryland, has remained jailed since his arrest. He held a top-secret security clearance while working as a systems engineer and information technology specialist for a government contractor.\n\nInvestigators found phone messages between Perez-Lugones and the reporter in which they discussed the information that he provided, authorities said. “I’m going quiet for a bit ... just to see if anyone starts asking questions,” Perez-Lugones wrote after sending one of the documents, according to the government.",
