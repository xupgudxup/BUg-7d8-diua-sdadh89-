    "fullText": "Christmas and the NBA have been synonymous since the league’s inception. The very first Christmas Day game was played in 1947 at Madison Square Garden between the New York Knicks and Providence Steam Rollers. The Utah Jazz themselves have been a part of this great Christmas tradition, playing eight games on the beloved holiday.\n\nJazz fans have fond memories of the six wins and probably have forgotten the two losses they’ve sustained throughout, but which is the best Jazz Christmas game? To commemorate this holiday tradition, The Lead has done its research to rank these Jazz Christmas games from worst to best.\n\nDisclaimer: there are only a select few games that have footage to go with them. Each game was ranked by the story behind it, how the game played out, and what players made the biggest impact.\n\nWhen it came to the most lackluster of the games, the Jazz vs the Phoenix Suns was the worst.\n\nThe game was played on Dec. 25, 1982, and the Jazz found themselves struggling to defend throughout the game. At one point in the third quarter, they were down by at least 20. They did manage a small comeback, but it wasn’t enough with the score being 111-101, Suns.\n\nThe only bright spots in that game were the combined effort of Jeff Wilkins, Ben Poquette, and Danny Schayes, scoring 58 of the Jazz’s 101 points. Number seven is the Jazz vs the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe seventh-place game on this list was played on Dec 25, 1977, against the Spurs (one of the last years the Jazz were in New Orleans). This game was between two 70s basketball heavyweights, Pistol Pete Maravich and George Gervin.\n\nThough the Jazz were never really close to winning, they weren’t blown out, and it was a little closer in score. Maravich led the Jazz with 27 points, four steals, and four rebounds. Gervin led the Spurs with 31 points, two blocks, five assists, and one steal. The game also gets bonus points for being the last Christmas game for the Jazz before the move to Utah.\n\nPistol Pete Maravich scored 3,667 points in 83 games over 3 years at LSU.\n\nIf you took the nation's top 83 single-game scoring performances in the last 3 years(not including this season)you'd have a combined 3,465 total points pic.twitter.com/By7PJ7WoPh\n\n— BaseballHistoryNut (@nut_history) December 4, 2025\n\nFor it being the first Christmas Day game, one would think this game would be ranked higher. However, the games to come stand out \n\nThe Jazz had a record of 11-18, though it didn’t stop them from punching above their weight. What the game lacked in story points, it earned in style points – the game was a slugfest between the two teams.\n\nThe Jazz controlled the first half of the game, then the Rockets stormed back to take the lead in the third quarter. Magic happened in the fourth, and the Jazz squeaked by to secure the two-point win over the Rockets. Any game ending with a winning shot is worth watching. Sadly, there was no found footage of the game.\n\nThe leading scorer for the Jazz was Louie Nelson with 21 points, seven rebounds, and two assists. Maravich scored 19 points and added four assists to the cause.\n\nThe fifth pick barely passed the sixth pick by being the Jazz’s first Christmas win in the twenty-first century. The year 2018 marked a new beginning for the Jazz as Gordon Hayward left for Boston and Donovan Mitchell became Utah’s new star.\n\nOn Dec 25, 2018, the league decided to give this exciting young Jazz core a chance on Santa’s big day. They were paired with a Portland Trail Blazers team, looking to prove their dominance.\n\nStyle points for this game were quite low. The first half was quite close, with Damian Lillard putting the Blazers on his back. He ended up with a stat line of 20 points, four assists, and five rebounds.\n\nOnce the Jazz got control of the game in the second half, they didn’t look back. However, player contributions were quite huge.\n\nDefensive beast Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 14 rebounds, and seven blocks. He was aided by Mitchell’s 19 points, two assists, and two rebounds. Even NBA legend Joe Ingles contributed 15 points to the Jazz’s win. Any game with Ingles deserves to be higher on the list.\n\nThis next game had both Jazz and LA Lakers greats going toe-to-toe with each other. Even though it was a blowout victory, the Jazz beating the Lakers alone makes this game legendary.\n\nThe game was a precursor to an amazing Western Conference Semifinals series between the two bruisers that same year. Magic Johnson had a good game of 18 points, 10 assists, three steals, and five rebounds.\n\nKarl Malone showed the league he was Him with 31 points, two steals, and 12 rebounds. Current Jazz color analyst Thurl Bailey added 22 points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nNot only did fans see great individual performances, but they also got to see a shoving match between Malone and Johnson. This further added to this game’s repertoire.\n\nPlayed on Christmas Day 1979, the third spot is a story full of triumph and heartbreak.\n\nThe Jazz won pretty handily against their Rocky Mountain neighbors, the Denver Nuggets. How they did it was quite phenomenal. It was a tight game through the second and third quarters. With the game on the line, the Jazz had two heroes emerge to lead them to victory.\n\nThe first player was Jazz all-timer Adrian Dantley, who came in to score 27 points and four assists. The second player to make his impact was a little-known shooting guard named Terry Furlow, who ended up scoring 37 points, five assists, and two rebounds. It was the best game of Furlow’s career.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the biggest impact he made on the league. In the waking hours of May 23, 1980, after partying, Furlow crashed into a utility pole, killing him on impact. Drugs were found in his system.\n\nLakers legend Johnson was a pallbearer at his funeral – a stark reminder of how fragile life is and how important the holidays are to see family members and friends.\n\nAt Terry Furlow’s funeral, stars like @MagicJohnson, Campy Russell, Greg Kelser, and George McGinnis were some of the pallbearers at New Jerusalem Church in Flint. See this vintage @flintjournal photo. He was truly one of the greats.\n\n— Eric Woodyard (@E_Woodyard) January 2, 2018\n\nThe second-best game was set at the height of the Jazz renaissance in the early 2020s.\n\nThe Jazz were set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Dec 25, 2021. Having their best record in years, the three-seeded Jazz were looking to show the league who they were. The Mavericks, on the other hand, were full of a young core trying to prove themselves.\n\nThe game was like two heavyweights dealing blows. The Mavericks would control the game, then the Jazz would make a run. Mitchell had a heyday even while being hampered by an injury, scoring 33 points, three assists, and three steals.\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Jalen Brunson feasted on smaller defenders, scoring a combined 54 points. It took a combined effort from Mitchell, the Flamethrower Jordan Clarkson, and the rest of the starting core to win in the fourth quarter.\n\nOut of all of the games, this was one of the most entertaining, with both teams having trouble keeping a lead. It also had great performances from individual players.\n\nIt was tough to decide between the number one and number two picks. Both were great games and featured great performances. However, number one was a better game with Jazz greats playing to their fullest. Much like pick two, the number one game was a back-and-forth conundrum.\n\nBoth the Jazz and Rockets were getting a piece of each other in the early half of the season. On Christmas Day, 1997, fans got to see a preview of an iconic playoff series. It wasn’t until the third quarter that the Jazz managed to keep a small lead.\n\nJohn Stockton robbed the world of a Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets NBA Finals.\n\nJordan, Pippen, Rodman vs. Olajuwon, Drexler, Barkley would’ve been must see TV and the Rockets owned the Bulls back then.\n\nRockets in 6 https://t.co/AEzZxM47rH pic.twitter.com/5ifMVJeO8I\n\n— V̷a̷t̷o̷r̷ (@VatorSports) May 28, 2023\n\nThe Rockets weren’t done and ended up coming back to tie the Jazz 101-101 in the fourth quarter. John Stockton took over and scored four major points to put the team ahead. Kevin Willis answered back with a tip-shot to put the Rockets within striking distance. Bryon Russell struggled off the bench but drew a foul to shoot two free throws to ice the game.\n\nStockton scored 24 points and tallied three assists, while Malone added 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jeff Hornacek made a huge contribution as well with 20 points and nine assists.\n\nNot only did Stockton, Malone, and Hornacek outduel the likes of Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and Willis, but it was a glimpse of a great Western Conference finals matchup, showing why this game is worthy of the number one pick.\n\nThe post What is the Best Christmas Day Game in Jazz History? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "description": "The Philadelphia Eagles could claim a former Dallas Cowboys All-Pro.",
    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles are heading into the playoffs as they look to defend their Super Bowl title. However, the Eagles could add to their roster more ahead of the postseason.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys released former All-Pro cornerback Trevon Diggs on Tuesday. Diggs inked a five-year $97 million deal with the Cowboys in 2023, but they have cut ties after an underwhelming 2025 season.\n\nDiggs has a 158.3 passer rating when targeted, which is a perfect passer rating. That means teams are completing passes at a high rate when targeting Diggs.\n\nHowever, he has shown he can be one of the top cornerbacks in the league, leading the league in interceptions in 2021 with 11 and earning All-Pro honors.\n\nThe Eagles could use more depth in their secondary and have shown an interest in adding a talented cornerback coming off some struggles. At the trade deadline, Philadelphia acquired Jaire Alexander from the Baltimore Ravens, taking the chance on a former star cornerback.\n\nAlexander was never suited for the Eagles, as he decided to take time off from football, but that move shows that they could be aggressive in adding to the cornerback room.\n\nDiggs is a player who fits that mold and could potentially help Philadelphia's defense on their playoff run. Even if Diggs continues to struggle, they don't have to play him over their current cornerbacks, and it wouldn't be costly, as he comes on a cheap contract.\n\nIf the Eagles were able to turn around Diggs's career, it would hurt the rival Cowboys more, which is an added bonus.\n\nPhiladelphia is set to be the No.2 or No. 3 seed in the NFC depending on the results of the Week 18 games. They haven't been as consistent of a team as they were in 2024, but still have a talented roster that could get back to the Super Bowl.\n\nWhile Diggs may or may not get back to the level he was at in the 2021 season, he could be worth signing on a cheap contract to add depth to the cornerback room ahead of the Eagles' road to repeat as Super Bowl champions.",

    "fullText": "Greg McElroy loves NFC East dumpster fire to draft Fernando Mendoza next spring originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza's primary focus is beating the Alabama Crimson Tidein the Rose Bowl.\n\nBut some analysts are already looking ahead, including ESPN's Greg McElroy, who wants to see a struggling NFL franchise take a shot by drafting the Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nEnter the possibility of Mendoza heading to New Jersey, McElroy said Tuesday.\n\n“Right now, I would go with the upside that you get with Dante Moore and Fernando Mendoza,” McElroy said. “I think Jaxson Dart, at this point, is a really high-floor prospect. You kind of know what you’re going to get. … But there’s mechanical inconsistencies that will not be fixed immediately.”\n\nIf Mendoza goes to the New York Giants, McElroy sees him picking up steam much quicker.\n\n“I like the upside of Dante Moore and Fernando Mendoza better,” McElroy said. “Because I feel like the long-term prospects of those guys being super elite in the NFL feels more likely than it does with Jaxson Dart.”\n\nBut, for now, Mendoza told reporters Tuesday how much he is excited to play a storied SEC program, particularly quarterback Ty Simpson.\n\n\"I’ve seen him or heard about him for a long time now. He was one of the top guys. ... Not only was he a great quarterback, he seemed like he was a great guy. And I think everyone he’s rubbed off on whether it was his podcast with ‘Bussin with the Boys,’ I’ve always seen his personality shine through, and I think that’s why he’s such a great leader of that team in which people see he’s authentic, he’s genuine and they want to go behind him. Also as a player, he’s one of the best quarterbacks in the nation, no doubt about it.”\n\nThe Rose Bowl is set for New Year's Day (4 p.m. ET, ESPN).",

But here’s the catch, he wore on a brace on his left arm and he’s a lefty. So he dropped all those buckets using his right hand.\n\n“I missed the first one,” said Justus Kleitz. “I was like oh that’s going to suck. Then I hit the next one and hit the next one. I think hit like five in a row. Everyone was like, ‘that’s crazy. You just scored 30 with your right hand. I don’t think I can make a layup with my left hand.'”\n\nThe Iroquois senior is averaging over 40 points a game this season. But for how dominant he is on the hardwood, he may be even better on the football field.\n\n“He’s naturally better at football to be honest,” said Todd Kleitz, Justus’ father and basketball coach. “He doesn’t really put time into football. He’s just good. I think a lot of it comes from being on the basketball court. As a point guard on the basketball court, he sees the floor really well. I think some of that translates to the football field.”\n\nJustus is statistically the best quarterback to come through Western New York. He holds the all-time WNY record for passing yards and touchdowns. But he’s much more than a stud athlete. Kleitz received the Call to Courage award last year for his excellence in the classroom and in the community.\n\n“Getting an award from an old Bills coach and being around Dawson Knox and talking to Dawson,” said Justus. “I was just like, it’s crazy. I never talked to an NFL player before and I’m talking to him. It’s incredible.”\n\nTodd Kleitz said it’s the best award that Justus has ever received because it shows his character.\n\nThe Iroquois senior is undecided on college. He added that football comes more natural to him. But he wants to play basketball at the next level because that’s his passion.",

    "fullText": "MLB’s history of steroid use continues to provoke controversy as a discussion related to Hall of Fame candidacy. The juiciest debates of all concern all-time great talents who have been kept out of the Hall due to their evidence-based connection to steroids.\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox greats Manny Ramirez and Roger Clemens are two examples of such players who have been kept out of the HOF due to their link to performance-enhancing substances.\n\nMeanwhile, more nuanced discussions on the topic in recent years have pointed out that there are multiple guys already in the Hall who have been linked to steroids, if not officially condemned with evidence.\n\nESPN’s astute MLB analyst Paul Hembekides explained where his line is drawn (during a recent podcast), and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nFor Hembekides, if you were an MLB player caught using performance enhancement drugs after mandatory testing was implemented in 2004, you don’t deserve Hall of Fame entry. However, by that same token, Hembekides doesn’t believe that players like Clemens who used steroids during the height of usage (and prior to testing) should be banned from the Hall.\n\nMajor League Baseball was a testing-free league from 1986 until 2004.\n\nHolding Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens to the same standard as players in the testing era is intellectually dishonest. pic.twitter.com/XNrXMkBtpo\n\n— Paul Hembekides (Hembo) (@PaulHembo) December 29, 2025\n\n“These are complicated decisions that writers and that voters need to make, (and) I’ve kind of made my piece with the fact that if you’ve tested positive, or we have clear reason to believe that you did (use) steroids after the testing was in place, then you’re out for me,” Hembekides said.\n\n“So count me out on Manny (Ramirez) and count me out on A-Rod,” Hembekides continued. “But Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, best we can tell, started using steroids at the peak of the steroid era, and the biggest mistake that they made was being so much greater than their peers.”\n\nSteroids were first banned in MLB in 1991 when commissioner Fay Vincent issued a memo, but there was no testing established. In 2003, MLB and the players’ union agreed to anonymous testing to gauge the prevalence of steroid usage. When more than five percent of these tests came back positive, MLB made a move to implement mandatory testing (with penalties), which began in 2004. This is the line in the sand referred to by Hembekides.\n\nIn 2013, MLB started testing for human growth hormone using blood samples.\n\nRed Sox’s Marcelo Mayer Makes Notable Jersey Number Change",

    "description": "He can also break the Chicago Bears all time yards in a season with only 108 yards set by Erik Kramer",
    "fullText": "Caleb Williams walks into Halas Hall this week knowing every number on the board. On Sunday against the Detroit Lions, he will step onto the field needing 270 passing yards to become the first Chicago Bears quarterback ever to throw for 4,000 yards in a single season, and just 108 yards to break Erik Kramer’s long-standing franchise record for passing yards in a year. The Bears are heading to the playoffs, but this game gives their young quarterback a chance to rewrite the team’s record book in front of a home crowd that has waited decades for this kind of passing season.​\n\nAround Chicago, the conversation shifts from whether the Bears can win to what this game might mean for their history. This franchise is known for dominant defenses and powerful running games, not for eye-catching passing totals. Yet, Williams sits within one strong afternoon of crossing a threshold no Bears quarterback has ever reached. Erik Kramer’s record stands as a measuring stick for modern Bears passing. Williams now has the chance to clear it while also pushing into a new tier with 4,000 yards in the same season.​\n\nOn the practice field, teammates keep the mood loose. Receivers talk about which route might carry the record-breaking yards, picturing a deep post, a back shoulder throw on the sideline, or a catch and run that sends the stadium into a frenzy. Linemen focus on their assignments, knowing that every clean pocket buys Williams the time he needs to let routes develop and chase both the win and the milestones at once.\n\nThe coaches emphasize that the goal remains simple. Play winning football first, and let the records follow. When Williams jogs out of the tunnel on Sunday, the stakes will be clear without ever being spoken. With each completion, the gap to 4,000 yards and to Kramer’s record will shrink, and an entire fan base will track the totals as closely as the score. One game against the Lions now offers more than just a tune-up before the playoffs. It gives Caleb Williams the chance to step fully into Bears history, to become the quarterback who finally drags the franchise into the 4,000-yard era and sets a new single-season standard for everyone who comes after him.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Caleb Williams needs 270 yards to be the first Bear to reach 4k yards",

    "description": "Carragher claimed that both Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz were better striker options than summer signing Gyokeres after the Gunners’ big win over Aston Villa",
    "fullText": "Ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has suggested that either Gabriel Jesus or Kai Havertz should be Arsenal’s starting striker from now on, labelling both options “a better player” than Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nGyokeres joined the club for £55m in the summer in a signing that many felt could prove to be the final piece of the jigsaw for Arsenal, though the Sweden striker hasn’t quite managed to settle at the Emirates, scoring just five goals in 17 Premier League appearances so far.\n\nThe 27-year-old has become the focus of an Arsenal attack that hasn’t quite clicked in recent weeks, and he was once again fairly ineffective despite the Gunners’s dominant performance in the 4-1 rout of Aston Villa.\n\nTo make matters worse, Jesus came on as a substitute for Gyokeres and scored the goal of the game late on, stroking a brilliant effort into the far corner to make it 4-0.\n\nAnd speaking after the match, Sky Sports pundit Carragher said that he is “a huge fan of Jesus”, before adding that either the Brazilian or Havertz “should be starting” ahead of Gyokeres.\n\n“The one negative out of tonight for Arsenal, is that Gyokeres should not be starting, when they have players like this,” explained Carragher.\n\n“In a couple of games time, when Jesus is a bit more up to speed, he should be starting. He's a better player than Gyokeres - that's a fact.”\n\nJesus and Havertz have recently returned from long injury lay-offs, with the former netting his first goal in over a year against Villa after recently ending his recovery from ACL surgery.\n\nWhile Gyokeres was signed to spearhead the Arsenal attack after a promising spell at Sporting, the Sweden international has failed to hit the ground running in England, and Carragher claimed that Jesus and Havertz are both better options to lead the Arsenal line at present.\n\n“There's been questions in the past asking if [Jesus] is good enough for Arsenal to go and win the league,” added the former England international. “But right now he's better than the guy they brought in who they thought was going to win them the league.\n\n“Him or Havertz as the central striker is a better player than Gyokeres. He lacks finesse and quality when you think of what they've got on the bench. I think Arsenal need to improve on Gyokeres and they've got players that can in Jesus.”",

    "fullText": "The Indiana high school boys basketball upcoming 2025-26 season like others across the country, is in full swing as the winter sports seasons have commenced.\n\nContinuing to top Indiana high school boys basketball are the Fishers Tigers, which is off to a sizzling 8-0 start after going 30-1 last season. The Tigers are back with plenty of talent dotted along their roster, but who else should we watch for out of Indiana when it comes to the state’s top teams?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a look at the top 25 high school boys basketball teams in the state of Indiana according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Dec. 30.\n\nFishers Tigers last year were just a bucket away from repeating as IHSA Class 4A state champions, falling in a heartbreaking, 67-66 decision to Jeffersonville. The team returns plenty of talent from a year ago as they continue to hold the No. 1 spot in our second set of Indiana high school boys basketball rankings. The Tigers brings back a pair of junior guards in Jason Gardner Jr. and Cooper Zachary, whom combined for around 26 points per game a season ago. Coming off a 30-1 season, the Tigers remain the team to beat as they’re off to a strong start through eight games. Gardner Jr. leads the team currently in scoring at 21.3 points per contest.\n\nSpeaking of another Indiana high school boys basketball team that last year ended up falling to Jeffersonville along the way in the Class 4A state tournament was Lawrence North, as they fell to the eventual champions in a 56-49 decision. The Wildcats bring back one of the state’s top power forwards in senior Brennan Miller, who averaged 13.4 points and 8.6 rebounds last season. Also watch out for forwards Kai McGrew and Kenneth Lampley, respectively. Lawrence North has yet to drop a contest as of yet through six games.\n\nCarmel started off the season with a football-like score of a game against No. 12 Zionsville, winning 35-28 to tip things off. Since then, the Greyhounds have been off and running through the Indiana high school boys basketball season so far. The month of January is certainly going to test the mettle of Carmel as they have matchups slated against No. 4 Cathedral (Jan. 3), No. 5 Plainfield (Jan. 16) and No. 20 Westfield (Jan. 10), respectively.\n\nThe Cathedral Fighting Irish dropped down a spot in our first set of regular season rankings in Indiana as they started the preseason at No. 3. Detroit Mercy commitment Keaton Aldridge, who averaged 11.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists last season, is back in the lineup. Another key player that’s back for the Fighting Irish this season is guard Julien Smith, who was second on the team in scoring in 2024-25 at 13.5 points per game. Both players have come on strong this season for the Fighting Irish as Aldridge leads the team with 18.5 points, 9.5 rebounds a game and Smith is averaging 18.3, respectively.\n\nRounding out the Top 5 of the Indiana high school boys basketball rankings is the Plainfield Quakers, which went 16-8 in the 2024-25 season. The Quakers have a solid roster coming back that includes senior power forward Noah Smith, who is committed to DePaul. The three-star forward has provided the punch in the front court for Plainfield as Smith is averaging 20.6 points and 8.6 rebounds per contest this winter.\n\n6. Crown Point Bulldogs (6-0)\n7. Mt Vernon Marauders (10-2)\n8. Pike Red Devils (7-1)\n9. La Lumiere School Lakers (3-1)\n10. Ben Davis Giants (4-2)\n\n11. Noblesville Millers (5-4)\n12. Zionsville Eagles (5-4)\n13. Silver Creek Dragons (8-1)\n14. Crispus Attucks Tigers (5-2)\n15. Roncalli Royals (6-0)\n\n16. Riley Wildcats (5-0)\n17. Penn Kingsmen (5-2)\n18. Brownsburg Bulldogs (6-3)\n19. North Huskies (6-0)\n20. Westfield Shamrocks (3-3)\n\n21. Saint Joseph Huskies (7-3)\n22. North Central Panthers (4-3)\n23. Homestead Spartans (7-2)\n24. Northridge Raiders (7-1)\n25. Portage Indians (10-0)\n\nFor Indiana high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — It’s a tall task to showcase what makes the current Highmark Stadium special, but the tour guides who are trained to share this knowledge make it look easy.\n\n“It’s a very special and privileged experience to be able to give people the first opportunity to walk into this building, the first opportunity to walk out on that field. It’s very special,” said Kevin Loewke.\n\nDid you know Highmark is one of the most difficult stadiums to kick a field goal because of the jet stream? What about the fact that there’s a cemetery sitting just beyond Gate 7?\n\nLoewke and Ken Kern have been guiding groups through more than five decades of history since the tour guide program began less than 10 years ago.\n\n“Giving a tour, part of it is putting on a show. I think we both have the opportunity to give our fans when they come in for a tour a little bit of a show, and not only share our stories about the stadium, but — more importantly, particularly in the last couple of years — we want to hear the stories the fans want to share,” Kern said.\n\nThe two told WIVB News 4 that each individual guide has their own routine, building upon it over the years by learning from one another.\n\n“Over the many years we’ve done it, we’ve added to our stories, we’ve made our tours more interesting,” Loewke said.\n\nAt the start of the month, the guides receive a schedule outlining tour dates. On the day a group is set to come in, the guide arrives early to make sure all spots are open to see — including locker rooms, the broadcast booths and the field. Loewke and Kern said recently they’ve started comparing the current stadium with the new one across the street.\n\nAs the final season comes to an end, both Kern and Loewke say it’s bittersweet — but they’re looking ahead at what comes next when the team moves across the street.\n\n“I was here last week for a tour — I thought it was my last tour,” Kern said. “I got here a little early and I was taking pictures of everything because, when it’s all said and done, I might want to go back and put my own little photo album together of the tours we used to do when we were here. It’s definitely bittersweet. We’re going to miss this place a lot. But, you know what, that place across the street — we can’t wait to get in there. We just can’t wait — it’s going to be fabulous.”\n\nTune into the News 4 special “‘Where Else Would You Rather Be?’: The Final Season” at 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 31 on the CW23, at 5 p.m. on Jan. 1 on WIVB, at 7 p.m. on Jan. 1 on the CW23, or stream the special on WIVB+.\n\nMarlee Tuskes is an award-winning anchor and reporter who has been part of the News 4 team since 2019. See more of her work here and follow her on Twitter.",

    "fullText": "Cowboys listed as ideal landing spot for veteran running back in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter missing out on postseason play for a second consecutive season, the Dallas Cowboys will have some major questions to answer over the offseason, including what they plan to do at the running back position.\n\nThe Cowboys got some surprisingly productive play from Javonte Williams this season. The fifth-year back has started in all 16 games for Dallas on the current campaign and tallied 1,201 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. He also has 35 receptions for 137 yards and two more TDs.\n\nUnfortunately for Dallas, Williams is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and his productive play over the course of the campaign may have elevated him out of the Cowboys’ price range, which would leave them seeking a replacement.\n\nThat’s where veteran back J.K. Dobbins could come in. Like Williams, Dobbins is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and he could prove to be a realistic, affordable target for Dallas.\n\nFor those reasons, the Cowboys were recently listed as an ideal landing spot for Dobbins by Alex Kay of Bleacher Report.\n\n“With Dobbins missing multiple games in all six of his NFL seasons—including all of the 2021 campaign and almost all of 2023—it'll be tough for him to earn any sort of long-term deal from a club,” Kay wrote. “… Dobbins will be well worth rolling the dice on for a cash-strapped club like the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMore Dallas Cowboys news: Dak Prescott explains why he wants to play in regular season finale for Cowboys\n\n\"The team could be priced out of retaining Javonte Williams and will want to make up that lost production by coming to terms on a cheap, incentive-laden deal with Dobbins.”\n\nWhen it comes to Dobbins, health has always been a consistent concern as he’s missed a chunk of time in each of the last four seasons. He started strong in Denver this season before eventually being placed on the IR with a foot injury. Prior to the injury though, Dobbins had a solid season for the Broncos, tallying 772 rushing yads and four touchdowns in 10 appearances.\n\nHe’s still just 27 years old, so he should still have plenty of gas left in the tank, as long as he can stay on the field. Given their other options, Dobbins could certainly be worth a flyer for the Cowboys, who could also look to add a running back in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft.",

    "fullText": "PITTSBURGH, Pa. (BLACK AND GOLD NATION) – The last time T.J. Watt suited up in a game was on Dec. 7 against Baltimore. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin is ‘optimistic’ that his captain can play in round two against the Ravens.\n\n“I’m open to utilizing him in any way that’s appropriate relative to his availability,” Tomlin said. “But certainly I’m more optimistic this week than I have been in previous weeks.”\n\nJerome Bettis looks back on ‘storybook ending’ to career\n\nWatt has missed the past three games due to a partially collapsed lung, which was caused by a dry needling treatment session at the team’s facility.\n\nLast week, he participated in practice for the first time since having lung surgery. Tomlin told Black and Gold Nation that Watt looked ‘great’ in practice despite the long layoff.\n\n“I doubt that T.J. is ever out of football shape or conditioning over the course of a 12-month calendar,” Tomlin said. “I just know how he lived his life and how he prepares, and how thoughtful he is in terms of what he puts in his body and how he trains.”\n\nWhile he’s still in ‘football shape,’ Watt was just a limited participant during practices last week. Per Tomlin, the decision on playing the former first-round pick could come down to the quality and the number of practices he has this week.\n\nThat leads to the question posed by ESPN’s Brooke Pryor. Would he have to be a full participant during multiple practices this week to play on Sunday?\n\n“Practice participation certainly would be more comforting in terms of making a decision, given he’s coming back from a medical circumstance,” Tomlin responded.\n\nSince it is a more unique circumstance, Tomlin does have to err on the side of caution when it comes to giving Watt the green light to play.\n\n“We want to be cautious about how we work him back into the fold,” Tomlin added.\n\nThree Steelers selected to Pro Bowl Games\n\nIt would be big for Pittsburgh to have Watt back in the fold. All-time, the Steelers have a 3-11 record in the regular season without the former Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nOne of the biggest games of his career could come on Sunday with an AFC North title on the line.",

    "fullText": "The No. 4 UConn men’s basketball team returns to action after a 10-day layoff following its 72-54 win over DePaul on Dec. 21. The Huskies are back on the road yet again as they travel to Cincinnati to face Xavier (9-4, 1-1) on Wednesday afternoon at the Cintas Center.\n\nThe Musketeers rank No. 100 in KenPom, with the No. 119 offense in the country, and 116th in the NET. These numbers aren’t great for a program that made two of the last three NCAA Tournaments, including just last season, but new head coach Richard Pitino has done a solid job building a team essentially from scratch that was competitive in non-conference play, perhaps more than a lot of people expected. The Musketeers beat both West Virginia and Cincinnati and lost by just one to Georgia.\n\nAs for UConn, the Huskies sit at No. 7 in KenPom and No. 8 in the NET. They have the fourth-rated defense in the country per KenPom, a continued step in the right direction from last season. The 12-1 Huskies’ only loss was to now- No.1 Arizona by four points in a game where Tarris Reed Jr. and Braylon Mullins were both out with injuries. In their last game, Alex Karaban led the charge with 21 points and three triples against the Blue Demons.\n\nThe Huskies look to start 3-0 in Big East play for the third time in their six seasons since rejoining the Big East, as the team did so in 2022-23 (3-0) and last season (4-0).\n\nDate/Time: Wednesday, Dec. 31, 5:00 p.m. EST\n\nTV/Stream: Peacock, NBC Sports Network (for YouTubeTV subscribers)\n\nRadio: UConn Sports Network, Sirius XM 85, Sirius/XM online streaming\n\nLocation: Cintas Center, Cincinnati OH\n\nKenPom Predicted Score: UConn 79-67\n\nThe Huskies and Musketeers have played 12 times, with the past 10 coming in Big East play. UConn has a narrow 7-5 advantage over Xavier with a 6-4 split in conference action. They last faced off on January 25, 2025, when Xavier beat UConn, 76-72 at the Cintas Center. Solo Ball led four Huskies in double figures with 20 points.\n\nAs of this writing, all players are expected to be available for Wednesday’s game. This includes Solo Ball, who sat out the Huskies’ previous game on 12/21 with a wrist injury. Dan Hurley said he’s been able to practice and will be good to go.\n\nRemember the last time a Top 5 UConn squad traveled on the road on New Year’s Eve to Xavier? It ended in a Musketeer win. The 14-0 Huskies led by Adama Sanogo and Co. suffered their first loss of the year in a game where the Musketeers used a big second half to pull away and hand the Huskies their first loss, more or less starting that infamous January of 2023 where the eventual national champs really struggled.\n\nThat’s not a one-off either. In fact, UConn has lost 3 of 5 games on the road at Xavier since joining the Big East. In addition to that game in 2022 and last year’s matchup while Liam McNeeley was out, the Huskies lost during the 2021-22 season by six points despite a combined 40 points from RJ Cole and Tyrese Martin.\n\nThat Xavier team in 2022 had names like Colby Jones, Jack Nunge, Zach Freemantle, and Souley Boum. The 2025 Musketeers don’t have that, not even particularly close, but somewhere deep in the mind of Dan Hurley, he’s having flashbacks from the past.\n\nWith the new head coach in Pitino, no scholarship players from last year’s Xavier team who played a single minute are back with the program. The lone returner is Roddie Anderson III, but he sat all of last season in a redshirt year. Pitino brought in players from all different levels of college basketball to construct the roster.\n\nLeading scorer Tre Carroll comes over from Florida Atlantic, where he was a key component to that Owls team that made the Final Four in 2022-23. Jovan Milicevic and Filip Borovicanin were both rotational frontcourt pieces for Pitino at New Mexico last year. Anthony Robinson and Pape N’Diaye were both reserve bigs for Virginia and UNLV, respectively, a year ago and retain that role for the Musketeers.\n\nIn the backcourt, All Wright (one of the best names in the sport) comes over from Valparaiso fresh off a great freshman year. Malik Messina-Moore and Isaiah Walker are both seniors from the mid-major level that have a lot of experience and games under their belts. Overall, this group has a good mix of veteran leadership and promising young talent.\n\nXavier has played two completely different games to kick off Big East play this season. In their opener, they hosted a struggling Creighton team that was searching for a big win. The result? A 41 point Bluejay win that saw them knock down 16 threes and shoot 60% from the field. Carroll only scored 7 points, by far his season low. The Musketeers looked lost on both ends of the floor and were down 27 by halftime. It was looking like that eighth place pick in the preseason poll may have ended up being too high.\n\nThen just a few days later the Musketeers traveled to Washington D.C. to take on Georgetown. After losing by over 40 points at home, it only made sense that they picked up a gritty road win on the road later on in the week. Carroll scored 22 points and Borovicanin had a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds in the 80-77 victory over the Hoyas.\n\nWith how well the Huskies have been playing early on in conference play with a pair of 18+ point victories, it’s easy to overlook some players who may be struggling or not playing up to their full potential that they’ve shown in non-con play.\n\nMalachi Smith is averaging 1 PPG and 1 APG through the first two Big East games after closing non-con with back-to-back 9-assist efforts vs. Florida and Texas. The Dayton transfer hasn’t been able to get a good rhythm going yet in league play, but he is averaging fewer minutes (15.5 in BE play, 19.8 in non-con).\n\nEric Reibe was everything UConn could have asked for and \n\nBoth UConn and Xavier do a good job of getting everybody involved in the offense, and it shows. The Musketeers are first in the league in assists per game at 18.6, but the Huskies aren’t far behind at 18.2. Those are on 27.1 and 29.2 made field goals per game, respectively, too, so both sides rack up assists at a rate north of 60%. Borovician and Messina-Moore combine for 8 APG, and Carroll and Anderson each average 2.8. For the Huskies, Silas Demary Jr.’s 5.8 and Smith’s 4.0 carry the load, but Karaban and Reed Jr. each average at least 2 as well.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea and Bournemouth served up a breathless 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge, a match shaped by ambition, uncertainty and one player who refused to shrink from the moment. Antoine Semenyo, amid strong expectation of a £65m move to Manchester City, played a decisive role for Bournemouth, creating two goals and conceding a penalty in a game that never settled.\n\nBournemouth struck first in the sixth minute when Semenyo’s long throw caused havoc and David Brooks finished from close range. Chelsea responded swiftly. Semenyo brought down Estevao Willian in the box and, after a VAR review, referee Sam Barrott pointed to the spot. Cole Palmer converted confidently before Enzo Fernandez curled a superb finish into the top corner to make it 2-1 inside 23 minutes.\n\nThe lead lasted barely four minutes. Once again Semenyo’s long throw proved decisive, Justin Kluivert reacting quickest to tap home. Bournemouth carried real threat thereafter and enjoyed the better of the first half, registering 14 attempts and testing Robert Sanchez repeatedly. For all Chelsea’s possession, Bournemouth’s directness unsettled them.\n\nAt the break, Enzo Maresca introduced Reece James and Pedro Neto, seeking control and urgency. Chelsea pushed higher, yet Bournemouth remained dangerous on the break. VAR dismissed appeals for handball against Malo Gusto, while Djordje Petrovic denied Estevao with a fine save from distance.\n\nChelsea had chances to win it. Fernandez blazed over from inside the box late on, the clearest opening of the second half. Joao Pedro replaced Palmer to audible frustration from the stands, reflecting a growing unease around Stamford Bridge. In stoppage time, Bournemouth nearly stole it when Enes Unal volleyed over from 12 yards after Amine Adli’s cross.\n\nThe draw leaves Chelsea with just one win in seven league matches and a worrying habit of surrendering leads, having now dropped 15 points from winning positions. December has been bruising, and confidence feels fragile ahead of a demanding trip to Manchester City without the suspended Moises Caicedo.\n\nFor Bournemouth, the performance carried encouragement despite extending their winless run to 10. Semenyo embodied their spirit, combining physicality, creativity and defensive discipline. Asked if this was his final appearance, Andoni Iraola said: “It is not his last game. I can’t say 100 percent but I think he will play, yes.\n\n“He needs to recover because we play Arsenal at home in another three days, against top of the league, he will be an important player for us, yes.”\n\nChelsea and Bournemouth remain searching for momentum, but on this chaotic afternoon, it was Semenyo who left the strongest impression.",

    "description": "Could Clemson bring in a familiar face to step back into the offensive coordinator position?",
    "fullText": "Clemson’s search for its next offensive coordinator is already drifting toward familiar territory.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, head coach Dabo Swinney parted ways with Garrett Riley on Monday, a move that immediately put the spotlight on how Clemson plans to reset an offense that struggled to find consistency throughout the 2025 season. Rather than casting a wide, public net, the early chatter has centered on comfort, trust, and prior success.\n\nThat’s where Chad Morris enters the picture.\n\nMorris is well known in Clemson circles, not only for his previous stint running the Tigers’ offense but for the long-standing relationship he shares with Swinney. Their history dates back more than a decade, and that familiarity could matter as the Tigers approaches a pivotal stretch with the transfer portal opening Jan. 2. Whoever steps into the role will be expected to stabilize the roster quickly while helping reestablish an offensive identity that has gone missing.\n\nAlthough Morris hasn’t called plays on a full-time basis in recent seasons, he has remained close to the game. He spent 2024 coaching at Texas State, served in analytical roles earlier in the decade, and took the 2025 season away from coaching to watch his son lead Virginia to an ACC Championship Game appearance. Even during that time, Morris stayed connected, spending time around Clemson late in the season to assist with preparation.\n\nMorris’ original run with the Tigers remains one of the most productive offensive periods in program history. From 2011 through 2014, Clemson routinely ranked among the nation’s top scoring teams, set numerous school records, and established the foundation for its rise on the national stage.\n\nFormer Clemson wide receiver Troy Stellato back in the transfer portal https://t.co/yeBexsZ5v8 pic.twitter.com/Fkwy0xzJkI\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) December 30, 2025\n\nA return now would look very different than it did a decade ago. Morris has already experienced the head coaching path, and this opportunity would be about fit and familiarity rather than ambition. For a program searching for offensive stability, that distinction matters.\n\nContact us @Clemson_Wire on X (formerly known as Twitter), and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Clemson Tigers news and notes, plus opinions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Clemson Wire: Former Clemson coach is a top candidate for the vacant OC job",

    "description": "After a sluggish first half, the Wildcats flipped a switch for a decisive victory to end non-conference play.",
    "fullText": "A surprisingly close first half was in tow, but Northwestern (8-5, 0-2 B1G) was able to pull away for a gritty 80-60 win over Howard (9-6, 0-0 MEAC) in front of a packed house at Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston.\n\nMuch like the return of Grace Sullivan for women’s basketball against Washington, top scorer Nick Martinelli was back in the starting lineup after missing NU’s loss to Butler with a concussion. However, Arrinten Page was dropped from the starting lineup, sitting on the bench the entire game for “violating team standards,” according to the Big Ten Network broadcast.\n\nDespite entering this game with the most efficient offense (49.1% FG) of the Chris Collins era through a season’s first 12 games, Northwestern has consistently been undermined by its defense. Teams under Collins have historically been defined by strong defensive identities, but that has not been the case this season.\n\nWith defensive ratings of 103.2 (KenPom) and 102.0 (Sports Reference), the Wildcats were posting their worst numbers since the 2014-15 season, where they posted defensive ratings of 103.2 (KenPom) and 104.7 (Sports Reference). The question then was whether that trend would continue.\n\nNorthwestern clung to a narrow lead for much of the game, and it felt like the ’Cats were never going to fully shake a persistent Howard squad, seeing their advantage cut to just two points early in the second half. Though Howard battled throughout, the Wildcats used a decisive late run to finally pull away, holding the Bison to just 32 second-half points.\n\nMartinelli led the ‘Cats offensively with a dominant 32 points and six rebounds, shooting 10-of-20 from the field. Tre Singleton provided a crucial all-around performance with 17 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two blocks, two steals and zero turnovers, playing with poise beyond his years.\n\nFor the Bison, it was Ose Okojie who kept Howard within striking distance for much of the contest. Okojie finished with a team-high 13 points, while Cam Gillus facilitated the offense with seven assists.\n\nThe difference in the game came from ball security and defensive pressure. Northwestern committed a mere five turnovers while forcing 14 from Howard, converting those into a decisive 21-6 advantage in points off turnovers. Though three-point shooting was nearly even, the Wildcats’ aggressive drive-and-kick game earned them 34 free throw attempts to Howard’s 13, providing the necessary margin to secure the win.\n\nBoth offenses sputtered from the opening tip. The Wildcats missed their first four field goal attempts before Martinelli drew a foul and sank two free throws for the game’s first points. Howard responded with a back-cut layup, and the tone was set for a half defined by defense and missed shots.\n\nThe Wildcats’ defense was active early, forcing eight turnovers and converting them into 13 points. A steal led to a transition foul on Angelo Ciaravino, who split a pair of free throws, and Singleton followed with a strong post move to put the Wildcats up 6-2.\n\nHoward briefly found its range, as Alex Cotton and Cedric Taylor III hit three-pointers to take an 8-7 lead. But the Wildcats responded with their own perimeter spark from an unexpected \n\nThe game remained tight until Mullins took over. Following a Howard turnover, he drained his third three-pointer in transition, forcing a Bison timeout with Northwestern leading 24-15 and 7:35 remaining.\n\nThird trey for @jmsaucing, 15-2 run for the 'Cats 😼\n\n📺 @BigTenNetwork pic.twitter.com/7JtSTsx9Ym\n\n— Northwestern Basketball (@NUMensBball) December 30, 2025\n\nHoward clawed back with a 5-0 run, capped by a Travelle Bryson dunk that prompted a timeout from Wildcats coach Chris Collins. Northwestern’s offense added seven more points before halftime, with a Jake West layup and a pair of Martinelli free throws coming off more Howard turnovers.\n\nMullins also rifled in his fourth three-pointer of the half to stay scorching hot and keep the ‘Cats in front. A Bryson three and a tip-in second-chance lay trimmed the Wildcats’ lead to 31-28 at the break.\n\nMullins was perfect in the half, scoring 12 points on 4-for-4 shooting from beyond the arc. Martinelli added 11 points for Northwestern, which shot 47.6% from the field and 62.5% from three-point range but attempted just 21 total shots.\n\nHoward stayed close by dominating the glass, outrebounding the Wildcats 20-10 with seven offensive boards. Okojie led the Bison with seven points, while Bryson added nine off the bench. The Bison shot 39.3% from the field and 41.7% from deep.\n\nThe Wildcats needed a more assertive second half after letting Howard hang around, and they delivered. The energy shifted decisively in their favor, turning a nail-biter into a comfortable 80-60 victory.\n\nThe half began with the ‘Cats sharpening their attack against Howard’s zone. Martinelli found space for a push jumper, and a strong defensive stand forced an early Bison timeout. The tone was set, though the Bison kept it close early, answering every Wildcat push.\n\nThe inflection point arrived midway through the half, and with the score tight, the Wildcats’ depth and hustle began to overwhelm Howard. Singleton was the Mullins of the second half, as his relentless effort on the glass and efficient offense sparked the key run. A sequence featuring a Max Green steal, a Tyler Kropp finish and Singleton’s own three-point play stretched the lead to 50-42.\n\nDefense ➡️ Offense\n\n📺 @BigTenNetwork pic.twitter.com/OC4etPNPwN\n\n— Northwestern Basketball (@NUMensBball) December 30, 2025\n\nFrom there, Northwestern methodically pulled away. It continued to dissect the Howard zone, with Martinelli, Singleton and Jordan Clayton finding easy buckets.\n\nDefensively, the Wildcats tightened the screws, generating turnovers and converting them into points. Jake West provided a steady hand, and even with Page sitting the entire game, the rotation had more than enough.\n\nThe final minutes were a formality. The ‘Cats attacked the press with ease, Martinelli pirouetted for a layup and the lead ballooned to 20. The Bison’s spirit was broken, and Northwestern closed out a dominant 49-32 second half to secure the win, proving it can flip the switch when needed.\n\nWith non-conference play closed out on a high note, Northwestern will look to earn its first conference win and start 2026 right in a Saturday clash versus Minnesota at Welsh-Ryan Arena on Jan. 3 at 4 p.m. CST.",

    "description": "Women's IC Champion Maxxine Dupri recently reflected on having a difficult time with hate she received online earlier in her career and how far she's progress.",
    "fullText": "WWE Women's Intercontinental Champion Maxxine Dupri shocked the WWE Universe when she defeated Becky Lynch on the November 17 edition of \"WWE Raw\" to take the gold from \"The Man,\" thanks to a little help from AJ Lee. Even before the victory, Dupri had already come a long way in WWE, from the manager of the Maxximum Male Models, to an actual in-ring competitor who is working hard to hone her craft. Dupri recently sat down with \"The Wrestling Classic\" and spoke about her evolution from fans booing her work during a live event to the point the locker room had to rally around her, to becoming champion.\n\n\"Thank you to my haters,\" she said. \"Truthfully, that live event, specifically, that didn't affect me personally. In the moment... When you're new to this and you're wrestling, I can't hear anything. I'm trying to make sure that I just survive this match and do the best I can do.\"\n\nDupri explained she did, however, have a hard time with hate she was getting on social media. She described it as a lesson she needed to learn and said people are entitled to their opinions, and she's entitled to protecting her peace.\n\n\"I have my people that give me my criticism and I know the things that I truly do need to work on that I'm falling short in, and I will always hold myself accountable for that and put my nose down and keep grinding,\" Dupri said. \"It was very challenging for a period of time, but there's pros and cons to everything and that's just part of this job.\"\n\nFans have been witness to a variety of video vignettes on \"Raw\" following her Women's Intercontinental Championship victory, showing Dupri working out in the Dudgeon alongside Natalya's \"Low Key Legend\" character, Nattie. Dupri said that Natalya, and her husband, former WWE star-turned-producer TJ Wilson, have single handedly changed the direction of her career thanks to their training.\n\n\"I think so much of this last year and everyone saying, 'Oh, Maxxine's improved a lot and we're seeing this new side.' It's truly what we do in the Dudgeon,\" she explained. \"Nattie says [it's] finding my 'FU.' It's the way that they push me to my limits in there... Pressure makes diamonds. They have to break you to make you and that is what happens in the Dudgeon.\"\n\nDupri said that the things she's learning in the Dudgeon are applicable to what she needs to be doing to remain on top of things in her matches to be able to stay on the offensive, as well as to reverse certain moves. She credited her training for her victory in her recent match against Ivy Nile. Dupri is set to square off with Lynch for the Women's IC title once again on the first \"Raw\" of 2026.\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit \"The Wrestling Classic\" and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer is appreciative of how good 2025 was to the club and is optimistic about the future in Bavaria.\n\n“It’s been an eventful, exciting and special year, at the end of which we have well over 430,000 members, which says a lot about how much is being done right in this club, both on and off the pitch. On behalf of the club, I would like to thank all members and fans for their support and loyalty,” Hainer told FCBayern.com. “Together, we can look back on an anniversary year with plenty of reasons to celebrate, which also gives us plenty of reasons to be optimistic: FC Bayern is in an excellent position, not least when you look at the league tables for our professional teams in both men’s and women’s football – and above all beyond that.\n\n“In sporting terms, we celebrated the ‘Bavarian treble’ with the men’s and women’s football championships and the basketball championship – something that has never happened before, and the women also won the double for the first time in their history. Financially, our CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen was able to post outstanding results at the Annual General Meeting, and in social matters, we once again implemented many projects in which we’re committed to helping people in need, promoting open-mindedness and diversity. In recent weeks in particular, we’ve been able to implement important decisions such as the extension of Vincent Kompany’s contract until 2029 and the acquisition of the Sportpark Unterhaching for the women’s team. We celebrated 125 years of FC Bayern and are in an excellent position to continue our success story.”\n\nA big part of how others view 2026 will be tied to the success of the men’s team, which is in great position at the moment. Will Hainer have the same type of outlook at this time next year?\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "fullText": "Despite missing many of their heavy hitters, Manchester United fans must have been confident of claiming all three points on Tuesday.\n\nAfter all, the Red Devils were playing at home against bottom-of-the-barrel Wolverhampton Wanderers, on the back of keeping a clean sheet against Newcastle last week.\n\nHowever, the home side had to be content with a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, in a game characterised by bizarre calls.\n\nRuben Amorim once again chose to tweak things at the back, while his substitution calls were all wrong as he once again adopted a safety-first approach instead of throwing the kitchen sink.\n\nAnd skipper on the night, Lisandro Martinez was far from pleased with this attitude. In his post-match interview with Sky Sports, the Argentine did not hold back.\n\nHe claimed that the 20-time English league champions should be defeating this type of opposition at the Theatre of Dreams, and the lack of risk was an affront to what the club stands for.\n\n“Really disappointed. We can’t come here at home and draw this game. We have to win when we play at home. The opponent has to suffer and we didn’t get the three points.\n\n“Very frustrating. The team gave everything. Just for a few moments, we conceded in the last moment of the first half, that can happen. We can deserve that, it’s our responsibility.\n\n“We played well with the ball in the first half but then we dropped too much, couldn’t press their centre backs. They were comfortable with the ball and they started moving round and creating spaces.\n\n“Wolves don’t deserve the place they are, it’s a strong team. We respect them. We have to take more risks.\n\n“The lads are very disappointed, we expect better. We have to take it and accept it and go for the next one.”\n\nNot utilising all five subs, while changing things at the back instead of being bold has become a hallmark under Amorim.\n\nA draw means the 20-time English league champions remain sixth in the table, squandering the opportunity to go fourth. Up next is a visit to Elland Road to play arch-rivals Leeds United.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "John Wood helped lift Merab Dvalishvili to greatness, making him MMA Junkie's 2025 Coach of the Year.",
    "fullText": "Individual sports often fail to highlight the team effort behind every athlete, and MMA is no different.\n\nFighters take the bulk of the glory when they get their hand raised in the cage, and rightfully so. But there's also a massive effort behind the scenes, including sparring partners, nutritionists, psychologists, and perhaps most importantly, coaches. This year, John Wood, owner and head coach of Syndicate MMA in Las Vegas, was behind the greatness MMA Junkie's 2025 Fighter of the Year, Merab Dvalishvili, plus many other standout performances.\n\nWood, a veteran coach, helped turn Dvalishvili from a champion unlikely to make a title defense, at least according to the odds and general perception, to one of the most dominant champions in the history of the UFC bantamweight division.\n\nDvalishvili entered UFC 311 in January as an underdog against challenger Umar Nurmagomedov. Yet, against the odds, Dvalishvili outworked Nurmagomedov over the course of 25 minutes, announcing to the world that he was here to stay, and earning a Fight of the Night award in the process.\n\nThe work didn't stop there for Wood. Dvalishvili wanted nothing to do with the typical championship calendar in the UFC, which often involves two title defenses. Wood had to go back to the drawing board and prep for three more championship fights, as Dvalishvili went for MMA history – trying to become the first ever to defend a UFC title four times in a calendar year.\n\nWood got Dvalishvili ready for UFC 316 in June. He not only dominated Sean O'Malley in the rematch, but this time he finished him, becoming the first to submit \"Suga.\" It was a huge sign Dvalishvili had leveled up under Wood's wing. Dvalishvili would return four months later to face Cory Sandhagen at UFC 320 in October. Once again, he dominated, completely shutting down Sandhagen to tie the record for the most consecutive UFC bantamweight title defenses.\n\nFast-forward two months, and Wood was back again cornering a UFC championship fight – this time with Dvalishvili taking on former champion Petr Yan. Unfortunately for Dvalishvili and his camp, they fell short in their bid for history. Yan had the game plan to dethrone Dvalishvili. Yet, despite the defeat, Dvalishvili made a good account of himself, likely co-creating the best championship fight seen in the history of the UFC's bantamweight division.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect run for Dvalishvili in 2025, but it was a damn good one, and Wood was there every step of the way.\n\nWood also had his hand in many other big wins in 2025. He cornered Khalil Rountree's decision win over former champion Jamahal Hill at UFC Baku; Nazim Sadykhov's brutal KO wins over Ismael Bonfim and Nikolas Motta; Luana Santos' 2-0 run; and others.\n\nWood's fantastic work with \"The Machine\" along with other fighters is the reason why he's MMA Junkie's 2025 Coach of the Year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: John Wood names 2025 Coach of the Year",

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim says “there is no doubt in” his “mind” that Manchester United will finish the season well.\n\nThe United head coach was speaking at the post-match press conference following his side’s dismal 1-1 draw with Wolves at Old Trafford this evening.\n\nThe first question of the conference was whether Amorim feels the seven senior absences contributed to tonight’s poor result.\n\n“That is normal, but we didn’t use that excuse against Newcastle,” Amorim replied.\n\n“We are not going to use today. But of course, if you see the game, I understand why we play the way we play today, the lack of fluidity, lack of one against one. We knew that that would be a completely different game compared to Newcastle, because in Newcastle, we have more space to play. We didn’t have to work the play so much. And today, we have difficulties in that aspect and that is clear.”\n\nThe boss was then asked to explain why he had made a tactical tweak of reverting to three at the back, switching Patrick Dorgu back to the left.\n\n“No, we knew that they will play with five. They will use it the width. And today was just to do that and then sometimes building up with him open or close with Luke Shaw doing the opposite,” he explained. “So we try to arrange the right situations for the situation that we have in the moment.”\n\nThe next question came from the BBC’s Simon Stone.\n\n“Ruben, you’ve said a lot that you know that this team is not a finished article, but is this, tonight, an example that you need more creativity in your side? There was a lack of creativity, and it feels as though there’s some players within your squad who can’t give you what you need, and you need greater depth?”\n\n“No, I think we are in one situation that you have a lot of players out in the same time. Of course, when you play Casemiro and Ugarte in the middle, you know that is different. When you have Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount or Bruno, that is normal. We just need to recover our players, the players from Afcon to return, and then the fluidity is going to be different.”\n\n“But again, we won the last one and today we could win with the players that we have. We had lack of fluidity and then lack of quality and then lack of creation of chances. Then we suffered a goal with set pieces with the team, and we are tall in this moment. So these details are important to win these games in difficult moments.”\n\nThe next reporter asked Amorim if it was difficult to try to bring academy players in to the team in such difficult circumstances.\n\n“Yeah, it’s completely different,” he agreed. “You know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle. It’s completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid. You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects. I think that was what happened during the game.”\n\nThe follow-up question was about the level of risk Amorim took in substituting the goalscorer Joshua Zirkzee at half-time.\n\n“We need to do what the game was asking,” he explained. “We were struggling. They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and we managed to do with Jack, we balanced that. I think we recover the ball faster in the second half. In the first half, we struggled a little bit to recover the ball. I’m just looking not for their age and the experience. In this moment, I just look what I can do to win the game.”\n\nWas the Zirkzee substitution due to an injury or was it purely tactical? “No, it was just tactical,” Amorim replied.\n\n“The home form was encouraging at the start of the season, but that’s now one win in five at home, and most of the opponents have been from the lower end of the table. Is it an extra pressure being at home? Why do you think this is happening? It wasn’t just tonight, where it’s been a struggle.”\n\n“I don’t feel… I think against Everton, we clearly underperformed,” he said. “West Ham, we had some lack of creation, but we have our chances. Bournemouth, we had advantage three times. So it’s the details. It was not offensively, was not the creation of chances. We had the game. We had full control of the game. Today was completely different. Newcastle, we struggled, but we managed to win at home.”\n\n“I think this year, I don’t feel that. I feel the support of the fans when we are here. I feel that they want to play at home. I feel that we are dominant at home. We won one that they were a little bit more dominant, was the last one. Today, we had lack of quality, fluidity in the game today, and that was the reason of our game today.”\n\nSimon Peach asked “Andy’s touched on the other point, home results. You’re only two points off of a potential Champions League spot at the halfway point of the season. How do you look at things going into the new year and how confident are you?”\n\n“I’m really confident. We just need to recover all the players and I’m really confident,” the boss smiled.\n\n“I don’t know what is going to happen until the end of the season. Then we will make the resumé of the season. But I’m really confident when we recover all the players that we are going to be a strong team. There is no doubt in my mind.”\n\nFinally, asked whether anyone will be back for the next match against Leeds, he answered:\n\n“I don’t know. I have to check. I’m not going to risk anyone to lose them for one month or two months. We will try to arrange the solutions. Again, let’s see, and we will try to win the next one with no risks for the players.”\n\nFeatured image Alex Livesey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

It took a pretty extravagant effort to go in the first place on Monday, but I’m extremely pleased that I did.\n\nWhile the rest of the schools in the conference are in urban or suburban settings, the Mount is plopped down a few miles from town on either side of Highway 15. There’s nothing around. On one side, the athletic complex. On the other side, all of the academic buildings. If you stand in just the right spot on the side of the athletic complex, you see the golden twinkle of the Statue of Blessed Mother, nestled amongst the hilly backdrop, rising high above the blue triangular facade of Knott Arena in the foreground. It’s a view unlike any other in the conference.\n\nThe arena itself transports you to a different era. Its unique architecture and wooden bleachers give it an energy that exudes historical importance, even though it’s merely a 38-year old building. Then you look up and see the massive new videoboard in one end zone, and the balcony-style hospitality seating in the other end zone.\n\nMount St. Mary’s athletic director Brad Davis has pushed renovations and changes to many parts of the building since he took over, but he also takes pride in the charm that it offers. He said that people tell him that Knott Arena is “the Hinkle of the MAAC.” I can’t say whether they’re right or not, but there’s an aura of mysticism that other venues in the conference just don’t have.\n\nI’ve made the trip. I successfully battled the cutting gusts attempting to sweep my Nissan Kicks off of its wheels to make it and watch a basketball game between the Mount and Iona. The Mountaineers grabbed a 66-59 victory – their first MAAC win of the year – riding two 10-point scoring runs in the second half. Here are three takeaways from each team\n\nAfter missing the first 10 games of the season, Wofford transfer Anthony Arrington made his Mount debut against Loyola on Dec. 13. He slid right into the guard rotation on the bench, having played 21 minutes per contest over the last four.\n\nIn the second half on Monday, Arrington scored seven points in a row for the Mount as part of the first of the two 10-0 scoring runs. He gave the Mount a 42-41 lead with a corner three, and the building erupted.\n\nHe also played a role in bottling up Iona star CJ Anthony. He supplements Xavier Lipscomb’s physicality with another strong body off the bench, part of why the Mount was able to play the game that it wanted to play for a full 40.\n\n“We were able to put guys on him that could match his physicality,” Donny Lind said. “We made it uncomfortable for him as much as we could. He’s a really good player, and I was pleased with the effort we had.”\n\nArrington hasn’t been efficient offensively so far, but that second half stretch shows that he can provide a lift when needed.\n\nLuke McEldon is 6-foot-10, 255 pounds but has skill beyond being a straight bruiser. That’s becoming a rare archetype in the MAAC and at the mid-major level, and he balled out on Monday with 18 points on 9-of-12 shooting from the field.\n\nThe Mount got him involved early and often. He got post-ups against Lamin Sabally – whom he has two inches and 40 pounds on. He got dropoffs from the guards for layups, and he played with comfort and energy throughout the night.\n\n“We usually try to get the ball inside as often as possible early in the game,” McEldon said. “And from there we can play on the outside.”\n\nBut on a night where the outside shots weren’t falling, it was McEldon and Justin Amadi pounding it down low all night. Even when McEldon picked up two fouls in the first half, Lind stuck with him for a few minutes, trusting him to not pick up a third while being the matchup problem that he is.\n\nIt’s going to be hard to top AK Kébé’s alley-oop dunk during the second 10-0 run when it comes to picking out the best slam of the year in the MAAC. Arlandus Keyes let go of the ball when Kebe was still a foot or two behind the 3-point line, but suddenly, Kebe appeared at the rim, sneaking past Alliou Fall to grab the ball where only he could get it and flush it home.\n\nThe Mount has scored six in a row and that was an ABSURD alley-oop from Arlandus Keyes to AK Kebe in transition. Kebe just glided through the air for that one and appeared at the rim for a monster slam.\n\nMonster crowd reaction. Timeout Iona. 52-46\n\n— Sam Federman (@Sam_Federman) December 30, 2025\n\nIt immediately forced an Iona timeout. The Knott Arena crowd was stunned. For a Mount St. Mary’s team that feeds off of energy and emotion – as we saw in the MAAC Tournament – it was a play that got the entire bench jumping.\n\n“It was insane, it better be on SportsCenter,” Arrington said.\n\n“We’re working with him and focusing on those things that he can do that nobody else can,” Lind said. “With his length and his athleticism, and the ability to get deflections, and the ability to make plays on defense that turn into offense, or a tip-in.”\n\nIt was just Kebe’s fifth game of the season, as he missed the first eight and the Loyola game, but the tantalizing moments are happening more often this year.\n\nIona leads the MAAC with 13 killshots (10-0 runs), and it even had one in the first half of this game. It nearly had another in the early part of the second half, scoring eight in a row to build a nine-point lead. However, the Gaels couldn’t stack possessions together in between runs once the threes stopped falling early on.\n\nThen, in the second half, the Mount put together two killshots. One to take a 42-41 lead, and then one to take a 58-46 lead, essentially salting the game away by holding the Gaels scoreless for more than four minutes.\n\nLike the Quinnipiac game, a physical MAAC opponent just wore them down in the second half. Dan Geriot looks at when the Gaels had a 41-32 lead as a missed opportunity.\n\n“It’s more like how do you keep hitting those singles, how do you keep pushing forward together?” Geriot said. “And a lot of the snowball that went the wrong way was based on our transition offense, and that’s something that we have seen a little bit before, so we need to understand that, feel that, see it on film and continue to converse with the guys about it.”\n\nCJ Anthony might be the single best story in the MAAC this season. I’ll tell you that story in a feature later this week. He took the league by storm in non-conference play but played his worst game of the season on Monday.\n\nHe’s essentially been able to control the game flow for Iona almost every night, and if he couldn’t, he’d hit a few big shots to make up for it. He didn’t have that against the Mount. He scored 10 points on 3-9 from the field, which isn’t a bad “worst game,” but it certainly felt as though he didn’t have the impact that he usually does.\n\nThe Mount put a few different bodies on him, threw pressure at him and mitigated his impact, but it’s all part of the process for Geriot.\n\n“I think it’s him learning it,” Geriot said. “I talk about it all the time, we gotta go through this. Dealing with ball pressure is good for him, I believe we failed correctly tonight. I don’t believe we were out of sorts – we were out of sorts with our passing, and that’s a big thing for us.”\n\nAs previously mentioned, McEldon had a great night for the Mount. Iona as a team is much better defending the perimeter than the paint, and the Mountaineers leveraged different ways to get in the paint and feed McEldon to exploit that.\n\nGeriot thinks the Gaels need to read the plays better when the ball gets in the paint.\n\n“We’re giving up too much at the rim by overhelping,” he said. “We got to continue to read our help, and that’s how we become an elite defensive team.”\n\nSiena’s staff definitely saw how the Mount created points at the basket, and would love to see Justice Shoats and Gavin Doty hit those dropoffs to Tassie Goodrick (should he play) and Antonio Chandler on Friday night.\n\nMarist’s three MAAC games this year have been 72, 75, and now 68 possessions. Of the 21 that it played last year, only four of them were 68 or more possessions. Asim Jones has scored in double figures in six of the last seven games for Quinnipiac, and the one time that he didn’t is QU’s only loss in that stretch. While Tarik Watson and Jason Schofield can rack up points when they get the ball in the post, I don’t always feel like the best use of Marist’s possessions is playing through the bigs.\n\nMerrimack was probably due for a better shooting night after going 26% and 27% against Princeton and Vermont, and Sacred Heart got caught in the crosshairs of that early. The Warriors started 5-0 last year, and are 3-0 to start this season despite five new starters. It was another 18 points and 7 assists for freshman point guard Kevair Kennedy, who is making a habit out of that at the moment. Sacred Heart is allowing opponents to shoot 61% inside the arc in MAAC play.\n\nDavis Bynum had a game-high 19. He had just 17 total points on the season after the Broncs lost to Quinnipiac on Dec. 7. He’s now set season highs in four successive games. Perhaps Rider playing through him and Shemani Fuller more will lead to more success. But Manhattan got big bench production from Anthony Isaac and Terrance Jones. The Jaspers are still a thin team, but have two punches off the bench this year instead of just one.\n\nZaakir Williamson had his first double-double in a Saint Peter’s uniform, but the Peacock guards crashing the glass (eight rebounds for Bland, seven for Eaton) might be the story of the game. Fairfield is a tremendous rebounding team, and Saint Peter’s got in there and beat them on the glass. We know that Braden Sparks, Brandon Benjamin and Declan Wucherpfennig can put numbers on the board, but the Stags need to find consistent offense beyond those three.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers halted a three-game losing streak with a win over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday and now look to make it two in a row when they host the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, December 30.\n\nFather Time may be undefeated, but LeBron James is still keeping him at bay. As he celebrates his 41st birthday, my Pistons vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks anticipate another strong showing from King James.\n\nPistons vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists (-115)\n\nLeBron James has played 10 games on his birthday throughout his career, averaging 32.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 6.9 assists, going for at least 35 PRA in every game played on December 30.\n\nSince his streak of double-digit scoring games was snapped on December 4, James has averaged 25.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists across eight games. He’s reached 36 PRA in five of 14 games this season, including four of his last eight.\n\nWith Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, and Rui Hachimura sidelined for the Los Angeles Lakers, James will need to take on a larger role as a scorer, rebounder, and facilitator. Tonight’s tilt with the Detroit Pistons should feature plenty of points, which means additional opportunities for James to stuff the stat sheet.\n\nJames surely understands the gravity of this moment, as he’s playing in a record-setting 23rd season and taking the court, and I expect him to make a statement tonight on his 41st birthday, showing that age is just a number.\n\nThe Lakers are 19-11 to the Over, and the Pistons are 16-15-1 O/U.\n\nLos Angeles has hit the Over in 11 of 13 home games, good for the highest percentage in the Association. The Lakers have gone Over in four of five as the home underdog. Detroit has hit the Over in two of its last three outings, including high-scoring matchups against the Utah Jazz and Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Pistons should be motivated to snap a two-game skid when they visit Crypto.com Arena tonight.\n\nDetroit most recently fell to the Los Angeles Clippers thanks to a career-high 55 points from Kawhi Leonard, and lost to the Utah Jazz on a go-ahead bucket from Keyonte George in the game before that.\n\nWith the Lakers missing several key players, the Pistons have the edge to snap the short losing streak before it gets out of hand.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham is averaging 26.5 points per game this season, and he's hit the Over on this scoring line in 15 of 29 games, including two straight. He's scored 26+ in 10 of 17 games on the road, and he's reached that mark in four of his last six outside of Little Caesars Arena.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham Over 25.5 points\n\nSpread: Pistons -2.5 (-110) | Lakers +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Pistons -140 | Lakers +120\n\nOver/Under: Over 232 (-110) | Under 232 (-110)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have hit the Game Total Over in 34 of their last 55 games (+10.90 Units / 18% ROI).

    "fullText": "Real Madrid continue to set the benchmark in European football, sitting atop the latest UEFA club coefficient rankings ahead of Bayern Munich and Inter Milan. The standings, calculated based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, once again underline Madrid’s sustained dominance on the continental stage.\n\nAccording to the figures published by UEFA, Real Madrid lead the rankings with 131,500 points, a significant margin over second-placed Bayern Munich (124,250) and Inter Milan (121,250). The top six is rounded out by Manchester City (117,750), Liverpool (115,500), and reigning Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain (109,500).\n\nThe UEFA club coefficient is determined by results in the Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League over a rolling five-year period. During that time, Real Madrid have lifted the Champions League trophy twice, a key factor in their commanding position at the top of the rankings.\n\nThe list also highlights the balance of power across Europe’s major leagues. Among the top ten clubs, there are:\n\nTwo Spanish teams: Real Madrid (1st) and Barcelona (9th)\n\nThree German teams: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Bayer Leverkusen\n\nThree English teams: Manchester City, Liverpool, and Arsenal\n\nOne French team: Paris Saint-Germain\n\nFor Real Madrid, the numbers are less a surprise than a confirmation. Across eras, managers, and squads, the club continues to turn European nights into a competitive advantage. While others rise and fall with cycles of success, Madrid’s consistency over the last five years reinforces their reputation as the defining force in European football.",

With the transfer portal opening on Jan. 2, and only lasting for two weeks, it will be imperative to make a strong and immediate impact.\n\nThe first step to shoring up the roster is evaluating the members of MSU's roster that will be retained, while identifying the needs to plug holes in the starting lineup.\n\nTaking a look at the position groups on the Spartans roster, it will distinguish who the team may be pursuing when the portal opens at the turn of the new year.\n\nAfter breaking down the offensive roster, the time has come to look at the specialists, and what new special teams coordinator LeVar Woods is going to have deal with for his first season in East Lansing.\n\nNow, the Spartans are going to have to deal with the loss of Ryan Eckley to the NFL Draft and Martin Connington to the transfer portal, shaking up the room big time.\n\nOutlook: Luckily, Michigan State has a very good, young long snapper in Wills, who can lock down the position that's importance is very under the radar.

That's how valou3433.pusku.com became my very first website.\n\nHosting a website was mostly about proving to myself that I could do it, and partly about showing off to friends\n(as well as sharing simple, fun projects I had built at the time). When I received\na Raspberry Pi as a gift (for my birthday or Christmas, I can't recall) and realized\n(thanks to previous experience with Minecraft server hosting) that I could host my\nwebsite on it, I immediately started configuring it that way.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Model B (or 1B), one of the first low-cost consumer Single Board Computers (SBC).\nEssentially, a board with an integrated CPU, RAM and I/O that can act as\na full computer; or in my case, a mini-server.\n\nWikipedia, CC-BY-SA 3.0\n\nThis became my de facto first homelab, allowing me to learn how to configure a web server,\nand leaving me wanting more. Before long, I was also running an FTP server, which I\nused for file sharing between computers as well as backups. It turned out to\nbe disastrous, as the SD cards I used with the Pi got corrupted multiple times;\nbut it was really fun!\n\nAfter high school, I entered a French prépa (classes préparatoires), a two-year\nintensive program preparing students for competitive entrance exams for engineering schools. It\nwas mostly math and physics, which didn't leave much time for personal projects.\n\nHowever, with COVID, my second year became quite unusual: France was in full lockdown\njust before exams, and some were canceled; so I decided to retake it. My third\nyear was lighter and finally allowed me to spend time on personal projects again.\n\nI also had my first apartment at that time, and quickly bought an old NAS server\nto share files between my computers, including laptops and machines at my mom's house.\n\nMy first NAS (Network Attached Storage) server. Basically, a box where you insert\ndisks, connect a network cable, and it makes the files available over the network.\n\nThe NAS was a D-Link DNS-323, released in 2006, featuring a 500MHz ARM CPU and 64 MiB of RAM.\nIt ran a proprietary operating system, and after hacking it\nto install a stripped-down Linux distribution, it became somewhat unusable.\nThe file sharing was outdated and slow, and I didn't have enough RAM to even hope installing applications. I clearly needed something more\npowerful.\n\nSoon after, I built my first real home server:\n\nUnboxing all the parts before assembly\n\nAt the time, I was using Arch Linux on my laptop and decided that it would be a good idea to use\nit on the server too.\nI set it up, and natively installed software: a web server, Jellyfin, Transmission torrent client, and Nextcloud.\n\nDeploying applications natively turned out to be a management nightmare. The deploying part was not that bad, but it needed\nextra steps like installing and configuring dependencies, and editing configuration files directly.\nOnce everything was set up, through Arch Linux packages or AUR packages, keeping the server up to date was the difficult part.\nI remember a specific issue I had where Jellyfin needed an older version of the .NET runtime, but another app needed a newer\none, and they were both conflicting. This was not the only issue, and overall, deploying applications natively does not\nseem like a good idea in modern times for a setup that isn't 'basic' like a simple web stack.\n\nThe server stayed in my apartment and worked well for a year. During summer, I moved\nback to my mom's house, then to Rennes for studies in a studio apartment, leaving the\nserver behind.\n\nFast-forward a year, I met my girlfriend in Rennes, and we decided to move in together.\nThis allowed for a larger apartment, with enough room for a new server. I ended up\nbuying a Lenovo P330 Tower SFF.\n\nHaving done more research this time, I wanted to try Proxmox. I installed it on that server,\nand started with LXC containers; first manually,\nthen with community-scripts.\n\nProxmox VE is an operating system based on Linux Debian, that provides a web interface allowing to manage QEMU-KVM hardware-accelerated virtual machines (VMs) and LinuX Containers (LXC). LXC is a technology using Linux kernel features (CGroups, kernel namespaces, chroots) to provide 'system containers', isolated but sharing the same kernel. Like a virtual machine, but with less isolation and less overhead.\n\nI started using software like Pi-Hole (ad-blocking DNS server), reverse proxies, and more\nadvanced services like the *arr stack, Photoprism, Gitea,\nHome Assistant, NodeRed, Syncthing\nand others.\n\nGiven the 'SFF' nature of that first server, hard drive support was quite limited. I wanted to level-up my local storage\ncapacity, so I decided to build a NAS server that would look more professional. I made a few mistakes on the way, but it was\na good experience overall. I documented the build process in a YouTube video, which, unfortunately for my English-speaking\nreaders, is in French.\n\nI use the TrueNAS operating system (Debian-based) for my NAS.\nI set up multiple ZFS pools, with a mirror of two 4 TB hard drives\nfor my personal data, a 12 TB hard drive for disposable data and a mirror of two 128 GB SSDs for fast application data. I also\nset up off-site backups to my old server, still at my mom's house, using ZFS replication.\n\nThis also meant that I now had two servers, and needed to set up fast networking between them. I bought and learned to use 10Gbit\nSFP+ cards, fiber optic cables and modules.\n\nTo connect the servers and my computers, I bought a QNAP QSW-M408-4C managed switch. It had 4 SFP+/RJ45 combo 1/2.5/5/10 Gbps ports,\nand 8 RJ45 1 Gbps ports. It is a wonderful switch, but was a bit noisy, so I replaced the stock fan with a Noctua.\nIt still serves me well, and given the many possible speeds, it is a useful switch.\n\nThe QNAP QSW-M408-4C (image credits: QNAP)\n\nI also wanted to advertise my DNS server over DHCP, and wanted to get rid of my ISP-provided router.\nI bought a Banana PI BPI-R4, which I use as router with OpenWRT to this day.\nIt is quite useful: advertises Pi-Hole as DNS server automatically, can manage different VLANs (virtual\nsub-networks) for regular use, servers, guests, and IoT devices; and can act as a Wireguard VPN peer.\n\nThe BananaPi BPI-R4. Don't worry, I have it in an enclosure :)\n\nThat last part is interesting for two reasons. First, I sometimes want to access home services while away.\nThe easiest solution would be to expose the service to the internet, which I sometimes do for public-facing projects\n(for example: this website). However, this means that if there is a security issue with\nthe app, anyone could take advantage of it. For most services (like my personal photo gallery Photoprism), I don't\nwant to have them publicly accessible. There are many known solutions for this (Cloudflare Tunnels for example), but my personal take is just to connect to my local\nnetwork with a VPN. This way, I can access the services but also the servers directly, as if I was always at home.\nIt has downsides (if you want to share this to other users, they need to know how to configure a VPN), but it works for me.\nSome solutions (like Tailscale) allow to have a nice UI and client to manage the VPN settings and\ncredentials, but I'm fine with editing Wireguard configurations by hand (or using OpenWRT Wireguard integration).\n\nAnother use of Wireguard is site-to-site VPN. My old server, still at my mom's house, is useful for off-site backups.\nIt is directly reachable from my network as the router will route packets through Wireguard automatically, without any\nconfiguration needed on the client. My local IP range is something like '10.1.0.0/16', and the second site, my mom's house,\nhas IP addresses under '10.2.0.0/16'. The OpenWRT routers on both sides have special rules to route those IPs through Wireguard.\n\nThere are a ton of interesting things around networking, but I'm still very much a beginner in the matter. As long as that\npart worked for connecting my two servers, I was able to move on and use them to deploy more services.\n\nFor a while, I was happy with that setup; but after a bit of time I stumbled upon an application that\nwas only distributed as an OCI image. I did not know much about Docker at the time, but I quickly had\nto learn about it.\n\nDocker is a software solution allowing for application containers.\nUnlike LXC/system containers, an application container typically only ships what is needed to run a specific application.\nFor example, it would not contain systemd, nor system tools, but only the libraries needed to run the app. This allows\nfor easy deployment (and distribution) of applications, as easy as docker run app:latest (if the developer ships an OCI\n\nThe Open Container Initiative (OCI) defines container runtime, image format, and distribution.\nDocker can run and pull OCI images, in an OCI-compliant way.\n\nAt first, it felt awkward. I had one LXC container running a Docker instance for each Dockerized app.\nIt felt off to SSH into those machines to copy docker-compose.yml files and start containers with\ndocker compose up.\n\nHowever, after a while, mostly after seeing this video, it started to click.\nI started managing my repo of compose files, had one large virtualized Docker instance, and could deploy\ndirectly from my laptop using Docker contexts.\n\nLike in the video, I also learned to use Docker Swarm and Gitea actions to deploy my own Nuxt.js application,\nBuildPath.\n\nI loved the idea of automatic deployment, checked out in git, automatically managed by a controller.\n\nLearning about this kind of deployment naturally led me to hear about GitOps practices, that are mostly adopted\nfor Kubernetes deployments. So I had to learn Kubernetes.\n\nKubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications (from kubernetes.io). Essentially, it is a container orchestrator, not only running containers like Docker but also\nscheduling them on multiple nodes, managing their lifetime, external connections with load balancing, and many more.\n\nI started by deploying a VM with k3s, since it was presented to me as \"the Kubernetes distribution that is the\neasiest to use\". I quickly deployed example services, using manifests, but nothing felt \"GitOps\", only\ndeclarative, and only for the services.\n\nThis is when I discovered Talos Linux and FluxCD (as well as ArgoCD).\n\nTalos Linux is a minimalist, immutable Linux distribution designed for Kubernetes. Everything, including the OS, is managed declaratively; and the only programs bundled or installable are the Kubernetes executables and libraries.\n\nFluxCD is a tool keeping a cluster in sync with a Git repository (or other sources). It deploys or deletes services automatically,\nafter each commit/push, applying the declared configuration checked out in Git.\n\nTalos allowed me to have everything, including the OS, managed in a declarative way. Flux allowed the services\nto be deployed and synced automatically from a git repository. It was everything I wanted, so I started to use it.\nThat was the start of my homeprod repository.\n\nKubernetes also has formidable features and tooling, allowing for a much better quality-of-life than docker. For example,\nwith Docker, when deploying a new service 'appxyz', and adding the Traefik (reverse-proxy) annotation 'host=appxyz.lan', I still\nhave to go to my local DNS server (Pi-Hole) and add a binding for 'appxyz.lan'. On Kubernetes, with ExternalDNS, creating the ingress will directly create the DNS mapping in Pi-Hole. Nice!\n\nThere are a lot more interesting features: from a consumer perspective, Helm charts are wonderful (even though they seem hard\nto write). The only part left to configure is the app configuration, unlike with docker-compose where you have to manually\nspecify which database container you want to run, which Redis, ... The only downside is that the Helm chart setup is more\nverbose.\n\nI still have a lot to learn about Kubernetes, and consider myself far from an experienced user.\n\nI still had one issue: I was deploying the Talos VM by hand on my Proxmox host. This felt inconsistent, knowing that\neverything else was managed in the repo by controllers. This is when I discovered Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) is managing infrastructure (virtual machines, for example) declaratively, as\ncode files, instead of in a procedural way (using commands or interfaces to deploy). For example, instead\nof interacting with a cloud dashboard to request and configure a new VM, you would modify a file adding a VM\ndefinition and configuration and then call a controller to reconcile the real infrastructure.\n\nTerraform is such a controller and language, that supports providers like AWS, Azure or even Proxmox.\n\nI quickly wrote my first Terraform files, that would deploy and kickstart my Talos VM, as well as a few others.\n\nExtract of the Terraform code file used to deploy the Talos Linux VM on Proxmox\n\nIn the meantime, I had done the terrible mistake of installing the eBay app on my phone. I\ndiscovered listings for used enterprise rack servers, and immediately bought one as a test, but quickly discovered\nthat the noise made it unusable in an apartment.\n\nFortunately, my girlfriend and I later moved from Rennes to Toulouse, and found a small house, with a small garden that had an independent room. That was all the justification I needed to start\nlooking for a rack. I found one on Leboncoin, a French website for used goods,\nfor cheap.\n\nInstalling the empty rack in the now server room. It came with a good UPS, which I still use today.\nAs you can see, I'm behind it trying to wire everything up.\n\nThe rack, populated with previous rack servers as well as the P330 and the NAS.\n\nAfter a while, I also bought the server I'm using today: a Dell PowerEdge R740.\n\nThis server has impressive specifications:\n\nI'm currently finishing the migration of every service from my old P330 to the R740. I'm also migrating the NAS,\nas I now have a rack-mounted disk enclosure with an HBA card.\n\nThe Dell PowerEdge R740 (2U server)\n\nThe 3D-printed disk enclosure I use with the R740 for my virtual NAS (still missing a few pieces on the picture).\n\nThe R740 is powerful enough to act as a build environment, using ephemeral VMs, which is very useful\nfor my work at Canonical. It also includes iDRAC (Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller), Dell's implementation of IPMI for remote management.\n\nIPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a specification for independent management of a system. For example, with IPMI,\nyou can shutdown but also power on a system, set virtual cd-rom drives from ISO images for operating system installation, send remote mouse or keyboard events and watch video output of the server. Usually, a KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) can have the same functionality when plugged in consumer hardware, like the PiKVM, NanoKVM or others.\n\nMy Kubernetes setup migrated seamlessly to the new server: I just updated some Terraform variables, redeployed Talos (applying the new Terraform configuration), and Flux pulled everything automatically. But my Docker setup still required manual redeploys from compose files, which felt out of place.\n\nFortunately, a similar GitOps workflow is theoretically possible for Docker, even if it supports a lot less features than Kubernetes\nout of the box. SwarmCD is a project aiming at giving the same kind of experience for\nDocker Swarm that FluxCD or ArgoCD are giving for Kubernetes (i.e. a GitOps workflow, basically). I'm currently using an\nexperimental branch of that project, and even contributed to add support for some of my specific workflows. It is\nstill far from something like FluxCD, but provides really interesting functionality. Just like with Talos, I can use Terraform\nto deploy and kickstart SwarmCD.\n\nAnother thing that motivated me to move to a more powerful server is the ability to run local AI models.\nI had three use cases in mind:\n\nI bought a used RTX 3060 12 GB for cheap (on Leboncoin as well), but of course it didn't fit in my SFF server. I used another computer\nfor a while, and only powered it on for experiments. I feel like I'm ready to have some of it more permanent (for example, a tiny model connected to Home Assistant), and the R740 had space for that GPU, which is great. I can also add a lot of system RAM, which\nis unfortunately necessary for most interesting models.\n\nThe RTX 3060 12GB installed inside the R740 server (top left). I had to buy a specific power cable that goes from the motherboard to the GPU (not shown here).\n\nIt has been a wonderful journey!\n\nFrom a simple Raspberry Pi with defaults SSH/web/FTP servers, I went to a real home server where I could natively deploy\napplications. It then evolved into a Proxmox server, where I learned about virtualization and system containers. I also\nlearned about Docker, and then Kubernetes, GitOps, and IaC.\n\nPassmark benchmark score for different servers of my Homelab, as well as my laptops for comparison\n\nI'm now using a full-blown rack server, but I'm not sure I'll stop there. Some people are\nbecoming their own internet service provider / autonomous system,\ndoing crazy home automation, or even have a multi-site homelab.\n\nI would really like to try all of that, but I'm currently finishing migration to the new server and learning about\nIPv6 and related technologies (NAT64, ...). My issue with IPv6 right now is that my ISP does give me a prefix, but I cannot delegate it to my router (the ISP-provided box does not support prefix delegation); which is something I will need to work around.\n\nI still have a lot to learn and a lot to do to make my homelab clean.\n\nYou can follow/check out everything on my homeprod repository!",

    "title": "Logarithmic Scales of Pleasure and Pain (2019)",
    "description": "TL;DR\nBased on: the characteristic distribution of neural activity, personal accounts of intense pleasure and pain, the way various pain scales have…",
    "fullText": "Thank for commenting. First of all I agree that the claims of (A) and (B) do need to be distinguished, and I admit I didn't make that conceptual distinction very clear in the article. I agree that the most important takeaway from the piece is (B), and I also think that this alone is already enough to challenge EA's prioritization methods (i.e. ultra-painful experiences are completely flying under the radar from the point of view of QALYs and similar metrics; reducing the incidence of cluster headaches, migraines, kidney stones, etc. could be an extremely cost-effective EA objective).\n\nWith that said, I would claim that (1) the article does actually provide evidence for (A), (2) taking this seriously clarifies a lot of puzzling facts about experience and how it is reported, and (3) understanding that pain and pleasure follows a long-tail (most likely a log-normal distribution) gives us a new principled way to approach cause prioritization.\n\nI understand the fact that the pain scales of stings and cluster headaches are *by construction* logarithmic. But you have to understand that such a scale would only ever be \"filled to the top\" if experiences actually differed in intensity also by the same amount. The article (and presentation, which I strongly recommend you watch) explain that all of the following are consistent with the pain scales (as reported!) are actually logarithmic:\n\n(a) the characteristic distribution of neural activity is log-normal, and under the modest assumption that intensity of experience is roughly proportional (or at least polynomially proportional) to intensity of experience, that entails the distribution of intensity is also log-normal.\n\n(b) the above can be further understood as a kind of \"neuronal weather\" (see the \"avalanches\" metaphor in the video presentation)\n\n(c1) there are few categories of experiences that capture most of the extremely good and extremely bad sensations\n\n(c2) there is consistency in the deference judgements of the quality of experience (as seen in the deference graph), and importantly\n\n(c3) The ratio of \"1st worst or best experience vs. 2nd worst or best experience\" fits a log-normal distribution and it does not fit a normal distribution.\n\nFor the above reasons, bringing up the Fechner-Weber is not, I would claim, a red-herring. Rather, I think it ties together the whole argument. Here is why:\n\nI understand that Fechner-Weber's law maps physical intensity to subjective intensity, and that valence is not externally driven a lot of the time. But you may have missed the argument I'm making here. And that is that in one interpretation of the law, a pre-conscious process does a log transform on the intensity of the input and that by the time we are aware of it, what we become aware of are the linear differences in our experience. In the alternate interpretation of the law, which I propose, the senses (within the window of adaptation) translate the intensity of the input into an equivalent intensity of experience. And the reason *why* we can only detect multiplicative differences in the input *is because* we can only notice consciously multiplicative differences in the intensity of experience. Do you see what I am saying? In this account, the fact that people would naturally and spontaneously use a logarithmic scale to report their level of pain is a simple implication of the fact that you can only definitively tell that \"the pain got worse\" when it got 10% worse and not when it became 1 unit worse (which soon becomes hard to notice when you talk about experiences with e.g. 1000 pain units per second).\n\nIn other words, the scales are logarithmic because we can only notice with confidence multiplicative increments in the intensity of experience. And while this is fine and does not seem to have strong implications on the lower end of the scale, it very quickly escalates, to the point where by the time you are in 7/10 pain you live in a world with orders of magnitude more pain units per second than you did when you were in 2/10 pain.\n\nFinally, you really need the logarithmic scales to make room for the ultra-intense levels of pleasure and pain that I highlighted in the \"existence of extremes\" section. If people reported their pain on a linear scale, they would quickly run into the problem that they cannot describe even something as painful as a broken bone, let along something like a cluster headache.",

    "fullText": "A Wall Street veteran warned jubilant silver traders to be careful after a searing rally in the precious metal's price — days before it went into reverse.\n\nWriting on X over the weekend, Peter Brandt congratulated those who've won big by betting on silver and platinum in recent months, but cautioned the market could quickly turn on them.\n\n\"Being right is fun,\" he wrote. \"But know this -- moves can far exceed anything expected. And tops come quickly when they come. And retracements are almost always full.\"\n\nEarly on Monday, the market did indeed turn. Silver breached $80 an ounce for the first time before falling to around $70 by the market's close. They rebounded 10% to around $78 on Tuesday. Silver futures have surged by over 150% this year.\n\nMonday's plunge followed a decision by exchange operator CME to raise margin requirements for trading various metals contracts, which forced traders to stump up more cash to place their bets.\n\nIf you are long Silver and/or Platinum, I say \"Well done.\"\nCongrats. Perhaps this is your first futures market trade. Being right is fun.\nBut know this -- moves can far exceed anything expected\nAnd tops come quickly when they come\nAnd retracements are almost always full pic.twitter.com/w32o9OuXKj\n\nBrandt, who's been trading commodities for nearly 50 years and has more than 840,000 followers on X, also struck a wary tone in a Monday afternoon post on X following silver's drop.\n\nHe wrote that in virtually every market cycle, even the \"stubborn bulls\" who've sworn they'll never sell inevitably reach a point where they \"no longer care if price goes to zero or a million, they have had enough pain and they want out.\"\n\nBrandt said he's \"not sure\" the silver market is there yet. \"Time will tell,\" he added.\n\nTrue story\nI've been through many many many huge bull market cycles in metals, grains, softs, livestock, alt coins, et al\nThere is a point when late-to-buy bulls swear that they will never get out -- that they will hang on even if price goes to zero\nIn almost every case the low…\n\nSilver, gold, and other precious metals have soared to new highs this year as falling interest rates have boosted their appeal relative to cash and bonds.\n\nSome traders have bought silver to gain exposure to the AI boom, as the metal is a key component in AI infrastructure, such as microchips and data centers. Because it conducts electricity well, it's used in circuit boards, switches, EVs, and batteries, which is also driving demand for the metal right now.\n\nInvestors have also piled into precious metals as hedges against geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty, which threatens to weaken currencies such as the dollar and weigh on other assets such as stocks.\n\nIn a separate post late Monday on X, Brandt defended his cautious attitude toward the silver rally, noting that he has been trading silver since it was priced below $4 an ounce in the 1970s and has traded as much as 200,000 ounces in a single order.\n\n\"Yet, I am jealous because there is an entire generation of Z babies trading on Silver on laptops from their mommy's basements that know everything there is to know about Silver,\" he posted, followed by a succession of laughing-while-crying emojis.\n\nBrandt also dismissed the idea that silver's price boom reflects a structural imbalance between supply and demand that will forestall any price decline.\n\n\"It has never been different,\" he wrote. \"Never will be. So enjoy it now.\"\n\n\"This price action has NOTHING to do with supply shortages,\" he wrote in another post. \"This now is a game of money.\"",

    "title": "Inside the rise, fall, and resurrection of Toys R Us, the chain that once commanded a quarter of the toy market",
    "description": "Toys R Us has been the subject of multiple revival efforts since it ended operations in 2018.",
    "fullText": "The latest phase of the toy store chain's comeback came this holiday season as Toys R Us stores popped up at a handful of malls around the US. The temporary stores are part of a broader revitalization opportunity by brand management company WHP and Go! Retail Group.\n\nIt's the latest example of how the once-dominant chain is trying to make a comeback.\n\nToys R Us used to operate around 700 stores in the US. Then, after years of faltering financial results, the chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy before deciding to liquidate and close its operations in 2018.\n\nSince then, there have been multiple efforts to revive the brand, including opening locations within Macy's department stores and teaming up with Amazon.\n\nHere's a closer look at the history of the historic toy company, from its founding just after World War 2 to the revival attempt.\n\nLazarus was inspired by what was then the emerging post-war \"baby boom\" and sought a way to capitalize.\n\nIn the subsequent years, Lazarus began expanding into toys and the company officially adopted the name Toys R Us in 1957.\n\nKids and their parents would line up for hours to meet their favorite stars — and do a little shopping while they were there.\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia.com, he transitioned from chief executive to head the Toys R Us division, which was already thriving at profits of $12 million.\n\nThe mascot became synonymous with the brand and its advertising campaigns over the decades.\n\nLazarus handled the restructuring process, according to USA Today.\n\nIn 1978, it was able to file its initial public offering.\n\nThe Toys R Us empire was steadily expanding.\n\nThe move signified a series of woes for the brand, including high executive turnover and the looming pressure of ecommerce.\n\nThe stores saw success with selling baby-related merchandise.\n\nIn the Big Apple, Toys R Us opened its iconic multi-story store with a fully functioning Ferris wheel in 2001.\n\nIn fact, according to The Associated Press, in 1998, Walmart had already surpassed the company as the top US toy seller.\n\nAll 146 Kids R Us stores were closed in 2003.\n\nAccording to USA Today, the plan was to boost Toys R Us sales and position the company for a stock offering that would allow investors to cash out.\n\nThat same year, it bought KB Toys and the famed New York City toy store, F.A.O. Schwarz.\n\nHowever, by 2013 it withdrew from the process due to sales slumps, according to USA Today.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Brandon marked the fourth CEO over the course of 16 years \"tasked with turning the company around.\"\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the chain lost significant traction to ecommerce giants like Amazon, Target, and Walmart.\n\nThe chain hoped to gain control of its debt and continue to operate its 1,600 stores around the world as normal, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the decision threatened the jobs of the 33,000 people employed by Toys R Us at the time.\n\nThat same year, the company issued an emotional goodbye as it prepared to permanently shutter its Toys R Us and Babies R Us websites.\n\n\"We encourage you to stop by your local store and take full advantage of the deep discounts and deals available,\" the message read. \"Thank you for your business and support over the years.\"\n\nIt was later announced that gift-card holders could use any remaining funds at Bed Bath & Beyond stores, according to Business Insider.\n\nHowever, the offer was ultimately rejected by Toys R Us.\n\nThe chain strategized to overtake Toys R Us's legacy by adding mass amounts of baby-related products to its inventory.\n\nThe stores would sell popular toys directly from manufacturers, meaning that any sales would directly go to the toy companies rather than Toys R Us.\n\nInstead, users would be directed to make purchases from Target's website.\n\nThe haunted houses were a far cry from the joy-filled Toys R Us stores of the 1990s.\n\nCNBC reported in January 2021 that the retailer was facing hardships due to dwindling in-store sales amid the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the chain's last two remaining stores in the US officially shuttered for good, bringing an end to a years-long ordeal to attempt to revitalize the brand.\n\nThe final stores were in Texas and New Jersey, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\"Consumer demand in the toy category and for Toys 'R' Us remains strong and we will continue to invest in the channels where the customer wants to experience our brand,\" a Tru Kids spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nThe Toys R Us in-store locations opened in time for the holiday season that year.\n\nThe stores, operated by Go! Retail Group, include eight flagship locations and 20 seasonal pop-ups around the US.\n\nAlthough the pop-ups use the Toys R Us name and slogans, they also feature a different product selection compared to the Toys R Us stores of years past, Business Insider found during a recent visit to one store in Maryland. The store included a wide selection of calendars, for example.\n\nWhile some shoppers were able to check out the brand's pop-up stores, the chain has far fewer locations than it did a decade ago.",

    "description": "\"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary learned about the \"signal and noise\" ratio for productivity from Apple founder Steve Jobs.",
    "fullText": "\"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary has learned many things from the CEOs and world leaders he rubs shoulders with, but one of his most important daily rituals comes from an iconic innovator: Steve Jobs.\n\nO'Leary told Business Insider that a goal technique he uses every day came straight from studying the Apple founder. He picked it up after working alongside Jobs in the mid-1990s, when O'Leary's educational software company The Learning Company was working with Apple to get the Mac computer into schools.\n\n\"He believed that you needed to do three things, and you had to get them done every day,\" O'Leary said of Jobs.\n\n\"You need a ratio of at least 70% signal, which are the three things, and the 30% can be noise — whatever is going to stop you from getting the three things done,\" he continued. \"So I pick three things I want to get done that day, and I don't let anything get in the way until those three things are done.\"\n\nO'Leary said one of the three things he has to do every day is exercise. He usually wakes up at 5 a.m. and works out for over an hour, usually biking about 12 miles.\n\n\"I have to do that; otherwise, bad things happen,\" he said.\n\nOn the noise side, part of the 30% that gets in O'Leary's way is his overflowing inbox. It's become such a distraction that he's stopped trying to keep up with email.\n\n\"I don't do emails anymore because I get anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 a day,\" O'Leary said. \"I've tried every system to take the crap out, but over the years, my email address has gotten out there, and so it's just a constant stream of noise and garbage. As we speak, I see the emails just pouring in. I'm never going to get to them, so I don't try.\"\n\nThe \"Marty Supreme\" star says in his line of work, it's best to focus on what he really wants to accomplish and block out all the noise.\n\n\"In entrepreneurship, and certainly in what I do today as an investor, there is no holiday, there's no workday — that doesn't exist,\" O'Leary said. \"It's what you want to do with your time.\"",

    "title": "I tried making mac and cheese in 3 different appliances, and the tastiest dish honestly surprised me",
    "description": "Trying the recipe in the oven, on the stove, and in the microwave let me see how the appliance affected the taste, texture of the mac and cheese.",
    "fullText": "I've been using the same mac-and-cheese recipe for almost two decades.\n\nInitially, I prepared it in a huge baking tray for parties, but I've since adapted it into a one-pot, stovetop recipe. To this day, my teenage son makes it for himself at least once a week.\n\nCurious about how the flavor, texture, and cook time compared, I tested the same recipe using three different appliances: the microwave, oven, and stove.\n\nFor each method, I used an 8-ounce bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1 ½ cups of milk, one box of medium pasta shells, and 2 tablespoons of butter.\n\nThe stovetop method uses the fewest kitchen tools of the three since the cheese sauce and pasta go in the same pot, leaving me with less to clean up.\n\nTo make my mac and cheese on the stove, I started with a roux, which is a cooking staple that combines fat and flour. It helps thicken the cheese sauce, giving it a creamy consistency.\n\nAs soon as the fat and flour formed a paste, I whisked in the milk.\n\nThe key is to let the milk simmer until it starts to thicken, then whisk in the cheese over low heat. After that, I removed the sauce from the heat as soon as the cheese melted to prevent it from getting too thick.\n\nThe stovetop produced the creamiest mac and cheese. Taking the time to make the sauce first ensured that the cheese was completely melted and not stringy.\n\nI liked the sauce's thickness and the pasta's tender-but-firm consistency. Even better, the leftover stovetop mac and cheese maintained the same texture and taste when reheated.\n\nWhen I've baked mac and cheese in the past, I used at least double the amount of cheese, plus some extra milk.\n\nBut for the sake of consistency throughout the test, I stuck to the same measurements I used in the microwave and on the stovetop.\n\nI intentionally undercooked the pasta before putting it in the oven to keep it from overcooking during the baking period. Before placing it on the rack, I dotted butter on top.\n\nThen, I baked it for a total of 35 minutes (20 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered).\n\nBaking the mac and cheese gave it a rich cheese flavor and a crispy top layer. The cheese melted well, although somewhat unevenly, leaving some pieces more coated than others.\n\nI really enjoyed the flavor and consistency of the oven-baked mac and cheese the most, but it took 35 minutes to cook and didn't reheat as well as the version I made on the stovetop.\n\nWhen I've previously cooked pasta in the microwave, it took at least 10 minutes to finish, with pauses built in to mix the shells and cheese every couple of minutes.\n\nSo for this test, I decided to first boil the shells on the stove until they were slightly underdone. To make a roux alternative, I combined microwaved butter with flour, then whisked in milk I'd heated in the microwave.\n\nI mixed the ingredients in a glass bowl and microwaved the mac and cheese covered for five minutes. The cheese still hadn't melted, so I stirred it and microwaved it for another two minutes.\n\nEven though I added the extra step of boiling the pasta before microwaving it, this method felt like the lowest lift.\n\nThe microwave got the job done, but the cheese didn't melt evenly. Instead of turning into a smooth sauce, there were specks of cheese coating the pasta. This gave the mac and cheese a thick and dry consistency.\n\nWithout the stovetop cream sauce, the pasta absorbed the milk as it cooked in the microwave. It lost the cheddar cheese's sharpness (which, in my opinion, is the best part of the dish), and I thought it tasted like milk.\n\nThe oven-baked mac and cheese had the best flavor and texture when served fresh.\n\nThe downside is that it took longer to cook, and cleaning the baking dish was a serious undertaking. Even so, I'd stick with this method if I were making mac and cheese for a party since it's easy to prep.\n\nThe microwave version took about the same amount of time to cook as the stovetop mac and cheese, but it wasn't as creamy and didn't have the sharp flavor I got from the stovetop and oven.\n\nAll in all, the stovetop mac and cheese was the creamiest and did a wonderful job retaining its texture, flavor, and consistency after reheating compared to the microwave and baked mac and cheeses.\n\nIf I'm making the recipe for myself or someone else in my family and want to use minimal dishes, I'll stick to the stove.",

    "description": "Chip Wilson, Lululemon's founder, isn't afraid to speak his mind about his former company, which he still holds an 8% stake in.",
    "fullText": "Lululemon's outspoken founder is used to making headlines with his interviews.\n\nDennis \"Chip\" Wilson founded the athleisure brand in 1998 and left the company in 2013 after a series of controversial remarks. Since his departure, the 70-year-old billionaire has continued to express his opinions about the brand.\n\nWith an 8% stake in the company, Wilson's wealth remains tied to Lululemon's performance. With shares underperforming compared to its peers over the last two years and a CEO set to leave in 2026, Lululemon is facing some challenges entering the new year.\n\nOn Monday, Wilson launched a proxy battle by nominating three new board members.\n\n\"My passion for the Lululemon Athletica muse has never changed, but I know this campaign for change cannot be about me,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"It is about recommitting Lululemon to genuine creative leadership that will re-establish a brand of enduring strength.\"\n\nLululemon released a statement in response to Wilson's nominations.\n\n\"Mr. Wilson has not been involved with the company for a decade, and since his departure, Lululemon has continued to adapt to the marketplace and lead the industry, building one of the most compelling growth stories in retail,\" the company said.\n\nHere are some quotes that show what Wilson has said publicly about Lululemon since leaving the company.\n\nLululemon said in December that CEO Calvin McDonald would leave his role at the end of January 2026 and named CFO Meghan Frank and CCO André Maestrini as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement.\n\nWilson was quick to criticize the change.\n\n\"As one of the largest active shareholders of Lululemon, I am deeply concerned about what appears to be a tremendous failure by the board to competently plan for the future and manage an effective succession process,\" Wilson said in a statement the day after the company's announcement.\n\nIn his statement announcing his board nominations on December 29, Wilson said that \"shareholders have no faith\" in the current board's ability to select a new CEO.\n\nIn October, Wilson penned an ad in The Wall Street Journal to criticize the athleisure brand's performance.\n\nIn the ad, he described Lululemon's \"loss of cool,\" blaming \"financed focused CEOs\" who, he said, don't know how to attract or motivate talent or understand great products.\n\nHe also compared Lululemon's \"decline\" to a \"plane crash\" and a \"sinking ship.\"\n\n\"Lululemon forgot its muse: the woman who inspires culture, not just follows it,\" he wrote.\n\nWilson implored the brand to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\"\n\nIn a Forbes interview published in January 2024, Wilson slammed the company's ads for featuring models that he described as \"sickly,\" \"unhealthy,\" and \"not inspirational.\"\n\n\"They're trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody,\" he said. \"And I think the definition of a brand is that you're not everything to everybody.\"\n\nHe also told the publication he didn't agree with Lululemon's \"whole diversity and inclusion thing.\"\n\nWilson previously sparked controversy when he was chairman of Lululemon for other remarks that suggested Lululemon was not for everyone.\n\nIn 2013, in response to criticism about Lululemon's leggings being too sheer, he told Bloomberg TV, \"Frankly, some women's bodies just don't actually work for it … It's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it.\"\n\nHe stepped down as chairman of the company shortly after. He'd resigned as CEO in 2007.\n\n\"Chip Wilson does not speak for Lululemon, and his comments do not reflect our company views or beliefs,\" Lululemon said in a public statement around the time.\n\nWilson has been adamant that Lululemon should focus on its core demographic.\n\n\"Our success was exactly that 32-year-old single professional woman — highly disposable income, very fashionable, athletic,\" Wilson told Tony Robbins in an interview published in 2023.\n\nIn the 2023 interview with Robbins, Wilson gave Lululemon props for having an \"unbeatable\" economic engine.\n\n\"Nobody's been able to replicate the muscle of this vertical retailing model, which costs so much money to get into,\" he said.\n\nThe vertical retailing model, adopted by other athletic brands like On Running, eliminates third-party retailers like Foot Locker or Macy's from the business plan.\n\nWilson spoke in the 2023 interview with Robbins about the tension he had with board members before stepping down as chairman in 2013. He described them as \"Wall Street people\" who lacked creativity.\n\n\"Somebody in here has gotta stand for the employees. Somebody has gotta stand for the quality of the product. Nobody in here cares about it,\" Wilson said he told the board.\n\nHe said those remarks led to his departure.\n\n\"'I think you should all fire yourselves,'\" he said. \"And they fired me.\"\n\nIt is common for public companies to elect new board members regularly, and many of Lululemon's board of directors have changed since Wilson's remarks.",

Before I'd spent 140 hours on overnight trains in the US and Europe, I had no idea what to expect of my 30-hour journey from New York City to Miami in October 2021.\n\nFor my first overnight Amtrak trip, I was set on having a bed in a private space. So I spent $500 on a roomette accommodation — the cheapest private cabin I could find.\n\nThe 22.75-square-foot cabin contained two beds, a toilet, and basic amenities. Thanks to clever storage hacks, it felt like a tiny hotel room with no unused space.\n\nSee inside the most affordable Amtrak ride in a private cabin.\n\nInside the enclosed space with a sliding door, I found two seats, a table, and a bed above the seats that pulled down. The seats also pulled out into a bed.\n\nI thought this was a big step up from sitting in coach, where you get one train seat and sit with other passengers.\n\nI was also surprised to be able to control the temperature inside my roomette with a dial and air conditioning vents. I kept it cool, about 66 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFor dinner, I had braised short ribs, mashed potatoes, and a hard roll. While I didn't love the meal as it came, I made a little sandwich out of the ingredients, which tasted better to me.\n\nI decided to try sleeping on the top bed. I thought the available blankets wrapped in plastic were surprisingly soft and comfortable.\n\nWhile I found the train movement through the night a little unsettling, I appreciated the dim, blue light on the wall next to me. It was my favorite feature of the roomette because it reminded me of my colorful night light at home.\n\nAfter 30 hours in a roomette, I would book the accommodation again. But for those looking for more room to stretch out, I recommend the Amtrak bedroom.",

My reply is always to assure them it's OK, because ultimately, it is OK.\n\nGoing no contact with my mom six years ago was a difficult decision to make, but it has had an incredible impact on the way I show up as a parent to my sons, now 8 and 10.\n\nUltimately, I believe the decision to take a step back from my relationship with my mom has made me a better mother.\n\nOn the surface, my own childhood certainly looked idyllic. My dad worked, and my mom stayed home. I did well in school. I was involved. If I expressed interest in an activity, my mom signed me up. She schlepped me around town, to games and competitions, to art classes and orchestra practices. I stood out academically; my report cards always read \"a pleasure to have in class.\" I was a rule follower by nature, seemingly clinging to the order and structure that school offered me.\n\nAt home, I remember raised voices and arguments being the norm. I often busied myself with schoolwork and activities to avoid the chaos of home. It was a win-win. The adults in my life could point to my accomplishments as a sign of their success, and I could stay occupied in spaces that offered structure, praise for my efforts, and refuge from the discomfort that I remember feeling at home.\n\nNow that I'm a mother, I find myself looking back on childhood memories, discovering them colored by a new understanding of the dynamics that had played out. I can see a little girl so overwhelmed and flooded with feelings that she couldn't make sense of them.\n\nWhile I can now empathize a bit with my mother, who dealt with some extenuating circumstances that would be difficult for anyone to navigate, I also recognize that it was probably not the best environment for me to be in as a little girl.\n\nI now have a deeply feeling kid of my own, and boy, can we rile one another up. He quickly escalates when things aren't perfect, the tears and yelling so deeply familiar. I see myself in him, but it also feels different now. I know I can stop the cycle.\n\nI remember feeling such big feelings in such a small body as a child. Just like my son, the sobs came readily for me, too. Any frustration, any struggle, and it would rise in my chest, spilling out despite my best efforts. There wasn't anyone to guide me through making sense of it, but it doesn't need to be that way for my boys. I listen to them and support them.\n\nWhat I learned in unpacking my own past is that the cycle of rupture and repair doesn't have to continue. Distancing myself from my mother has made a new way of approaching life and motherhood a possibility. My job is to model regulation and support my sons, even when their feelings and struggles are hard.\n\nWhile I no longer resent my mom, I do wish she had done the work to save me from the burden I carried for so long. I hope that eventually my sons can look back and appreciate the work I'm putting in every day to make sure we have a long, healthy relationship that has us enjoying each other's company for many years.",

    "description": "After months of trying for a baby, Brian Mazza learned he had a low sperm count. He turned to IVF and now speaks openly about male infertility.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on an interview with Brian Mazza, 41, who has appeared on the cover of \"Men's Health.\" Mazza was recently named \"Champion for Male Fertility Advocacy\" by the World Fertility Awards. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore we got married in 2014, my wife, Chloe Melas, a journalist, and I were very much aligned on wanting children in the future. It's a huge step for anybody in a relationship, but we agreed that it would be great to start a family together.\n\nThen, around a year after the wedding, we tried to get pregnant — without success.\n\nThe sense of disappointment each month was challenging and disheartening. Like anything else in life you want to accomplish, it becomes frustrating when it's not working out.\n\nIt wasn't ideal for both of us and caused a lot of issues, which weren't fun. It was a strain and kind of brutal.\n\nFortunately, we were able to find a good, straight-talking doctor who ran a series of tests. Chloe was found to have a diminished ovarian reserve, but they wanted to check me out, too.\n\nIt was awkward and strange. Everybody in the waiting room knew why you were there, which was fine, but then you were ushered into a room next to the secretary's desk. It felt a bit strange.\n\nMy test was back in 2016. Thankfully, there are now a lot of companies that allow you to sort everything out in your own home.\n\nThe results showed I had a low sperm count, which proved to be the primary cause of the issues. If someone asked if I felt guilty, embarrassed, or was worried that Chloe was resentful toward me, I'd answer yes.\n\nI was extremely fit, eating well, and doing everything to meet the expectations of an elite performer in life. I thought, \"What is getting in the way of this goal?\"\n\nI began to wonder if I'd done something in the past that was responsible. It wasn't the case, but I wanted to look at the full road map.\n\nThen, since I've always been a problem solver and a reverse engineer, I thought, \"How can we approach the situation?\"\n\nWe had no luck with intrauterine insemination (IUI) and moved on to IVF. The process was pretty easy from a male perspective because you are physically removed.\n\nStill, I went to every doctor's appointment to listen to the advice. It was hard to see Chloe go through what she did, but we tried to focus on the end result.\n\nWe didn't share our journey with family or friends at the time. It was to protect the situation and not feel like we were letting people down.\n\nThankfully, we got pregnant on our first round of IVF. We were thrilled, and it turned into elation when our son, Leo, was born in July 2017.\n\nWe went through the same process, and Luke arrived exactly two years later.\n\nHolding Leo and Luke in my arms was every dream that I'd ever dreamed. I'd wanted to become a father so much.\n\nI'm speaking up about male factor infertility because it's a topic that should be openly discussed. I hope that I'm helping to remove the stigma. It's useful when someone who has been through an experience like ours can share their story.\n\nAs the years pass, I find myself gazing at my boys — now 8 and 6 — with joy and wonder. They're bright, athletic, and kind. Chloe and I call them our miracles.",

    "description": "The younger members of the Kennedy family, one of the most famous political dynasties in the US, include authors, actors, and journalists.",
    "fullText": "The younger members of the Kennedy family, one of the most famous political dynasties in the US, include authors, actors, and journalists.\n\nThe most famous members of the Kennedy family include former president John F. Kennedy, his wife and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and their son John F. Kennedy Jr, who tragically died in a plane crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in 1999 with his wife and sister-in-law.\n\nHowever, younger members of the Kennedy family, from the Schlossbergs to the Schwarzeneggers, have risen the ranks of American politics and are making names for themselves in film, philanthropy, and politics.\n\nHere are 12 young members of the Kennedy family.\n\nJoe Kennedy III, 45, is the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nIn 2020, Kennedy, who attended Stanford University for his undergrad and Harvard Law School, lost the senate primary against Ed Markey, becoming the first Kennedy to lose an election in Massachusetts history.\n\nStill, he'd go on to serve as a United States representative for Massachusetts from 2013 to 2021 and he held the position of United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland from 2022 to 2024.\n\nKennedy first came to national attention in 2018 when he gave the Democratic Party's response to former President Donald Trump's State of the Union address.\n\nKennedy served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee while representing Massachusetts's 4th congressional district.\n\nHe supported Democratic efforts like the Green New Deal and protection for Dreamers and immigrants under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program.\n\nHe's also spoken out in favor of gun control. After a 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Kennedy said during an appearance on The View, \"We're not doing enough ... I can't even tell you how many times we have uttered our thoughts and prayers to the victims and survivors of gun violence, and thoughts aren't doing it.\"\n\nIn December 2012, he married Lauren Birchfield, a fellow Harvard-educated lawyer. The pair met in a Harvard Law School class taught by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and they now live in Newton, Massachusetts, with their two young children, CBS reported.\n\nHis twin brother, Matthew Rauch Kennedy, has stayed more out of the public eye, opting to study business instead, CNN reported.\n\nKatherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, 35, is the oldest daughter of actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and broadcast journalist Maria Shriver. Pratt's middle name, Eunice, is a nod to her maternal grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the younger sister of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Ted Kennedy.\n\nPratt has written several self-help and children's books, including her upcoming release, \"Kat and Brandy,\" which was inspired by her experience falling off a horse as a child.\n\nIn addition to writing, she is involved in animal rights advocacy and is an ambassador for Best Friends Animal Society and the ASPCA, according to her website. She's a dog mom to a rescue named Maverick, who inspired her first children's book, \"Maverick and Me.\"\n\nPratt's private life has also been a topic of interest in the press. She's married to actor Chris Pratt. Their first child, Lyla Maria, was born in August 2020, and their second daughter, Eloise Christina, was born in May 2022. The couple welcomed their son Ford in November 2024.\n\nPatrick Schwarzenegger, 32, is a model and actor who has appeared in many movies, TV shows, and music videos, including \"Midnight Sun,\" \"The Staircase, and \"Gen V.\" In 2019, he acted in the psychological horror film \"Daniel Isn't Real,\" produced by Elijah Wood. The movie also starred Miles Robbins, Susan Sarandon's son.\n\nMore recently, he had a starring role in season three of \"The White Lotus.\" He played Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family on vacation in Thailand.\n\nHe's also known for his brief relationship with Miley Cyrus in 2015. He's now married to model Abby Champion.\n\nSchlossberg, 32, is the youngest son of Caroline Kennedy, the former US ambassador to Japan and the only surviving child of John F. Kennedy, and Edwin Schlossberg, a designer and author.\n\nIn November, he announced would be campaigning for a congressional seat in New York City's 12th district.\n\n\"I'm not running because I have all the answers to our problems,\" he said in a video announcing his candidacy. \"I'm running because the people of New York 12 do. I want to listen to your struggles, hear your stories, amplify your voice, go to Washington, and execute on your behalf.\"\n\nHe was born in New York City and graduated from The Collegiate School, an all-boys private school in Manhattan, the New York Post reported. He later attended Yale University as an undergrad, and he graduated from Harvard in 2022. In 2023, Schlossberg told People he had passed the New York State Bar exam.\n\nSchlossberg makes frequent media appearances and has written for publications, with op-eds in The New York Times and The Washington Post.\n\n\"I'm inspired by my family's legacy of public service,\" Schlossberg said in his first live television interview on \"Today\" in 2017. \"It's something that I'm very proud of.\"\n\nHowever, Schlossberg has been criticized in recent years for his out-there videos on social media, with even some family members criticizing his \"trolling,\" particularly of his cousin Robert F. Kennedy, online, The New York Post reported.\n\n\"I hope he gets the help he needs,\" Kennedy's daughter, Kathleen \"Kick\" Kennedy, told The Post in February.\n\nTatiana Schlossberg died on December 30, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation announced. She was 35.\n\nIn November, Schlossberg wrote an essay for The New Yorker in which she shared that she had been diagnosed with terminal acute myeloid leukemia. Her cancer diagnosis was discovered by her doctor after she gave birth to her daughter in May 2024.\n\n\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" she wrote in the essay. \"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"\n\nSchlossberg graduated from the University of Oxford in England with a US history degree in 2014. She worked as a journalist covering the climate crisis for the New York Times science desk until 2023. She later freelanced for several publications.\n\nShe released a book titled \"Inconspicuous Consumption\" in 2019 that Vogue called \"a plucky exploration of the myriad ways our casual lifestyle choices come at the expense of the planet and our fellow human beings.\"\n\nTatiana married her college boyfriend, George Moran, a medical student, in 2017 at her family's estate on Martha's Vineyard.\n\nThey welcomed a son, Edwin Garrett Moran, in April 2022. He is the first great-grandchild of John F. Kennedy.

Her most recent acting credits include roles in the short film \"Small Gay Tragedy #1\" and the upcoming television series \"End Times Girls Club.\"\n\nShe has been married to her wife, restaurateur Rory McAuliffe, since 2022.\n\nNamed for her great-aunt who died in a plane crash, Kathleen \"Kick\" Kennedy, 37, is the eldest daughter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Emily Ruth Black, his first wife and the mother of his two oldest children. They separated in 1993.\n\nShe's a member of the founders' circle for the nonprofit Well Beings, which, according to its mission statement, is dedicated to improving \"the well-being of animals, people, and the planet.\"\n\nKick drew media attention in 2024 after reports surfaced that she was spending time with Ben Affleck following his high-profile divorce from Jennifer Lopez.\n\nAfter Page Six reported that the two had been spotted together at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel, Affleck's representative told People the two weren't dating.\n\nKyra Kennedy, 30, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nIn 2016, Harper's Bazaar wrote that Kyra, then 21, was \"the latest Kennedy making headlines\" after making her formal debut in society at a 2013 debutante ball in Paris. The outlet also reported that she was a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology.\n\nThe New York Times also profiled her social circle that year, dubbing Kyra \"a statuesque beauty\" and a member of the so-called \"Snap Pack,\" named for their frequent use of Snapchat to document nights out on the town. The group included people like Gaia Matisse, the great-granddaughter of artist Henri Matisse, and Tiffany Trump.\n\nKyra has dabbled in modeling, posing for her friend and fellow Snap Pack member Andrew Warren's clothing line during New York Fashion Week in May 2016.\n\nAccording to her Instagram, she frequently attends brand pop-ups, fashion shows, and events during Fashion Week.\n\nBobby Kennedy III, 41, is the son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Emily Ruth Black. He is the grandson and namesake of Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated on June 6, 1968.\n\nHe wrote, directed, and acted in the 2013 film \"AmeriQua,\" which was retitled \"Eurotrapped\" for home-streaming services. He starred opposite Alec Baldwin and Alessandra Carina Mastronardi in the film, which earned a dismal 1-star rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nPeople reported that in July 2018, he married Amaryllis Fox, a former CIA agent, at the Kennedy family compound in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.\n\nIn January 2019, the couple welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Bobby, also named for her great-grandfather, People reported.\n\nCara Kennedy-Cuomo, 30, attended Harvard for her undergraduate studies and lived in New York City.

    "description": "Bill Ackman, Palmer Luckey, Garry Tan, and more are sharing their opinions on a California billionaire tax proposal.",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names in business are speaking up about California's billionaire tax proposal.\n\nThe measure proposed a one-time 5% tax for California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it would appear on the state ballot in November.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nProposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union, the bill attempts to fill a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of the biggest companies — in both value and prestige — in the US. The state boasts Hollywood and Silicon Valley, although some of the industries' key players have relocated.\n\nIn a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom obtained by Business Insider, attorney Alex Spiro wrote that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax becomes law. Spiro has previously represented billionaires and celebrities.\n\nHere's how several business leaders and politicians have reacted to the tax proposal:\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Holdings wrote Monday on X that he was \"opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property,\" which can have \"unintended and negative consequences.\"\n\nHowever, he said he's in favor of a \"fairer tax system.\"\n\nFor example, Ackman wrote that an individual who had amassed a billion dollars or \n\n\"One shouldn't be able to live and spend like a billionaire and pay no tax,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nAs for California's \"budget problems,\" Ackman wrote that the issue wasn't a lack of tax revenue — it was about \"how the money is being spent.\"\n\nThe White House AI and crypto czar took aim at California's government in an X post on Sunday.\n\nRed states like Texas and Florida don't employ state income taxes, let alone wealth taxes, Sacks wrote. \"Democrats steal everything, then blame job creators for their 'greed,'\" he wrote.\n\nSacks said in an October episode of the \"All-In\" podcast, which he cohosts, that a wealth tax \"always backfires,\" because tax benefits are outweighed by wealthy residents leaving.\n\nSacks threatened to leave the state, analogizing steady tax increases to boiling a frog on the podcast.\n\n\"I'm going to have to jump out of the pot with this,\" he said.\n\nThe Congressman for California's 17th district, which covers much of Silicon Valley, said that the proposal was \"good for American innovation.\"\n\nAfter receiving thousands of comments on a Friday post bidding a sarcastic goodbye to those threatening to leave the state, Khanna explained his support in a seven-paragraph X post on Saturday.\n\nHe wrote that Nvidia would be built all over again, even with the wealth tax.\n\n\"Jensen [Huang] wasn't thinking I won't start this company because I may have to one day pay a 1% tax on my billions,\" Khanna wrote. \"He built here because the talent is here.\"\n\nKhanna argued that innovation would be further stifled by the \"political dysfunction and social unrest\" that comes with wide wealth gaps.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, wrote that the representative has \"always supported a modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have healthcare.\"\n\n\"He has advocated for common sense workarounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock,\" Drory wrote.\n\nThe Oculus founder and Anduril cofounder wrote in a Sunday X post that the tax would force founders to \"sell huge chunks of our companies.\"\n\nLuckey wrote that he made money from Oculus — which he sold to Facebook in 2014 — and paid millions in taxes on it. Then he used the \"remainder\" to start Anduril, he wrote.\n\n\"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash,\" Luckey wrote.\n\nLuckey also wrote that the policy made no provision for companies that funnel revenue back to research and development, rather than paying cash incomes sizable enough to cover the tax.\n\n\"You are effectively forcing companies to immediately pivot into profit obsession over mission or long-term sustainability,\" he wrote.\n\nThe CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in a Saturday X post that the tax would \"kill little tech in California.\"\n\nUnicorn startup founders become a \"paper billionaire\" — as in, having cash on hand — around the $5 billion valuation point, Tan wrote.\n\nThe proposed tax is on unrealized gains, meaning founders would be put on the line even before their wealth is liquid, Tan wrote.\n\nIf the tax passed, Tan wrote that Y Combinator would consider opening Austin or Cambridge programs.\n\nThe Vermont senator has long been a proponent of taxes on the wealthy, introducing a bill in 2019 that aimed to halve the wealth of billionaires over a 15-year period.\n\nWhile Sanders didn't explicitly comment on the California proposal, he posted Monday on X broadly supporting wealth taxes.\n\n\"We can respect innovation & entrepreneurship, but we cannot respect the extraordinary greed that now exists,\" Sanders wrote. \"We need a wealth tax.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO reposted another user's X post that commented on the tax, saying that his stocks weren't wealth.\n\nMusk wrote in his Tuesday post that his \"wealth\" was mostly tied up in Tesla and SpaceX shares.\n\n\"This means my 'wealth' can only increase due to producing more products and services for the public,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile not directly commenting on the California tax, Musk wrote that he was a \"maker,\" unlike \"taker\" politicians like Sanders.\n\nMusk said in 2020 that he had moved from California to Texas.\n\nThe governor of California has spoken against the wealth tax. At The New York Times' Dealbook conference in December, Newsom said that California had to stay competitive with other states.\n\n\"People of that status, they already have two or three homes outside the state,\" he said. \"You've got to be pragmatic about it.\"\n\nIf the tax passes as a ballot measure, Newsom would not have the ability to veto it.",

She was known for her book \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have\" and her work as a science and climate reporter for The New York Times until she left the paper in 2017.\n\nShe said in her essay that she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer after doctors noticed her white blood cell count looked \"strange.\" She was shocked by the diagnosis.\n\n\"I didn't feel sick,\" she wrote. \"I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew. I regularly ran five to ten miles in Central Park. I once swam three miles across the Hudson River—eerily, to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\"\n\nOver the past year and a half, she received various cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, a bone-marrow transplant from her sister, and CAR-T immunotherapy.\n\nIn her November essay, she also spoke out against her cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whom she called an \"embarrassment\" to her family. As health secretary, Kennedy has cut research funding for mRNA vaccines that could be used to fight cancer, and sowed doubt about routine vaccines, which are critically important for cancer patients with weakened immune systems.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, urologist Dr. George Moran, toddler son Edwin, and a 1-year-old daughter.",

    "fullText": "China's missile arsenal is expanding rapidly, and new maps and data from the Pentagon show its size and reach.\n\nChina's missile branch, known as the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, has seen substantial growth in recent years as Beijing builds new platforms for conventional and nuclear strike. Its capabilities threaten US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nThe latest Pentagon report on China's military offers estimates for the number of launchers and missiles in the Chinese arsenal, including the country's intercontinental ballistic missiles, key parts of its nuclear deterrent.\n\nChinese ICBMs include missiles like the DF-5 and DF-41. The Pentagon estimates China has 550 ICBM launchers and 400 missiles with estimated ranges beyond 5,500 km, the threshold for classification as an ICBM.\n\nFor China's medium-range ballistic missiles, such as China's DF-21s or hypersonic DF-17, the Pentagon assesses that China has 300 launchers for 1,300 missiles with ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 km. The report also documented increases in the number of launchers and missiles for some notable systems. China's intermediate-range ballistic missiles, like the DF-26 missile, jumped from 250 launchers in last year's report to 300 this year, and the number of IRBMs total went from 500 to 550.\n\nThese figures illustrate how heavily Beijing has invested in a powerful, diverse missile arsenal. The Pentagon highlighted in its report that the Rocket Force could play an important role in a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or other regional conflict.\n\nAccording to the latest report, China's rocket force \"is prepared to conduct missile attacks against high-value targets, including Taiwan's C2 [command and control] facilities, air bases, and radar sites\" as well as deter or delay the US or its allies and partners from coming to Taiwan's aid.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the Rocket Force has continued to rehearse strikes in recent military exercises, including 2024 drills simulating an invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nOne map in the report shows the estimated reach of Chinese missiles that could be particularly relevant in a fight over Taiwan, weapons such as ship- and shore-launched surface-to-air missiles for knocking out hostile aircraft, as well as anti-ship cruise missiles fired from naval platforms like Chinese destroyers and land-based close- and short-range ballistic missiles.\n\nAnother Pentagon map shows the estimated reach of China's conventional strike missiles, including the DF-17 and DF-21 MRBMs, the DF-26 IRBM, and the newly fielded DF-27 ICBM, which, like the DF-26 and some DF-21s, has an anti-ship role in addition to land attack.\n\nMany of these systems can reach across the first island chain, which includes Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, while longer-range missiles extend toward the second island chain and beyond.\n\nThe DF-26 is concerning for US planners. The weapon, nicknamed the \"Guam Express,\" can be armed with either conventional or nuclear warheads and reach US installations on Guam. It can target US aircraft carriers and other surface ships as well.\n\nBombers, like China's H-6, carrying CJ-20 cruise missiles could threaten parts of Alaska. And then the ICBMs can range significantly further. The DF-27 can, for instance, range parts of the continental United States.\n\nThe Department of Defense report also looks at China's nuclear strike options, such as land-based ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\n\nChina test-launched an ICBM, specifically a DF-31B missile, in September 2024, firing it from a position on Hainan Island into the Pacific. The test was the first beyond the country's borders since the 1980s and allowed China to verify ICBM performance. The Department of Defense suspects weapons tests like these may become more regular.\n\nThis year, at a military parade in Beijing, China unveiled new, previously unseen ICBMs, shocking China watchers. Those weapons, including the new DF-61 and DF-31BJ, are not included in the Pentagon's assessments.\n\nChina also continues to bolster its nuclear warhead count, estimated at over 600 warheads. Although 2024 saw a slower rate of production than previous years, the Pentagon still assesses that the Chinese military is on its way to 1,000 warheads by 2030, only a fraction of the US and Russian stockpiles.\n\nA Pentagon map estimating the ranges of Chinese missiles available for nuclear strike indicates that three — the DF-5, DF-41, and DF-31 — all have the continental US well within range, while the submarine-launched JL-3 missile can hit most of it from waters near China. On a submarine positioned farther out, more targets could be within striking distance.\n\nDespite these continued advancements, questions remain on the differences in quality and capabilities of Chinese weapons and training compared to the US. The Pentagon also believes China is still navigating the impacts of a vast anti-corruption campaign in the military that has particularly targeted PLARF officials.\n\nThe campaign could be detrimental if driven by political agendas, or it could deliver long-term improvements if it addresses actual problems within the force. At this point, it's unclear how the changes will affect it.",

    "fullText": "Marriott International (MAR), one of the world’s largest hotel chains, had a year of notable achievements and a few setbacks. The chain behind brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, and JW Marriott operates more than 30 brands and nearly 9,600 properties in 143 countries and territories.\n\nIn 2025, in just one quarter, Marriott added 120 properties and 17,903 rooms, focusing on its asset-light franchising segment, according to analyst Daniel Javier for Seeking Alpha. Luxury offerings remained a priority, with 26 new hotels opening in India and 1,900 rooms added to its portfolio.\n\nHowever, Marriott also faced controversy. In November, the Maasai ethnic group filed a lawsuit to demolish a new Ritz-Carlton luxury safari camp, claiming it blocks a key Serengeti wildlife migration route.\n\nMeanwhile, a Fairfield by Marriott posted a sign stating that complimentary bottled water isn’t included, even for elite members, unless they select a “market item,” drawing mockery online, according to Veronika Bondarenko of TheStreet.\n\nMore recently, Marriott caused guest backlash with a new ban.\n\nThe New Orleans Marriott Warehouse Arts District caught attention from guests due to a sign saying “Benches are for Marriott employees only.”\n\nThe hotel is located in a 19th-century warehouse, close to the French Quarter,  the New Orleans Garden District, and the Central Business District.\n\n“Our New Orleans hotel in the downtown area enjoys an excellent location across the street from the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. Host events from 26,636 square feet of revamped event space and fuel up for the day ahead at our full-service Starbucks,” reads the description on Marriott's hotel page.\n\nThe benches in question are part of the hotel’s common area and are easily accessible by the public, which Marriott appears to prefer the public not use. A sign noting that the benches are for employee-only use is next to “No Smoking” and “No Loitering” plastered on the red brick wall, writes The Travel.\n\nDoes the sign mean that hotel guests, no matter their status, aren’t welcome to use the benches?\n\nWhile the water bottle incident is clear, as the hotel giant plainly states that  complimentary bottled water isn’t included unless guests select a “market item,” the sign designating benches only for employees is somewhat confusing.\n\nView from the Wing’s Gary Leff, a recognized expert in miles, points, and business travel, believes that the New Orleans Marriott sign “employees only” isn’t really about keeping guests out, but instead is meant to prevent loitering, smoking, panhandling, and other security issues near the entrance.\n\n“This sign is almost certainly not about guests. It’s in New Orleans. It’s about loitering control. They’re also flagging NO LOITERING and NO SMOKING. That says, we’ve had people hanging out here who aren’t supposed to be here and we want them gone,” writes Leff for View from the Wing.\n\nWhile the intent was maintaining security and staff space, the sign gives a poor impression of hospitality and might have been handled more tactfully with design changes, such as divided benches or better lighting.\n\nLeff further notes that the sign is not ideal for either guests or staff, as guests feel like they are not welcomed, and staff get a message along the lines that their breakout area is out on the sidewalk, under a \"No Loitering\" sign.\n\nOnline readers also weighed in on Marriott’s approach, providing insight into guest perceptions.\n\nIn the comment section of View from the Wing, one reader expressed frustration with the signage, noting it may not deter loitering effectively. While anecdotal, these reactions illustrate how guests perceive the policy.\n\nUser Mantis wrote, “...Now there’s a sign, oh my…that will surely solve the problem.”\n\nA user with a spontaneous username \"This comes to mind\" suggested a more precise sign: “For employees and currently registered guests only.”\n\nOther guests suggested the hotel could have hired a doorman, while another noted that a sign is less expensive.\n\nOverall, comments suggest that a world-class hotel brand such as Marriott could have managed the situation more subtly with alternative signage or layout changes.\n\nWhile guest reactions to the new policies highlight struggles in hospitality and brand perception, Marriott’s broader business operations in 2025 confirm both resilience and growth. Despite occasional controversies, the hotel giant continues to expand its portfolio, dominate new markets, launch special deals for its loyal members and deliver strong financial results.\n\nGrowth: Marriott added nearly 17,900 rooms in Q3 2025, reached a record pipeline, and returned $3.1 billion to shareholders, as reported in Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nInternational strength: International and higher-end markets continued to outperform the U.S. and Canada in RevPAR, as per Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nResidential expansion: Marriott expanded its branded residential portfolio across EMEA, signing nearly 20 new deals in 2025, according to Marriott’s official press release.\n\nNew brands: Marriott launched Series by Marriott and hit 100 City Express signings in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nAfrica plans: Marriott plans to add 50+ properties and 9,000 rooms in Africa by 2027. \n\nSonder fallout: Marriott ended its licensing deal with Sonder, which later filed for bankruptcy, causing customer and employee disruption, reported TheStreet.\n\nCost & loyalty pressures: Rising loyalty program costs and OTA commissions challenged Marriott, prompting a focus on direct bookings and perks, according to Deep Research Global.\n\nMixed market performance: International markets grew, while U.S. & Canada RevPAR lagged in some quarters, according to Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nAnother lawsuit: In November, Marriott was sued again in relation to land‑use, indigenous and cultural‑heritage disputes tied to hotel developments, reported TheStreet.",

    "description": "Diggs' lawyer said Tuesday that the receiver has reached an agreement on a financial settlement with the alleged victim",
    "fullText": "New England Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs has reportedly been charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery charges as the result of an alleged Dec. 2 incident, according to Boston 25 News.\n\nAccording to the police report, the alleged victim, who identified herself as Diggs' personal chef, claimed the incident occurred during a dispute over her pay. The victim alleged Diggs hit her and placed his hands around her neck, causing her to struggle to breathe and to feel lightheaded.\n\n“She said that she is normally paid by wire transfer, and the initial agreement was for weekly pay. She said that since she has been working, she has been getting paid monthly instead,” according to the police report. “As of now, she said that she still believes she is owed a month’s pay.”\n\n“You will be paying me out for the season & the money you said you would give me,” the victim, who told police she had worked for Diggs since July, wrote in a text to the Patriots receiver.\n\n\"I don’t gotta do a mf thing...You can get whoever you want,\" Diggs responded. \"You got my address, tell them come take the money.”\n\nAfter the alleged assault took place, the victim told police that she received messages from Diggs asking her to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nDiggs made a remote court appearance Tuesday morning with his attorney attempting to have the police report impounded. Attorney Michael DiStefano argued that the details of the charges should remain sealed. DiStefano also reportedly told the court that Diggs offered a financial settlement to resolve the issue with the alleged victim.\n\n“As we speak, they’re working to come to an agreement on that,” DiStefano said.\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs,\" read a statement from the team on Tuesday. \"Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nAnother attorney for Diggs, David Meier, sent a statement to ESPN that said the allegations were \"unsubstantiated.\"\n\n\" Stefon Diggs categorically denies these allegations,\" Meier said. \"They are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated, and were never investigated — because they did not occur. The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: they are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee's satisfaction. Stefon looks forward to establishing the truth in a court of law.\"\n\nThe NFL also released a statement that read, \"We are aware of the matter and have been in contact with the club. We have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nThere is a Jan. 23 scheduled arraignment for Diggs. Should the Patriots advance in the NFL playoffs, the AFC championship game is set for Sunday, Jan. 25.\n\nThe judge in the case will reportedly consider a request to extend the arraignment date to March.\n\nThe 32-year-old Diggs is in his 11th NFL season and first with the Patriots after signing a three-year, $69 million to join the team in March. Through 16 games this season he has 82 receptions for 970 yards and four touchdowns.",

    "description": "A veteran of the agency claims he’s faced workplace discrimination due to his sexual orientation.",
    "fullText": "A veteran Washington State Patrol trooper claims he’s faced discrimination and hostility in the agency due to his sexual orientation — issues that reportedly reached a breaking point when WSP personnel created and circulated a demeaning video of him generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nCollin Overend Pearson, who’s a Pierce County resident and gay, alleges that he’s been subjected to “repeated instances of discriminatory and unconstitutional conduct by WSP and its officers” during nearly two decades of employment, according to a lawsuit filed Dec. 19 in Pierce County Superior Court.\n\nThe conduct has damaged his reputation, the complaint said.\n\nIn a statement Monday, WSP spokesperson Chris Loftis declined to comment on the allegations, citing the agency’s policy and practice regarding pending litigation.\n\n“The Washington State Patrol believes that all employees have the right to work in an environment where skills, abilities, and dignity are valued and that is free from bias, harassment, and intimidation,” Loftis said.\n\nPearson is assigned to WSP’s District 1, which covers Pierce and Thurston counties, according to attorney Mark Conrad, who’s representing Pearson.\n\nPrior to suing the state, which allegedly failed to take appropriate actions to curb the discrimination and hostility, Pearson filed a legal claim against it late last year that served as a notice for it to put an end to the bad behavior, Conrad said in an interview Monday.\n\n“Instead of stopping, the conduct escalated,” Conrad said.\n\nIn December, WSP personnel created an AI-generated video that depicted Pearson and another uniformed, male trooper kissing on a roadside, the lawsuit claims. A voiceover in the video states, “this is SWAT training, no homo,” — using a derogatory phrase that insinuates “homosexuality is inferior or insulting,” according to the suit.\n\nConrad said the video was circulated among troopers and appears real, which is what he believes makes it so damaging beyond it being plainly derogatory and intended to humiliate his client. The deepfake also showed that at least some WSP personnel feel emboldened to engage in conduct demeaning to LGBTQ+ employees, he said.\n\nIt was the last straw for Pearson, according to Conrad, who said his client had put much thought into a “very difficult” decision to sue. The lawsuit accuses the state, by and through the WSP, of discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy, and it seeks unspecified damages to be proven at trial as well as legal fees.\n\nDespite the personal nature of the claims within the complaint, it was important to Pearson that he step forward, including by using his full name and not just his initials in the public filing, “to ensure that other people don’t have to face the environment that he’s currently facing,” Conrad said.\n\n“This can’t be tolerated in the workplace,” he said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites other alleged instances of discrimination, including when Pearson’s job offer in Des Moines was rescinded after a WSP captain advised the chief of that police department against hiring him, and when WSP detectives investigated an anonymous complaint that accused Pearson of threatening patrons while working off-duty at a Tacoma gay bar.\n\nPearson never worked at the bar, according to Conrad, and the suit said the complainant’s claim against Pearson was deemed to be unfounded. Conrad said he didn’t know the reason why the WSP captain had interfered in Pearson’s career move, nor did he know the status of an internal complaint that Pearson had filed in response.\n\nIn one instance, when Pearson inadvertently missed work, the WSP reacted more strongly than it did in similar situations involving other troopers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPearson had been out sick for two days in December 2023 and overslept for a shift after his phone died. He didn’t notify his supervisor that he would miss work. A trooper was dispatched to Pearson’s home, where a man who was staying with Pearson answered the door and Pearson was awoken and interrogated by the trooper, according to the suit. Later that day, WSP personnel sent Ruston Police Department officers to conduct an additional check at the home, the suit said.\n\nThe missed workday prompted a formal months-long WSP investigation that involved outside agencies and included interviews with Pearson’s colleagues and scrutiny of his personal life, according to the suit. Ultimately, it was recommended Pearson be suspended for five days without pay for violations of “neglect of duty” and “use of alcohol — off duty,” the suit said.\n\nDuring a hearing on the matter, Washington State Patrol Troopers Association president Spike Unruh objected to the latter violation, arguing that WSP had unlawfully entered Pearson’s home without his consent, according to the suit.\n\n“Unruh also presented evidence that numerous troopers had previously overslept and were not subjected to home entry or similar treatment, and that it was not standard practice to involve outside agencies or conduct multiple home visits when a trooper failed to show for one workday,” the suit said.\n\nThe WSP’s probe “had effectively ‘outed’ Plaintiff’s sexuality to the entire (Office of Professional Standards) section, further compounding the emotional toll of the situation,” the suit said.\n\nIn August 2024, the WSP acknowledged that the entry into Pearson’s home was illegal and that no information obtained during that entry could be used against him, according to the suit, which said that the agency reclassified the off-duty alcohol violation as “undetermined.”",

    "description": "Paradoxically, weak rewards build strong motivation.",
    "fullText": "Rewarding yourself can backfire. If you tell yourself, “I’ll only listen to my favorite podcast while I’m at the gym,” it takes just one moment of weakness to realize you can cheat and listen to it any time you want. Instead, try this: Reward yourself with something that has no enjoyment value whatsoever. Like a checkmark on your calendar.\n\nI first heard this tip from writer Tim Clare’s podcast. If you want to stay motivated, he says, the reward has to be so crappy that you’re not actually working for the reward. He said that he puts a checkmark on his calendar every day he writes, and at the end of the week enough checkmarks earn a gold star. The same approach has worked for me and for others. I have to admit: Buying myself a pack of stickers is embarrassingly motivating.\n\nTim Clare likes the theory that this works because of cognitive dissonance: We have to change something major (our behavior) to earn something that's not valuable (a sticker), so we try to resolve that dissonance by deciding we value the behavior change. The crappy extrinsic reward strengthens our sense that the new habit is intrinsically valuable.\n\nAnd as my colleague Meredith Dietz has written, experts believe that the secret to lasting motivation lies in our intrinsic goals. Engaging in healthy behaviors like exercise only works if we're doing those behaviors for their own sake, not because we're enduring our gym time as a means to an end. Extrinsic rewards like streaks and badges can gamify this process so addictively that we lose sight of why we're actually doing it in the first place. Note that I'm not saying you should chase streaks; I'm thinking more like literal stickers on a piece of paper, or a note in your phone where you write down how many miles you ran this week.\n\nAnother type of ineffective reward is the real-life splurge: promising you'll treat yourself to something (a dessert, a clothing purchase) once you hit a certain goal. Here's the problem: If you hate exercising so much that you need a bribe to do it at all, you're quickly going to find a way to have the reward without the work. There's nothing actually stopping you from listening to that \"gym only\" podcast at home, or ordering yourself the new outfit you had earmarked as a reward for when you make it through the couch to 5K program.\n\nUsing a crappy reward works because it just reflects your existing motivation back on itself. You check off today's work, not because the checkmark is valuable in itself, but because the checkmark reminds you that you kept a promise to yourself. There's a thrill to closing that loop, and those little wins really build your self-efficacy. In self-efficacy theory, small wins boost your motivation to keep working toward bigger goals.\n\nThe best part of using stickers or checkmarks is that it’s pointless to cheat. What are you going to do—lie to yourself when you didn’t actually go to the gym? But building up that row of numbers or stickers becomes its own reward. You’re really just rewarding yourself with the satisfaction of having stuck to your habit.",

    "title": "Seven Clever Ways to Use C-Clamps Around the House",
    "description": "If you have one of these classic metal clamps, you should know they’re way more useful than you think.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve been doing any kind of work around any kind of house for a while, you probably have a few trusty old-school C-Clamps on hand. The C-Clamp has been in use for thousands of years. It’s one of those dead-simple tools that just works. It’s also one of those tools you tend to collect multiple examples of, in different sizes.\n\nTypically, you use a C-Clamp to, uh, clamp stuff together, like two pieces of wood, or to clamp something into place while you work on it (I use them a lot to cut lumber so I can have both hands on the saw, as I am allergic to emergency rooms.) But the C-Clamp is actually a very versatile tool that can be deployed in a number of creative—but useful!—ways. Here are some of my favorite ways to repurpose those old C-Clamps.\n\nIf you need to carry something that’s bulky, heavy, and awkward, having some temporary handles always makes the job easier. If you have a few C-Clamps, you’re golden: Just clamp a couple onto whatever you’re transporting and you have instant handles to make the haul a little easier. They can also be used as handles for rolled-up materials, like rugs or mats—just thread the roll through a pair of C-Clamps, tighten them closed, and carry on.\n\nIt’s happened to all of us: You need to drive a nail somewhere, but there’s no room to swing a hammer, or for some reason you’re reluctant to make a lot of banging noise. The solution is your trusty C-Clamp: Just place the clamp over the nail head and tighten. The clamping action will inexorably (and silently) drive that nail into place. This isn’t an efficient way to drive a lot of nails, of course, but in a tight spot, it’s brilliant.\n\nNeed to tighten or loosen a connector, but you don’t have a wrench at hand? Tighten a C-Lamp around the bolt, cuff, or connection point so that it’s gripping tightly, then slowly turn it in the direction you need. Make sure the clamp is tight enough to prevent slippage, and you might want to use something (a handy piece of cloth works) to protect the connection from damage as you work.\n\nWhether it’s corralling all those extension and power cords on a workbench or work site, or organizing computer cables on your desk with an industrial vibe, C-Clamps can keep all those wires under control and out of your way in a pinch. Just gather the cords at the edge of the desk or table and clamp them down. This is a perfect temporary solution, as the cords can pass freely through the clamps without risk of damage, and the clamps can be removed when the job is done.\n\nNeed a couple of bookends to hold stuff in place on a shelf? A pair of C-Clamps attached to the outer edge and clamped in as deep as possible will work. This could even be a permanent design choice if your taste runs toward the rustic or industrial.\n\nC-Clamps are ideal devices when anchor points are needed, but you don’t want to attach anything permanent that would require fasteners and drilling into a structure. Need a clothesline to dry your laundry when the dryer breaks? Two C-Clamps and some rope or twine are all you need. Need to hang tools, clothes, or anything else? C-Clamps attached to a shelf of any kind, combined with a hook, will work a charm. Need to hold a tablecloth or other covering in place? Nothing clamps stuff down to a horizontal surface better than C-Clamps.\n\nWhether you’re spooling filament to your 3D-printer or feeding twine or wire to yourself as you work on a project, sliding the spool over a C-Clamp and then clamping it into place gives you a sturdy holder that you can pull from. This means you won’t have to juggle your spool every time you need more slack, and you can easily unclamp and reposition the spool if you’re on the move as you work.",

    "fullText": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The United States and Ivory Coast signed a health deal Tuesday requiring the U.S. to commit $480 million to the West African nation’s health sector as part of “America First” global health funding pacts that mirror the Trump administration’s foreign policy.\n\nThe signing in Ivory Coast’s capital of Abidjan covers areas such as HIV, malaria, maternal and child health, and global health security. It is the latest agreement the U.S. has entered with more than a dozen African countries, most of them hit by U.S. aid cuts, including Ivory Coast.\n\nU.S. aid cuts have crippled health systems across the developing world, including in Africa, where many countries relied on the funding for crucial programs, including those responding to outbreaks of disease.\n\nThe new health pact is based on the principle of shared responsibility with Ivory Coast committing to provide up to 163 billion CFA francs ($292 million) by 2030, representing 60% of the overall commitment, according to Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ivory Coast Jessica Davis Ba said the U.S. government is moving “beyond the traditional aid approach toward a model focused on trade, innovation, and shared prosperity.”\n\n“Today, our bilateral cooperation is entering a new phase. We are implementing the America First global health strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the new “America First” global health funding agreements are meant to increase self-sufficiency and eliminate what it says are ideology and waste from international assistance. The deals replace a patchwork of previous health agreements under the now-dismantled United States Agency for International Development.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, USAID had invested $115 million to support sectors such as health, education and aid for refugees mostly fleeing violence in neighboring Sahel states.\n\nAnalysts say the new approach to global health aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad.",

Is $2.5M Enough To Spend $100K A Year In Retirement, Or Will Taxes Make That Impossible?",
    "fullText": "A Reddit user is wondering if a $2.5 million nest egg can produce $100K in income.\n\nHe’s concerned about taxes but also needs to pay attention to his withdrawal rate.\n\nIf he wants to avoid worrying about taxes as a retiree, he can save in Roth accounts.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nWhen you are making plans for retirement spending, you need to take many costs into account -- including taxes. If you are hoping that $2.5 million will provide you with $100K, you should consider both whether that income is possible at a safe withdrawal rate and how your tax bill is going to affect the amount you have left over to spend.\n\nBefore you even consider the impact of taxes, you need to make a decision on a safe withdrawal rate.\n\nExperts traditionally recommended that you follow the 4% rule if you wanted the best chance of your money lasting for at least 30 years. Since that rule says you can withdraw 4% of your account balance in your first year of retirement and then make inflation-based adjustments, your $2.5 million could produce exactly $100,000.\n\nHowever, experts have now revised that downward to say you should limit withdrawals to 3.7%. There have also long been questions as to whether the 4% rule is conservative enough, especially as projections for future returns have gotten lower and projected future lifespans have gotten longer.\n\nIf you don't mind taking a greater chance of your money running short, you could still stick with the 4.00% rule and assume you'll be able to withdraw $100K from your $2.5 million account without problems. But, if you don't like the idea of cutting things so close, you may be better off aiming to save a little more to give you a cushion -- even before you consider the issue of how taxes will impact your ability to spend $100K.\n\nNow, you have another issue to deal with: Taxes. Let's say you do decide you're OK with taking $100K per year out of your accounts. The question becomes, how much of that money will you have to give to the IRS and to your state or local government? If you were hoping to have $100K after taxes to spend, will that be possible?\n\nThe answer to that is: It depends. If you have put all of your money into a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) account, then you don't have to worry about taxes as long as you follow the rules for tax-free withdrawals. If you take $100K out, you can spend it all.  If you want to take the simplest approach and not have to think about the impact of taxes on your investments, this is most likely the route you should go.",

    "fullText": "on December 30, 2025 at 12:00PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nNew Year’s Eve doesn’t have to be limited to champagne and confetti in the real world. Video games offer their own ways to celebrate, from dazzling fireworks to high-speed races and creative parties with friends. Sometimes, getting together virtually is the only way everyone can be together.\n\nIn Animal Crossing, you can ring in the new year with a sky full of fireworks over your island. Fortnite Creative lets you throw your own custom parties with friends, complete with music, games, and chaos. Mario Kart brings the celebration to the tracks, where fireworks light up the sky as you race across Rainbow Road as the clock towards the new year ticks down.\n\nNo matter your style, these games turn the countdown into an interactive, unforgettable experience that's perfect for friends and families who can't be together to ring in the new year.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the few games that fully commits to New Year’s Eve as an in-game event. On December 31, the plaza transforms with decorations, party favors, sparklers, and a real-time countdown that syncs with the player’s system clock. Isabelle and villagers gather in the square, music ramps up as midnight approaches, and fireworks cap off the celebration.\n\nBecause islands are persistent social spaces, players can invite friends over to experience the countdown together. Everyone can dress for the occasion, emote, exchange gifts, and wander the island after midnight. It feels less like a mini game and more like a shared holiday ritual, which is why it remains the gold standard for virtual New Year’s parties.\n\nWe have Mario Kart World listed here, but nearly any Mario Kart game will work. The series is known for gorgeous tracks that feature stunning visual effects, many of which are fireworks that would fit in on any New Year's Eve parade or celebration.\n\nHop online, hit up a few tracks, and if you're up for it--setup a race along one of those courses that feature fireworks just as the countdown triggers. We're talking Crown City or several iterations of Rainbow Road, among others.\n\nMario Kart World does offer custom lobbies that make it easy to connect with friends, but you can also tout Mario Kart out as part of any in-person New Year's Eve party too!\n\nWhile Epic Games has been known to feature fireworks in live battle royale lobbies near the end of the year, the real party kicks off in Fortnite Creative. Here you can find player-made game modes that let you play your own way--including custom trivia night mods, prop hunt, and party royale-like modes.\n\nOf course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with hopping from the battle bus together as the remaining hours in the year grow fewer and fewer. WinterFest takes place in Fortnite around the end of December each year, giving the island a snowy backdrop as you fight for your life.\n\nWarzone doesn't have the flexibility of something like Fortnite Creative, but its high-octane action makes for some scenes that feel like a New Year's Eve fireworks show. Blowing up helicopters out of the sky or sending trucks off the ground with explosives are little milestones on the way to battle royale victory.\n\nWarzone has become more popular than traditional Call of Duty--and for good reason. Battle royale brings the survival element of war that no other Call of Duty has before. Doing so, with friends, at the end of the year is a blast.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV excels at player-driven celebrations. Housing districts, Free Company estates, and public hubs often host New Year’s countdowns organized by the community. Players dress up, set off fireworks, and gather around stages while DJs stream music externally.\n\nThe game’s strength is how social it feels even without official events. Emotes, glamour, and roleplay-friendly systems allow players to turn the night into a true virtual party. It feels communal, intentional, and uniquely festive.\n\nGTA Online offers endless locations for hosting a New Year’s party, from penthouses and yachts to nightclubs and rooftops. Fireworks launchers, champagne animations, and curated music help sell the celebration without much effort.\n\nPrivate sessions make it easy to turn chaos into a controlled party environment. Friends can dress up, take screenshots, and roam Los Santos together at midnight, blending sandbox freedom with a party atmosphere.\n\nMinecraft is a blank canvas for New Year’s parties. Players can build stages, countdown clocks, and massive firework rigs, then invite friends to explore and celebrate together. Redstone allows for surprisingly elaborate countdown mechanics.\n\nBecause it is player-driven, each party feels personal. Whether it is a cozy survival world or a creative server spectacle, Minecraft lets groups define what celebration looks like.\n\nRoblox thrives on social experiences, many of which are designed specifically for events. Player-creators and professionals regularly create countdown rooms, concert spaces, and dance clubs perfect for New Year’s Eve gatherings.\n\nIts accessibility makes it easy to invite large groups, even casual players. Jumping between games keeps the party moving, while social hubs provide a place to gather at midnight.\n\nFall Guys feels like a party game by design, with colorful characters and short, high-energy rounds. Friends can queue together and treat matches as playful chaos while chatting through the countdown. The lack of downtime makes it ideal for New Year’s Eve. It keeps energy high without demanding focus, letting players celebrate and laugh together.\n\nSome minigames offer the perfect backdrop for a New Year's Eve gathering, including Short Circuit and Hex-A-Terrestrial, complete with a night sky and bright lights to get you in the festive mood.\n\nNo Man’s Sky offers a surprisingly calm party atmosphere. The Nexus serves as a shared social hub, while player-built bases can become private celebration spaces complete with fireworks and emotes. The game works well for laid-back New Year’s parties. Players can explore, take group photos, and ring in the new year against alien skies.\n\nSea of Thieves turns New Year’s Eve into a pirate celebration. Crews can sail together, play shanties, drink grog, and fire cannons into the sky at midnight. The trick shots people have been able to pull off by launching themselves out of cannons, across the sea, and onto other ships are nothing short of incredible. Drunken-madness induced incredible, though.\n\nSea of Thieves adventures are less about competition or loot and more about the shared memorable moments created. Even just sailing under the stars can make for a wonderful way to ring in the new year.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic leans into rowdy celebration through its Space Rig hub. Players can dance, drink at the bar, and trigger music before or after missions, making it a natural gathering spot. Honestly, the Overwatch-like mining adventure is a blast, but sometimes you don't even need to jump into the action to have a good time.\n\nA New Year’s party here feels communal and silly. It is perfect for smaller groups that want something social without leaving co-op gameplay behind.",

    "description": "Israel on Tuesday said it had suspended more than two dozen humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and CARE, from operating in the Gaza Strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.  Israel says the rules are aimed at preventing Hamas and other militant groups from infiltrating the aid organizations.",
    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Tuesday said it had suspended more than two dozen humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and CARE, from operating in the Gaza Strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.\n\nIsrael says the rules are aimed at preventing Hamas and other militant groups from infiltrating the aid organizations. But the organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm a civilian population desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nIsrael has claimed throughout the war that Hamas was siphoning off aid supplies, a charge the U.N. and aid groups have denied. The new rules, announced by Israel early this year, require aid organizations to register the names of their workers and provide details about funding and operations in order to continue working in Gaza.\n\nThe new regulations included ideological requirements — including disqualifying organizations that have called for boycotts against Israel, denied the Oct. 7 attack or expressed support for any of the international court cases against Israeli soldiers or leaders.\n\nIsrael’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs said more than 30 groups — about 15% of the organizations operating in Gaza — had failed to comply and that their operations would be suspended. It also said that Doctors Without Borders, one of the biggest and best-known groups in Gaza, had failed to respond to Israeli claims that some of its workers were affiliated with Hamas or Islamic Jihad.\n\n“The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome — the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not,” Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli said.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said Israel's decision would have a catastrophic impact on their work in Gaza, where they support around 20% of the hospital beds and a third of births. The organization also denied Israel's accusations about their staff.\n\n“MSF would never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity,” it said.\n\nWhile Israel claimed the decision would have limited impact on the ground. the affected organizations said the timing — less than three months into a fragile ceasefire — was devastating.\n\n“Despite the ceasefire, the needs in Gaza are enormous and yet we and dozens of other organizations are and will continue to be blocked from bringing in essential life-saving assistance,” said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which has also been suspended.\n\n“Not being able to send staff into Gaza means all of the workload falls on our exhausted local staff,” Low said.\n\nSome aid groups say they didn’t submit the list of Palestinian staff, as Israel demanded, for fear they’d be targeted by Israel, and because of data protection laws in Europe.\n\n“It comes from a legal and safety perspective. In Gaza, we saw hundreds of aid workers get killed,” Low explained.\n\nThe decision not to renew aid groups’ licenses means offices in Israel and East Jerusalem will close, and organizations won’t be able to send international staff or aid into Gaza.\n\nIsrael says militants exploiting aid groups\n\nAccording to the ministry, the decision means the aid groups will have their license revoked on Jan. 1, and if they are located in Israel, they will need to leave by March 1. They can appeal the decision.\n\nThe Israeli defense body that oversees humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said that the organizations on the list contribute less than 1% of the total aid going into the Gaza Strip, and that aid will continue to enter from more than 20 organizations that did receive permits to continue operating.\n\n“The registration process is intended to prevent the exploitation of aid by Hamas, which in the past operated under the cover of certain international aid organizations, knowingly or unknowingly,” COGAT said in a statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time Israel has tried to crack down on international humanitarian organizations. Throughout the war, Israel accused the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, of being infiltrated by Hamas, using its facilities and taking aid. The United Nations has denied it. UNRWA, the top U.N. agency working with Palestinians, has denied knowingly aiding armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants..\n\nAfter months of criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies, Israel banned UNRWA from operating on its territory in January. The U.S., formerly the largest donor to UNRWA, halted funding to the agency in early 2024.\n\nNGOs say Israel vague over data use\n\nIsrael failed to confirm that the data collected from the new regulations wouldn't be used for military or intelligence purposes, raising serious security concerns, said Athena Rayburn, the executive director of AIDA, an umbrella organization representing over 100 organizations that operate in the Palestinian territories. She noted that more than 500 aid workers have been killed in Gaza during the war.\n\n“Agreeing for a party to the conflict to vet our staff, especially under the conditions of occupation, is a violation of humanitarian principles, specifically neutrality and independence,” she said.\n\nRayburn said organizations expressed their concerns and offered alternatives to submitting staff lists, such as third-party vetting, but that Israel refused to engage in any dialogue.\n\nPalestinian girl killed in Gaza\n\nA 10-year-old girl was killed and another person was wounded by Israeli fire in Gaza City near the Yellow Line that delineates areas under Israeli control, the territory's Shifa Hospital said Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident but have said troops operating near the Yellow Line will target anyone who approaches or threatens soldiers.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, said on Monday that 71,266 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, not including the girl. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. The United Nations and independent experts consider the Health Ministry the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.",

    "fullText": "There are a variety of ways to invest in the chip boom.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is a leading global chip designer.\n\nASML plays an integral role in the advancement of chip technology.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nThe chip sector has performed exceptionally well in recent years, and that growth continues to be fueled by massive spending on AI infrastructure, which makes chips a fundamental commodity of the digital era. Chips are essential for everything from data centers and AI accelerators to electric vehicles, industrial equipment, and consumer electronics.\n\nCompanies leading in advanced chip manufacturing and AI-specific hardware design are securing wide moats against their competitors. While this sector can be volatile, strong demand provides a solid underlying tailwind and investors with the risk tolerance to put cash into this space could benefit from robust returns over the long run.\n\nOn that note, here are two fantastic chip stocks to buy and hold for at least the next decade.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is a semiconductor company that designs and develops computer processors and graphics technologies. AMD is a fabless semiconductor company, which means it designs its chips internally but outsources physical manufacturing to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nIts major product lines include central processing units (CPUs) under the Ryzen brand for consumer personal computers and the brand EPYC for enterprise servers, where it has consistently gained market share from key competitors including the likes of Intel. AMD sells graphics processing units (GPUs) under its Radeon line for gaming and professional visualization purposes.\n\nFor example, AMD provides custom hardware for major gaming consoles including the Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X/S. Its GPUs are also becoming increasingly important for data center growth.\n\nAMD expects its data center business to grow at a greater than 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years. Thanks to its 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, AMD is also now a leader in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs enable highly optimized hardware designs for specific AI algorithms and their reconfigurable hardware offers unique flexibility, low latency, and power efficiency.\n\nIn terms of AMD's financial growth, the company reported total revenue of about $26 billion in fiscal year 2024. Of that total, about $13 billion (49% of total revenue) was attributable its data center business. Those top line figures represented respective increases of 14% and 94% from the prior year. The company's full-year 2024 GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income was approximately $1.64 billion, a 92% increase from 2023.",

    "fullText": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) — At least 41 young men have died as a result of circumcision procedures as part of traditional initiation activities in South Africa in November and December, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nTraditional initiation is a rite of passage into manhood for young men that is practiced annually by various ethic groups in Africa, including parts of South Africa. Among them are the Xhosa, Ndebele, Sotho and Venda communities.\n\nTraditionally, young men are isolated at initiation schools where they are taught cultural values and responsibilities as they become adults. The circumcision part of the initiation results every year in the deaths of some initiates, forcing the government to intervene through legislation.\n\nThe laws force initiation schools to be registered with authorities, but this has not stopped the proliferation of illegal initiation schools where many of the deaths are reported.\n\nParents are expected to pay for their children to be accepted into the initiation school for the prescribed period, which for some is a financial motivation to start an unregistered initiation school.\n\nInitiation periods typically run during winter (June-July) and summer (November-December) school holidays.\n\nSouth Africa's Traditional Affairs Minister Velenkosini Hlabisa told local broadcasters Tuesday that 41 initiates died during this year's summer initiation. He blamed negligence on the part of both the initiation schools, including registered ones, and parents for not adhering to safety standards and medical advice.\n\nHlabisa said some of the unproven advice often given to the young men is to avoid drinking water in order to heal faster.\n\n“There is negligence in terms of meeting health standards in some of the initiation schools. If you take your child to an initiation school, you never make a follow-up, you do not monitor, you do not go there to see whether the child does drink water, you are placing your child at risk,” he said.\n\nEastern Cape province has been identified as a hot spot for the death of initiates, totaling 21 so far.\n\nHlabisa said 41 people have been arrested in relation to illegal initiation schools, including parents who had supplied wrong ages for their children to be admitted.\n\nOnly children who are 16 years and above may be admitted to initiation school with parental consent, according to South African law.\n\nTraditional initiation is widely practiced in African communities, with the return of the initiates often characterized by joyful, cultural celebrations.",

    "fullText": "(NEXSTAR) – Hospitals, nursing homes and other medical facilities are struggling to gain ground on a drug-resistant and deadly fungus that has infected at least 7,000 people in 2025, according to tracking by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCandida auris, a fungus that was first reported in the U.S. in 2016, has spread rapidly over the past several years. It can survive on surfaces for long periods of time before spreading to patients through catheters, breathing tubes or IVs.\n\nSome strains of the fungus are considered a superbug because they’re resistant to all types of antibiotics usually used to treat fungal infections. While healthy people may be able to fight off the infection on their own, the fungus can be deadly in the health care settings where it spreads, where people are often sick and vulnerable.\n\nFungus labeled ‘urgent threat’ by CDC is spreading rapidly, hospital study finds\n\n“If you get infected with this pathogen that’s resistant to any treatment, there’s no treatment we can give you to help combat it. You’re all on your own,” Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of South Carolina, told Nexstar.\n\nThe fungus’ drug resistance has made it especially hard to contain. More than half of states reported clinical cases of Candida auris in 2025, the CDC reported. With one week of data left in the year, the annual case count is approaching last year’s record-breaking figure of more than 7,500 cases.\n\nSee which states are reporting the most cases of Candida auris in the map below. Data was missing for two states: Alabama and Florida.\n\nSome scientists theorize climate change is contributing to the spread of Candida auris and pathogens like it.\n\nHistorically, fungi have had a hard time surviving at our bodies’ warm body temperature, microbiologist Arturo Casadevall, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, told the Associated Press. But as the climate warms, the fungi are adapting.\n\n“We have tremendous protection against environmental fungi because of our temperature. However, if the world is getting warmer and the fungi begin to adapt to higher temperatures as well, some … are going to reach what I call the temperature barrier,” where they’ll be able to survive in the human body, Casadevall said.\n\nCandida auris: Study reveals who is most vulnerable to deadly fungus infection\n\nIn the past, the CDC estimated that “based on information from a limited number of patients, 30–60% of people with C. auris infections have died. However, many of these people had other serious illnesses that also increased their risk of death.”\n\nA study published in July, which looked at patients with Candida auris primarily in Nevada and Florida, found more than half of patients required admission to the intensive care unit and more than one-third needed mechanical ventilation. More than half of patients, whose average age was between 60 and 64, also needed a blood transfusion.",
