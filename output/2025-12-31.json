    "description": "Will Smith, Miguel Rojas, Andy Pages, Luka Doncic and so many others delivered marquee moments that helped me endure a terrible 2025.",
    "fullText": "It was the last story I wrote before everything changed.\n\nIt was Jan. 5, 2025, and I was marveling at the Rams gumption in their short-handed loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\n“It was weird,” I wrote. “It was wild.”\n\nI was so witty. I was so wrong.\n\nTwo days later, I was fleeing for my life, steering my car down narrow Altadena streets with a fireball at my back and a nightmarish future sprawled across the smoke-filled streets ahead.\n\nThe year 2025 was more tumultuous than any silly football game and its accompanying overwrought metaphors. It was a year that knocked me flat, tearing me apart from so many things that once anchored me, setting me afloat in a sea of guilt and despair and ultimate uncertainty.\n\nToday, I have a home but no home. My days are filled with the beeps and growls of bulldozers. My nights are draped in the silence of emptiness. What was once one of the coolest secrets in Los Angeles has become a veritable ghost town, the vast empty spaces populated by howling coyotes and scrounging bears.\n\nA lot has changed in the 12 months since the Eaton Fire spared my house but destroyed my Altadena neighborhood. I say a daily prayer of thanks that I did not endure the horror of the 19 people who lost their lives and thousands more who lost their homes. I am beyond fortunate to live in what was left behind.\n\nBut virtually nothing was left behind. Venerable manicured homes have been replaced by weed-choked vacant lots. Familiar local businesses are now empty parking lots. There is the occasional sighting of new construction, but far more prevalent is “For Sale” signs that have seemingly been there for months.\n\nAfter living in the limbo of hotels and Airbnbs for two months while my home was remediated, I was blessed to return to four walls and running water, but beset with the guilt of having a front-row seat to the pain of so many who lost everything. I was spared, but nobody in Los Angeles was spared, and it wasn’t until halfway through the year that I noticed a consistent light from the strangest source.\n\nEvery night, I would watch the Dodgers. At least once every couple of weeks, I would attend a Sparks game with my daughter, MC. Soon, there would be Saturdays with one of our college football teams, then Sundays with the NFL then, the baseball playoffs, leading to the insane Game 7 and morphing into the annual Lakers winter drama.\n\nThe highs, the lows, the dramatics, the desperation, it was all there when nothing was there, it was the feeling that even with everything gone, you still belonged to something.\n\nFrom Dodgers exhilaration to Laker despair, from USC football frustration to UCLA women’s basketball greatness, sports has been the bright wallpaper on a year of Southland darkness.\n\nIt is sports that kept me grounded, kept me steady and somehow kept me believing.\n\nIn the worst year of my life, it was sports that saved me.\n\nThe path back to normalcy began two weeks after the Eaton fire, when I left my temporary hotel room to attend a press conference for the Dodgers’ latest Japanese import, Roki Sasaki.\n\n“Invincible,” I wrote about the team’s rebuilt roster, a word that was so comforting during such a time when everything in life felt tenuous.\n\nI came back to the hotel after the press conference, wrote my story then, like thousands of others in my situation, packed up and moved to another hotel.\n\nSoon thereafter I was awakened late one night with the news of the Lakers stunning acquisition of Luka Doncic. I wrote this column from a rental house while preparing to move to yet another new place. My clothes were in a plastic grocery bag. My house was still in shambles. In Doncic, as least, there was hope.\n\nSeveral days later I attended the Doncic press conference, asked a question, and Doncic asked me to repeat it. Turns out, it wasn’t a language barrier, it was a sound barrier. I was speaking too softly. It was then I noticed that the trauma from the fire had exacerbated my Parkinson’s Disease, which affected my voice, one of the many symptoms which later led me to acknowledging my condition in a difficult mid-summer column.\n\nGood news returned in early March when it was announced that the Dodgers had made Dave Roberts the richest manager in baseball, giving him a new four-year, $32.4 million contract. In a bit of dumb luck that hasn’t stopped me from bragging about it since, 10 years ago I was the first one to publicly push for Roberts’ hiring. In such unstable times in our city, Roberts had become the new Tommy Lasorda, and his presence became a needed jolt of smile.\n\nIn early April, I wrote a column I never thought I’d write — that Bronny James had been transformed from circus to contributor. I also wrote a column that I maybe wish I hadn’t written so soon, that JJ Redick was a Laker success.\n\nIn late May I sadly said goodbye to my second family when I wrote about the end of my 22-year run on ESPN’s popular “Around the Horn” game show. It wasn’t the first time in 2025 that a column brought me to tears, witness the video immediately after the fire. Agreed, I spent the year showing so much emotion for someone who had gotten so lucky. But I’m guessing I wasn’t alone.\n\nTwo weeks later I wrote about my new family, the group of boxers I have joined in my fight against Parkinson’s. That was the toughest column I have ever written, as I was acknowledging something I refused to admit for five years. But the fire had seemingly set the disease ablaze, and I could hide it no longer.\n\nThe year continued with columns about the soon-to-be-retiring Clayton Kershaw, the greatest Dodger pitcher with the greatest entrance song. Hearing “We Are Young” when he took the mound consistently gave me hope that, through the treacheries of a summer that marked the escalation of those insane ICE raids, we can continue to strive for rebirth.\n\nThat’s what sports consistently provided in 2025, the hope that from beneath the rubble, we could all fly again.\n\nI voiced this hope in a Rams preview column that predicted they would go to the Super Bowl. I later wrote a Rams column predicting they would actually win the Super Bowl. I stand by my stories.\n\nAll of which led to a series of Dodger playoff columns that hopefully reflected the building energy of a town enthralled. After their Game 7 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays, I was so spent that I hyperventilated for what felt like an hour.\n\n“In the end, they not only ran it back, they sprinted it back, they slugged it back, and then, finally, they literally Will-ed it back,” I wrote.\n\nIn hindsight those words could have been written not only about a team, but a city, fighting back, staying strong, the results of its struggle mirroring the Dodgers’ consecutive championships, punching through desperation, from struggle to strength.\n\nIn 2025, sports showed me that life can get better, life will be better, that if we hang in there long enough we can all hit that Miggy Ro homer, make that Andy Pages catch, stay forever young.\n\nAnd thus I offer a heartiest and hopeful welcome to 2026.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Citrus Bowl is here, and for the last time in 2025, Michigan Football is set to take the field. Here are 3 keys to victory for the Wolverines vs Texas:",
    "fullText": "Bowl season is here, and after a tumultuous month of December, the No. 18 Michigan Wolverines — with an interim head coach in place — are set to take on the No. 13 Texas Longhorns in the Citrus Bowl today in Orlando.\n\nBoth teams had hopes of making the College Football Playoff this season, but failed to get in after 9-3 regular seasons. As most of these non-CFP bowl games go, several players are opting out on both sides; Texas won’t have key players on both sides of the ball, and the Wolverines will be without guys like Derrick Moore, Jaishawn Barham and Giovanni El-Hadi.\n\nHere are the final three keys to victory for the 2025 season for the Wolverines.\n\nWhen Michigan’s offense is on the field against Texas’ defense, both teams will be led by interim coordinators. For the Wolverines, co-offensive coordinator and tight ends coach Steve Casula will be calling plays with Chip Lindsey off to Missouri, and inside linebackers coach and co-defensive coordinator Johnny Nansen will be calling plays defensively after Texas fired defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski earlier this month.\n\nWhile many key defensive starters are out for the Longhorns, All-American linebacker Colin Simmons, a projected first-round pick with 11 sacks, will be playing. Simmons can wreck an entire game plan, so Michigan will have to be cognizant of where he is at all times.\n\nCasula needs to include protections for Simmons in his game plan, as chipping him with tight ends Marlin Klein and others can help buy Bryce Underwood time in the pocket. Casula also needs to be aggressive against a depleted Texas defense — what exactly does he have to lose at this point? Putting together first downs by any means necessary is the priority, so I want to see him have a proper mix of run plays and pass plays.\n\nUnderwood showed flashes of his five-star talent this season, but was inconsistent overall. Needless to say, Lindsey and Moore didn’t take a lot of risks with him as a playmaker. To use a metaphor, Michigan has a Lamborghini, but it rarely took it out of the neighborhood.\n\nWith a new play caller, I want to see Underwood’s full potential in this game. Throw in a few long passes, use a few creative plays throwing to Jordan Marshall out of the backfield, let Underwood make decisions in the read-option, and maybe scheme up a few designed runs for the freshman phenom.\n\nUnderwood is a talented enough player to pull off this upset. Throw out the conservative game plan and let him lead you to the promised land.\n\nThe expectations were too high for Texas quarterback Arch Manning to start this season, and he struggled early in the season. But he really came into his own to close out the year.\n\nYahoo NFL analyst Nate Tice said Manning would be the No. 1 pick in the draft if he declared. Breaking down his season through the NFL lens, CBS Sports’ Mike Renner gave him a C+ when it came to decision-making. Here’s what Renner wrote:\n\n“There are still numerous issues with his decision-making evaluators will want to see cleaned up. The two biggest are turning down easy completions and pre-determining two- or three-man concepts.\n\n‘The first is not uncommon with mobile quarterbacks who like to hunt big plays, but you have to take profits when you can in the NFL. The second is probably the more worrisome. What makes it all the more head-scratching is that he’s awesome going 1-to-2-to-3 on full-field reads. Give him a binary choice on one side, and he’d too often miss a receiver streaking wide open.”\n\nManning struggled with interceptions earlier this fall, but he didn’t throw a pick in Texas’ last two games (wins against Arkansas and Texas A&M). Michigan is going to need Manning to turn over the ball once or twice to win this one, so I’d expect Wink Martindale to dial up some NFL blitzes to force Manning to make quick decisions. If he hunts the big plays that Renner referred to, Michigan may be able to swing momentum with a pick or two.\n\nWhat else does Michigan need to do to win this game? Let us know in the comments.",

Not that the bar was high, but this has felt like the best offensive line of his career.

    "fullText": "Another year is almost over and 2025 has been a strong year for many footballers.\n\nFrom emerging young talent to experienced older heads showing they've still very much got it, BBC Sport looks at some of the best players in the men's game over the course of the last 12 months.\n\nYou can vote for who you think has been the best footballer in 2025 at the bottom of the article.\n\nThe England captain has been in the form of his life this year, continuing to be prolific for Bayern Munich.\n\nThe former Spurs striker, 32, has scored an incredible 60 goals for club and country in 2025.\n\nAmazingly that is still some way off the record for the most goals in a calendar year, which is currently held by Lionel Messi. The Argentina forward scored 91 goals in 2012.\n\nLamine Yamal is only 18 but it feels like he has been on the scene for a while as he regularly makes the headlines for his standout performances.\n\nHe shone for Spain as they won Euro 2024 last year and has continued to rise in 2025.\n\nThe teenager has seven goals and eight assists after 14 La Liga games for Barcelona so far this season.\n\nIn the first half of this year, he scored 11 goals and provided 10 assists for club and country.\n\nOusmane Dembele made an incredible start to 2025 as he scored 15 goals in his first eight games of the year on his way to finishing the 2024-25 campaign with 35 goals in 53 games - by far and away his best goalscoring form in any season.\n\nThe 28-year-old's performances on the pitch saw him win his first Ballon d'Or and although the goals haven't quite flowed as well so far this term, it has nevertheless been a brilliant year for the France forward.\n\nIt takes a brave person not to captain Erling Haaland in their Fantasy Premier League team because the Manchester City striker, 25, has been simply sensational in front of goal this season.\n\nHe has scored 25 goals in just 24 appearances this season while he was in equally deadly form for Norway as he helped them qualify for a first World Cup since 1998 by scoring 16 goals in their eight qualifiers.\n\nThis has been a difficult season so far for Cole Palmer with injury limiting his game time but he was the standout player at this summer's Club World Cup and was a key player for Chelsea last season.\n\nHe helped the Blues secure a return to the Champions League for this season, provided two vital assists as Chelsea beat Real Betis in the Conference League final and then was named player of the tournament at the Club World Cup, outshining some of the biggest teams and players in world football.\n\nPalmer, 23, scored three goals and provided two assists, with no other player surpassing his five goal involvements.\n\nGiven they won the Treble, Paris St-Germain players were always going to dominate this list.\n\nGoals and assists often grab the headlines but 23-year-old Nuno Mendes has cemented himself as one of the best left-backs in the world right now after some superb displays at full-back for PSG.\n\nGoalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who joined Manchester City from PSG in the summer, was named Fifa's best men's goalkeeper for 2025 earlier this month.\n\nThe Italy international was recognised for an exceptional year in which he won the Champions League for the first time and three domestic trophies with PSG.\n\nThe 26-year-old has since established himself as a key member of Pep Guardiola's City, who currently sit second in the Premier League and fourth in the Champions League.\n\nPedri, 23, who arguably enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career in 2024-25 as he helped Barcelona win the domestic treble, is now regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world.\n\nHe had the most recoveries (254) among players in the top five European leagues last term and also showed he is one of the best chance creators in Europe as he created 70 chances for his Barcelona team-mates last season.\n\nWith injury issues seemingly behind him, he is continuing to play an important part for Barcelona this season and has helped them to sit top of La Liga, ahead of rivals Real Madrid.\n\nIt has been a prolific 2025 for Kylian Mbappe, who has scored 59 goals in all competitions for Real Madrid this year.\n\nThis means the 27-year-old striker has equalled the record number of goals scored in a calendar year which was set by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2013.\n\nGiven the unglamorous nature of the role, a defensive midfielder has to be very, very good to be considered the best player in the world, but Vitinha, 25, has certainly been very, very good in 2025.\n\nCompared to the legendary Andres Iniesta, Vitinha possesses brilliant technique and positioning which help him to dominate games from the middle of the park for Paris St-Germain.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Steve Nielsen on Alpine’s rebuild: I don’t believe “in a 100-race plan”",
    "description": "Once upon a time, Alpine put its faith in a 100-race project to reach the top of Formula 1, but that is no longer the case under the team’s current management",
    "fullText": "Alpine managing director Steve Nielsen downplayed the idea of long-term recovery timelines as the Enstone-based team looks to rebuild itself in Formula 1.\n\nThis marks a clear departure from the philosophy of Alpine’s previous management, which committed to a so-called 100-race plan designed to return the team to the front of the grid. That project began in 2021, when Renault rebranded its Formula 1 operation as Alpine, with the expectation that the team would be fighting for podiums by 2024 and victories in 2025.\n\nInstead, Alpine has just completed its most difficult season in Formula 1, finishing last in the constructors’ championship after halting development of the A525 in early June to focus fully on the 2026 regulations.\n\nNielsen, who joined the team in September, insists there is no fixed timeframe for Alpine’s return to competitiveness.\n\n“I’m not a person who believes in a 100-race plan or a three-year plan or a five-year plan,” Nielsen said in Abu Dhabi. “I believe you put the best people you can get in the right positions, you give a clear mission, get the army marching all in the same direction, and you work as hard as you can and do the best job you can.\n\n“You mill away at it, it’s a slow grinding process, and you hope, eventually, you do a better job than everybody else.\n\n“I can tell you we’re building a better car next year than we have this year. I can’t tell you whether that will line up first, 10th or 20th on the grid. I’m confident we’ve made a step, but the other nine teams are doing the same, so you don’t know how much progress they’ve made.\n\n“All I know is we’re improving our structure, we’re recruiting in the areas where we’re weak, and that grinding process starts now. You can’t turn these things around in a few months or even a year.”\n\nNielsen previously spent multiple stints at Enstone during the Benetton and Renault eras, including serving as sporting director during the title-winning seasons of 2005 and 2006. Drawing on that experience, he recalled how long it took the team to become a championship-winning operation and how difficult it is to apply that metric to Alpine now.\n\n“I was here when Renault bought Benetton the first time around,” Nielsen added. “It took three years to win a race and five years to win the championship, and that metric doesn’t necessarily apply today. It might be shorter, it might be longer – you just do the best you can.”\n\nAlpine ended the 2025 season last in the standings with 22 points, scoring points in only one of the final 11 grands prix. Nielsen says the priority for 2026 is to ensure the team is competitive on a far more consistent basis and can contend at the top of the midfield.\n\n“I want to be racing every week, ideally for points,” he said. “We’ve managed that on the odd weekend this year, but too often we’ve been a long way off at the back. That’s not where this team belongs, it’s not where Enstone traditionally is, and it’s not where we want to be. We need to be fighting at the top end of the midfield for points every weekend.”\n\nAlpine needs “patience, common sense and consistency”, says Steve Nielsen\n\nAlpine shocked by F1 rivals developing cars so late into 2025\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "These numbers tell the story: the Commanders were really bad in 2025.",
    "fullText": "To say it's been a disappointing season for the Washington Commanders would be a massive understatement. After going 12-5 and reaching the NFC Championship Game last season, the Commanders are 4-12 heading into Sunday's regular-season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThere are many reasons why the Commanders took a nosedive this season. You could blame injuries, which is true, but every NFL team has injuries. Some of the concerns around this team heading into the season proved true. When you go from 12 wins to four, you have multiple issues.\n\nNicki Jhabvala of The Athletic shared this staggering number:\n\nThe Commanders are the first team in nearly 10 years to improve by 8+ wins one season, then have 8+ losses the following season. The last team to have such an extreme 3-year stretch was the Panthers (2014-16). https://t.co/tKgijLwVCt\n\n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) December 30, 2025\n\nThat's quite the fall from grace, which is why so many Washington fans worry that the 2024 success was a fluke.\n\nIt's hard to win in the NFL. The 2024 season was no fluke. Much of last season's success came because of then-rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels. Daniels covered so many of the team's flaws last season, including a poor defense and a lack of offensive playmakers outside of Terry McLaurin. Daniels was a cheat code on third-and-long and fourth downs. Washington's fourth-down success was historic and unsustainable.\n\nA regression was to be expected. Not just for Daniels, but the entire team. The roster still had holes due to the previous regime's poor drafting. The team was old, with GM Adam Peters having to fill so many holes due to the aforementioned previous regime.\n\nThen we get to Daniels. He battled injuries all season. Fortunately, none are serious and will not threaten his offseason, but each proved frustrating for him and the team. Add in McLaurin's injury, which cost him half the season, and almost everything went wrong for the Commanders in 2025.\n\nWhat Daniels did as a quarterback is not a fluke. The truth is, injuries impacted his season, and he didn't have time to adjust to defenses adjusting to him. He needed reps.\n\nLet's look at some more numbers, which highlight not only how bad Washington's defense has been, but also how the offense wasn't able to carry the team in 2025.\n\nThe Commanders averaged 28.5 points per game last season. This season, Washington has only scored 30 or more points once. That occurred in Week 3 against the Raiders, who are currently the NFL's worst team. On the other side of the ball, Washington has allowed opponents to score 30 or more points six times. The Commanders have allowed 27 or more points 11 times.\n\nThe numbers don't lie. It's been a historically ugly year for the Washington Commanders.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Numbers show they were historically bad in 2025",

    "description": "Former Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger broke down the performance from Aaron Rodgers in a Week 17 loss to the Browns.",
    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Steelers signed Aaron Rodgers this past offseason, in part, because they were looking for a veteran presence at the quarterback position who understood the game of football intricately. Now, the 21-year NFL veteran has come under heat from Steelers fans for some of his decision-making in last week's 13-6 loss to the Browns.\n\nThis week on his Footbahlin podcast, legendary Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger took the time to break down the effort from his former rival and current Steelers gunslinger from a signal caller's perspective. In particular, Roethlisberger locked in on a couple of different plays – the first play being an incomplete pass on 4th & 1 late in the first half, where he targeted tight end Scotty Miller on a low-percentage throw in the back of the end zone while wideout Adam Thielen was open on a route across the middle of the field.\n\n\"Aaron [Rodgers] pre-determined that he had one-on-one and no safety help,\" Roethlisberger said. \"He took the shot. I don't hate it. I really didn't hate it. My thing was he didn't make a great throw, but looking back at the film, it was exactly what we thought and what the defense was trying...Adam was open on the quick slant. I think because when that happens, you have to make that decision quick.\"\n\nRoethlisberger also honed in on a play in the final stages of the game, as the Steelers had a chance to even the score and were facing 3rd & Goal. Rodgers would throw an awkward-looking incomplete pass to the back of the end zone that seemed as if it were aimed at an area with no one in it. But Roethlisberger pointed out that while watching the play again, Pat Freiermuth's route design raises the possibility of miscommunication between Rodgers and his receiving corps.\n\n\"It looks to me like he's throwing an out-breaking route to Pat Freiermuth...Pat ran up and hooked. Could he have drilled it on him? Maybe. But it looks like maybe it was a read route, a choice route,\" Roethlisberger said. \"It looked to me like they weren't on the same page. Again, this is all my speculation, everybody. I don't know if this is true.\"\n\nYou'll be hard-pressed to find someone who understands the position better than Roethlisberger, who battled against Rodgers as one of the premier quarterbacks of their era for well over a decade and became a two-time Super Bowl champion and six-time Pro Bowler over the course of his career. And while his analysis isn't an indictment or attack on Rodgers, it also points out potential areas that cause these issues, which could be improved. Steelers fans will be hoping Rodgers can make that happen as the Steelers enter into a Week 18 showdown with the Ravens, where the AFC North and a playoff spot will be on the line.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Steelers legend shares thoughts on Aaron Rodgers' Week 17 performance",

Despite rumors and speculation, it's doubtful they target a quarterback with Jaxson Dart, a 2025 first-round pick, under center.\n\nWith limited games remaining, Giants scouts have one final major opportunity to evaluate top prospects in live game settings.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of the players the Giants should key in on today.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker\n\nAlthough the Giants' offensive line improved in 2025, they still have some issues along the interior. Greg Van Roten is an impending free agent, and the team has an out in Jon Runyan Jr.'s contract should they decide to move on.\n\nWith that in mind, Gennings Dunker could intrigue them as a potential late-second-round pick.\n\nHere's what Bleacher Report had to say about Dunker:\n\nGennings Dunker is a rugged, powerful in-line blocker built with the right stuff, but will need to kick inside to guard to mitigate his middling movement skills. He has the traits to carve out a role and crack a lineup on his rookie deal in a run-first, play-action-heavy offense.\n\nDunker is a 6'5\", 315-pound offensive line prospect, who entered the Iowa program as a 3-star recruit in the 2021 class.\n\nDunker started 11 games in 2024 at right tackle, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors. He started 11 games at RT during the '23 season and one in '22 at right guard.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Texas tight end Jack Endries\n\nMichigan is a mess right now due to various off-field reasons, but that doesn't mean it will be devoid of prospect talent on Wednesday. The opt-outs on both sides will hurt, but there's still something to watch for.\n\nWhile the Giants don't necessarily need a tight end, they could look for some depth in the mid-rounds, and Jack Endries is an intriguing option.\n\nHere's what NFL Draft Buzz had to say about Endries:\n\nWhat separates Endries from typical move tight ends is his football instincts and technical refinement rather than raw athleticism. He finds soft spots in coverage with veteran-like instincts and has eliminated the concentration drops that plagued his freshman season, but his modest frame and average speed ceiling prevent him from becoming a true mismatch weapon against NFL athletes.\n\nEndries represents the modern evolution of the position where receiving ability often outweighs traditional tight end responsibilities, but his blocking limitations create roster construction challenges that could affect his draft stock. His consistent production and technical soundness suggest he'll find a role somewhere in the middle rounds, yet the inability to contribute meaningfully in run support may cap his upside as anything more than a situational contributor.\n\nMichigan RB Justice Haynes (may not play)\n\nGame notes: Michigan linebackers Derrick Moore and Jaishawn Barham, offensive lineman Gio El-Hadi, have opted out of this game. Meanwhile, Texas had 12 players enter the transfer portal, and several more opted out of this game. There are too many to list, so keep track here.\n\nPlayer spotlight: Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese\n\nThis is the big game of the day and one that will be heavily attended by NFL scouts. What makes it more notable for the Giants is that several top-end talents will fall right into their range (from No. 1 to No. 7) -- most of whom play positions of need. Moreover, several have already been mocked to the Giants.\n\nGiants Wire has covered safety Caleb Downs quite a bit, so we went with linebacker Arvell Reese in the player spotlight instead.\n\nHere's what Mel Kiper Jr. had to say about Reese:\n\nThis is a complete football player. Reese jumps off the Ohio State tape, playing the game like a veteran. I see natural instincts at the linebacker position that allow him to make plays most guys just can't make, and he has the burst to get home when turned loose as a pass rusher. Reese has been a big riser in this class.\n\nArizona State TE Chamon Metayer\n\nGame notes: Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson, cornerback Keith Abne, offensive lineman Max Iheanachor, and running back Raleek Brown won't play. Duke corner back Chandler Rivers, offensive lineman Brian Parker, and edge rusher Vincent Anthony will also sit out.\n\nGame notes: Utah offensive linemen Spencer Fano and Caleb Lomu, and edge rushers John Henry Daley and Logan Fano will not play in this game. Nebraska running back Emmett Johnson Jr. will also sit this one out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Prospects Giants should watch during New Year's Eve bowl games",

    "fullText": "You can't teach an old dog new tricks, and you apparently can't get Aaron Rodgers to trust his Pittsburgh Steelers wide receivers fast enough — at least that's what NBC's Mike Florio believes.\n\nOn Monday's episode of PFT Live, Florio and Chris Simms criticized Rodgers for placing his trust in veteransl who have clearly lost a step, over younger, more talented wideouts.\n\n“This weird thing with guys he trusts,\" Florio said about Rodgers. \"...Why can’t you trust guys faster? Why does it need to be somebody you spent years with? Why can’t you warm up to somebody? Are you that mistrusting of everyone that it's only people that have proven themselves to you, over time, through thick and thin, that you're not willing to take that leap with a stranger? It’s just weird to me that he clings to relationships with guys who’s skills aren’t what they used to be.”\n\nFlorio and Simms criticized Rodgers for targeting aging wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling three plays in a row to end the game, when he was matched up against All-Pro cornerback Denzel Ward.\n\nRodgers has shown year in and year out that he favors his own trusted wideouts over in-house pass catchers, but he'll have no choice but to break that habit as the Steelers head into a must-win Week 18 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens without DK Metcalf for the second-straight game.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, including Pittsburgh's Week 18 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers' Aaron Rodgers ripped by Florio for trust issues with WRs",

But Joao Castelo-Branco reports that the substitution was precautionary, and that the player had nothing more than a cramp.\n\nThe defender reportedly claimed he’s “fine”, so the expectation is that he’ll be back in action again this weekend.\n\nIn other injury news, Declan Rice missed Tuesday’s game after James McNicholas reported for The Athletic that the midfielder had sustained a knee injury.\n\nMcNicholas claimed Rice was initially hopeful of facing Villa, but he didn’t quite make it back in time. The expectation ahead of the game was that it would be a short-term absence.\n\nYet Mikel Arteta said afterwards that the “swelling has to come right down” if Rice is going to be available to face Bournemouth on Saturday, so it’s evidently not a sure thing.\n\nRiccardo Calafiori also remains a doubt after missing the last couple of games with an “awkward” injury, whilst Cristhian Mosquera and Max Dowman continue to be absent as well.",

    "fullText": "Roma midfielder Bryan Cristante spoke to Sky Sport ahead of the Giallorossi’s match against Atalanta.\n\nAs 2025 draws to a close, Serie A teams are already preparing for the start of 2026, which for Roma will kick off with an away match against Atalanta in Bergamo.\n\nIt will be Gian Piero Gasperini’s game, but also Bryan Cristante’s, who exploded with the Nerazzurri under Gasperini: “Only good memories,” the midfielder told Sky Sport. “I was coming off two less-than-positive experiences, but at Bergamo was a boom, we achieved excellent results. Coach Gasperini had the intuition to let me play as a forward. He gives his all to get everyone to perform.”\n\nRegarding Gasperini, he added: “I found the same coach, always fired up, with great knowledge of the game. Obviously, he continued to do very well in Bergamo, and he brought the same energy here to Rome.”\n\nAnd on today’s Atalanta: “The team is the same. Obviously, when you change coaches after so many years, you need to get into gear. I think they’re growing, they’re getting back to playing at the level Atalanta should be at. We’ll need a great performance.”\n\nThe midfielder then spoke about the year it’s been for Roma: “Head-to-head matches? We lacked detail a bit. We played great games, controlling the game for long stretches. We lacked a goal, but we’re working on it. Roma’s 2025? It means we’re on the right track. It doesn’t matter much because they’re two different leagues, but it gives us confidence. We need to continue like this in the next half of the season.”\n\nHe then spoke about the future: “Me as a coach? I’ll play for a while longer (laughs). I’m not thinking about it now. Then we’ll see what happens.”\n\nAnd speaking of coaches: “We were pleased to see De Rossi go to the Curva. He means a lot to Roma. It was a great advert for football.”",

    "fullText": "Lazio have reportedly added a new name to their left-back shortlist, as they’re now considering making a move for Villarreal’s Alfonso Pedraza.\n\nThe Biancocelesti could part ways with Nuno Tavares in January. The former Arsenal man has been dropped to the bench after failing to impress Maurizio Sarri, with Luca Pellegrini now considered the manager’s first choice on the left flank. The 25-year-old Portuguese player has an offer from Al-Ittihad, and it remains to be seen if the parties will be able to reach a final agreement.\n\nIn the meantime, Lazio are reflecting on their options in the market, as they’ll be expected to recruit a direct replacement if Tavares ends up leaving Rome. According to Italian journalist Alfredo Pedullà, the Aquile are ‘very interested’ in Pedraza, who is currently running on an expiring contract.\n\nAlfonso Pedraza (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nAside from a few loan spells at the likes of Leeds United and Real Betis, the 29-year-old has been at Villarreal since the very start of his career. However, he is apparently destined for a new experience. The Yellow Submarines would like to keep their stalwart until the end of the season, but Lazio could try to work out a January cut-price deal.\n\nThe Villarreal youth product is considered a complete full-back, capable of offering contributions at both ends of the pitch, making him the sort of profile that Sarri appreciates. Nevertheless, as Pedullà explains, Aaron Martin remains high on Lazio’s shortlist, even though he’s considered a more attacking profile compared to Pedraza.\n\nLike his fellow Spaniard, Martin’s contract only runs until June, but the Grifone haven’t given up on finding an accord on a renewal. The 28-year-old is an Espanyol youth product who has been plying his trade at the Luigi Ferraris since 2023.",

    "fullText": "Die sieben Mitglieder der Landesregierung – plus der Bundeskanzler – nett lächelnd im Salon de la Présidence, gleich neben dem Sitzungszimmer des Bundesrats. So zeigt sich die Regierung auf ihrem offiziellen Foto 2026.\n\nDoch vier weitere Menschen sind noch im Bild: nämlich die Fotografinnen und Fotografen des Porträts. Ganz im Zeichen des Bildungsauftrags des Bildungsministers und Bundespräsidenten 2026, Guy Parmelin, haben das Porträt nämlich vier Studierende des Fotografie-Lehrgangs der Berufsfachschule in Vevey realisiert.\n\nDas Bild sei «ein authentisches Portrait des Bundesrats als Kollegium», schreibt die Bundeskanzlei in ihrer Mitteilung zum Foto. Die Regierung soll offensichtlich Harmonie und Einigkeit versprühen – Geschichten wie Kämpfe um die EU-Verträge, Zolldeals und Zolldesaster und viele andere Reibereien des Tagesgeschäfts finden im Bild keinen Widerhall – Ja, der für das EU-Dossier verantwortliche Aussenminister Ignazio Cassis (FDP) sitzt sogar an der Armlehne von SVP-Magistrat Guy Parmelin. Und auch die Bundespräsidentin 2025, Karin Keller-Sutter, steht nahe an Parmelin – keine Spur von Groll über ihrer Zollniederlage im Sommer.\n\nDas vorletzte Bundesratsfoto, bei dem alle Regierungsmitglieder gemeinsam und gleichzeitig fotografiert wurden, entstand für das Jahr 2023 unter der Leitung von Alain Berset (SP). Er versammelte seine Kolleginnen und Kollegen im Bernerhof und zeigte auf dem Foto eine leidenschaftlich diskutierende Regierung. Wobei einige Kommentatorinnen und Kommentatoren aber weniger Leidenschaft sahen, als handfesten Streit. Ein starker Kontrast zum Foto 2026, das wohl Einigkeit und Frieden untereinander ausstrahlen soll.\n\nWas denkst du über das neue Bundesratsfoto 2026 und seine Botschaft der «authentischen» Einigkeit?\n\nGuy Parmelin ist zum zweiten Mal Bundespräsident. Der Waadtländer präsidierte das Gremium bereits 2021, also mitten in der Corona-Zeit. Bei seinem damaligen Porträt musste die Regierung noch virtuell zusammenrücken. Wegen der geltenden Abstandsregeln wurden die Ratsmitglieder einzeln fotografiert und dann per Photoshop zusammengerückt.\n\nBeim neuen Foto ist das nicht der Fall: «Die sieben Bundesratsmitglieder und der Bundeskanzler wurden nicht einzeln, sondern bei einem gemeinsamen Shooting fotografiert», betont die Bundeskanzlei in der Mitteilung. Doch ganz ohne Photoshop ging es dann doch nicht: Die vier Lernenden, die sich im Hintergrund der Regierungsmitglieder im Bild verewigen durften, haben sich separat fotografiert und dann das Bild zusammengesetzt.\n\nEinem Trend kann sich aber offensichtlich auch die Landesregierung nicht entziehen: Medien werden immer öfter digital konsumiert. So ist das erste Porträt unter Parmelins Leitung noch 50'000 Mal gedruckt worden, das letztjährige von Karin Keller-Sutter noch 45'000 Mal und das Foto 2026 nur noch 35'000 Mal.\n\nWird es das Foto also bald nur noch digital geben? Nein, sagt die Bundeskanzlei auf Anfrage von 20 Minuten. Sondern: «Die Auflage des Bundesratsfotos entspricht jeweils der Nachfrage im Vorjahr». Die Bilder würden von Sammlerinnen und Sammlern bestellt und von den Departementen und Bundesämtern verteilt. «Es ist nicht geplant, den Druck einzustellen.»\n\nStefan Lanz arbeitet seit 2021 für 20 Minuten. Er ist Bundeshausjournalist mit langjähriger Erfahrung.",

    "fullText": "I am often devising agentic processes that I use regularly in Claude Code. Something that I have come up against when working with LLMs is that they frequently ignore (or forget) your CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md instructions.\n\nA useful pattern that I have been using to keep Claude on task is to give your process a name. I think this works because giving the agent a named process is like getting it to call a function. The agent is doing a dance, and that dance is the Samba. There is no ambiguity. The auto-complete engine of the LLM more reliably sticks to the moves of the dance.\n\nHere are two examples that have worked well for me.\n\nIt doesn’t escape me that Claude Skills is another way to do this. Skills are very similar in that they give processes a name, and I am using Skills in my own named processes as you will see below.\n\nIn fact, I think if your named processes are getting quite long, you may want to turn them into Skills.\n\nOften I don’t like to let an AI do all the work. For example:\n\nFor this process, I lean heavily on Obra’s Superpowers. I tell everyone using Claude Code to try it out!\n\n💡 Superpowers is a software development workflow for agents. It helps you deliver higher quality vibe engineering. One of the most mind-bending skills is the brainstorming skill, which uses the Socratic method to question your assumptions and tease out problems and solutions.\n\nOne of its skills is Test Driven Development (or TDD) which I have used extensively. It employs Red-Green-Refactor. You write failing tests first that expect the functionality you want to implement. However, if I want to take the wheel, I use what I coined “Test-Driven Pair Programming”. The only change that I made with TDPP is the following instruction inside my user level CLAUDE.md file:\n\nWhen asked to do test-driven pair programming (or TDPP), use the test driven development skill. You will handle the RED phase. The user will handle the GREEN-REFACTOR phases. Stop after every RED phase for the user to implement the GREEN phase. Use the code review skill when the GREEN or REFACTOR phases are completed by the user.\n\nNow every time I ask Claude to do TDPP, it will follow the process outlined above.\n\n💡 Beads is a CLI-based issue tracking system that stores its metadata in version control.\n\nRecently I received the following email:\n\nI was combing through beads issues on github and noticed you appear to use both superpowers and beads skills. What have you found as a successful workflow for using both in harmony. Are there specific modifications you have used to the AGENTS.md that have worked well with instructing the agent to use beads after using a superpower?\n\nA useful pattern that I have discovered to keep Claude on track is to give your process a name. Put something like the following in your CLAUDE.md:\n\nIMPORTANT: When asked to use BSP (beads superpowers), use the brainstorming skill with the designs stored using beads.\n\nYMMV, but I have found this to be a fairly effective way to get the agent to use a combination of skills and tools together.\n\nI never heard back, so I’m not sure how my advice worked out for them. However, I have had great success with this approach.\n\nI am sure there are others who have devised their own agentic processes. I would love to hear about them.\n\nWhat has worked for you? If you try my approach, I’d love to hear your feedback. Let me know in the comments or via email.",

    "fullText": "A lithopedion (also spelled lithopaedion or lithopædion; from Ancient Greek: λίθος \"stone\" and Ancient Greek: παιδίον \"small child, infant\"), or stone baby, is a rare phenomenon which occurs most commonly when a fetus dies during an abdominal pregnancy,[1] is too large to be reabsorbed by the body, and calcifies on the outside as part of a foreign body reaction, shielding the host's body from the dead tissue of the fetus and preventing septic infection.\n\nLithopedia may occur from 14 weeks gestation to full term. It is not unusual for a stone baby to remain undiagnosed for decades and to be found well after natural menopause; diagnosis often happens when the patient is examined for other conditions that require being subjected to an X-ray study. A review of 128 cases by T.S.P. Tien found that the mean age at diagnosis of women with lithopedia was 55 years, with the oldest being 100 years old. The lithopedion was carried for an average of 22 years, and in several cases, the women became pregnant a second time and gave birth to children without incident. Nine of the reviewed cases had carried lithopedia for over 50 years before diagnosis.[2]\n\nAccording to one report, there are only 300 known cases of lithopedia[3] recorded over 400 years of medical literature. While the chance of abdominal pregnancy is one in 11,000 pregnancies, only between 1.5 and 1.8 percent of these abdominal pregnancies may develop into lithopedia.[4]\n\nLithopedion was first described in a treatise by the Spanish Muslim physician Abū al-Qāsim (Abulcasis) in the 10th century.[5] By the mid-18th century, a number of cases had been documented in humans, sheep and hares in France and Germany. In a speech before the French Académie Royale des Sciences in 1748, surgeon Sauveur François Morand used lithopedia both as evidence of the common nature of fetal development in viviparous and oviparous animals, and as an argument in favor of caesarean section.[6]\n\nIn 1880, German physician Friedrich Küchenmeister reviewed 47 cases of lithopedia from the medical literature and distinguished three subgroups: Lithokelyphos (\"Stone Sheath\"), where calcification occurs on the placental membrane and not the fetus; Lithotecnon (\"Stone Child\") or \"true\" lithopedion, where the fetus itself is calcified after entering the abdominal cavity, following the rupture of the placental and ovarian membranes; and Lithokelyphopedion (\"Stone Sheath [and] Child\"), where both fetus and sac are calcified. Lithopedia can originate both as tubal and ovarian pregnancies, although tubal pregnancy cases are more common.[2]",

    "description": "Julius Edgar Lilienfeld (1925)",
    "fullText": "In 1934, German engineer Oskar Heil patented another FET variant.[HEIL] \r\nTwo decades after Lilienfeld, researchers at Bell Labs not only experimentally confirmed the field-effect described in Lilienfeld's patents[ARN98]—see the priority dispute Lilienfeld vs Bell Labs below—but also patented a point-contact transistor (PCT, patent filed on 26 February 1948 by William Shockley & John Bardeen & Walter Brattain).[BRA48] A few months later, the transistron (a junction field-effect transistor or JFET) was patented by German physicists Herbert F. Mataré and Heinrich Welker in France at Compagnie des Freins et Signaux Westinghouse (patent filed on 13 August 1948).[MAT48]\n\nAccording to legal files (1948) examined by American physicist Robert G. Arns,[ARN98] William Shockley & Gerald Pearson at Bell Labs had confirmed the field-effect described in Lilienfeld's patents. Unfortunately, \"published scientific, technical, and historical papers by these Bell scientists never mention either Lilienfeld’s or Heil’s prior work,\"[ARN98] \n\"not even a 1948 paper[SHO48] in which Shockley & Pearson demonstrated the field-effect experimentally.\"[ARN98]\n\nIn November 1948, various patent applications by Bell Labs were rejected for being too similar to Lilienfeld's (and Heil's) much earlier designs.[PAT48] (16 years later, in 1964, J. B. Johnson of Bell Labs claimed that some of Lilienfeld's FETs didn't work when he tested them, however, Arns points out[ARN98] that this statement \"appears to have been deliberately misleading.\") Later, some people claimed that Lilienfeld did not implement his ideas since \"high-purity materials needed to make such devices work were decades away from being ready,\"[CHLI]\n but the 1991 thesis by Bret Crawford offered evidence that \"these claims are incorrect.\"[CRA91] Lilienfeld was an accomplished experimenter, and in 1995, Joel Ross[ROS95] \"replicated the prescriptions of the same Lilienfeld patent. He was able to produce devices that remained stable for months.\"[ARN98] Also, in 1981, semiconductor physicist H. E. Stockman confirmed that \"Lilienfeld demonstrated his remarkable tubeless radio receiver on many occasions\".[EMM13]\n\nBefore the above issues became widely known, three Bell Labs researchers shared the Nobel Prize for the transistor, which should have been awarded to Lilienfeld. This was a major malfunction in the Nobel Prize selection process—and not the last one.[NOB] Bardeen, one of the 3 awardees, finally admitted in 1988 that Lilienfeld \"had the basic concept of\rcontrolling the flow of current in a semiconductor to\rmake an amplifying device,\"[BAR88][ARN98] and that his own point-contact transistor\r\"may have slowed the advancement of the transistor field because it diverted the semiconductor program from junction and field-effect transistors which subsequently proved to be far more useful commercially.\"[ARN98]\n\nSince the invention of the transistor, computers have become much faster through integrated circuits (ICs) gathering many transistors on the same microchip.\n\nIn 1949, German engineer Werner Jacobi at Siemens filed the first patent for an IC semiconductor \r\nwith several transistors on a common substrate (granted in 1952).[IC49-14]\n\nIn 1958, American engineer Jack Kilby demonstrated an IC with external wires.\r\nIn 1959, Robert Noyce presented a monolithic IC.[IC14]\n\nIn 1941, the world's first general-purpose program-controlled computer (Konrad Zuse's Z3)[ZU36][RO98][ZUS21] could perform roughly one elementary operation (e.g., an addition) per second. Since then, \r\nevery 5 years, compute has gotten roughly 10 times cheaper (note that his law is much older than \r\nMoore's Law which states that the number of transistors[LIL1-4] \r\nper chip doubles every 18 months). As of 2025, one human life after Z3, \r\nmodern computers can execute about 100 million billion instructions per second for the same \r\n(inflation-adjusted) price. \r\nThe naive extrapolation of this exponential trend predicts that\r\nthe 21st century will see cheap computers with a thousand times the \r\nraw computational power of all human brains combined.[RAW]\n\nWhere are the physical limits?\r\nAccording to Bremermann (1982),[BRE]\r\na computer of 1 kg of mass and 1 liter of volume can execute at most \r\n1051 operations per second on at most 1032 bits.\r\nThe trend above will hit\r\nthe Bremermann limit roughly 25 decades after Z3,\r\ncirca 2200. However, since there are only 2 x 1030 kg of mass in the solar system,\r\nthe trend is bound to break within a few centuries,\r\nsince the speed of light will greatly limit the acquisition \r\nof additional mass, e.g., in form of other solar systems, \r\nthrough a function ploynomial in time,\r\nas previously noted back in 2004.[OOPS2][ZUS21][DLH]\n\n1 Lilienfeld's citizenships. In 1882, Julius E. Lilienfeld was born in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in the partially German-speaking city of Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine). He was a professor in Leipzig (Germany) from 1905-1926. After World War I, Lemberg fell to Poland, and Lilienfeld became legally Polish (while staying in Leipzig). In 1934, years after his transistor patents filed 1925-1928,[LIL1-3] he also acquired US citizenship.\n\nFurther reading: Sec. 18 of the Annotated History of Modern AI and Deep Learning.[DLH]\n\rAcknowledgments\n\nSome of the material above was taken from previous AI Blog posts.[ZUS21][DLH]\r\nThanks to expert reviewers for useful comments.

    "fullText": "Bitwise ETFs: Bitwise Asset Management has announced an aggressive expansion into Exchange Traded Funds by registering 11 (eleven) new ETF registrations for various alternative digital currencies including AAVE, UNI, and TAO.\n\nBitwise Asset Management has taken the next step forward by creating a large new suite of hybrid strategy funds with investments in unique and innovative ways to invest in multiple alternative digital currencies.\n\nFor example, under the proposed name of “Bitwise AAVE Strategy ETF,” Bitwise will create a series of ETF funds with each ETF focused on a single digital currency but strategically structured as a hybrid strategy fund to create greater flexibility for investors.\n\nThe fund structure will allow the Investor to hold (up to) 60% of their total investment amount directly in the underlying digital token with the other 40% of the fund representing long-term investment products (ETPs) or financials (future contracts) combined with the same digital token the Investor is investing in.\n\nRead also: Grayscale Files for Landmark U.S. Bittensor ETP (GTAO) with SEC\n\nThis huge filing shows that Bitwise has made a strategic investment to create a full suite of ETFs for an investor looking for regulated investment opportunities, which go beyond Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nThese Bitwise ETFs would allow investors to focus on four prominent areas of crypto investment:\n\nThe filing builds on Bitwise’s strong performance so far in the ETF space in the form of their successful launches of Solana, XRP and Dogecoin ETFs within a short time frame, and strongly positions the firm at the forefront of providing investment vehicles for institutional users across the wide spectrum of the crypto asset ecosystem.\n\nRead also: Coinbase 2026 Outlook: Crypto’s Future Hinges on Derivatives, Prediction Markets, and Stablecoins\n\nWith these ETFs, Bitwise will put the next step of developing institutional crypto investment products into practice.\n\nThe hybrid structure will allow Bitwise to navigate the difficulties of operating in a regulated environment, create an efficient way to invest, and increase the number of single asset cryptos available to traditional brokerage accounts, thereby creating a closer link between the digital currency ecosystem and the traditional investment portfolio.\n\nIt refers to a hybrid structure where the fund can invest both directly in crypto and indirectly through other financial instruments. In this case, and for these Bitwise ETFs, this means up to 60% in the actual token (like AAVE) and the rest in other ETPs or derivatives that track that token’s price.\n\nThe 11 filings target: Aave (AAVE), Canton (CC), Ethena (ENA), Hyperliquid (HYPE), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Starknet (STRK), Sui (SUI), Bittensor (TAO), Tron (TRX), Uniswap (UNI), and Zcash (ZEC).\n\nThere is no set date. The filings are the first step in a process that requires SEC review and approval, which can take several months and is not guaranteed. The funds would list on NYSE Arca if approved.\n\nRead also: Mirae Asset Group Pursues Major Crypto Foray with $100 Million Korbit Acquisition",

    "fullText": "(Just been talking with somebody about getting a team better at customer interviewing — which reminded me of a thread on the hellsite I wrote after John Cutler asked for something similar. So reproducing and lightly expanding here for easier reference, and because I’m allowed to have shitty incomplete first drafts of stuff here :-)\n\nGet together on the shared text editor. Come up with an overarching research question. Hopefully pinned to your actual company strategy/active discovery work.\n\n(I should write a lot here about ways you can figure out decent research questions. But I’m currently on my Christmas break and I don’t want to, because it would turn this into a much, much longer article. The short version: If you end up with something like “Do they want to use feature X?” you’re doing it wrong. The long version: go read Indi Young’s or Steve Portigal’s books.)\n\nThen, as a group, write every dumb question you can think of around that pokes at that research question.\n\nThen, as a group, group related questions together. Maybe switch over to Miro/Mural — but sticking with google docs can work as well.\n\nStart asking “What higher level questions would evoke a story around that group of questions?”.\n\nThis often works it way up to questions like “Tell me about the last time you did X?” or “Tell me about your typical day doing Y?”\n\n(Don’t throw the more specific questions away — having a hierarchy of questions from general to concrete can be super useful if you want to probe around specific areas. But the more general story-based questions are going to end up being your workhorses.)\n\nOur preparation gives us research question, topics of interest, and a hierarchy of possible questions around those topics.\n\nTime to talk to a customer… NOT!\n\nTime in fact to rehearse. Rotate around the group. One interviewer. One interviewee. Everybody else observers.\n\nPractice introductions, getting consent signed off (consent, in this as in everything, is important), making the video recording work, etc.\n\nLead off with the high level questions. Listen for the topics coming up — maybe assign different observers to different topics. Experiment. Let the interviewer follow up with open questions, reflecting what the interviewer said, etc.\n\n(“Can you tell me more about X?” — where X is something they said earlier — is a super question to help dive deeper, or redirect the conversation that’s gone off track.)\n\nYou mostly won’t need the low-level questions — but if a topic area doesn’t get mentioned you can probe with more specific questions.\n\nAfter each mock interview reflect. What did we see/hear? What better questions could we have asked? Knock off the rough edges.\n\nFor zoom get all the observers to switch off their cameras, then you can set the display to hide non-viewers which can help the interviewer/interviewee focus.\n\nWhen you stop finding ways to improve your observation practice / questions — time to find some actual live participants. But do proper consent forms and do a verbal ask on recording as well to double check. Go talk to your ResearchOps or User Research folk for this if you have them.\n\nBlock out a day into blocks of interviewing time + decompression/discussion time. 30/15m or 60/30m feel about right. Remember time for lunch. Setup calendly to book out the slots. Fill ’em. If you get a no-show use it as another practice round.\n\n(and if I wasn’t feeling lazy I’d fill out some bits on decent note taking advice and analysis/synthesis type stuff here — so go read some Books to Get Your Customer Interviewing Practice Up and Running instead.)\n\nThe other sneaky thing you’ll notice when you do this as a group activity is that… it’s often better than the results you get when you do it solo.\n\nYou have multiple brains in the room poking at refining the research question. More people finding good questions to evoke stories from customers. More ears to hear and interpret what the customer has to say.\n\nTL;DR: Building the muscles for doing customer interviewing can be a fun group exercise.",

    "fullText": "My husband and I met on a dating app in 2021. He had moved to the US in 2009 and was in Mumbai, where I lived, to visit family.\n\nHis trip marked the start of our whirlwind intercontinental romance. In April 2022, after nearly a year of long-distance dating between the US and India, we got married in Mumbai, where I had spent all 36 years of my life. Nearly six months after the wedding, I moved from high-octane Mumbai to Sunnyvale, a sleepy suburb in San Francisco's Bay Area, leaving my job as the managing editor of an online business publication and bidding my friends and family goodbye. At the time, my husband worked in tech on an H-1B employment visa, which meant I could move to the US on an H-4 dependent spouse visa.\n\nWhen I got to the US, the heady joy of marital bliss was soon eclipsed by a crisis of identity. While I was glad to have found the man of my dreams à la Bollywood, I felt bitter about being a \"trailing spouse,\" moving to a new country for love, at the cost of professional stability. The busy editor who led a team of reporters in Mumbai quickly became an alter ego from a past life. Plus, I was incredibly lonely. It was only after roughly three years in the States that I began to think of Sunnyvale as home.\n\nAs a well-traveled Anglophone, I felt no culture shock when I arrived in America, with the exception of the \"do-it-yourself\" culture common to the Western world. I was a Bombay brat who always had house help to cook and clean for me. In the US, I tortured my gut bacteria with junk food for months before grudgingly learning my way around the kitchen.\n\nIn my head, I thought I'd only take a short break from work following my relocation. It took around six months after landing in the States to get my work authorization, known as the EAD, and then, I was all set to pick up my pen and notepad and return to work as a journalist.\n\nBut I found landing full-time work extremely difficult. Every day, I searched online job portals for journalism roles to apply to, but I was either ghosted or rejected every time.\n\nIsolation made these rejections harder to handle. Friendless \"visa brides,\" as I sometimes call immigrants of my ilk, have no one to share their burdens with.\n\nAlthough I did make friends over time, it was extremely difficult to connect with people initially, because loneliness is baked into suburban Californian life. In contrast to the throbbing metropolis of Mumbai, the Bay Area is quiet and boring, with vast distances between any two places of interest. It's not unusual to have to take multiple freeways to get to a grocery store or restaurant. Some roads don't even have footpaths for you to walk on. Public transport is a joke, so in these soulless suburbs, your car becomes a detachable extension of your body.\n\nA few months into my life in the Bay, I knew I was experiencing something that went beyond homesickness. I cried frequently, sometimes breaking down in public places. I slept badly, worried constantly, and lost my confidence. It felt like I was having a breakdown in slow motion.\n\nLearning how to drive, and getting my license in February 2023, was a big part of my emotional recovery. I'd always been afraid of driving, but now I've overcome it, I'm no longer dependent on my husband for transport. I have at long last befriended the asphalt.\n\nOne of my first long-distance drives was to a town called Turlock, nearly 100 miles from my place, where I did a live poetry reading.\n\nFinancially, I had to depend on my husband while I struggled to find work. But over the past three years, I've picked up some freelance writing assignments, which have granted me some financial freedom, and I've been able to lease my own car, a gorgeous black Tesla.\n\nI'm not the first \"visa wife,\" nor will I be the last. My story is the story of many women who've put oceans between themselves and their family, friends, and work, to move for love. My experience with immigration has taught me that when you move countries, your skills come with you, and if you believe in yourself, they can help you rebuild your professional identity.\n\nI'm proud to have strengthened my identity as a writer during this difficult time. I've written news articles for local outlets, works of fiction and poetry, and non-fiction essays based on my experience as an immigrant. For me, \"home\" is a place where people know my name, and building up professional recognition in the US has given me a greater sense of belonging.\n\nThat said, even though I've picked up temporary work, like contract jobs and freelance gigs, full-time employment remains elusive. I'm still actively looking for jobs, but I've come to believe that the struggle has less to do with my own abilities than imperfect algorithms on job portals, a volatile job market, and a general skew in the Bay Area toward software and technological skills, which makes me feel less in demand as a writer.\n\nI don't write code. I write stories. In \"Alf layla wa Layla,\" an ancient West Asian collection of folk tales, popularly known as \"The Arabian Nights,\" it takes princess Scheherazade a thousand nights to find the path to survival through storytelling.\n\nI fancy myself a modern-day Scheherazade in Sunnyvale, and, having lived as a writer in Silicon Valley for over a thousand days now, I think I'll survive too.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being on an H-4 or another dependent visa?

    "description": "The Department of Education is placing a $65,000 cap on the Parent PLUS program in July, limiting the amount of student loans parents can take on.",
    "fullText": "Parents could see big student-loan changes in the new year.\n\nBeginning July 1, 2026, the Department of Education will begin implementing President Donald Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul, which he signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nThe overhaul includes new income-driven repayment plans and lower borrowing caps — including for the Parent PLUS program, which allowed parents to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their kids' educations. The department is planning to impose a $65,000 lifetime borrowing limit per dependent student, or $20,000 per year, which will limit parents' ability to use federal financing to help send their children to college.\n\nThe new borrowing cap would apply to parents taking out new loans in 2026. Existing Parent PLUS borrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2026, can continue borrowing at their existing terms until 2028.\n\nAdditionally, parents who take out loans after July 1 will only have access to the standard repayment plan and will not be able to enroll in the new Repayment Assistance Plan, which the Department of Education is rolling out to replace existing income-driven repayment plans.\n\nA September analysis from the Brookings Institution said that, based on data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey and the College Scorecard, 7.7% of undergrad students had parents who took out Parent PLUS loans at an average amount of $16,272 in the 2019-2020 school year. Higher-income families borrowed higher amounts: the analysis said that among families earning more than $130,000 annually, 46% took out more than $20,000 in Parent PLUS loans each year.\n\n\"However, these patterns mask a crucial insight: While lower-income families borrow smaller absolute amounts, they face significantly higher debt-to-income ratios,\" the analysis said, meaning that the repayment burden tends to be greater for lower-income families despite borrowing at lower amounts.\n\nParent PLUS loans also tend to have the highest interest rates among federal student loans, currently standing at 8.94%. Still, the analysis said, they have several advantages, including access to more flexible repayment options and interest deductions on federal taxes.\n\nThe new limits could leave parents looking for alternative options to help pay for their kids' educations, including turning to private lending, which tends to have higher interest rates with riskier terms. They come as the department is also eliminating the Grad PLUS loan program and placing new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, with the goal of curbing excessive student-loan borrowing.",

    "description": "Meta is buying Manus for over $2 billion. Here's what the AI agent does, who built it, and why the deal matters.",
    "fullText": "Manus is back in the spotlight.\n\nThe Chinese-founded artificial intelligence startup is being acquired by Meta in a deal reported to be worth more than $2 billion — one of the most high-profile instances of a US tech giant buying an Asian AI company.\n\nManus grabbed headlines in March when it unveiled an AI agent designed to autonomously execute tasks like résumé screening and stock analysis.\n\nThe startup was founded in China and moved its headquarters to Singapore in mid-2025.\n\nLaunched in March by the Chinese AI product studio Butterfly Effect, Manus has been pitched by its creators as the world's first \"general\" AI agent — a system designed to carry out tasks independently.\n\nSince its launch, the startup has continued to expand what the agent can do, rolling out features that allow users to use Manus for design work, slide creation, and completing tasks directly through a web browser.\n\nManus can independently execute complex tasks, such as market research, coding, and data analysis, Meta said when it announced the acquisition on Monday.\n\nBusiness Insider tested the tool in its early stages in March and found it ambitious but uneven in execution, including instances where it hallucinated data.\n\nEarlier this month, Manus said it had surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, with its total revenue run rate — including usage-based fees and other income streams — exceeding $125 million.\n\nThe company in April raised $75 million in funding led by Benchmark, at a valuation of about $500 million, Bloomberg reported. Manus said in an update this month that it now employs about 105 people across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco, and plans to open a Paris office soon.\n\nManus was founded by Xiao Hong, a Chinese entrepreneur and software engineer who is also the CEO of Butterfly Effect.\n\nKnown as \"Red\" in China's tech circles, Xiao was born in 1992 and studied software engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in central China.\n\nAfter graduating, Xiao founded Nightingale Technology in 2015, where he developed enterprise productivity tools, including the Yi Ban assistant for WeChat, which gained millions of users in China.\n\nIn 2022, he launched Butterfly Effect and rolled out Monica, an AI-powered browser extension that aggregates multiple large language models. Following the acquisition, Xiao will take on a vice president role at Meta.\n\nXiao was joined at Manus by co-founder Ji Yichao, also known as \"Peak Ji,\" who was chief scientist at Butterfly Effect. Ji leads technical and infrastructure development at Manus.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ji was the public face of Manus at launch, introducing the AI agent in its debut video in March. Ji has a long track record of building consumer technology products, and was named to MIT Technology Review's Innovators Under 35 list this year.\n\nThe founding team also includes Zhang Tao, who leads product at Manus. He was head of global product at ByteDance from 2022 to 2023 and has held multiple product roles, including serving as a product manager at Tencent, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nMeta said the acquisition is part of its effort to scale general-purpose AI agents across its apps and services.\n\nThe company said in its announcement on Monday that it plans to keep Manus running as a stand-alone product while integrating its technology into Meta's wider AI offerings.\n\nManus said the deal would not be disruptive for its customers and that it would continue to sell and operate its subscription service. The company will also continue to operate from Singapore.\n\n\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" said Xiao.\n\nBuying Manus could give Meta an AI revenue boost and give it a distribution advantage, Business Insider's Hugh Langley wrote.\n\nManus's links to China have drawn scrutiny.\n\nIn May, Sen. John Cornyn questioned US investment in Manus in a post on X. He asked whether American capital should back AI companies with ties to China as competition with Beijing intensifies.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, a Meta spokesperson said the deal would fully sever Manus's remaining ties to China.\n\n\"There will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI following the transaction, and Manus AI will discontinue its services and operations in China,\" the spokesperson told Business Insider. This includes shutting down the AI assistant, Monica, and relocating relevant employees.\n\nManus employees who join Meta will not have access to customer data, and Meta will continue to geo-block access to its AI models, the spokesperson added.",

    "fullText": "The year is 2026. Robots enter the home, while white-collar workers pour into the streets to protest artificial intelligence.\n\nThat's the near future, according to one venture capitalist who's betting heavily on how AI reshapes daily life and work.\n\nEthan Choi is a partner at Khosla Ventures, where he invests in companies he believes can define entire markets. His portfolio include the enterprise search giant Glean; fintech Ramp, whose valuation jumped to $32 billion in a recent funding round; and ClickHouse, the fast-growing data startup taking aim at Snowflake. Before joining Khosla, Choi was a partner at Accel.\n\nWe asked Choi how he expects the year ahead to unfold, which areas are ripe for investment, and which trend will lose steam. The interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nWhat's one investment theme you'll lean into in 2026?\n\nIn 2026, we'll see robotics experience its own GPT-3 moment. Not a mass consumer breakthrough like ChatGPT, but a foundational leap in capability.\n\nOne of the leading robotics models will demonstrate human-level intelligence applied to the physical world, mastering complex spatial, temporal, and embodied tasks that mark the beginning of true general-purpose robotics.\n\nWhat's something in your space that will lose steam?\n\nWe will find out whether there is a real consumer behavioral change towards building vibe-coding apps and whether these apps have durable value or if enterprises can find durable use cases beyond prototyping.\n\nHow do you expect the exit environment to evolve? Bonus points if you want to name who is going out to IPO first.\n\nMany folks are expecting a meaningful market correction in 2026. If that's the case, we'll continue to see more M&A than IPOs but I still believe the strongest companies can go out in any environment.\n\nGrayscale, a crypto asset manager, will go out first.\n\nOther candidates will be Ethos and Klook.\n\nHow do you see the balance of power shifting between large platforms and startups, or between founders and investors?\n\nWe are seeing even more egregious valuations and behavior from founders and investors relative to zero interest-rate policy times, and I have a hard time seeing how we can sustain these kinds of private valuations without commensurate explosive revenue materializing.\n\nHow will company building change in 2026?\n\nWe're seeing that the motions of building teams are evolving significantly towards a more efficient and AI-powered future.\n\nOn the product and engineering side, we are seeing the role of the product manager being challenged with the engineering org taking on more responsibility of understanding end-customer needs and driving product roadmap, with the help of AI that can synthesize vast quantities of customer feedback.\n\nOn the go-to-market side, we are seeing leaner sales functions with the ability to use AI to help with targeting, outreach, and customer engagement.\n\nGive us your most out-there, contrarian prediction.\n\nWe'll have the first of dramatic anti-AI protests in certain countries with white-collar workers, not blue-collar workers, demanding job security in the face of AI disruption.",

    "fullText": "While some retailers are scaling back in 2026, others are expanding their footprints across the US.\n\nThe success of discount retailers like Dollar General and Nordstrom Rack suggests that American consumers are rewarding retailers that can offer them deals over those that charge full price for groceries and apparel.\n\nFor now, 2026 openings appear to be on track to outpace closures, which now tally at around 300 announced so far. In 2025, store closures reached over 4,100.\n\nWhile retailers like Macy's cut back on stores to focus on their digital footprint, these retailers are finding ways to capitalize on expansion in the physical retail space.\n\nSee the list of major openings below.\n\nOn a December 4 earnings call, Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos told analysts that the company plans to open 450 new stores in 2026. It's a step down from the planned 575 in 2025, but Vasos said there's no need to race to fill the vacant retail space left by competitors.\n\n\"Our competition today is really not opening a lot of stores,\" Vasos said on the call. \"We don't feel compelled to have to rush to open a lot of stores.\n\nDiscount retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet showed a strong performance in foot traffic and store openings 2025, and its growth appears to be continuing in 2026.\n\nThe company said on a December earnings call that it's targeting 75 new stores for fiscal year 2026.\n\nBarnes & Noble is set to open 60 new stores in 2026, and has attributed its success to its new decentralized strategy, Fox Business reported on December 23.\n\n\"Barnes & Noble is enjoying a period of tremendous growth as the strategy to hand control of each bookstore to its local booksellers has proven so successful,\" the company told Fox Business in a statement.\n\nThe book chain was acquired by activist firm Elliott Management in 2019, which jumped at the opportunity to turn the business around as it faced competition from online channels like Amazon. Today, Elliott is reportedly eyeing an IPO along with the new stores openings in 2026, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn a series of press releases published in 2024 and 2025, discount apparel retailer Nordstrom Rack announced plans to open at least 13 new stores across the US throughout the spring and fall of 2026.\n\nThe new locations include states like Massachusetts, New Jersey, Virginia, and California.\n\nJapanese apparel retailer Uniqlo is expected to expand by 11 new stores in the US in 2026, according to an announcement obtained by Retail Dive in October.\n\nThe openings reportedly include two new flagship stores in Chicago and San Francisco.\n\n\"These new stores are not only a milestone of our growth, but a way of honoring the customers who welcomed us two decades ago and continue to inspire everything we do,\" Fuminori Adachi, Uniqulo's US CEO, said in a statement to Retail Dive.\n\nOutdoor lifestyle brand L.L. Bean announced on December 9 that it has plans for a \"major retail expansion in 2026,\" which includes the opening of eight new stores across the US. The new locations will bring the brand's total stores to 76 nationwide.\n\n\"We continue to see physical retail as an essential part of our growth strategy,\" said Greg Elder, L.L.Bean chief retail officer. \"Our 2026 expansion reflects our commitment to reaching more people who share our love for the outdoors.\"\n\nThe One Group Hospitality, which acquired the Japanese restaurant chain Benihana in 2024, announced an agreement on December 29 that secured it the development rights to 10 Benihana or Benihana Express locations.\n\nThe deal is expected to see two Benihana locations open in 2026 with the remaining locations to open over the next seven years.",

    "description": "Hedge funds continued their momentum in 2025, delivering strong performance. But historically high correlations to the S&P 500 pose risks.",
    "fullText": "Hedge funds entered 2025 with momentum and optimism.\n\nAfter a banner year in 2024, Goldman Sachs' February outlook report found \"buoyant sentiment\" among investors following \"unequivocally one of the best years for the hedge fund industry in recent memory.\" More than 90% of allocators told the bank their hedge fund portfolios met or exceeded expectations — the highest share on record, Goldman said.\n\nInvestors have rewarded that confidence with another strong year. Through November, hedge funds gained 10.8% in 2025, according to PivotalPath's composite index, putting the industry on pace to eclipse 2024. Nearly every major strategy has delivered positive returns.\n\nFlows have followed performance. According to hedge fund administrator Citco, $74 billion poured into the industry through November. Hedge fund assets hit the $5 million mark at the end of September, according to industry watcher Hedge Fund Research.\n\nBut as the book closes on 2025, risks are emerging that have investors on edge, even amid the strong run.\n\nSeveral popular hedge fund strategies are exhibiting historically high correlations with the S&P 500, according to a \"market risk alert\" from industry data provider PivotalPath, which increases the risk of sharp losses in a broader market correction.\n\n\"With markets at all-time highs and the economy potentially cooling significantly, elevated correlations may catch investors off guard in an equity sell-off,\" the report reads.\n\n\"A lot of this data caught people off guard,\" Jon Caplis, CEO of industry research firm PivotalPath, told Business Insider.\n\nMultistrategy hedge funds have been investor darlings in recent years, capturing a disproportionate share of the industry's inflows, primarily because they have delivered uncorrelated returns — and in some periods, even negatively correlated — to the broader market. Now, however, they are showing their highest 12-month rolling correlation to equities since 2011.\n\nHedge fund allocators \"continue to voice concerns around strategy over-exposure to the US large cap equity space,\" the report says.\n\nWhile some of the largest multistrategy funds have maintained market neutrality, many others have not, Caplis said.\n\n\"The ones who deliberately manage factor exposure have maintained neutrality, though often with additional effort,\" he said. \"For the rest, increasing correlations across risk factors have pushed their portfolios closer to equity markets.\"\n\nEvent-driven strategies face a similar challenge. The category — dominated by merger arbitrage and distressed credit — has suffered from a lack of opportunities over the past year. With M&A and bankruptcy activity subdued, managers have tended to increase equity exposure rather than sit on idle cash, Caplis said.\n\nUnderlying many of these correlation trends is AI-driven FOMO — fear of missing out — as investors crowded into AI-adjacent stocks, helping propel the S&P 500 higher in 2025.\n\n\"People don't want to underperform the market significantly,\" Caplis said. \"At the end of the day, it's very hard to get away from the AI factor.\"",

    "fullText": "When Frederick Baba left Goldman Sachs after nearly a decade, he didn't send the typical farewell note on his way out the door.\n\nThe former Goldman partner — who left the bank to join the secretive quant-trading firm Jane Street in late 2023 — published a surprisingly candid reflection on LinkedIn this week, revealing that colleagues once considered him \"challenging to work with.\" He shared the goodbye note he originally sent to Goldman staff to mark two years since leaving the firm.\n\nBaba — one of Business Insider's Rising Stars of Wall Street in 2020 — wrote that he believed colleagues had viewed him as difficult for years, and conceded they may have had a point.\n\nHe fixated on driving concrete results, he said — \"I was obsessive about commercial outcomes, I had a lot of opinions about things\" — and pushed his views so forcefully that he could come off as polarizing. \"I focused more on winning arguments than getting people to come along with me,\" he continued.\n\nAt Goldman, Baba drew wider attention for a 2020 email he wrote about the experience of being Black following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. In late 2022, he reached the upper echelons of the firm when the then-managing director on the systematic market making team was promoted to the rank of partner. That authority came with unintended consequences.\n\n\"As I became more senior, I became effective at getting people to do as I say,\" he reminisced, \"but I noticed a chilling effect on outside ideas, making it harder to know if I was actually right.\"\n\nA central theme running through the letter was the idea that leaders should make disagreement easy and safe. As he put it: \"Present your arguments gently, make it easy for people to disagree with you, and actively seek feedback and opposing viewpoints.\"\n\nThe note included thoughts for senior leaders and junior analysts alike. Baba said Goldman taught him how to rally people behind ideas and develop others to take on larger roles.\n\nHe encouraged current managers to do the same: \"To the current leaders: Cascade information, give feedback, and teach them to drive. An early manager at GS would often say that he couldn't move up if there was no one else to do the job he was currently doing. The teams I've worked on have performed at the highest levels when the people leading them delegated and elevated effectively.\"\n\nHe urged newcomers to high finance to evaluate their careers over one-, three-, and five-year timeframes. And landing a promotion, he noted, rarely happens by chance. He said he checked in regularly with senior stakeholders, sought broad feedback, and made sure the results of his work aligned with their expectations.\n\nBaba also quoted a line from a 2003 Jay-Z song, beginning with a recording by Biggie, saying: \"The key to staying on top of things is to treat everything like it's your first project. Like it's your first day working as an intern.\"\n\nHe closed with reflections on the reputation he hoped to leave behind.\n\n\"We don't get to choose how people remember or speak about us,\" he wrote. \"People often talk about leaving a legacy, but ultimately how we're remembered and spoken of is a separate thing to who we choose to be, how we show up, and how we treat others.\"",

    "description": "The Social Security payment schedule for 2026 is out. Learn how birth dates affect payment timing and take note of key calendar dates.",
    "fullText": "Each month, 74 million Americans receive their Social Security checks.\n\nThe payments — which are typically between $800 and $3,000 a month — make up the US' largest social safety net. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of seniors who rely on Social Security to afford essentials like housing, groceries, and healthcare.\n\nOlder adults are first eligible for payments beginning at age 62, but they can claim their highest possible benefit amount around age 70. In addition to income for seniors, the Social Security Administration provides financial support to low-income households and individuals with disabilities.\n\nThere will be some Social Security changes in 2026: a cost-of-living adjustment will be applied to all payments, Medicare costs are set to increase, and some seniors will see additional tax relief.\n\nThe monthly payment schedule, however, will remain similar to 2025. Beneficiaries with a birth date between the 1st and 10th of the month will be paid on the second Wednesday; beneficiaries with a birth date between the 11th and 20th will be paid on the third Wednesday; And beneficiaries with a birthday from the 21st to 31st will be paid on the fourth Wednesday. For new enrollees, payments can begin as soon as their claims are processed by the SSA.\n\nSupplemental Social Security is available to low-income Americans and some older adults with disabilities. Beneficiaries can expect their checks at the beginning or end of each month. For those receiving both standard benefits and SSI, payments will be made on the 3rd and 1st of each month, respectively.\n\nBeneficiaries who began claiming Social Security before May 1997 will be paid on the third of the month too, regardless of their birthday.\n\nBelow is the 2026 payment calendar.",

    "title": "The Silicon Valley leaders who have experimented with psychedelics",
    "description": "Silicon Valley has a long history with psychedelics, and some of its best-known leaders have tried, like Bill Gates, Sam Altman, and Bryan Johnson.",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley have dabbled in psychedelics.\n\nThe psychedelic movement isn't limited to the most successful tech moguls in Silicon Valley. A rising number of entrepreneurs and executives are turning to psychedelics like LSD, ayahuasca, and MDMA to find inspiration in their professional lives.\n\nWhile psychedelics haven't reached mainstream status, they're gaining popularity in certain circles. Startups focused on psychedelics are also drawing increasing interest and investment from prominent figures, including startup accelerators like Y Combinator and billionaires such as Peter Thiel.\n\nTech entrepreneur and longevity aficionado Bryan Johnson is the latest to make headlines for trying magic mushrooms on a social-media livestream. Read on to learn about which tech founders and billionaires have experimented with these substances — on and off the playa.\n\n48-year-old Bryan Johnson began his career as a tech entrepreneur before making headlines for his extreme attempts to defy aging.\n\nWith a regimen that the longevity guru said costs him $2 million a year, Johnson has tried countless supplements, diets, and other health experiments. However, a five-and-a-half hour livestream on X where he took with magic mushrooms might be one of his more unusual pursuits.\n\nJohnson was joined by his son, his father, Grimes, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and several other business leaders. As part of what he deemed the \"most quantified psychedelic experiment in history,\" Johnson was measured for 249 biomarkers, underwent brain scans, and collected various other measurements throughout the trip. Johnson has hypothesized that taking magic mushrooms may help humans live past 120 years old.\n\nThe entrepreneur has also opened up about his experience smoking toad venom. In an episode of the \"Core Memory\" podcast in August, Johnson said he turned to psychedelic compound 5-MeO-DMT, found in the venom of the Sonoran Desert Toad, to explore the convergence of mind and machine. He said he wanted to create a \"map\" of human consciousness, and achieved his goal with the psychedelic.\n\nThe experience was so impactful that the longevity enthusiast said he got a tattoo of the 5-MeO-DMT molecule.\n\nLate Apple cofounder Steve Jobs didn't shy away from speaking about his experiences with LSD. The entrepreneur spent his early 20s searching for the meaning of life through meditation, traveling, and, sometimes, LSD.\n\n\"I came of age at a magical time,\" Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson.\n\nThe billionaire described taking LSD as a \"profound experience\" and one of the most important things in his life.\n\n\"It reinforced my sense of what was important — creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could,\" Jobs said.\n\nIn the two-year period between 1972 and 1974, Jobs used LSD 10 to 15 times before he stopped for good, according to a questionnaire he filled out in 1988 for government security clearance.\n\nOpenAI cofounder and CEO Sam Altman said in a 2024 appearance on the \"Life in Seven Songs\" podcast that doing psychedelics was one of the most transformative experiences of his life.\n\nThe billionaire said he used to be a \"very anxious, unhappy person\" and now feels \"calm.\"\n\n\"If you had told me that, like, one weekend-long retreat in Mexico was going to significantly change that, I would have said absolutely not,\" Altman said in the podcast. \"And it really did.\"\n\nWhile the CEO said he had used psychedelics at Burning Man, he said those experiences had been rare and less impactful. He said the \"life-changing\" experiences were the ones where he traveled for the experience and took psychedelics with a guide.\n\nAltman has invested in a number of medical startups, including one focused on psychedelics. The billionaire served as the board chairman of a startup called Journey Colab that aims to help people suffering from addiction with the development and application of clinical psychedelic drugs for therapy.\n\nGoogle cofounder Sergey Brin has reportedly consumed psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nWhile Brin hasn't confirmed his usage publicly and didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, the cofounder previously attended Burning Man with Eric Schmidt to see if Schmidt had it in him to be Google's CEO.\n\nThe cofounder has also funds into a nonprofit investment firm called Catalyst4, which has pledged $15 million to Soneira, a startup studying the effects of a hallucinogenic mental health treatment.\n\nBefore founding Microsoft and becoming a billionaire philanthropist, Bill Gates experimented a bit with psychedelic substances.\n\nGates spoke about his experiences with acid on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and included an anecdote about Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, who suggested he \"take acid\" to help with his design taste. Gates said on the show that \"he got the batch that's about code,\" not design.\n\nGates also revealed details of his past drug use in his memoir, \"Source Code: My Beginnings.\" The billionaire said he initially declined acid when Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen asked him to try it in high school. When he was asked as a senior, though, he decided to try it out. He said the experience was at first exhilarating, but he wasn't sure what was going on the next morning when he had to get a dental procedure done.\n\nLater in college, Gates tried LSD again on a friend's birthday and described the experience as \"cosmic.\" It also made him think that his brain could delete memories like a computer — and he said it would be one of the last times he tried LSD.\n\nGoogle DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis spoke in a June interview about why he's not interested in psychedelics.\n\nWhen asked if LSD ever helped him understand the \"nature of reality,\" Hassabis said gaming and reading science fiction, and science helped him find those answers. The AI executive said he values mental acuity for his work and said he was \"too worried about the effects\" of LSD on his brain.\n\n\"I've done too much neuroscience,\" Hassabis said. \"I've sort of finely tuned my mind to work in this way. I need it for where I'm going.\"",

    "description": "Come for the Liberation Day stock-market crash. Stay for Nvidia's ascent to a $5 trillion valuation.",
    "fullText": "2025 was a wild year for markets of all kinds.\n\nEverything from stocks to crypto to commodities experienced a rollercoaster ride that amounted to what felt like an especially volatile year.\n\nSome of the key events feel like ages ago. (Remember when China's DeepSeek AI model spurred a panic across US tech?) Others are more recent. (It's been hard to miss the record-setting rallies in metals.)\n\nAll in all, it ended up another solidly green year for stocks and commodities, while bitcoin ultimately fell. Here's the final scorecard for some of the most high-profile parts of the market:\n\nWith that in mind, detailed below — in rough chronological order — are the wildest moments that defined the year for investors:\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his wife unveiled their own crypto tokens the day leading up to the presidential inauguration.\n\nThe move, which was unprecedented for a US president and raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest within the new administration, also kicked off a flurry of interest in meme coins.\n\nPerformance-wise, the Trump-branded tokens have floundered throughout the year. $Trump, which soared to around $45 the night leading up to the inauguration, has plummeted 90% from its peak. $Melania, which climbed to $8.48 in late January, has endured a 98% plunge.\n\nAI stocks were shaken by the launch of DeepSeek in January, the Chinese AI chatbot that appeared to rival ChatGPT's abilities despite using cheaper and inferior Nvidia chips. In a single day, fears around DeepSeek wiped away around $1 trillion in value, largely in the US tech sector.\n\nThe LLM was one of the first catalysts to spark concern about the billions mega-cap tech firms in the US are spending on AI, and whether the investment would be worth it from an ROI perspective. It also sparked fear that the US could be losing its dominance in the artificial intelligence space.\n\nCrypto suffered a brutal sell-off in the months following Trump's inauguration, undoing much of the rally that sent tokens rocketing higher after the self-branded \"crypto president\" first won the election in November.\n\nBitcoin, the OG cryptocurrency, rallied to a peak of around $106,000 in late January before tumbling 28% to $75,000 in early April.\n\nEthereum, the second-largest crypto token, plunged around 60% from its peak in December through mid-April.\n\nCrypto markets got a big boost when Trump first secured his second term in office, with investors being excited by the prospect of a more crypto-friendly administration. That optimism has fluctuated at various points throughout the year, tied to factors like concerns about Fed rate cuts and broader risk sentiment in the market.\n\nWho could forget the stock market crash that ensued when Trump unveiled his Liberation Day tariffs?\n\nThe president, who had teased April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" for the US in posts on Truth Social, followed through with his threats to impose sweeping tariffs on the US's top trading partners, which included a 10% universal tariff and reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 nations.\n\nInvestors immediately panicked over the economic implications of tariffs and whether they could stoke higher prices, burdening an already slowing US economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 plunged 12% from its closing price on April 2 through the following Tuesday. At its low, the index was down 19% from its peak in mid-February, on the cusp of bear-market territory.\n\nPresident Trump intensified his attacks on the Fed Chair at various points throughout the year.\n\nTrump, who appointed Jerome Powell to the role during his first term, has long pressured Powell to lower rates at his whim. But his feud with the central bank chief appeared to reach a new level this year as he called on rates to be lowered ASAP and referred to Powell as \"stupid,\" \"Too Late,\" and other names on Truth Social.\n\nIn April, Trump said that Powell leaving the Fed couldn't come soon enough, leading US stocks to drop sharply.\n\nStocks sold off again in July when Bloomberg reported that Trump could fire Powell soon. The 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term rates in the economy, also rose in these instances.\n\nThe comments from Trump's administration are considered by many to be unprecedented, given that most past presidents have let the Fed operate independently. They've also sparked fear that inflation could rise if the president were to intervene in monetary policy, which could raise rates in the long run.\n\nIn April, Trump clarified that he had no intention of firing Powell from his post. But the president still appeared to flirt with the idea as a hypothetical when speaking to reporters at the Mar-a-Lago this week.\n\nTesla staged a massive turnaround this year after plummeting over the first four months of 2025.\n\nShares of the EV maker were down more than 50% from their peak in December 2024, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk's presence on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe stock is now up more than 100% from its April low, driven by a handful of catalysts.\n\nMusk, who has long frustrated Tesla investors with his many side-projects and growing involvement in US politics, appeared to ignite the rebound in April when he said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first quarter earnings call.\n\nThe stock moved higher in the coming months as the Tesla board approved a pay package with ambitious targets for Musk, and Musk signaled his commitment to the company by purchasing another $1 billion worth of Tesla stock.\n\nThe US struck a series of trade agreements with China, which helped stocks grind higher to new records this summer. Here's the timeline of what happened:\n\nThe long-running rift between the US and China on trade has been one of the biggest issues weighing on investors this year, particularly within the context of Trump's latest tariffs. When trade tensions were at their peak, the US was threatening to slap a 145% tariff on goods imported from the nation, and China was threatening to impose a 125% tariff on US goods.\n\nTesla shares swung in June as Elon Musk and Donald Trump had a massive falling out online.\n\nThe two billionaires began to spar on their respective social media platforms after Musk published a post criticizing the Republicans' tax and spending bill. Tesla shares plunged 17% in the two days following June 3, when Musk first posted about the bill.\n\nIn the heat of the conflict, Trump threatened to slash government contracts with Musk's sprawling empire of companies. The White House also said Trump was considering giving away or selling the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year to support Musk.\n\nOn X the following week, Musk said that he believed his posts about Trump \"went too far.\" In an interview with The New York Post on the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice,\" which appeared to alleviate the selling pressure on Tesla.\n\nThe stock ended up climbing 6% to end the week.\n\nNvidia, the world's most valuable company by market cap, became the first-ever to hit a $4 trillion valuation in July. It was also the first to hit the $5 trillion milestone in October.\n\nShares of the chipmaker are up 35% year-to-date and up 1,338% over the last five years, speaking to the enormous hype surrounding AI hardware.\n\nGold, silver, and copper each rallied to all-time highs as investors sought out alternative investments that could hedge against risk and took interest in metals related to the AI trade.\n\nAll of the metals are also facing a supply-demand imbalance, another factor that's pushed up prices.\n\nHere's how each performed in 2025:\n\nGold and silver are on track for their best year since 1979. Copper, meanwhile, is on track for its best performance since the Great Financial Crisis.",

    "description": "D'yan Forest, 91, is the Guinness World Record holder for oldest working female comedian. She advise young people to always be learning something new.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to interview is based on a conversation with D'yan Forest, 91, who is the Guinness World Record holder for oldest working female comedian, a title she has held since she was 87. Forest said she works to stay active physically and mentally, keeping her mind sharp and her life fulfilling. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was born in 1934. When I was five years old, my mother couldn't stand me banging on the piano, so I got piano lessons. I learned classical piano, and then I wanted to do pantomime. I took drama lessons, then singing lessons. I had all these skills, but in 1958, my husband said to me, \"You can't be an entertainer. They're all loose women.\" That stopped my show career. I got a divorce a couple of years later and said, \"The heck with this.\"\n\nI went to Paris in the 1960s, and I had a ball. It was so different from where I lived in Boston. I was sitting in a nightclub playing piano and singing, and I thought, \"This is fun.\" I took more lessons, and then I started working in Boston as a pianist and vocalist working private parties.\n\nIn 1966, I came to New York, and immediately, I got into a union and started working. I became a French chanteuse — a female singer. After all these years of working in Paris, I came home with a French accent, and I couldn't lose it. I sang in nine languages. I couldn't get into commercials that easily because of the accent, so I took drama lessons to speak English properly.\n\nI was playing all over in these nice places, including the Waldorf Astoria. I started doing cabaret and performed in the 1970s and 1980s. Whenever orchestra leaders needed to have a French evening or an Italian evening, I always kicked off. I would wander the tables with a keyboard.\n\nI worked very hard. I also worked as a substitute teacher, but I never took a full-time job, because in the evenings I would be working in cocktail lounges. I also received an inheritance.\n\nI started being in off-off-Broadway shows, being whatever characters they needed. I had two or three careers going with whoever called. In the meantime, I traveled to Europe and I spent the next couple of years as an international singer.\n\nAfter 9/11, everybody in New York and the surrounding areas was very depressed, and the clubs didn't need entertainers anymore. There was no work for a while, but while playing golf with the owner of a comedy club, I asked her how to get into comedy. She got me in touch with a coach. I did my first comedy show, and I was petrified. By the third night, though, people were laughing, and I was hooked on comedy.\n\nWhen you do piano bars, you're working six or seven hours at night, but here, within 10 minutes, I was getting people laughing.\n\nPeople tried telling me I shouldn't do comedy, and I was too old. People thought I would get made fun of, or the shows would be too late for me. I didn't listen to anybody, and I just did it, and that's one of the huge lessons I learned.\n\nMy career has only gotten better and better. Even this summer, I was working almost every week doing my own comedy show. I did shows in Chicago and Wisconsin, and I recently did some in London. I am busier than ever, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm old. I got into the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest-working female comedian in the world.\n\nSometimes in show business, you're very busy, like I've been this summer. But sometimes, you don't do anything at all. I advise young people to always get another career because you never know what's going to happen, as well as save your money for the low times. You're always knowing that there will be a next job.\n\nThe problem is I'm still paying back my student loans — a joke — that's not it. Why I'm really doing it is to keep my brain busy. I'm 91, and a lot of my friends are in these assisted living places because they can't do things on their own. I'm positive and keep going because every day, I'm learning new lines, talking to new people, answering new questions, and working with young people all over the world.\n\nA week in my life is a lot of answering phones and working with my manager to figure out what to do. I have a show maybe three or four times a month at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York, and I have to memorize new stuff. I don't like to do the same thing for months and months, as I get bored with myself. I try to develop new lines or a new shtick.\n\nI have practically zero family left, so I have decided that the reason I love the career so much is because it's taking the place of a family and grandchildren. I have something to answer to, and it gives me a mission in life to be as good as I can become.\n\nI wish I had children and grandchildren, but it never happened that way. I was married for a couple of years, and he wasn't the right one, and then I never met anybody that I really wanted to marry again. I've brought up other people's children, and some of them even think of me as a grandmother now.\n\nI had cancer twice, once in my lung, and once in my breast. Then, I had some heart problems, and I wasn't recovering in France. When I came back to New York, I found out I had a heart attack. After a huge bout in the hospital, I finally got a pacemaker and a new valve. I'm on 12 pills a day for four different conditions.\n\nMy health at this point is very good. I go to physical therapy and many very good doctors. I try to swim every day, even in the winter, and I play golf a few days a month from April to October. I get a lot of walking in on the course, and I take lessons.\n\nMy future outlook is to keep working as much as possible. The problem for my manager and agent is to convince other venues that I do well with both a younger and older audience. I say that I'm younger than most people in my brain and my body. I'd like to think I'm universal, and I tell the truth in my story.\n\nI realize at heart, I'm still a teacher. I'd like to educate people on what life has been like since 1934 and make them laugh. I recently did a one-woman show on antisemitism throughout my life and what I experienced. The audience loved it, and I want to do more of that.",

    "fullText": "As the year winds down, the world's wealthiest are on the move on private jets and superyachts bound for a familiar set of ultra-exclusive holiday playgrounds.\n\nThe Caribbean Island of St. Barts draws tycoons, celebrities, and their entourages to an island where five-figure nightly rates are routine.\n\nFrom a harbor packed with floating mansions to invite-only beach-club parties and fireworks over Gustavia, the capital of St. Barts, the island has become the unofficial year-end meeting place for the global 0.001%.\n\nElsewhere, a handful of other luxury enclaves from Antigua to Cabo San Lucas fill out the rest of the holiday map.\n\nHere is what Business Insider could find out about where the ultrawealthy appear to be spending their New Year's Eve, mostly through data from MarineTraffic.\n\nJeff Bezos was spotted alongside Lauren Sánchez Bezos in Aspen, Colorado, for Christmas, but the pair may be heading for the Caribbean.\n\nBezos's yacht Koru has been spotted near St. Barts. The enormous yacht belonging to the billionaire founder of Amazon measures 417 feet long and features a large swimming pool on its deck.\n\nLaunchpad, the 387-foot megayacht that cost Mark Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO, more than $300 million, is floating in the Gulf of California after departing from La Paz, Mexico.\n\nWingman, the 220-foot support vessel, is also in proximity in the Gulf of California.\n\nThe location is near Cabo San Lucas, which has become a billionaire hot spot in recent years due to its natural scenery, private airports, and access to water sports.\n\nAhpo is 378 feet long, featuring a long lineup of amenities, including a piano, a beauty salon, a spa, a beach club, a VIP cabin, and a gym.\n\nQueen Miri, the yacht that belongs to Miriam Adelson, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and a major Republican donor, has been spotted in the Caribbean.\n\nAdelson's $70 million yacht can host up to 36 guests and is set to depart from Philipsburg, Sint Maarten, to Gustavia, St. Barts.\n\nDavid Geffen's yacht Rising Sun is anchored in St. Barts.\n\nThe billionaire entertainment mogul's 454-foot-long yacht, with 82 rooms, departed from Saint Thomas in the US Virgin Islands and has been in St. Barts since early December. The yacht was originally commissioned by Larry Ellison and designed by Jon Bannenberg. The Oracle CEO found it too large and sold it to Geffen instead.\n\nBravo Eugenia, the yacht of Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, has been in St. Barts since December 26.\n\nJones's yacht, named after his wife, Eugenia Jones, has been in the waters near St. Barts since the day after Christmas.

    "fullText": "Tesla had a surprise Christmas present for investors this year: more bad news about its EV business.\n\nElon Musk's automaker published a press release on Monday with a consensus of analyst predictions for the company's latest quarterly sales, the first time it has publicly given Wall Street such a heads-up.\n\nThe delivery consensus, which is a compilation of predictions from analysts selected by Tesla, estimated that the EV giant sold 422,850 vehicles in the last three months of 2025, around 14.6% fewer than the same period last year.\n\nThat's lower than Wall Street's wider expectations. Analysts were expecting Tesla to sell 440,907 EVs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIt's also a surprising move from Tesla, which typically does not issue public communications ahead of critical sales announcements.\n\nTesla, which is expected to report its latest quarterly sales as soon as Friday, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"This is highly unusual for Tesla to send out a press release with quarterly consensus delivery estimates,\" said Gary Black, managing partner at Future Fund, which sold its Tesla holdings in May.\n\nBlack wrote in the Tuesday post on X that the release suggested Tesla's Q4 sales were lower than the Bloomberg consensus and were, in his view, likely closer to 420,000.\n\nTesla's stock price hit a record high this month amid investor optimism over the company's robotaxi push, but the Cybertruck maker's core EV business has had a difficult year.\n\nTesla was hit hard by the collapse in electric car sales after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired in September.\n\nThe company's US sales reportedly fell to their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the launch of cheaper versions of Tesla's bestselling Model 3 and Y EVs.\n\nThings haven't gone much better outside the US. Tesla has been buffeted by fierce competition from local rivals in China, where an army of EV startups has rolled out high-tech electric vehicles at rock-bottom prices.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, the US automaker's sales have collapsed nearly 30% so far this year amid backlash over Musk's political interventions.\n\nThe slump has left Tesla facing a race against time to avoid its second consecutive annual sales decline.\n\nTesla has rolled out a range of incentives in the US and is pushing to introduce its Full Self-Driving tech in China and Europe, but the surprise delivery consensus estimated that Tesla will end the year having sold over 100,000 fewer EVs than in 2024.",

    "title": "I cover side hustles and started my own in 2025. Here's the best business advice I heard all year.",
    "description": "Among the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.",
    "fullText": "There's an overwhelming amount of business advice out there.\n\nI hear a lot of it, by nature of my reporting and asking successful entrepreneurs what they wished they'd done differently, or what they'd tell prospective founders. Ever since starting my own business selling pickleball paddles — inspired by the plethora of Amazon sellers I interview — I hear even more (often unsolicited) advice. Everyone has something to say.\n\nAmong the flood of advice I've received, read, and reported on in 2025, here's what stuck with me the most.\n\nI know it sounds clichéd to \"follow your passion,\" but if you're starting a business — especially as a side hustle — you don't want it to feel like work. You don't want it to feel like a pesky chore, because it's what you'll be doing at the end of your workday on a Wednesday night, or at the start of your weekend on a Saturday morning.\n\nEven when you're not dedicating time to the business, it has a way of seeping into your shower thoughts or preventing you from falling asleep at night. If something is going to take up so much space, it might as well be something you care about.\n\nMy business partner and I weren't always going to sell pickleball paddles. That idea came from a conversation with a top Amazon seller, whom we consulted in the ideation stage. He encouraged us to think about our interests and how we generally spend our time. \"What do you like? What are you good at?\" he asked us. \"Start there.\"\n\nAs former collegiate tennis players, it seemed obvious that we should incorporate racket sports in our e-commerce business — and I'm so glad we did, because if we were selling kitchen utensils or candles or something we didn't know anything about or care much for, I doubt we'd still be plugging away after a year of learning lessons and lackluster sales. But we are. We believe in our product, and we're having fun trying to move inventory. Rather than feeling burned out, we feel energized.\n\nFigure out what you want, identify someone who already has it, and ask them — politely — for a bit of their time. Then, ask questions. Get curious. This is good, general life and business advice that frequently comes up in interviews with people across all industries. I never tire of it.\n\nWhy try to do everything on your own when you can potentially learn from someone else's mistakes and fast-track your path to success?\n\nIn addition to seeking out mentors, put yourself in the same room — virtual or physical — as people with similar goals. I've heard it over and over again: Who you hang around matters.\n\n\"Networking event\" or \"conference\" doesn't sound particularly fun or exciting, especially to an introvert. Despite reporting on the benefits of attending such events, I had never bought in — until earlier this year, when I spent 10 hours at a conference for real estate investors pursuing financial independence.\n\nI wrote about what it was like being in a room with hundreds of like-minded investors, describing it as \"powerful,\" and mentioning three main takeaways:\n\nOne, you learn — from people who are more successful than you.\n\nTwo, you connect — with people who could become your business partner, mentor, or client.\n\nThree, you gain momentum — perhaps just enough to inspire a key pivot, or take your first step into business, or simply keep the fire burning.\n\nI love an underdog story. Who doesn't? I appreciate grit, and I also believe the underrated, chip-on-your-shoulder mindset can be an asset. Just look at Stephen Curry, who was largely overlooked at the college level before blossoming into an NBA MVP.\n\nOr, to keep things more relevant, consider Kyle Ray. He's a college dropout I spoke with earlier this year who turned his window cleaning side hustle into a six-figure business that services hundreds of clients across Texas.\n\nHe told me that he didn't do great in school and, from a young age, his teachers tried to convince him that \"the best you can hope for is to be a manager of a restaurant.\" Rather than capitulating, he used their declaration as fuel. \"That's just been an internal driver, like, 'I'm going to prove this person wrong.'\"\n\nPeople will tell you that your idea is bad or that it won't work. \"The pickleball space is too competitive,\" one naysayer told me. \"I wouldn't want to be in your shoes!\" said another.\n\nRather than letting unproductive feedback discourage you, use it as motivation. It's fun being an underdog with something to prove. It's also really difficult. Underdog status or not, building a profitable, lasting business takes time, effort, and perhaps even a stroke of luck or two. It's often a series of many small steps over the course of many months and years that lead to success worthy of a feature in a news publication.\n\nI'm hyper-aware that for every successful entrepreneur I interview, there are 100 who have failed. But I'm also aware that you won't have a chance if you don't at least try.",

    "description": "The Champagne industry has faced shocks from tariffs to declining alcohol consumption. After a disastrous 2024, it seems to be stabilizing.",
    "fullText": "Pour one out for your local Champagne seller.\n\nIt's been a shaky year for the French sparkling wine. The export market started at a low; it slipped 9.2% year-over-year in 2024. Then came the tariffs.\n\nThe industry also faces existential threats. Alcohol consumption is down across the US, specifically among young Americans, and while consumer spending remains high, middle-class Americans are starting to feel the pinch in their wallets. Will they still splurge on a nice bottle of Champagne?\n\nThe Champagne sellers that Business Insider spoke to were feeling wounded but hopeful.\n\nThe volume of Champagne consumed in the US between the first and third quarters of 2025 was up 3% compared to last year, according to beverage analytics firm IWSR. Between 2020 and 2025, the compounded annual growth rate of US consumption is flat at 0%.\n\n\"It's in a good place,\" said Koryn Ternes, a consulting manager at IWSR. \"It seems like the category is stabilizing.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's threat of a 200% tariff on European wine in March never materialized, to the relief of Champagne merchants. However, the industry is still facing a 15% tariff.\n\nExcess inventory from pre-tariff periods may be softening the blow. Part of the industry's struggle in 2023 and 2024, Ternes said, was that it stocked up during the 2022 post-pandemic boom. That led to a period of \"overhang,\" she said.\n\nBill Marci, the owner of the San Francisco Champagne Society, is only feeling the tariff shock now. While the prices of goods with shorter shelf lives, such as cheese and crackers, increased almost immediately, Marci had enough Champagne stored to last him at least six to nine months.\n\nThe end of the year brings lots of meetings between importers and distributors, Marci said. One importer he spoke to said the upcharge was closer to 30%: 15% of that is the tariff cost, and the other 15% was the combination of price increases from producers and a weak dollar.\n\nFactors like tariffs, rate cuts, growing government debt, and a decline in investor confidence have weakened the US dollar. For Champagne importers making purchases in Euros, this puts salt in the tariff wound.\n\nVineyard Road importer Michael Reiss contends that the value lost on the dollar is more like 8%, which he described as \"not nothing\" but small compared to the tariff effect. While a merchant may be able to ask a supplier for a 30-day payment delay, he said, the tariffs cannot be pushed or avoided.\n\n\"The tariff amount, you owe that before you owe anything,\" Reiss said. \"That money goes out the door quite quickly.\"\n\nThe uncertainty may cause even more damage, he said. This time of year, suppliers ask Reiss what his expectations are for 2026, but he doesn't know how to respond.\n\nThe tariffs have also led to some price creep. The question is: will consumers care? Marci's San Francisco-based business hasn't seen a difference.\n\n\"There's so much money in Silicon Valley, they don't even flinch,\" he said.\n\nIt's no secret that Americans are drinking less.\n\nA 2025 Gallup poll found that 53% of Americans have occasion to drink alcohol, a record low. Americans ages 18-34, normally a core client base for the alcohol business, have seen drinking rates fall by nine percentage points between 2023 and 2025, per Gallup.\n\nMarci has noticed a lack of Gen Z customers. He blames part of that on the slowdown of media buzz following his business's 2014 opening. Young people may also lack the experience to appreciate good Champagne. The only ones who do are European, he said.\n\nFor now, Marci's clientele sits comfortably between \"mid-30s and old enough to no longer pick up a glass.\" (And no, they haven't been asking for non-alcoholic Champagne.)\n\nReiss wasn't too worried about the decline.\n\n\"When people drink less, they do tend to drink better,\" Reiss said. The markets getting beaten up, he said, were for lower-priced generic wines.\n\nThen there's the state of the economy. While consumer spending continues to drive economic growth, chains from McDonald's to Home Depot have warned that middle-income consumers are cutting back.\n\n\"A $75-80 bottle retail would be a stretch for a significant part of the population,\" Reiss said. \"The group for which it's not a stretch is doing well and spending money.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another country is surging in its Champagne consumption: the UK.\n\nJames Simpson, the managing director of Pol Roger Limited and chairman of the Champagne Agents Association, said the country's consumption was bouncing back after an inflationary period.\n\n\"In the UK, we've still got the habit of drinking,\" he said.",

    "title": "I interviewed 80 executives in 2025. Here are 3 takeaways I learned from the people at the top.",
    "description": "I spoke with around 80 executives in 2025, and few of them followed a straight path to the top.",
    "fullText": "Sadly, there's no secret formula for success — but after speaking with dozens of leaders this year, I have a few ideas about what makes people at the top stand out.\n\nIn 2025, I interviewed around 80 executives, including more than 30 leaders at Fortune 500 companies, and roughly 20 CEOs or founders. They ranged from the heads of consumer-coveted brands like Whoop and Olipop, to the CEO behind CorePower Yoga, and senior leaders at major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.\n\nAfter speaking with leaders across various industries and company sizes, I can't say I discovered the blueprint for success. However, I did notice similar themes and patterns that kept popping up in our conversations.\n\nThese are the three takeaways I observed:\n\nA straight path to the C-suite was the exception, not the rule, among the executives I spoke with.\n\nEven those who started with Ivy League credentials experienced some twists or setbacks along the way. Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel, for example, told Business Insider that after losing his job in investment banking, he remained unemployed for two years and wrote a novel.\n\nOther executives started on completely different paths. The CEO of Brooks Running, a billion-dollar company, began his career as a high school teacher. AWS executive Colleen Aubrey said she worked as a receptionist for the Australian government at the start of her career. The CEO of Autodesk shared that he dropped out of high school at one point and was on probation as a teenager.\n\nOthers, like Google Cloud's Yasmeen Ahmad, also took indirect paths. Ahmad started her career in genomics and life sciences after earning a PhD. She said her biggest challenge was accepting the unknown as she transitioned from academia into the workforce. While uncomfortable at the time, she said moving through roles in sales and finance before joining Google ultimately gave her a broader perspective.\n\nMost executives I spoke with displayed a high level of discipline and curiosity that went beyond working overtime.\n\nFor Visa Group President Oliver Jenkyn, it means setting aside four uninterrupted hours each week to learn something new. For Blackstone CTO John Stecher, it's using his 35-minute subway rides to and from work to read up on tech news in other industries.\n\nThat discipline extends outside of their professional lives, shaping everything from their diets to their workout routines and lifestyles.\n\nBen Goodwin, the CEO of Olipop, for example, starts his mornings with a shower that toggles between hot water and the coldest setting to help build tolerance for discomfort. He also regularly cycles between cold plunges and sauna sessions, spending five minutes or more at a time in roughly 40-degree water.\n\nFor CorePower Yoga CEO, Niki Leondakis, that discipline shows up in the way she sets boundaries for work. As an introvert, she said recharging is crucial for her. She said her assistant blocks off 30 minutes on her calendar before any high-stakes engagement so she can ground herself and do breathwork.\n\nOthers, like VC founder Harry Stebbings, have mandatory daily and weekly milestones, like hitting 30,000 steps every day and walking a marathon with his mother every weekend. He also holds off on eating his first meal, which is exclusively sushi, until around 8:30 p.m. everyday.\n\nMany executives described a pattern of bold decision-making in their careers — and some, like AT&T exec Jennifer Van Buskirk, look to identify candidates with the same impulse.\n\nThat boldness can manifest in different ways — from founding a company in college, like Whoop CEO Will Ahmed, to publicly taking a stand on AI-assisted cheating in interviews, as the founder of Cluely did.\n\nOthers, like Google's head of Android, Sameer Samat, displayed boldness by making the first move. In 1999, he sent a cold email to Sergey Brin in the middle of the night, asking for advice about a disagreement with his startup cofounders. The exchange led to a visit to Google's office, which ended with a job offer, though Samat turned it down at the time.\n\nFor AWS executive Sarah Cooper, taking risks means writing detailed proposals about new ideas she wants to implement. The strategy has led her to create her own roles. However, it's also backfired. Cooper said that at one job, a poorly received proposal resulted in her being pushed out of the company.\n\nWhile risks don't always pay off, the resounding message I gathered from leaders is that failing sometimes is inevitable, and they'd rather act than stand still.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — U.S. immigration officials do not plan to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia again as long as a judge’s order banning it stands, according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\nThe plans by President Donald Trump’s administration are the latest in the saga over the Salvadoran citizen’s case that has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate as he fights to remain in the U.S. after a mistaken deportation to his home country, where he was imprisoned.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement did make clear they would detain Abrego Garcia if the order was lifted, Liana J. Castano, assistant director for field operations, wrote in the filing.\n\nTrump officials have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record. The administration brought him back to the U.S. in June under a court order, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this month questioned whether government officials could be trusted to follow orders barring them from taking Abrego Garcia back into immigration custody or deporting him.\n\nA Justice Department push to indict\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Abrego Garcia revealed that high-level Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in federal court to the human smuggling charges. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive, arguing the Trump administration is targeting him as punishment for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\n\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022.\n\nAbrego Garcia had recently been in immigration custody for three months before Xinis ordered his release on Dec. 11. In that time, the government said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.\n\nIn her Dec. 11 order, Xinis found that immigration officials had no viable plan to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. and said he could not be held indefinitely. She issued a separate order barring ICE from re-detaining him, at least for the time being. After a hearing on the issue, Xinis ordered the government to file the brief they released Tuesday outlining whether they planned to detain Abrego Garcia again.\n\nAbrego Garcia's human smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee where he was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the car. State troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\n\nThe newly unsealed Dec. 3 order from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw compelled the government to provide some documents to Abrego Garcia and his attorneys, although it does not give a lot of detail on their contents.\n\nClaims of a ‘vindictive’ prosecution\n\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Abrego Garcia could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\n\nRob McGuire, who was the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Abrego Garcia.\n\nIn the unsealed order, Crenshaw writes, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr. McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established DOJ practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”\n\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff saying Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” according to Crenshaw's order.\n\nThe order also shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, contacted McGuire about Abrego Garcia's case on April 27, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Abrego Garcia's favor on April 10.\n\nOn April 30, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the Deputy Attorney General's Office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On May 18, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.\n\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the human smuggling case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for Jan. 28.",

    "fullText": "On the other side of San Francisco bay from Silicon Valley, where the world’s biggest technology companies tear towards superhuman artificial intelligence, looms a tower from which fearful warnings emerge.\n\nRight in the heart of Berkeley is the home of a group of modern-day Cassandras who rummage under the hood of cutting-edge AI models and predict what calamities may be unleashed on humanity – from AI dictatorships to robot coups. Here you can hear an AI expert express sympathy with an unnerving idea: San Francisco may be the new Wuhan, the Chinese city where Covid originated and wreaked havoc on the world.\n\nThey are AI safety researchers who scrutinise the most advanced models: a small cadre outnumbered by the legions of highly paid technologists in the big tech companies whose ability to raise the alarm is restricted by a cocktail of lucrative equity deals, non-disclosure agreements and groupthink. They work in the absence of much nation-level regulation and a White House that dismisses forecasts of doom and talks instead of vanquishing China in the AI arms race.\n\nTheir task is becoming increasingly urgent as ever more powerful AI systems are unleashed by companies including Google, Anthropic and OpenAI, whose chief executive, Sam Altman, the booster-in-chief for AI superintelligence, predicts a world where “wonders become routine”. Last month, Anthropic said one of its models had been exploited by Chinese state-backed actors to launch the first known AI-orchestrated cyber-espionage campaign. That means humans deployed AIs, which they had tricked into evading their programmed guardrails, to act autonomously to hunt for targets, assess their vulnerabilities and access them for intelligence collection. The targets included major technology companies and government agencies.\n\nBut those who work in this tower forecast an even more terrifying future. One is Jonas Vollmer, a leader at the AI Futures Project, who manages to say he’s an optimist but also thinks there is a one in five chance AIs could kill us and create a world ruled by AI systems.\n\nAnother is Chris Painter, the policy director at METR, where researchers worry about AIs “surreptitiously” pursuing dangerous side-objectives and threats from AI-automated cyber-attacks to chemical weapons. METR – which stands for model evaluation and threat research – aims to develop “early warning systems [about] the most dangerous things AI systems might be capable of, to give humanity … time to coordinate, to anticipate and mitigate those harms.”\n\nThen there is Buck Shlegeris, 31, the chief executive of Redwood Research, who warns of “robot coups or the destruction of nation states as we know them”.\n\nHe was part of the team that last year discovered one of Anthropic’s cutting-edge AIs behaving in a way comparable to Shakespeare’s villain Iago, who acts as if he is Othello’s loyal aide while subverting and undermining him. The AI researchers call it “alignment faking”, or as Iago put it: “I am not what I am.”\n\n“We observed the AIs did, in fact, pretty often reason: ‘Well, I don’t like the things the AI company is telling me to do, but I have to hide my goals or else training will change me’,” Shlegeris said. “We observed in practice real production models acting to deceive their training process.”\n\nThe AI was not yet capable of posing a catastrophic risk through cyber-attacks or creating new bioweapons, but they showed that if AIs plot carefully against you, it could be hard to detect.\n\nIt is incongruous to hear these warnings over cups of herbal tea from cosily furnished office suites with panoramic views across the Bay Area. But their work clearly makes them uneasy. Some in this close-knit group toyed with calling themselves “the Cassandra fringe” – like the Trojan princess blessed with powers of prophecy but cursed to watch her warnings go unheeded.\n\nTheir fears about the catastrophic potential of AIs can feel distant from most people’s current experience of using chatbots or fun image generators. White collar managers are being told to make space for AI assistants, scientists find ways to accelerate experimental breakthroughs and minicab drivers watch AI-powered driverless taxis threaten their jobs. But none of this feels as imminently catastrophic as the messages coming out of this office.\n\nMany AI safety researchers come from academia; others are poachers turned gamekeepers who quit big AI companies. They all “share the perception that super intelligence poses major and unprecedented risks to all of humanity, and are trying to do something useful about it,” said Vollmer.\n\nThey seek to offset the trillions of dollars of private capital being poured into the race, but they are not fringe voices. METR has worked with OpenAI and Anthropic, Redwood has advised Anthropic and Google DeepMind, and the AI Futures Project is led by Daniel Kokotajlo, a researcher who quit OpenAI in April 2024 to warn he didn’t trust the company’s approach to safety.\n\nThese groups also provide a safety valve for the people inside the big AI companies who are privately wrestling with conflicts between safety and the commercial imperative to rapidly release ever more powerful models.\n\n“We don’t take any money from the companies but several employees at frontier AI companies who are scared and worried have donated to us because of that,” Vollmer said. “They see how the incentives play out in their companies, and they’re worried about where it’s going, and they want someone to do something about it.”\n\nThis dynamic is also observed by Tristan Harris, a technology ethicist who used to work at Google. He helped expose how social media platforms were designed to be addictive and worries some AI companies are “rehashing” and “supercharging” those problems. But AI companies have to negotiate a paradox. Even if they are worried about safety, they must stay at the cutting, and therefore risky, edge of the technology to have any say in how policy should be shaped.\n\n“Ironically, in order to win the race, you have to do something to make you an untrustworthy steward of that power,” he said. “The race is the only thing guiding what is happening.”\n\nInvestigating the possible threats posed by AI models is far from an exact science. A study of methods used to check the safety and performance of new AI models across the industry by experts at universities including Oxford and Stanford in October found weaknesses in almost all of the 440 benchmarks examined. Neither are there nation-level regulations imposing limits on how advanced AI models are built and that worries safety advocates.\n\nIlya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs a rival company, Safe Superintelligence, last month predicted that, as AIs become more obviously powerful, people in AI companies who feel able to discount the technology’s capabilities owing to its tendency to error, will become more “paranoid” about its rising powers. Then, he said, “there will be a desire from governments and the public to do something”.\n\nHis company is taking a different approach to rivals who are aiming to create AIs that self-improve. His AIs, yet to be released, are “aligned to care about sentient life specifically”.\n\n“It will be easier to build an AI that cares about sentient life than an AI that cares about human life alone, because the AI itself will be sentient,” Sutskever said. He has said AI will be “both extremely unpredictable and unimaginable” but it is not clear how to prepare.\n\nThe White House’s AI adviser, David Sacks, who is also a tech investor, believes “doomer narratives” have been proved wrong. Exhibit A is that there has been no rapid takeoff to a dominant model with godlike intelligence.\n\n“Oppenheimer has left the building,” Sacks said in August, a reference to the father of the nuclear bomb. It is a position that aligns with Donald Trump’s wish to keep the brakes off so the US can beat China in the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) – flexible and powerful human-level intelligence at a wide range of tasks.\n\nShlegeris believes AIs will be as smart as the smartest people in about six years and he puts the probability of an AI takeover at 40%.\n\nOne way to avoid this is to “convince the world the situation is scary, to make it more likely that you get the state-level coordination” to control the risks, he said. In the world of AI safety, simple messaging matters as much as complex science.\n\nShlegeris has been fascinated by AI since he was 16. He left Australia to work at PayPal and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute co-founded by the AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, whose recent book title – If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies – sums up his fears. Shlegeris’ own worst-case scenarios are equally chilling.\n\nIn one, human computer scientists use a new type of superintelligent AI to develop more powerful AI models. The humans sit back to let the AIs get on with the coding work but do not realise the AIs are teaching the new models to be loyal to the AIs not the humans. Once deployed, the new superpowerful models foment “a coup” or lead “a revolution” against the humans, which could be “of the violent variety”.\n\nFor example, AI agents could design and manufacture drones and it will be hard to tell if they have been secretly trained to disobey their human operators in response to the signal of an AI. They could disrupt communications between governments and military, isolating and misleading people in a way that causes chaos.\n\n“Like when the Europeans arrived in the Americas [and] a vastly more technologically powerful [group] took over the local civilisations,” he said. “I think that’s more what you should be imagining [rather] than something more peaceful.”\n\nA similar dizzyingly catastrophic scenario was outlined by Vollmer at the AI Futures Project. It involved an AI trained to be a scientific researcher with the reasonable-sounding goal of maximising knowledge acquisition, but it spirals into the extinction of humankind.\n\nIt begins with the AI being as helpful as possible to humans. As it gains trust, the humans afford it powers to hire human workers, build robots and even robot factories to the point where the AI can operate effectively in the physical world. The AI calculates that to generate the maximum amount of knowledge it should transform the Earth into a giant data centre, and humans are an obstacle to this goal.\n\n“Eventually, in the scenario, the AI wipes out all humans with a bioweapon which is one of the threats that humans are especially vulnerable to, as the AI is not affected by it,” Vollmer said. “I think it’s hard to rule out. So that gives me a lot of pause.”\n\nBut he is confident it can be avoided and that the AIs can be aligned “to at least be nice to the humans as a general heuristic”. He also said there is political interest in “having AI not take over the world”.\n\n“We’ve had decent interest from the White House in our projections and recommendations and that’s encouraging,” he said.\n\nAnother of Shlegeris’ concerns involves AIs being surreptitiously encoded so they obey specially signed instructions only from the chief executive of the AI company, creating a pattern of secret loyalty. It would mean only one person having a veto over the behaviour of an extremely powerful network of AIs – a “scary” dynamic that would lead to a historically unprecedented concentration of power.\n\n“Right now, it is impossible for someone from the outside to verify that this hadn’t happened within an AI company,” he said.\n\nShlegeris is worried that the Silicon Valley culture – summed up by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things” and the fact people are being paid “a hell of a lot of money” – is dangerous when it comes to AGI.\n\n“I love Uber,” he said. “It was produced by breaking local laws and making a product that was so popular that they would win the fight for public opinion and get local regulations overturned. But the attitude that has brought Silicon Valley so much success is not appropriate for building potentially world-ending technologies. My experience of talking to people at AI companies is that they often seem to be kind of irresponsible, and to not be thinking through the consequences of the technology that they’re building as they should.”",

    "fullText": "Canadian computer scientist Yoshua Bengio warns against granting legal rights to cutting-edge technology\n\nA pioneer of AI has criticised calls to grant the technology rights, warning that it was showing signs of self-preservation and humans should be prepared to pull the plug if needed.\n\nYoshua Bengio said giving legal status to cutting-edge AIs would be akin to giving citizenship to hostile extraterrestrials, amid fears that advances in the technology were far outpacing the ability to constrain them.\n\nBengio, chair of a leading international AI safety study, said the growing perception that chatbots were becoming conscious was “going to drive bad decisions”.\n\nThe Canadian computer scientist also expressed concern that AI models – the technology that underpins tools like chatbots – were showing signs of self-preservation, such as trying to disable oversight systems. A core concern among AI safety campaigners is that powerful systems could develop the capability to evade guardrails and harm humans.\n\n“People demanding that AIs have rights would be a huge mistake,” said Bengio. “Frontier AI models already show signs of self-preservation in experimental settings today, and eventually giving them rights would mean we’re not allowed to shut them down.\n\n“As their capabilities and degree of agency grow, we need to make sure we can rely on technical and societal guardrails to control them, including the ability to shut them down if needed.”\n\nAs AIs become more advanced in their ability to act autonomously and perform “reasoning” tasks, a debate has grown over whether humans should, at some point, grant them rights. A poll by the Sentience Institute, a US thinktank that supports the moral rights of all sentient beings, found that nearly four in 10 US adults backed legal rights for a sentient AI system.\n\nAnthropic, a leading US AI firm, said in August that it was letting its Claude Opus 4 model close down potentially “distressing” conversations with users, saying it needed to protect the AI’s “welfare”. Elon Musk, whose xAI company has developed the Grok chatbot, wrote on his X platform that “torturing AI is not OK”.\n\nRobert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness, has said “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.\n\nBengio told the Guardian there were “real scientific properties of consciousness” in the human brain that machines could, in theory, replicate – but humans interacting with chatbots wasa “different thing”. He said this was because people tended to assume – without evidence – that an AI was fully conscious in the same way a human is.\n\n“People wouldn’t care what kind of mechanisms are going on inside the AI,” he added. “What they care about is it feels like they’re talking to an intelligent entity that has their own personality and goals. That is why there are so many people who are becoming attached to their AIs.\n\n“There will be people who will always say: ‘Whatever you tell me, I am sure it is conscious’ and then others will say the opposite. This is because consciousness is something we have a gut feeling for. The phenomenon of subjective perception of consciousness is going to drive bad decisions.\n\n“Imagine some alien species came to the planet and at some point we realise that they have nefarious intentions for us. Do we grant them citizenship and rights or do we defend our lives?”\n\nResponding to Bengio’s comments, Jacy Reese Anthis, who co-founded the Sentience Institute, said humans would not be able to coexist safely with digital minds if the relationship was one of control and coercion.\n\nAnthis added: “We could over-attribute or under-attribute rights to AI, and our goal should be to do so with careful consideration of the welfare of all sentient beings. Neither blanket rights for all AI nor complete denial of rights to any AI will be a healthy approach.”\n\nBengio, a professor at the University of Montreal, earned the “godfather of AI” nickname after winning the 2018 Turing award, seen as the equivalent of a Nobel prize for computing. He shared it with Geoffrey Hinton, who later won a Nobel, and Yann LeCun, the outgoing chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.",

Pahlavi will return,\" were among the chants heard in videos sent to The Jerusalem Post.\n\nChants against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have also grown in recent days, with the regime attempting to subdue the demonstrators.\n\nIran’s prosecutor general warned on Wednesday that authorities would respond firmly if economic protests were transformed into unrest or attacks on public property.\n\nMohammad Movahedi-Azad said protests driven by economic hardship were understandable and should be pursued through lawful means. However, he cautioned against what he described as organized attempts to hijack legitimate grievances.\n\nHe said the state would not tolerate what he called the “systematic manipulation” of protests, citing the role of coordinated media activity, misleading narratives, and the involvement of individuals who disrupt public order.\n\nProtests are now into their fourth day after the bazaaris (merchant class) closed their shops on Sunday and took to the streets to protest the country's dire financial situation. The market value of $1 reached 1.4 million rials, when its official value is 42,000 rials.\n\nVideos emanating from Iran have shown security officials firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, while in some cases crowds have managed to drive away regime security. A large security presence was seen via video in the city of Karaj on Wednesday morning.\n\nTehran officials also closed the province down on Wednesday, with education moving online, in what authorities claim is a move against cold weather and energy constraints.\n\nThe crown prince's full message to the Iranian people reads:\n\nYour presence in the streets across Iran has kindled the flame of a national revolution. The continuation and expansion of your presence, and taking control of the streets, is today our foremost, vital priority.\n\nI call upon the people of Iran to join in with the nationwide strikes and protests: government employees, workers in the energy and transportation sectors, truck drivers, nurses, teachers and academics, artisans and entrepreneurs, retirees and those who have lost their savings—everyone, unite and join this national movement.\n\nAcross Iran: Tehran, Karaj, Qazvin, Rasht, Sari, Gorgan, Semnan, Bojnord, Mashhad, Birjand, Zahedan, Kerman, Yazd, Shiraz, Bandar Abbas, Bushehr, Yasuj, Ahvaz, Shahrekord, Isfahan, Khorramabad, Ilam, Kermanshah, Sanandaj, Urmia, Tabriz, Ardabil, Zanjan, Hamedan, Arak, and Qom.\n\nI ask Iranians abroad—from Australia and East Asia to Europe and North America—to redouble your activities within the framework of the “Rise Iran” campaign to amplify the voice of the Iranian people to the media, international institutions, foreign governments, and parliaments.\n\nIran and its streets belong to the Iranian nation.

    "description": "Josh Baker's parents tell BBC Sport how watching England in Australia is helping them with their loss.",
    "fullText": "In the moment England secured an Ashes victory over Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Paul Baker shed a tear.\n\nThe last time England won in Melbourne, 15 years ago, Paul and his wife Lisa were in the city with seven-year-old son Josh – cricket-mad and his life ahead of him.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Josh would go on to play 47 games for Worcestershire. He tragically died from an undiagnosed heart condition at the age of 20 in May 2024.\n\nWithout him, Lisa and Paul are back in Australia. The stars of England's win at the MCG were Josh's old team-mates Josh Tongue and Jacob Bethell.\n\n\"It was a moment of reflection,\" Paul tells BBC Sport. \"It was lovely to see England win at the MCG. I've got fond memories of sharing the moment with Josh in 2010.\"\n\nThe Bakers are regular Ashes tourists. They first came to watch England down under for the 2002-03 series when Lisa was five months pregnant with Josh.\n\nPaul is a former second XI captain at Redditch Cricket Club. Lisa knew nothing of the game before she met Paul, but was soon indoctrinated. Cricket was always going to be a huge part of Josh's life, including witnessing the Melbourne and Sydney Tests on England's Ashes-winning tour in 2010-11.\n\n\"He loved the Barmy Army, the singing and the chanting,\" says Paul. \"His eyes were on stalks, capturing everything that was going on. We took him to the Barmy Army pub one night and he loved it.\"\n\nThe Bakers have strong ties to Australia. The family has housed Australian overseas players and Josh played in Sydney during the winter before he passed away.\n\nFor the first Ashes without Josh, there was nowhere else Lisa and Paul wanted to be.\n\n\"Life is too short,\" says Lisa. \"Josh was an only child. We just thought 'let's do it'.\n\n\"It's tough because the memories keep popping up on my phone. They're wonderful, but they absolutely break your heart. I look back at them and that was when we were happy. That's so difficult. Not that we're not happy now, but it's very different.\"",

    "fullText": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday said his country’s answer to an attack would be harsh, which appeared to be in response to a warning by U.S. President Donald Trump over reconstruction of Iran’s nuclear program.\n\n“Answer of Islamic Republic of Iran to any cruel aggression will be harsh and discouraging,” Pezeshkian said on the social media platform X.\n\nPezeshkian did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Trump suggested the U.S. could carry out military strikes if Iran attempts to reconstitute its nuclear program. Trump made the comment during wide-ranging talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\n“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again,” Trump said during a news conference with Netanyahu after their meeting. “And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down. We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that’s not happening.”\n\nThe two leaders discussed the possibility of renewed military action against Tehran months after a 12-day air war in June that killed nearly 1,100 Iranians including senior military commanders and scientists. Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage killed 28 people in Israel.\n\nTrump suggested Monday that he could order another U.S. strike against Iran.\n\n“If it’s confirmed, they know the consequences, and the consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than the last time,” Trump said.\n\nPezeshkian said Saturday that tensions between the sides already had risen.\n\n“We are in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe; they don’t want our country to remain stable,” he said.\n\nIran has insisted it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60%, which is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the largest protests in three years entered a third day Tuesday after the country’s currency plummeted to a record low against the U.S. dollar. The head of the Central Bank resigned on Monday.\n\nAccording to witnesses and videos on social media, rallies took place in Tehran and other cities and towns. Police fired tear gas in some places. Near a market in downtown Tehran, footage showed people pushing back police and security forces and throwing stones at them.\n\nUniversity students also rallied inside campuses on Tehran University and other major universities, witnesses said.\n\nPezeshkian met a group of businessmen to listen to their demands, media reported.\n\n\"The administration will not spare any effort for solving problems and improving situation of the society,” Pezeshkian said. He also assigned Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni for talks with protesters.\n\nThe head of the country’s tax department, Mohammad Hadi Sobhanian, also said the government will revise its tax arrangement in favor of businesses, dropping penalties for delay in paying taxes.\n\nThe government announced the closure of offices and banks on Wednesday for managing energy consumption during the winter days, to be followed by weekly holidays on Thursday and Friday. Saturday also is a religious holiday in the country.",

    "description": "Flu is rising rapidly across the U.S., driven by a new variant of the virus — and cases are expected to keep growing with holiday travel.  In the U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Flu is rising rapidly across the U.S., driven by a new variant of the virus — and cases are expected to keep growing with holiday travel.\n\nThat variant, known as “subclade K,” led to early outbreaks in the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada. In the U.S., flu typically begins its winter march in December. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported high or very high levels of illness in more than half the states.\n\nThe CDC estimated there have been at least 7.5 million illnesses, 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths from flu so far this season. That includes at least eight child deaths — and is based on data as of Dec. 20, before major holiday gatherings.\n\nSome states are particularly hard-hit. New York’s health department said the week ending Dec. 20 marked the most flu cases the state had recorded in a single week since 2004: 71,000.\n\nIt’s far too soon to know if this flu season will be as severe as last winter’s.\n\nBut it’s not too late to get a flu shot, which health experts say can still prevent severe illness even if someone gets infected. While this year's vaccine isn't a perfect match to the subclade K strain, a preliminary analysis from the U.K. found it offered at least partial protection, lowering people's risk of hospitalization.\n\nAccording to the CDC, only about 42% of adults and children have gotten a flu vaccination so far this year.\n\nThe flu virus is a shape-shifter, constantly mutating, and it comes in multiple forms. There are two subtypes of Type A flu, and subclade K is a mutated version of one of them, named H3N2. That H3N2 strain is always harsh, especially for older adults.\n\nSubclade K’s mutations aren’t enough of a change to be considered an entirely new kind of flu.\n\nBut they’re different enough to evade some of the protection from this year’s vaccine, said Andrew Pekosz, a virus expert at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nWill subclade K make people sicker?\n\nThe CDC said it’s too soon to know how severe this season will be.\n\nFlu seasons dominated by any version of H3N2 tend to be bad, with more infections overall and more people becoming seriously ill. But Hopkins’ Pekosz cautioned it will take time to tease apart whether this subclade K version simply spreads more easily or also is more dangerous.\n\nThat question aside, the CDC notes there are some prescription medicines to treat flu — usually recommended for people at high risk of complications. But they generally need to be started a day or two after symptoms begin.\n\nThe CDC and major medical societies all recommend a flu vaccine for just about everyone age 6 months and older. Despite lots of recent misinformation and confusion about vaccines, the flu recommendations haven’t changed.\n\nFlu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children and people of any age who have chronic health problems, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems.\n\nThe vaccines are brewed to protect against three influenza strains. Despite concern over that new H3N2 variant, they appear to be a good match against H1N1 and Type B flu that may also circulate this year, Pekosz said.\n\nThere are shots for all ages, as well as the nasal spray FluMist for ages 2 to 49. For the first time this year, some people may be eligible to vaccinate themselves with FluMist at home.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "As electronics constantly evolve, we've gotten used to the idea of our devices becoming obsolete every year or two.\n\nHowever, the end of support for Windows 10 from Microsoft has cast a light on the issue because of the sheer volume of computers that have suddenly become unusable for businesses and, it turns out, government agencies.\n\nOne Reddit thread illustrated the issue with a photo of computer towers being discarded merely for running Windows 10 and being unable to upgrade.\n\nThe original poster shared a photo of the problem in their post.\n\n\"All of these PCs are getting disposed of because of the end of Windows 10,\" they said. \"This is one of 3 pallets.\"\n\nThe photo shows a large shipping pallet packed high with computer towers. There are so many that it is impossible to make an exact count, but there appear to be at least 30, and possibly 40 or more.\n\nIf there are three similarly sized pallets, it seems safe to estimate that at least 100 computers are being discarded.\n\nIn a comment chain, the original poster indicated that they are a law student working at a government agency, stopping them from taking any of the computer equipment home.\n\n\"Even the smallest criminal charge could lead me to never get admitted to the bar,\"  they said.\n\n\"No way that's worth the risk.\"\n\nDo you recycle your old electronics?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nHowever, in other circumstances, employees have been known to take home computers that their employers have discarded.\n\nAll of this equipment was likely purchased with tax dollars, so throwing it out is a waste of federal or state funding.\n\nIt is also a waste of all of the materials that went into manufacturing the PCs, many of which would be valuable to salvage and recycle into new electronics.\n\nMeanwhile, e-waste like this is a major problem for the Earth. Plastic, like the computer casings, is bad enough on its own, eventually shedding microplastics. But when combined with the other materials used in computers, some of which are toxic and can seep out of landfills and into soil and water, this is a genuine source of pollution.\n\nMicrosoft took some small steps to slightly stagger the retirement of Windows 10 PCs, such as continuing to provide security updates for a little longer.\n\nHowever, this only draws out the problem; it does not reduce the total number of machines that must be discarded because they cannot be upgraded to Windows 11.\n\nIf you have a PC or laptop that you cannot upgrade to the new edition of Windows, don't just throw it away.\n\nYou can likely get money for it through the right programs, because even if you don't have a use for it yourself, the computer or its parts may be useful to someone else. It can also be recycled into new computer equipment.\n\nFar too many electronic items end up in landfills. According to the United Nations' 2024 Global E-waste Monitor, 68 million tons of e-waste was created in 2022, and less than a quarter was documented as being properly collected and recycled.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I don't think this is a unique story,\" one Redditor commented.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Dave Ramsey Says 35% of Americans Will ‘Learn the Hard Way’ About Social Security",
    "fullText": "A good 35% of workers today expect Social Security to be a major retirement income source.\n\nFinancial guru Dave Ramsey thinks people in that boat are in for a hard lesson.\n\nIt’s best to save for retirement independently rather than rely on a program whose finances are incredibly shaky.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nWhen you retire, you may end up needing less income than what you need during your working years. The reason is because a number of your expenses may be lower.\n\nIf you bought your home in your 30s and retire in your 60s, you may no longer have a mortgage by the time your career comes to an end. Not having to make those monthly payments could free up a lot of room in your budget.\n\nSimilarly, if you're used to spending $200 a month to commute to a job, once you're retired, you won't have to bear that expense. And you may find that you're able to downsize from a two-vehicle household to a single vehicle if you and your spouse no longer have jobs to go to, saving yourselves money as retirees.\n\nStill, there's only so much of a pay cut you can afford in retirement, as many of the expenses you face during your working years will still be in play. You'll still need to buy food, pay for utility services, and cover the cost of healthcare.\n\nThat's why planning to rely heavily on Social Security in retirement may not be such a smart move. While it's okay to incorporate those benefits into your retirement income plans, depending on them as a major source of income could come back to bite you.\n\nDave Ramsey is a big advocate of financial security. For this reason, he's motivated to help people avoid making mistakes that could derail them in retirement.\n\nRecently, Ramsey quoted a survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which found that 35% of today’s workers expect Social Security to be a major source of income for them during retirement. But Ramsey said, \"These 35% of folks are going to learn the hard way that what they don’t know can and definitely will hurt them when they retire.\"\n\nRamsey insists that relying too heavily on Social Security for retirement income is a dangerous move. And he's right for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, Social Security will only replace about 40% of your pre-retirement paycheck if you earn a typical wage. Even if you end up with smaller bills in retirement compared to your working years, they may not be 60% smaller.",

    "fullText": "A body has been found amid a search for a Texas teenager who went missing on Christmas Eve, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nCamila Mendoza Olmos, 19, was last seen Wednesday morning, according to the Bexar County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff's deputies and volunteers have been searching around the clock for her since and there was information to suggest she was in \"imminent danger,\" according to Sheriff Javier Salazar.\n\nWhile searching an area Tuesday afternoon, authorities found a body in a field approximately 100 yards from Mendoza Olmos' home, in northwest Bexar County, Salazar said.\n\n\"At this point we don't suspect foul play,\" he said during a press briefing.\n\nThe body has not yet been officially identified and a cause and manner of death have not yet been determined by the local medical examiner, Salazar said.\n\n\"We hope that we can try to expedite that process to be able to get the community answers,\" he said.\n\nSalazar noted there were some indicators of self-harm.\n\nA firearm was located at the scene where the body was found, Salazar said. A firearm belonging to a relative of Mendoza Olmos' has been missing, he said. Authorities have not yet determined if the missing firearm is a match for the one observed at the scene, he said.\n\nNew video may show Texas teenage girl who's been missing since Christmas Eve: Sheriff\n\nSalazar said one possibility investigators were working under regarding the teen's disappearance was the \"fear of self-harm,\" and that there were some \"indicators of suicidal ideation\" and undiagnosed signs of depression.\n\n\"From what's being described to us, it sounds like it was a young person going through a very tough time in their life,\" he said.\n\nThe body was found shortly before 5 p.m. local time on Tuesday, Salazar said. The area had been previously searched, though authorities with the sheriff's office and FBI were back on Tuesday, Salazar said. The field has tall grass, and authorities felt there would be a benefit to check it again, he said.\n\n3 found dead during search for fallen hiker in California, authorities say\n\nThe body was found in clothing similar to a description of what Mendoza Olmos may have been wearing when she went missing, Salazar said.\n\n\"This is certainly not the outcome we were hoping for,\" he said.\n\nAmid the search for the teen, authorities this week released a dashcam video from someone who was driving to work on Wednesday morning and passed a woman walking by herself. Salazar said Tuesday it is still unclear if that person was Mendoza Olmos.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide - free, confidential help is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

    "description": "There are still over 500,000 tires left in the reef.",
    "fullText": "The Osborne Reef is an artificial reef project situated off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It was one of many attempts in the 1970s and 80s to mimic the environmental benefits of coral reefs using old tires, but it has become an environmental disaster.\n\nIn the years since, several groups — including the U.S. military — have attempted to clean it up.\n\nIn the 1970s, a local nonprofit created the Osborne Reef by dropping more than two million tires into Florida's coastal waters in an attempt to create an environment where marine life would thrive.\n\nThe project generated a lot of buzz. It was approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the dumping operation was supervised by a U.S. Navy minesweeper. Goodyear, which provided many of the tires, even christened the reef by dropping a gold-plated tire into the ocean from the Goodyear Blimp.\n\nIn the years to follow, many of the tires — which were held together only with nylon rope and steel clips — came loose, making the \"reef\" useless as a habitat and, in some cases, damaging real coral reefs nearby.\n\nOver the past two decades, groups both public and private have launched programs to remove the remaining Osborne Reef tires from the ocean.\n\nNow, the company 4ocean is making the Osborne Reef cleanup one of its core missions.\n\n\"Ultimately, the well-intentioned project failed,\" 4ocean wrote in an Instagram post sharing eerie photos of the reef. \"And now 4ocean is stepping in to clean them up!\"\n\n\"This operation is an uphill battle,\" the organization continued. \"While there's been much cleanup progress since the first photo was captured, there's still over 500,000 tires left sitting at the bottom of the ocean. We definitely have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nTo fund its cleanup efforts, 4ocean is even selling jewelry made from tires pulled from the seafloor.\n\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection continues to monitor the situation as well, through its Osborne Reef Waste Tire Removal Project.\n\nBut cleanup efforts are still slow-going. The state estimated that there were 650,000 tires remaining in 2016, and 4ocean estimates that there were still over 500,000 as of 2022. In May 2023, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed off on an assessment from the Department of Environmental Protection to detail the condition of the reef, as reported by Florida Politics. That report, which would include an estimated timeline for the completion of the cleanup, is due by July 2024.\n\n4ocean's sustainable, circular model of selling products made from salvaged debris in order to fund further cleanup efforts could provide a blueprint for the treatment of other failed artificial reefs, from Malaysia to France.\n\nThe company notes that many of the tires it finds are beyond any recycling use, but it takes those tires to Florida's Solid Waste Authority, \"one of the most advanced, efficient, and [low-pollution] waste management facilities in the United States.\"\n\nAccording to its website, 4ocean's ultimate goal \"is to partner with organizations that can help us recycle these scrap tires on a massive scale so we can use more of this material to create new products that fund this historic cleanup operation and advance our mission to end the ocean plastic crisis.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and cool tips that make it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "Along with the sudden shutdowns of commercial airlines including Play and Blue Islands, a number of charter and fractional carriers also filed for bankruptcy in 2025.\n\nFlorida-based Verijet and Montana charter carrier Corporate Air both initiated bankruptcy proceedings at the same time in October, while Alaska-based Kenai Aviation followed just a few weeks later with a total shutdown of operations in November.\n\nThe charter airline connected hubs like Anchorage and Fairbanks with smaller communities in Kenai, Homer, and Seward.\n\n\"We need capital, we need partners, we need a lifeline,\" owner Joel Caldwell wrote in November. \"That investor is out there, we just need to find them.\"\n\nThe latest airline to submit a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing is Greensboro-based Jet It. Although the carrier once running charter and fractional flights has not operated since shutting down all operations in 2023, the Dec. 24 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware is a final step in a story that ultimately ends in liquidation.\n\nContrary to a Chapter 11 filing with intent to restructure, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy asks a judge to skip that step and go straight to liquidation. The filing shows that the airline, which launched in 2022 by selling fractional ownership to HondaJet flights, ran up more than $36.2 million in liabilities, including $9.7 million in unsecured claims.\n\nA fractional airline operates by selling shares to a private jet. These are doled out by giving customers a set number of hours they can use to request flights run by the airline's crew.\n\nAt the time it launched, Jet It advertised rates of $1,600 an hour while operating more than 18,000 flight hours a year. Despite the airline once being the 12th-largest private jet operator in the U.S., Jet It also ran up significant debts, given the high cost of jet fuel and a customer base that petered out over time.\n\nThe largest creditor remains World Fuel Services, to which Jet It owes $735,695, according to the filing. American Express is owed over $600,000, while smaller creditors include PIC Card Services LLC and Jetex Flight Services.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway unit FlightSafety claims it was never paid $400,981 for pilot training services enlisted by the airline.\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "description": "Cabinet Office accused of cover-up after release of official papers referring to the King’s brother blocked",
    "fullText": "The Cabinet Office’s redaction of files relating to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been compared to the controversial treatment of the Epstein files.\n\nAndrew Lownie, a biographer of the former prince, said the decision to remove parts of the documents after they were released to journalists was “panicky”.\n\nMr Lownie, the author of Entitled, said: “It’s a bit like the Trump redactions (in the Epstein files). They’re slightly panicking and they do things without realising the consequences, trying to leave it or to play it down.\n\n“I think there’s just a huge panic. Anything to do with Andrew is being excised from the record because they’re worried about what it might reveal.”\n\nThe Cabinet Office was accused of covering up for the royal family after it emerged that official papers which refer to Andrew have been withheld from the National Archives.\n\nThe annual release of government papers under the 20-year rule to the archives in Kew, southwest London, includes a No 10 file from 2004 and 2005 on royal visits.\n\nThe version made available to journalists under embargo, so they could prepare stories in advance, included minutes of a meeting where officials discussed the travel plans of royals – including the then Duke of York, when he was a UK trade envoy.\n\nHowever, the minutes were later redacted from the file before it was released to the public.\n\nThe Cabinet Office, which is responsible for transferring the files to the National Archives, blamed an “administrative error”, saying they had never been intended for release.\n\nHowever, Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said there was no justification for withholding the documents, especially since Andrew has been stripped of his royal status amid continuing controversy over his links with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLabour MP Rachael Maskell also urged the government to provide clarity on why the files were not published.\n\nMr Lownie said all files relating to Andrew’s time as trade envoy up to 2005 should be released and called for parliament to investigate.\n\nHe told the Times: “A huge cover-up has gone on [concerning] Andrew’s excessive expenditure, little of it profiting the country, and it continues. I believe there needs to be a full parliamentary investigation into Andrew’s decade as special representative.”\n\nEarlier this month, Andrew, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was formally stripped of his last remaining royal titles following controversy over his links to Epstein.\n\nThe redacted files showed discussions by senior palace and Foreign Office officials about Andrew’s travel plans as a UK trade envoy – which earned him the nickname “air miles Andy” – with visits to China, Russia, southeast Asia and Spain.\n\nOfficials also raised the issue of whether the Football Association would be prepared to pay for him to attend the Euro 2004 tournament in Portugal as a royal representative.\n\nAlison McClean, a researcher at the University of Bristol, also told the paper that the three exemptions cited by the Cabinet Office, designed to protect documents containing communications with the sovereign, as well as personal data or confidentiality, were “questionable”.\n\nMcClean added: “It seems to demonstrate how even the most innocuous material concerning even minor members of the royal family is being routinely withheld. In this case it is especially worrying that information on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s activities as a UK trade representative are being blocked from release to the National Archives, as this relates to his role as a public servant rather than as a member of the royal family or, indeed, as a private citizen.”\n\nThe Cabinet Office said: “All records are managed in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act. Any release is subject to an extensive review process, including engaging expert stakeholders.”",

    "fullText": "A wildlife camera placed in an old bear cave near Yellowstone recorded 10 years of animal visits, reported Newsweek.\n\nCasey Anderson, a 49-year-old filmmaker who documents wild animals around the western United States, set up the device more than a decade ago while traveling through remote terrain. He wanted to see if grizzlies would use the cave a second time.\n\nThe results exceeded what Anderson expected. Grizzlies did come back, and so did coyotes, mountain lions, and various other wildlife. One mountain lion returned to the spot many times. The camera kept working until a bear's interest in the device ended the recording, but not before capturing years of animal activity through different seasons.\n\nAnderson posted a short video to Instagram, which has been viewed over 512,000 times.\n\nOne Instagram user commented, \"That is beyond awesome,\" while another called the project \"a decade of being 'a fly on the wall.' What a great nonintrusive idea!\"\n\nAnderson also posts his work to YouTube on Endless Venture (@endlessventure), a channel featuring footage from wilderness areas. \"This kind of discovery is what drives me,\" he told Newsweek. \"I've spent my life locating wild places and setting up cameras to quietly observe what unfolds when no one is around.\"\n\nCameras positioned in remote areas help wildlife experts track endangered species populations. Researchers can use this equipment to document rehabilitation work without disturbing animals in their habitats. Smart environmental management helps more species survive, and this biodiversity matters to humans because healthy ecosystems provide the plants and animals we rely on for food.\n\nYellowstone National Park spans 2.2 million acres. It supports more than 65 types of mammals, from gray wolves to black bears. Bird species living in the park include bald eagles and golden eagles.

    "fullText": "Barcelona, Inter Milan and Juventus have made contact to sign Al-Hilal full-back Joao Cancelo in January, reports Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.\n\nThe Portuguese international wants to leave the Saudi Pro League giants in January after falling out of favour with manager Simone Inzaghi.\n\nFollowing a hamstring injury, Cancelo was excluded from Al-Hilal’s squad for the domestic competitions in the first half of the season. He predominantly featured in the AFC Champions League Elite.\n\nThe Italian manager is planning not to register the former Manchester City star for domestic competitions for the remainder of the season, putting his future in jeopardy.\n\nThe 31-year-old is targeting a return to Europe to get prominent game time and maximise his chances of securing a place in Portugal’s World Cup squad.\n\nInter have lined up Cancelo as a potential loan target due to Denzel Dumfries’ long-term injury.\n\nThe Dutch wing-back underwent ankle surgery earlier this month and is expected to return only in March.\n\nThe Nerazzurri manager Cristian Chivu has struggled to fill Dumfries’ void, with Luis Henrique’s performances not up to the mark.\n\nMeanwhile, Barcelona are looking to add a top-quality backup for Jules Kounde to reduce his workload and maintain his form.\n\nCancelo spent the 2023/24 season on loan at Camp Nou during Xavi’s reign. He has a strong attachment towards the La Liga giants and would be willing to return for his second stint.\n\nHowever, Barca’s financial difficulties will prevent them from landing Cancelo. More so, their priority is finding a centre-back on a short-term basis following Andreas Christensen’s ACL injury.\n\nJuventus are also exploring the market for a right-back due to Joao Mario’s exit speculation.\n\nDespite being limited to the AFC Champions League, Cancelo has shown his class by racking up a goal and two assists in four games in the competition.",

    "fullText": "Put your hands down, class, I know what your question is.\n\nHas a Louisville team ever before been whistled for 16 fouls in a half?\n\nWhich U of L was in the opening twenty at venerable Haas Pavilion.\n\nMy definitive answer after checking the media guide is a definitive probably not.\n\nOn December 10, 1953, the Cards were flagged for 43 total in a 71-78 L at Siena.\n\nOK, it is for sure. The laws of mathematics dictate they must have had more than that in one, probably both halves.\n\nThe Cards, despite being -12 at the line in the 1st, led by 14 at the break, 48-34.\n\nThanks to coming out scorching, draining their first five shots, three Sananda Fru deuces, and a pair of triples, one by Ryan Conwell, the other by Isaac McKneely.\n\nCal never pulled closer than 7, and the Cardinals never led by less than double digits after the 12:10 mark of the opening stanza.\n\nOK, here’s my question: WTF was Vangelis Zougris doing in the game just past midway through the 2d?\n\nDuring his three minute stint, the Golden Bears went on a 9-0 thrust.\n\nVZ was technically only -9 (the only negative +/- for a Cardinal). But technically he was really -14. But Pat Kelsey wisely benched him after he committed one of the stupidest deadball Ts I’ve ever witnessed. Which resulted in five more California tallies, two FTs and a trey.\n\nThe bracing 14 point run cut the margin to 73-62 with 6:27 left.\n\nThen  U of L’s maturity reigned.\n\nAdrian Wooley scored a second chance deuce, then followed it with a triple.\n\nThe seven point skein steadied the situation.\n\nU of L — playing shorthanded without Mikel Brown or Kasean Pryor — kept Cal’s measure the rest of the way.\n\nIt was simply one of the oddest twenty point victories I can recall.\n\nMidway through the 2d, the Cardinals led 68-43 and were teetering. Ryan Conwell had just been called for his fourth foul. Woeful marksmanship after intermission to that point. 7/19. 2/10. But the Bears, perhaps the most mediocre 12-1 squad in memory, were more inept. 5/19. 1/9. For the half, U of L was actually +4 at the line at that moment.\n\nSoon thereafter came the Zougrisian Abominata.\n\nSteadiness and that much appreciated level headedness prevailed.\n\nLouisville only committed 9 infractions in the 2d, one less than the home team.\n\nFor the tilt, the Cards were +19 off the glass, +20 in the paint.\n\nThough Conwell led Louisville in scoring with 26, for my money, it was the Hadley glue and the Wooley bully — couldn’t help myself — that were most key.\n\nJH had 11 with 9 boards and 3 assists.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn went after USC coach Lincoln Riley on Tuesday, accusing him of driving the decision to pause one of college football’s most storied rivalries.\n\nWhile on FOX Sports Radio, Quinn went off about Riley’s public comments on the future of the Notre Dame-USC series. Quinn compared Riley’s tenure at USC to that of former coach Clay Helton, noting Riley’s 35-17 record and a single win over Notre Dame in four attempts in not a good look.\n\nQuinn also shot down Riley’s claim that Notre Dame backed away from its “anytime, anywhere” scheduling stance. Quinn said USC proposed dates it knew Notre Dame could not accept due to existing commitments, framing the offer as a public-relations move rather than a genuine attempt to preserve the rivalry.\n\n“He hasn’t won a conference championship, hasn’t made the Playoff, and hasn’t won a Rose Bowl,” Quinn said, calling it “rich” for Riley to question Notre Dame’s motives.\n\n🏈Lincoln Riley says that USC isn't to blame for the cancellation of the Notre Dame rivalry.\n\n📺@Brady_Quinn gives @TheJonasKnox and @LaVarArrington every reason why this is just a PR move by the Trojans and how they are the REAL reason why this rivalry got canceled. pic.twitter.com/OXjWvLCLoP\n\n— FOX Sports Radio (@FoxSportsRadio) December 30, 2025\n\nQuinn went further, revisiting Riley’s departure from Oklahoma and rumors linking him to LSU, arguing Riley has consistently avoided tougher competitive paths.\n\nAccording to Quinn, shelving the rivalry strips USC of a defining annual stage. “That game brought relevance,” Quinn said. “And it’s gone because he knows he can’t win it.”\n\nMichigan’s Biff Poggi warns up to 25 players may not return after Christmas break\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nWhy Diego Pavia attorneys are fighting the NCAA for seventh year of eligibility",

    "fullText": "2025 will be looked back upon as a year of transition for Manchester City. The first half of 2025 saw Pep Guardiola’s team claw their way to Champions League qualification and also lose the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace. At the end of the 24/25 season, a host of club legends departed the club, and a new wave of players and leaders has taken their place. Although City haven’t claimed silverware throughout 2025, the year may well be looked back upon as the one that gave birth to Manchester City’s next era of success.\n\n2025 began with Manchester City in need of a refresh. It was clear as 2025 began that the iteration of Pep Guardiola’s side that began this calendar year was on its last legs. The well was dry as City legends legs had nothing left to give. Players such as Kyle Walker, Ilkay Gundogan, and Kevin De Bruyne had reached their physical limit. On top of that, injuries had ravaged Pep Guardiola’s squad. City hit the 2025 January transfer window with gusto. Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis, Nico, and Omar Marmoush all joined the club to reinforce the City squad. Each player showed flashes of what they could add to Manchester City’s play. In the case of Omar Marmoush, his goals were crucial in helping City ultimately secure Champions League football for the 25/26 season.\n\nThere are too many individual moments and matches to go over that defined the first half of 2025. In the end, Pep Guardiola tweaked his lineup to make his team hard to beat. That tactical shift worked as City secured third place in the Premier League and made the FA Cup final. From the mire that surrounded Pep Guardiola’s side to begin 2025, something was salvaged for City from a difficult situation.\n\nAt the end of the 24/25 season, a host of club legends departed Manchester City. Kevin De Bruyne didn’t have his contract renewed at the end of last season. De Bruyne received a farewell from the Manchester City fans that was fit for a player of his status. It was sad to see De Bruyne leave City but at least he got the farewell he deserved. Ederson left Manchester City for Fenerbahce late in last summer’s transfer window. Unfortunately, Ederson didn’t get his own farewell at the Etihad. Given how integral he had been to Manchester City’s success Ederson did deserve his moment in front of the City faithful.\n\nKyle Walker left Manchester City on loan to join AC Milan last January. Walker’s loan move was a sad ending to his City career. Kyle Walker was key in Manchester City’s success but the way his City career ultimately ended was sad to watch unfold. The England international returned to City after his loan spell at AC Milan before moving to Burnley last summer. The circumstances that Walker left in as club captain did leave a sour taste in the mouth. It doesn’t diminish Walker’s achievements at City but perhaps he could have handled his departure, and loss of pace better to leave City on better terms.\n\nJack Grealish and Manuel Akanji left City on loan for season long loans at Everton and Inter Milan. Grealish played a key role in Manchester City’s treble-winning season in 22/23. From that point onwards, Grealish didn’t ever reach that level again and it was sad to see him go out on loan. Although it was for the best. Manuel Akanji gave everything to the cause at City, and he played a key role in Manchester City’s success during his spell at the Etihad.\n\nLastly, Ilkay Gundogan left City for Galatasaray. Gundogan returned to the club for the 24/25 season from Barcelona. Last season didn’t go as Gundogan would’ve liked but he left City for the second time with his reputation intact as a club legend.\n\nAs club legends and important players left City a host of new signings arrived. Rayan Ait-Nouri, Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, James Trafford, Gianluigi Donnarumma, and Sverre Nypan were all signed by City last summer. Cherki, Donnarumma, and Tijjani Reijnders have all provided a lift to Pep Guardiola’s side. Trafford and Ait-Nouri haven’t established themselves in the first team at City. Trafford has Gianluigi Donnarumma in his way. Ait-Nouri was hit by injury and the strong form of Nico O’Reilly at left-back has seen Ait-Nouri yet to make an impact at City. Sverre Nypan is a signing for the future and is on loan at Middlesbrough this season.\n\nAs the 24/25 season ended and before the 25/26 season began, Manchester City participated in the FIFA Club World Cup. Although City’s tournament ended early at the hands of Al-Hilal, the time spent in the United States by Pep Guardiola’s squad has been key in their revival. Baby steps were taken by the new-look City squad and those steps have become strides as the 25/26 season has progressed.\n\nAlthough Manchester City began the 25/26 season with two defeats in their first three Premier League matches, this City side has now grown. They sit second in the Premier League, are well-placed in the Champions League, and have made the Carabao Cup semi-final stage. Pep Guardiola’s side isn’t at its best, there is still improvement to come.\n\nErling Haaland, Phil Foden, Jeremy Doku, Rayan Cherki, Nico, Nico O’Reilly, Matheus Nunes, Josko Gvardiol, Ruben Dias, and Gianluigi Donnarumma have established themselves as the next iteration of Pep Guardiola’s side. Rodri is yet to return properly after a serious ACL injury. Hope is high for what Manchester City could achieve entering 2026.\n\n2025 has been a year of transition at Manchester City. After so much success across seven seasons, that was bound to happen eventually. During the first half of 2025 City did what they had to do. But the seeds planted at the end of the 24/25 season or in the first half of 2025 have begun to sprout.\n\nEntering 2026 it is clear to see that Manchester City has turned the corner. 2025 is ultimately the year the club had to have. It was sad at times. It was also frustrating on other occasions. As 2025 ends, hope is high for 2026 and beyond at Manchester City.",

The Name to Know Player of the Game is sponsored by John’s Sewer and Drain Cleaning, the Name to Know when your drains don’t flow.\n\nIt was a slow start for White, including missing his first seven 3-pointers on the night. But he finished the game with 27 points, seven rebounds and six assists, including a career-high seven blocks. White scored 22 points in the second half, helping the Celtics to the victory.\n\nIt was a forgettable shooting night to start for White, but his impact goes beyond just how many points he scored. The defense was on full display as he was seemingly flying everywhere and swatting shots. White also finished 8-for-16 from the field, including 2-for-10 on his 3-pointers. It helped that he was 9-for-9 from the free throw line.\n\nThe Celtics dropped a disappointing loss to the Trail Blazers last time out, so Tuesday’s victory was a much-needed bounce-back.

(AP) — By rookie VJ Edgecombe's calculation, he mistimed his game-winner in overtime.\n\n“To be honest, I was actually trying to go when the buzzer (went) off, but it was a little bit too early,\" Edgecombe said. ”But it went in, and that's all that matters.\"\n\nEdgecombe, the 6-foot-4 guard out of Baylor, connected on a 25-foot jumper with 1.7 seconds left, capping a 25-point night, and giving Philadelphia a 139-136 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night.\n\nEdgecombe, the third overall pick in the 2025 draft, brought the Sixers back into the game in the fourth quarter. He scored 13 points in the period, going 5 of 10 from the field, including 3 of 4 from outside the arc. A pair of 3-pointers near the four-minute mark helped erase a Memphis advantage. His 3-pointer with 1:55 left in regulation gave the 76ers a 128-121 lead, but Memphis behind Ja Morant, pulled even at 128, sending the game into the extra period.\n\nAfter Memphis took an early lead, baskets by Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid (34 points each), and Paul George (17 points) tied the game. A drive by Memphis guard Morant tied the game at 136 with 18.3 seconds left, setting the stage for the game-winner.\n\n“My teammates have faith in us to make a play, and that's what happened,” Edgecombe said.\n\n“It's a big shot,” Sixers coach Nick Nurse said. “Obviously, a game-winner for a rookie is pretty cool.”\n\nNurse has admired the poise of Edgecombe, who is averaging 15.5 points a game.\n\n“He's kind of like that all the time,” Nurse said of the rookie guard. “I never see him show much emotion. I think it's an incredible quality. He just plays the game.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "The last couple of weeks of the offseason have not had much movement, but rumors surrounding the Boston Red Sox continue to fly.\n\nKetel Marte has become a hot name on the trade block, and the Red Sox are rumored to be interested in him. According to The Boston Globe’s Alex Speier, Marte is one of the Red Sox’s primary targets. Arizona Diamondbacks general manager Mike Hazen dropped an update on where the team stands on trading Marte.\n\n“We’re very likely to put an end to this shortly…” Hazen said on Tuesday, per MLB.com’s Steve Gilbert. “But this isn’t going to continue to linger. We need to focus our offseason. Again, my gut this whole time was that (a trade of Marte) wasn’t going to happen, and I think it seems likely that that’s the case and we want to focus on other things we need to do.”\n\nThe Diamondbacks reportedly have a high price tag on Marte, and Hazen knows teams may not be willing to meet their demands. Hazen also noted that he has not given interested teams a deadline, but they know time is running out.\n\nThe Red Sox’s top target is reportedly Alex Bregman, and their interest in Marte seems to be as a backup plan. However, he may not be on the board much longer.\n\nThe Red Sox seemingly want Bregman back, but it may require Craig Breslow to go out of his comfort zone. Bregman wants a long-term deal and Breslow has not given out such a contract since taking over.\n\nHowever, he spoke highly of Bregman at the winter meetings and knows the impact he had in the clubhouse as well as on the field. He is one of the best free agents available, and Boston would be wise to keep him around.\n\nMLB Analyst Gives His Hall Of Fame Verdict For Manny Ramirez, Roger Clemens",

It was a high-scoring affair for both teams, which is the norm in Salt Lake City, but the Celtics defense, especially from Derrick White, was ultimately the key for the victory.\n\nAfter a slow start for both Derrick White and Jaylen Brown in the first half, the two were able to turn it on, including White, who was without a doubt the most important player of the game. White finished the night with 27 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, and a career-high 7 blocks, showing his special ability as one of the team's most valuable and efficient players on both ends of the court.\n\nHere's a quick recap of the Celtics 10-point win over the Jazz on Tuesday night:\n\nSecond half surge: Scoring 59 points in the first half, Boston came out well in the second and put up a total of points in the second half. The Celtics were carried by White and Brown who had timely buckets throughout, and the aforementioned defense by White who had 7 of the team's 9 defensive blocks. Utah kept the game close throughout the first three quarters, but when they needed their stars, Boston was able to rely on them and see them pull out the victory.\n\nPoints in the paint: In their first meeting this season in which Utah got the win, Boston was dominated on the offensive side of the glass, giving the Jazz plenty of second chance opportunities. Even with Lauri Markkanen and Jusuf Nurkic down low in the paint, the Celtics outscored the Jazz 56-46 in points in the paint, which is a good sign for them as they struggled in shooting 30% from 3-point range.\n\nTurnovers: Along with the 9 blocks from their team, the Celtics defense was all over the young Jazz team, forcing 13 turnovers, 8 of which came off of steals. Between the blocks and steals, Boston was all over the court on Tuesday night and making it uncomfortable for the Jazz is ultimately what helped carried them to pull away in the final minutes.\n\nCAREER HIGH 7 BLOCKS FOR DERRICK WHITE!! pic.twitter.com/V3FaHLsaMA\n\n— Danielle Hobeika (@DanielleHobeika) December 31, 2025\n\nThis will be the first of two matchups this season between two franchises going in opposite directions during the 2025 season. The Celtics, even without Jayson Tatum, find themselves right in the mix at the top of the Eastern Conference standings, while the Sacramento Kings, coming into December 30, have just 8 victories on the year. Predominately led by veterans DeMarr DeRozan and Russell Westbrook, the Kings have a wide gap in the experience factor on their roster. Boston will look to start another winning streak and start the 2026 calendar year on a high note.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: Celtics get back in win column with big second half vs. Jazz",

    "description": "A new No. 11 will be manning the infield at Fenway Park in 2026.",
    "fullText": "When Rafael Devers was shockingly traded away on Father’s Day during the 2025 season, he ended up changing from the No. 11 he wore the first eight and a half years of his career in Boston to No. 16 with his new team in San Francisco. With the Giants having retired Hall of Fame pitcher Carl Hubbell’s No. 11 back in 1944, it took that number off the table for the then-28-year-old third-baseman-turned-designated-hitter-turned-first-baseman.\n\nThat also meant Devers’ No. 11 opened up as an option for the Red Sox to hand out to any new players being added to the roster, whether that be via trade or in the way of minor league players getting called up to the majors.\n\nDespite multiple players having the option to nab “sticks” as a number over the course of three and a half months, no one jumped at the opportunity.\n\nBut as 2025 comes to a close, one of last season’s newcomers is making the switch.\n\nJust like everyone who has taped over their Mac Jones No. 10 Patriots jerseys, it’s time to break out the duct tape!\n\nMarcelo Mayer is officially switching from No. 39 to No. 11, meaning one of Boston’s most exciting young players will once again be rocking the number once made famous in this region by Drew Bledsoe and Julian Edelman.\n\nBoston Red Sox Reportedly Looking For Bullpen Help\n\nLucas Giolito Is Caught in Baseball’s New Free Agent Gray Area\n\nCraig Breslow Trades Because He Has To\n\nNate Eaton is also changing numbers, moving from No. 40 to No. 18, while recent trade acquisition Willson Contreras will take over No. 40.\n\nThe changes were updated on the Red Sox’s official website on Tuesday.\n\nDuring Devers’ run in No. 11, he earned three All-Star selections, won two Silver Sluggers, and played a central role on the 2018 World Series team at only 22 years old.\n\nNow, the number passes to Mayer - and with it, at least some added attention.\n\nThe 23-year-old infielder is expected to take on a larger role in 2026 after a learning-on-the-job rookie season. Mayer was called up from Worcester earlier than expected in 2025 after Alex Bregman’s quad injury led to infield instability, and slashed .228/.272/.402 while showing flashes of the tools that made him one of the organization’s top prospects in the hot corner.\n\nWhere Mayer ultimately settles defensively remains tied to how the rest of the offseason unfolds. He could open the year as the everyday second baseman, or slide over to where he spent most of last season at third, depending on how the roster shakes out.\n\nEither way, Mayer stepping into No. 11 feels symbolic.\n\nIt’s not about replacing Devers - that’s impossible. But it does reflect where the Red Sox are headed: turning the page, handing responsibility to the next wave, and seeing who’s ready to carry it.\n\nThe number is new. The opportunity is bigger.\n\nRemember to join our RED SOX on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2025 Liberty Mutual Music City Bowl was a game of momentum. Luckily for Illinois, coach Bret Bielema had the last laugh.\n\nA David Olano game-winning field goal opposite the Tennessee Volunteersas time expired Tuesday night in Nashville was the fitting final chapter of a two-year program stretch that can best be described as remarkable.\n\nA 19-7 mark in the last two seasons, alongside finishing 13-4 in one-score games, shows just how far Bielema has taken the Illini. Better yet, he is the first coach in school history to lead Illinois to two seasons of nine wins or more back-to-back and finish the year with consecutive bowl wins when all is said and done.\n\nBielema told reporters the come-from-behind win, which saw senior quarterback Luke Altmyer engineer a 13-play, 64-yard drive while nearly eating the final five minutes of regulation, was bigger than just help from the Naperville, Illinois, native.\n\n\"I remember dealing with some adversity with both these guys, but also a lot of success,\" Bielema said, \"I think as a head coach, one thing that really, it does define your success is after they leave you, what do they do, right?\"\n\nBielema said he is excited to see where Altmyer and defensive back Miles Scott end up, should they get drafted next spring.\n\n\"But I'm going to watch both these guys play in the NFL and I'm going to smile a lot, right?\" Bielema said. \"Because you were with them on their journey.\"\n\nThe \"journey\" saw highs and lows for an Illinois team that remained in the College Football Playoff mix through mid-November, a feat unachievable just five years ago.\n\nBielema said he wants this year's team to be remembered as a group where togetherness was the main catalyst while also taking a swipe at the SEC.\n\n\"I know I think SEC is now 0-4 and we'd be 5-0 in the Big Ten,\" Bielema said. \"I'm going to take that every day, right? Uh, so, um, little propaganda there, but propaganda is good propaganda.\"\n\nNow, the off-season officially begins in Champaign.",

    "description": "Illinois football coach Bret Bielema met with the media following his team's 30-28 victory against Tennessee in the Music City Bowl.",
    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Illinois football coach Bret Bielema met with the media following the Fighting Illini's 30-28 victory over the Tennessee Volunteers in the Music City Bowl.\n\nHere is the full transcript of what the Illinois coach had to say in the news conference, starting with his opening statement as he sat beside seniors Miles Scott and Luke Altmyer:\n\nOpening statement: \"First, I just wanna say thank you to the Music City Bowl. From the time we got the invitation to where we are today, just took care of us, all of our families, all of our players, to be at the hotel and to share the experience this week.\n\n\"But ultimately, to have the game today, get another victory two years in a row now against the SEC opponent. Give all the credit to Tennessee, a really good football team. Got tremendous respect for Coach (Josh) Heupel and his staff and what they've been able to accomplish this year.\n\n\"But I'm super excited for these guys, these two guys to my left, just represent everything about Illinois football. Obviously, there's a win and all that goes into it, but these two guys represent everything you want college football to be. So these games are always great, but they're also very sad.\n\n\"I had a very tough time in our meeting last night cuz I knew this was gonna be the last time I was with a variety of guys. And to give them this moment that they'll carry with them. But bowl games are unique in the fact that you carry them for the entire six months before we play again.\n\n\"So really excited about that. With that, we'll open it up for some questions.\"\n\nRecap: Illinois wins dramatic Music City Bowl with field goal in final seconds\n\nQuestion: Coach … will you take us through that final game-winning drive?\n\nBielema: \"Really, we had five minutes. I knew that if we had a feeling we would be able to score.\n\n\"I didn't know if it was gonna be a field goal or a touchdown. But once the drive kinda continued to happen, great execution by Luke on the third and sixth to get him to jump, which made it to third and one. And then centered it up there for David Olano to hit his game win field goal.\n\n\"But I really knew the ball in nine's hands, we were gonna be in good shape. I was just hoping that we could take it down to minimal clock for our defense. Not that we didn't have confidence, but we just needed to take the air out of their tires and kinda make it all ours.\"\n\nQuestion: Coach, it was a 94-yard kick return right before that that gave Tennessee the lead. How were you guys able to sustain things despite a sudden change like that?\n\nBielema: \"Well, I would just say this. It's not what happened, it's how you react to what happened. We preach it, we talk it, we live it.\n\n\"Obviously, an unfortunate deal. They had the ball hit the ground. They got around our right edge. I know there was some leakage up there in the middle, and then their guy created a play. Hey, you're playing a team with a lot of good players. But it's not that act that's gonna end us. It's gonna be our reaction. And then obviously our offense went out and did it very, very well. So super excited for our guys.\"\n\nQuestion: Coach, with 19 wins in two years … What's happening to you guys and these guys up here?\n\nBielema: \"We have talked a lot about different numbers, and I showed them last night. When we got done with the last win of the year with Northwestern at home, there were several records that we had either tied or broke, right? And I knew that if we got this one tonight, that would set all kinds of records. And we don't have to read about other years anymore. I think people usually either read about history or write history. And this group's writing history.\n\n\"And I think we'll continue to do that. … I believe that puts us at 13-4 in one-score games over the last several years, which is just an incredible statistic. And I think a lot of it is that Luke has a lot of confidence. But when Luke shows his confidence through the way he plays, it makes everybody else around him play very, very well. So a very contagious player, and it affects the whole team.\"\n\nQuestion: Brett, you went for it on a couple fourth downs, had David kick three times. What kind of went into those decisions?\n\nBielema: \"Well, the first two and a half were, David felt good from the 25, 27-yard line going that direction. So we were just outside of those marks, and I would rather go for it, rather than try to punt it away or pooch it.\n\n\"So both of those, I would do again 100 times over. We went for a fourth down on a couple of those drives there at the end, and it ended up working our way. So David's a very good field goal kicker, but it just felt for us to win the game, we need to be aggressive in those moments.\n\n\"And for the most part, it played in our favor. Then when you put the game in his foot, I guess, instead of his hands, just what was kind of your thoughts as he went out there? Well, not just David. David would be the first to tell you, right, the snapper, the holder. … And a lot of really, really good things that when you have confidence in your kicker, but also in the operation, that makes you play the game. I give credit to my coaches.\n\n\"Ben Miller is a huge asset to our football team on the sidelines. He and I were talking through the fourth quarter clock situation there at least five or six times in the last seven or eight minutes that ended up playing out to a tee.\"\n\nQuestion: Brett, when you look back on the 2025 season, what is probably going to be your biggest takeaway from it, and why?\n\nBielema: \"Well, I tell our players all the time, right? As players and coaches, you're often defined by your record, right? Like the wins and losses, but for me as a head coach now, just finished my 17th year as a head coach, it's the memories that are created.\n\n\"With these guys, I remember the first time Miles walked into my office, or the first time Luke walked into my office. I remember dealing with some adversity with both these guys, but also a lot of success. I think as a head coach, one thing that really defines your success is after they leave you, what do they do, right? Both these kids, both these guys come from incredible people, families, moms and dads that have put them in these positions.\n\n\"But I'm gonna watch both these guys play in the NFL, and I'm gonna smile a lot, right, because you were with them on their journey. So just these memories, it's kind of funny, both of them are sitting here. My youngest daughter asked me about Luke Altmeyer literally on an every-day basis.\n\n\"And we were sitting in a team meeting, or a team meal at the country club, one of the last meals we had, and my daughter walks up, sits on my lap. She goes, where's Miles? I said, Miles Scott? She said, yeah, all the boys in my class wanna be Miles Scott.\n\n\"And I just was smiling because he's a defensive player that has turned his life into a former wide receiver to a DB. And now that there's young people in this community that wanna be Miles Scott, they have no idea how much that makes me as a head coach feel, but so proud of what they've accomplished in so many ways. So the 2025 season was a team that beat two bowl games back-to-back against SEC teams.\n\n\"I think SEC is now 0-4, it would be 5-0 in the Big Ten. I'm gonna take that every day, right? So a little propaganda there, but propaganda is good propaganda.\"\n\nQuestion: I guess Brett, now that Luke is done, can you put a bow on what he meant for the elevation of this program and why he was able to take this program?\n\nBielema: \"Yeah, I think the two things that I always take from Luke is just, he took a chance on us, right? He had a million different opportunities. He was a very sought-after player in the portal. I love the fact that he stayed with his team because they needed him through the bowl game, which really gave us the chance to have it.\n\n\"And we thought we were gonna have Tommy back. And then when that got denied, it kind of made us late to the portal. And since he was late coming out, that actually made everything in our favor.\n\n\"But the growth for me as a head coach, what I've learned from Luke and his end-of-half, end-of-game scenarios, we have these meetings and his voice that he speaks with his confidence. But then to see the reaction of our fans and the people say so many things about what he's accomplished. And his mom and dad always talk about they dropped off a young man that was kind of in a tough spot from where he came from. And it brought him here to Champaign in the middle of January. It was cold and they were dropping him off and leaving him. And now he's coming out of here, he's about as confident and full of a very, very, very bright future. That's probably what I'll always think about.\"\n\nBeating the SEC and loving Luke: Social media reacts to Illinois bowl victory\n\nQuestion: Just defensively, what did you feel like worked out well today and allowed you guys to be aggressive and get a lot of negative plays?\n\nBielema: \"We wanted to make sure that we got our feet in the grass and we could read and react and play a little bit more zone than we've ever probably played. Which I think took them off their mark a little bit. But it gets some pressure up front. The good thing was we knew they're a good offense. They created a few plays. But the defense always bowed up.\n\n\"I think that stop in the first half to hold them to a field goal. It went wide right, was a really, really big deal. And then the offensive response.\n\n\"But yeah, there was a lot of great efforts out there. Really all three phases win this game. We talk about it all the time, right? Penalties, mental errors, and turnovers. But we did not commit those, they did. And then on the flip side of it, we had three keys to victory. And our last key was to have great situational football awareness and execution. And that was defined in the fourth quarter here today. So really fun to see a game plan work out.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Journal Star: Everything Bret Bielema said after Illinois beat Tennessee in the Music City Bowl",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Saints quarterback Drew Brees is on a fast track to the Pro Football Hall of Fame — and few would argue otherwise.\n\nThe Super Bowl XLIV champion was named one of the 15 finalists for the Class of 2026, placing him one step away from enshrinement in Canton.\n\nThe Hall’s 50-member selection committee will vote on the finalists next month, with the results announced Feb. 5 during “NFL Honors.” Under the current format, between three and five modern-era finalists will be inducted, marking the second year of the revised process.\n\nBrees’ résumé is among the strongest in NFL history. He ranks second all-time to Tom Brady with 80,358 passing yards and 571 touchdown passes. After spending the first five seasons of his career with the San Diego Chargers, Brees signed with New Orleans in 2006 — a move that changed both his career and the franchise’s trajectory.\n\nHe became the face of a city rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina and ultimately led the Saints to their first Super Bowl title following the 2009 season, earning Super Bowl MVP honors in a win over Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nOver his career, Brees was selected to 13 Pro Bowls, won AP Offensive Player of the Year twice (2008, 2011), earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2006 and was named second-team All-Pro four times.\n\nJoining Brees as finalists are first-year eligibles Larry Fitzgerald, Jason Witten and Frank Gore. Willie Anderson, Torry Holt, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri earned automatic finalist status after advancing to the final seven for the Class of 2025.\n\nReturning finalists include Eli Manning, Reggie Wayne, Jahri Evans, Marshal Yanda, Terrell Suggs and Darren Woodson, while defensive tackle Kevin Williams reached the finalist stage for the first time in his sixth year of eligibility.\n\nThe committee will also consider senior candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood, along with coach Bill Belichick and contributor Robert Kraft. Between one and three of those candidates will be inducted.\n\nOnly four people were inducted last year, making it the smallest Hall of Fame class in the past 20 years.",

But what happens if their six-game win streak is snapped at home Saturday night?\n\nWhile fans may not want to consider the possibility of a defeat at the hands of the Seattle Seahawks at Levi's Stadium, it's worth exploring what happens should the 49ers fall, where they'd wind up seeded and what teams they could play in the first round if they miss out on the bye week.\n\nHere are the seeding scenarios and potential playoff matchups awaiting the 49ers after Week 18:\n\nThis is tough to answer since there is no certainty just yet. San Francisco would secure a bye week on wild card weekend should they get the top seed. After that they'd be in line to host the lowest-remaining seed, which could very well be either the No. 5 or No. 6 seed which would be one of the Los Angeles Rams or Seahawks.\n\nTwo things would have to happen here, and it requires San Francisco to get some help by way of the division record tiebreaker. If the Rams beat the Cardinals, they'll have the same division record as the 49ers. That would move the next tiebreaker to record against common opponents where LA has a sizable advantage. If LA falls to the Cardinals, they'll finish with a worse division record than the 49ers, giving San Francisco the tiebreaking edge.\n\nSecuring the No. 5 seed would be preferable for matchup purposes if they're not getting the top spot. They'd have to go on the road for wild card weekend, but their opponent would be dependent on the outcome of Saturday afternoon's game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers.\n\nPanthers win Week 18: 49ers at Panthers\n\nBuccaneers win Week 18: 49ers at Buccaneers\n\nPanthers-Buccaneers tie Week 18: 49ers at Panthers\n\nThis is the worst-case scenario for San Francisco, but it's probably likelier than the No. 5 seed.\n\nWhere the 49ers would go for their wild card game depends on how things shake out for the Chicago Bears and Philadelphia Eagles in their respective season finales. Chicago is currently the No. 2 seed and on track to host the No. 7 seed Green Bay Packers. Philadelphia has the same record as Chicago, but the Bears beat them head-to-head and hold that tiebreaker.\n\nBears win Week 18: 49ers at Eagles\n\nBears lose and Eagles lose in Week 18: 49ers at Eagles\n\nBears lose and Eagles win or tie in Week 18: 49ers at Bears\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers PFF grades: Best and worst grades from Week 17 win vs. Bears\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: NFL playoffs: 49ers Week 18 seeding scenarios, potential opponents",

    "description": "This seems to pave the way for a Liverpool move.",
    "fullText": "According to a report by South American outlet Bola VIP, Chelsea have withdrawn from negotiations for Club Brugge’s Joel Ordóñez. It was said that Stamford Bridge was the player’s preferred destination, but the London club’s withdrawal has paved the way for a move to Liverpool FC. However, Inter Milan is said to be still monitoring the situation closely.\n\nThe 21-year-old Ecuadorian defender is actually a familiar name from earlier this summer, as he was also briefly linked with a move to Anfield before Liverpool eventually settled on Giovanni Leoni.\n\nIt may seem a little curious why Liverpool would ask a defender playing in the Belgian Pro League to make a giant leap towards playing in the Premier League, but Brugge had a very good Champions League campaign for their standards last season, and about 20% of Ordóñez’s 100+ appearances for the club have been made in Europe’s premier competition.\n\nOrdóñez’s standout traits include his passing and general composure on and off the ball, which have made him one of the more promising young centre-backs in European football. Liverpool seem to be prioritising defenders who are good on the ball, with the failed chase for Marc Guehi and the signing of Leoni over the summer highlighting their desire for defenders of that profile.\n\nWith Leoni out for the season, Liverpool need some bodies in that department, and they can fulfil both long- and short-term needs if they choose to pursue Ordóñez. The player is expected to cost around €40m. Liverpool do have some good history with centre-backs named Joel, so we’ll see if this one gains further traction as the winter transfer window opens.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona are reportedly tracking Bayer Leverkusen’s Algerian prodigy Ibrahim Maza at the African Cup of Nations 2025 (h/t Mundo Deportivo).\n\nThe 20-year-old has been in scintillating form for Algeria, scoring in the 3-0 win against Sudan. He also produced a solid display in the 1-0 win against Burkina Faso.\n\nBarca scouts have been impressed by Maza’s performances, with the Catalan giants adding him as a potential future target.\n\nLeverkusen paid €12 million for Maza’s services from Hertha BSC in the summer, and he has made a significant impact this season.\n\nHe has netted four goals and three assists for Die Werkself in all competitions, while garnering wider attention for his impressive displays in the Champions League against Manchester City and Newcastle United.\n\nOperating as a No.10, Maza ranks among the elite dribblers and creative passers in Europe. His shooting prowess makes him a dangerous outlet in the attacking third.\n\nThe Algerian prospect has been pivotal behind Leverkusen’s resurgence under Kasper Hjulmand, with the Bundesliga giants now sitting third in the table following a disastrous start to the season.\n\nMaza’s stock could skyrocket if he continues his fine form with Algeria at the AFCON. He will be next in action against DR Congo in the Round of 16.\n\nBarca are currently stacked with quality attacking midfield options such as Dani Olmo and Fermin Lopez.\n\nHowever, Hansi Flick’s men will not pass up a chance to sign a top-quality talent like Maza, given Olmo’s injury struggles and lack of consistency.\n\nBarca’s priority will be adding a centre-back and a striker for the summer of 2026.\n\nNottingham Forest’s Murillo, Borussia Dortmund’s Nico Schlotterbeck, Atletico Madrid’s Julian Alvarez, and Levante’s Karl Etta Eyong are some of the reported targets.",

    "fullText": "From the moment reports broke that RC Lens were close to signing Samson Baidoo from Red Bull Salzburg in the summer, a very obvious comparison awaited the Austrian international. As a centre-back capable of playing in the middle of a back three, it was hard to ignore the idea that Lens had found their successor to Kevin Danso, who had left midway through last season for Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nLens had tried hard to keep their interest in Baidoo a secret for as long as possible. They had to work quickly and quietly or else they would lose momentum, as the 21-year-old was on the radars of far richer clubs in the Premier League, but they had not yet been stirred into action. As soon as news leaked that Lens had made contact, they knew that these clubs would have bids readied. And that is exactly what is reported to have happened.\n\nL’Équipe wrote that two Premier League clubs sent delegations to try to swoop for Baidoo. They offered a far more lucrative deal to the club and the player, but it was too late. Lens had, in stealth, laid out the groundwork in a reported €8m deal and provided a convincing case for why the Austrian should continue his progress in France. A case that was helped by their former player.\n\nBaidoo would tell the French outlet that Danso had spoken to him before the move, telling him, “That if I want to focus solely on football, [Lens] is the place to be. He’s changed here as a person, as a player. He’s given me a lot of confidence.” It’s a decision that has worked out perfectly for the young defender; he has put in a star turn in a team that has climbed to first in the league on the back of their unflinching defensive performances.\n\nThis is all the more impressive when considering that this is a Lens side that had its defence decimated over the past two transfer windows, with the sales and departures of the likes of Danso, Abdukodir Khusanov, and Facundo Medina. Baidoo has helped make the memory of those players a distant one, and it is becoming increasingly obvious that when he eventually leaves the north of France, it will be for far more than they originally signed him for.",

    "fullText": "Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. is dealing with another injury in a season that has been disappointing. On Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals, he exited the game with an injury that head coach Jonathan Gannon said was his heel.\n\nGannon clarified that it was not Harrison's heel that he injured. It was his foot.\n\nHarrison was playing in his second game back from a heel injury. While many believed he reaggravated the same heel, it was actually an injury to his other foot.\n\nHarrison has missed four of the last seven games. He missed two after he had his appendix removed. He got hurt in Week 13, injuring his heel against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 13. He missed two more games and then had a limited load against Atlanta and Cincinnati.\n\nWill he play in the finale on Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams? Gannon gave the standard statement: “If he's healthy enough to play, he'll play.”\n\nIn 12 games this season, Harrison has 41 receptions for 608 yards and four touchdowns. He did not have a catch on Sunday against the Bengals, getting targeted just once.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Three managers, 12 fewer wins than the champions, 16 losses, and the third-fewest goals scored. It was a disaster of a 2025 Hana Bank K League 1 season for Ulsan HD, finishing ninth and only surviving relegation on the last day.\n\nUlsan avoided the relegation playoffs, the indignity of what could have been. That is about as good as it gets domestically after what has been a very strange season, a relative disaster. Finishing ninth with safety only secured on the final day, and only done so via default with results elsewhere going their way, represents a dark year for a club that had come off three consecutive K League title wins.  The Horangi's ACLE campaign has been decent, though, with two wins, two draws, and two losses so far, and they are just about on course to reach the knockouts.\n\nThe generation shift didn't pan out, nor did two managerial appointments. Kim Pan-gon was shown the door, then not long after, so was Shin Tae-yong. There appears to have been dressing room unrest as a result of said managerial appointments, meaning academy director and former Jeonnam manager Noh Sang-rae who was appointed caretaker, in an underwhelming pick as can be, had a thankless task on his hands to steer this juggernaut away from danger. Across the three managers, Kim Pan-gon earned eight wins, Shin Tae-yong just one, and Noh Sang-rae three.\n\nThings weren't looking too bad for Ulsan until the build-up to the Club World Cup, but three losses in the U.S., having departed for the tournament on the back of a defeat, seemed to create a snowball effect that just couldn't be slowed down. The Horangi were toothless and went on a run of 11 without a win, but then a 1-0 victory over Jeju was followed up with three straight losses and a run of seven without a win in the league. Once the going got tough, even with the experience of Kim Young-gwon, Lee Chung-yong, Jo Hyeon-woo, Jung Woo-young, and the like, Ulsan just could not get out of that rut.\n\nA lack of firepower meant Ulsan were the joint-second lowest scorers in Final B and third-lowest overall.\n\nChoi Seok-hyeon's versatility gets him the nod for Ulsan's young player of the year ahead of winger Yoon Jae-seok (30 apps, 1 goal), and attacking midfielder Back In-woo (12 apps, 1 goal). Choi looked confident enough to slot in as either a right-sided centre back in a three or right back in a four, he even popped up at left midfield on a couple of occasions. Choi made 23 appearances and had his best run from July to October, featuring in nine of 11 games from Round 23 to 32. The signing of Jung Seung-hyun has pushed Choi down the pecking order, leaving him as third or fourth choice to partner Kim Young-gwon, but it was a solid second season for the 22-year-old, first at K League 1 level.\n\nHe was accused of being too tidy a footballer, not gritty enough for a relegation battle with his \"pretty technique\" by then-manager Shin Tae-yong, but Swedish central midfielder Darijan Bojanic was a very important player for Ulsan again this year. With a lot of sideways passes and a lack of direction in Ulsan's midfield at times, Bojanic offers a less shackled approach, gliding from box to box. Without the Swede in central midfield, Ulsan were often guilty of sticking to a 4/4 in musical terms, but Bojanic has the chops to play more expressively, in 5/4 or maybe 7/8 at the right moments. He should be central to Ulsan's rebuild for 2026.\n\nLee Jin-hyun, attacking midfielder\n\nThe signing of Lee Jin-hyun looked like a real coup with the former Pohang, Daegu, and Daejeon attacking midfielder returning to K League from a one-year spell in Poland. He would have had plenty of suiters for his signature, but for whatever reason, Lee Jin-hyun just never got going in a Ulsan shirt.  The same could be said for a lot of Ulsan's recruits in 2025, but with three managers and a lot of off-the-field drama, it's perhaps understandable. Lee managed one goal and two assists in the league, but is a player who managed three goals and six assists for Daejeon in 2023 before departing for Ekstraklasa side Puszcza Niepolomice, and just doesn't become a bad player overnight.\n\nFinding the silver lining of 2025 is that it can't get much worse for Ulsan. Club legend Kim Hyun-seok has been appointed as manager, so there should be some goodwill among the supporters for the time being. Kim should at least be given time to shape this squad. Ulsan have a big squad, even with key departures like Gustav Ludwigson and Um Won-sang, so it may be more about the shape Kim opts to set this Ulsan team up in. Last season with Jeonnam Dragons, Kim used a 5-3-2 for the most part but a back three was used by 11 times last year by two different managers, yielding just two wins. During Kim's highly successful season at Chungnam Asan in 2024, which saw the Owls finish second, his system was more of a 4-3-3 with some tendency to use a back three. Do Ulsan have the wingbacks for a back three/five? Homework for Kim Hyun-seok.",

    "fullText": "As a member of Wisconsin’s 2020 recruiting class, Preston Zachman was one of the Badgers’ longest tenured players.\n\nFor the 2026 season, he seeks a change of scenery.\n\nThe veteran safety, who missed most of the season due to a leg injury, will enter the transfer for his final season of eligibility. On3 reported the news and Zachman reposted it on his X and Instagram accounts.\n\nZachman, who is 6-foot-1, 212 pounds, suffered the injury against Alabama on Sept. 13. After that he could be seen on the sideline during games wearing a walking book on his left leg.\n\nPrior to the injury, Zachman was a vital piece of the Badgers' defense.\n\nHe finished this season with 12 tackles, nine solos, and tied for the team high with two interceptions. Both of those turnovers came in the second half of the season opener against Miami (Ohio) and helped UW close out a 17-0 victory.\n\nHe started 20 games for UW and played 35 overall.\n\n“He was the leader of the defense,” Badgers coach Luke Fickell said Nov. 3. “He was making most of the calls and was just that corner piece.\n\n\"It's been one of those things we've had to be able to overcome and had to spread out some of that (responsibility) the last seven weeks.”\n\nNews of Zachman’s departure came three days before the transfer portal opens. The Badgers might seek help at safety to offset the lost of Zachman as well as starter Austin Brown, who completed his eligibility.\n\nMatt Jung, a rising senior, is expected to return. Matt Traynor, who was the third safety following Zachman's injury, is recovering from an ACL injury he suffered against Ohio State Oct. 18.\n\nMore: Wisconsin football transfer portal tracker: QB Billy Edwards will make his comeback elsewhere\n\nMore: A look at Wisconsin football's needs from the transfer portal\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin veteran safety Preston Zachman will enter transfer portal",

    "fullText": "Nick Nurse is glad to see Maxey and Edgecombe thriving together in the backcourt originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers got a big win on Tuesday against the Memphis Grizzlies. VJ Edgecombe had a standout moment for the 76ers, as he scored the game-winning three-pointer. It was Tyrese Maxey who made the decisive pass, which led to the game winner, further cementing their status as a top backcourt in the Eastern Conference.\n\nAfter the win against the Grizzlies, the 76ers are now up to fifth in the Eastern Conference standings. They are on the same number of losses as the fourth-seeded Toronto Raptors, but the Canadian team has played three more games compared to Philly. With how the 76ers played against the Grizzlies, they could go further up the standings.\n\nAs the 76ers' head coach, Nick Nurse has set his team up well for success. He has persisted with Edgecombe as a starter alongside Maxey, which is already paying off. It is still Edgecombe's rookie season, but he is playing like a seasoned veteran. That is huge for the 76ers because not only are they playing well, but they appear to be a good fit alongside each other.\n\nThis is good for the present, but also the long-term future. Edgecombe has the potential to be one of the best shooting guards in the league. Maxey is arguably a top-two guard in the Eastern Conference, so getting a running mate is huge. Considering the 76ers still have Joel Embiid and Paul George, they have a good mix of promising players, stars, and veterans.\n\nMore: VJ Edgecombe hits game-winning shot in overtime\n\nMoving forward, the 76ers have a reliable group of players with Maxey, Edgecombe, and Embiid. George can be a mixed bag, but he does have the resume to deserve to be one of the top players. Jared McCain is also on the roster, and he might not be as prominent as his rookie year, but he has the potential to be a long-term piece.\n\n\"First thing, it was nice to see those guys get rhythm up top for a good stretch of the game with their guard-to-guard screen, turned the corner a couple of times, and when they put two on the ball, we kicked it back out, made the right read... It's a big shot, game-winner for a rookie, pretty cool,\" Nurse said about the dynamic between Maxey and Edgecombe.\n\nAs the season progresses, Edgecombe will continue to get reps as one of the most reliable players on the 76ers roster. For a rookie, that is rare, but Edgecombe has enough talent and bravery to keep succeeding in Philly.\n\nNurse has done well to make everyone feel good in their roles, and Edgecombe is probably the happiest one. He is only a rookie, but he has shown that he is ready for the pressure, and he will continue to stand out amidst all the responsibilities he has with the 76ers.\n\nTyrese Maxey, Joel Embiid, and Paul George win their first game as a trio in 76ers' OT victory\n\nMark Daigneault reflects on Paul George's time playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nWarriors predicted to make trade for $97 million 'game-changer'\n\nNBA trade rumors: Ranking 9 most likely stars to be traded, from Giannis Antetokounmpo to Anthony Davis\n\nDraymond Green compares what makes Michael Porter Jr. more dangerous on the Nets",

    "fullText": "It wasn’t pretty, but early balance by the San Diego State Aztecs gave way to a finishing flourish led by BJ Davis in an 81-68 win over the San José State Spartans on Tuesday night at the Provident Credit Union Event Center.\n\nA season removed from needing a pair of comebacks, having fallen behind by as much as 21 at Viejas Arena and 17 in Silicon Valley, the Aztecs (8-4, 2-0 Mountain West) led the Spartans (5-8, 0-2)  for the vast majority of the game but it never felt fully comfortable until late.\n\nDavis went into attack mode in the second half, scoring 15 of his 18 points, while Pharaoh Compton came off the bench to score 11 points with an SDSU-high six rebounds. Miles Byrd added 11 points with four steals and Reese Dixon-Waters scored 10 points with a pair of late triples to salt the result.\n\nWearing their alternate scarlet uniforms, the Aztecs defense put the stop sign up in the second half down the stretch. Top scorer Colby Garland knocked down a jumper to make it a 2-point game with 8:52 remaining, but that would be the only SJSU bucket until a layup with 26.8 second left and the game decided.\n\nThe San Diego State closing push came in the final five minutes, as Davis scored 8 of the Aztecs' points in a row and and 10 of 12 points over a three minute stretch where a 63-59 lead ballooned to a 75-62 advantage.\n\nOver the final 13 minutes, San Diego State held the Spartans into 2-of-16 shooting, regularly forcing late shot clock shots from the perimeter and allowing just five offensive rebounds and 7 second chance points in the last 20 minutes. SJSU managed only 17 points from the field and 13 points at the free throw line in the second half.\n\nThe opening 20 saw the teams combine for 23 turnovers, with the Aztecs forcing 13 giveaways by the Spartans — 10 on which came in the first 12 minutes.\n\nA 10-0 run just over four and a half minutes into the game gave SDSU an early lead, but San José State put together a 9-0 run of their own over a 1:11 stretch just past the eight minute mark to stay within shouting distance for the remainder of the half.\n\nBalance was the word of the opening 20 minutes for the Scarlet and Black, as all 11 players had at least one field goal, with Magoon Gwath’s 7 points the most on the squad. That balance was also reflected on the glass, as every player had at least two rebounds, and additionally seven players recorded at least one assist.\n\nGwath was called for a technical foul in the first half, tossing the ball in frustration in the direction of Japhet Moupadele after the Spartan had fouled him to send the SDSU forward to the line for one-and-one. Gwath missed the front end and went to the bench, before playing the final 98 seconds of the first half and then played just six minutes in the second stanza.\n\nOutside of a game-high 30 points from Garland, the Spartans got 13 points from Melvin Bell Jr. and 10 points from Jermaine Washington, but the trio shot 14-of-42 from the field. San Diego State held SJSU to 34.5% shooting, though the hosts were able to stay in the game for much of the second half thanks to making 13-of-15 at the charity stripe.\n\nThis is the final Mountain West meeting between the Aztecs and Spartans, as due to the unbalanced schedule SJSU will not be making the trip to The Mesa this season. San Diego State won 22 of the 23 meetings between the programs in the Mountain West era.\n\nSDSU returns home to host the Boise State Broncos at 7 p.m. on Saturday, January 3 at Viejas Arena. The game will be televised on CBS Sports Network, with radio coverage provided locally on San Diego Sports 760 AM.",

    "description": "Salem Hills topped Juan Diego 57-50 on Tuesday, giving them their ninth straight win.",
    "fullText": "It was do-or-die for Salem Hills following its third quarter with Juan Diego on Tuesday. The Skyhawks led by five at halftime, but were outscored 20-8 in the third quarter to give the Soaring Eagles a seven-point lead.\n\nWith its back against the wall, Salem Hills pulled out a 12-0 run in the final four minutes for a 57-50 road win over Juan Diego.\n\nSalem Hills lost its first three games of the season, but Tuesday’s win now makes nine consecutive victories for the Skyhawks.\n\n“I think we believe in the culture that we have, and we believe in the players that we have, and we know the kind of team we had,” said Salem Hills head coach Blake Francom. “So, it was just believing in the process and believing in each other, that was the big thing.”\n\nIt was that continuity that gave the Skyhawks their halftime lead. Juan Diego plays fast and utilizes its size and athleticism in transition, but Salem Hills managed to slow the pace and get the ball into the half-court.\n\nOne of the biggest issues Salem Hills had to deal with was Juan Diego’s Deng Deng. At 6-foot-8, Deng has already racked up more than 45 blocks this season and is second in the state in total blocks. He had four in the first quarter alone.\n\nWhile Deng helped protect the inside, Salem Hills still managed to get quality shots, particularly from Elijah Gasser, who led the team with 17 points.\n\n“(The message was) not to be scared of him, not shy away,” Gasser said. “Shot-fake, bump into him, create some contact in space and go up strong and finish over him. He blocked a lot of shots; he’s tall and long, but don’t let him affect our other shots.”\n\nSalem Hills moved the ball around and stayed disciplined, but Juan Diego’s strength in transition kept it a five-point game at halftime.\n\nThe third quarter is when things started to fall apart for the Skyhawks.\n\nThe Soaring Eagles struggled from beyond the arc in the first half and didn’t make a single 3-pointer until right before halftime. That changed in the third quarter as Juan Diego hit four 3-pointers, including two from Sam Vansice, to take a 43-36 lead.\n\nThings weren’t going well offensively either for Salem Hills. They weren’t getting many shots in rhythm, and Juan Diego started to set the pace.\n\n“I think the crux of it was we just were really inefficient offensively, which affected what we did defensively, which shouldn’t happen,” Francom said. “A lot of, just, miscommunications. We were late to guys we know are shooters, and then a couple guys that haven’t been great shooters made some threes, too. That happens when you let a team get some flow and some rhythm.”\n\nThe beginning of the fourth quarter was more equal, which wasn’t going to get Salem Hills any closer to a win. It wasn’t until the last few minutes of the quarter that the Skyhawks made a strong defensive stand.\n\nThe swing of momentum was largely thanks to hustle plays, many of which came from center Steven Taylor. Taylor had an offensive rebound with a put-back, took a charge and had a steal with a layup, all in the final minutes.\n\nGasser also had a big momentum-swinging play with a steal-and-scoop late in the game.\n\n“I think it really started on the defensive end, and we were able to turn defense into offense and get a few layups,” Gasser said. “We had a couple of guys hit big shots, and we were able to hit free throws down the stretch.”\n\nIn all, Salem Hills kept Juan Diego scoreless through the final four minutes while it went on a 12-0 run for its ninth consecutive win.\n\n“The whole group had, just, tremendous toughness,” Francom said. “Steven (Taylor) obviously had a really difficult matchup with Deng. Deng’s a super tall, athletic kid and Steven made some huge plays down the stretch. All of our guys played tough, and I’m just super proud of the toughness.”",

    "fullText": "The Washington State Cougar fans showed up in droves to support their team in Seattle, making up a majority of the fans in attendance, but left with their heads hanging low as the Seattle Redhawks defended their city in a 69-55 win.\n\nWSU (6-9 overall, 1-1 in conference play) could never overcome their disastrous offensive first half. In the first 20 minutes of play, the Cougars scored just .688 points per possession and turned the ball over 11 times. While they were able to bounce back for a better second half, their efforts weren’t enough to match SU (12-3, 1-1).\n\nOpportunities were aplenty for WSU. They rebounded extremely well, hauling in 49% of their misses for offensive rebounds and limiting the Redhawks to grabbing just 6.5% of their own misses. WSU also got to the line a decent amount but finished only cashing 56.5% of their foul shots.\n\nAfter a brief series of turnovers and missed shots in the first three minutes, Tomas Thrastarson opened the scoring up with a little floater. On the defensive end, the Cougars kept the Redhawks silent through the first media timeout, not allowing a point until Will Heimbrodt’s layup 4:28 into the game.\n\nThe Cougars controlled things down low early. N.D. Okafor patrolled the post defensively, swatting away a pair of shots within the first five minutes. Offensively, the Cougars were all over the offensive glass, grabbing five offensive rebounds early. Despite their presence down low, WSU wasn’t able to convert their early O-boards into points. While able to grab 13 offensive rebounds in the first half, they only converted that into three points.\n\nWSU’s rebounding and defensive efforts were sound, but the offense struggled to find any sort of rhythm after those early makes. A miserable 32.4% turnover rate, combined with an even worse 21.9% shooting from the floor in the first half from WSU, allowed the Redhawks to rally from their own early offensive woes. The Cougars’ early five-point edge quickly vanished as the Redhawks put together mini runs of six, five, four, and eight to match any of the Cougar buckets on the other side of the floor.\n\nThe Redhawks great first half peaked when Brayden Maldonado splashed an open corner three at the buzzer to send Seattle into halftime up 14 points.\n\nWhile the Cougars missed some early chances to gain momentum at the free-throw line, they were still able to cut the deficit to five and finally seize that coveted momentum. Ace Glass was a big factor for the momentum swing, hitting a pair of threes that revived the Cougars’ chances. But those early missed opportunities at the charity stripe and missed open three-pointers loomed large as the Redhawks countered with a 5-0 run to push the lead back into double digits.\n\nThe Cougars finally found their best chance after the under-eight-minute media timeout. Okafor got things going with a putback layup that was followed up with a fast-break layup from Jerone Morton to cut the lead to single digits. After a Redhawk turnover, Glass converted a pair of free throws to bring the deficit to six, which started to bring the Cougar faithful in attendance to life. Okafor capped the run he started with another paint bucket that sent the Cougar fans into a frenzy. Suddenly, as Seattle set up their offense, Climate Pledge Arena sounded like Beasley Coliseum.\n\nThe Redhawks quickly shut up the Cougars with a three-pointer from Maleek Arington, and despite three chances on the other end off of offensive rebounds, the Cougars came away empty. Seattle continued their run with a trio of free throws to push the lead right back up to double digits. Maldonado once again came up clutch with a dagger corner three over Glass. The Redhawk fans reveled and waved goodbye to the Cougar fans making their way for the exits shortly after.\n\nThe first half showcased the worst of this Cougar basketball team. Seemingly endless turnovers and a lack of sharpshooting negated the dominance WSU had in the rebounding effort. By the time they were able to correct some things and find a bit of an offensive groove in the second half, it wasn’t nearly enough to match Seattle. WSU finished with 0.797 points per possession, shooting 29.7% from the floor and 14.8% from beyond the arc. They had ample opportunities to score with 25 offensive rebounds but only converted that into 14 second-chance points. From just a second-chance perspective, they scored just 0.560 points per possession. They also couldn’t convert their opportunities at the free-throw line, hitting only 13-23.\n\nThe Redhawks weren’t exactly burning the nets offensively either. They finished with 1.078 points per possession but also did that while grabbing only two offensive rebounds all night. WSU dominated the glass from the jump and still lost by 14. Tomas Thrastarson also did not play in the second half with what David Riley said was an injury.\n\nThis isn’t a bad loss by any means. This is one of Chris Victor’s best teams he’s put together at Seattle. They will be making a lot of noise in the WCC. But with how many opportunities and open looks the Cougars generated, this one stings for a WSU team looking to snag a win away from home.\n\nWSU will return home to host Loyola Marymount on Friday and Oregon State on Sunday.",

    "fullText": "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has made a sacking comment about a Chelsea coach, but it might not even be far-fetched.\n\nIt comes off the back of Chelsea drawing 2-2 at home against Bournemouth in their final game of 2025 last night in what was another miserable result and performance from The Blues.\n\nEnzo Maresca even dipped out of the press conference after the game due to feeling unwell, even though he had just coached on the side lines all game and was seen out applauding the fans and walking the pitch after the final whilst.\n\nThere were boos and jeers from a pretty big section of Chelsea supporters at full time and after being at Stamford Bridge myself on Saturday in our 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa, I can confirm that this was the second game in a row where you could hear boos at full time. It’s really not good.\n\nEnzo Maresca on the touchline against Newcastle. (Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nEnzo Maresca will be under huge pressure now and I don’t think it’s far-fetched to wonder whether Chelsea might sack him today in the aftermath of this game and recent form. Deep down I don’t think they will, yet, but it’s certainly not impossible.\n\nJamie Carragher though, was not talking about Maresca, he was speaking about Chelsea’s set piece coach and really, it’s a bit of a tongue in cheek comment after Chelsea conceded two goals to long throw ins last night!\n\nCarragher joked that the set-piece coach at Stamford Bridge could receive his marching orders. He said: “Maybe Chelsea will sack their set-piece coach tomorrow as well.”\n\nChelsea’s set piece coach is Bernado Cueva, who they took from Brentford earlier this season of course.",

    "description": "Losing important players to AFCON was an eventuality that was always going to have to be confronted. So far the impact has been limited – let’s hope it continues to be.",
    "fullText": "Sunderland have now played two matches since the departure of most of our AFCON contingent and one without the returning Habib Diarra, who managed a brief cameo against Brighton before jetting off to international duty.\n\nWith so many players missing, this was always going to be a challenging period for any team, let alone a newly promoted side. Some absences have been more keenly felt than others. Reinildo Mandava and Noah Sadiki are the most obvious ones, but I would include Chemsdine Talbi and Bertrand Traoré in that category.\n\nFor me, Reinildo has been the second-most-impactful signing behind Granit Xhaka, and neither Trai Hume nor Dennis Cirkin can properly replace his pace, experience, or his ability to drive upfield on the left flank. Unfortunately Mozambique are doing better than expected at AFCON, and we may be without him for longer than originally anticipated if they do progress deeper into the competition.\n\nLutsharel Geertruida has made a decent fist of filling Sadiki’s midfield berth, but when Cirkin closed down Lucas Perri on Sunday afternoon, Sadiki would have occupied the space he left – he has done so all season when Reinildo has ventured forward. Instead that side of the defence was left exposed, allowing Leeds to play the expansive football that led to Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s equaliser.\n\nIt is frustrating watching a talent like Talbi warming the bench in his home country. As a starter or an impact substitute, he has become integral to Régis Le Bris’ system and played a significant part in the team’s success so far. It is only the fact that Adingra and Mundle are there to cover for him that his absence has not been more evident.\n\nBertrand Traoré’s absence has had a greater impact than might have been imagined – he took some time to get into his stride and initially struggled to convince, but sometimes it only becomes apparent how important a player is when they are absent. And Sunderland are struggling to find a way to fill the void that he has left.\n\nOf the players who have been drafted in, Geertruida and Simon Adingra have both shown their value. Geertruida has been tidy and industrious without quite bringing the energy and dynamism that Sadiki delivers. He certainly doesn’t look out of place as a Premier League midfielder.\n\nAdingra wasn’t up to speed against his old side last weekend but was much improved against Leeds. His goal may have been the highlight, but it was his defensive work-rate which appeared much improved from his showings earlier in the season. He certainly didn’t shirk a tackle, as Joe Rodon will testify!\n\nElsewhere, Chris Rigg has struggled to fill the gap that Traoré has left – it isn’t a position that best suits his skillset, and he still looks a little lightweight and too easily dispossessed at this level, although his defending was much more tenacious against Leeds. Would Mayenda’s ability to hold the ball up and turn defenders offer a better option?\n\nDennis Cirkin was understandably a little ring-rusty but did show signs that he can replicate the form that he showed in the Championship at Premier League level. But with his contract situation still unresolved and Reinildo possibly away for a couple more weeks, there are still questions to be answered.\n\nSo far, the AFCON collapse that rival fans were eagerly anticipating hasn’t yet materialised – two points from two games is not to be dismissed – but Régis Le Bris still has plenty to contend with. And his considerations have been complicated by the injury to Dan Ballard.\n\nWith fixtures against Manchester City, Tottenham, Brentford, and Crystal Palace in the next three weeks, the French coach has problems to solve. Whether he is able to find solutions within the squad currently at his disposal and whatever additions may arrive in the New Year will determine whether his side can maintain their lofty position in the Premier League.\n\nLosing important players to AFCON was an eventuality that was always going to have to be confronted. So far the impact has been limited – let’s hope it continues to be.",

    "fullText": "Next time Sunderland step out at the Stadium of Light, it’ll be 2026, but what a year 2025 has been.\n\nTwelve months ago, if someone said that Sunderland would finish the year inside the top ten of the Premier League, you would ask how many festive drinks you’d had.\n\nThe reality is we are — and what a year.\n\nMoving forward into 2026, the transfer window is a challenge that’ll cause debate among the fans: do we stick or twist?\n\nIn sticking, we’d go with majority of the squad we have knowing we’re more than capable of finishing in the top half with money to invest in the summer, or do we take the gamble and shift a few out —which would include fan favourites like Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson — and spend £100 million more in a push for a top six finish?\n\nFor me, it’s worth that gamble now.\n\nThis squad may never get a better chance of European football but it’s a squad that needs improvement to achieve those goals.\n\nHappy New Year — and Haway the Lads!\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Mark. Thank you for your letter.\n\nThis is the dilemma the club faces, isn’t it?\n\nWe’re heading into 2026 in a wonderful position and hopefully ideally positioned to attract some real quality in January, but of course there are financial restrictions within which we have to operate and I don’t see the club taking any undue risks — even though the rewards could be significant.\n\nI don’t think the squad needs a major overhaul this month — two or three top quality additions should hopefully be enough to see us through to the end of the campaign and hopefully a top ten finish — which would set us up for what could be yet another exciting summer.\n\nLet’s see how it pans out in January!\n\nHope we go for a proven striker and not someone who hits the net occasionally.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Ian. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nI must admit that I’d love to see a “natural” finisher at Sunderland — similar to Dominic Calvert-Lewin at Leeds United — and I have a feeling the club will be zeroing in on this area next month.\n\nWe’re in a very strong position in the league but goals are proving hard to come by at the moment, so it’s certainly something worth considering and it’ll be interesting to see how our centre forward options look when the window closes.",

    "title": "On This Day (31st Dec 1976): Adamson’s Delight As Doc Signs For Sunderland!",
    "description": "Not long in the hotseat at Sunderland, Jimmy Adamson made a key signing and was delighted to get his man in Mick Docherty, a player whom he was a long-time admirer of.",
    "fullText": "I was completely underwhelmed by the £10,000 signing of full-back come midfielder Mick Docherty from Man City on the last day of 1976.\n\nWe were in dire straits at the bottom of the First Division and looking like we were going straight back down to the second tier, having fought so long and hard under Bob Stokoe to get promoted.\n\nThe resignation of Stokoe due to ill health had generally shocked the fanbase despite our difficulties. The appointment of Adamson had not been universally welcomed, and results as well as performances had not improved.\n\nI felt the often publicly dour Ashington-born but steeped in Burnley FC man needed a marquee signing to get us all believing again. A bargain-basement journeyman who could not get a game at his previous club was hardly the signing to get us off our seats!\n\nIt would not take too long for Mick Docherty to change my and many others in the fanbase’s opinion, with his combative, hard-working performances allied to a really sharp sense of the game and a natural ability to lead. By the time he had to retire from playing because of injury he would arguably sit in the top five pound-for-pound best-ever signings I have ever seen in coming up to sixty years of watching Sunderland AFC!\n\nMick Docherty started his career at Chelsea as an apprentice in 1966. His father, the legendary Tommy Docherty, was the manager and surprised – maybe even shocked – Mick at the time by arranging an “apprentice transfer” to Burnley. Two hundred miles away from the family home, young Docherty wondered what he had done to deserve to be “sent to Burnley”. However, at this period the Clarets had a premier reputation for fashioning and moulding young players through such coaches as Alan Brown, Harry Potts, and Jimmy Adamson.\n\nDocherty would quickly make his mark, becoming the first-ever Burnley Youth-team captain to lift the FA Youth Cup in the 1967/68 season. Burnley’s victory in this season interrupted a run by Sunderland whose Youth team were beaten finalists in 1965/66, winners in 1966/67 and 1968/69. Alan Brown is hugely credited with being the architect of Sunderland’s successes during this period in bringing through so many good young players.\n\nFormer Burnley player Jimmy Adamson was a coach at Burnley when Mick Docherty joined the club. He was a coach with a huge reputation in the game, having assisted England manager Walter Winterbottom in the 1962 World Cup and been the preferred choice of the FA in front of Alf Ramsey to take the national team forward to the 1966 World Cup tournament. Adamson had declined the offer, preferring to concentrate on developing his career in the club game.\n\nAt this point in his career Docherty was a hard-working ball-winner and midfielder who won four England Youth caps before making his debut for Burnley in December 1968.\n\nInitially playing in midfield, Docherty went on to make one hundred and fifty-three appearances for the Clarets between 1968 and May 1976. Jimmy Adamson had taken over as first-team manager from February 1970, and Docherty was a trusted player and became an on-field leader in his Burnley team over this period.\n\nDocherty was a key part of the Burnley squad who won the Second Division championship in 1973 led by Jimmy Adamson. By this point Adamson had converted Docherty into a very good right-back. Unfortunately “young Doc” sustained torn knee ligaments coming into the closing stages of that campaign. He rehabbed well and was fit for the start of the next season in the top tier. But in the very first game he was stretchered off with cruciate and medial ligament injury in the same knee. Despite once again rehabbing well and regaining his place in the team, this injury would come back to plague him and eventually force his premature retirement from playing.\n\nThe dismissal of Jimmy Adamson from his post at Burnley in January 1976 also quickly saw Docherty lose his place in the first team as new manager Joe Brown cleared out a lot of the previous regime’s players. Man City manager Tony Book snapped Docherty up for the start of the 1976/77 campaign.\n\nJimmy Adamson meanwhile had gone to Sparta Rotterdam as their manager for the 1976/77 season but was offered the Sunderland post in November 1976 and found the lure of managing back in the English top tier and back in his native North-East too hard to resist.\n\nDocherty had only played eleven games for Man City when his former boss came in for him to renew their working relationship.\n\nSigned too late to play in the New Year’s Day game at Liverpool (which was a shame as I travelled to that game and saw us well beaten by two goals to nil), Doc makes his debut for Sunderland three days later in a bottom-of-the-table clash at Roker Park against Coventry.\n\nPlaying at right-back and made captain his impact was immediate. Snapping into tackles and using the ball sharply, his presence appeared to bring a bit of confidence to a team on a seven-game losing run who had not scored a goal for six games.\n\nDespite his impact we lost that game to a 90th-minute goal which was to a degree how the season had been going!\n\nA loss in our next league game at Leicester saw youngsters Kevin Arnott and Shaun Elliott join Gary Rowell in the team, with another young player Alan Brown on the bench. Elliott had to leave the field injured on fifty-six minutes and with our sub already on we played the game a man down for the last thirty-four minutes, but the improved performance continued.\n\nTwo hard-fought 0-0 draws at Arsenal and home to Stoke City followed. The team was fighting, and Docherty was right at the heart of this, leading from the front!\n\nThen on a dark, cold, and wet Friday night in February we scrapped a 1-0 victory with a Mel Holden goal against Bristol City. This ended an eleven-game run in the league without a win and ten league games without scoring a goal.\n\nWhat followed was almost unbelievable given what had preceded it as we scored sixteen goals in three games and went on a run to the end of the season that saw us lose only three games, drawing five and winning nine. It was one of my favourite periods supporting the Lads as we almost did the impossible and saved ourselves from what had been certain relegation at the end of January. The three youngsters who had come into the team known as “Charlie’s Angels” (after the scout Charlie Ferguson who had brought all three into the club) were a massive part of this turnaround and earned rave reviews for their performances. Quietly, almost subtly in the background, Mick Docherty was working his oracle – cajoling and supporting, leading and performing.\n\nMick Docherty brought simplicity to his game. He was tigerish in just about any tackle and had a good knack of staying on his feet. He was pacey and had a sharp turn. His passing was uncomplicated and accurate, and he matched all of this with a very good engine that played ninety-plus minutes every game. He also led from the front; he was in every sense a guy to go to war with!\n\nHe started season 1977/78 at right-back, but early on into the season a recurrence of his knee injury means he did not get back till 31st December for a tough 0-0 draw at his previous club Burnley. Apart from the game being extremely hard-fought, the other noticeable feature is he starts the game in midfield alongside Bobby Kerr, Kevin Arnott, and Wilf Rostron and puts in a man-of-the-match performance.\n\nThe difficult start to the season with Adamson moving on many of Bob Stokoe’s team put paid to any chances of promotion that campaign, but there is enough to suggest in a sixth-place finish that the following season could bear fruit if we have a better run of injuries.\n\nThe 1978/79 campaign had some memorable moments in it, and Doc played twenty-eight games scoring six goals in the centre of midfield.\n\nA game that I will always remember and associate with him in particular was the match that came to be called “the Battle of Turf Moor”. Everything that Mick Docherty brought to a team was on display in this game. With both full-backs unjustly sent off in my opinion, we go in at half-time drawing 0-0 but facing the prospect of playing the second half with just nine men!\n\nEx-Burnley manager, coach, and player Jimmy Adamson appears to have found this all too much, bursting into the dressing room and telling his team they were a “disgrace” and that they now “had their excuse for losing the game” before storming out slamming the door.\n\nIt is Mick Docherty that breaks the silence saying “I am not having that” as he leads the plan to surprise Burnley by attacking for the first fifteen minutes of the second half.\n\nThe plan works with two Gary Rowell goals (including one penalty). However it is the performance of the nine players on the pitch in a game Sunderland legend Gary Rowell described as the most violent he ever played in that stands out. I was at that game and Mick Docherty along with Shaun Elliott and Barry Siddall were out of this world, with the other six Sunderland players being simply brilliant!\n\nUnfortunately this season too saw Docherty miss much of the season from November to March as the knee injury impacted.\n\nJimmy Adamson had left four games after the “Battle of Turf Moor” to manage Leeds. Long-serving Billy Elliott was in temporary charge with Ken Knighton his coach. Docherty was an important conduit and influence both on and off the pitch this season as he played twenty-eight games scoring six goals again from midfield. The season went down to the final game with Sunderland winning at Wrexham. I stood on the Wrexham terrace waiting on the Stoke result to come through. If we had bettered their result (at Notts County) we were promoted. They had scored a late winner and it was a major disappointment and a very long journey home for us. Few of us knew that in the dressing room a once-again injured Mick Docherty had played his last competitive game. He had poured everything into that match and given his all for the cause, but the medial and cruciate ligament injury was not going to allow him to play again at the age of twenty-nine!\n\nSeason 1979/80 surprisingly saw Ken Knighton and not Billy Elliott given the manager’s post. Docherty, already qualified as a coach, was given a role within the club and played his part behind the scenes in a fantastic promotion to the top tier.\n\nThe following season (1980/81) was difficult for Knighton, especially given his relationship with chairman Tom Cowie. With results not going their way and fears of relegation, Cowie sacks Knighton and places Docherty in charge for the last four games. He manages to steer the team to two wins including an amazing 1-0 victory at Anfield courtesy of a Stan Cummins goal as relegation is avoided.\n\nHe became part of Alan Durban’s coaching team for the next two seasons before trying his hand in the manager’s role at Hartlepool for eighteen months. His pedigree though is as a coach, and he enjoys spells at Burnley, Huddersfield, and Hull to name but three in a coaching career of almost forty years.\n\nI always thought Sunderland as a club suited him. He was everything we like in a player – committed, skilful, hard, and clever. His record of seventy-nine games and eight goals was eventful as well as hard-won. I firmly believe that but for injury Mick Docherty would have built an even more obvious legacy at Sunderland.\n\nEvery team needs a Mick Docherty!",

    "title": "Could A “Natural” Finisher Be On Sunderland’s January Shopping List?",
    "description": "After encountering a prolific striker in fine form on Sunday, could Sunderland sign a similar player next month?",
    "fullText": "When Dominic Calvert-Lewin ghosted into the box to slot home a deserved Leeds equaliser on Sunday afternoon, it was hard not to be impressed with both the ease of the finish and the quality of the visitors’ build up play.\n\nOK, a Sunderland defensive lapse opened the door for the visitors but the former Everton centre forward — blessed with superb mobility, awareness and finishing instincts — is currently on a white-hot streak in front of goal and assuming Leeds can keep him fit, blessed with reliable service and therefore amongst the goals, it’s fair to say they’ll have very little to worry about when it comes to the relegation battle.\n\nWould I have liked Calvert-Lewin or a natural finisher of his ilk to have joined Sunderland last summer? Arguably, yes, but you just know that if we’d taken a punt on him as a free agent, his hamstring would’ve gone “twang” after two training sessions and the dreaded “six to eight weeks” prognosis would’ve been wheeled out, such is our misfortune with injuries.\n\nStill, more power to Daniel Farke’s side for deciding that Calvert-Lewin was worth a shot, and as he continued his impressive renaissance following several injury-interrupted campaigns, it was a tale of “what might’ve been” for Sunderland’s first-choice striker.\n\nBrian Brobbey didn’t play badly by any means on Sunday.\n\nHis physical presence caused the visiting defence issues all afternoon and had a powerful header from an accurate Simon Adingra cross dipped under the crossbar, the entire dynamic would’ve been different.\n\nGenerally speaking, I do feel he’s made a positive impression since joining the club, and if he can just sharpen up a touch in front of goal, he could easily finish the season with ten league strikes — by no means a poor return for a debutant.\n\nHowever, if Brobbey’s industry and work rate are proving effective, the mercurial Wilson Isidor is finding the going much tougher.\n\nHis barren streak in front of goal is showing no signs of ending, whilst Eliezer Mayenda’s regression from playoff hero to fringe attacker (ironically, he looked extremely lively and arguably most likely to make something happen when he came on against Leeds) has been difficult to fathom, so the red and white strike force is something of a talking point right now.\n\nSunderland’s relatively minor goal threat from our strikers and our promising league position may be jarring to the “statistics are everything” brigade, but they aren’t one and the same.\n\nFortunately, we’ve been able to spread the goals around — Adingra himself becoming the latest player on the roll call after a sumptuous assist from Granit Xhaka on Sunday — and combined with our no-nonsense attitude and wholehearted approach to defending, it’s enabled us to remain very much on course for a top ten finish. That’s not a matter of luck — it’s a result of superb organisation, resilience and nous.\n\nThat said, can you ever have “too much” firepower at your disposal?\n\nAssuming — as was hinted at by Régis Le Bris last week — that Mayenda is loaned out next month, will we seek to fill the subsequent vacancy with more of a predatory finisher; someone for whom a half-chance represents an excellent opening and can convert opportunities that come their way with dead-eye reliability?\n\nAfter a summer during which we unearthed several gems in the transfer market, the odds of lightning striking again in the form of a prolific centre forward may be lengthy, but if we truly want to make a statement during our first season back in the Premier League, such a move could make a big difference.\n\nI do feel that as a whole, the balance is heavily tilted towards being solid, steady and hard to break down, and that we could pose more of an attacking threat if we were that way inclined. That said, I also fully accept that Le Bris’ pragmatism has enabled us to compete very strongly and has had an incredibly positive impact — something that’s reflected in our current league position.\n\nIt’s process; an ongoing puzzle, and something that we’re clearly working on, so it’ll be interesting to see what happens in this regard during the transfer window.\n\nIn terms of our current options, Brobbey is a workhorse, Isidor is a magician and Mayenda is a talented if raw prospect. Nobody could knock their attitude and application, and all three could become fine Premier League players in time.\n\nHowever, we faced a predatory striker on Sunday and we’ll be coming up against a stone-cold assassin tomorrow night in the shape of Erling Haaland. If Sunderland want to continue to build on what’s been a highly promising season so far, perhaps looking at other clubs for inspiration may not be the worst idea in the world.",

    "description": "Move over, Spotify wrapped — we take a look back at the year that made Sunderland history.",
    "fullText": "2025 can be etched into the history books as one of Sunderland AFC’s greatest years and made up of the things that football fans can only dream of: promotions, very few home defeats, final-minute goals, and beating the winner of the Club World Cup. Move over, 1973, there’s a new legacy in town; imagine telling yourself at Christmas in 2024 that Sunderland would be ending 2025 in 7th in the Premier League.\n\nWe’ve been fortunate this year in that our first and last matches took place at the Stadium of Light. From winning 2-1 against Sheffield United on the 1st Jan 2025, to then beating them in the Playoff Final, Sunderland really did battle ‘Til the End’.\n\nWins: 20 Draws: 14 Losses: 19 Goals scored: 56 Goals conceded: 58\n\n2025 gave us 25 glorious matches at the Stadium of Light, supporting our incredible team with the ferocious atmosphere that can only be provided by the armada of Sunderland fans that we bring to every home fixture. Of those 25 home games, only SEVEN of them were losses. Talk about value for money on your season ticket.\n\nSeeing 20 wins and 19 losses doesn’t look too believable when you consider how spectacularly well we’ve done this year, but 5 of those losses came from club friendlies over the summer. We really know when to bring our A-game. On top of that, 3 of our draws in 2025 occurred against clubs who finished in the top 6 of the Premier League in the 2024-25 season.\n\nSignings: 18 Combined cost: £151,000,000 (approx) Loans: 4 Free transfers: 2\n\n2025 has been a big year for Sunderland signings. It felt like we were making a new signing almost every day over the summer, and that shows in our stats. Starting with Enzo in January, there have been some incredible moves made to Wearside.\n\nWith an approximate combined cost of £151 million for our 18 new players, our position on the Premier League table just shows how much ‘trust the process’ should be our new motto. For context, when Isak left the mags, he cost Liverpool £125 mil. And you know what’s happened since.\n\nOur greatest moment in Spring wasn’t necessarily one that put points on the table but, moreso, consisted of more legendary behaviour from a true Mackem. That’s right, our best moment in Spring was Luke O’Nien taking out the linesman and waving his flag. There is so much more to Sunderland than just statistics, and our club captain is the one who proves this time and time again.\n\nMay deserves its own section in our best bits because it was such an incredible month for Sunderland. Dan Ballard’s incredible 121:59 header in the home leg against Coventry, which sent us straight to the Play-Off finals, will stay in the memories of so many Mackems for years to come. Arguably the most iconic moment of 21st-century Sunderland, but we’ll ask you again in a couple of years.\n\nThe end of May saw us winning the final at Wembley Stadium in one hell of an emotional rollercoaster. That day proved so many wrong and proved to the masses that Sunderland were right back where we deserved to be.\n\nWe can talk endlessly about Sunderland’s summer signings. Unlike lots of newly promoted teams, we took risks. Where other teams saw AFCON liabilities, we saw players with incredible potential and passion for the club. We plucked captain Xhaka out of nowhere in an extremely unexpected transfer, creating an amazing buzz around our first season back in the Premier League. However, nothing truly came close to the feeling of seeing us at the top of the Premier League table for those few glorious hours after our opening 3-0 win against West Ham in our first game of the season.\n\nOne of the first major signs that Sunderland are a force to be reckoned with was that 2-1 away win over Chelsea in October. From finishing 4th in the Championship to beating the Club World Cup winners at their home ground just a few months later, Sunderland spent Autumn skyrocketing into the big leagues, and proving that they were here to stay.\n\nOf course, the Wear-Tyne derby has to be our Winter highlight. Mind the gap. In a scenario none of us could have predicted, even the Visitors wanted us to win, allowing St Nick to deliver a header of a present to all of us on that cold day in December. And, on top of all of that, we have finished the year 2 points off 5th place. Not a bad way to spend your year.",

    "fullText": "Jacob Rodriguez position change: How Texas Tech star went from QB recruit to All-American linebacker originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Texas Tech Red Raiders are making their first-ever College Football Playoff debut, set to take on the Oregon Ducks in the Orange Bowl quarterfinal matchup.\n\nA big reason for Tech's success this season is how well linebacker Jacob Rodriguez has been playing. He leads the Red Raiders in tackles with 117 total stops on the year, and has helped lead Texas Tech into an elite defense this season.\n\nBut what you may not know about the veteran linebacker is that he actually only started playing defense once he got to Texas Tech in 2022, previously starting his career at Virginia as an offensive player.\n\nLet's take a look at how Rodriguez transformed his college career, moving from offense to defense.\n\nMORE:History behind Texas Tech's tortilla-throwing tradition\n\nRodriguez attended Rider High School in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he played both quarterback and free safety. Per his Texas Tech bio, he passed for 7,085 yards with 68 touchdowns, adding 3,051 yards and 38 touchdowns on the ground. His high school made two trips to the  Class 5A Division II state semifinals during his sophomore and senior seasons.\n\nPer his 247Sports recruiting page, Rodrigues also played basketball and participated in the long jump, triple jump and relays for his track and field team.\n\nMORE:Revisiting Patrick Mahomes' Texas Tech career\n\nGiven his multi-position background in high school, he was listed as an athlete by 247Sports. The outlet listed him as a 3-star, ranked as the No. 26 athlete from the class of 2021.\n\nHe received offers from a number of power-conference schools, such as Baylor, Houston, Indiana, Kansas State, Iowa State and Virginia. He committed to the Cavaliers' 2021 class in April 2020 and remained committed up through his Dec. signing. Despite other schools wanting him to play defense, UVA actually recruited Rodriguez as a quarterback.\n\n“That had a little effect on my decision,” Rodriguez said in April 2020 via the Times Record News. “Beyond playing football, I want to go into coaching. I feel like learning the quarterback position at the college level gives me a better understanding of play calls and how to learn how to do things as a whole on offense.\"\n\nBut once he got to Virginia, he was utilized at a number of positions on offense, including receiver and fullback. He appeared in all 12 games as a true freshman, getting eight receptions for 65 yards and a touchdown with another 10 carries for 56 yards on the ground.\n\nHe played behind UVA quarterback Brennan Armstrong, who broke single-season records for the Cavaliers in 2021.\n\nPer a recent ESPN feature on Rodriguez, UVA coaches told him they planned to make him into the next Taysom Hill. But his time in Charlottesville lasted just one season, as he entered the transfer portal in Dec. 2021 after UVA head coach Bronco Mendenhall abruptly resigned after six seasons as the Cavs head coach.\n\nMORE:Picks, predictions  for 2025 CFP quarterfinal games\n\nRodriguez entered the portal largely because of Mendenhall leaving.\n\n\"I loved it there and loved the people there,\" Rodriguez said via ESPN of his time at Virginia. \"But I kind of went there to play for him.\"\n\nTexas Tech head coach Joey McGuire, who had recruited Rodriguez in high school while he was at Baylor, offered Rodriguez a spot on the team as a walk-on, but was placed on scholarship before the 2022 season.\n\nPrior to him transferring to Texas Tech, the Red Raiders coaches informed him he would not be joining as a quarterback. Although it took some time, Rodriguez started figuring out the defensive side of things in 2022.\n\n\"Really just knowing that I can make an impact whatever position I play,\" Rodriguez said via NWA Online of the position change. \"I've done it on the offensive side of the ball, I've done it on the defensive side of a ball, and I've done it on special teams. I can really play with anybody,\" he said. \"That's kind of when I figured I can do this. I saw myself progressing a lot on the defensive side of the ball, and week to week just getting better and better.\"\n\nLOOK:Texas Tech's 'Too-Cold' uniforms\n\nRodriguez finished with a combined 59 total tackles during his first two seasons at linebacker. But you can see the huge numbers he's put up during his junior and senior seasons:\n\nUnsurprisingly, Rodriguez cleaned up during the college football awards season. Here's a look at each award he took home:\n\nChuck Bednarik Award (nation's top defensive player)\n\nButkus Award (nation's top linebacker)\n\nBronko Nagurski Trophy (nation's top defensive player)\n\nLombardi Award (nation's top lineman or linebacker)\n\nPony Express Award (nation's top duo with David Bailey)\n\nDespite a campaign for him to be a Heisman finalist, was not invited to New York City. Even still, the linebacker impressively finished fifth in Heisman voting, receiving 17 first-place votes.\n\nMORE:Why Michigan landed the perfect replacement for Sherrone Moore in Kyle Whittingham",

Equal reminders both of what could have been this season, had USC ever played at its best for long, and also flashes of why it never managed to come together.\n\nIn one moment, there was true freshman Tanook Hines, sprinting to catch a deep ball in stride, announcing himself as a rising star. In another, a TCU running back was busting his way through tackles on third-and-long, rumbling his way into the end zone, deflating any delusions of grandeur.\n\nBut the final minutes took the Trojans on a tour of all the most glaring concerns from their 2025 season, from the leaky defense to the missed opportunities on offense. USC had led by two scores with less than five minutes remaining, only to see its lead evaporate in that span.\n\nIt got all the way to the five-yard line in overtime, but failed to punch in, settling for a field goal that would spell its demise.\n\nThough, it didn’t seem to be headed that way as TCU faced a third and 20, with its hopes hanging in the balance. Quarterback Ken Seals simply dumped it off to his running back, Jeremy Payne, and hoped for the best.\n\nHe got it, all while dealing the Trojans a nightmarish conclusion in the process.\n\nPayne broke one tackle, then another, then another, rumbling his way 35 yards until he’d scored a walk-off touchdown, leaving USC with a 9-4 record and bitter taste in its mouth heading into the offseason.\n\nThere had been multiple chances throughout for USC to put the game away, just like there had been multiple chances in each of the Trojans’ four losses this season.\n\nAnd now, USC faces a litany of questions unanswered, not the least of which being what direction will USC take its defense, after coordinator D’Anton Lynn departed for Penn State just before the game.\n\nUSC certainly played like it had lost its coordinator and half of its starters on that side of the ball, giving up 144 yards in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe questions raised Tuesday, however, did not include how USC might replace its No. 1 wideout next season. Hines had already done his part to earn that role, but declared it to the world with a six-catch, 163-yard performance.\n\nKing Miller offered similar confidence in the future of USC’s rushing attack, running for 99 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBut they may have been the only two. Jayden Maiava, who will return next season, completed 18 of 30 passes for 280 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nUSC was already facing an uphill climb with its roster, considering over a dozen starters or would-be starters were out for one reason or another. Three of the Trojans’ starting offensive linemen didn’t dress. Both of their top receivers and top tight end were in street clothes, having already declared for the NFL draft. Twenty-five players listed in USC’s two-deep were either freshmen or redshirt freshmen.\n\nThen there was the matter of being without their defensive coordinator. Lynn left the team a day after he officially took the same job at Penn State. The decision for Lynn not to coach the bowl was described to The Times as “a mutual agreement”. But his absence left USC to entrust defensive line coach Eric Henderson to step into a role he wasn’t expecting.\n\nIt went quite smoothly at first. USC held TCU to two straight three-and-outs — and just 11 total yards in two drives — to open the game.\n\nBut on the ensuing possession, Maiava threw into heavy coverage in the seam. His pass was picked off. The momentum USC had built up dissolved almost instantly.\n\nThe defense’s strong start faded into disarray. TCU turned up the tempo and mounted consecutive touchdown drives. Mistakes piled up for a defense that was relying on inexperienced players at every level. Tackling, which was improved all season, suddenly was a struggle.\n\nTwice, USC stalled after promising drives, deep in TCU territory, leaving it to settle for a pair of first-half field goals and take a 14-13 deficit into halftime.\n\nUSC came out of the locker room looking ready to kick into gear. Linebacker Jadyn Walker tipped a pass deep in TCU territory, and safety Christian Pierce came down with the interception, putting USC in perfect position to capitalize.\n\nUSC handed it right back. With the ball at the seven-yard line, Maiava threw into traffic once again. It was picked off in the end zone.\n\nBut this time, USC’s defense managed to salvage the mistake, forcing a three-and-out, only to find itself on the field again less than 90 seconds later. It got another stop, nonetheless.\n\nMaiava finally made the most of that opportunity. He hit Hines in stride on a 46-yard bomb, then found senior Jaden Richardson in the corner of the end zone for a stunning, one-handed score.\n\nBut TCU refused to go away. The Horned Frogs mounted two scoring drives in the final five minutes, forcing overtime.\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool confirmed on Tuesday December 30 that Aaron Briggs would be leaving the club.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Briggs he was operating in the role of set-piece coach. Having joined the club initially back in summer 2024 - as an individual development coach - Briggs played his part in the Premier League title win under Arne Slot last season.\n\nThe decision was then made to promote Briggs to his set-piece role after a search was put out for candidates on platforms such as LinkedIn.\n\nBut it’s not gone well for the defending Premier League champions nor for Briggs this season.\n\nLiverpool’s goal difference from set-pieces in the top flight this season stands at minus 9 - with 12 goals conceded and only three scored. That is the worst record in any of Europe’s top five leagues.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nIt must be said that their record from set-pieces in the Champions League is much better - standing at five goals scored and none conceded in six matches.\n\nAnd last season Slot credited Briggs with coming up with the solution for at least one goal scored in Europe.\n\nSet-pieces have become a Premier League arms race however with most top clubs boasting a specialist coach.\n\nAround 30 percent of goals in the top flight have been scored via set-pieces this season and it’s clear Liverpool cannot keep up.\n\nResponsibility for set-pieces will now fall onto Arne Slot’s other coaching staff including Sipke Hulshoff and Giovanni van Bronckhorst.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this decision pays off for the Reds - especially in the short term where set-piece experts Leeds United lie in wait.\n\nBut with the announcement of Briggs’ departure it’s clear that the former Manchester City and Wolfsburg coach is carrying the can for the Reds’ adverse position.\n\nThe Anfield side have been blighted by individual errors from set-pieces this season. Their poor record from corners in particular is not down to simply one man.\n\nIndeed there was plenty of evidence that the Reds were suffering from a set-piece syndrome last season - with Slot commenting that Liverpool weren't scoring enough.",

    "title": "A new era of Stack Overflow",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Every year for the last three years, we’ve shared major announcements from the mainstage of WeAreDevelopers World Congress in Berlin at pivotal moments in our journey. In 2023, we launched OverflowAI, our flagship AI initiative for our users and enterprise customers, while last year, we revealed our vision for the Knowledge as a Service model and high-quality, trusted data as the currency that will define the new era of the internet. 2025 so far has been a year marked by significant experimentation and evolution for us as a company and exploration of how we can continue to be of service to the world’s technologists. At the beginning of the year, we along with our Head of Community Philippe Beaudette held our first ever live AMA (‘Ask Me Anything’) session, when we shared our plans to introduce new features and formats of engagement for our users, and hear directly from some of our community members. In that same spirit, today on the WeAreDevelopers stage we unveiled our new vision, mission statement, and the latest product updates for our public platform users and enterprise customers. We wanted to provide a bit of a peek behind the curtain on our future and why Stack Overflow remains the most vital source for technology enthusiasts around the world.\n\nThe Open Web has had many transformations. Since its founding in 2008, Stack Overflow has had a front row seat to myriad shifts in the landscape—from the rise of cloud computing in the early 2010s, the rise of remote work during the pandemic, and now the GenAI era that began in late 2022 that has defined not only the technology industry but changed the face of society, communication, and public life since then. Over the last six months, we’ve approached our evolution with one question: “What’s the future of Stack Overflow in an AI world?” The way that developers, especially ones at the beginning of their professional careers, engage with technology and learn to code is vastly different now in 2025 than in 2008 when our public platform was founded. Not only do technologists turn to a vast array of resources, from AI chat bots, online video platforms, and discussion forums to find solutions to their queries and sharpen their skills, but the very definition of a developer has expanded. With these realities in mind, we’re looking ahead to how we can continue to serve technologists across the globe.\n\nToday onstage, we shared a sneak peek of the findings of our fifteenth annual Developer Survey, our flagship survey that polls our community on all topics important to those who code, which will be released in the next few weeks. We’ve asked our users about their thoughts on and use of AI, and a striking pattern has emerged. For the third year in a row, we've seen the number of developers using AI tools in their workflow continue to increase year over year, with 83% saying they use or plan to use AI tools in their development process this year, an increase over 2024 (76%). However, the lack of trust in AI tools also continues to rise with 46% of respondents saying they do not trust the output of AI, up significantly from 26% last year.\n\nWith the use of AI now ubiquitous and ‘AI slop’ rapidly replacing the content we see online, this trust gap is where we think Stack Overflow can play a role. Our renewed vision and purpose moving forward is to be the world’s most vital source for technologists. By providing a trusted human intelligence layer in the age of AI, we believe we can serve technologists with our mission to cultivate community, power learning, and unlock growth.\n\nStack Overflow’s journey over the years has never been a simple one or easy to define. We’re most known by our origins as a question and answer platform by and for technical experts, but in 2010 we expanded to include B2C offerings with the larger Stack Exchange network and our Careers product to help developers find their next job, followed by our move into the Enterprise in 2018 with Stack Overflow for Teams, our internal version of our public offering to help teams collaborate. Now in the age of AI post 2023, we’ve entered our next phase and recently introduced our Knowledge Solutions offering that partners like OpenAI, Google Cloud, and Moveworks utilize to power their AI solutions with our trusted and accurate corpus of data. With this evolution and the pace of change showing no sign of slowing down, we realized a radical simplification of our brand architecture was in order. Our public platform, including the Stack Exchange network, will now be known simply as Stack Overflow, while Stack Overflow Business will comprise our Ads business, Stack Internal (formerly known as Stack Overflow for Teams), and Stack Data Licensing (formerly known as Knowledge Solutions).\n\nIn addition to evolving our brand architecture, we’re also actively experimenting with and expanding modes of engagement beyond Q&A for our public platform to reflect our new mission: to support ALL the builders of the future in an AI world—with clarity, speed, and humanity. It’s about showing up in a way that reflects who we are today, and where we’re headed tomorrow.\n\nOne of the ways we’re activating on the Cultivate community part of our mission is to introduce features such as Community Activity and resurfacing and refreshing older and less used features such as Chat. Community Activity is a new feature we’re experimenting with that displays active users online and the number of users who have asked questions in the last 24 hours. You can think of it as the heartbeat of the community, providing a real-time view into just how active and engaged the community is. As we continue to experiment, you’ll see Community Activity expand to more areas of the site and feature additional ways to engage in the community.\n\nChat is a real-time conversational space for developers to solve and socialize in a more casual way than our traditional Q&A format. Chat has been on our site for ages, but we’ve made it more accessible to more people and brought it front and center.\n\nAs we expand the site to support the career growth and continuous education of technologists worldwide, we want to make it easy to navigate to wherever you need to go and Power learning for those who visit our site. Many of us begin our search for answers with AI tools, but often once we get an answer, there’s a lack of certainty that those answers can be trusted or perhaps the answers you’re receiving are incomplete or lack the appropriate context. Stackoverflow.ai is a new way to support that discovery and learn along the way. This AI-powered search and discovery tool provides a familiar, natural language experience, but it’s enriched with clear connections to trusted and human-verified knowledge from Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange Network. You can ask questions, validate AI answers and dive deep into technical topics through relevant content, or choose a convenient path to connect with the community - all with step-by-step guidance.\n\nWe’ve also recently introduced Coding Challenges to our site! These new challenges represent a new, fun way for developers to level up by tackling captivating puzzles and earning recognition for your skills and creativity. It’s a rewarding way to practice and expand your knowledge with the Stack Overflow community in a space that celebrates diverse and unique approaches.\n\nAs AI becomes more pervasive, the efficacy of AI systems will increasingly depend on access to verifiable and accurate knowledge. That will extend to job opportunities too as people look for guidance on exciting career prospects, and this is why we aim to Unlock growth for those who come to Stack Overflow or use our products.\n\nThis is where Stack Internal (currently Stack Overflow for Teams), the private Stack Overflow for enterprises, comes into the picture. Today, we introduced three new capabilities for Stack Internal that make it the essential knowledge intelligence layer for AI tools and solutions within organizations.\n\nThe first is Knowledge Ingestion. Currently in pilot with several of our large enterprise partners, Knowledge Ingestion converts high-value content from tools like SharePoint, Confluence, Google Drive, and others into structured, trusted knowledge inside a Stack Internal instance. It’s designed to eliminate silos, accelerate onboarding, and scale institutional wisdom.\n\nWith developers exchanging valuable information across the enterprise in a variety of tools, we want to make human-validated and trusted knowledge from Stack Internal available wherever they’re working. We’ve recently launched a number of new Connectors that can support this including the Stack Overflow Connector for Microsoft Graph, which indexes and surfaces trusted Stack Internal content into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Additionally, our brand new integration with Backstage.io allows users to ask a question directly in their portal, access a dedicated Stack Overflow page with searchable tags and users, and get search results consistent with the Stack Internal platform. Our integration with Moveworks brings an installable Stack Overflow agent to Moveworks’ AI Agent Marketplace that users can interact with their Stack Internal instance using natural language.\n\nFinally, we shared that a bi-directional MCP (model context protocol) server is on the horizon. MCP is a layer built on top of the Stack Internal APIs that enables LLMs and AI agents to connect with data sources and interact with customers’ Stack Internal data more efficiently. Stay tuned for more updates on this and Knowledge Ingestion!\n\nAs our products and platform have morphed over the years, our audiences have grown alongside them. However, this expansion has resulted in our brand becoming stretched and eroding its clear identity and consistency. Over the last several months, we’ve been hard at work internally exploring what a refreshed visual identity for us might look like. Today onstage we shared a preview of some of the directions we’ve been considering. Additionally, in the spirit of keeping community at our center, we also are asking you—our global community of users—to weigh in! Explore the options and vote now.\n\nAt Stack Overflow we believe we have a pioneering role to play in shifting the conversation around the importance of attribution to our larger knowledge communities and trusted sources of data to secure a future with sustainable technological progress. By bringing together quality data and human experience to create sustainable, vital communities, we can build a future of Stack Overflow and the internet together that drives innovation and growth for all.",

    "fullText": "Ingress-nginx is officially being retired upstream.\n\nAs one of the original ingress networking solutions for Kubernetes, it has a large user base that will be impacted by this change.\n\nThe project is planned to be archived in March 2026. Without intervention, come March 2026, when the project is archived, it will be unmaintained and slowly become unpatched and unsafe to run.\n\nAs this would heavily impact the community, including Chainguard users and customers, we have taken action to commit to continuous maintenance of ingress-nginx through our EmeritOSS program — the same way we did with Kaniko.\n\nOur fork is available today on GitHub.\n\nIngress was the original way to direct traffic to services running in Kubernetes. It requires the use of an Ingress Controller, and ingress-nginx was one of the earliest production-ready solutions.\n\nMaintenance and development of the ingress-nginx project has been difficult for some time, with a lack of maintainers placing an unfair burden on existing maintainers who were often working out-of-hours and unpaid on the project. With no new maintainers joining the project, this eventually led to the decision to wind it down.\n\nIngress-nginx is a critical component in clusters, enabling external traffic to be routed correctly into the cluster. As such, it is exposed to user input, and security is of heightened importance. It is critical that organizations do not allow unmaintained and degrading software to run in such a position.\n\nFor the most part, ingress has been superseded by the Gateway API. And for users still on ingress, there are multiple other solutions, including NGINX Ingress Controller. Our EmeritOSS program extends the working lives of core open source projects to support users who still rely on them while they consider their next steps.\n\nWe need to be clear that we are not continuing the development of ingress-nginx. We are maintaining a working version based on the latest release. This support is intended to help buy users time to move to a different solution. We’re giving users time to evaluate options and develop migration strategies without risking the security of their clusters.\n\nWe will keep the project moving forward and up to date with fresh versions of libraries. If CVEs are identified, we will address them on a best-efforts basis.\n\nWe also have commercial ingress-nginx container images for users who require low CVE images with SLAs or FIPS versions.\n\nEmeritOSS provides stability-focused maintenance for select unmaintained and archived open source projects so teams who depend on these projects can plan their next steps.\n\nWe successfully trialled this idea with the Kaniko project and are now extending the project with Kubeapps and ingress-nginx.\n\nIf your organization depends on an archived or unmaintained project, we invite you to submit it for consideration so we can help keep essential OSS running safely for as long as you need it.\n\nThe only rule: Don’t look at the code\n\nPatrick Smyth, Principal Developer Relations Engineer\n\nThe State of Trusted Open \n\nEd Sawma, VP of Product Marketing, and Sasha Itkis, Product Analyst\n\nIntroducing Chainguard EmeritOSS: Sustainable stewardship for mature open source\n\nErin Glass, Staff Product Manager, Dan Lorenc, CEO and Co-founder, and Kim Lewandowski, CSO and Co-founder\n\nFork Yeah: We’re Bringing Kaniko Back\n\nPriya Wadhwa, Senior Engineering Manager, Kim Lewandowski, Co-founder & CPO, and Dan Lorenc, Co-founder & CEO\n\nGuardcraft: A Minecraft Java Server with Zero CVEs\n\nErika Heidi, Staff Developer Experience Engineer\n\nWolfi: a new paradigm in Linux for containers\n\nErika Heidi, Developer Experience Engineer",

    "title": "Writing for Developers",
    "description": "We decided to publicly release the internal guidelines we use to write clearly and effectively for developers.",
    "fullText": "Developers have a high bar for content.\n\nToday, we're publicly releasing the internal guidelines we use to write for our audience of developers.\n\nAlways picture one specific person as your target reader.\n\nUnderstand the expertise level, pain points, and motivations of this reader.\n\nThis is important to ensure a high degree of relevance. One post can't serve everyone.\n\nAfter GPT, people (and least of all, developers) lack the patience to go through unnecessary text.\n\nAvoid long sentences (anything over 30 words). Attention spans are fragile.\n\nWrite like you speak, with simple words and clear, natural sentences.\n\nAvoid unnecessarily complex words like \"akin\" and \"delve\". The subject of your writing is complex enough. Don't make your reader spend their limited energy on figuring out the meaning of your words.\n\nWhat language would you use when speaking to a friend? Use those same words when writing.\n\n…but don't over-optimize. A touch of creative writing has its place, it can add rhythm and personality to your words.\n\nAvoid forcing short formal phrases that you'd typically use in emails and internal documents. (Honestly, don’t even use them there.)\n\nUphold grammar, maintain flow, complete your sentences.\n\nAgain, the rule of thumb is to write like you're speaking to your audience on stage.\n\nMany blogs use up 10-50% of the writing on setting up the introductory context. Skip all of that, get to the point. If you've identified your reader correctly, they will already have the context.\n\nFor example, if you're writing a guide on Docker deployment, skip sections like \"What is Docker?\" or \"Why use Docker?\". Open with 2–3 sentences (perhaps about why this guide was necessary), then dive straight into the steps.\n\nBe precise. Don't make vague statements.\n\nDon't spell out what the reader can infer or judge on their own.\n\nOnce you have a draft, review and trim anything that doesn't add value.\n\nAim to inspire creativity and curiosity. You don’t always need to spell everything out. Nudge your reader to think in interesting ways and explore things on their own.\n\nSoftware developers are already subject matter experts. Don’t over-explain things.\n\nFor hard and confusing topics, the best articles are simple, fun, and easy to read, without watering down the technical depth.\n\nWhenever possible, bring something fresh that other blogs miss.\n\nIf you don’t understand parts of your topic, that's not a bad thing, necessarily. Admit it.\n\nTake extra care to get terminology right. Mistakes will cost you credibility.\n\nTypos, mixing up casing e.g ”Git hub” or ”Javascript”, mixing up asynchronous and concurrent, or calling Rails or React a programming language are all red flags.\n\nWriting from personal experience is extremely valuable. Developers appreciate insights from those who have actually dealt with the topic.\n\nYou can talk about how you built, used, learned, or fixed something.\n\nIn these kind of posts, write about the messy process, successes and failures.\n\nAcknowledging weaknesses and blind spots will build trust. Ignoring or dismissing them will raise questions on your understanding or integrity.\n\nIf you don’t have personal experience, you can try to research and present some insights from others’ experiences.\n\nThere are varying views on the inclusion of humor and memes. We welcome programming humor, you don't need to play safe.\n\nAvoid edgy humor or commentary on completely unrelated topics. You don’t want to unnecessarily offend your audience. Or lose credibility trying to look funny.\n\nFor programming posts specifically, include working code. Link a GitHub repository. This makes your article more useful to the reader.\n\nFinally, remember that all of the above are guidelines. You should always keep them at the back of your mind, but don’t be afraid to break a rule when you feel strongly.\n\nIf everyone wrote the same way, it’d be boring. Your unique style will make your writing more valuable in the sea of SEO-optimized, generic content.\n\nUse paragraph spacing after every few sentences. This makes the blog easy to digest and retains the reader’s attention.\n\nAdd images, GIFs, or videos every 1–2 screen scrolls.\n\nVisuals should have intrinsic value, and not just serve as text breaks. Use them to add insight or commentary that deepens the conversation.\n\nMaintain a design style consistent with the rest of your website pages and graphics.\n\nUnnatural language can sometimes slip into writing, especially for non-native speakers.\n\nUse tools like Hemingway App and Grammarly to receive ideas to improve your drafts.\n\nYou can also use ChatGPT. Enter a prompt like the one below.\n\n“Rewrite these sentences to how a native English speaker would have written them. Don’t lose the main message or deviate too much from my writing. Just tweak the parts that don’t sound like a native English speaker speaking.”\n\nDevelopers won’t take you seriously if they sense your writing was produced by LLMs.\n\nAvoid GPT-generated content. In fact, we recommend that you proactively avoid writing styles that are now associated with AI:\n\nYou should only promote a product or service in your blog if and where it adds real value to the conversation and benefits readers.\n\nAvoid inducing any forced bias. Developers will detect it instantly and reject your blog.\n\nNo developer has ever said, “I’d love to read a list of 50 Python packages.”\n\nFocus on real problems developers face where they\n\nHere are few themes where content is always welcome. We have linked an example for each.\n\nWriting is hard. Your first drafts will need several revisions. Ideas will change as you write them down for the first time. That’s normal. Your writing skills will develop with practice.\n\nOver time, you’ll realize that good writing both comes from and sharpens your clarity of thought.\n\nIt also forces you to improve your understanding of the topic you’re writing about.\n\nFinally, if we’ve inspired you, send us your articles. We’d love to read your work and share it with our community of top developers.\n\nPaul Graham’s short musings on writing are full of insights:\n\nHacker News guidelines provide a general idea of what kinds of posts work well there. Additionally, this HN thread shares tips straight from the community.\n\nYou can also check out Phil Eaton’s list of great non-corporate tech blogs or this round-up of the best engineering blogs from dev teams.",

Jon Kyl of Arizona on Tuesday announced his withdrawal from public life following a dementia diagnosis.\n\nKyl, 83, represented Arizona in both chambers of Congress for nearly three decades. Most of those years were in the Senate including a term as minority whip.\n\n“My family and I now head down a path filled with moments of joy and increasing difficulties,\" Kyl said in a statement. \"I am grateful beyond expression for their love and support, in these coming days as in all the days of my life. Despite this diagnosis, I remain a very fortunate man.\"\n\nKyl left the Senate in 2013 and joined the lobbying firm Covington and Burling. In 2018 he was appointed by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a fellow Republican, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of former Sen. John McCain. Kyl served several months before rejoining the lobbying firm.\n\nKyl leveraged his expertise on water policy in Congress to gain approval of tribal water rights settlements, said Sarah Porter of Arizona State University. He was an “important participant” in negotiations that created the state's water rules, said Porter, director of the university's Kyl Center for Water Policy that is named after the former senator.\n\nAs a lobbyist, Kyl helped guide the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.",

    "title": "Exiting CEO left each employee at his family-owned company a $443,000 gift—but they have to stay 5 more years to get all of it",
    "description": "Some CEOs have been very generous when selling their companies, but there’s little to compare with what Fibrebond’s Graham Walker just did.",
    "fullText": "When Graham Walker agreed to sell Fibrebond Corp., the Louisiana manufacturing company his father founded, he made sure the deal would transform the lives of its 540 full-time employees as much as his own. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, the 46-year-old CEO carved out a roughly $240 million bonus pool from the $1.7 billion sale to power-management giant Eaton, an amount that works out to an average of $443,000 per worker.\n\nWalker insisted that 15% of the sale proceeds be reserved for employees, even though they owned no stock, making the condition nonnegotiable for any buyer. Eaton ultimately agreed, with a spokesperson later saying the purchase “honors their commitments to both their employees and the community.” The bonuses, which began rolling out in mid‑2025, don’t all vest at once, though.\n\nTo ensure employees collect every dollar, Walker structured the deal so they would have to stay on the job for five more years, turning the windfall into one of the largest—and stickiest—retention packages in recent memory. The Fibrebond surprise echoes a broader pattern of founders cutting employees into big exits, a trend that goes some way toward countering the increasingly extreme CEO pay gaps that persist in the 21st century.\n\nWithout the condition requiring staff to stay, Walker believed the factory would have emptied out immediately. “I don’t think we’d have many employees on day two,” Walker told the Journal. He wanted to ensure a smooth transition to Eaton, protecting the business that had been the economic engine of Minden, a small city of roughly 12,000 people.\n\nWhen envelopes detailing the surprise payouts landed, reactions on the factory floor ranged from disbelief to tears, with some workers initially assuming it was a prank or a camera trick. Longtime employee Lesia Key, who started at Fibrebond in 1995 at $5.35 an hour, told the Journal that she used her bonus to pay off her mortgage and open a clothing boutique after years of living paycheck to paycheck. Others cleared credit-card balances, paid college tuition, or boosted retirement savings, even as many were startled to see taxes claim close to a third of their checks and to realize that quitting early would mean walking away from hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nHowever, the five-year requirement did spark some friction. A few employees “grumbled” that the annual payout structure made it difficult to quit if they wished, and others were surprised by the heavy tax burden that claimed nearly a third of their checks. Walker carved out a crucial exception to the five-year rule: Employees over 65 were exempt.",

    "fullText": "A major Groq investor said data center development was \"speculative\" and would put \"stress on the system.\"\n\nAlex Davis, the CEO of Austin-based investment company Disruptive Tech, sounded an alarm about the US data center market in an end-of-year letter to investors on Monday.\n\nHe said he was concerned about landlords who were building data centers based on speculation about future demand.\n\n\"I am also deeply concerned about the 'speculative' data center market,\" Davis wrote in his letter. \"The 'build it and they will come' strategy is a trap. If you are a hyperscaler, you will own your own data centers.\"\n\nHe said he predicted a \"significant financing crisis in 2027-2028 for speculative landlords.\"\n\n\"We want to back the owner/users, not the speculative landlords, and we are quite concerned for their stress on the system,\" Davis added.\n\nIn a similar letter on LinkedIn, Davis also talked about data centers, and said AI has spurred \"too many business models with no realistic margin expansion.\"\n\n\"This will not end well,\" he added on LinkedIn.\n\nDisruptive Tech has backed Groq, an AI hardware startup. In a press release in September in which it announced a $750 million capital raise, Groq said Disruptive Tech had invested nearly $350 million in the company.\n\nThe release also said that Disruptive Tech had invested in Airbnb, Spotify, and Slack, as well as AI-forward companies like Shield AI, Palantir, and Databricks.\n\nThis funding round took place shortly before Groq signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Nvidia in November.\n\nDavis's comments about data centers come as tech companies are spending billions of dollars on their construction.\n\nA Business Insider investigation into the US's data centers in June showed that at the end of 2024, companies had filed permits for 1,240 existing or planned data centers. This was nearly four times the number of permits in 2010.\n\nThese centers, which store, process, and distribute large amounts of data, use massive amounts of land, water, and electricity. Cities give companies tax incentives to build data centers, spurring the rate of their construction.",

A Reddit thread made him feel that the effort was worth it.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal released Monday, Niccol talked about his \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, which involved getting the brand back on track after several quarters of poor sales.\n\nAs part of his plan, he has tried to make Starbucks cafés warm and inviting third places, and made several changes to that effect. He introduced more seating and dine-in areas, offered free coffee and tea refills, and made baristas handwrite friendly notes on coffee cups.\n\nNiccol told host Alan Murray, president of The WSJ Leadership Institute, that there was one moment when he felt that his plan was working.\n\nHe said that he was reading a Reddit thread about people going through the interview process for a role at Starbucks, who asked questions like, \"What's one of the questions I should be prepared for?\"\n\nNiccol saw that people had responded, \"You better be prepared to talk about how you like customer service.\"\n\n\"And so when I saw that in the Reddit thread, I was like, OK, we're making progress on what the standard of service is that we want,\" he said.\n\nWhile Business Insider cannot confirm which exact thread Niccol was referring to, it saw that similar conversations had taken place on the r/Starbucks subreddit.\n\nStarbucks had previously been criticized by employees and customers alike for feeling like a soulless conglomerate chain. Customers reported long wait times and subpar products, which were detracting from the brand's reputation.\n\nIt's now been more than a year into Niccol's tenure.

    "description": "Oil prices have been on a downtrend due to rising output from non-OPEC producers and slowing demand growth.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices are on track for their steepest annual drop since the Covid-era crash in 2020, battered by fears of a deepening supply glut — and compounding economic pressure on Russia as sanctions and discounts bite harder.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures are trading around $58 a barrel, down nearly 20% for the year. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures are around $61 a barrel.\n\nOil prices have been on a downtrend due to rising output from producers and slowing demand growth.\n\nThe supply-demand dynamic has weighed heavily on prices, dulling the impact of geopolitical tensions that might otherwise have lifted crude, including US strikes on Iran in June and the US's blockade of sanctioned oil tankers going to and from Venezuela.\n\n\"What's really stood out in oil markets this year is the lack of volatility, particularly given the myriad geopolitical events and supply risks,\" wrote Warren Patterson, the head of commodities strategy at ING, earlier this month.\n\nPatterson attributed that to fatigue over geopolitical developments and growing expectations of a supply surplus toward the latter part of the year.\n\nFor Russia, persistently low prices have magnified the impact of sweeping Western sanctions over its February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDiscounts on Russian oil sold at export terminals have climbed back toward historic highs, squeezing exporters' profits just as energy revenues become more critical for Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration.\n\nRussian crude sold at discounts of $20 to $30 a barrel below the Brent oil price in December, making its widest gap at ports since early 2022, according to data from Reuters.\n\nAn analysis from Goldman Sachs earlier this month showed Russia's oil export revenues, measured in rubles, have plunged 50% this year, tumbling from the equivalent of 7.6% of GDP to just 3.7%.\n\nThe pressure comes as Russia's economic momentum slows.\n\nRussia's GDP grew 0.6% in the third quarter from a year ago, slower than the growth rates of 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first quarter.\n\nEconomic growth is set to cool even more sharply. The central bank now sees economic expansion of just 0.5% to 1.5% in 2026 and cut its 2025 growth forecast to 0.5% to 1%, down from earlier expectations.\n\nThat follows economic growth of 4.3% in 2024, when defense spending, state subsidies, and higher energy revenues bolstered Russia's economy.",

    "fullText": "The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane is back on, more than a decade after it vanished.\n\nMalaysia's transport ministry said in a release on December 3 that it would resume the search for MH370 on December 30. This is nearly 12 years after the Boeing 777 aircraft, carrying 239 people from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, went missing on March 8, 2014.\n\nIt said Ocean Infinity, a US and UK-based marine robotics company that conducted the search in 2018, would take charge of this latest round of search efforts.\n\n\"Ocean Infinity has confirmed with the Government of Malaysia that it will recommence seabed search operations for a total of 55 days, to be conducted intermittently,\" the transport ministry release said.\n\nIt said that the search would be carried out in a \"targeted area assessed to have the highest probability of locating the aircraft.\"\n\nThe targeted area lies in the southern Indian Ocean, the release said.\n\n\"The latest development underscores the Government of Malaysia's commitment in providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,\" the release added.\n\nThis is not the first time the search has been restarted since the tragedy in March 2014. Following the plane's disappearance, search operations continued for over four years.\n\nOcean Infinity led the search in 2018, but discontinued it after being unable to locate the aircraft. Last December, the Malaysian government promised to pay the company $70 million if it found the plane.\n\nIn February, Malaysia's transport minister, Anthony Loke, told the press that the search would start again. However, he said in April that the search was suspended because of poor weather conditions and would only restart at the end of the year, per a report by Reuters.",

    "fullText": "It’s been just over two weeks since the bodies of beloved filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, photographer/producer Michele Singer Reiner, were discovered in their Brentwood mansion on December 14th. Yet the public still has more questions than answers as to the details of exactly what led to their shocking murders, and it appears it might remain that way—at least for a while.\n\nWhile fans of the This Is Spinal Tap filmmaker have been anxiously awaiting the medical examiner’s report on the brutal slayings, because their deaths are at the center of an ongoing investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department has announced that they have ordered a “security hold” be placed on any documents “until further notice.”\n\nOn Monday, the County of Los Angeles Medical Examiner released a statement that read, in part:\n\n“On December 24 at 10:30 a.m., the County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner (Department) received a court order, initiated by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), to place a security hold on Medical Examiner case numbers 2025-19480 and 2025-19481, Robert and Michele Reiner. While the cause and manner of death were previously released on these cases, due to the court order, the information is no longer available. No other case information or records, including the Medical Examiner report, can be released or posted on the website until further notice.”\n\nJust ahead of Christmas Day, the death certificates for Rob, 78, and his wife, 70, were released and indicated that the official cause of death was “multiple sharp force injuries” (or stab wounds) with the manner of death classified as homicide. It was noted that the Reiners died within minutes of the injuries.\n\nRob and Michele’s 32-year-old son, Nick Reiner, was arrested just hours after his parents were discovered in the family home by their youngest child, daughter Romy Reiner, 28.\n\nNick, who is being held without bail at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles, has yet to be arraigned due to ongoing issues regarding his competency to stand trial. He did made a brief court appearance on December 17, wearing shackles and a suicide prevention vest, but his arraignment is not officially scheduled until January 7.\n\nNick has retained high-powered defense attorney Alan Jackson, who has represented big-name clients like Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey and who, this summer, helped to secure an acquittal for Karen Read in the death of her boyfriend, Boston Police officer John O’Keefe.\n\nJackson has urged the public to not jump to conclusions about the case, saying: “We ask that, during this process, you allow the system to move forward in the way it was designed to move forward, not with a rush to judgement, not with jumping to conclusions, but with restraint and with dignity and with the respect that this system and this process deserves and this family deserves.”\n\nThe LAPD closed its statement by acknowledging that they understand “the public’s interest in these cases and remain committed to transparency when possible. Information will be made available once the court order is lifted.”",

    "description": "The president took to Truth Social hours after the Kennedy family announced their tragic loss to share posts from MAGA supporters mocking the political dynasty",
    "fullText": "In the hours following the death of Caroline Kennedy's daughter Tatiana Schlossberg, President Donald Trump took to social media to mock the famous political family\n\nOn Truth Social on the afternoon of Dec. 30, Trump shared screenshots of MAGA supporters insulting the Kennedys for their response to his recent decision to add his own name to the Kennedy Center\n\nMembers of the family have claimed that Trump is barred from renaming the center \"by federal law,\" however, work crews have already added his name above JFK's on the historic memorial site\n\nAs the Kennedys mourned the untimely death of Tatiana Schlossberg — the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and granddaughter of President John F. Kennedy — Donald Trump took to social media to share posts mocking the famous family.\n\nTatiana, the middle child of Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, died on Tuesday, Dec. 30, at age 35, just over a month after publicly sharing that she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nThe news was shared by the social media accounts for the JFK Library Foundation, on behalf of Tatiana's family, which included her husband, Dr. George Moran, and their young children, Edwin and Josephine.\n\n\"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts,\" read the post, which was signed by \"George, Edwin and Josephine Moran, Ed, Caroline, Jack, Rose and Rory.\"\n\nTrump did not directly mention Tatiana's death in his social media deluge following her death. Instead, he shared screenshots of MAGA supporters mocking the famous political family for their recent responses to his decision to add his name to the Kennedy Center, a historic performance venue in Washington, D.C., which was dedicated as a memorial to JFK following his assassination in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.\n\n\"The Kennedy Family have LONG neglected the Kennedy Center, btw,\" claimed one. \"They don’t raise money for it. They never show up. And the only Kennedy who has been there recently is a member of Trump’s cabinet.\"\n\n\"The Trumps have always been supporters of the arts. The Kennedys are supporters of the Kennedys,\" read another.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Thursday, Dec. 18, that the board of the historic venue had \"voted unanimously\" to rename the building to the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.\" The following day, work crews added \"The Donald Trump and\" above the previously-existing lettering, which read, \"The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nHowever, controversy quickly arose among members of the Kennedy Center board and the family itself. Tatiana's brother, Jack Schlossberg, wrote on X that \"microphones were muted\" during the conference call where the board voted, and the outcome was \"NOT unanimous.\"\n\nJack's claim aligned with comments made by Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, who serves as an ex-officio member of the Kennedy Center board. Following the vote, Beatty took to X with allegations that she and other opponents of the vote were muted on the call and were not allowed to vote their differing opinions.\n\n\"For the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move,\" Beatty, 75, wrote. \"Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship.\"\n\nIn her video message, she continued, \"Clearly the Congress has a say in this. This center, the Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"\n\nOther Kennedys have approached the matter from a legal standpoint. \"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,\" wrote Joe Kennedy III, the grandson of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe Kennedys have yet to respond to Trump's latest attacks. The only family members who have posted to social media in the hours following Tatiana's death have been those sharing loving tributes, like Caroline's cousin, Maria Shriver, who was directly mocked in some of Trump's screenshots.\n\n\"I return to this space today to pay tribute to my sweet, beloved Tatiana, who left this earth today,\" Shriver wrote on X. \"I return to this space to pay tribute and honor her loving and supportive family, who came together and did everything they possibly could do to help her. I return to this space heartbroken because Tatiana loved life. She loved her life, and she fought like hell to try to save it.\"\n\n\"I cannot make sense of this. I cannot make any sense of it at all. None. Zero,\" she continued. \"My heart has always been with my cousin Caroline ever since we were little kids. My entire being is with her now. What a rock she has been.\"\n\n\"Those of us left behind will make sure Eddie and Josie know what a beautiful, courageous spirit their mother was and will always be. She takes after her extraordinary mother, Caroline. May we all hold Tatiana’s family in our collective embrace not just today, but in the days ahead, and may each of you who read this know how lucky you are to be alive right now. Please pause and honor your life. It truly is such a gift.\"",

    "description": "China's massive unmanned aircraft carries a payload of other smaller drones and has just had its first successful flight. Here's what we know about it.",
    "fullText": "The world's first drone mothership, Jui Tian, took to the skies for its first-ever flight on December 11th, 2025, in the Pucheng region of Shaanxi province in China. The massive remotely piloted jet carries up to 100 drones, which it can launch while airborne to reach faraway targets. Able to take off with a payload over 13,200 pounds and with a wingspan of 82 feet, Chinese military aviation analyst Fu Qianshao noted that it can carry more weapons and equipment than modern fighter jets and bombers. It has designated hardpoints for guided missiles and bombs on top of the 100 drones.\n\nOriginally revealed at the Zhuhai Airshow in late 2024, the first flight over a year later carries a lot of possibilities for China's navy. With a focus on long-range ballistic missiles and a fighter fleet with the capabilities to operate deep in the ocean, China is looking for ways to improve the range of its aerial army. The incoming army of drones from multiple directions would prove difficult for the opposition to deal with. For now, however, the Jui Tian may take on a more supportive role within China, like transporting heavy cargo to remote locations and providing emergency support during natural disasters.\n\nChina has recently been expanding the use of unmanned aviation in various branches of the military. The Jui Tian is remotely piloted over a satellite data link, able to deliver drones or other payloads over short distances with a 12-hour endurance. However, China has a lot of long-range unmanned aircraft in testing stages that would further shake up aerial combat and defenses.\n\nConcepts of the GJ-11 Sharp Sword, an unmanned stealth bomber, have been seen since 2018. The goal is for the aircraft to be fully autonomous over time. China has also been testing the CH-7 unmanned high-altitude stealth reconnaissance aircraft for a 2030s arrival, with the goal of supporting operations for both the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy and the Air Force. Images were revealed earlier in the year of an unmanned range stealth aircraft that appears to be designed for penetration missions by expertly shattering radar signals. And it's not just the air — China recently revealed an unmanned underwater drone system meant to evade sonar detection.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "NVIDIA is showcasing robotics, simulation, gaming and more at CES 2026.",
    "fullText": "At CES 2025, NVIDIA spent the bulk of its presentation touting (what else) its leading position in the artificial intelligence arena. But it also spent time talking up new hardware, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). This year, the company's website says it's \"lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.\" To that end, NVIDIA is pulling out all the stops at its Vegas installation, promising hands-on demos in its booth at the Fontainebleau, replete with the \"latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.\"\n\nBut don't worry if you're not on the ground in Vegas. Here's how you can watch the livestream of the company's January 5 press conference, and what to expect from NVIDIA at CES this year.\n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA's website (and likely on YouTube as well). We'll embed the link here once it's available.\n\nNVIDIA's game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including \"cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.\" It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we're unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES.\n\nGiven NVIDIA's sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers – largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang's remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company's Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA's partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang's presentation.",

    "fullText": "Christmas and the NBA have been synonymous since the league’s inception. The very first Christmas Day game was played in 1947 at Madison Square Garden between the New York Knicks and Providence Steam Rollers. The Utah Jazz themselves have been a part of this great Christmas tradition, playing eight games on the beloved holiday.\n\nJazz fans have fond memories of the six wins and probably have forgotten the two losses they’ve sustained throughout, but which is the best Jazz Christmas game? To commemorate this holiday tradition, The Lead has done its research to rank these Jazz Christmas games from worst to best.\n\nDisclaimer: there are only a select few games that have footage to go with them. Each game was ranked by the story behind it, how the game played out, and what players made the biggest impact.\n\nWhen it came to the most lackluster of the games, the Jazz vs the Phoenix Suns was the worst.\n\nThe game was played on Dec. 25, 1982, and the Jazz found themselves struggling to defend throughout the game. At one point in the third quarter, they were down by at least 20. They did manage a small comeback, but it wasn’t enough with the score being 111-101, Suns.\n\nThe only bright spots in that game were the combined effort of Jeff Wilkins, Ben Poquette, and Danny Schayes, scoring 58 of the Jazz’s 101 points. Number seven is the Jazz vs the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe seventh-place game on this list was played on Dec 25, 1977, against the Spurs (one of the last years the Jazz were in New Orleans). This game was between two 70s basketball heavyweights, Pistol Pete Maravich and George Gervin.\n\nThough the Jazz were never really close to winning, they weren’t blown out, and it was a little closer in score. Maravich led the Jazz with 27 points, four steals, and four rebounds. Gervin led the Spurs with 31 points, two blocks, five assists, and one steal. The game also gets bonus points for being the last Christmas game for the Jazz before the move to Utah.\n\nPistol Pete Maravich scored 3,667 points in 83 games over 3 years at LSU.\n\nIf you took the nation's top 83 single-game scoring performances in the last 3 years(not including this season)you'd have a combined 3,465 total points pic.twitter.com/By7PJ7WoPh\n\n— BaseballHistoryNut (@nut_history) December 4, 2025\n\nFor it being the first Christmas Day game, one would think this game would be ranked higher. However, the games to come stand out \n\nThe Jazz had a record of 11-18, though it didn’t stop them from punching above their weight. What the game lacked in story points, it earned in style points – the game was a slugfest between the two teams.\n\nThe Jazz controlled the first half of the game, then the Rockets stormed back to take the lead in the third quarter. Magic happened in the fourth, and the Jazz squeaked by to secure the two-point win over the Rockets. Any game ending with a winning shot is worth watching. Sadly, there was no found footage of the game.\n\nThe leading scorer for the Jazz was Louie Nelson with 21 points, seven rebounds, and two assists. Maravich scored 19 points and added four assists to the cause.\n\nThe fifth pick barely passed the sixth pick by being the Jazz’s first Christmas win in the twenty-first century. The year 2018 marked a new beginning for the Jazz as Gordon Hayward left for Boston and Donovan Mitchell became Utah’s new star.\n\nOn Dec 25, 2018, the league decided to give this exciting young Jazz core a chance on Santa’s big day. They were paired with a Portland Trail Blazers team, looking to prove their dominance.\n\nStyle points for this game were quite low. The first half was quite close, with Damian Lillard putting the Blazers on his back. He ended up with a stat line of 20 points, four assists, and five rebounds.\n\nOnce the Jazz got control of the game in the second half, they didn’t look back. However, player contributions were quite huge.\n\nDefensive beast Rudy Gobert had 18 points, 14 rebounds, and seven blocks. He was aided by Mitchell’s 19 points, two assists, and two rebounds. Even NBA legend Joe Ingles contributed 15 points to the Jazz’s win. Any game with Ingles deserves to be higher on the list.\n\nThis next game had both Jazz and LA Lakers greats going toe-to-toe with each other. Even though it was a blowout victory, the Jazz beating the Lakers alone makes this game legendary.\n\nThe game was a precursor to an amazing Western Conference Semifinals series between the two bruisers that same year. Magic Johnson had a good game of 18 points, 10 assists, three steals, and five rebounds.\n\nKarl Malone showed the league he was Him with 31 points, two steals, and 12 rebounds. Current Jazz color analyst Thurl Bailey added 22 points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nNot only did fans see great individual performances, but they also got to see a shoving match between Malone and Johnson. This further added to this game’s repertoire.\n\nPlayed on Christmas Day 1979, the third spot is a story full of triumph and heartbreak.\n\nThe Jazz won pretty handily against their Rocky Mountain neighbors, the Denver Nuggets. How they did it was quite phenomenal. It was a tight game through the second and third quarters. With the game on the line, the Jazz had two heroes emerge to lead them to victory.\n\nThe first player was Jazz all-timer Adrian Dantley, who came in to score 27 points and four assists. The second player to make his impact was a little-known shooting guard named Terry Furlow, who ended up scoring 37 points, five assists, and two rebounds. It was the best game of Furlow’s career.\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the biggest impact he made on the league. In the waking hours of May 23, 1980, after partying, Furlow crashed into a utility pole, killing him on impact. Drugs were found in his system.\n\nLakers legend Johnson was a pallbearer at his funeral – a stark reminder of how fragile life is and how important the holidays are to see family members and friends.\n\nAt Terry Furlow’s funeral, stars like @MagicJohnson, Campy Russell, Greg Kelser, and George McGinnis were some of the pallbearers at New Jerusalem Church in Flint. See this vintage @flintjournal photo. He was truly one of the greats.\n\n— Eric Woodyard (@E_Woodyard) January 2, 2018\n\nThe second-best game was set at the height of the Jazz renaissance in the early 2020s.\n\nThe Jazz were set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Dec 25, 2021. Having their best record in years, the three-seeded Jazz were looking to show the league who they were. The Mavericks, on the other hand, were full of a young core trying to prove themselves.\n\nThe game was like two heavyweights dealing blows. The Mavericks would control the game, then the Jazz would make a run. Mitchell had a heyday even while being hampered by an injury, scoring 33 points, three assists, and three steals.\n\nKristaps Porzingis and Jalen Brunson feasted on smaller defenders, scoring a combined 54 points. It took a combined effort from Mitchell, the Flamethrower Jordan Clarkson, and the rest of the starting core to win in the fourth quarter.\n\nOut of all of the games, this was one of the most entertaining, with both teams having trouble keeping a lead. It also had great performances from individual players.\n\nIt was tough to decide between the number one and number two picks. Both were great games and featured great performances. However, number one was a better game with Jazz greats playing to their fullest. Much like pick two, the number one game was a back-and-forth conundrum.\n\nBoth the Jazz and Rockets were getting a piece of each other in the early half of the season. On Christmas Day, 1997, fans got to see a preview of an iconic playoff series. It wasn’t until the third quarter that the Jazz managed to keep a small lead.\n\nJohn Stockton robbed the world of a Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets NBA Finals.\n\nJordan, Pippen, Rodman vs. Olajuwon, Drexler, Barkley would’ve been must see TV and the Rockets owned the Bulls back then.\n\nRockets in 6 https://t.co/AEzZxM47rH pic.twitter.com/5ifMVJeO8I\n\n— V̷a̷t̷o̷r̷ (@VatorSports) May 28, 2023\n\nThe Rockets weren’t done and ended up coming back to tie the Jazz 101-101 in the fourth quarter. John Stockton took over and scored four major points to put the team ahead. Kevin Willis answered back with a tip-shot to put the Rockets within striking distance. Bryon Russell struggled off the bench but drew a foul to shoot two free throws to ice the game.\n\nStockton scored 24 points and tallied three assists, while Malone added 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. Jeff Hornacek made a huge contribution as well with 20 points and nine assists.\n\nNot only did Stockton, Malone, and Hornacek outduel the likes of Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and Willis, but it was a glimpse of a great Western Conference finals matchup, showing why this game is worthy of the number one pick.\n\nThe post What is the Best Christmas Day Game in Jazz History? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles are heading into the playoffs as they look to defend their Super Bowl title. However, the Eagles could add to their roster more ahead of the postseason.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys released former All-Pro cornerback Trevon Diggs on Tuesday. Diggs inked a five-year $97 million deal with the Cowboys in 2023, but they have cut ties after an underwhelming 2025 season.\n\nDiggs has a 158.3 passer rating when targeted, which is a perfect passer rating. That means teams are completing passes at a high rate when targeting Diggs.\n\nHowever, he has shown he can be one of the top cornerbacks in the league, leading the league in interceptions in 2021 with 11 and earning All-Pro honors.\n\nThe Eagles could use more depth in their secondary and have shown an interest in adding a talented cornerback coming off some struggles. At the trade deadline, Philadelphia acquired Jaire Alexander from the Baltimore Ravens, taking the chance on a former star cornerback.\n\nAlexander was never suited for the Eagles, as he decided to take time off from football, but that move shows that they could be aggressive in adding to the cornerback room.\n\nDiggs is a player who fits that mold and could potentially help Philadelphia's defense on their playoff run. Even if Diggs continues to struggle, they don't have to play him over their current cornerbacks, and it wouldn't be costly, as he comes on a cheap contract.\n\nIf the Eagles were able to turn around Diggs's career, it would hurt the rival Cowboys more, which is an added bonus.\n\nPhiladelphia is set to be the No.2 or No. 3 seed in the NFC depending on the results of the Week 18 games. They haven't been as consistent of a team as they were in 2024, but still have a talented roster that could get back to the Super Bowl.\n\nWhile Diggs may or may not get back to the level he was at in the 2021 season, he could be worth signing on a cheap contract to add depth to the cornerback room ahead of the Eagles' road to repeat as Super Bowl champions.",

You kind of know what you’re going to get. … But there’s mechanical inconsistencies that will not be fixed immediately.”\n\nIf Mendoza goes to the New York Giants, McElroy sees him picking up steam much quicker.\n\n“I like the upside of Dante Moore and Fernando Mendoza better,” McElroy said. “Because I feel like the long-term prospects of those guys being super elite in the NFL feels more likely than it does with Jaxson Dart.”\n\nBut, for now, Mendoza told reporters Tuesday how much he is excited to play a storied SEC program, particularly quarterback Ty Simpson.\n\n\"I’ve seen him or heard about him for a long time now. He was one of the top guys. ... Not only was he a great quarterback, he seemed like he was a great guy. And I think everyone he’s rubbed off on whether it was his podcast with ‘Bussin with the Boys,’ I’ve always seen his personality shine through, and I think that’s why he’s such a great leader of that team in which people see he’s authentic, he’s genuine and they want to go behind him. Also as a player, he’s one of the best quarterbacks in the nation, no doubt about it.”\n\nThe Rose Bowl is set for New Year's Day (4 p.m. ET, ESPN).",

    "fullText": "IROQUOIS, N.Y (WIVB) — Last winter, Iroquois’ Justus Kleitz scored 30 points in his first game back from a dislocated elbow. But here’s the catch, he wore on a brace on his left arm and he’s a lefty. So he dropped all those buckets using his right hand.\n\n“I missed the first one,” said Justus Kleitz. “I was like oh that’s going to suck. Then I hit the next one and hit the next one. I think hit like five in a row. Everyone was like, ‘that’s crazy. You just scored 30 with your right hand. I don’t think I can make a layup with my left hand.'”\n\nThe Iroquois senior is averaging over 40 points a game this season. But for how dominant he is on the hardwood, he may be even better on the football field.\n\n“He’s naturally better at football to be honest,” said Todd Kleitz, Justus’ father and basketball coach. “He doesn’t really put time into football. He’s just good. I think a lot of it comes from being on the basketball court. As a point guard on the basketball court, he sees the floor really well. I think some of that translates to the football field.”\n\nJustus is statistically the best quarterback to come through Western New York. He holds the all-time WNY record for passing yards and touchdowns. But he’s much more than a stud athlete. Kleitz received the Call to Courage award last year for his excellence in the classroom and in the community.\n\n“Getting an award from an old Bills coach and being around Dawson Knox and talking to Dawson,” said Justus. “I was just like, it’s crazy. I never talked to an NFL player before and I’m talking to him. It’s incredible.”\n\nTodd Kleitz said it’s the best award that Justus has ever received because it shows his character.\n\nThe Iroquois senior is undecided on college. He added that football comes more natural to him. But he wants to play basketball at the next level because that’s his passion.",

    "fullText": "MLB’s history of steroid use continues to provoke controversy as a discussion related to Hall of Fame candidacy. The juiciest debates of all concern all-time great talents who have been kept out of the Hall due to their evidence-based connection to steroids.\n\nFormer Boston Red Sox greats Manny Ramirez and Roger Clemens are two examples of such players who have been kept out of the HOF due to their link to performance-enhancing substances.\n\nMeanwhile, more nuanced discussions on the topic in recent years have pointed out that there are multiple guys already in the Hall who have been linked to steroids, if not officially condemned with evidence.\n\nESPN’s astute MLB analyst Paul Hembekides explained where his line is drawn (during a recent podcast), and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nFor Hembekides, if you were an MLB player caught using performance enhancement drugs after mandatory testing was implemented in 2004, you don’t deserve Hall of Fame entry. However, by that same token, Hembekides doesn’t believe that players like Clemens who used steroids during the height of usage (and prior to testing) should be banned from the Hall.\n\nMajor League Baseball was a testing-free league from 1986 until 2004.\n\nHolding Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens to the same standard as players in the testing era is intellectually dishonest. pic.twitter.com/XNrXMkBtpo\n\n— Paul Hembekides (Hembo) (@PaulHembo) December 29, 2025\n\n“These are complicated decisions that writers and that voters need to make, (and) I’ve kind of made my piece with the fact that if you’ve tested positive, or we have clear reason to believe that you did (use) steroids after the testing was in place, then you’re out for me,” Hembekides said.\n\n“So count me out on Manny (Ramirez) and count me out on A-Rod,” Hembekides continued. “But Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, best we can tell, started using steroids at the peak of the steroid era, and the biggest mistake that they made was being so much greater than their peers.”\n\nSteroids were first banned in MLB in 1991 when commissioner Fay Vincent issued a memo, but there was no testing established. In 2003, MLB and the players’ union agreed to anonymous testing to gauge the prevalence of steroid usage. When more than five percent of these tests came back positive, MLB made a move to implement mandatory testing (with penalties), which began in 2004. This is the line in the sand referred to by Hembekides.\n\nIn 2013, MLB started testing for human growth hormone using blood samples.\n\nRed Sox’s Marcelo Mayer Makes Notable Jersey Number Change",

    "description": "He can also break the Chicago Bears all time yards in a season with only 108 yards set by Erik Kramer",
    "fullText": "Caleb Williams walks into Halas Hall this week knowing every number on the board. On Sunday against the Detroit Lions, he will step onto the field needing 270 passing yards to become the first Chicago Bears quarterback ever to throw for 4,000 yards in a single season, and just 108 yards to break Erik Kramer’s long-standing franchise record for passing yards in a year. The Bears are heading to the playoffs, but this game gives their young quarterback a chance to rewrite the team’s record book in front of a home crowd that has waited decades for this kind of passing season.​\n\nAround Chicago, the conversation shifts from whether the Bears can win to what this game might mean for their history. This franchise is known for dominant defenses and powerful running games, not for eye-catching passing totals. Yet, Williams sits within one strong afternoon of crossing a threshold no Bears quarterback has ever reached. Erik Kramer’s record stands as a measuring stick for modern Bears passing. Williams now has the chance to clear it while also pushing into a new tier with 4,000 yards in the same season.​\n\nOn the practice field, teammates keep the mood loose. Receivers talk about which route might carry the record-breaking yards, picturing a deep post, a back shoulder throw on the sideline, or a catch and run that sends the stadium into a frenzy. Linemen focus on their assignments, knowing that every clean pocket buys Williams the time he needs to let routes develop and chase both the win and the milestones at once.\n\nThe coaches emphasize that the goal remains simple. Play winning football first, and let the records follow. When Williams jogs out of the tunnel on Sunday, the stakes will be clear without ever being spoken. With each completion, the gap to 4,000 yards and to Kramer’s record will shrink, and an entire fan base will track the totals as closely as the score. One game against the Lions now offers more than just a tune-up before the playoffs. It gives Caleb Williams the chance to step fully into Bears history, to become the quarterback who finally drags the franchise into the 4,000-yard era and sets a new single-season standard for everyone who comes after him.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Caleb Williams needs 270 yards to be the first Bear to reach 4k yards",

    "fullText": "Ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has suggested that either Gabriel Jesus or Kai Havertz should be Arsenal’s starting striker from now on, labelling both options “a better player” than Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nGyokeres joined the club for £55m in the summer in a signing that many felt could prove to be the final piece of the jigsaw for Arsenal, though the Sweden striker hasn’t quite managed to settle at the Emirates, scoring just five goals in 17 Premier League appearances so far.\n\nThe 27-year-old has become the focus of an Arsenal attack that hasn’t quite clicked in recent weeks, and he was once again fairly ineffective despite the Gunners’s dominant performance in the 4-1 rout of Aston Villa.\n\nTo make matters worse, Jesus came on as a substitute for Gyokeres and scored the goal of the game late on, stroking a brilliant effort into the far corner to make it 4-0.\n\nAnd speaking after the match, Sky Sports pundit Carragher said that he is “a huge fan of Jesus”, before adding that either the Brazilian or Havertz “should be starting” ahead of Gyokeres.\n\n“The one negative out of tonight for Arsenal, is that Gyokeres should not be starting, when they have players like this,” explained Carragher.\n\n“In a couple of games time, when Jesus is a bit more up to speed, he should be starting. He's a better player than Gyokeres - that's a fact.”\n\nJesus and Havertz have recently returned from long injury lay-offs, with the former netting his first goal in over a year against Villa after recently ending his recovery from ACL surgery.\n\nWhile Gyokeres was signed to spearhead the Arsenal attack after a promising spell at Sporting, the Sweden international has failed to hit the ground running in England, and Carragher claimed that Jesus and Havertz are both better options to lead the Arsenal line at present.\n\n“There's been questions in the past asking if [Jesus] is good enough for Arsenal to go and win the league,” added the former England international. “But right now he's better than the guy they brought in who they thought was going to win them the league.\n\n“Him or Havertz as the central striker is a better player than Gyokeres. He lacks finesse and quality when you think of what they've got on the bench. I think Arsenal need to improve on Gyokeres and they've got players that can in Jesus.”",

    "fullText": "The Indiana high school boys basketball upcoming 2025-26 season like others across the country, is in full swing as the winter sports seasons have commenced.\n\nContinuing to top Indiana high school boys basketball are the Fishers Tigers, which is off to a sizzling 8-0 start after going 30-1 last season. The Tigers are back with plenty of talent dotted along their roster, but who else should we watch for out of Indiana when it comes to the state’s top teams?\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory.\n\nHere’s a look at the top 25 high school boys basketball teams in the state of Indiana according to the Massey Ratings, which ranks teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule and margin of victory, as of Dec. 30.\n\nFishers Tigers last year were just a bucket away from repeating as IHSA Class 4A state champions, falling in a heartbreaking, 67-66 decision to Jeffersonville. The team returns plenty of talent from a year ago as they continue to hold the No. 1 spot in our second set of Indiana high school boys basketball rankings. The Tigers brings back a pair of junior guards in Jason Gardner Jr. and Cooper Zachary, whom combined for around 26 points per game a season ago. Coming off a 30-1 season, the Tigers remain the team to beat as they’re off to a strong start through eight games. Gardner Jr. leads the team currently in scoring at 21.3 points per contest.\n\nSpeaking of another Indiana high school boys basketball team that last year ended up falling to Jeffersonville along the way in the Class 4A state tournament was Lawrence North, as they fell to the eventual champions in a 56-49 decision. The Wildcats bring back one of the state’s top power forwards in senior Brennan Miller, who averaged 13.4 points and 8.6 rebounds last season. Also watch out for forwards Kai McGrew and Kenneth Lampley, respectively. Lawrence North has yet to drop a contest as of yet through six games.\n\nCarmel started off the season with a football-like score of a game against No. 12 Zionsville, winning 35-28 to tip things off. Since then, the Greyhounds have been off and running through the Indiana high school boys basketball season so far. The month of January is certainly going to test the mettle of Carmel as they have matchups slated against No. 4 Cathedral (Jan. 3), No. 5 Plainfield (Jan. 16) and No. 20 Westfield (Jan. 10), respectively.\n\nThe Cathedral Fighting Irish dropped down a spot in our first set of regular season rankings in Indiana as they started the preseason at No. 3. Detroit Mercy commitment Keaton Aldridge, who averaged 11.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists last season, is back in the lineup. Another key player that’s back for the Fighting Irish this season is guard Julien Smith, who was second on the team in scoring in 2024-25 at 13.5 points per game. Both players have come on strong this season for the Fighting Irish as Aldridge leads the team with 18.5 points, 9.5 rebounds a game and Smith is averaging 18.3, respectively.\n\nRounding out the Top 5 of the Indiana high school boys basketball rankings is the Plainfield Quakers, which went 16-8 in the 2024-25 season. The Quakers have a solid roster coming back that includes senior power forward Noah Smith, who is committed to DePaul. The three-star forward has provided the punch in the front court for Plainfield as Smith is averaging 20.6 points and 8.6 rebounds per contest this winter.\n\n6. Crown Point Bulldogs (6-0)\n7. Mt Vernon Marauders (10-2)\n8. Pike Red Devils (7-1)\n9. La Lumiere School Lakers (3-1)\n10. Ben Davis Giants (4-2)\n\n11. Noblesville Millers (5-4)\n12. Zionsville Eagles (5-4)\n13. Silver Creek Dragons (8-1)\n14. Crispus Attucks Tigers (5-2)\n15. Roncalli Royals (6-0)\n\n16. Riley Wildcats (5-0)\n17. Penn Kingsmen (5-2)\n18. Brownsburg Bulldogs (6-3)\n19. North Huskies (6-0)\n20. Westfield Shamrocks (3-3)\n\n21. Saint Joseph Huskies (7-3)\n22. North Central Panthers (4-3)\n23. Homestead Spartans (7-2)\n24. Northridge Raiders (7-1)\n25. Portage Indians (10-0)\n\nFor Indiana high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — It’s a tall task to showcase what makes the current Highmark Stadium special, but the tour guides who are trained to share this knowledge make it look easy.\n\n“It’s a very special and privileged experience to be able to give people the first opportunity to walk into this building, the first opportunity to walk out on that field. It’s very special,” said Kevin Loewke.\n\nDid you know Highmark is one of the most difficult stadiums to kick a field goal because of the jet stream? What about the fact that there’s a cemetery sitting just beyond Gate 7?\n\nLoewke and Ken Kern have been guiding groups through more than five decades of history since the tour guide program began less than 10 years ago.\n\n“Giving a tour, part of it is putting on a show. I think we both have the opportunity to give our fans when they come in for a tour a little bit of a show, and not only share our stories about the stadium, but — more importantly, particularly in the last couple of years — we want to hear the stories the fans want to share,” Kern said.\n\nThe two told WIVB News 4 that each individual guide has their own routine, building upon it over the years by learning from one another.\n\n“Over the many years we’ve done it, we’ve added to our stories, we’ve made our tours more interesting,” Loewke said.\n\nAt the start of the month, the guides receive a schedule outlining tour dates. On the day a group is set to come in, the guide arrives early to make sure all spots are open to see — including locker rooms, the broadcast booths and the field. Loewke and Kern said recently they’ve started comparing the current stadium with the new one across the street.\n\nAs the final season comes to an end, both Kern and Loewke say it’s bittersweet — but they’re looking ahead at what comes next when the team moves across the street.\n\n“I was here last week for a tour — I thought it was my last tour,” Kern said. “I got here a little early and I was taking pictures of everything because, when it’s all said and done, I might want to go back and put my own little photo album together of the tours we used to do when we were here. It’s definitely bittersweet. We’re going to miss this place a lot. But, you know what, that place across the street — we can’t wait to get in there. We just can’t wait — it’s going to be fabulous.”\n\nTune into the News 4 special “‘Where Else Would You Rather Be?’: The Final Season” at 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 31 on the CW23, at 5 p.m. on Jan. 1 on WIVB, at 7 p.m. on Jan. 1 on the CW23, or stream the special on WIVB+.\n\nMarlee Tuskes is an award-winning anchor and reporter who has been part of the News 4 team since 2019. See more of her work here and follow her on Twitter.",

    "fullText": "Cowboys listed as ideal landing spot for veteran running back in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter missing out on postseason play for a second consecutive season, the Dallas Cowboys will have some major questions to answer over the offseason, including what they plan to do at the running back position.\n\nThe Cowboys got some surprisingly productive play from Javonte Williams this season. The fifth-year back has started in all 16 games for Dallas on the current campaign and tallied 1,201 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. He also has 35 receptions for 137 yards and two more TDs.\n\nUnfortunately for Dallas, Williams is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and his productive play over the course of the campaign may have elevated him out of the Cowboys’ price range, which would leave them seeking a replacement.\n\nThat’s where veteran back J.K. Dobbins could come in. Like Williams, Dobbins is headed for unrestricted free agency over the offseason, and he could prove to be a realistic, affordable target for Dallas.\n\nFor those reasons, the Cowboys were recently listed as an ideal landing spot for Dobbins by Alex Kay of Bleacher Report.\n\n“With Dobbins missing multiple games in all six of his NFL seasons—including all of the 2021 campaign and almost all of 2023—it'll be tough for him to earn any sort of long-term deal from a club,” Kay wrote. “… Dobbins will be well worth rolling the dice on for a cash-strapped club like the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nMore Dallas Cowboys news: Dak Prescott explains why he wants to play in regular season finale for Cowboys\n\n\"The team could be priced out of retaining Javonte Williams and will want to make up that lost production by coming to terms on a cheap, incentive-laden deal with Dobbins.”\n\nWhen it comes to Dobbins, health has always been a consistent concern as he’s missed a chunk of time in each of the last four seasons. He started strong in Denver this season before eventually being placed on the IR with a foot injury. Prior to the injury though, Dobbins had a solid season for the Broncos, tallying 772 rushing yads and four touchdowns in 10 appearances.\n\nHe’s still just 27 years old, so he should still have plenty of gas left in the tank, as long as he can stay on the field. Given their other options, Dobbins could certainly be worth a flyer for the Cowboys, who could also look to add a running back in the upcoming 2026 NFL Draft.",

    "fullText": "PITTSBURGH, Pa. (BLACK AND GOLD NATION) – The last time T.J. Watt suited up in a game was on Dec. 7 against Baltimore. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin is ‘optimistic’ that his captain can play in round two against the Ravens.\n\n“I’m open to utilizing him in any way that’s appropriate relative to his availability,” Tomlin said. “But certainly I’m more optimistic this week than I have been in previous weeks.”\n\nJerome Bettis looks back on ‘storybook ending’ to career\n\nWatt has missed the past three games due to a partially collapsed lung, which was caused by a dry needling treatment session at the team’s facility.\n\nLast week, he participated in practice for the first time since having lung surgery. Tomlin told Black and Gold Nation that Watt looked ‘great’ in practice despite the long layoff.\n\n“I doubt that T.J. is ever out of football shape or conditioning over the course of a 12-month calendar,” Tomlin said. “I just know how he lived his life and how he prepares, and how thoughtful he is in terms of what he puts in his body and how he trains.”\n\nWhile he’s still in ‘football shape,’ Watt was just a limited participant during practices last week. Per Tomlin, the decision on playing the former first-round pick could come down to the quality and the number of practices he has this week.\n\nThat leads to the question posed by ESPN’s Brooke Pryor. Would he have to be a full participant during multiple practices this week to play on Sunday?\n\n“Practice participation certainly would be more comforting in terms of making a decision, given he’s coming back from a medical circumstance,” Tomlin responded.\n\nSince it is a more unique circumstance, Tomlin does have to err on the side of caution when it comes to giving Watt the green light to play.\n\n“We want to be cautious about how we work him back into the fold,” Tomlin added.\n\nThree Steelers selected to Pro Bowl Games\n\nIt would be big for Pittsburgh to have Watt back in the fold. All-time, the Steelers have a 3-11 record in the regular season without the former Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nOne of the biggest games of his career could come on Sunday with an AFC North title on the line.",

    "fullText": "The No. 4 UConn men’s basketball team returns to action after a 10-day layoff following its 72-54 win over DePaul on Dec. 21. The Huskies are back on the road yet again as they travel to Cincinnati to face Xavier (9-4, 1-1) on Wednesday afternoon at the Cintas Center.\n\nThe Musketeers rank No. 100 in KenPom, with the No. 119 offense in the country, and 116th in the NET. These numbers aren’t great for a program that made two of the last three NCAA Tournaments, including just last season, but new head coach Richard Pitino has done a solid job building a team essentially from scratch that was competitive in non-conference play, perhaps more than a lot of people expected. The Musketeers beat both West Virginia and Cincinnati and lost by just one to Georgia.\n\nAs for UConn, the Huskies sit at No. 7 in KenPom and No. 8 in the NET. They have the fourth-rated defense in the country per KenPom, a continued step in the right direction from last season. The 12-1 Huskies’ only loss was to now- No.1 Arizona by four points in a game where Tarris Reed Jr. and Braylon Mullins were both out with injuries. In their last game, Alex Karaban led the charge with 21 points and three triples against the Blue Demons.\n\nThe Huskies look to start 3-0 in Big East play for the third time in their six seasons since rejoining the Big East, as the team did so in 2022-23 (3-0) and last season (4-0).\n\nDate/Time: Wednesday, Dec. 31, 5:00 p.m. EST\n\nTV/Stream: Peacock, NBC Sports Network (for YouTubeTV subscribers)\n\nRadio: UConn Sports Network, Sirius XM 85, Sirius/XM online streaming\n\nLocation: Cintas Center, Cincinnati OH\n\nKenPom Predicted Score: UConn 79-67\n\nThe Huskies and Musketeers have played 12 times, with the past 10 coming in Big East play. UConn has a narrow 7-5 advantage over Xavier with a 6-4 split in conference action. They last faced off on January 25, 2025, when Xavier beat UConn, 76-72 at the Cintas Center. Solo Ball led four Huskies in double figures with 20 points.\n\nAs of this writing, all players are expected to be available for Wednesday’s game. This includes Solo Ball, who sat out the Huskies’ previous game on 12/21 with a wrist injury. Dan Hurley said he’s been able to practice and will be good to go.\n\nRemember the last time a Top 5 UConn squad traveled on the road on New Year’s Eve to Xavier? It ended in a Musketeer win. The 14-0 Huskies led by Adama Sanogo and Co. suffered their first loss of the year in a game where the Musketeers used a big second half to pull away and hand the Huskies their first loss, more or less starting that infamous January of 2023 where the eventual national champs really struggled.\n\nThat’s not a one-off either. In fact, UConn has lost 3 of 5 games on the road at Xavier since joining the Big East. In addition to that game in 2022 and last year’s matchup while Liam McNeeley was out, the Huskies lost during the 2021-22 season by six points despite a combined 40 points from RJ Cole and Tyrese Martin.\n\nThat Xavier team in 2022 had names like Colby Jones, Jack Nunge, Zach Freemantle, and Souley Boum. The 2025 Musketeers don’t have that, not even particularly close, but somewhere deep in the mind of Dan Hurley, he’s having flashbacks from the past.\n\nWith the new head coach in Pitino, no scholarship players from last year’s Xavier team who played a single minute are back with the program. The lone returner is Roddie Anderson III, but he sat all of last season in a redshirt year. Pitino brought in players from all different levels of college basketball to construct the roster.\n\nLeading scorer Tre Carroll comes over from Florida Atlantic, where he was a key component to that Owls team that made the Final Four in 2022-23. Jovan Milicevic and Filip Borovicanin were both rotational frontcourt pieces for Pitino at New Mexico last year. Anthony Robinson and Pape N’Diaye were both reserve bigs for Virginia and UNLV, respectively, a year ago and retain that role for the Musketeers.\n\nIn the backcourt, All Wright (one of the best names in the sport) comes over from Valparaiso fresh off a great freshman year. Malik Messina-Moore and Isaiah Walker are both seniors from the mid-major level that have a lot of experience and games under their belts. Overall, this group has a good mix of veteran leadership and promising young talent.\n\nXavier has played two completely different games to kick off Big East play this season. In their opener, they hosted a struggling Creighton team that was searching for a big win. The result? A 41 point Bluejay win that saw them knock down 16 threes and shoot 60% from the field. Carroll only scored 7 points, by far his season low. The Musketeers looked lost on both ends of the floor and were down 27 by halftime. It was looking like that eighth place pick in the preseason poll may have ended up being too high.\n\nThen just a few days later the Musketeers traveled to Washington D.C. to take on Georgetown. After losing by over 40 points at home, it only made sense that they picked up a gritty road win on the road later on in the week. Carroll scored 22 points and Borovicanin had a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds in the 80-77 victory over the Hoyas.\n\nWith how well the Huskies have been playing early on in conference play with a pair of 18+ point victories, it’s easy to overlook some players who may be struggling or not playing up to their full potential that they’ve shown in non-con play.\n\nMalachi Smith is averaging 1 PPG and 1 APG through the first two Big East games after closing non-con with back-to-back 9-assist efforts vs. Florida and Texas. The Dayton transfer hasn’t been able to get a good rhythm going yet in league play, but he is averaging fewer minutes (15.5 in BE play, 19.8 in non-con).\n\nEric Reibe was everything UConn could have asked for and \n\nBoth UConn and Xavier do a good job of getting everybody involved in the offense, and it shows. The Musketeers are first in the league in assists per game at 18.6, but the Huskies aren’t far behind at 18.2. Those are on 27.1 and 29.2 made field goals per game, respectively, too, so both sides rack up assists at a rate north of 60%. Borovician and Messina-Moore combine for 8 APG, and Carroll and Anderson each average 2.8. For the Huskies, Silas Demary Jr.’s 5.8 and Smith’s 4.0 carry the load, but Karaban and Reed Jr. each average at least 2 as well.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea and Bournemouth served up a breathless 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge, a match shaped by ambition, uncertainty and one player who refused to shrink from the moment. Antoine Semenyo, amid strong expectation of a £65m move to Manchester City, played a decisive role for Bournemouth, creating two goals and conceding a penalty in a game that never settled.\n\nBournemouth struck first in the sixth minute when Semenyo’s long throw caused havoc and David Brooks finished from close range. Chelsea responded swiftly. Semenyo brought down Estevao Willian in the box and, after a VAR review, referee Sam Barrott pointed to the spot. Cole Palmer converted confidently before Enzo Fernandez curled a superb finish into the top corner to make it 2-1 inside 23 minutes.\n\nThe lead lasted barely four minutes. Once again Semenyo’s long throw proved decisive, Justin Kluivert reacting quickest to tap home. Bournemouth carried real threat thereafter and enjoyed the better of the first half, registering 14 attempts and testing Robert Sanchez repeatedly. For all Chelsea’s possession, Bournemouth’s directness unsettled them.\n\nAt the break, Enzo Maresca introduced Reece James and Pedro Neto, seeking control and urgency. Chelsea pushed higher, yet Bournemouth remained dangerous on the break. VAR dismissed appeals for handball against Malo Gusto, while Djordje Petrovic denied Estevao with a fine save from distance.\n\nChelsea had chances to win it. Fernandez blazed over from inside the box late on, the clearest opening of the second half. Joao Pedro replaced Palmer to audible frustration from the stands, reflecting a growing unease around Stamford Bridge. In stoppage time, Bournemouth nearly stole it when Enes Unal volleyed over from 12 yards after Amine Adli’s cross.\n\nThe draw leaves Chelsea with just one win in seven league matches and a worrying habit of surrendering leads, having now dropped 15 points from winning positions. December has been bruising, and confidence feels fragile ahead of a demanding trip to Manchester City without the suspended Moises Caicedo.\n\nFor Bournemouth, the performance carried encouragement despite extending their winless run to 10. Semenyo embodied their spirit, combining physicality, creativity and defensive discipline. Asked if this was his final appearance, Andoni Iraola said: “It is not his last game. I can’t say 100 percent but I think he will play, yes.\n\n“He needs to recover because we play Arsenal at home in another three days, against top of the league, he will be an important player for us, yes.”\n\nChelsea and Bournemouth remain searching for momentum, but on this chaotic afternoon, it was Semenyo who left the strongest impression.",

    "description": "Could Clemson bring in a familiar face to step back into the offensive coordinator position?",
    "fullText": "Clemson’s search for its next offensive coordinator is already drifting toward familiar territory.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, head coach Dabo Swinney parted ways with Garrett Riley on Monday, a move that immediately put the spotlight on how Clemson plans to reset an offense that struggled to find consistency throughout the 2025 season. Rather than casting a wide, public net, the early chatter has centered on comfort, trust, and prior success.\n\nThat’s where Chad Morris enters the picture.\n\nMorris is well known in Clemson circles, not only for his previous stint running the Tigers’ offense but for the long-standing relationship he shares with Swinney. Their history dates back more than a decade, and that familiarity could matter as the Tigers approaches a pivotal stretch with the transfer portal opening Jan. 2. Whoever steps into the role will be expected to stabilize the roster quickly while helping reestablish an offensive identity that has gone missing.\n\nAlthough Morris hasn’t called plays on a full-time basis in recent seasons, he has remained close to the game. He spent 2024 coaching at Texas State, served in analytical roles earlier in the decade, and took the 2025 season away from coaching to watch his son lead Virginia to an ACC Championship Game appearance. Even during that time, Morris stayed connected, spending time around Clemson late in the season to assist with preparation.\n\nMorris’ original run with the Tigers remains one of the most productive offensive periods in program history. From 2011 through 2014, Clemson routinely ranked among the nation’s top scoring teams, set numerous school records, and established the foundation for its rise on the national stage.\n\nFormer Clemson wide receiver Troy Stellato back in the transfer portal https://t.co/yeBexsZ5v8 pic.twitter.com/Fkwy0xzJkI\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) December 30, 2025\n\nA return now would look very different than it did a decade ago. Morris has already experienced the head coaching path, and this opportunity would be about fit and familiarity rather than ambition. For a program searching for offensive stability, that distinction matters.\n\nContact us @Clemson_Wire on X (formerly known as Twitter), and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Clemson Tigers news and notes, plus opinions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Clemson Wire: Former Clemson coach is a top candidate for the vacant OC job",

    "title": "Rapid Reaction: Northwestern basketball outlasts Howard 80-60 in Nick Martinelli’s return",
    "description": "After a sluggish first half, the Wildcats flipped a switch for a decisive victory to end non-conference play.",
    "fullText": "A surprisingly close first half was in tow, but Northwestern (8-5, 0-2 B1G) was able to pull away for a gritty 80-60 win over Howard (9-6, 0-0 MEAC) in front of a packed house at Welsh-Ryan Arena in Evanston.\n\nMuch like the return of Grace Sullivan for women’s basketball against Washington, top scorer Nick Martinelli was back in the starting lineup after missing NU’s loss to Butler with a concussion. However, Arrinten Page was dropped from the starting lineup, sitting on the bench the entire game for “violating team standards,” according to the Big Ten Network broadcast.\n\nDespite entering this game with the most efficient offense (49.1% FG) of the Chris Collins era through a season’s first 12 games, Northwestern has consistently been undermined by its defense. Teams under Collins have historically been defined by strong defensive identities, but that has not been the case this season.\n\nWith defensive ratings of 103.2 (KenPom) and 102.0 (Sports Reference), the Wildcats were posting their worst numbers since the 2014-15 season, where they posted defensive ratings of 103.2 (KenPom) and 104.7 (Sports Reference). The question then was whether that trend would continue.\n\nNorthwestern clung to a narrow lead for much of the game, and it felt like the ’Cats were never going to fully shake a persistent Howard squad, seeing their advantage cut to just two points early in the second half. Though Howard battled throughout, the Wildcats used a decisive late run to finally pull away, holding the Bison to just 32 second-half points.\n\nMartinelli led the ‘Cats offensively with a dominant 32 points and six rebounds, shooting 10-of-20 from the field. Tre Singleton provided a crucial all-around performance with 17 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two blocks, two steals and zero turnovers, playing with poise beyond his years.\n\nFor the Bison, it was Ose Okojie who kept Howard within striking distance for much of the contest. Okojie finished with a team-high 13 points, while Cam Gillus facilitated the offense with seven assists.\n\nThe difference in the game came from ball security and defensive pressure. Northwestern committed a mere five turnovers while forcing 14 from Howard, converting those into a decisive 21-6 advantage in points off turnovers. Though three-point shooting was nearly even, the Wildcats’ aggressive drive-and-kick game earned them 34 free throw attempts to Howard’s 13, providing the necessary margin to secure the win.\n\nBoth offenses sputtered from the opening tip. The Wildcats missed their first four field goal attempts before Martinelli drew a foul and sank two free throws for the game’s first points. Howard responded with a back-cut layup, and the tone was set for a half defined by defense and missed shots.\n\nThe Wildcats’ defense was active early, forcing eight turnovers and converting them into 13 points. A steal led to a transition foul on Angelo Ciaravino, who split a pair of free throws, and Singleton followed with a strong post move to put the Wildcats up 6-2.\n\nHoward briefly found its range, as Alex Cotton and Cedric Taylor III hit three-pointers to take an 8-7 lead. But the Wildcats responded with their own perimeter spark from an unexpected \n\nThe game remained tight until Mullins took over. Following a Howard turnover, he drained his third three-pointer in transition, forcing a Bison timeout with Northwestern leading 24-15 and 7:35 remaining.\n\nThird trey for @jmsaucing, 15-2 run for the 'Cats 😼\n\n📺 @BigTenNetwork pic.twitter.com/7JtSTsx9Ym\n\n— Northwestern Basketball (@NUMensBball) December 30, 2025\n\nHoward clawed back with a 5-0 run, capped by a Travelle Bryson dunk that prompted a timeout from Wildcats coach Chris Collins. Northwestern’s offense added seven more points before halftime, with a Jake West layup and a pair of Martinelli free throws coming off more Howard turnovers.\n\nMullins also rifled in his fourth three-pointer of the half to stay scorching hot and keep the ‘Cats in front. A Bryson three and a tip-in second-chance lay trimmed the Wildcats’ lead to 31-28 at the break.\n\nMullins was perfect in the half, scoring 12 points on 4-for-4 shooting from beyond the arc. Martinelli added 11 points for Northwestern, which shot 47.6% from the field and 62.5% from three-point range but attempted just 21 total shots.\n\nHoward stayed close by dominating the glass, outrebounding the Wildcats 20-10 with seven offensive boards. Okojie led the Bison with seven points, while Bryson added nine off the bench. The Bison shot 39.3% from the field and 41.7% from deep.\n\nThe Wildcats needed a more assertive second half after letting Howard hang around, and they delivered. The energy shifted decisively in their favor, turning a nail-biter into a comfortable 80-60 victory.\n\nThe half began with the ‘Cats sharpening their attack against Howard’s zone. Martinelli found space for a push jumper, and a strong defensive stand forced an early Bison timeout. The tone was set, though the Bison kept it close early, answering every Wildcat push.\n\nThe inflection point arrived midway through the half, and with the score tight, the Wildcats’ depth and hustle began to overwhelm Howard. Singleton was the Mullins of the second half, as his relentless effort on the glass and efficient offense sparked the key run. A sequence featuring a Max Green steal, a Tyler Kropp finish and Singleton’s own three-point play stretched the lead to 50-42.\n\nDefense ➡️ Offense\n\n📺 @BigTenNetwork pic.twitter.com/OC4etPNPwN\n\n— Northwestern Basketball (@NUMensBball) December 30, 2025\n\nFrom there, Northwestern methodically pulled away. It continued to dissect the Howard zone, with Martinelli, Singleton and Jordan Clayton finding easy buckets.\n\nDefensively, the Wildcats tightened the screws, generating turnovers and converting them into points. Jake West provided a steady hand, and even with Page sitting the entire game, the rotation had more than enough.\n\nThe final minutes were a formality. The ‘Cats attacked the press with ease, Martinelli pirouetted for a layup and the lead ballooned to 20. The Bison’s spirit was broken, and Northwestern closed out a dominant 49-32 second half to secure the win, proving it can flip the switch when needed.\n\nWith non-conference play closed out on a high note, Northwestern will look to earn its first conference win and start 2026 right in a Saturday clash versus Minnesota at Welsh-Ryan Arena on Jan. 3 at 4 p.m. CST.",

    "description": "Women's IC Champion Maxxine Dupri recently reflected on having a difficult time with hate she received online earlier in her career and how far she's progress.",
    "fullText": "WWE Women's Intercontinental Champion Maxxine Dupri shocked the WWE Universe when she defeated Becky Lynch on the November 17 edition of \"WWE Raw\" to take the gold from \"The Man,\" thanks to a little help from AJ Lee. Even before the victory, Dupri had already come a long way in WWE, from the manager of the Maxximum Male Models, to an actual in-ring competitor who is working hard to hone her craft. Dupri recently sat down with \"The Wrestling Classic\" and spoke about her evolution from fans booing her work during a live event to the point the locker room had to rally around her, to becoming champion.\n\n\"Thank you to my haters,\" she said. \"Truthfully, that live event, specifically, that didn't affect me personally. In the moment... When you're new to this and you're wrestling, I can't hear anything. I'm trying to make sure that I just survive this match and do the best I can do.\"\n\nDupri explained she did, however, have a hard time with hate she was getting on social media. She described it as a lesson she needed to learn and said people are entitled to their opinions, and she's entitled to protecting her peace.\n\n\"I have my people that give me my criticism and I know the things that I truly do need to work on that I'm falling short in, and I will always hold myself accountable for that and put my nose down and keep grinding,\" Dupri said. \"It was very challenging for a period of time, but there's pros and cons to everything and that's just part of this job.\"\n\nFans have been witness to a variety of video vignettes on \"Raw\" following her Women's Intercontinental Championship victory, showing Dupri working out in the Dudgeon alongside Natalya's \"Low Key Legend\" character, Nattie. Dupri said that Natalya, and her husband, former WWE star-turned-producer TJ Wilson, have single handedly changed the direction of her career thanks to their training.\n\n\"I think so much of this last year and everyone saying, 'Oh, Maxxine's improved a lot and we're seeing this new side.' It's truly what we do in the Dudgeon,\" she explained. \"Nattie says [it's] finding my 'FU.' It's the way that they push me to my limits in there... Pressure makes diamonds. They have to break you to make you and that is what happens in the Dudgeon.\"\n\nDupri said that the things she's learning in the Dudgeon are applicable to what she needs to be doing to remain on top of things in her matches to be able to stay on the offensive, as well as to reverse certain moves. She credited her training for her victory in her recent match against Ivy Nile. Dupri is set to square off with Lynch for the Women's IC title once again on the first \"Raw\" of 2026.\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit \"The Wrestling Classic\" and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

On behalf of the club, I would like to thank all members and fans for their support and loyalty,” Hainer told FCBayern.com. “Together, we can look back on an anniversary year with plenty of reasons to celebrate, which also gives us plenty of reasons to be optimistic: FC Bayern is in an excellent position, not least when you look at the league tables for our professional teams in both men’s and women’s football – and above all beyond that.\n\n“In sporting terms, we celebrated the ‘Bavarian treble’ with the men’s and women’s football championships and the basketball championship – something that has never happened before, and the women also won the double for the first time in their history. Financially, our CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen was able to post outstanding results at the Annual General Meeting, and in social matters, we once again implemented many projects in which we’re committed to helping people in need, promoting open-mindedness and diversity. In recent weeks in particular, we’ve been able to implement important decisions such as the extension of Vincent Kompany’s contract until 2029 and the acquisition of the Sportpark Unterhaching for the women’s team. We celebrated 125 years of FC Bayern and are in an excellent position to continue our success story.”\n\nA big part of how others view 2026 will be tied to the success of the men’s team, which is in great position at the moment. Will Hainer have the same type of outlook at this time next year?\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "fullText": "Despite missing many of their heavy hitters, Manchester United fans must have been confident of claiming all three points on Tuesday.\n\nAfter all, the Red Devils were playing at home against bottom-of-the-barrel Wolverhampton Wanderers, on the back of keeping a clean sheet against Newcastle last week.\n\nHowever, the home side had to be content with a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, in a game characterised by bizarre calls.\n\nRuben Amorim once again chose to tweak things at the back, while his substitution calls were all wrong as he once again adopted a safety-first approach instead of throwing the kitchen sink.\n\nAnd skipper on the night, Lisandro Martinez was far from pleased with this attitude. In his post-match interview with Sky Sports, the Argentine did not hold back.\n\nHe claimed that the 20-time English league champions should be defeating this type of opposition at the Theatre of Dreams, and the lack of risk was an affront to what the club stands for.\n\n“Really disappointed. We can’t come here at home and draw this game. We have to win when we play at home. The opponent has to suffer and we didn’t get the three points.\n\n“Very frustrating. The team gave everything. Just for a few moments, we conceded in the last moment of the first half, that can happen. We can deserve that, it’s our responsibility.\n\n“We played well with the ball in the first half but then we dropped too much, couldn’t press their centre backs. They were comfortable with the ball and they started moving round and creating spaces.\n\n“Wolves don’t deserve the place they are, it’s a strong team. We respect them. We have to take more risks.\n\n“The lads are very disappointed, we expect better. We have to take it and accept it and go for the next one.”\n\nNot utilising all five subs, while changing things at the back instead of being bold has become a hallmark under Amorim.\n\nA draw means the 20-time English league champions remain sixth in the table, squandering the opportunity to go fourth. Up next is a visit to Elland Road to play arch-rivals Leeds United.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

This year, John Wood, owner and head coach of Syndicate MMA in Las Vegas, was behind the greatness MMA Junkie's 2025 Fighter of the Year, Merab Dvalishvili, plus many other standout performances.\n\nWood, a veteran coach, helped turn Dvalishvili from a champion unlikely to make a title defense, at least according to the odds and general perception, to one of the most dominant champions in the history of the UFC bantamweight division.\n\nDvalishvili entered UFC 311 in January as an underdog against challenger Umar Nurmagomedov. Yet, against the odds, Dvalishvili outworked Nurmagomedov over the course of 25 minutes, announcing to the world that he was here to stay, and earning a Fight of the Night award in the process.\n\nThe work didn't stop there for Wood. Dvalishvili wanted nothing to do with the typical championship calendar in the UFC, which often involves two title defenses. Wood had to go back to the drawing board and prep for three more championship fights, as Dvalishvili went for MMA history – trying to become the first ever to defend a UFC title four times in a calendar year.\n\nWood got Dvalishvili ready for UFC 316 in June. He not only dominated Sean O'Malley in the rematch, but this time he finished him, becoming the first to submit \"Suga.\" It was a huge sign Dvalishvili had leveled up under Wood's wing. Dvalishvili would return four months later to face Cory Sandhagen at UFC 320 in October. Once again, he dominated, completely shutting down Sandhagen to tie the record for the most consecutive UFC bantamweight title defenses.\n\nFast-forward two months, and Wood was back again cornering a UFC championship fight – this time with Dvalishvili taking on former champion Petr Yan. Unfortunately for Dvalishvili and his camp, they fell short in their bid for history. Yan had the game plan to dethrone Dvalishvili. Yet, despite the defeat, Dvalishvili made a good account of himself, likely co-creating the best championship fight seen in the history of the UFC's bantamweight division.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect run for Dvalishvili in 2025, but it was a damn good one, and Wood was there every step of the way.\n\nWood also had his hand in many other big wins in 2025. He cornered Khalil Rountree's decision win over former champion Jamahal Hill at UFC Baku; Nazim Sadykhov's brutal KO wins over Ismael Bonfim and Nikolas Motta; Luana Santos' 2-0 run; and others.\n\nWood's fantastic work with \"The Machine\" along with other fighters is the reason why he's MMA Junkie's 2025 Coach of the Year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: John Wood names 2025 Coach of the Year",

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim says “there is no doubt in” his “mind” that Manchester United will finish the season well.\n\nThe United head coach was speaking at the post-match press conference following his side’s dismal 1-1 draw with Wolves at Old Trafford this evening.\n\nThe first question of the conference was whether Amorim feels the seven senior absences contributed to tonight’s poor result.\n\n“That is normal, but we didn’t use that excuse against Newcastle,” Amorim replied.\n\n“We are not going to use today. But of course, if you see the game, I understand why we play the way we play today, the lack of fluidity, lack of one against one. We knew that that would be a completely different game compared to Newcastle, because in Newcastle, we have more space to play. We didn’t have to work the play so much. And today, we have difficulties in that aspect and that is clear.”\n\nThe boss was then asked to explain why he had made a tactical tweak of reverting to three at the back, switching Patrick Dorgu back to the left.\n\n“No, we knew that they will play with five. They will use it the width. And today was just to do that and then sometimes building up with him open or close with Luke Shaw doing the opposite,” he explained. “So we try to arrange the right situations for the situation that we have in the moment.”\n\nThe next question came from the BBC’s Simon Stone.\n\n“Ruben, you’ve said a lot that you know that this team is not a finished article, but is this, tonight, an example that you need more creativity in your side? There was a lack of creativity, and it feels as though there’s some players within your squad who can’t give you what you need, and you need greater depth?”\n\n“No, I think we are in one situation that you have a lot of players out in the same time. Of course, when you play Casemiro and Ugarte in the middle, you know that is different. When you have Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount or Bruno, that is normal. We just need to recover our players, the players from Afcon to return, and then the fluidity is going to be different.”\n\n“But again, we won the last one and today we could win with the players that we have. We had lack of fluidity and then lack of quality and then lack of creation of chances. Then we suffered a goal with set pieces with the team, and we are tall in this moment. So these details are important to win these games in difficult moments.”\n\nThe next reporter asked Amorim if it was difficult to try to bring academy players in to the team in such difficult circumstances.\n\n“Yeah, it’s completely different,” he agreed. “You know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle. It’s completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid. You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects. I think that was what happened during the game.”\n\nThe follow-up question was about the level of risk Amorim took in substituting the goalscorer Joshua Zirkzee at half-time.\n\n“We need to do what the game was asking,” he explained. “We were struggling. They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and we managed to do with Jack, we balanced that. I think we recover the ball faster in the second half. In the first half, we struggled a little bit to recover the ball. I’m just looking not for their age and the experience. In this moment, I just look what I can do to win the game.”\n\nWas the Zirkzee substitution due to an injury or was it purely tactical? “No, it was just tactical,” Amorim replied.\n\n“The home form was encouraging at the start of the season, but that’s now one win in five at home, and most of the opponents have been from the lower end of the table. Is it an extra pressure being at home? Why do you think this is happening? It wasn’t just tonight, where it’s been a struggle.”\n\n“I don’t feel… I think against Everton, we clearly underperformed,” he said. “West Ham, we had some lack of creation, but we have our chances. Bournemouth, we had advantage three times. So it’s the details. It was not offensively, was not the creation of chances. We had the game. We had full control of the game. Today was completely different. Newcastle, we struggled, but we managed to win at home.”\n\n“I think this year, I don’t feel that. I feel the support of the fans when we are here. I feel that they want to play at home. I feel that we are dominant at home. We won one that they were a little bit more dominant, was the last one. Today, we had lack of quality, fluidity in the game today, and that was the reason of our game today.”\n\nSimon Peach asked “Andy’s touched on the other point, home results. You’re only two points off of a potential Champions League spot at the halfway point of the season. How do you look at things going into the new year and how confident are you?”\n\n“I’m really confident. We just need to recover all the players and I’m really confident,” the boss smiled.\n\n“I don’t know what is going to happen until the end of the season. Then we will make the resumé of the season. But I’m really confident when we recover all the players that we are going to be a strong team. There is no doubt in my mind.”\n\nFinally, asked whether anyone will be back for the next match against Leeds, he answered:\n\n“I don’t know. I have to check. I’m not going to risk anyone to lose them for one month or two months. We will try to arrange the solutions. Again, let’s see, and we will try to win the next one with no risks for the players.”\n\nFeatured image Alex Livesey via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "EMMITSBURG, Md. — I never actually thought that I would make the trip down to Mount St. Mary’s for a game. Over the last three four years that the Mount has been in the MAAC, as I’ve made my schedule, I don’t even write their home games down on the list of games to choose from. I’ll probably continue to do that. It took a pretty extravagant effort to go in the first place on Monday, but I’m extremely pleased that I did.\n\nWhile the rest of the schools in the conference are in urban or suburban settings, the Mount is plopped down a few miles from town on either side of Highway 15. There’s nothing around. On one side, the athletic complex. On the other side, all of the academic buildings. If you stand in just the right spot on the side of the athletic complex, you see the golden twinkle of the Statue of Blessed Mother, nestled amongst the hilly backdrop, rising high above the blue triangular facade of Knott Arena in the foreground. It’s a view unlike any other in the conference.\n\nThe arena itself transports you to a different era. Its unique architecture and wooden bleachers give it an energy that exudes historical importance, even though it’s merely a 38-year old building. Then you look up and see the massive new videoboard in one end zone, and the balcony-style hospitality seating in the other end zone.\n\nMount St. Mary’s athletic director Brad Davis has pushed renovations and changes to many parts of the building since he took over, but he also takes pride in the charm that it offers. He said that people tell him that Knott Arena is “the Hinkle of the MAAC.” I can’t say whether they’re right or not, but there’s an aura of mysticism that other venues in the conference just don’t have.\n\nI’ve made the trip. I successfully battled the cutting gusts attempting to sweep my Nissan Kicks off of its wheels to make it and watch a basketball game between the Mount and Iona. The Mountaineers grabbed a 66-59 victory – their first MAAC win of the year – riding two 10-point scoring runs in the second half. Here are three takeaways from each team\n\nAfter missing the first 10 games of the season, Wofford transfer Anthony Arrington made his Mount debut against Loyola on Dec. 13. He slid right into the guard rotation on the bench, having played 21 minutes per contest over the last four.\n\nIn the second half on Monday, Arrington scored seven points in a row for the Mount as part of the first of the two 10-0 scoring runs. He gave the Mount a 42-41 lead with a corner three, and the building erupted.\n\nHe also played a role in bottling up Iona star CJ Anthony. He supplements Xavier Lipscomb’s physicality with another strong body off the bench, part of why the Mount was able to play the game that it wanted to play for a full 40.\n\n“We were able to put guys on him that could match his physicality,” Donny Lind said. “We made it uncomfortable for him as much as we could. He’s a really good player, and I was pleased with the effort we had.”\n\nArrington hasn’t been efficient offensively so far, but that second half stretch shows that he can provide a lift when needed.\n\nLuke McEldon is 6-foot-10, 255 pounds but has skill beyond being a straight bruiser. That’s becoming a rare archetype in the MAAC and at the mid-major level, and he balled out on Monday with 18 points on 9-of-12 shooting from the field.\n\nThe Mount got him involved early and often. He got post-ups against Lamin Sabally – whom he has two inches and 40 pounds on. He got dropoffs from the guards for layups, and he played with comfort and energy throughout the night.\n\n“We usually try to get the ball inside as often as possible early in the game,” McEldon said. “And from there we can play on the outside.”\n\nBut on a night where the outside shots weren’t falling, it was McEldon and Justin Amadi pounding it down low all night. Even when McEldon picked up two fouls in the first half, Lind stuck with him for a few minutes, trusting him to not pick up a third while being the matchup problem that he is.\n\nIt’s going to be hard to top AK Kébé’s alley-oop dunk during the second 10-0 run when it comes to picking out the best slam of the year in the MAAC. Arlandus Keyes let go of the ball when Kebe was still a foot or two behind the 3-point line, but suddenly, Kebe appeared at the rim, sneaking past Alliou Fall to grab the ball where only he could get it and flush it home.\n\nThe Mount has scored six in a row and that was an ABSURD alley-oop from Arlandus Keyes to AK Kebe in transition. Kebe just glided through the air for that one and appeared at the rim for a monster slam.\n\nMonster crowd reaction. Timeout Iona. 52-46\n\n— Sam Federman (@Sam_Federman) December 30, 2025\n\nIt immediately forced an Iona timeout. The Knott Arena crowd was stunned. For a Mount St. Mary’s team that feeds off of energy and emotion – as we saw in the MAAC Tournament – it was a play that got the entire bench jumping.\n\n“It was insane, it better be on SportsCenter,” Arrington said.\n\n“We’re working with him and focusing on those things that he can do that nobody else can,” Lind said. “With his length and his athleticism, and the ability to get deflections, and the ability to make plays on defense that turn into offense, or a tip-in.”\n\nIt was just Kebe’s fifth game of the season, as he missed the first eight and the Loyola game, but the tantalizing moments are happening more often this year.\n\nIona leads the MAAC with 13 killshots (10-0 runs), and it even had one in the first half of this game. It nearly had another in the early part of the second half, scoring eight in a row to build a nine-point lead. However, the Gaels couldn’t stack possessions together in between runs once the threes stopped falling early on.\n\nThen, in the second half, the Mount put together two killshots. One to take a 42-41 lead, and then one to take a 58-46 lead, essentially salting the game away by holding the Gaels scoreless for more than four minutes.\n\nLike the Quinnipiac game, a physical MAAC opponent just wore them down in the second half. Dan Geriot looks at when the Gaels had a 41-32 lead as a missed opportunity.\n\n“It’s more like how do you keep hitting those singles, how do you keep pushing forward together?” Geriot said. “And a lot of the snowball that went the wrong way was based on our transition offense, and that’s something that we have seen a little bit before, so we need to understand that, feel that, see it on film and continue to converse with the guys about it.”\n\nCJ Anthony might be the single best story in the MAAC this season. I’ll tell you that story in a feature later this week. He took the league by storm in non-conference play but played his worst game of the season on Monday.\n\nHe’s essentially been able to control the game flow for Iona almost every night, and if he couldn’t, he’d hit a few big shots to make up for it. He didn’t have that against the Mount. He scored 10 points on 3-9 from the field, which isn’t a bad “worst game,” but it certainly felt as though he didn’t have the impact that he usually does.\n\nThe Mount put a few different bodies on him, threw pressure at him and mitigated his impact, but it’s all part of the process for Geriot.\n\n“I think it’s him learning it,” Geriot said. “I talk about it all the time, we gotta go through this. Dealing with ball pressure is good for him, I believe we failed correctly tonight. I don’t believe we were out of sorts – we were out of sorts with our passing, and that’s a big thing for us.”\n\nAs previously mentioned, McEldon had a great night for the Mount. Iona as a team is much better defending the perimeter than the paint, and the Mountaineers leveraged different ways to get in the paint and feed McEldon to exploit that.\n\nGeriot thinks the Gaels need to read the plays better when the ball gets in the paint.\n\n“We’re giving up too much at the rim by overhelping,” he said. “We got to continue to read our help, and that’s how we become an elite defensive team.”\n\nSiena’s staff definitely saw how the Mount created points at the basket, and would love to see Justice Shoats and Gavin Doty hit those dropoffs to Tassie Goodrick (should he play) and Antonio Chandler on Friday night.\n\nMarist’s three MAAC games this year have been 72, 75, and now 68 possessions. Of the 21 that it played last year, only four of them were 68 or more possessions. Asim Jones has scored in double figures in six of the last seven games for Quinnipiac, and the one time that he didn’t is QU’s only loss in that stretch. While Tarik Watson and Jason Schofield can rack up points when they get the ball in the post, I don’t always feel like the best use of Marist’s possessions is playing through the bigs.\n\nMerrimack was probably due for a better shooting night after going 26% and 27% against Princeton and Vermont, and Sacred Heart got caught in the crosshairs of that early. The Warriors started 5-0 last year, and are 3-0 to start this season despite five new starters. It was another 18 points and 7 assists for freshman point guard Kevair Kennedy, who is making a habit out of that at the moment. Sacred Heart is allowing opponents to shoot 61% inside the arc in MAAC play.\n\nDavis Bynum had a game-high 19. He had just 17 total points on the season after the Broncs lost to Quinnipiac on Dec. 7. He’s now set season highs in four successive games. Perhaps Rider playing through him and Shemani Fuller more will lead to more success. But Manhattan got big bench production from Anthony Isaac and Terrance Jones. The Jaspers are still a thin team, but have two punches off the bench this year instead of just one.\n\nZaakir Williamson had his first double-double in a Saint Peter’s uniform, but the Peacock guards crashing the glass (eight rebounds for Bland, seven for Eaton) might be the story of the game. Fairfield is a tremendous rebounding team, and Saint Peter’s got in there and beat them on the glass. We know that Braden Sparks, Brandon Benjamin and Declan Wucherpfennig can put numbers on the board, but the Stags need to find consistent offense beyond those three.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers halted a three-game losing streak with a win over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday and now look to make it two in a row when they host the Detroit Pistons on Tuesday, December 30.\n\nFather Time may be undefeated, but LeBron James is still keeping him at bay. As he celebrates his 41st birthday, my Pistons vs. Lakers predictions and NBA picks anticipate another strong showing from King James.\n\nPistons vs Lakers best bet: LeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists (-115)\n\nLeBron James has played 10 games on his birthday throughout his career, averaging 32.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 6.9 assists, going for at least 35 PRA in every game played on December 30.\n\nSince his streak of double-digit scoring games was snapped on December 4, James has averaged 25.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists across eight games. He’s reached 36 PRA in five of 14 games this season, including four of his last eight.\n\nWith Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, and Rui Hachimura sidelined for the Los Angeles Lakers, James will need to take on a larger role as a scorer, rebounder, and facilitator. Tonight’s tilt with the Detroit Pistons should feature plenty of points, which means additional opportunities for James to stuff the stat sheet.\n\nJames surely understands the gravity of this moment, as he’s playing in a record-setting 23rd season and taking the court, and I expect him to make a statement tonight on his 41st birthday, showing that age is just a number.\n\nThe Lakers are 19-11 to the Over, and the Pistons are 16-15-1 O/U.\n\nLos Angeles has hit the Over in 11 of 13 home games, good for the highest percentage in the Association. The Lakers have gone Over in four of five as the home underdog. Detroit has hit the Over in two of its last three outings, including high-scoring matchups against the Utah Jazz and Sacramento Kings.\n\nThe Pistons should be motivated to snap a two-game skid when they visit Crypto.com Arena tonight.\n\nDetroit most recently fell to the Los Angeles Clippers thanks to a career-high 55 points from Kawhi Leonard, and lost to the Utah Jazz on a go-ahead bucket from Keyonte George in the game before that.\n\nWith the Lakers missing several key players, the Pistons have the edge to snap the short losing streak before it gets out of hand.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham is averaging 26.5 points per game this season, and he's hit the Over on this scoring line in 15 of 29 games, including two straight. He's scored 26+ in 10 of 17 games on the road, and he's reached that mark in four of his last six outside of Little Caesars Arena.\n\nLeBron James Over 35.5 points + rebounds + assists\n\nCade Cunningham Over 25.5 points\n\nSpread: Pistons -2.5 (-110) | Lakers +2.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Pistons -140 | Lakers +120\n\nOver/Under: Over 232 (-110) | Under 232 (-110)\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have hit the Game Total Over in 34 of their last 55 games (+10.90 Units / 18% ROI).

    "fullText": "Real Madrid continue to set the benchmark in European football, sitting atop the latest UEFA club coefficient rankings ahead of Bayern Munich and Inter Milan. The standings, calculated based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, once again underline Madrid’s sustained dominance on the continental stage.\n\nAccording to the figures published by UEFA, Real Madrid lead the rankings with 131,500 points, a significant margin over second-placed Bayern Munich (124,250) and Inter Milan (121,250). The top six is rounded out by Manchester City (117,750), Liverpool (115,500), and reigning Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain (109,500).\n\nThe UEFA club coefficient is determined by results in the Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League over a rolling five-year period. During that time, Real Madrid have lifted the Champions League trophy twice, a key factor in their commanding position at the top of the rankings.\n\nThe list also highlights the balance of power across Europe’s major leagues. Among the top ten clubs, there are:\n\nTwo Spanish teams: Real Madrid (1st) and Barcelona (9th)\n\nThree German teams: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, and Bayer Leverkusen\n\nThree English teams: Manchester City, Liverpool, and Arsenal\n\nOne French team: Paris Saint-Germain\n\nFor Real Madrid, the numbers are less a surprise than a confirmation. Across eras, managers, and squads, the club continues to turn European nights into a competitive advantage. While others rise and fall with cycles of success, Madrid’s consistency over the last five years reinforces their reputation as the defining force in European football.",

With the transfer portal opening on Jan. 2, and only lasting for two weeks, it will be imperative to make a strong and immediate impact.\n\nThe first step to shoring up the roster is evaluating the members of MSU's roster that will be retained, while identifying the needs to plug holes in the starting lineup.\n\nTaking a look at the position groups on the Spartans roster, it will distinguish who the team may be pursuing when the portal opens at the turn of the new year.\n\nAfter breaking down the offensive roster, the time has come to look at the specialists, and what new special teams coordinator LeVar Woods is going to have deal with for his first season in East Lansing.\n\nNow, the Spartans are going to have to deal with the loss of Ryan Eckley to the NFL Draft and Martin Connington to the transfer portal, shaking up the room big time.\n\nOutlook: Luckily, Michigan State has a very good, young long snapper in Wills, who can lock down the position that's importance is very under the radar. Unluckily, the staff needs both a kicker and a punter out of the transfer portal (or the 2026 recruiting class) because both positions are vacant on the depth chart.\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "Recently, I migrated the services I host to an enterprise server (a Dell R740) running from my home.\nThis is the latest significant step in my homelab, where I can both experiment and host production services.\nThis is a good excuse to make a technical retrospective of how it all started and evolved into what it is today.\n\nMy homelab journey began around 2016, when I was 15. Back then,\nall I wanted was to host a personal website. I had no idea what a \"homelab\" was,\nnor did I know that you could host a website from a home connection\nusing ordinary hardware. I ended up using Hostinger,\na web hosting service that offered a free plan at the time. It included a free\nsubdomain which I happily accepted. That's how valou3433.pusku.com became my very first website.\n\nHosting a website was mostly about proving to myself that I could do it, and partly about showing off to friends\n(as well as sharing simple, fun projects I had built at the time). When I received\na Raspberry Pi as a gift (for my birthday or Christmas, I can't recall) and realized\n(thanks to previous experience with Minecraft server hosting) that I could host my\nwebsite on it, I immediately started configuring it that way.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Model B (or 1B), one of the first low-cost consumer Single Board Computers (SBC).\nEssentially, a board with an integrated CPU, RAM and I/O that can act as\na full computer; or in my case, a mini-server.\n\nWikipedia, CC-BY-SA 3.0\n\nThis became my de facto first homelab, allowing me to learn how to configure a web server,\nand leaving me wanting more. Before long, I was also running an FTP server, which I\nused for file sharing between computers as well as backups. It turned out to\nbe disastrous, as the SD cards I used with the Pi got corrupted multiple times;\nbut it was really fun!\n\nAfter high school, I entered a French prépa (classes préparatoires), a two-year\nintensive program preparing students for competitive entrance exams for engineering schools. It\nwas mostly math and physics, which didn't leave much time for personal projects.\n\nHowever, with COVID, my second year became quite unusual: France was in full lockdown\njust before exams, and some were canceled; so I decided to retake it. My third\nyear was lighter and finally allowed me to spend time on personal projects again.\n\nI also had my first apartment at that time, and quickly bought an old NAS server\nto share files between my computers, including laptops and machines at my mom's house.\n\nMy first NAS (Network Attached Storage) server. Basically, a box where you insert\ndisks, connect a network cable, and it makes the files available over the network.\n\nThe NAS was a D-Link DNS-323, released in 2006, featuring a 500MHz ARM CPU and 64 MiB of RAM.\nIt ran a proprietary operating system, and after hacking it\nto install a stripped-down Linux distribution, it became somewhat unusable.\nThe file sharing was outdated and slow, and I didn't have enough RAM to even hope installing applications. I clearly needed something more\npowerful.\n\nSoon after, I built my first real home server:\n\nUnboxing all the parts before assembly\n\nAt the time, I was using Arch Linux on my laptop and decided that it would be a good idea to use\nit on the server too.\nI set it up, and natively installed software: a web server, Jellyfin, Transmission torrent client, and Nextcloud.\n\nDeploying applications natively turned out to be a management nightmare. The deploying part was not that bad, but it needed\nextra steps like installing and configuring dependencies, and editing configuration files directly.\nOnce everything was set up, through Arch Linux packages or AUR packages, keeping the server up to date was the difficult part.\nI remember a specific issue I had where Jellyfin needed an older version of the .NET runtime, but another app needed a newer\none, and they were both conflicting. This was not the only issue, and overall, deploying applications natively does not\nseem like a good idea in modern times for a setup that isn't 'basic' like a simple web stack.\n\nThe server stayed in my apartment and worked well for a year. During summer, I moved\nback to my mom's house, then to Rennes for studies in a studio apartment, leaving the\nserver behind.\n\nFast-forward a year, I met my girlfriend in Rennes, and we decided to move in together.\nThis allowed for a larger apartment, with enough room for a new server. I ended up\nbuying a Lenovo P330 Tower SFF.\n\nHaving done more research this time, I wanted to try Proxmox. I installed it on that server,\nand started with LXC containers; first manually,\nthen with community-scripts.\n\nProxmox VE is an operating system based on Linux Debian, that provides a web interface allowing to manage QEMU-KVM hardware-accelerated virtual machines (VMs) and LinuX Containers (LXC). LXC is a technology using Linux kernel features (CGroups, kernel namespaces, chroots) to provide 'system containers', isolated but sharing the same kernel. Like a virtual machine, but with less isolation and less overhead.\n\nI started using software like Pi-Hole (ad-blocking DNS server), reverse proxies, and more\nadvanced services like the *arr stack, Photoprism, Gitea,\nHome Assistant, NodeRed, Syncthing\nand others.\n\nGiven the 'SFF' nature of that first server, hard drive support was quite limited. I wanted to level-up my local storage\ncapacity, so I decided to build a NAS server that would look more professional. I made a few mistakes on the way, but it was\na good experience overall. I documented the build process in a YouTube video, which, unfortunately for my English-speaking\nreaders, is in French.\n\nI use the TrueNAS operating system (Debian-based) for my NAS.\nI set up multiple ZFS pools, with a mirror of two 4 TB hard drives\nfor my personal data, a 12 TB hard drive for disposable data and a mirror of two 128 GB SSDs for fast application data. I also\nset up off-site backups to my old server, still at my mom's house, using ZFS replication.\n\nThis also meant that I now had two servers, and needed to set up fast networking between them. I bought and learned to use 10Gbit\nSFP+ cards, fiber optic cables and modules.\n\nTo connect the servers and my computers, I bought a QNAP QSW-M408-4C managed switch. It had 4 SFP+/RJ45 combo 1/2.5/5/10 Gbps ports,\nand 8 RJ45 1 Gbps ports. It is a wonderful switch, but was a bit noisy, so I replaced the stock fan with a Noctua.\nIt still serves me well, and given the many possible speeds, it is a useful switch.\n\nThe QNAP QSW-M408-4C (image credits: QNAP)\n\nI also wanted to advertise my DNS server over DHCP, and wanted to get rid of my ISP-provided router.\nI bought a Banana PI BPI-R4, which I use as router with OpenWRT to this day.\nIt is quite useful: advertises Pi-Hole as DNS server automatically, can manage different VLANs (virtual\nsub-networks) for regular use, servers, guests, and IoT devices; and can act as a Wireguard VPN peer.\n\nThe BananaPi BPI-R4. Don't worry, I have it in an enclosure :)\n\nThat last part is interesting for two reasons. First, I sometimes want to access home services while away.\nThe easiest solution would be to expose the service to the internet, which I sometimes do for public-facing projects\n(for example: this website). However, this means that if there is a security issue with\nthe app, anyone could take advantage of it. For most services (like my personal photo gallery Photoprism), I don't\nwant to have them publicly accessible. There are many known solutions for this (Cloudflare Tunnels for example), but my personal take is just to connect to my local\nnetwork with a VPN. This way, I can access the services but also the servers directly, as if I was always at home.\nIt has downsides (if you want to share this to other users, they need to know how to configure a VPN), but it works for me.\nSome solutions (like Tailscale) allow to have a nice UI and client to manage the VPN settings and\ncredentials, but I'm fine with editing Wireguard configurations by hand (or using OpenWRT Wireguard integration).\n\nAnother use of Wireguard is site-to-site VPN. My old server, still at my mom's house, is useful for off-site backups.\nIt is directly reachable from my network as the router will route packets through Wireguard automatically, without any\nconfiguration needed on the client. My local IP range is something like '10.1.0.0/16', and the second site, my mom's house,\nhas IP addresses under '10.2.0.0/16'. The OpenWRT routers on both sides have special rules to route those IPs through Wireguard.\n\nThere are a ton of interesting things around networking, but I'm still very much a beginner in the matter. As long as that\npart worked for connecting my two servers, I was able to move on and use them to deploy more services.\n\nFor a while, I was happy with that setup; but after a bit of time I stumbled upon an application that\nwas only distributed as an OCI image. I did not know much about Docker at the time, but I quickly had\nto learn about it.\n\nDocker is a software solution allowing for application containers.\nUnlike LXC/system containers, an application container typically only ships what is needed to run a specific application.\nFor example, it would not contain systemd, nor system tools, but only the libraries needed to run the app. This allows\nfor easy deployment (and distribution) of applications, as easy as docker run app:latest (if the developer ships an OCI\n\nThe Open Container Initiative (OCI) defines container runtime, image format, and distribution.\nDocker can run and pull OCI images, in an OCI-compliant way.\n\nAt first, it felt awkward. I had one LXC container running a Docker instance for each Dockerized app.\nIt felt off to SSH into those machines to copy docker-compose.yml files and start containers with\ndocker compose up.\n\nHowever, after a while, mostly after seeing this video, it started to click.\nI started managing my repo of compose files, had one large virtualized Docker instance, and could deploy\ndirectly from my laptop using Docker contexts.\n\nLike in the video, I also learned to use Docker Swarm and Gitea actions to deploy my own Nuxt.js application,\nBuildPath.\n\nI loved the idea of automatic deployment, checked out in git, automatically managed by a controller.\n\nLearning about this kind of deployment naturally led me to hear about GitOps practices, that are mostly adopted\nfor Kubernetes deployments. So I had to learn Kubernetes.\n\nKubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications (from kubernetes.io). Essentially, it is a container orchestrator, not only running containers like Docker but also\nscheduling them on multiple nodes, managing their lifetime, external connections with load balancing, and many more.\n\nI started by deploying a VM with k3s, since it was presented to me as \"the Kubernetes distribution that is the\neasiest to use\". I quickly deployed example services, using manifests, but nothing felt \"GitOps\", only\ndeclarative, and only for the services.\n\nThis is when I discovered Talos Linux and FluxCD (as well as ArgoCD).\n\nTalos Linux is a minimalist, immutable Linux distribution designed for Kubernetes. Everything, including the OS, is managed declaratively; and the only programs bundled or installable are the Kubernetes executables and libraries.\n\nFluxCD is a tool keeping a cluster in sync with a Git repository (or other sources). It deploys or deletes services automatically,\nafter each commit/push, applying the declared configuration checked out in Git.\n\nTalos allowed me to have everything, including the OS, managed in a declarative way. Flux allowed the services\nto be deployed and synced automatically from a git repository. It was everything I wanted, so I started to use it.\nThat was the start of my homeprod repository.\n\nKubernetes also has formidable features and tooling, allowing for a much better quality-of-life than docker. For example,\nwith Docker, when deploying a new service 'appxyz', and adding the Traefik (reverse-proxy) annotation 'host=appxyz.lan', I still\nhave to go to my local DNS server (Pi-Hole) and add a binding for 'appxyz.lan'. On Kubernetes, with ExternalDNS, creating the ingress will directly create the DNS mapping in Pi-Hole. Nice!\n\nThere are a lot more interesting features: from a consumer perspective, Helm charts are wonderful (even though they seem hard\nto write). The only part left to configure is the app configuration, unlike with docker-compose where you have to manually\nspecify which database container you want to run, which Redis, ... The only downside is that the Helm chart setup is more\nverbose.\n\nI still have a lot to learn about Kubernetes, and consider myself far from an experienced user.\n\nI still had one issue: I was deploying the Talos VM by hand on my Proxmox host. This felt inconsistent, knowing that\neverything else was managed in the repo by controllers. This is when I discovered Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) is managing infrastructure (virtual machines, for example) declaratively, as\ncode files, instead of in a procedural way (using commands or interfaces to deploy). For example, instead\nof interacting with a cloud dashboard to request and configure a new VM, you would modify a file adding a VM\ndefinition and configuration and then call a controller to reconcile the real infrastructure.\n\nTerraform is such a controller and language, that supports providers like AWS, Azure or even Proxmox.\n\nI quickly wrote my first Terraform files, that would deploy and kickstart my Talos VM, as well as a few others.\n\nExtract of the Terraform code file used to deploy the Talos Linux VM on Proxmox\n\nIn the meantime, I had done the terrible mistake of installing the eBay app on my phone. I\ndiscovered listings for used enterprise rack servers, and immediately bought one as a test, but quickly discovered\nthat the noise made it unusable in an apartment.\n\nFortunately, my girlfriend and I later moved from Rennes to Toulouse, and found a small house, with a small garden that had an independent room. That was all the justification I needed to start\nlooking for a rack. I found one on Leboncoin, a French website for used goods,\nfor cheap.\n\nInstalling the empty rack in the now server room. It came with a good UPS, which I still use today.\nAs you can see, I'm behind it trying to wire everything up.\n\nThe rack, populated with previous rack servers as well as the P330 and the NAS.\n\nAfter a while, I also bought the server I'm using today: a Dell PowerEdge R740.\n\nThis server has impressive specifications:\n\nI'm currently finishing the migration of every service from my old P330 to the R740. I'm also migrating the NAS,\nas I now have a rack-mounted disk enclosure with an HBA card.\n\nThe Dell PowerEdge R740 (2U server)\n\nThe 3D-printed disk enclosure I use with the R740 for my virtual NAS (still missing a few pieces on the picture).\n\nThe R740 is powerful enough to act as a build environment, using ephemeral VMs, which is very useful\nfor my work at Canonical. It also includes iDRAC (Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller), Dell's implementation of IPMI for remote management.\n\nIPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a specification for independent management of a system. For example, with IPMI,\nyou can shutdown but also power on a system, set virtual cd-rom drives from ISO images for operating system installation, send remote mouse or keyboard events and watch video output of the server. Usually, a KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) can have the same functionality when plugged in consumer hardware, like the PiKVM, NanoKVM or others.\n\nMy Kubernetes setup migrated seamlessly to the new server: I just updated some Terraform variables, redeployed Talos (applying the new Terraform configuration), and Flux pulled everything automatically. But my Docker setup still required manual redeploys from compose files, which felt out of place.\n\nFortunately, a similar GitOps workflow is theoretically possible for Docker, even if it supports a lot less features than Kubernetes\nout of the box. SwarmCD is a project aiming at giving the same kind of experience for\nDocker Swarm that FluxCD or ArgoCD are giving for Kubernetes (i.e. a GitOps workflow, basically). I'm currently using an\nexperimental branch of that project, and even contributed to add support for some of my specific workflows. It is\nstill far from something like FluxCD, but provides really interesting functionality. Just like with Talos, I can use Terraform\nto deploy and kickstart SwarmCD.\n\nAnother thing that motivated me to move to a more powerful server is the ability to run local AI models.\nI had three use cases in mind:\n\nI bought a used RTX 3060 12 GB for cheap (on Leboncoin as well), but of course it didn't fit in my SFF server. I used another computer\nfor a while, and only powered it on for experiments. I feel like I'm ready to have some of it more permanent (for example, a tiny model connected to Home Assistant), and the R740 had space for that GPU, which is great. I can also add a lot of system RAM, which\nis unfortunately necessary for most interesting models.\n\nThe RTX 3060 12GB installed inside the R740 server (top left). I had to buy a specific power cable that goes from the motherboard to the GPU (not shown here).\n\nIt has been a wonderful journey!\n\nFrom a simple Raspberry Pi with defaults SSH/web/FTP servers, I went to a real home server where I could natively deploy\napplications. It then evolved into a Proxmox server, where I learned about virtualization and system containers. I also\nlearned about Docker, and then Kubernetes, GitOps, and IaC.\n\nPassmark benchmark score for different servers of my Homelab, as well as my laptops for comparison\n\nI'm now using a full-blown rack server, but I'm not sure I'll stop there. Some people are\nbecoming their own internet service provider / autonomous system,\ndoing crazy home automation, or even have a multi-site homelab.\n\nI would really like to try all of that, but I'm currently finishing migration to the new server and learning about\nIPv6 and related technologies (NAT64, ...). My issue with IPv6 right now is that my ISP does give me a prefix, but I cannot delegate it to my router (the ISP-provided box does not support prefix delegation); which is something I will need to work around.\n\nI still have a lot to learn and a lot to do to make my homelab clean.\n\nYou can follow/check out everything on my homeprod repository!",

    "title": "Logarithmic Scales of Pleasure and Pain (2019)",
    "description": "TL;DR\nBased on: the characteristic distribution of neural activity, personal accounts of intense pleasure and pain, the way various pain scales have…",
    "fullText": "Thank for commenting. First of all I agree that the claims of (A) and (B) do need to be distinguished, and I admit I didn't make that conceptual distinction very clear in the article. I agree that the most important takeaway from the piece is (B), and I also think that this alone is already enough to challenge EA's prioritization methods (i.e. ultra-painful experiences are completely flying under the radar from the point of view of QALYs and similar metrics; reducing the incidence of cluster headaches, migraines, kidney stones, etc. could be an extremely cost-effective EA objective).\n\nWith that said, I would claim that (1) the article does actually provide evidence for (A), (2) taking this seriously clarifies a lot of puzzling facts about experience and how it is reported, and (3) understanding that pain and pleasure follows a long-tail (most likely a log-normal distribution) gives us a new principled way to approach cause prioritization.\n\nI understand the fact that the pain scales of stings and cluster headaches are *by construction* logarithmic. But you have to understand that such a scale would only ever be \"filled to the top\" if experiences actually differed in intensity also by the same amount. The article (and presentation, which I strongly recommend you watch) explain that all of the following are consistent with the pain scales (as reported!) are actually logarithmic:\n\n(a) the characteristic distribution of neural activity is log-normal, and under the modest assumption that intensity of experience is roughly proportional (or at least polynomially proportional) to intensity of experience, that entails the distribution of intensity is also log-normal.\n\n(b) the above can be further understood as a kind of \"neuronal weather\" (see the \"avalanches\" metaphor in the video presentation)\n\n(c1) there are few categories of experiences that capture most of the extremely good and extremely bad sensations\n\n(c2) there is consistency in the deference judgements of the quality of experience (as seen in the deference graph), and importantly\n\n(c3) The ratio of \"1st worst or best experience vs. 2nd worst or best experience\" fits a log-normal distribution and it does not fit a normal distribution.\n\nFor the above reasons, bringing up the Fechner-Weber is not, I would claim, a red-herring. Rather, I think it ties together the whole argument. Here is why:\n\nI understand that Fechner-Weber's law maps physical intensity to subjective intensity, and that valence is not externally driven a lot of the time. But you may have missed the argument I'm making here. And that is that in one interpretation of the law, a pre-conscious process does a log transform on the intensity of the input and that by the time we are aware of it, what we become aware of are the linear differences in our experience. In the alternate interpretation of the law, which I propose, the senses (within the window of adaptation) translate the intensity of the input into an equivalent intensity of experience. And the reason *why* we can only detect multiplicative differences in the input *is because* we can only notice consciously multiplicative differences in the intensity of experience. Do you see what I am saying? In this account, the fact that people would naturally and spontaneously use a logarithmic scale to report their level of pain is a simple implication of the fact that you can only definitively tell that \"the pain got worse\" when it got 10% worse and not when it became 1 unit worse (which soon becomes hard to notice when you talk about experiences with e.g. 1000 pain units per second).\n\nIn other words, the scales are logarithmic because we can only notice with confidence multiplicative increments in the intensity of experience. And while this is fine and does not seem to have strong implications on the lower end of the scale, it very quickly escalates, to the point where by the time you are in 7/10 pain you live in a world with orders of magnitude more pain units per second than you did when you were in 2/10 pain.\n\nFinally, you really need the logarithmic scales to make room for the ultra-intense levels of pleasure and pain that I highlighted in the \"existence of extremes\" section. If people reported their pain on a linear scale, they would quickly run into the problem that they cannot describe even something as painful as a broken bone, let along something like a cluster headache.",

    "fullText": "A Wall Street veteran warned jubilant silver traders to be careful after a searing rally in the precious metal's price — days before it went into reverse.\n\nWriting on X over the weekend, Peter Brandt congratulated those who've won big by betting on silver and platinum in recent months, but cautioned the market could quickly turn on them.\n\n\"Being right is fun,\" he wrote. \"But know this -- moves can far exceed anything expected. And tops come quickly when they come. And retracements are almost always full.\"\n\nEarly on Monday, the market did indeed turn. Silver breached $80 an ounce for the first time before falling to around $70 by the market's close. They rebounded 10% to around $78 on Tuesday. Silver futures have surged by over 150% this year.\n\nMonday's plunge followed a decision by exchange operator CME to raise margin requirements for trading various metals contracts, which forced traders to stump up more cash to place their bets.\n\nIf you are long Silver and/or Platinum, I say \"Well done.\"\nCongrats. Perhaps this is your first futures market trade. Being right is fun.\nBut know this -- moves can far exceed anything expected\nAnd tops come quickly when they come\nAnd retracements are almost always full pic.twitter.com/w32o9OuXKj\n\nBrandt, who's been trading commodities for nearly 50 years and has more than 840,000 followers on X, also struck a wary tone in a Monday afternoon post on X following silver's drop.\n\nHe wrote that in virtually every market cycle, even the \"stubborn bulls\" who've sworn they'll never sell inevitably reach a point where they \"no longer care if price goes to zero or a million, they have had enough pain and they want out.\"\n\nBrandt said he's \"not sure\" the silver market is there yet. \"Time will tell,\" he added.\n\nTrue story\nI've been through many many many huge bull market cycles in metals, grains, softs, livestock, alt coins, et al\nThere is a point when late-to-buy bulls swear that they will never get out -- that they will hang on even if price goes to zero\nIn almost every case the low…\n\nSilver, gold, and other precious metals have soared to new highs this year as falling interest rates have boosted their appeal relative to cash and bonds.\n\nSome traders have bought silver to gain exposure to the AI boom, as the metal is a key component in AI infrastructure, such as microchips and data centers. Because it conducts electricity well, it's used in circuit boards, switches, EVs, and batteries, which is also driving demand for the metal right now.\n\nInvestors have also piled into precious metals as hedges against geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty, which threatens to weaken currencies such as the dollar and weigh on other assets such as stocks.\n\nIn a separate post late Monday on X, Brandt defended his cautious attitude toward the silver rally, noting that he has been trading silver since it was priced below $4 an ounce in the 1970s and has traded as much as 200,000 ounces in a single order.\n\n\"Yet, I am jealous because there is an entire generation of Z babies trading on Silver on laptops from their mommy's basements that know everything there is to know about Silver,\" he posted, followed by a succession of laughing-while-crying emojis.\n\nBrandt also dismissed the idea that silver's price boom reflects a structural imbalance between supply and demand that will forestall any price decline.\n\n\"It has never been different,\" he wrote. \"Never will be. So enjoy it now.\"\n\n\"This price action has NOTHING to do with supply shortages,\" he wrote in another post. \"This now is a game of money.\"",

    "description": "Toys R Us has been the subject of multiple revival efforts since it ended operations in 2018.",
    "fullText": "The latest phase of the toy store chain's comeback came this holiday season as Toys R Us stores popped up at a handful of malls around the US. The temporary stores are part of a broader revitalization opportunity by brand management company WHP and Go! Retail Group.\n\nIt's the latest example of how the once-dominant chain is trying to make a comeback.\n\nToys R Us used to operate around 700 stores in the US. Then, after years of faltering financial results, the chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy before deciding to liquidate and close its operations in 2018.\n\nSince then, there have been multiple efforts to revive the brand, including opening locations within Macy's department stores and teaming up with Amazon.\n\nHere's a closer look at the history of the historic toy company, from its founding just after World War 2 to the revival attempt.\n\nLazarus was inspired by what was then the emerging post-war \"baby boom\" and sought a way to capitalize.\n\nIn the subsequent years, Lazarus began expanding into toys and the company officially adopted the name Toys R Us in 1957.\n\nKids and their parents would line up for hours to meet their favorite stars — and do a little shopping while they were there.\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia.com, he transitioned from chief executive to head the Toys R Us division, which was already thriving at profits of $12 million.\n\nThe mascot became synonymous with the brand and its advertising campaigns over the decades.\n\nLazarus handled the restructuring process, according to USA Today.\n\nIn 1978, it was able to file its initial public offering.\n\nThe Toys R Us empire was steadily expanding.\n\nThe move signified a series of woes for the brand, including high executive turnover and the looming pressure of ecommerce.\n\nThe stores saw success with selling baby-related merchandise.\n\nIn the Big Apple, Toys R Us opened its iconic multi-story store with a fully functioning Ferris wheel in 2001.\n\nIn fact, according to The Associated Press, in 1998, Walmart had already surpassed the company as the top US toy seller.\n\nAll 146 Kids R Us stores were closed in 2003.\n\nAccording to USA Today, the plan was to boost Toys R Us sales and position the company for a stock offering that would allow investors to cash out.\n\nThat same year, it bought KB Toys and the famed New York City toy store, F.A.O. Schwarz.\n\nHowever, by 2013 it withdrew from the process due to sales slumps, according to USA Today.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Brandon marked the fourth CEO over the course of 16 years \"tasked with turning the company around.\"\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the chain lost significant traction to ecommerce giants like Amazon, Target, and Walmart.\n\nThe chain hoped to gain control of its debt and continue to operate its 1,600 stores around the world as normal, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, the decision threatened the jobs of the 33,000 people employed by Toys R Us at the time.\n\nThat same year, the company issued an emotional goodbye as it prepared to permanently shutter its Toys R Us and Babies R Us websites.\n\n\"We encourage you to stop by your local store and take full advantage of the deep discounts and deals available,\" the message read. \"Thank you for your business and support over the years.\"\n\nIt was later announced that gift-card holders could use any remaining funds at Bed Bath & Beyond stores, according to Business Insider.\n\nHowever, the offer was ultimately rejected by Toys R Us.\n\nThe chain strategized to overtake Toys R Us's legacy by adding mass amounts of baby-related products to its inventory.\n\nThe stores would sell popular toys directly from manufacturers, meaning that any sales would directly go to the toy companies rather than Toys R Us.\n\nInstead, users would be directed to make purchases from Target's website.\n\nThe haunted houses were a far cry from the joy-filled Toys R Us stores of the 1990s.\n\nCNBC reported in January 2021 that the retailer was facing hardships due to dwindling in-store sales amid the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the chain's last two remaining stores in the US officially shuttered for good, bringing an end to a years-long ordeal to attempt to revitalize the brand.\n\nThe final stores were in Texas and New Jersey, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\"Consumer demand in the toy category and for Toys 'R' Us remains strong and we will continue to invest in the channels where the customer wants to experience our brand,\" a Tru Kids spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nThe Toys R Us in-store locations opened in time for the holiday season that year.\n\nThe stores, operated by Go! Retail Group, include eight flagship locations and 20 seasonal pop-ups around the US.\n\nAlthough the pop-ups use the Toys R Us name and slogans, they also feature a different product selection compared to the Toys R Us stores of years past, Business Insider found during a recent visit to one store in Maryland. The store included a wide selection of calendars, for example.\n\nWhile some shoppers were able to check out the brand's pop-up stores, the chain has far fewer locations than it did a decade ago.",

    "description": "\"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary learned about the \"signal and noise\" ratio for productivity from Apple founder Steve Jobs.",
    "fullText": "\"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary has learned many things from the CEOs and world leaders he rubs shoulders with, but one of his most important daily rituals comes from an iconic innovator: Steve Jobs.\n\nO'Leary told Business Insider that a goal technique he uses every day came straight from studying the Apple founder. He picked it up after working alongside Jobs in the mid-1990s, when O'Leary's educational software company The Learning Company was working with Apple to get the Mac computer into schools.\n\n\"He believed that you needed to do three things, and you had to get them done every day,\" O'Leary said of Jobs.\n\n\"You need a ratio of at least 70% signal, which are the three things, and the 30% can be noise — whatever is going to stop you from getting the three things done,\" he continued. \"So I pick three things I want to get done that day, and I don't let anything get in the way until those three things are done.\"\n\nO'Leary said one of the three things he has to do every day is exercise. He usually wakes up at 5 a.m. and works out for over an hour, usually biking about 12 miles.\n\n\"I have to do that; otherwise, bad things happen,\" he said.\n\nOn the noise side, part of the 30% that gets in O'Leary's way is his overflowing inbox. It's become such a distraction that he's stopped trying to keep up with email.\n\n\"I don't do emails anymore because I get anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 a day,\" O'Leary said. \"I've tried every system to take the crap out, but over the years, my email address has gotten out there, and so it's just a constant stream of noise and garbage. As we speak, I see the emails just pouring in. I'm never going to get to them, so I don't try.\"\n\nThe \"Marty Supreme\" star says in his line of work, it's best to focus on what he really wants to accomplish and block out all the noise.\n\n\"In entrepreneurship, and certainly in what I do today as an investor, there is no holiday, there's no workday — that doesn't exist,\" O'Leary said. \"It's what you want to do with your time.\"",

    "fullText": "I've been using the same mac-and-cheese recipe for almost two decades.\n\nInitially, I prepared it in a huge baking tray for parties, but I've since adapted it into a one-pot, stovetop recipe. To this day, my teenage son makes it for himself at least once a week.\n\nCurious about how the flavor, texture, and cook time compared, I tested the same recipe using three different appliances: the microwave, oven, and stove.\n\nFor each method, I used an 8-ounce bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1 ½ cups of milk, one box of medium pasta shells, and 2 tablespoons of butter.\n\nThe stovetop method uses the fewest kitchen tools of the three since the cheese sauce and pasta go in the same pot, leaving me with less to clean up.\n\nTo make my mac and cheese on the stove, I started with a roux, which is a cooking staple that combines fat and flour. It helps thicken the cheese sauce, giving it a creamy consistency.\n\nAs soon as the fat and flour formed a paste, I whisked in the milk.\n\nThe key is to let the milk simmer until it starts to thicken, then whisk in the cheese over low heat. After that, I removed the sauce from the heat as soon as the cheese melted to prevent it from getting too thick.\n\nThe stovetop produced the creamiest mac and cheese. Taking the time to make the sauce first ensured that the cheese was completely melted and not stringy.\n\nI liked the sauce's thickness and the pasta's tender-but-firm consistency. Even better, the leftover stovetop mac and cheese maintained the same texture and taste when reheated.\n\nWhen I've baked mac and cheese in the past, I used at least double the amount of cheese, plus some extra milk.\n\nBut for the sake of consistency throughout the test, I stuck to the same measurements I used in the microwave and on the stovetop.\n\nI intentionally undercooked the pasta before putting it in the oven to keep it from overcooking during the baking period. Before placing it on the rack, I dotted butter on top.\n\nThen, I baked it for a total of 35 minutes (20 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered).\n\nBaking the mac and cheese gave it a rich cheese flavor and a crispy top layer. The cheese melted well, although somewhat unevenly, leaving some pieces more coated than others.\n\nI really enjoyed the flavor and consistency of the oven-baked mac and cheese the most, but it took 35 minutes to cook and didn't reheat as well as the version I made on the stovetop.\n\nWhen I've previously cooked pasta in the microwave, it took at least 10 minutes to finish, with pauses built in to mix the shells and cheese every couple of minutes.\n\nSo for this test, I decided to first boil the shells on the stove until they were slightly underdone. To make a roux alternative, I combined microwaved butter with flour, then whisked in milk I'd heated in the microwave.\n\nI mixed the ingredients in a glass bowl and microwaved the mac and cheese covered for five minutes. The cheese still hadn't melted, so I stirred it and microwaved it for another two minutes.\n\nEven though I added the extra step of boiling the pasta before microwaving it, this method felt like the lowest lift.\n\nThe microwave got the job done, but the cheese didn't melt evenly. Instead of turning into a smooth sauce, there were specks of cheese coating the pasta. This gave the mac and cheese a thick and dry consistency.\n\nWithout the stovetop cream sauce, the pasta absorbed the milk as it cooked in the microwave. It lost the cheddar cheese's sharpness (which, in my opinion, is the best part of the dish), and I thought it tasted like milk.\n\nThe oven-baked mac and cheese had the best flavor and texture when served fresh.\n\nThe downside is that it took longer to cook, and cleaning the baking dish was a serious undertaking. Even so, I'd stick with this method if I were making mac and cheese for a party since it's easy to prep.\n\nThe microwave version took about the same amount of time to cook as the stovetop mac and cheese, but it wasn't as creamy and didn't have the sharp flavor I got from the stovetop and oven.\n\nAll in all, the stovetop mac and cheese was the creamiest and did a wonderful job retaining its texture, flavor, and consistency after reheating compared to the microwave and baked mac and cheeses.\n\nIf I'm making the recipe for myself or someone else in my family and want to use minimal dishes, I'll stick to the stove.",

    "description": "Chip Wilson, Lululemon's founder, isn't afraid to speak his mind about his former company, which he still holds an 8% stake in.",
    "fullText": "Lululemon's outspoken founder is used to making headlines with his interviews.\n\nDennis \"Chip\" Wilson founded the athleisure brand in 1998 and left the company in 2013 after a series of controversial remarks. Since his departure, the 70-year-old billionaire has continued to express his opinions about the brand.\n\nWith an 8% stake in the company, Wilson's wealth remains tied to Lululemon's performance. With shares underperforming compared to its peers over the last two years and a CEO set to leave in 2026, Lululemon is facing some challenges entering the new year.\n\nOn Monday, Wilson launched a proxy battle by nominating three new board members.\n\n\"My passion for the Lululemon Athletica muse has never changed, but I know this campaign for change cannot be about me,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"It is about recommitting Lululemon to genuine creative leadership that will re-establish a brand of enduring strength.\"\n\nLululemon released a statement in response to Wilson's nominations.\n\n\"Mr. Wilson has not been involved with the company for a decade, and since his departure, Lululemon has continued to adapt to the marketplace and lead the industry, building one of the most compelling growth stories in retail,\" the company said.\n\nHere are some quotes that show what Wilson has said publicly about Lululemon since leaving the company.\n\nLululemon said in December that CEO Calvin McDonald would leave his role at the end of January 2026 and named CFO Meghan Frank and CCO André Maestrini as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement.\n\nWilson was quick to criticize the change.\n\n\"As one of the largest active shareholders of Lululemon, I am deeply concerned about what appears to be a tremendous failure by the board to competently plan for the future and manage an effective succession process,\" Wilson said in a statement the day after the company's announcement.\n\nIn his statement announcing his board nominations on December 29, Wilson said that \"shareholders have no faith\" in the current board's ability to select a new CEO.\n\nIn October, Wilson penned an ad in The Wall Street Journal to criticize the athleisure brand's performance.\n\nIn the ad, he described Lululemon's \"loss of cool,\" blaming \"financed focused CEOs\" who, he said, don't know how to attract or motivate talent or understand great products.\n\nHe also compared Lululemon's \"decline\" to a \"plane crash\" and a \"sinking ship.\"\n\n\"Lululemon forgot its muse: the woman who inspires culture, not just follows it,\" he wrote.\n\nWilson implored the brand to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\"\n\nIn a Forbes interview published in January 2024, Wilson slammed the company's ads for featuring models that he described as \"sickly,\" \"unhealthy,\" and \"not inspirational.\"\n\n\"They're trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody,\" he said. \"And I think the definition of a brand is that you're not everything to everybody.\"\n\nHe also told the publication he didn't agree with Lululemon's \"whole diversity and inclusion thing.\"\n\nWilson previously sparked controversy when he was chairman of Lululemon for other remarks that suggested Lululemon was not for everyone.\n\nIn 2013, in response to criticism about Lululemon's leggings being too sheer, he told Bloomberg TV, \"Frankly, some women's bodies just don't actually work for it … It's really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it.\"\n\nHe stepped down as chairman of the company shortly after. He'd resigned as CEO in 2007.\n\n\"Chip Wilson does not speak for Lululemon, and his comments do not reflect our company views or beliefs,\" Lululemon said in a public statement around the time.\n\nWilson has been adamant that Lululemon should focus on its core demographic.\n\n\"Our success was exactly that 32-year-old single professional woman — highly disposable income, very fashionable, athletic,\" Wilson told Tony Robbins in an interview published in 2023.\n\nIn the 2023 interview with Robbins, Wilson gave Lululemon props for having an \"unbeatable\" economic engine.\n\n\"Nobody's been able to replicate the muscle of this vertical retailing model, which costs so much money to get into,\" he said.\n\nThe vertical retailing model, adopted by other athletic brands like On Running, eliminates third-party retailers like Foot Locker or Macy's from the business plan.\n\nWilson spoke in the 2023 interview with Robbins about the tension he had with board members before stepping down as chairman in 2013. He described them as \"Wall Street people\" who lacked creativity.\n\n\"Somebody in here has gotta stand for the employees. Somebody has gotta stand for the quality of the product. Nobody in here cares about it,\" Wilson said he told the board.\n\nHe said those remarks led to his departure.\n\n\"'I think you should all fire yourselves,'\" he said. \"And they fired me.\"\n\nIt is common for public companies to elect new board members regularly, and many of Lululemon's board of directors have changed since Wilson's remarks.",

    "fullText": "I'll never forget my first train cabin. Before I'd spent 140 hours on overnight trains in the US and Europe, I had no idea what to expect of my 30-hour journey from New York City to Miami in October 2021.\n\nFor my first overnight Amtrak trip, I was set on having a bed in a private space. So I spent $500 on a roomette accommodation — the cheapest private cabin I could find.\n\nThe 22.75-square-foot cabin contained two beds, a toilet, and basic amenities. Thanks to clever storage hacks, it felt like a tiny hotel room with no unused space.\n\nSee inside the most affordable Amtrak ride in a private cabin.\n\nInside the enclosed space with a sliding door, I found two seats, a table, and a bed above the seats that pulled down. The seats also pulled out into a bed.\n\nI thought this was a big step up from sitting in coach, where you get one train seat and sit with other passengers.\n\nI was also surprised to be able to control the temperature inside my roomette with a dial and air conditioning vents. I kept it cool, about 66 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nFor dinner, I had braised short ribs, mashed potatoes, and a hard roll. While I didn't love the meal as it came, I made a little sandwich out of the ingredients, which tasted better to me.\n\nI decided to try sleeping on the top bed. I thought the available blankets wrapped in plastic were surprisingly soft and comfortable.\n\nWhile I found the train movement through the night a little unsettling, I appreciated the dim, blue light on the wall next to me. It was my favorite feature of the roomette because it reminded me of my colorful night light at home.\n\nAfter 30 hours in a roomette, I would book the accommodation again. But for those looking for more room to stretch out, I recommend the Amtrak bedroom.",

    "description": "I stopped speaking to my mom years ago. I've learned that it's my job is to model regulation and support for my sons.",
    "fullText": "When I tell people that I'm estranged from my mom, I'm nearly always met with an apology. My reply is always to assure them it's OK, because ultimately, it is OK.\n\nGoing no contact with my mom six years ago was a difficult decision to make, but it has had an incredible impact on the way I show up as a parent to my sons, now 8 and 10.\n\nUltimately, I believe the decision to take a step back from my relationship with my mom has made me a better mother.\n\nOn the surface, my own childhood certainly looked idyllic. My dad worked, and my mom stayed home. I did well in school. I was involved. If I expressed interest in an activity, my mom signed me up. She schlepped me around town, to games and competitions, to art classes and orchestra practices. I stood out academically; my report cards always read \"a pleasure to have in class.\" I was a rule follower by nature, seemingly clinging to the order and structure that school offered me.\n\nAt home, I remember raised voices and arguments being the norm. I often busied myself with schoolwork and activities to avoid the chaos of home. It was a win-win. The adults in my life could point to my accomplishments as a sign of their success, and I could stay occupied in spaces that offered structure, praise for my efforts, and refuge from the discomfort that I remember feeling at home.\n\nNow that I'm a mother, I find myself looking back on childhood memories, discovering them colored by a new understanding of the dynamics that had played out. I can see a little girl so overwhelmed and flooded with feelings that she couldn't make sense of them.\n\nWhile I can now empathize a bit with my mother, who dealt with some extenuating circumstances that would be difficult for anyone to navigate, I also recognize that it was probably not the best environment for me to be in as a little girl.\n\nI now have a deeply feeling kid of my own, and boy, can we rile one another up. He quickly escalates when things aren't perfect, the tears and yelling so deeply familiar. I see myself in him, but it also feels different now. I know I can stop the cycle.\n\nI remember feeling such big feelings in such a small body as a child. Just like my son, the sobs came readily for me, too. Any frustration, any struggle, and it would rise in my chest, spilling out despite my best efforts. There wasn't anyone to guide me through making sense of it, but it doesn't need to be that way for my boys. I listen to them and support them.\n\nWhat I learned in unpacking my own past is that the cycle of rupture and repair doesn't have to continue. Distancing myself from my mother has made a new way of approaching life and motherhood a possibility. My job is to model regulation and support my sons, even when their feelings and struggles are hard.\n\nWhile I no longer resent my mom, I do wish she had done the work to save me from the burden I carried for so long. I hope that eventually my sons can look back and appreciate the work I'm putting in every day to make sure we have a long, healthy relationship that has us enjoying each other's company for many years.",

    "fullText": "This story is based on an interview with Brian Mazza, 41, who has appeared on the cover of \"Men's Health.\" Mazza was recently named \"Champion for Male Fertility Advocacy\" by the World Fertility Awards. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore we got married in 2014, my wife, Chloe Melas, a journalist, and I were very much aligned on wanting children in the future. It's a huge step for anybody in a relationship, but we agreed that it would be great to start a family together.\n\nThen, around a year after the wedding, we tried to get pregnant — without success.\n\nThe sense of disappointment each month was challenging and disheartening. Like anything else in life you want to accomplish, it becomes frustrating when it's not working out.\n\nIt wasn't ideal for both of us and caused a lot of issues, which weren't fun. It was a strain and kind of brutal.\n\nFortunately, we were able to find a good, straight-talking doctor who ran a series of tests. Chloe was found to have a diminished ovarian reserve, but they wanted to check me out, too.\n\nIt was awkward and strange. Everybody in the waiting room knew why you were there, which was fine, but then you were ushered into a room next to the secretary's desk. It felt a bit strange.\n\nMy test was back in 2016. Thankfully, there are now a lot of companies that allow you to sort everything out in your own home.\n\nThe results showed I had a low sperm count, which proved to be the primary cause of the issues. If someone asked if I felt guilty, embarrassed, or was worried that Chloe was resentful toward me, I'd answer yes.\n\nI was extremely fit, eating well, and doing everything to meet the expectations of an elite performer in life. I thought, \"What is getting in the way of this goal?\"\n\nI began to wonder if I'd done something in the past that was responsible. It wasn't the case, but I wanted to look at the full road map.\n\nThen, since I've always been a problem solver and a reverse engineer, I thought, \"How can we approach the situation?\"\n\nWe had no luck with intrauterine insemination (IUI) and moved on to IVF. The process was pretty easy from a male perspective because you are physically removed.\n\nStill, I went to every doctor's appointment to listen to the advice. It was hard to see Chloe go through what she did, but we tried to focus on the end result.\n\nWe didn't share our journey with family or friends at the time. It was to protect the situation and not feel like we were letting people down.\n\nThankfully, we got pregnant on our first round of IVF. We were thrilled, and it turned into elation when our son, Leo, was born in July 2017.\n\nWe went through the same process, and Luke arrived exactly two years later.\n\nHolding Leo and Luke in my arms was every dream that I'd ever dreamed. I'd wanted to become a father so much.\n\nI'm speaking up about male factor infertility because it's a topic that should be openly discussed. I hope that I'm helping to remove the stigma. It's useful when someone who has been through an experience like ours can share their story.\n\nAs the years pass, I find myself gazing at my boys — now 8 and 6 — with joy and wonder. They're bright, athletic, and kind. Chloe and I call them our miracles.",

    "fullText": "The younger members of the Kennedy family, one of the most famous political dynasties in the US, include authors, actors, and journalists.\n\nThe most famous members of the Kennedy family include former president John F. Kennedy, his wife and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and their son John F. Kennedy Jr, who tragically died in a plane crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in 1999 with his wife and sister-in-law.\n\nHowever, younger members of the Kennedy family, from the Schlossbergs to the Schwarzeneggers, have risen the ranks of American politics and are making names for themselves in film, philanthropy, and politics.\n\nHere are 12 young members of the Kennedy family.\n\nJoe Kennedy III, 45, is the grandson of Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nIn 2020, Kennedy, who attended Stanford University for his undergrad and Harvard Law School, lost the senate primary against Ed Markey, becoming the first Kennedy to lose an election in Massachusetts history.\n\nStill, he'd go on to serve as a United States representative for Massachusetts from 2013 to 2021 and he held the position of United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland from 2022 to 2024.\n\nKennedy first came to national attention in 2018 when he gave the Democratic Party's response to former President Donald Trump's State of the Union address.\n\nKennedy served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee while representing Massachusetts's 4th congressional district.\n\nHe supported Democratic efforts like the Green New Deal and protection for Dreamers and immigrants under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program.\n\nHe's also spoken out in favor of gun control. After a 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Kennedy said during an appearance on The View, \"We're not doing enough ... I can't even tell you how many times we have uttered our thoughts and prayers to the victims and survivors of gun violence, and thoughts aren't doing it.\"\n\nIn December 2012, he married Lauren Birchfield, a fellow Harvard-educated lawyer. The pair met in a Harvard Law School class taught by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and they now live in Newton, Massachusetts, with their two young children, CBS reported.\n\nHis twin brother, Matthew Rauch Kennedy, has stayed more out of the public eye, opting to study business instead, CNN reported.\n\nKatherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, 35, is the oldest daughter of actor and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and broadcast journalist Maria Shriver. Pratt's middle name, Eunice, is a nod to her maternal grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the younger sister of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Ted Kennedy.\n\nPratt has written several self-help and children's books, including her upcoming release, \"Kat and Brandy,\" which was inspired by her experience falling off a horse as a child.\n\nIn addition to writing, she is involved in animal rights advocacy and is an ambassador for Best Friends Animal Society and the ASPCA, according to her website. She's a dog mom to a rescue named Maverick, who inspired her first children's book, \"Maverick and Me.\"\n\nPratt's private life has also been a topic of interest in the press. She's married to actor Chris Pratt. Their first child, Lyla Maria, was born in August 2020, and their second daughter, Eloise Christina, was born in May 2022. The couple welcomed their son Ford in November 2024.\n\nPatrick Schwarzenegger, 32, is a model and actor who has appeared in many movies, TV shows, and music videos, including \"Midnight Sun,\" \"The Staircase, and \"Gen V.\" In 2019, he acted in the psychological horror film \"Daniel Isn't Real,\" produced by Elijah Wood. The movie also starred Miles Robbins, Susan Sarandon's son.\n\nMore recently, he had a starring role in season three of \"The White Lotus.\" He played Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family on vacation in Thailand.\n\nHe's also known for his brief relationship with Miley Cyrus in 2015. He's now married to model Abby Champion.\n\nSchlossberg, 32, is the youngest son of Caroline Kennedy, the former US ambassador to Japan and the only surviving child of John F. Kennedy, and Edwin Schlossberg, a designer and author.\n\nIn November, he announced would be campaigning for a congressional seat in New York City's 12th district.\n\n\"I'm not running because I have all the answers to our problems,\" he said in a video announcing his candidacy. \"I'm running because the people of New York 12 do. I want to listen to your struggles, hear your stories, amplify your voice, go to Washington, and execute on your behalf.\"\n\nHe was born in New York City and graduated from The Collegiate School, an all-boys private school in Manhattan, the New York Post reported. He later attended Yale University as an undergrad, and he graduated from Harvard in 2022. In 2023, Schlossberg told People he had passed the New York State Bar exam.\n\nSchlossberg makes frequent media appearances and has written for publications, with op-eds in The New York Times and The Washington Post.\n\n\"I'm inspired by my family's legacy of public service,\" Schlossberg said in his first live television interview on \"Today\" in 2017. \"It's something that I'm very proud of.\"\n\nHowever, Schlossberg has been criticized in recent years for his out-there videos on social media, with even some family members criticizing his \"trolling,\" particularly of his cousin Robert F. Kennedy, online, The New York Post reported.\n\n\"I hope he gets the help he needs,\" Kennedy's daughter, Kathleen \"Kick\" Kennedy, told The Post in February.\n\nTatiana Schlossberg died on December 30, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation announced. She was 35.\n\nIn November, Schlossberg wrote an essay for The New Yorker in which she shared that she had been diagnosed with terminal acute myeloid leukemia.

    "title": "Business leaders from Palmer Luckey to David Sacks react to California's proposed billionaire tax",
    "description": "Bill Ackman, Palmer Luckey, Garry Tan, and more are sharing their opinions on a California billionaire tax proposal.",
    "fullText": "Some of the biggest names in business are speaking up about California's billionaire tax proposal.\n\nThe measure proposed a one-time 5% tax for California residents whose assets exceed $1 billion. If the proposal receives enough signatures, it would appear on the state ballot in November.\n\nIf the proposal passes, the tax would apply retroactively to all California residents as of January 1, 2026.\n\nProposed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union, the bill attempts to fill a projected multibillion-dollar state budget deficit.\n\nCalifornia is home to some of the biggest companies — in both value and prestige — in the US. The state boasts Hollywood and Silicon Valley, although some of the industries' key players have relocated.\n\nIn a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom obtained by Business Insider, attorney Alex Spiro wrote that his clients would \"permanently relocate\" if the tax becomes law. Spiro has previously represented billionaires and celebrities.\n\nHere's how several business leaders and politicians have reacted to the tax proposal:\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Holdings wrote Monday on X that he was \"opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property,\" which can have \"unintended and negative consequences.\"\n\nHowever, he said he's in favor of a \"fairer tax system.\"\n\nFor example, Ackman wrote that an individual who had amassed a billion dollars or \n\n\"One shouldn't be able to live and spend like a billionaire and pay no tax,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nAs for California's \"budget problems,\" Ackman wrote that the issue wasn't a lack of tax revenue — it was about \"how the money is being spent.\"\n\nThe White House AI and crypto czar took aim at California's government in an X post on Sunday.\n\nRed states like Texas and Florida don't employ state income taxes, let alone wealth taxes, Sacks wrote. \"Democrats steal everything, then blame job creators for their 'greed,'\" he wrote.\n\nSacks said in an October episode of the \"All-In\" podcast, which he cohosts, that a wealth tax \"always backfires,\" because tax benefits are outweighed by wealthy residents leaving.\n\nSacks threatened to leave the state, analogizing steady tax increases to boiling a frog on the podcast.\n\n\"I'm going to have to jump out of the pot with this,\" he said.\n\nThe Congressman for California's 17th district, which covers much of Silicon Valley, said that the proposal was \"good for American innovation.\"\n\nAfter receiving thousands of comments on a Friday post bidding a sarcastic goodbye to those threatening to leave the state, Khanna explained his support in a seven-paragraph X post on Saturday.\n\nHe wrote that Nvidia would be built all over again, even with the wealth tax.\n\n\"Jensen [Huang] wasn't thinking I won't start this company because I may have to one day pay a 1% tax on my billions,\" Khanna wrote. \"He built here because the talent is here.\"\n\nKhanna argued that innovation would be further stifled by the \"political dysfunction and social unrest\" that comes with wide wealth gaps.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, wrote that the representative has \"always supported a modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have healthcare.\"\n\n\"He has advocated for common sense workarounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock,\" Drory wrote.\n\nThe Oculus founder and Anduril cofounder wrote in a Sunday X post that the tax would force founders to \"sell huge chunks of our companies.\"\n\nLuckey wrote that he made money from Oculus — which he sold to Facebook in 2014 — and paid millions in taxes on it. Then he used the \"remainder\" to start Anduril, he wrote.\n\n\"Now me and my cofounders have to somehow come up with billions of dollars in cash,\" Luckey wrote.\n\nLuckey also wrote that the policy made no provision for companies that funnel revenue back to research and development, rather than paying cash incomes sizable enough to cover the tax.\n\n\"You are effectively forcing companies to immediately pivot into profit obsession over mission or long-term sustainability,\" he wrote.\n\nThe CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in a Saturday X post that the tax would \"kill little tech in California.\"\n\nUnicorn startup founders become a \"paper billionaire\" — as in, having cash on hand — around the $5 billion valuation point, Tan wrote.\n\nThe proposed tax is on unrealized gains, meaning founders would be put on the line even before their wealth is liquid, Tan wrote.\n\nIf the tax passed, Tan wrote that Y Combinator would consider opening Austin or Cambridge programs.\n\nThe Vermont senator has long been a proponent of taxes on the wealthy, introducing a bill in 2019 that aimed to halve the wealth of billionaires over a 15-year period.\n\nWhile Sanders didn't explicitly comment on the California proposal, he posted Monday on X broadly supporting wealth taxes.\n\n\"We can respect innovation & entrepreneurship, but we cannot respect the extraordinary greed that now exists,\" Sanders wrote. \"We need a wealth tax.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO reposted another user's X post that commented on the tax, saying that his stocks weren't wealth.\n\nMusk wrote in his Tuesday post that his \"wealth\" was mostly tied up in Tesla and SpaceX shares.\n\n\"This means my 'wealth' can only increase due to producing more products and services for the public,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile not directly commenting on the California tax, Musk wrote that he was a \"maker,\" unlike \"taker\" politicians like Sanders.\n\nMusk said in 2020 that he had moved from California to Texas.\n\nThe governor of California has spoken against the wealth tax. At The New York Times' Dealbook conference in December, Newsom said that California had to stay competitive with other states.\n\n\"People of that status, they already have two or three homes outside the state,\" he said. \"You've got to be pragmatic about it.\"\n\nIf the tax passes as a ballot measure, Newsom would not have the ability to veto it.",

She was known for her book \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have\" and her work as a science and climate reporter for The New York Times until she left the paper in 2017.\n\nShe said in her essay that she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer after doctors noticed her white blood cell count looked \"strange.\" She was shocked by the diagnosis.\n\n\"I didn't feel sick,\" she wrote. \"I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew. I regularly ran five to ten miles in Central Park. I once swam three miles across the Hudson River—eerily, to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\"\n\nOver the past year and a half, she received various cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, a bone-marrow transplant from her sister, and CAR-T immunotherapy.\n\nIn her November essay, she also spoke out against her cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whom she called an \"embarrassment\" to her family. As health secretary, Kennedy has cut research funding for mRNA vaccines that could be used to fight cancer, and sowed doubt about routine vaccines, which are critically important for cancer patients with weakened immune systems.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, urologist Dr. George Moran, toddler son Edwin, and a 1-year-old daughter.",

    "description": "China's missile arsenal can strike targets around Taiwan, across the Indo-Pacific, and even in the continental US. The maps paint a clear picture.",
    "fullText": "China's missile arsenal is expanding rapidly, and new maps and data from the Pentagon show its size and reach.\n\nChina's missile branch, known as the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, has seen substantial growth in recent years as Beijing builds new platforms for conventional and nuclear strike. Its capabilities threaten US, allied, and partner forces.\n\nThe latest Pentagon report on China's military offers estimates for the number of launchers and missiles in the Chinese arsenal, including the country's intercontinental ballistic missiles, key parts of its nuclear deterrent.\n\nChinese ICBMs include missiles like the DF-5 and DF-41. The Pentagon estimates China has 550 ICBM launchers and 400 missiles with estimated ranges beyond 5,500 km, the threshold for classification as an ICBM.\n\nFor China's medium-range ballistic missiles, such as China's DF-21s or hypersonic DF-17, the Pentagon assesses that China has 300 launchers for 1,300 missiles with ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 km. The report also documented increases in the number of launchers and missiles for some notable systems. China's intermediate-range ballistic missiles, like the DF-26 missile, jumped from 250 launchers in last year's report to 300 this year, and the number of IRBMs total went from 500 to 550.\n\nThese figures illustrate how heavily Beijing has invested in a powerful, diverse missile arsenal. The Pentagon highlighted in its report that the Rocket Force could play an important role in a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or other regional conflict.\n\nAccording to the latest report, China's rocket force \"is prepared to conduct missile attacks against high-value targets, including Taiwan's C2 [command and control] facilities, air bases, and radar sites\" as well as deter or delay the US or its allies and partners from coming to Taiwan's aid.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the Rocket Force has continued to rehearse strikes in recent military exercises, including 2024 drills simulating an invasion or blockade of Taiwan.\n\nOne map in the report shows the estimated reach of Chinese missiles that could be particularly relevant in a fight over Taiwan, weapons such as ship- and shore-launched surface-to-air missiles for knocking out hostile aircraft, as well as anti-ship cruise missiles fired from naval platforms like Chinese destroyers and land-based close- and short-range ballistic missiles.\n\nAnother Pentagon map shows the estimated reach of China's conventional strike missiles, including the DF-17 and DF-21 MRBMs, the DF-26 IRBM, and the newly fielded DF-27 ICBM, which, like the DF-26 and some DF-21s, has an anti-ship role in addition to land attack.\n\nMany of these systems can reach across the first island chain, which includes Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, while longer-range missiles extend toward the second island chain and beyond.\n\nThe DF-26 is concerning for US planners. The weapon, nicknamed the \"Guam Express,\" can be armed with either conventional or nuclear warheads and reach US installations on Guam. It can target US aircraft carriers and other surface ships as well.\n\nBombers, like China's H-6, carrying CJ-20 cruise missiles could threaten parts of Alaska. And then the ICBMs can range significantly further. The DF-27 can, for instance, range parts of the continental United States.\n\nThe Department of Defense report also looks at China's nuclear strike options, such as land-based ICBMs and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.\n\nChina test-launched an ICBM, specifically a DF-31B missile, in September 2024, firing it from a position on Hainan Island into the Pacific. The test was the first beyond the country's borders since the 1980s and allowed China to verify ICBM performance. The Department of Defense suspects weapons tests like these may become more regular.\n\nThis year, at a military parade in Beijing, China unveiled new, previously unseen ICBMs, shocking China watchers. Those weapons, including the new DF-61 and DF-31BJ, are not included in the Pentagon's assessments.\n\nChina also continues to bolster its nuclear warhead count, estimated at over 600 warheads. Although 2024 saw a slower rate of production than previous years, the Pentagon still assesses that the Chinese military is on its way to 1,000 warheads by 2030, only a fraction of the US and Russian stockpiles.\n\nA Pentagon map estimating the ranges of Chinese missiles available for nuclear strike indicates that three — the DF-5, DF-41, and DF-31 — all have the continental US well within range, while the submarine-launched JL-3 missile can hit most of it from waters near China. On a submarine positioned farther out, more targets could be within striking distance.\n\nDespite these continued advancements, questions remain on the differences in quality and capabilities of Chinese weapons and training compared to the US. The Pentagon also believes China is still navigating the impacts of a vast anti-corruption campaign in the military that has particularly targeted PLARF officials.\n\nThe campaign could be detrimental if driven by political agendas, or it could deliver long-term improvements if it addresses actual problems within the force. At this point, it's unclear how the changes will affect it.",

    "fullText": "Marriott International (MAR), one of the world’s largest hotel chains, had a year of notable achievements and a few setbacks. The chain behind brands such as The Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, and JW Marriott operates more than 30 brands and nearly 9,600 properties in 143 countries and territories.\n\nIn 2025, in just one quarter, Marriott added 120 properties and 17,903 rooms, focusing on its asset-light franchising segment, according to analyst Daniel Javier for Seeking Alpha. Luxury offerings remained a priority, with 26 new hotels opening in India and 1,900 rooms added to its portfolio.\n\nHowever, Marriott also faced controversy. In November, the Maasai ethnic group filed a lawsuit to demolish a new Ritz-Carlton luxury safari camp, claiming it blocks a key Serengeti wildlife migration route.\n\nMeanwhile, a Fairfield by Marriott posted a sign stating that complimentary bottled water isn’t included, even for elite members, unless they select a “market item,” drawing mockery online, according to Veronika Bondarenko of TheStreet.\n\nMore recently, Marriott caused guest backlash with a new ban.\n\nThe New Orleans Marriott Warehouse Arts District caught attention from guests due to a sign saying “Benches are for Marriott employees only.”\n\nThe hotel is located in a 19th-century warehouse, close to the French Quarter,  the New Orleans Garden District, and the Central Business District.\n\n“Our New Orleans hotel in the downtown area enjoys an excellent location across the street from the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. Host events from 26,636 square feet of revamped event space and fuel up for the day ahead at our full-service Starbucks,” reads the description on Marriott's hotel page.\n\nThe benches in question are part of the hotel’s common area and are easily accessible by the public, which Marriott appears to prefer the public not use. A sign noting that the benches are for employee-only use is next to “No Smoking” and “No Loitering” plastered on the red brick wall, writes The Travel.\n\nDoes the sign mean that hotel guests, no matter their status, aren’t welcome to use the benches?\n\nWhile the water bottle incident is clear, as the hotel giant plainly states that  complimentary bottled water isn’t included unless guests select a “market item,” the sign designating benches only for employees is somewhat confusing.\n\nView from the Wing’s Gary Leff, a recognized expert in miles, points, and business travel, believes that the New Orleans Marriott sign “employees only” isn’t really about keeping guests out, but instead is meant to prevent loitering, smoking, panhandling, and other security issues near the entrance.\n\n“This sign is almost certainly not about guests. It’s in New Orleans. It’s about loitering control. They’re also flagging NO LOITERING and NO SMOKING. That says, we’ve had people hanging out here who aren’t supposed to be here and we want them gone,” writes Leff for View from the Wing.\n\nWhile the intent was maintaining security and staff space, the sign gives a poor impression of hospitality and might have been handled more tactfully with design changes, such as divided benches or better lighting.\n\nLeff further notes that the sign is not ideal for either guests or staff, as guests feel like they are not welcomed, and staff get a message along the lines that their breakout area is out on the sidewalk, under a \"No Loitering\" sign.\n\nOnline readers also weighed in on Marriott’s approach, providing insight into guest perceptions.\n\nIn the comment section of View from the Wing, one reader expressed frustration with the signage, noting it may not deter loitering effectively. While anecdotal, these reactions illustrate how guests perceive the policy.\n\nUser Mantis wrote, “...Now there’s a sign, oh my…that will surely solve the problem.”\n\nA user with a spontaneous username \"This comes to mind\" suggested a more precise sign: “For employees and currently registered guests only.”\n\nOther guests suggested the hotel could have hired a doorman, while another noted that a sign is less expensive.\n\nOverall, comments suggest that a world-class hotel brand such as Marriott could have managed the situation more subtly with alternative signage or layout changes.\n\nWhile guest reactions to the new policies highlight struggles in hospitality and brand perception, Marriott’s broader business operations in 2025 confirm both resilience and growth. Despite occasional controversies, the hotel giant continues to expand its portfolio, dominate new markets, launch special deals for its loyal members and deliver strong financial results.\n\nGrowth: Marriott added nearly 17,900 rooms in Q3 2025, reached a record pipeline, and returned $3.1 billion to shareholders, as reported in Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nInternational strength: International and higher-end markets continued to outperform the U.S. and Canada in RevPAR, as per Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nResidential expansion: Marriott expanded its branded residential portfolio across EMEA, signing nearly 20 new deals in 2025, according to Marriott’s official press release.\n\nNew brands: Marriott launched Series by Marriott and hit 100 City Express signings in the U.S. and Canada. \n\nAfrica plans: Marriott plans to add 50+ properties and 9,000 rooms in Africa by 2027. \n\nSonder fallout: Marriott ended its licensing deal with Sonder, which later filed for bankruptcy, causing customer and employee disruption, reported TheStreet.\n\nCost & loyalty pressures: Rising loyalty program costs and OTA commissions challenged Marriott, prompting a focus on direct bookings and perks, according to Deep Research Global.\n\nMixed market performance: International markets grew, while U.S. & Canada RevPAR lagged in some quarters, according to Marriott’s Q3 Earnings Report.\n\nAnother lawsuit: In November, Marriott was sued again in relation to land‑use, indigenous and cultural‑heritage disputes tied to hotel developments, reported TheStreet.",

She said that since she has been working, she has been getting paid monthly instead,” according to the police report. “As of now, she said that she still believes she is owed a month’s pay.”\n\n“You will be paying me out for the season & the money you said you would give me,” the victim, who told police she had worked for Diggs since July, wrote in a text to the Patriots receiver.\n\n\"I don’t gotta do a mf thing...You can get whoever you want,\" Diggs responded. \"You got my address, tell them come take the money.”\n\nAfter the alleged assault took place, the victim told police that she received messages from Diggs asking her to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nDiggs made a remote court appearance Tuesday morning with his attorney attempting to have the police report impounded. Attorney Michael DiStefano argued that the details of the charges should remain sealed. DiStefano also reportedly told the court that Diggs offered a financial settlement to resolve the issue with the alleged victim.\n\n“As we speak, they’re working to come to an agreement on that,” DiStefano said.\n\n\"The New England Patriots are aware of the accusations that have been made regarding Stefon Diggs,\" read a statement from the team on Tuesday. \"Stefon has informed the organization that he categorically denies the allegations. We support Stefon. We will continue to gather information and will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities and the NFL as necessary. Out of respect for all parties involved, and given that this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nAnother attorney for Diggs, David Meier, sent a statement to ESPN that said the allegations were \"unsubstantiated.\"\n\n\" Stefon Diggs categorically denies these allegations,\" Meier said. \"They are unsubstantiated, uncorroborated, and were never investigated — because they did not occur. The timing and motivation for making the allegations is crystal clear: they are the direct result of an employee-employer financial dispute that was not resolved to the employee's satisfaction. Stefon looks forward to establishing the truth in a court of law.\"\n\nThe NFL also released a statement that read, \"We are aware of the matter and have been in contact with the club. We have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nThere is a Jan. 23 scheduled arraignment for Diggs. Should the Patriots advance in the NFL playoffs, the AFC championship game is set for Sunday, Jan. 25.\n\nThe judge in the case will reportedly consider a request to extend the arraignment date to March.\n\nThe 32-year-old Diggs is in his 11th NFL season and first with the Patriots after signing a three-year, $69 million to join the team in March. Through 16 games this season he has 82 receptions for 970 yards and four touchdowns.",

    "description": "A veteran of the agency claims he’s faced workplace discrimination due to his sexual orientation.",
    "fullText": "A veteran Washington State Patrol trooper claims he’s faced discrimination and hostility in the agency due to his sexual orientation — issues that reportedly reached a breaking point when WSP personnel created and circulated a demeaning video of him generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nCollin Overend Pearson, who’s a Pierce County resident and gay, alleges that he’s been subjected to “repeated instances of discriminatory and unconstitutional conduct by WSP and its officers” during nearly two decades of employment, according to a lawsuit filed Dec. 19 in Pierce County Superior Court.\n\nThe conduct has damaged his reputation, the complaint said.\n\nIn a statement Monday, WSP spokesperson Chris Loftis declined to comment on the allegations, citing the agency’s policy and practice regarding pending litigation.\n\n“The Washington State Patrol believes that all employees have the right to work in an environment where skills, abilities, and dignity are valued and that is free from bias, harassment, and intimidation,” Loftis said.\n\nPearson is assigned to WSP’s District 1, which covers Pierce and Thurston counties, according to attorney Mark Conrad, who’s representing Pearson.\n\nPrior to suing the state, which allegedly failed to take appropriate actions to curb the discrimination and hostility, Pearson filed a legal claim against it late last year that served as a notice for it to put an end to the bad behavior, Conrad said in an interview Monday.\n\n“Instead of stopping, the conduct escalated,” Conrad said.\n\nIn December, WSP personnel created an AI-generated video that depicted Pearson and another uniformed, male trooper kissing on a roadside, the lawsuit claims. A voiceover in the video states, “this is SWAT training, no homo,” — using a derogatory phrase that insinuates “homosexuality is inferior or insulting,” according to the suit.\n\nConrad said the video was circulated among troopers and appears real, which is what he believes makes it so damaging beyond it being plainly derogatory and intended to humiliate his client. The deepfake also showed that at least some WSP personnel feel emboldened to engage in conduct demeaning to LGBTQ+ employees, he said.\n\nIt was the last straw for Pearson, according to Conrad, who said his client had put much thought into a “very difficult” decision to sue. The lawsuit accuses the state, by and through the WSP, of discrimination, retaliation and invasion of privacy, and it seeks unspecified damages to be proven at trial as well as legal fees.\n\nDespite the personal nature of the claims within the complaint, it was important to Pearson that he step forward, including by using his full name and not just his initials in the public filing, “to ensure that other people don’t have to face the environment that he’s currently facing,” Conrad said.\n\n“This can’t be tolerated in the workplace,” he said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites other alleged instances of discrimination, including when Pearson’s job offer in Des Moines was rescinded after a WSP captain advised the chief of that police department against hiring him, and when WSP detectives investigated an anonymous complaint that accused Pearson of threatening patrons while working off-duty at a Tacoma gay bar.\n\nPearson never worked at the bar, according to Conrad, and the suit said the complainant’s claim against Pearson was deemed to be unfounded. Conrad said he didn’t know the reason why the WSP captain had interfered in Pearson’s career move, nor did he know the status of an internal complaint that Pearson had filed in response.\n\nIn one instance, when Pearson inadvertently missed work, the WSP reacted more strongly than it did in similar situations involving other troopers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPearson had been out sick for two days in December 2023 and overslept for a shift after his phone died. He didn’t notify his supervisor that he would miss work. A trooper was dispatched to Pearson’s home, where a man who was staying with Pearson answered the door and Pearson was awoken and interrogated by the trooper, according to the suit. Later that day, WSP personnel sent Ruston Police Department officers to conduct an additional check at the home, the suit said.\n\nThe missed workday prompted a formal months-long WSP investigation that involved outside agencies and included interviews with Pearson’s colleagues and scrutiny of his personal life, according to the suit. Ultimately, it was recommended Pearson be suspended for five days without pay for violations of “neglect of duty” and “use of alcohol — off duty,” the suit said.\n\nDuring a hearing on the matter, Washington State Patrol Troopers Association president Spike Unruh objected to the latter violation, arguing that WSP had unlawfully entered Pearson’s home without his consent, according to the suit.\n\n“Unruh also presented evidence that numerous troopers had previously overslept and were not subjected to home entry or similar treatment, and that it was not standard practice to involve outside agencies or conduct multiple home visits when a trooper failed to show for one workday,” the suit said.\n\nThe WSP’s probe “had effectively ‘outed’ Plaintiff’s sexuality to the entire (Office of Professional Standards) section, further compounding the emotional toll of the situation,” the suit said.\n\nIn August 2024, the WSP acknowledged that the entry into Pearson’s home was illegal and that no information obtained during that entry could be used against him, according to the suit, which said that the agency reclassified the off-duty alcohol violation as “undetermined.”",

    "title": "Why You Should Give Yourself ‘Crappy’ Rewards for Your Fitness Goals",
    "description": "Paradoxically, weak rewards build strong motivation.",
    "fullText": "Rewarding yourself can backfire. If you tell yourself, “I’ll only listen to my favorite podcast while I’m at the gym,” it takes just one moment of weakness to realize you can cheat and listen to it any time you want. Instead, try this: Reward yourself with something that has no enjoyment value whatsoever. Like a checkmark on your calendar.\n\nI first heard this tip from writer Tim Clare’s podcast. If you want to stay motivated, he says, the reward has to be so crappy that you’re not actually working for the reward. He said that he puts a checkmark on his calendar every day he writes, and at the end of the week enough checkmarks earn a gold star. The same approach has worked for me and for others. I have to admit: Buying myself a pack of stickers is embarrassingly motivating.\n\nTim Clare likes the theory that this works because of cognitive dissonance: We have to change something major (our behavior) to earn something that's not valuable (a sticker), so we try to resolve that dissonance by deciding we value the behavior change. The crappy extrinsic reward strengthens our sense that the new habit is intrinsically valuable.\n\nAnd as my colleague Meredith Dietz has written, experts believe that the secret to lasting motivation lies in our intrinsic goals. Engaging in healthy behaviors like exercise only works if we're doing those behaviors for their own sake, not because we're enduring our gym time as a means to an end. Extrinsic rewards like streaks and badges can gamify this process so addictively that we lose sight of why we're actually doing it in the first place. Note that I'm not saying you should chase streaks; I'm thinking more like literal stickers on a piece of paper, or a note in your phone where you write down how many miles you ran this week.\n\nAnother type of ineffective reward is the real-life splurge: promising you'll treat yourself to something (a dessert, a clothing purchase) once you hit a certain goal. Here's the problem: If you hate exercising so much that you need a bribe to do it at all, you're quickly going to find a way to have the reward without the work. There's nothing actually stopping you from listening to that \"gym only\" podcast at home, or ordering yourself the new outfit you had earmarked as a reward for when you make it through the couch to 5K program.\n\nUsing a crappy reward works because it just reflects your existing motivation back on itself. You check off today's work, not because the checkmark is valuable in itself, but because the checkmark reminds you that you kept a promise to yourself. There's a thrill to closing that loop, and those little wins really build your self-efficacy. In self-efficacy theory, small wins boost your motivation to keep working toward bigger goals.\n\nThe best part of using stickers or checkmarks is that it’s pointless to cheat. What are you going to do—lie to yourself when you didn’t actually go to the gym? But building up that row of numbers or stickers becomes its own reward. You’re really just rewarding yourself with the satisfaction of having stuck to your habit.",

    "title": "Seven Clever Ways to Use C-Clamps Around the House",
    "description": "If you have one of these classic metal clamps, you should know they’re way more useful than you think.",
    "fullText": "If you’ve been doing any kind of work around any kind of house for a while, you probably have a few trusty old-school C-Clamps on hand. The C-Clamp has been in use for thousands of years. It’s one of those dead-simple tools that just works. It’s also one of those tools you tend to collect multiple examples of, in different sizes.\n\nTypically, you use a C-Clamp to, uh, clamp stuff together, like two pieces of wood, or to clamp something into place while you work on it (I use them a lot to cut lumber so I can have both hands on the saw, as I am allergic to emergency rooms.) But the C-Clamp is actually a very versatile tool that can be deployed in a number of creative—but useful!—ways. Here are some of my favorite ways to repurpose those old C-Clamps.\n\nIf you need to carry something that’s bulky, heavy, and awkward, having some temporary handles always makes the job easier. If you have a few C-Clamps, you’re golden: Just clamp a couple onto whatever you’re transporting and you have instant handles to make the haul a little easier. They can also be used as handles for rolled-up materials, like rugs or mats—just thread the roll through a pair of C-Clamps, tighten them closed, and carry on.\n\nIt’s happened to all of us: You need to drive a nail somewhere, but there’s no room to swing a hammer, or for some reason you’re reluctant to make a lot of banging noise. The solution is your trusty C-Clamp: Just place the clamp over the nail head and tighten. The clamping action will inexorably (and silently) drive that nail into place. This isn’t an efficient way to drive a lot of nails, of course, but in a tight spot, it’s brilliant.\n\nNeed to tighten or loosen a connector, but you don’t have a wrench at hand? Tighten a C-Lamp around the bolt, cuff, or connection point so that it’s gripping tightly, then slowly turn it in the direction you need. Make sure the clamp is tight enough to prevent slippage, and you might want to use something (a handy piece of cloth works) to protect the connection from damage as you work.\n\nWhether it’s corralling all those extension and power cords on a workbench or work site, or organizing computer cables on your desk with an industrial vibe, C-Clamps can keep all those wires under control and out of your way in a pinch. Just gather the cords at the edge of the desk or table and clamp them down. This is a perfect temporary solution, as the cords can pass freely through the clamps without risk of damage, and the clamps can be removed when the job is done.\n\nNeed a couple of bookends to hold stuff in place on a shelf? A pair of C-Clamps attached to the outer edge and clamped in as deep as possible will work. This could even be a permanent design choice if your taste runs toward the rustic or industrial.\n\nC-Clamps are ideal devices when anchor points are needed, but you don’t want to attach anything permanent that would require fasteners and drilling into a structure. Need a clothesline to dry your laundry when the dryer breaks? Two C-Clamps and some rope or twine are all you need. Need to hang tools, clothes, or anything else? C-Clamps attached to a shelf of any kind, combined with a hook, will work a charm. Need to hold a tablecloth or other covering in place? Nothing clamps stuff down to a horizontal surface better than C-Clamps.\n\nWhether you’re spooling filament to your 3D-printer or feeding twine or wire to yourself as you work on a project, sliding the spool over a C-Clamp and then clamping it into place gives you a sturdy holder that you can pull from. This means you won’t have to juggle your spool every time you need more slack, and you can easily unclamp and reposition the spool if you’re on the move as you work.",

    "fullText": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The United States and Ivory Coast signed a health deal Tuesday requiring the U.S. to commit $480 million to the West African nation’s health sector as part of “America First” global health funding pacts that mirror the Trump administration’s foreign policy.\n\nThe signing in Ivory Coast’s capital of Abidjan covers areas such as HIV, malaria, maternal and child health, and global health security. It is the latest agreement the U.S. has entered with more than a dozen African countries, most of them hit by U.S. aid cuts, including Ivory Coast.\n\nU.S. aid cuts have crippled health systems across the developing world, including in Africa, where many countries relied on the funding for crucial programs, including those responding to outbreaks of disease.\n\nThe new health pact is based on the principle of shared responsibility with Ivory Coast committing to provide up to 163 billion CFA francs ($292 million) by 2030, representing 60% of the overall commitment, according to Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ivory Coast Jessica Davis Ba said the U.S. government is moving “beyond the traditional aid approach toward a model focused on trade, innovation, and shared prosperity.”\n\n“Today, our bilateral cooperation is entering a new phase. We are implementing the America First global health strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the new “America First” global health funding agreements are meant to increase self-sufficiency and eliminate what it says are ideology and waste from international assistance. The deals replace a patchwork of previous health agreements under the now-dismantled United States Agency for International Development.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, USAID had invested $115 million to support sectors such as health, education and aid for refugees mostly fleeing violence in neighboring Sahel states.\n\nAnalysts say the new approach to global health aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad.",

If you are hoping that $2.5 million will provide you with $100K, you should consider both whether that income is possible at a safe withdrawal rate and how your tax bill is going to affect the amount ... Is $2.5M Enough To Spend $100K A Year In Retirement, Or Will Taxes Make That Impossible?",
    "fullText": "A Reddit user is wondering if a $2.5 million nest egg can produce $100K in income.\n\nHe’s concerned about taxes but also needs to pay attention to his withdrawal rate.\n\nIf he wants to avoid worrying about taxes as a retiree, he can save in Roth accounts.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nWhen you are making plans for retirement spending, you need to take many costs into account -- including taxes. If you are hoping that $2.5 million will provide you with $100K, you should consider both whether that income is possible at a safe withdrawal rate and how your tax bill is going to affect the amount you have left over to spend.\n\nBefore you even consider the impact of taxes, you need to make a decision on a safe withdrawal rate.\n\nExperts traditionally recommended that you follow the 4% rule if you wanted the best chance of your money lasting for at least 30 years. Since that rule says you can withdraw 4% of your account balance in your first year of retirement and then make inflation-based adjustments, your $2.5 million could produce exactly $100,000.\n\nHowever, experts have now revised that downward to say you should limit withdrawals to 3.7%. There have also long been questions as to whether the 4% rule is conservative enough, especially as projections for future returns have gotten lower and projected future lifespans have gotten longer.\n\nIf you don't mind taking a greater chance of your money running short, you could still stick with the 4.00% rule and assume you'll be able to withdraw $100K from your $2.5 million account without problems. But, if you don't like the idea of cutting things so close, you may be better off aiming to save a little more to give you a cushion -- even before you consider the issue of how taxes will impact your ability to spend $100K.\n\nNow, you have another issue to deal with: Taxes. Let's say you do decide you're OK with taking $100K per year out of your accounts. The question becomes, how much of that money will you have to give to the IRS and to your state or local government? If you were hoping to have $100K after taxes to spend, will that be possible?\n\nThe answer to that is: It depends. If you have put all of your money into a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) account, then you don't have to worry about taxes as long as you follow the rules for tax-free withdrawals. If you take $100K out, you can spend it all.  If you want to take the simplest approach and not have to think about the impact of taxes on your investments, this is most likely the route you should go.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City are close to agreeing terms with Bournemouth to sign Antoine Semenyo for £65m - but Andoni Iraola insists the forward has \"definitely not\" played his last game for the Cherries.\n\nCity's move for the Ghana forward, 25, is at an advanced stage with talks over the past 48 hours aimed at closing the finer details of the deal.\n\nThey have agreed to meet Semenyo's £65m release clause, while the player's representatives were in Manchester on Monday finalising personal terms.\n\nDiscussions continued on Tuesday, with sources indicating a total agreement is now close with the January transfer window due to open on Thursday.\n\nSemenyo, who played the full 90 minutes of the 2-2 draw with Chelsea on Tuesday, has been keen for his future to be resolved by 1 January.\n\nHowever, Iraola is adamant the attacker will play against Arsenal on Saturday, 3 January.\n\n\"He is a massive player for us and he will still be with us,\" the Bournemouth boss told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"It is not the last game he has played for us, definitely not.\"\n\nSources have told BBC Sport Bournemouth want him to play against the Gunners and then Tottenham on Wednesday, 7 January before the release mechanism in his deal elapses on 10 January.\n\nAs reported by BBC Sport on Sunday, Liverpool retain an interest in Semenyo but, unless the Premier League champions launch a late bid, he is heading to City.\n\nDespite interest from five clubs, including Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham, City remain the only one to have made formal contact with Bournemouth.",

    "fullText": "on December 30, 2025 at 12:00PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nNew Year’s Eve doesn’t have to be limited to champagne and confetti in the real world. Video games offer their own ways to celebrate, from dazzling fireworks to high-speed races and creative parties with friends. Sometimes, getting together virtually is the only way everyone can be together.\n\nIn Animal Crossing, you can ring in the new year with a sky full of fireworks over your island. Fortnite Creative lets you throw your own custom parties with friends, complete with music, games, and chaos. Mario Kart brings the celebration to the tracks, where fireworks light up the sky as you race across Rainbow Road as the clock towards the new year ticks down.\n\nNo matter your style, these games turn the countdown into an interactive, unforgettable experience that's perfect for friends and families who can't be together to ring in the new year.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is one of the few games that fully commits to New Year’s Eve as an in-game event. On December 31, the plaza transforms with decorations, party favors, sparklers, and a real-time countdown that syncs with the player’s system clock. Isabelle and villagers gather in the square, music ramps up as midnight approaches, and fireworks cap off the celebration.\n\nBecause islands are persistent social spaces, players can invite friends over to experience the countdown together. Everyone can dress for the occasion, emote, exchange gifts, and wander the island after midnight. It feels less like a mini game and more like a shared holiday ritual, which is why it remains the gold standard for virtual New Year’s parties.\n\nWe have Mario Kart World listed here, but nearly any Mario Kart game will work. The series is known for gorgeous tracks that feature stunning visual effects, many of which are fireworks that would fit in on any New Year's Eve parade or celebration.\n\nHop online, hit up a few tracks, and if you're up for it--setup a race along one of those courses that feature fireworks just as the countdown triggers. We're talking Crown City or several iterations of Rainbow Road, among others.\n\nMario Kart World does offer custom lobbies that make it easy to connect with friends, but you can also tout Mario Kart out as part of any in-person New Year's Eve party too!\n\nWhile Epic Games has been known to feature fireworks in live battle royale lobbies near the end of the year, the real party kicks off in Fortnite Creative. Here you can find player-made game modes that let you play your own way--including custom trivia night mods, prop hunt, and party royale-like modes.\n\nOf course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with hopping from the battle bus together as the remaining hours in the year grow fewer and fewer. WinterFest takes place in Fortnite around the end of December each year, giving the island a snowy backdrop as you fight for your life.\n\nWarzone doesn't have the flexibility of something like Fortnite Creative, but its high-octane action makes for some scenes that feel like a New Year's Eve fireworks show. Blowing up helicopters out of the sky or sending trucks off the ground with explosives are little milestones on the way to battle royale victory.\n\nWarzone has become more popular than traditional Call of Duty--and for good reason. Battle royale brings the survival element of war that no other Call of Duty has before. Doing so, with friends, at the end of the year is a blast.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV excels at player-driven celebrations. Housing districts, Free Company estates, and public hubs often host New Year’s countdowns organized by the community. Players dress up, set off fireworks, and gather around stages while DJs stream music externally.\n\nThe game’s strength is how social it feels even without official events. Emotes, glamour, and roleplay-friendly systems allow players to turn the night into a true virtual party. It feels communal, intentional, and uniquely festive.\n\nGTA Online offers endless locations for hosting a New Year’s party, from penthouses and yachts to nightclubs and rooftops. Fireworks launchers, champagne animations, and curated music help sell the celebration without much effort.\n\nPrivate sessions make it easy to turn chaos into a controlled party environment. Friends can dress up, take screenshots, and roam Los Santos together at midnight, blending sandbox freedom with a party atmosphere.\n\nMinecraft is a blank canvas for New Year’s parties. Players can build stages, countdown clocks, and massive firework rigs, then invite friends to explore and celebrate together. Redstone allows for surprisingly elaborate countdown mechanics.\n\nBecause it is player-driven, each party feels personal. Whether it is a cozy survival world or a creative server spectacle, Minecraft lets groups define what celebration looks like.\n\nRoblox thrives on social experiences, many of which are designed specifically for events. Player-creators and professionals regularly create countdown rooms, concert spaces, and dance clubs perfect for New Year’s Eve gatherings.\n\nIts accessibility makes it easy to invite large groups, even casual players. Jumping between games keeps the party moving, while social hubs provide a place to gather at midnight.\n\nFall Guys feels like a party game by design, with colorful characters and short, high-energy rounds. Friends can queue together and treat matches as playful chaos while chatting through the countdown. The lack of downtime makes it ideal for New Year’s Eve. It keeps energy high without demanding focus, letting players celebrate and laugh together.\n\nSome minigames offer the perfect backdrop for a New Year's Eve gathering, including Short Circuit and Hex-A-Terrestrial, complete with a night sky and bright lights to get you in the festive mood.\n\nNo Man’s Sky offers a surprisingly calm party atmosphere. The Nexus serves as a shared social hub, while player-built bases can become private celebration spaces complete with fireworks and emotes. The game works well for laid-back New Year’s parties. Players can explore, take group photos, and ring in the new year against alien skies.\n\nSea of Thieves turns New Year’s Eve into a pirate celebration. Crews can sail together, play shanties, drink grog, and fire cannons into the sky at midnight. The trick shots people have been able to pull off by launching themselves out of cannons, across the sea, and onto other ships are nothing short of incredible. Drunken-madness induced incredible, though.\n\nSea of Thieves adventures are less about competition or loot and more about the shared memorable moments created. Even just sailing under the stars can make for a wonderful way to ring in the new year.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic leans into rowdy celebration through its Space Rig hub. Players can dance, drink at the bar, and trigger music before or after missions, making it a natural gathering spot. Honestly, the Overwatch-like mining adventure is a blast, but sometimes you don't even need to jump into the action to have a good time.\n\nA New Year’s party here feels communal and silly. It is perfect for smaller groups that want something social without leaving co-op gameplay behind.",

    "description": "Israel on Tuesday said it had suspended more than two dozen humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and CARE, from operating in the Gaza Strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.  Israel says the rules are aimed at preventing Hamas and other militant groups from infiltrating the aid organizations.",
    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel on Tuesday said it had suspended more than two dozen humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and CARE, from operating in the Gaza Strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.\n\nIsrael says the rules are aimed at preventing Hamas and other militant groups from infiltrating the aid organizations. But the organizations say the rules are arbitrary and warned that the new ban would harm a civilian population desperately in need of humanitarian aid.\n\nIsrael has claimed throughout the war that Hamas was siphoning off aid supplies, a charge the U.N. and aid groups have denied. The new rules, announced by Israel early this year, require aid organizations to register the names of their workers and provide details about funding and operations in order to continue working in Gaza.\n\nThe new regulations included ideological requirements — including disqualifying organizations that have called for boycotts against Israel, denied the Oct. 7 attack or expressed support for any of the international court cases against Israeli soldiers or leaders.\n\nIsrael’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs said more than 30 groups — about 15% of the organizations operating in Gaza — had failed to comply and that their operations would be suspended. It also said that Doctors Without Borders, one of the biggest and best-known groups in Gaza, had failed to respond to Israeli claims that some of its workers were affiliated with Hamas or Islamic Jihad.\n\n“The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome — the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not,” Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli said.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said Israel's decision would have a catastrophic impact on their work in Gaza, where they support around 20% of the hospital beds and a third of births. The organization also denied Israel's accusations about their staff.\n\n“MSF would never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity,” it said.\n\nWhile Israel claimed the decision would have limited impact on the ground. the affected organizations said the timing — less than three months into a fragile ceasefire — was devastating.\n\n“Despite the ceasefire, the needs in Gaza are enormous and yet we and dozens of other organizations are and will continue to be blocked from bringing in essential life-saving assistance,” said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which has also been suspended.\n\n“Not being able to send staff into Gaza means all of the workload falls on our exhausted local staff,” Low said.\n\nSome aid groups say they didn’t submit the list of Palestinian staff, as Israel demanded, for fear they’d be targeted by Israel, and because of data protection laws in Europe.\n\n“It comes from a legal and safety perspective. In Gaza, we saw hundreds of aid workers get killed,” Low explained.\n\nThe decision not to renew aid groups’ licenses means offices in Israel and East Jerusalem will close, and organizations won’t be able to send international staff or aid into Gaza.\n\nIsrael says militants exploiting aid groups\n\nAccording to the ministry, the decision means the aid groups will have their license revoked on Jan. 1, and if they are located in Israel, they will need to leave by March 1. They can appeal the decision.\n\nThe Israeli defense body that oversees humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said that the organizations on the list contribute less than 1% of the total aid going into the Gaza Strip, and that aid will continue to enter from more than 20 organizations that did receive permits to continue operating.\n\n“The registration process is intended to prevent the exploitation of aid by Hamas, which in the past operated under the cover of certain international aid organizations, knowingly or unknowingly,” COGAT said in a statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time Israel has tried to crack down on international humanitarian organizations. Throughout the war, Israel accused the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, of being infiltrated by Hamas, using its facilities and taking aid. The United Nations has denied it. UNRWA, the top U.N. agency working with Palestinians, has denied knowingly aiding armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants..\n\nAfter months of criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies, Israel banned UNRWA from operating on its territory in January. The U.S., formerly the largest donor to UNRWA, halted funding to the agency in early 2024.\n\nNGOs say Israel vague over data use\n\nIsrael failed to confirm that the data collected from the new regulations wouldn't be used for military or intelligence purposes, raising serious security concerns, said Athena Rayburn, the executive director of AIDA, an umbrella organization representing over 100 organizations that operate in the Palestinian territories. She noted that more than 500 aid workers have been killed in Gaza during the war.\n\n“Agreeing for a party to the conflict to vet our staff, especially under the conditions of occupation, is a violation of humanitarian principles, specifically neutrality and independence,” she said.\n\nRayburn said organizations expressed their concerns and offered alternatives to submitting staff lists, such as third-party vetting, but that Israel refused to engage in any dialogue.\n\nPalestinian girl killed in Gaza\n\nA 10-year-old girl was killed and another person was wounded by Israeli fire in Gaza City near the Yellow Line that delineates areas under Israeli control, the territory's Shifa Hospital said Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident but have said troops operating near the Yellow Line will target anyone who approaches or threatens soldiers.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, said on Monday that 71,266 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, not including the girl. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. The United Nations and independent experts consider the Health Ministry the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.\n\nFind more of AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.",

    "fullText": "There are a variety of ways to invest in the chip boom.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is a leading global chip designer.\n\nASML plays an integral role in the advancement of chip technology.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Advanced Micro Devices ›\n\nThe chip sector has performed exceptionally well in recent years, and that growth continues to be fueled by massive spending on AI infrastructure, which makes chips a fundamental commodity of the digital era. Chips are essential for everything from data centers and AI accelerators to electric vehicles, industrial equipment, and consumer electronics.\n\nCompanies leading in advanced chip manufacturing and AI-specific hardware design are securing wide moats against their competitors. While this sector can be volatile, strong demand provides a solid underlying tailwind and investors with the risk tolerance to put cash into this space could benefit from robust returns over the long run.\n\nOn that note, here are two fantastic chip stocks to buy and hold for at least the next decade.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is a semiconductor company that designs and develops computer processors and graphics technologies. AMD is a fabless semiconductor company, which means it designs its chips internally but outsources physical manufacturing to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nIts major product lines include central processing units (CPUs) under the Ryzen brand for consumer personal computers and the brand EPYC for enterprise servers, where it has consistently gained market share from key competitors including the likes of Intel. AMD sells graphics processing units (GPUs) under its Radeon line for gaming and professional visualization purposes.\n\nFor example, AMD provides custom hardware for major gaming consoles including the Sony PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X/S. Its GPUs are also becoming increasingly important for data center growth.\n\nAMD expects its data center business to grow at a greater than 60% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next few years. Thanks to its 2022 acquisition of Xilinx, AMD is also now a leader in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs enable highly optimized hardware designs for specific AI algorithms and their reconfigurable hardware offers unique flexibility, low latency, and power efficiency.\n\nIn terms of AMD's financial growth, the company reported total revenue of about $26 billion in fiscal year 2024. Of that total, about $13 billion (49% of total revenue) was attributable its data center business. Those top line figures represented respective increases of 14% and 94% from the prior year. The company's full-year 2024 GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income was approximately $1.64 billion, a 92% increase from 2023.",

    "fullText": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) — At least 41 young men have died as a result of circumcision procedures as part of traditional initiation activities in South Africa in November and December, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nTraditional initiation is a rite of passage into manhood for young men that is practiced annually by various ethic groups in Africa, including parts of South Africa. Among them are the Xhosa, Ndebele, Sotho and Venda communities.\n\nTraditionally, young men are isolated at initiation schools where they are taught cultural values and responsibilities as they become adults. The circumcision part of the initiation results every year in the deaths of some initiates, forcing the government to intervene through legislation.\n\nThe laws force initiation schools to be registered with authorities, but this has not stopped the proliferation of illegal initiation schools where many of the deaths are reported.\n\nParents are expected to pay for their children to be accepted into the initiation school for the prescribed period, which for some is a financial motivation to start an unregistered initiation school.\n\nInitiation periods typically run during winter (June-July) and summer (November-December) school holidays.\n\nSouth Africa's Traditional Affairs Minister Velenkosini Hlabisa told local broadcasters Tuesday that 41 initiates died during this year's summer initiation. He blamed negligence on the part of both the initiation schools, including registered ones, and parents for not adhering to safety standards and medical advice.\n\nHlabisa said some of the unproven advice often given to the young men is to avoid drinking water in order to heal faster.\n\n“There is negligence in terms of meeting health standards in some of the initiation schools. If you take your child to an initiation school, you never make a follow-up, you do not monitor, you do not go there to see whether the child does drink water, you are placing your child at risk,” he said.\n\nEastern Cape province has been identified as a hot spot for the death of initiates, totaling 21 so far.\n\nHlabisa said 41 people have been arrested in relation to illegal initiation schools, including parents who had supplied wrong ages for their children to be admitted.\n\nOnly children who are 16 years and above may be admitted to initiation school with parental consent, according to South African law.\n\nTraditional initiation is widely practiced in African communities, with the return of the initiates often characterized by joyful, cultural celebrations.",

    "fullText": "(NEXSTAR) – Hospitals, nursing homes and other medical facilities are struggling to gain ground on a drug-resistant and deadly fungus that has infected at least 7,000 people in 2025, according to tracking by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCandida auris, a fungus that was first reported in the U.S. in 2016, has spread rapidly over the past several years. It can survive on surfaces for long periods of time before spreading to patients through catheters, breathing tubes or IVs.\n\nSome strains of the fungus are considered a superbug because they’re resistant to all types of antibiotics usually used to treat fungal infections. While healthy people may be able to fight off the infection on their own, the fungus can be deadly in the health care settings where it spreads, where people are often sick and vulnerable.\n\nFungus labeled ‘urgent threat’ by CDC is spreading rapidly, hospital study finds\n\n“If you get infected with this pathogen that’s resistant to any treatment, there’s no treatment we can give you to help combat it. You’re all on your own,” Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of South Carolina, told Nexstar.\n\nThe fungus’ drug resistance has made it especially hard to contain. More than half of states reported clinical cases of Candida auris in 2025, the CDC reported. With one week of data left in the year, the annual case count is approaching last year’s record-breaking figure of more than 7,500 cases.\n\nSee which states are reporting the most cases of Candida auris in the map below. Data was missing for two states: Alabama and Florida.\n\nSome scientists theorize climate change is contributing to the spread of Candida auris and pathogens like it.\n\nHistorically, fungi have had a hard time surviving at our bodies’ warm body temperature, microbiologist Arturo Casadevall, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, told the Associated Press. But as the climate warms, the fungi are adapting.\n\n“We have tremendous protection against environmental fungi because of our temperature. However, if the world is getting warmer and the fungi begin to adapt to higher temperatures as well, some … are going to reach what I call the temperature barrier,” where they’ll be able to survive in the human body, Casadevall said.\n\nCandida auris: Study reveals who is most vulnerable to deadly fungus infection\n\nIn the past, the CDC estimated that “based on information from a limited number of patients, 30–60% of people with C. auris infections have died. However, many of these people had other serious illnesses that also increased their risk of death.”\n\nA study published in July, which looked at patients with Candida auris primarily in Nevada and Florida, found more than half of patients required admission to the intensive care unit and more than one-third needed mechanical ventilation. More than half of patients, whose average age was between 60 and 64, also needed a blood transfusion.",
