    "fullText": "The NFL offseason has many players taking time away from the field to address lingering injuries, decisions, and their playing future. The Kansas City Chiefs missed the playoffs in 2025 but are still a topic of conversation off the field, especially starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nDuring a recent episode of 'Hot Ones Versus,' Grammy-winning artist Ciara and Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson faced off with questions and wing challenges. The rules are simple: tell the truth, or suffer the wrath of the 'Last Dab'. Whoever eats the most wings loses, and Wilson answered a tough question regarding four quarterbacks, including himself.\n\nWilson ranked Mahomes second to Tom Brady, with himself third, ahead of Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning. The former Seattle Seahawks quarterback defeated Manning's Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII. He notably chose a spicy wing rather than answering his wife's question about the worst coach he's played for in his career.\n\nThe 37-year-old's 2025 season came to an end early with the New York Giants as he was benched after the Chiefs defeated him in Week 3. Wilson lost his starting job to rookie Jaxson Dart and, for the rest of the year, served primarily as a veteran mentor. In three games started (six played), he tossed three touchdowns and three interceptions for 831 yards.\n\nWilson has been rumored recently to be a potential backup option for the Chiefs in free agency.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Russell Wilson ranks Patrick Mahomes amongst other great quarterbacks",

    "fullText": "A marginal VAR offside decision caused a fair amount of controversy for Newcastle in midweek. Joe Willock had a goal disallowed at Tottenham when the semi-automated technology said his forehead was offside.\n\nAbraham's goal was the kind of decision the video review was brought in for - the real howlers.\n\nThe Villa striker was clearly ahead of the defence when Douglas Luiz played the free-kick. With VAR, the goal would have been ruled out.\n\nIt would be easy to blame switching between systems as a defence for the assistant, Nick Greenhalgh. But with or without VAR, he would be expected to raise his flag if he's identified an offside.\n\nShould Digne have been sent off?\n\nWould the VAR have stepped in to show a red card to Digne for serious foul play with his late challenge on Jacob Murphy? It is far from certain from what we have seen in the Premier League.\n\nWe often hear the VAR has referenced glancing contact to uphold the decison of a yellow card. See Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby last month.\n\nDigne did come in at some speed and that would have increased the chance of being sent off on review.\n\nYet the Frenchman did not push through on to the shin of the Newcastle player. That his foot came off quickly probably would have saved him.\n\nIt may well have been one of those where the on-field decision would have stood, whether it was yellow or red card.\n\nSerious foul play or denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity (Dogso)?\n\nReally, this incident could have been either. After all, Bizot brought down Murphy with a knee-high challenge - although it was not with studs leading.\n\nWhen the Dutch goalkeeper fouled the Newcastle forward, the Magpies were left with three attackers up against only Luiz, although Dogso could only be applied to the player fouled.\n\nThe VAR would have taken into account the general run of the ball was not towards goal. They would also consider if Luiz would have been able to get across to prevent the shot.\n\nYou can make a case for a degree of doubt for Dogso. But much like the Digne decision it is one which would likely have stayed with the on-field decision.\n\nRead more analysis on the officiating in Aston Villa v Newcastle here",

    "description": "Salah scored and assisted in Saturday’s 3-0 FA Cup win over Brighton and has a further season on his contract, with Van Dijk hoping he remains at Anfield",
    "fullText": "Virgil van Dijk said he “always” wants Mohamed Salah to stay at Liverpool amid questions if the winger will be at Anfield next season.\n\nSalah brought his future on Merseyside into doubt in December with an explosive interview when he accused the club of throwing him under the bus and breaking promises to him.\n\nBut while he was then omitted from the squad for the Champions League game at Inter Milan, relations were repaired to the extent that he has started all seven games since his return from the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nHe scored and assisted in Saturday’s 3-0 FA Cup win over Brighton and has a further season on his contract, with Van Dijk hoping he remains at Anfield.\n\nHe explained: “I always want Mo to stay because I'm a good friend of him and we've been through the highs and not-so-highs – I don't want to call them lows - together for so many years. The same as me, he's got one more year [on his current deal], so we will see.\n\n“I think Mo is still so important for us. Last week he had an assist again and broke another record and he is still the leader and important for me personally, as a captain, to have around and to have him on the pitch and his presence benefits the team. He also has to just keep going.”\n\nSalah’s goal against Brighton was just his second in his last 13 appearances for Liverpool but Van Dijk added: “He always gives the team more than goals. There's obviously a lot of focus on his goals at the moment and that's also part of his life because he puts the standards so extremely high when he doesn't score as much he gets criticised. He has to stay calm and try to be important with everything he still can do and there is so much still he is important for us on and off the pitch.\n\n“Let's see for the rest of the season how important he still is and can be and the rest of the team will hopefully be successful but there is still a long way to go.”",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior made the bold call to hand Mamadou Sarr a start against Hull City, and it paid off as the young defender played a key role in Chelsea’s 4-0 win on Friday night.\n\nThe Senegalese prospect may still be a mystery to many Chelsea supporters, but not to Rosenior. The two already know each other well from Sarr’s loan spell under the Englishman at Strasbourg earlier in the season.\n\nIt has been quite the year for the 20-year-old. He joined Chelsea permanently last summer, took part in the Club World Cup, went back on loan to Strasbourg, won the African Cup of Nations with Senegal, and then returned to Stamford Bridge.\n\nFriday marked just his second appearance for Chelsea. His debut came as a late substitute in the Club World Cup against ES Tunis, but this was his first time in the starting XI – and he certainly grabbed attention.\n\nDespite the game being against Championship opposition, Sarr’s passing numbers stood out. He completed 101 of his 103 passes, which is the most by any Chelsea centre-back this season.\n\nIt was also Rosenior’s third clean sheet in his 11th match in charge. Alan Shearer noted Sarr’s strong showing, and the win placed him among a rare group of players.\n\nOver the past two decades, just four Chelsea players have debuted with a win by four goals or more. The Senegalese defender now joins that list alongside Gonzalo Higuain, Alvaro Morata and Deco.\n\nBack in 1997, Gianluca Vialli made his first start for Chelsea in a similarly dominant fashion, helping his side to a 6-0 win over Barnsley at Stamford Bridge.\n\nDeco’s first start came 11 years after Vialli’s debut, which was a 4-0 win over Portsmouth. The current Barcelona sporting director also hit the net with a stunning goal from distance.\n\nNine years later, Alvaro Morata added his name to the list by scoring a hat-trick in a 4-0 win against Stoke City after his move from Real Madrid.\n\nGonzalo Higuain followed soon after, finding the net twice in a 5-0 victory over Huddersfield Town. Now Sarr has joined that group, and it’s hard to imagine him making a better impression on his full debut.\n\nThe wild stat that puts Liam Rosenior ahead of any other Chelsea manager, including Carlo Ancelotti\n\nKendry Paez’s first River Plate outing sparks unified reaction among fans",

    "fullText": "Devon Witherspoon made himself into a household name during Super Bowl 60, but his journey there was heavily influenced by one of Notre Dame’s newest coaches.\n\nWhen stepping foot in Champaign, IL, Devon Witherspoon was a zero-star according to 247Sports, a scrawny recruit who barely weighed in at 155-pounds. However, then Illinois defensive backs coach Aaron Henry immediately saw something in him that others missed. “I really believe the Good Lord just creates people who are a little bit different, I saw that the first day I got to campus. There was no denying that. He played so hard. He was not ducking contact,” he told FoxSports.\n\nHenry knew Witherspoon wasn’t ready for Big Ten physicality and focused on reshaping Devon’s body and refine his game. Devon never said no to any challenges put forth to him.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks ended up drafting Devon with the 5th overall pick in the NFL Draft. Three Pro Bowls later,  he has been arguably the heartbeat of the turnaround of the franchise who are now Super Bowl Champions.\n\nAs the new defensive back’s coach settles into South Bend, Aaron Henry will be able to walk into the locker room with immediate credibility.

    "description": "The Thai legend seeks his second ONE World Title against an unbeaten Russian knockout artist on March 20.",
    "fullText": "A high-stakes World Title clash is set for ONE Friday Fights 147. Former long-time bantamweight Muay Thai king Nong-O Hama takes on undefeated Russian standout Asadula Imangazaliev for the vacant ONE Flyweight Muay Thai World Title inside Bangkok’s iconic Lumpinee Stadium.\n\nThe explosive showdown takes place on March 20, live in Asia primetime, pitting a living legend and a young superstar against each other.\n\nNong-O spent years establishing himself as one of the most dominant World Champions in ONE Championship history.\n\nAfter winning the inaugural ONE Bantamweight Muay Thai World Title in 2019, he defended it a record seven times against top-flight opposition, blending sharp counters, clean combinations, and devastating finishing power.\n\nHis reign came to an end in a first-round knockout loss to Jonathan “The General” Haggerty in April 2023, and although he picked up another win at bantamweight a year later, the 39-year-old began reassessing his long-term path as the division grew bigger and more physical.\n\nThat’s when he decided to move to flyweight, which presented a fresh opportunity.\n\nAt 135 pounds, Nong-O could lean more heavily on his speed, balance, and timing. His debut in the division came at ONE Fight Night 28 against Kongthoranee Sor Sommai in a closely contested bout. Despite that fight ending in a split decision loss, his performance showed he could immediately compete with the division’s elite.\n\nThree months later at ONE Fight Night 31, the Evolve MMA representative returned with clear adjustments and defeated Kongthoranee by unanimous decision, controlling the tempo and displaying sharper movement across three fast-paced rounds in their rematch.\n\nThat victory carried significance. It confirmed Nong-O was not simply testing himself in a new weight class. He had recalibrated, and he had earned his place among the top contenders.\n\nThe Thai icon was initially scheduled to challenge for the flyweight Muay Thai crown at ONE 173 in November last year. However, after his opponent was not medically cleared to compete following the weigh-in and hydration test, the bout was shelved.\n\nNow, Nong-O finds himself standing opposite a young contender on a seemingly flawless trajectory.\n\nImangazaliev’s path has been fueled by momentum. After making waves with five wins – including four knockouts – on ONE Championship’s weekly Asia primetime spectacle, he secured a main roster contract at ONE Friday Fights 122 with a first-round head-kick knockout of seven-time Muay Thai World Champion “The Angel Warrior” Panpayak Jitmuangnon.\n\nThe finish instantly elevated the Team Mehdi Zatout product into serious contention.\n\nHe reinforced that status by stopping Kongthoranee in the second round at ONE Fight Night 39 this past January, extending his pristine record to 11-0, earning a US$50,000 performance bonus, and strengthening his claim for a World Title opportunity.\n\nWhile Nong-O brings World Championship composure and years of elite experience, Imangazaliev arrives in this matchup with explosiveness, confidence, and an unblemished record.\n\nWith the flyweight Muay Thai belt vacant, ONE Friday Fights 147 will determine who gets to claim the division’s throne. Inside the hallowed ground of Lumpinee Stadium, a new king will be crowned.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants bolstered their offensive staff with the hiring of Matt Nagy as offensive coordinator, positioning him to guide second-year quarterback Jaxson Dart under head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nNagy, who previously coordinated for the Kansas City Chiefs alongside Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce—contributing to multiple Super Bowl runs—brings extensive experience after stints as the Chicago Bears head coach and earlier roles.\n\nDart, coming off an encouraging rookie campaign where he amassed 24 total touchdowns and just seven turnovers across starts, proactively sought insights on his new coordinator.\n\nESPN's Jordan Raanan reports that Dart engaged in multiple conversations with Mahomes about working with Nagy, emerging impressed by the feedback. During Super Bowl week, he also consulted Kelce, who offered glowing endorsements of his former play-caller.\n\nDart, fresh off a rookie season with 24 total touchdowns and seven turnovers, talked on multiple occasions with Mahomes about working with Nagy, according to multiple sources close to the QB. He came away impressed. He also told reporters last week that he spoke with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce about his former coordinator and received rave reviews.\n\nIn an exclusive Forbes interview, Dart elaborated on his enthusiasm.\n\n\"I can’t wait to get the chance to play for him. Just so many great things that are said about him and his coaching style and the work that he puts in, the passion that he has for the game,\" he said.\n\nDart praised Nagy as a \"quarterback guy\" who prioritizes putting players \"in the best situation and position to succeed,\" and tailors approaches to individual QBs. Dart noted Kelce \"didn’t have anything but tremendous things to say about Coach Nags,\" reinforcing positive views from Chiefs stars.\n\nNagy's scheme aligns well with Dart's strengths, with minimal expected adjustments from prior systems.\n\nThis \"loaded\" staff, including other ex-caches and coordinators, signals the Giants' commitment to Dart's growth as they aim to elevate their offense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Jaxson Dart spoke with Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce about Matt Nagy",

    "description": "Freshmen Nico Partida and Boston Kellner are making an immediate impact for Texas A&M, helping the Aggies to a 2-0 start and showing promise.",
    "fullText": "No. 25 Texas A&M is 2-0 to start the 2026 season after defeating Tennessee Tech by a combined 38- 13 in the first two games of the Opening Weekend series, led by 33 hits and nearly double-digit home runs, including star outfielder Caden Sorrell's three homers, combined with Baylor transfer DH Wesley Jordan's two home runs to start off his Aggie career.\n\nWhile the more experienced players, especially transfer Chris Hacopian, are making an immediate impact, second-year coach Michael Earley opted to start freshmen Nico Partida and Boston Kellner, and through two games, both players look the part, especially the Arizona native, who has recorded four hits and a team-leading four doubles, producing three RBI to start the season.\n\nSuiting up and starting in the SEC as a freshman is a big deal, and thanks to several Texas A&M reporters, including KBTX's Travis Brown, Kellner's parents drove over 20 hours to watch their son play, which must have been one of the more exciting moments after years of driving him to practice.\n\nOne of Earley's top commits, Kellner was named USA's 2024 National High School Underclass Player of the Year, and was considered a candidate to earn a starting infield spot at either shortstop or second base. After hiring Cliff Pennington to coach the infield, Kellner and Partida's starting futures were set in stone.\n\nNico Partida, who was highly regarded as an elite pitching prospect, was equally dangerous at the plate and was one of the better athletes coming into the program. Ranked as the 144th-ranked prospect in the 2025 MLB Draft, Partida withdrew his name and opted to play for Michael Earley, starting his career at third base due to Kellner's natural fit at shortstop. Through two games, Partida hit his first career home run on Friday night.\n\nStanding 6'0\" and over 200 pounds, Kellner is plenty powerful after hitting 29 home runs and hitting over .400 during his high school career, but his patience at the plate, focused on hits rather than homers, pairs well with Caden Sorrell and Gavin Grahovac, who have the ability to knock the ball out of the park at any time.\n\nFor Texas A&M to get back to the NCAA Tournament after missing the postseason for the first time in nearly 20 seasons, Kellner and Partida will have moments of struggle, and if the hits aren't coming, I don't expect their defensive performances to derail. So far, so good.\n\nSeeing double(s) ‼️\n\nBoston Kellner with his third double of the week, 2 RBI double run here!#NCAABaseball x 🎥 SECN+ / @AggieBaseball pic.twitter.com/f1TLlrL1c8\n\n— NCAA Baseball (@NCAABaseball) February 14, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M baseball: Freshmen Partida, Kellner make immediate impact",

We’ve dipped our toe into the pool of prospects with our weekly Mock Draft roundups, but things will really start to ramp up in the next few weeks.\n\nBut before we look forward to this April’s draft, let’s take a moment to look back. Every year, there are player we’re certain are going to work out that don’t. And there are draft picks we are sure will be busts who shock fans with how impressive they are.\n\nThe Lions draft history is littered with disappointments—although most of those came before this current regime. Today’s Question of the Day is:\n\nMy answer: Any time you talk disappointing picks, I think the discussion has to start with franchise quarterbacks who never lived up to their draft status. Joey Harrington, the third overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft has to be near the top of this list after lasting just four years, completing just 54.7% of his passes, averaging a 68.1 passer rating, and amassing a 18-37 record. Andre Ware was an even bigger bust. The seventh overall pick in 1990 ended up just starting six career games for the Lions after failing to beat out Rodney Peete and Erik Kramer for most of his career.\n\nOutside of the quarterback position, Charles Rogers is part of this conversation. The second overall pick in 2023, Rogers had a promising rookie season before suffering a broken clavicle that ended his year just five games in. He would never look the same again, with suspensions and reported lack of effort ending his career abruptly.\n\nPersonally speaking, I’m not sure there was a more disappointing draft pick result in the modern era than Jeff Okudah. I had very high hopes for the Lions first-round cornerback who many believed was a can’t-miss pick. Injuries derailed his career early, but he also just never lived up to the billing of the third overall selection. Though he remains in the league now, he hasn’t started a game since 2023, and he only played in 25 for Detroit before they traded him away.\n\nWhich Lions draft pick in franchise history was the most disappointing to you?

    "fullText": "Over a week after the Premier League’s January transfer window deadline, Arsenal youngster Charles Sagoe Jr. confirmed a loan move to Swedish side Kalmar FF lasting until January 2027.\n\nThe Swedish Allsvenskan runs on a calendar-year basis kicking off in April, and their transfer window doesn’t close until the end of March, hence the unusual loan period and the late confirmation of the move.\n\nKalmar will be involved in the Swedish Cup before that though, with three group stage games planned for February 21st, March 1st, and March 8th.\n\nAs for why Sagoe Jr. made the transfer, he explained his reasoning in an interview with Fotbollskanalen.\n\n“I felt I needed a fresh start and an opportunity to show what I can do,” Sagoe Jr. said (via Sport Witness).\n\n“When I found out that Kalmar was interested in me, I did my research. I spoke with the sporting director, the coach, and others at the club. Everyone spoke so highly of the club and how hard everyone here works to develop. It felt like the right place for me to develop into first-team football.\n\n“I will always be eternally grateful that I became part of Arsenal at such a young age. The club has constantly shaped me, pushed me, and given me the opportunity to improve at all levels. I hope to take a lot of that with me to this loan spell in Kalmar.”\n\nSagoe Jr. has been having a positive season with the Arsenal u21s up to this point, scoring five and assisting a further seven in his 14 appearances for the side.\n\nBut the 21-year-old made his senior debut for Arsenal well over two years ago now, and he really needs more first-team opportunities. Kalmar should offer him plenty over the next 12 months.\n\nSagoe Jr. will then have a decision to make on his Arsenal future, with reports suggesting his current deal expires in June 2027.",

    "description": "Former Wolves boss Pereira arrives with the club precariously placed above the drop zone and European commitments to contend with",
    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest have appointed Vitor Pereira as their fourth manager of the season following the sacking of Sean Dyche, with the Portuguese signing an 18-month contract as he looks to steer the club away from Premier League relegation.\n\nFormer Wolves boss Pereira arrives at the City Ground tasked with guiding Forest away from the drop zone. Forest are precariously placed in 17th in the table, three points above a West Ham side growing in confidence.\n\nPereira was sacked from his post at Molineux in November after 11 months in charge, leaving the Midlands club with only two points from their first 10 Premier League games of the season.\n\nHe previously worked under Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis at Olympiacos, guiding the Greek giants to a league and cup double in 2014/15.\n\nThe Portuguese follows Dyche, Ange Postecoglou and Nuno Espirito Santo of those who have been and gone in the Forest dugout this term.\n\nNuno was dismissed at the beginning of the season, less than four months from guiding Forest to European qualification for the first time in 30 years, after his relationship with Marinakis and the club hierarchy deteriorated rapidly.\n\nPostecoglou was appointed his successor, taking the reins after being sacked from Tottenham in the summer, but his reign proved ill-fated as he lasted just 39 days, failing to win any of his eight games in charge.\n\nDyche was brought in to steer the ship towards safety and helped lift Forest of the relegation zone, even being nominated for January’s manager of the month award.\n\nHowever, performances remained subpar and he was let go in the wake of a 0-0 draw with bottom club Wolves on Wednesday night, after which his team were booed off at the final whistle by their own home crowd.\n\nPereira will be seen as a short-term solution at Forest, having left seven of his last nine roles within a year.\n\nHe has nevertheless been appointed off the back of his proven ability to avoid the drop, having done so with Wolves in 2024/25.\n\nPereira replaced Gary O'Neil with the objective of sparing the club from relegation in December 2024, with Wolves at the time sitting in 19th place with just nine points from 16 matches.\n\nWolves went on to comfortably survived demotion and ended the season 16th in the table, 17 points clear of 18th-placed Leicester City.\n\nHis first assignment as Forest boss will be in Europe as they travel to Fenerbahce - a club Pereira spent two spells with between 2015 and 2021 - in their Europa League knockout play-off on Thursday 19 February.\n\nForest will then play host to Liverpool, who they pummelled 3-0 at Anfield in what was the undoubted high point of Dyche’s reign, on Sunday 22 February.\n\nForest said Pereira will be joined by coaching staff Filipe Jorge Monteiro Almeida, Luis Miguel Moreira Da Silva, Bruno Filipe Araujo De Moura, and Pedro Simao Capela Silva Lopes.",

    "description": "Arsenal predicted lineup vs Wigan: Rotation plans and injury latest before FA Cup clashArsenal’s predicted lineup for the FA Cup tie against Wigan reflects a familiar balancing act for Mikel Arteta,...",
    "fullText": "Arsenal’s predicted lineup for the FA Cup tie against Wigan reflects a familiar balancing act for Mikel Arteta, whose side remain firmly in the Premier League title conversation while navigating a packed February calendar. Arteta is expected to rotate heavily at Emirates Stadium, preserving key starters ahead of trips to Wolves and Tottenham that could shape Arsenal’s league season.\n\nArsenal’s squad depth has improved under Arteta, yet fixture congestion still demands calculated decisions. The Gunners played Brentford days earlier and have little margin for fatigue, particularly with Manchester City and others setting relentless pace at the top. Arteta’s approach mirrors the pragmatic rotations seen across elite Premier League sides chasing silverware on multiple fronts.\n\nA predicted 4-2-3-1 system has been widely suggested, with Kepa Arrizabalaga set to start in goal, offering continuity in domestic cups. Defensively, Ben White could return alongside Mosquera, Hincapie and Calafiori, giving minutes to players short of recent starts while protecting core starters for league action.\n\nArsenal’s injury latest remains central to team selection. Kai Havertz is ruled out with a muscle problem, while Mikel Merino faces a longer spell on the sidelines following foot surgery. William Saliba missed the Brentford match through illness, though that issue is understood to be short-term. Martin Odegaard also finished that match with knee discomfort, making him unlikely to feature in the cup tie.\n\nThese absences limit midfield options. Arteta may lean on Christian Norgaard alongside Myles Lewis-Skelly, offering a blend of control and youthful energy. Eberechi Eze, seeking consistency after recent struggles, could start in an advanced role.\n\nFor Arsenal, injury management is not merely precautionary; it is strategic. Recent Premier League history shows that title challenges often hinge on squad health. Liverpool’s near-miss seasons under Jurgen Klopp and Manchester City’s depth under Pep Guardiola offer contrasting lessons. Arteta appears determined to learn from both.\n\nThe predicted lineup circulating among reporters suggests:\n\nKepa; White, Mosquera, Hincapie, Calafiori; Norgaard, Lewis-Skelly; Madueke, Eze, Martinelli; Jesus.\n\nThis configuration would allow Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus to regain rhythm, while Bukayo Saka, recently back from a hip issue, may be used cautiously from the bench. Arteta’s system demands relentless pressing and positional discipline, and fringe players must show they can execute those principles.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, Arsenal will expect territorial dominance. Wigan, currently in League One, will likely defend deep, inviting Arsenal’s wide players to stretch the pitch. The midfield pairing’s task will be to recycle possession quickly while guarding against counter-attacks, an area Arsenal have occasionally struggled with this season.\n\nFor analysts tracking Arsenal’s title push, performances in these matches reveal squad trust levels. Who Arteta selects, and how they perform, often predicts usage during decisive league fixtures.\n\nArsenal’s FA Cup history adds another layer. Arteta lifted the trophy early in his tenure, using it to build belief. With the title race tightening and Champions League ambitions alive, this competition offers both opportunity and risk.\n\nWigan arrive as underdogs, yet FA Cup shocks remain part of English football’s charm. Arsenal’s rotation policy must balance freshness with cohesion. Too many changes can disrupt rhythm; too few risk burnout.\n\nFor Arsenal supporters, the predicted lineup is less about one match and more about trajectory. Title races are decided over months, not moments, and every selection decision reflects the broader ambition to return Arsenal to domestic dominance.",

    "fullText": "Mirko Cro Cop has made it clear he prefers fighters to step into the cage at their natural weight, rather than cut down.\n\nWeight cutting remains a hot topic across the UFC and mixed martial arts in general.\n\nMost fighters do not compete close to their natural size, opting instead for harsh and often risky cuts to gain an edge on fight night.\n\nConor McGregor was one of the many fighters who built his reputation while cutting weight. He looked drastically different when weighing in as a featherweight, where he captured his first UFC belt.\n\nMcGregor stunned the world at UFC 194, needing just 13 seconds to knock out Jose Aldo with a single punch.\n\nThe Irishman had a major size advantage over Aldo and didn’t fight again at 145 pounds after winning the title.\n\nInstead, he made his welterweight debut before later claiming lightweight gold, becoming the first-ever simultaneous two-division champion in UFC history.\n\nBut for Cro Cop, how McGregor achieved those titles takes some of the shine off them.\n\nIn 2023, he told Index Video: “Nowadays, the biggest scam in MMA is weight cutting. That’s the biggest scam in combat sports.\n\n“People need this explained because they don’t understand, being in a clinch with someone your own weight, five kilos lighter or 10 kilos heavier, that’s a night and day difference.\n\n“The rules are crazy…and then you see double champions,” he continued. “Double champions of what? For example, Conor McGregor. He weighs around 83-84 kilos…when he had the fight with Jose Aldo, he had 66 kilos on the scale and made the weight, but in the fight he had 78 kilos in the 66-kilo weight class.\n\n“Then he goes for a challenge, weighing over 80 kilos… He will go for the 70-kilo belt. Wait a second, while having 84 kilos?\n\n“Okay buddy, now fight at middleweight and win the belt there. You want to be a double champion? A legend? Then move up to light heavyweight and prove how tough you are.”\n\nIt is still early in the year, but weight cutting has already become a major topic again in the UFC.\n\nThe issue drew attention on January 23 after Cameron Smotherman fainted at the weigh-ins for UFC 324.\n\nAlthough he made weight, Smotherman collapsed after stepping off the scale, which resulted in his fight being called off.\n\nIn the lead-up to UFC Vegas 113, main event fighter Vinicius Oliveira opened up about his drastic cut to make bantamweight.\n\nOliveira began his camp 50 pounds over the division limit and still needed to lose 30 pounds as fight week approached. It is another example of how extreme cuts are still part of this sport.\n\nWhat Islam Makhachev thinks Anthony Joshua needs to ‘improve’ to dominate in MMA\n\nUFC fans remain split on Jon Jones’ legacy as drug test history lingers",

    "fullText": "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk used the calm authority of a senior figure to deliver a clear message following the FA Cup win over Brighton: Mohamed Salah remains central to Liverpool’s ambitions. Speaking after the 3-0 victory reported by BBC Sport, van Dijk stressed both friendship and footballing necessity.\n\n“Mo is still a leader and important for me, as a captain, to have around and to have him on the pitch and his presence benefits the team,” he said.\n\nThat message matters in a season shaped by transition under Arne Slot, with Liverpool balancing cup progress against uneven Premier League form. Salah’s goal and assist against Brighton served as a reminder that even in quieter spells, elite forwards often produce decisive moments. For Anfield Index readers tracking Liverpool’s xG swings and attacking output, this was another data point: Salah still drives Liverpool’s final-third productivity.\n\nMohamed Salah of Liverpool scores to make it 3-0 and celebrates Liverpool v Brighton and Hove Albion, Emirates FA Cup, Fourth Round, Football, Anfield, Liverpool, UK – 14 Feb 2026Liverpool Anfield United Kingdom EDITORIAL USE ONLY No use with unauthorised audio, video, data, fixture lists, club/league logos or live services.

There’s obviously a lot of focus on his goals at the moment because he puts the standards so extremely high, so when he doesn’t score as much he gets criticised.”\n\nAgainst Brighton, Salah’s involvement illustrated that point. His movement dragged defenders, his assist unlocked space, and his penalty settled nerves. Liverpool under Slot still rely heavily on Salah’s gravity — a truth evident in shot-creation metrics and pressing triggers across recent matches.\n\nFor supporters analysing patterns from Sunderland through Brighton and into upcoming fixtures, Salah’s influence remains structural, not merely statistical.\n\nSpeculation over Salah’s future has lingered amid interest from Saudi Arabia and the approaching final years of his contract. Van Dijk acknowledged the uncertainty but framed it in pragmatic terms.\n\n“[Mo is] the same as me – he’s got one more year [left on his contract] so we will see,” he said.\n\nYet he also made his preference unmistakable.\n\n“I always want Mo to stay because I’m a good friend of his and we’ve been through the highs and not-so-highs – I don’t want to call them lows – together for so many years.”\n\nSuch comments carry weight inside dressing rooms. Leaders rarely speak casually about teammates’ futures. Salah’s 252 Liverpool goals and record-equalling assist tally alongside Steven Gerrard underline his historical significance, and losing him would reshape Liverpool’s attack as dramatically as any tactical tweak Slot might attempt.\n\nLiverpool’s sixth-place league position, with 12 wins from 26 matches, reflects the challenge facing Slot in his first season. Van Dijk’s remarks about Salah were also a defence of continuity amid change.\n\n“Mo is a very important Liverpool player who has set the bar extremely high. I can only say for us nothing has changed.”\n\nHe added a reminder of unseen work behind the scenes.\n\n“There are so many things people don’t see what is important to try to become a successful team. Let’s see for the rest of the season how important he still is and can be.”\n\nFor Liverpool, Brighton was both a result and a signal. Salah’s quality endures. Van Dijk’s leadership remains steady.

    "fullText": "Martin Odegaard was introduced from the bench in Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Brentford in midweek, but he was ultimately unable to inspire his side to victory. Upon entering the pitch, he made an immediate impact and helped the Gunners take the lead against determined opposition.\n\nThe match carried added significance after Manchester City had secured victory in their own fixture the previous day, increasing the pressure on Arsenal to respond with three points. The Gunners pushed to extend their advantage, fully aware of the risks associated with a narrow 1 0 scoreline. Despite their efforts, they were unable to find a second goal to put the contest beyond doubt.\n\nBrentford, known for their resilience, capitalised and scored the next and decisive goal of the match. Arsenal continued to search for a late winner and created opportunities in the closing stages, yet they failed to convert their chances and were forced to settle for a single point. With the season approaching its conclusion and Manchester City close behind in the title race, it was not the result Arsenal would have hoped for.\n\nOdegaard addressed the outcome in his customary programme notes before a home fixture. As reported by Arsenal Media, he wrote, “We were looking strong but then the game changed again. Brentford played to their strengths and made it hard for us, as they have done to many teams all season. We needed to carry on playing how we had been before we scored the goal, so it was frustrating that we couldn’t do that. We should have been better at not conceding too many set pieces and throw ins, and then we need to do better when the ball comes into the box – myself first.”\n\nMartin Odegaard v Brentford. (Photo by Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nHis remarks explain the fine margins at this stage of the campaign. Arsenal remain in contention, but with Manchester City maintaining close pursuit, every dropped point carries significant weight in the battle for the Premier League crown.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

    "fullText": "Sheffield United left it late to snatch all three points against Portsmouth at Fratton Park on Saturday afternoon, as a dramatic 90th-minute winner sealed a 1-0 victory for the Blades.\n\nIt was the hosts who fashioned the first opportunity of the afternoon. Ebou Adams rose highest inside the penalty area but could only guide his header over the bar, setting the tone for a lively opening spell in which Portsmouth looked sharp and purposeful.\n\nUnited responded swiftly and almost broke the deadlock through Gustavo Hamer. The midfielder struck a low effort from a tight angle that beat the goalkeeper but cannoned off the outside of the post, much to the relief of the home support.\n\nChances remained at a premium, but the contest sprang back into life shortly after the interval. The home side came within a whisker of the opener six minutes after the restart when a cleverly worked corner routine saw Segecic drill a low pass to Swift on the edge of the area. His curling strike drifted agonisingly wide of the upright, with the Blades scrambling to regain their composure.\n\nAs the game wore on, it became increasingly scrappy. United gradually grew into the contest, showing greater control and composure in possession, though clear-cut openings were few and far between. With the clock ticking down, the match appeared destined for a stalemate.\n\nBut the decisive moment arrived in the 90th minute. Tyrese Campbell showed tremendous determination to keep the ball alive on the left flank, squeezing a cross towards the back post. Arriving at precisely the right time, Andre Brooks applied the finishing touch from close range to spark wild celebrations among the travelling support.\n\nPORTSMOUTH, ENGLAND – FEBRUARY 14: John Swift of Portsmouth looks to get past Kalvin Phillips of Sheffield United during the Sky Bet Championship match between Portsmouth and Sheffield United at Fratton Park on February 14, 2026 in Portsmouth, England. (Photo by Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images)\n\nAfter the final whistle, speaking to SUTV, Blades boss Chris Wilder singled out his side’s mentality as the defining factor behind the result.\n\n“Mentality, maybe over control and us imposing ourselves,” he said. “They were better at what they did in the first half than what we did. They never put us to bed, and we grew into the game in the second half.\n\n“We always thought at half-time, we talked about it, we can do a little bit better. I’m not sure they could do any better than that. We knew the game would settle down a little bit and it did.\n\n“Maybe I would have took a point with ten minutes to go and not been negative because this is a difficult place to come. To get a winner is brilliant for everybody, especially for our travelling fans.\n\n“The performance wasn’t a great performance today, but the mentality was top. It allowed us to get something from the game. You just saw the attitude towards the end, when the seven minutes went up. Obviously, it always goes to eight and a half, nine. They saw it out. Coops didn’t really have to make any huge saves.\n\n“They’ll say that they’ve missed some opportunities in the first half, but there was more pressure than create. From us, as I said, we had to dig a little bit deeper. It’s just Championship football at times, right the way through. I said it all along, 46 games. There’s some games you play really well, and you win. Some games where you dig in and get a result, and some games where you’re a little bit off of it. Maybe we’re a little bit off of it today, but to get something from these games is what picking up points is all about in the Championship.”\n\nIt was a hard-earned victory, and United’s first win at Fratton Park since 2003. Sheffield United are now just six points off the play-off spots.",

    "fullText": "The Olympic men’s hockey tournament is generating some great excitement. One reason for that is Canada’s number one line. The three top Olympians in National Hockey League scoring are all on Team Canada, and played together against Switzerland on Friday.\n\nCanada’s exciting number one line consists of Edmonton Oilers centre Connor McDavid of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Colorado Avalanche centre Nathan MacKinnon of Halifax, Nova Scotia and San Jose Sharks centre Macklin Celebrini.\n\nWe are seeing an incredible combination of amazing speed from McDavid and Celebrini, and terrific power from MacKinnon. In Canada’s win over Switzerland, McDavid led Canada in scoring with three points.\n\nMcDavid opened the scoring with his first ever Olympic goal. That was followed by assists on goals by Thomas Harley and MacKinnon. There was also great excitement in the second period as MacKinnon set up Celebrini.\n\nMcDavid leads the NHL in scoring with 96 points. MacKinnon leads the NHL with 40 goals, and McDavid is tied for the NHL lead in assists with 62. McDavid has 96 points, MacKinnon has 93 points and Celebrini is fourth in the NHL with 81 points.\n\nNikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning is third in the NHL in scoring with 91 points. However, he is not an Olympian because Russia is not part of the Olympic hockey program due to the war in Ukraine. Kucherov is also tied with McDavid in assists with 62.\n\nThe Canadians have France next to finish Group A. Canada has already clinched first place in the group, and are now focused on getting the number one seed heading into the medal round. Canada is a +9 after two games, while the 2-0 United States are at a +7.\n\nOLYMPICS: Watch Ilia Malinin suffer shock end to 2026 Winter Olympic run\n\nNFL: NFL teams with the highest winning percentages over the last 10 years\n\nCFB: Ole Miss given huge Trinidad Chambliss boost for 2026 college football season\n\nMLB: Former Dodgers World Series champion to sign with Angels\n\nNHL: Full list of NHL players in the 2026 Winter Olympics men’s hockey tournament\n\nVIRAL: Myles Garrett, girlfriend Chloe Kim share heartfelt moment after Olympic stunner\n\nThe post Canada’s top three players are on their number one line appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Harry Kane celebrated a milestone this weekend after reaching 500 career goals.\n\nThe England captain scored twice inBayern Munich's 3-0 win at Werder Bremen to pass the 500-goal mark for club and country.\n\n\"Really proud to reach 500 career goals. All these career milestones are something I'm really proud of. I try and take it in, I try and appreciate it,\"he said on social media.\n\n\"Obviously, big thanks to all the teammates over the years, all the coaches and all the staff that have helped me to achieve it. As always, we look forward to the next game, the next goal. I can start racking up a few more and see how far we can get.\"\n\nKane has become the first Englishman to officially reach 500 career goals. We've listed the five highest scoring English footballers of all time.\n\nSome might forget it, but football actually started before thePremier League.\n\nAlan Shearer's all-time record in the Premier League is the stuff of legend, but he only makes it in at number five here.\n\nShearer scored 409 goals for club and country during his career, 283 of which came in England's top flight. During that period, he won three Premier League Golden Boots and becameNewcastle United's all-time record scorer.\n\nDerby County's record scorer, Steve Bloomer scored 332 goals for The Rams over two spells with the club. Bloomer also represented Middlesbrough during a prolific career and scored 28 goals in just 23 caps for England.\n\nOnly Jimmy Greaves has scored more goals in England's top flight than Bloomer.\n\nJimmy Greaves scored a record-breaking 357 top-flight goals in England during a career in which the forward representedChelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham, alongside a short-lived spell in Italy at AC Milan.\n\nOnly Harry Kane has scored more goals for Spurs than Greaves, while he also notched up 44 goals in an England shirt. He was part of the squad that won the 1966 World Cup, but lost his place in the team to Geoff Hurst due to injury.\n\nDixie Dean's goalscoring feats are still spoken about almost 90 years since he last kicked a ball in England's top flight.\n\nDean scored a record-breaking 383 goals in 433 games forEverton, including a fabled 1927-28 season that is cemented in history.\n\nThat campaign, Dean scored a record 60 league goals in 39 games, an achievement unlikely to be eclipsed. The Birkenhead-born goal-getter also netted 18 times in just 16 appearances for England\n\nHarry Kane is the first-ever Englishman to reach 500 career goals.\n\nEngland's all-time record scorer has 78 goals in 112 caps for the Three Lions, having eclipsed Wayne Rooney's record in 2023.\n\nOther notable achievements for Kane include being Tottenham Hotspur's leading goalscorer and the highest-scoring Englishman in Champions League history (45).\n\nNow with Bayern Munich, he's bettered a goal-per-game in the Bundesliga, with 88 goals in 85 league appearances.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Few figure skaters at the Winter Olympics have seen Adeliia Petrosian compete in real life.\n\nShe might leave with the gold medal.\n\nRussia's exclusion from international sports events during its war with Ukraine means that the 18-year-old Petrosian has only skated one senior competition outside of her homeland, the qualifier that earned her place as a neutral athlete in Milan.\n\nAs she readies to skate to Michael Jackson's music in the short program Tuesday, no one besides Petrosian and her controversial coach, Eteri Tutberidze, can be sure of her form, or whether she's injury-free.\n\nBut if Petrosian can get past skaters like the U.S. “Blade Angels” trio of Amber Glenn, Alysa Liu and Isabeau Levito, and Japanese stars Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai, she'll shoot to sudden fame as the fourth consecutive Olympic champion from Russia.\n\nPetrosian is the latest star produced by Tutberidze, who revolutionized women's skating a decade ago by getting young girls barely in their teens to perform bigger and bigger jumps, only to have many of them struggle with repeated injuries.\n\nShe coached 2018 gold medalist Alina Zagitova, and a trio of standouts in 2022, when Anna Shcherbakova won the gold medal.\n\nBut the Beijing Games have been remembered less for Shcherbakova's triumph and more for the positive doping test turned in by another Tutberidze talent, 15-year-old Kamila Valieva. The case ended ultimately in a doping ban for Valieva that only recently ended, and an investigation into Tutberidze, though it found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Russian coach.\n\nTutberidze also was criticized for her harsh words toward her students in Beijing, while World Anti-Doping Agency president Witold Bańka said last week that he didn't “feel comfortable with her presence” at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nAs part of the fallout from the Valieva case, the International Skating Union increased the minimum age from 15 to 17 for senior-level athletes. That means Petrosian is one of the oldest women's skaters that Tutberidze has coached at a major championship.\n\nPetrosian has landed quadruple jumps in Russian national events, much like her compatriots were able to do in previous Olympics, and none of the other skaters at the Milan Cortina Games are able to match those high-scoring elements.\n\nThe big question is whether she's fit enough to do it in Milan.\n\n“I can't turn properly,” Petrosian complained in a Russian documentary following Tutberidze released last week. Tutberidze said Petrosian had been making progress in a difficult program around the new year, but suddenly “everything hurt.”\n\nThere's been no indication of how Petrosian's condition may have changed in the last month as she readied for the Olympics.\n\nFitness has been a factor for months. Tutberidze previously told Russian media that Petrosian wanted to give up her place in September's Olympic qualifier for lower-ranked skaters after an injury but ended up competing because the Russian alternate's fitness was worse.\n\n“Let's imagine it's just Chelyabinsk.” That was the advice Russian skater Petr Gumennik got from his coach ahead of skating in the men’s event, to pretend that the Olympics were happening in that provincial Russian city.\n\nFor a few seconds, it felt as if the competition might indeed be happening in Russia.\n\n“When I went out there I got so much applause, there was such noise, you can't compare it to anything,” Gumennik said after skating in the short program, where he was 12th. “That's Olympic support. It was unexpected and it gave me strength and confidence.”\n\nGumennik was greeted by fans waving personalized banners with his face, calling out “well done” in Russian.\n\nThere also was a Russian flag in the stands, even though Olympic organizers have barred it from the Games, where athletes such as Gumennik and Petrosian were vetted for any support of the war before they were allowed to compete as neutral athletes.\n\nAs the Russian with the best chance of a gold medal at these Olympics, there may be even more support when Petrosian skates. ___\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

They are judged for their skiing, the execution and difficulty of their jumps, and their times.\n\nIn moguls, which has been an Olympic event since 1992, skiers go down the course individually before their scores are ranked.\n\nKingsbury, who has amassed a record 100 World Cup wins, first won Olympic gold in moguls at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.\n\nHe collected his third Olympic silver medal Thursday when he lost the moguls final in an upset to Australia’s Cooper Woods. He also finished second in the event in 2014 and 2022.\n\nThis was Canada’s first gold medal of these Games.\n\nHorishima, 28, added the silver to his two bronze medals in moguls that he won earlier this week and in Beijing in 2022.\n\nAustralia’s Matt Graham edged Japan’s Takuya Shimakawa for the bronze in Livigno.\n\nOn Saturday, Australia's Jakara Anthony won gold in the debut of women's dual moguls.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "title": "Too old or too good to ignore: The Mohammed Shami conundrum",
    "description": "Mohammed Shami's consistent domestic form and World Cup pedigree raise questions about his continued omission from the Indian team. Despite his impressive wicket-taking record, selectors appear hesitant, possibly due to age and injury concerns, while his coach insists performance and fire are paramount. His return remains a strong possibility.",
    "fullText": "These questions swirl every time Shami’s name is omitted from the Indian team. Everyone knows about him: the rasping seam, the wobble that refuses to settle and the habit of arriving at big tournaments and leaving with bigger hauls. Yet, for all that familiarity, his absence from the Indian team has now become a recurring theme.\n\nIndia are understandably wary of pinning their World Cup hopes on two high-class but injury-prone fast bowlers in their thirties: Shami and Jasprit Bumrah. With the domestic pace cupboard thin, the instinct is to invest early in younger bodies. What is harder to justify is ignoring pedigree. \n\nShami is India’s highest wicket-taker in ODI World Cups: 55 wickets at an average of 13.5 in 18 games. The recent numbers only strengthen his case. In four Ranji Trophy matches for Bengal, Shami bowled an average of 20 overs an innings and claimed 20 scalps at 18.6. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he picked up 16 wickets in seven games. In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he prised out 11 at 22.5 in five games. \n\nShami played a crucial role in India’s 2025 Champions Trophy, claiming 9 scalps from 5 games. Yet, he was omitted from 2025-26 central contracts.\n\nBadruddin Siddiqui, Shami’s long-time coach, does not mask his frustration. “There’s fire in him,” he says. “He is serious about playing for India. I always tell him --- perform karte raho: India will need you,” he says. For Siddiqui, the equation is simple. A cricketer’s job is to perform; the selectors’ job is to decide. “Age should never be a consideration. Fitness, performance and fire: that’s what matters.” \n\nDomestic cricket, Siddiqui argues, is too easily dismissed. “Bowling 25 overs in a day is not easy,” he says. “There is no bowler who can replace him. There is a lot left in him.” \n\nFormer Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma offers a more nuanced perspective. “There’s a lot of difference between domestic and international cricket,” he says. “Even a T20 international takes a lot out of you: in terms of fielding, bending and chasing. There is no place to hide in international cricket.” \n\n“Perhaps, Shami is not yet at the exact match-fitness level the selectors want him to be,” Sharma notes. \n\nPerhaps, communication has faltered, he says. But Sharma is unequivocal about Shami’s ability. \n\n“Skill-wise, he is your second-best fast bowler after Bumrah. There’s no doubt in my mind that Shami will return.” Around Shami, competition has intensified—Arshdeep Singh’s left-arm angles, Siraj’s stamina, Harshit Rana’s development. But competition does not erase class. “Performs speaks for itself,” Siddiqui says. “Bilkul wapas aayega: he will be back,” he adds.",

    "fullText": "Fraudsters use stolen personal details to send out products, then post a fake verified and positive online review\n\nA package arrives but you can’t remember ordering anything.\n\nWhen you open it, you find some cheap, flimsy jewellery.\n\nIs it a case of mistaken identity or has someone accidentally selected the wrong address? You put it to one side and wait to see if anyone claims it or contacts you to ask if you got their gift, but no one does.\n\nWhile it is far from unusual for parcels to go astray, if one arrives with all your details on it, it is possible you have become an unsuspecting cog in a large-scale “brushing” fraud, a scam that is on the increase, according to online security experts.\n\nFraudsters need your postage details, which they will often obtain through a data breach. They then set up a false online account in your name on the shopping site they are selling their goods on and post a fake verified and positive review, apparently from you, about the products you have received.\n\nThese positive five-star reviews “brush up” their online ranking on the shopping site and also their credibility. In theory, this can then increase their sales. Oliver Devane of the security company McAfee says the goods need to be sent to the customer in order for a purchase and review to be verified. These fake verified reviews are often paid for.\n\nWhile it may appear to be a victim-free scam, it could highlight that your personal details have been hacked. It also risks bringing potentially harmful toys or cosmetics into your home, says Devane.\n\n“If it is some little toy that you give to your child, you’ve got no idea of the quality … which is a risk in itself. You have no idea where it came from and what it contains,” he says.\n\nThe package will come out of the blue and could contain anything from a key chain gadget to random homeware or even plant seeds. The contents will be cheap and likely to be of poor quality. This could happen at any time of the year, although deliveries of the goods peak at busy shopping periods.\n\nIn some cases, says Devane, the fraudsters may send QR codes or USB sticks with the product in the hope that people will scan them or put their into their computer. These will invariably lead to some malware being added to a phone or laptop that could result in data being stolen.\n\nIf you get something unexpected in the post, do not use it or consume it as it may be dangerous. For example, a toy may not be produced to proper standards or perfume may have harmful ingredients.\n\nCheck your online accounts to make sure there has been no unauthorised order and then report it to the marketplace that it was sent from.\n\nAmazon says third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and have a way to report them here. If you can identify the fake reviews in your name, then you can inform the shopping site you are dealing with and they can take action.\n\nIt is worth changing the password on your online shopping accounts and enabling two-factor authentication, says Devane.\n\nDo not try to return it to the retailer as this may prompt them to engage with you more and initiate more scams. Instead, simply throw it away after reporting it, he says.",

    "fullText": "Agentic AI apps first interview you and then give you limited matches selected for ‘similarity and reciprocity of personality’\n\nDating apps exploit you, dating profiles lie to you, and sex is basically something old people used to do. You might as well consider it: can AI help you find love?\n\nFor a handful of tech entrepreneurs and a few brave Londoners, the answer is “maybe”.\n\nNo, this is not a story about humans falling in love with sexy computer voices – and strictly speaking, AI dating of some variety has been around for a while. Most big platforms have integrated machine learning and some AI features into their offerings over the past few years.\n\nBut dreams of a robot-powered future – or perhaps just general dating malaise and a mounting loneliness crisis – have fuelled a new crop of startups that aim to use the possibilities of the technology differently.\n\nJasmine, 28, was single for three years when she downloaded the AI-powered dating app Fate. With popular dating apps such as Hinge and Tinder, things were “repetitive”, she said: the same conversations over and over.\n\n“I thought, why not sign up, try something different? It sounded quite cool using, you know, agentic AI, which is where the world is going now, isn’t it?”\n\nFate, a London startup that went live last May, bills itself as the first “agentic AI dating app”. Its core offering is an AI personality named Fate that “onboards” users during an interview, asking them about their hopes and struggles before putting forward five potential matches – no swiping involved.\n\nFate will also coach users through their interactions, if they desire, a functionality Jasmine described as helpful and another user said was “scary” and “a bit like Black Mirror’.\n\nRakesh Naidu, Fate’s founder, demonstrated its coaching ability in an interview with the Guardian. “I just feel a bit hopeless at the moment in regards to my chats. I feel like I’m not being engaging enough or meaningful enough,” he said into his phone. “I just need some kind of meaningful questions I can ask to really uncover the essence of people.”\n\n“I hear you, Rakesh,” said a synthetic female voice. “Here are a few ideas. One, what’s something you’re passionate about that not many people know?”\n\nNaidu, 28, said he started Fate in order to address shortcomings in the world’s biggest dating platforms – apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, which monetise the time users spend on them and “are literally profiting off keeping people lonely”.\n\nOther startups, from Sitch to Keeper, have launched across the US, hoping AI features can provide the novelty to win them a share of a crowded market. Sitch leverages the power of AI to manage vasts amounts of information, inviting users to “give us detailed feedback down to the hair colour, where they want to raise a family, and their fav music”; Keeper says it can find “a match with rare and real soulmate potential”.\n\nPart of the issue, Naidu says, are algorithmic approaches to matchmaking: Tinder at one point ranked users’ desirability through an Elo score, an algorithm originally used to rate chess players. On dating platforms, it’s a Hobbesian proposition – high-scoring users are shown to other high-scoring users, low-scoring users to other low-scoring users. “It’s very superficial,” said Naidu.\n\nAI, in theory, can offer a different way. Awkward as it may be to discuss your dating life with a chatbot, Fate does not rank you based on your responses, but instead uses an LLM to try to find other users who, based on their interview, might be similar to you. That approach, along with the AI dating coach, helps users to focus on authentic connection, said Naidu – “similarity and reciprocity of personality”.\n\nAmelia Miller, a consultant for Match Group (which owns Tinder and Hinge), worries about this approach.\n\nA recent study from the group surveyed 5,000 Europeans about their online dating preferences – and found that while many were interested in AI tools to weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users, most, 62%, were skeptical about using AI to guide their conversations. One obvious anxiety might be the dystopian idea of two agentic AIs steering a conversation, with the humans nominally in charge turning into little more than meatspace mouthpieces.\n\nMiller, however, who coaches people on their relationships with AI, says she sees many clients turn to an LLM for advice in the smaller, uncomfortable moments of building their relationships – asking AI how to craft a text, for example, or respond to an intimate question.\n\n“Often I’m trying to make sure that people aren’t turning to machines because turning to humans demands a level of vulnerability that has become uncomfortable now that there is an alternative,” she said.\n\nThe appeal of an AI coach such as Fate is that revealing yourself to it – your judgments, hopes and idiosyncrasies – involves no risk; it does not remember or evaluate. Friends do, and, says Miller, asking advice from them helps hone the skills for successful relationships.\n\n“Advice is really one of the key ways that people practice vulnerability in a more low-stakes environment – they build up to more vulnerable moments in a romantic context.”\n\nJeremias has been using Fate for several months. He said he doesn’t use the AI coach: “I could see it being helpful, but I mean there are obviously some concerns. Like the new generation are basically not going to have the real world experience of actually trying and failing.”\n\nThe app recently helped him to meet someone after a long period of being single in London. He’s not sure if this is because of the AI matching, or because Fate simply serves up only five matches at a time – no infinite swiping – and, excruciatingly, forces its users to write an explanation when they reject a potential match.\n\n“It makes the swiping more thoughtful. If I’m actually saying no to this person, what are the reasons I’m saying no to them?”\n\nHe and Jasmine both have second dates upcoming, both after being single for several years, they say.\n\n“It is exciting because you get like, you know, the butterflies in your stomach again, going on a date with someone, doing yourself up really nicely, wearing dresses, heels. It’s fun,” said Jasmine.",

    "description": "Jeff Mason, a former construction manager, and his wife faced financial ruin due to medical bills in the 1990s. Now, he drives for Uber at 76.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jeff Mason, 76, who drives for Uber in New Jersey for extra income. Mason and his wife liquidated their savings after his wife's cancer treatment, which she underwent before the Affordable Care Act's restrictions on insurance companies denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions. Over the last two decades, the couple has tried to financially recover. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAt age 10 in 1960, I started shoveling sidewalks and mowing lawns. I used to cut a lawn for 25 cents. I worked at a produce market, washed dishes, and worked in retail while growing up. My mother was sick for a few years and died when I was a senior in high school. I went to prep school for a year and then college for a year, but I quit to become a caregiver to my younger siblings. I chauffeured my brothers and sisters around for a few years before going back to college.\n\nMy father owned a construction company, and I worked summers for him. I moved from being a laborer to working with an engineering crew. I learned how to operate heavy equipment and large trucks, building bridges and highways. I also worked on wastewater treatment facilities and then moved into management. I did estimating and project management for a specialty construction company that worked on warehouses and loading docks.\n\nMy wife was a stay-at-home mom, but when our youngest daughter moved out, she decided she needed to do something more. She got a job for an environmental testing company.\n\nShe went to the family doctor, who determined she had the classic symptoms of a bad gallbladder. She had her first surgery and had to stay in the hospital for a few days. It wasn't until a few months later that the bills started coming in.\n\nOur son was getting married, and my wife's work was by choice instead of necessity. She voluntarily took a leave of absence and started to collect unemployment. We started to pay COBRA a little over $100 monthly to maintain her health insurance.\n\nA few months after that, she found a lump in her chest. We started to get bills from the doctors and the hospital. They told us we didn't have insurance. I said that we did. We were paying for COBRA, and I had all my canceled checks. She had surgery on her breast, but the hospital flat out told us that we don't have insurance. She was sent home a day after because we couldn't afford it.\n\nThe easiest way to understand what happened is that hypothetically, there were 300 employees at the company. We were paying 1/300 of a monthly premium. They weren't paying the other 299 parts of it. So even though the insurance company was taking our money, we weren't covered. They wanted me to go from me paying for my insurance and her paying for her insurance to essentially paying for four policies on one income. I had made too much to qualify for government assistance.\n\nWe went to a few lawyers, and each of them said we had no case because there was no intent on anybody's part to defraud us.\n\nI talked to one of the insurance companies that denied us, and they said we need to secure insurance for any other things that might happen, but she won't be covered for cancer treatments, as cancer is a pre-existing condition. Meanwhile, we didn't have any income coming in. The company said the only way she could get covered is if I divorced her, and she could collect welfare and get coverage.\n\nWe decided we were going to liquidate. We cashed in our IRA, sold our car, remortgaged our house, and emptied our savings. After a year, I started making monthly payments to everybody. We eventually ran out of money. It took me 13 years to pay off the second mortgage.\n\nI remembered getting a bill in the neighborhood of $246,000 from the hospital that covered the surgery and her recovery in the hospital. We still had a whole road ahead of us for aftercare. By the end of it, the bills totaled about $300,000. This all happened before the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe rebuilding process was slow. Our IRA was non-existent. I remember one day I came home and found my wife on the front porch crying because bill collectors were asking for more money. She never cried once through the treatments and the recoveries.\n\nOur credit was bad at that point. It took us a while to get a credit card. Our car broke down, and I was trying to work and had no way to get back and forth. I bought an inexpensive motorcycle, which I used to go back and forth on a construction site. Little by little, we built our credit back up.\n\nI worked 12-hour days during the week, a long half day on Saturdays, and pretty much every Sunday night. I also held side jobs. We started to put $10 away out of every paycheck. We lived very sparsely. We didn't spend any money. My wife didn't go to a hairstylist or buy makeup. We bought a home that was less expensive. I was also lucky to never have been laid off.\n\nWe've lived in the same three-bedroom house in New Jersey since 1988. From time to time, family members need a place to stay because of their situation. We've probably had 10 to 15 people live with us for months. This included my father, who spent his last five years here. Our house is known as the sanctuary. People come here to heal, whether mentally or physically.\n\nMy wife got involved in elder care after she went through that cancer situation, transporting people to and from the hospital. She made connections with people who had older parents or family members, and she started to take care of them on a part-time basis.\n\nI really didn't want to retire in my 60s, but we were getting older, and my wife wanted me to be spending more time at home. When I retired, I had some equity in my home and around $300,000 in my IRA. I also started to fund an IRA for my wife, which I built to mid-five figures. This allowed us to travel extensively within the US for the first few years. But a part of me felt like we probably weren't going to live that long anyway because everybody around us was dying.\n\nI was diagnosed with prostate cancer and have had several heart surgeries. I decided to loosen the purse strings and not worry so much about savings. In those years, we probably spent more than we should have.\n\nWe live on a 20-acre piece of land and are surrounded by nothing but woods. We live an isolated life and don't have many friends.\n\nI started driving for Uber to continue the lifestyle that we had while I was last working. I first aimed to make $100 a day. Some weeks now, I can make well above $600. I've had a few weeks over $1,000. I typically work nights and weekends. I haven't had to withdraw any money from an IRA since I started driving for Uber. The money anxiety started to go away.\n\nEven with my prostate cancer, pacemaker, and half a lung removed, my physical strength and stamina are remarkably good. As a mental challenge, I try to push myself in every situation I'm in. I find driving at night calming, and I like the aloneness of it. Driving bolsters the self-sufficiency aspect of my life, and I get to meet the denizens of the dark, who are often more interesting.\n\nWe both would like to leave something for our children, even though they are pretty well off. We don't know what their lives are going to be in 10 years.\n\nI think about how long I'll be able to drive. I know that if I retire today, we'll be able to make it work and could possibly remortgage our house. But everything is getting more expensive. Our children check up on us and want us to move closer, and we know they'll have our back when we get older. But I'm not too worried about our future.",

    "description": "Anthropic president Daniela Amodei said that, in the age of AI, we should \"prize the things that make us human\" — like literature degrees.",
    "fullText": "\"Learn to code\" was once common career advice. Now it might be: \"Learn to read.\"\n\nEnglish majors are often the butt of the joke, known for their unmarketable skills. (Does anyone want to hire me for having read \"Great Expectations\"?) Anthropic president Daniela Amodei takes the opposing stance. She doesn't regret her literature degree — and says AI will make the humanities more important.\n\n\"In a world where AI is very smart and capable of doing so many things, the things that make us human will become much more important,\" she said on ABC News.\n\nAmodei listed some things that make us human: understanding ourselves, our history, and what makes us tick.\n\nStudying the humanities is \"more important than ever,\" she said, while large language models are often very good at STEM.\n\n\"The ability to have critical thinking skills will be more important in the future, rather than less,\" Amodei said.\n\nAmodei's opinion is becoming more popular in AI. Steven Johnson, the editorial director of Google Labs' NotebookLM, told Business Insider that LLMs were causing a \"revenge of the humanities.\"\n\nHer brother Dario, the CEO of Anthropic, didn't seem to take the hint that humanities majors might come back in fashion in an AI-filled world. He studied physics at Caltech and Stanford.\n\nIndustry leaders are debating the helpfulness of a computer science major. In the age of vibe-coding, will a CS degree help you in tech?\n\nTheir takes diverge: OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor said the major was \"extremely valuable,\" while Google's head of Android, Sameer Samat, said it needed a \"rebrand.\"\n\nDaniela Amodei also described Anthropic's hiring strategy to ABC. She said the company wants employees with good people skills and communication techniques. Being \"kind and compassionate\" and wanting to \"help other people\" are good traits, she said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, people still really like interacting with people,\" Amodei said.",

    "title": "I got laid off from Amazon after 11 years. My high school daughter taught me the biggest lesson on how to move forward.",
    "description": "An ex-Amazon manager says his layoff in October 2025 was a shock, but he's using this time to build AI skills, focus on his health, and apply to jobs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hemant Virmani, a 47-year-old tech professional based in Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAmazon was part of my daily life for 11.5 years, and suddenly it was gone.\n\nThere's no right way or easy way to do layoffs. I watched my team members get laid off in 2023, and I know how difficult it is. Still, when I received an email in the middle of the night in October of 2025 saying I'd been laid off from my senior software development manager position, I was shocked.\n\nWatching my teenage daughter navigate her own difficult situation taught me the biggest lesson in how to move forward well. Now I'm applying to jobs and working on upskilling in AI so I can be proactive, not reactive, to the tech industry.\n\nOnly time will tell if this layoff is a blessing in disguise, but for now it has led to a refreshing change.\n\nI loved my time at Amazon, and I really feel as though it's a place for exceptional people. The number of quality brains in the office, throwing around ideas and solving a custom problem, was amazing.\n\nThe morning after my layoff, I had a mandated 30-minute meeting with my manager, and it actually went very well. We talked about the layoff, and he offered me support. He delivered it all to me in a very positive, human way, and it was really affirming.\n\nAn old manager also reached out to meet me at a local coffee shop the next day to spend time together and check in on my state of mind. I think he wanted to go about the layoffs right, which isn't easy to do.\n\nI felt attached to the layoff for the first few days; however, I knew there was no way to control what happened — I could only control how I reacted to it.\n\nMy daughter is a senior in high school, and she had an adverse situation happen to her last year that required recovery. How she reacted in that difficult time inspired me. Her mental model was: \"Challenges don't have to keep me from showing up for myself or for others.\" Her positive attitude was inspiration for me to do the same.\n\nI kind of learned from her that I had to take this layoff with positivity, keep my cool, and focus on what was next.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I lost my father and spent the next month in India supporting my family. I took about a month to settle my mind, reflect on what I wanted next for my career, and help my daughter finish her college essays.\n\nIt's been a very refreshing change to think about what I want next in my engineering career. I'm less focused on the size or name of the next company I work for, and more on what I'd be doing there. I'm looking forward to hopefully heading the engineering for something that has a great impact on customers. Right now, I don't think that can be done without AI, so I'm working on upskilling.\n\nI want to be proactive, not reactive, about the AI skills I'll need in the future. My team at Amazon used some AI tools, so I'm familiar with some, but I was only able to spend a fraction of my workday using them. Now, I'm building those skills myself.\n\nI started working on a hobby AI project a couple of weeks ago, to go hands-on with AI and be more grounded in the reality of what the AI landscape is like right now. It's been different, and a refreshing change, to build something myself rather than to study it, read about it, or work on a team developing it.\n\nWhen I had a job, it was easy for my first priority to be work. Now I'm making sure that my top priority is my health. I've been going to the gym four or five days a week, and I'm refining a health plan to follow even after I start working again.\n\nOnce I'm done at the gym, my time is a 50/50 split between learning AI and applying to jobs or networking. I'm applying for Head of Engineering roles where I'd own significant impactful initiative(s), averaging 2-3 applications every week.\n\nI made a post on LinkedIn about my layoff, and I received so many supportive comments, texts, and calls from people — some I hadn't talked to in decades. Someone from college whom I hadn't talked to in over 25 years reached out, and it was so nice. It felt like we never disconnected. I've also had multiple job leads come from my post which I'm following up on.\n\nAs of now, I have some worries about when I'll find my next job, but this time has given me the ability to work on things I wasn't able to before. I'm making sure I spend this time with a lot of positivity, not letting negative thoughts come around.\n\nMy advice to anyone undergoing layoffs is to realize that layoffs are not about you. It's about an environment that is driving layoffs. Secondly, now that this has happened, you can't go back in the past and change it. Look forward to what you can do next. How you react is very important.\n\nDo you have a story to share about being laid off from Amazon? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "AI agents are transforming what it's like to be a coder: 'It's been unlike any other time.'",
    "description": "AI agents are turning software engineers into overseers — and could be coming for other white-collar jobs. Many companies still need to adapt roles.",
    "fullText": "When Jesal Gadhia cofounded a software company a year ago, he expected that the AI agents it was creating would save its customers a lot of work.\n\nHe didn't predict the same tools would save his own team at the startup Cora so much time.\n\nAgents wrote all of the code the company uses — something that wouldn't have been possible before last year, he told Business Insider.\n\nThe company's six-person team produced what Gadhia calls \"unprecedented\" amounts of code in its first 12 months. Five years ago, he said, reaching the same level of productivity would have required 20 to 30 engineers.\n\n\"It's been unlike any other time that I can remember,\" Gadhia said of the impact of agents.\n\nAcross tech, AI agents powered by large language models are absorbing tasks that experienced engineers once handled. Software engineering is becoming a human-AI partnership — what Anthropic chief Dario Amodei has called the industry's \"centaur phase.\" And, as some tech insiders increasingly warn, what begins in software rarely stays there, with potential implications for other white-collar fields.\n\nAt Canva, the graphic design software company, engineering teams draft detailed instructions for AI agents to execute in the background — sometimes overnight. By morning, the work is ready, Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, said.\n\n\"Often, those results are really impressive,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nEngineers still apply a \"human touch\" to reach the company's quality bar. Even so, agents are delivering \"hours and hours and hours of work done completely autonomously,\" Humphreys said.\n\nThat's changing what it means to be a coder.\n\nHumphreys said that his senior engineers now often describe their jobs as \"largely review\" — checking AI output, steering one or more agents to follow a plan, and taking responsibility for the final product.\n\nTeams still spend time defining problems.\n\n\"The hardest part of engineering is to translate often vague, confusing, conflicting requirements into something that is production-ready,\" he said.\n\nAI can help, but doing it well requires \"precision of articulation\" in what's required, Humphreys said. It also demands \"mastery of the domain\" so engineers can quickly verify that what AI produces is correct — and prevent unnecessary complexity from creeping into Canva's roughly 70 million lines of code, he said.\n\n\"These tools can have you in a jungle before you know it,\" Humphreys said of agents.\n\nAt Cora, Gadhia compares AI to a typewriter: It generates the code, freeing engineers to focus on \"higher-level strategic architecture,\" meeting customers, and brainstorming features.\n\nCora builds agents that help software companies manage customer relationships. The agents take on tasks like gathering customer requirements, drafting presentations, and following up with clients, he said.\n\nThe AI will \"run around, do all this work, and you can supervise them,\" said Gadhia, who is also the San Francisco company's chief technology officer.\n\nAgents are also lowering technical barriers. Gadhia said Cora's CEO, who doesn't have a technical background, recently asked an agent to change the font on the company's website during a redesign. Minutes later, after an engineer reviewed the agent's work, the site was updated.\n\nAs agents handle more tasks — something that appeals to some, but rankles others — debate inside tech over AI has intensified.\n\nMicrosoft's AI chief, Mustafa Suleyman, warned in a recent interview that the technology will be able to handle \"most, if not all, professional tasks\" within 12 to 18 months. AI observers are divided over how disruptive the technology will ultimately be, with some forecasting a massive fallout for desk workers and others saying such fears are overblown.\n\nSome investors are growing cautious. Stocks in industries potentially exposed to having AI wash over profit centers — from finance to software to legal services — have taken hits.\n\nEven as agents become more powerful, they're unlikely to replace entire roles in various industries overnight. For one reason, technical challenges like hallucinations continue.\n\nAt the same time, many companies are still figuring out where AI fits into workflows, how workers should validate its output, and how organizations need to adapt, said Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture. There is often still a role for humans, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Technology for the sake of technology doesn't help,\" Ashraf said.\n\nFewer than one in 10 organizations has redesigned jobs to support AI adoption, Accenture found in surveys of leaders and workers in 20 countries during the final months of 2025. That's despite the share of organizations using agents across multiple functions rising to 31% from 27% in a mid-2025 snapshot.\n\nAlex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of AI infrastructure startup Arcade, said that to make the most of agents, workers should treat them like junior employees. That means telling the AI what to do, providing the criteria for success, and, if possible, providing examples.\n\nDo those three things and \"AI will sing for you,\" Salazar said.\n\nHe describes the workplace shift around AI bluntly. As it grows more capable, he said, workers such as software engineers will need to continually redefine their roles.\n\nAI is \"improving at an exponential rate,\" Salazar said. \"And you, as a human, are not.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about how AI is changing your job?

    "description": "A man who moved from  New York to Miami was prepared to feel lonely. He reached out to an old acquaintance for lunch and found a close friend to share retirement with.",
    "fullText": "Relocating to a new city is a mixed bag — especially when you're nearing retirement.\n\nWhen I moved away from home for grad school in 1990 at age 28, it was easy to socialize, since I was surrounded by classmates eager to make friends.\n\nBut in 2021, when I moved from New York to Miami for work at age 58, it was much harder to meet new people. The COVID-19 pandemic was still lingering, and I tried to connect with colleagues over a socially distanced lunch, but I couldn't really join clubs or meet neighbours. I found it hard to expand my relationships beyond work.\n\nI wondered how I'd make any friends, but later that year, I reached out to an old acquaintance and learned that it's possible to make good friends at any age.\n\nAfter arriving in Miami, I read articles about how to make friends as an adult. Some suggested rekindling old acquaintances. The logic seemed wiser than starting from scratch. I could reach out to people I already knew, or used to know even a little bit.\n\nI looked through my Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections for people who lived in Miami. I paused on Bruno's name because he brought back good memories. We had worked together seven years prior, when our respective companies collaborated on a project. I valued his ability to drive impressive results and radiate infectious positivity. He'd mentioned at the time that he appreciated how I kept the project on track.\n\nI hesitated to reach out. Our interactions had been friendly, but we'd only connected through work. Would it seem odd to Bruno to get an email from me after all these years? And was I leaping too far by suggesting a personal lunch?\n\nI swallowed my fears by crafting a friendly note, rereading it three times, and hitting send. The next day, Bruno responded warmly: \"Welcome to Miami. I look forward to having lunch.\"\n\nWhen the lunch came around a few weeks later, it went better than I expected. In addition to chuckling over old war stories about work, we discovered that we were both news junkies, avid travelers, and cyclists. At the end, Bruno said, \"That was really fun. You and your girlfriend should come over to our place for an Argentine barbecue.\"\n\nBruno and I started lunching roughly every other week. I was approaching 60 and itching to leave my job, and Bruno was already semi-retired. As someone on the cusp of a new life chapter, I valued having a friend at the same juncture.\n\nWe'd frequently talk about all things retirement, like the best investment strategies for our retirement portfolios, including how much risk to take and how many international stocks to hold. Discussions with a wise friend were much more satisfying than reading through reams of investment advice. We could debate, candidly admit our concerns, and test our logic. I became wiser and more confident.\n\nAs we grew closer, we discussed our hopes and anxieties about stepping off the corporate treadmill. I explained my desire, after decades of work, to release myself from the self-imposed pressure of always being productive. Bruno shared that he'd dealt with similar feelings, which made me feel validated. Our conversations gave me the confidence I needed to take the plunge and enter retirement in 2022, without feeling as guilty as I might have done about working less and enjoying myself more.\n\nSince I've retired, Bruno has been a valued companion. With no work schedules, we almost felt like we were playing hooky when we attended a weekday lecture by the Finnish ambassador to the US and took a day trip to see a touring Rembrandt exhibit. These post-retirement experiences are richer because I can share them with a friend who also enjoys exploring, joking, and giving his insights.\n\nI once mistakenly assumed that you can't form close friendships later in life, without the social intensity and openness of youth. When I first moved to Miami, I thought I'd make some acquaintances or group friendships, rather than forming any deep bonds. I was prepared to feel somewhat lonely.\n\nLast summer, Bruno and I escaped Miami's heat by flying to Upstate New York for a cycling trip. He fell on some railroad tracks, breaking his collarbone and ribs. In the emergency room, I whispered, \"Let's tell them I'm your brother, so I can stay past visiting hours.\" I sat by his side until his procedures were done at 4 a.m., keeping him entertained with the type of stories and gallows humor that only good friends share. We tried not to laugh too hard, so his ribs wouldn't jab him.\n\nBruno has since recovered and even bravely gotten back on his bike to meet me for meals again. During a recent get-together, he told me, \"Some people are really surprised that I found such a good friend later in life.\"\n\nI replied with a smile, \"What do you mean, friend? I thought we were brothers.\"",

    "title": "$100,000 a year on groceries, $220,000 on horses: What the Epstein files reveal about one billionaire's spending habits",
    "description": "Billionaire real estate mogul Mortimer Zuckerman's personal expenses are laid out in exacting detail in the Epstein files.",
    "fullText": "Buried deep in the millions of pages known as the Epstein files, one document offers a rare glimpse into how the 0.0001% live: a list of billionaire Mortimer Zuckerman's personal expenses for a year.\n\nThink of it as a financial diary from the uppermost stratosphere of wealth, where the ordinary rules of budgeting simply don't apply.\n\nTucked at the bottom of a portfolio performance report conducted by financial advisors at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the accounting tracks Zuckerman's spending from 2011. It includes the everyday and inexpensive, like $140 in parking tickets, to the extravagant, a $220,000 outlay to buy and keep horses.\n\nZuckerman, who is worth $2.8 billion, according to Forbes, made his money in real estate investing; he now owns and serves as the editor in chief of US News & World Report. He's donated hundreds of millions to various causes, including six-figure sums to fund neuroscience research at Columbia University and cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering.\n\nAt the time of the portfolio report, he owned properties in East Hampton, Manhattan, and Aspen, as well as a yacht named the Lazy Z, a Lexus, a Mercedes, and at least one private plane.\n\nHe and Epstein worked together in the past, financing the pop culture magazine Radar in the early 2000s. The newly released Epstein files suggest other ties: They include a draft agreement in which Zuckerman would pay Epstein's Southern Trust $20 million for estate planning services in 2013. Zuckerman also appeared in a book of messages put together for Epstein's 50th birthday, released by the House Oversight Committee last year.\n\nZucker and representatives for Zuckerman-cofounded Boston Properties and US News & World Report did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley report provides a fascinating snapshot of how the wealthy live — and spend — from detailed bills for commonplace expenses like clothes, home repairs, and childcare, to tallies for parties, wine, and fine art. Zuckerman's personal expenses for 2011 totaled $8.9 million, or roughly $12.8 million in today's dollars.\n\nZuckerman's federal tax bill topped $1 million. The real estate taxes on one of his oceanfront East Hampton homes, which was valued at $30.5 million at the time, came to $156,818.\n\nThe report details improvements and repairs across Zuckerman's properties, including a mold fix in East Hampton ($1,401) and a $223,769 payment for one month's repairs on his Fifth Avenue apartment, a 6,500-square-foot triplex overlooking Central Park.\n\nZuckerman paid more than $1 million for personal staff throughout the year.\n\nThe maintenance fee for Zuckerman's Fifth Avenue co-op totaled $261,187 for the year. He also rented an apartment about 10 blocks south of his primary residence for part of the year ($448,000), as well as a space in Manhattan's Kips Bay for four months ($18,232).\n\nRunning his various properties was not cheap. The landscaping bill for the year totaled $127,089 — nearly all for work at his East Hampton properties — and he also shelled out on furniture ($192,692), housekeeping ($39,322), security ($12,313), and pool work ($9,979). Groceries cost $113,946, not including wine, which had a separate $4,958 tab.\n\nZuckerman's charitable giving totaled $413,293 in 2011. At the time, his charitable trust was worth $167 million.\n\nThe breakdown includes travel for him and his family, his staff ($2,148), and the cost of his helicopter use ($5,458). There was no line item marked for his private plane.\n\nZuckerman's personal expenses ranged from clothing ($67,184 for himself, plus thousands more for his daughters) to medical ($72,526 for himself). School tuition ($59,621), camp ($5,145), and other activities, like ballet and piano, for his daughters totalled $82,128. Within clothing, cleaning was its own line item: $2,318.\n\nHorses made up the bulk of Zuckerman's recreational spending, totaling $219,074, including the cost of housing ($96,031), medical care ($37,577), and lessons ($5,564). Skiing ($50,777) and tennis ($7,717) were among other costly hobbies. His party bill totaled $22,526.\n\nMoving and storage costs were split between each of Zuckerman's properties, as well as a fee ($140,809) for his art.\n\nZuckerman paid for nearly a dozen insurance policies, including homeowners ($91,406), fine art ($86,380), and auto ($5,863).\n\nThe art bill included costs for repairs ($73,817), framing ($15,823), and conservation ($31,542), as well as moving, documentation, and appraisals.\n\nThis category includes various fees, subscriptions, loans, and bank charges, as well as petty cash. Zuckerman's Fifth Avenue and East Hampton homes each got a stash ($56,245), as did he ($15,000) and his nanny ($22,088.82).",

So significant that, when used strategically, they can help investors scale solely through tax savings.\n\nJill Green, a full-time physician who invests in real estate with her husband on the side, has used tax savings to grow her portfolio by roughly one property per year.\n\nOne of the strategies behind her growth: cost segregation studies, which allow her and other real estate investors to accelerate depreciation.\n\nRental property owners can deduct a wide range of expenses, including mortgage interest and insurance, as well as travel and equipment costs, thereby significantly reducing their taxable income.\n\nOne of the most powerful deductions is depreciation.\n\nDepreciation allows investors to deduct the cost of a building over its IRS-defined useful life: 27.5 years for residential properties and 39 years for commercial properties. To calculate annual depreciation, owners divide the building's value (excluding land) by the applicable timeline.\n\nFor example, if you buy a $1 million commercial building, standard depreciation allows you to deduct 1/39 of its value each year.\n\nA cost segregation study changes that math.\n\nA cost segregation study, often called a \"cost seg,\" accelerates depreciation by separating a building into components that can be depreciated more quickly than the building as a whole.\n\nEngineers analyze the property's internal and external elements — such as flooring, electrical systems, plumbing, and HVAC — and reclassify certain portions into shorter depreciation categories of five, seven, or 15 years. They may determine that an electrical outlet is not expected to last 39 years, for example, and, instead, is a three-year asset.\n\nSo, instead of depreciating the entire $1 million building over 39 years, portions of it may qualify for faster write-offs. That acceleration can dramatically increase first-year deductions.\n\nUsing the same $1 million example: rather than deducting about $25,600 in year one (1/39 of $1 million), an investor could potentially deduct hundreds of thousands of dollars upfront through accelerated and bonus depreciation.\n\nClaiming larger deductions early in ownership reduces tax liability and increases available cash.\n\n\"You can take a big chunk in those first couple of years and basically put yourself into a loss position because the deduction is so large,\" CPA Kristel Espinosa told Business Insider. \"If you don't need all of the loss in the current year, that loss carries over into subsequent years, so those losses could shelter the rental income from this property for years to come.\"\n\nNote that, in most cases, depreciation can offset passive income — such as rental income — but not active income like W-2 wages. However, investors who qualify as real estate professionals under IRS rules can use rental losses to offset active income. Green's spouse qualifies for real estate professional status, or REPS, which makes their cost segregation studies especially powerful: the accelerated depreciation deductions can offset active income, delivering significant and immediate tax savings that wouldn't otherwise be available.\n\nA cost seg study typically costs several thousand dollars and can take one to two months to complete. Whether it makes sense depends on the property's size, purchase price, and the investor's tax situation.\n\nEspinosa said the strategy often works best for higher-income investors who own commercial properties or large portfolios.\n\nAs a general rule, \"a cost segregation study typically allows 20% to 40% of a building's cost to be reclassified into shorter depreciation periods,\" she said. \"This can generate first-year tax savings of $50,000 to $150,000+ per $1 million in building cost, depending on the study results and your tax situation.\"\n\nShe gave the example of a $15 million commercial building. If $5 million is reclassified into shorter-life assets and qualifies for bonus depreciation, that could generate $3 million in deductions. At a 37% federal tax rate, that's roughly $1.11 million in federal tax savings, before accounting for state taxes.\n\nIn one case, Espinosa said a client saved about $1.8 million in taxes after paying roughly $10,000 for the study. That wasn't an extreme case for her client base, which includes high-income earners in top tax brackets who typically own large portfolios and commercial buildings, she said.\n\nStill, cost seg studies don't make sense for every property. They're generally more valuable for commercial buildings, which have more components to reclassify, and for higher purchase prices.\n\nGreen said she consults her CPA before ordering a study. When she bought a $123,000 property, it didn't make financial sense, especially since she planned to sell it quickly.\n\nEspinosa advises investors to work closely with experienced CPAs and cost segregation specialists and to retain detailed engineering reports in case of an audit.\n\n\"Cost segregation is powerful,\" she said, \"but it requires careful execution.\"",

    "fullText": "My wife and I are about to take our two kids to Disneyland … and I'm absolutely terrified.\n\nNot because I don't want to go. My nearly 3-year-old carries his Mickey Mouse stuffie everywhere. He sleeps with it. Eats with it. When he sees Mickey in real life, he'll lose it. I can't wait for that.\n\nHere's the problem: I'm really worried about how much it's going to cost. The price of visiting Disney — and competing amusement parks — has been rising for years. But the upper end of what it can cost, depending on the experience you want, has entered rarefied air.\n\nIn a recent Business Insider documentary, we dug into Disney's history to better understand the real reason the Mouse House has gotten so expensive. When Disneyland opened in 1955, admission was basically pocket change. Back then, it cost 50 cents for a child and $1 an adult, to get in, or $6 and $12, respectively, in today's dollars adjusted for inflation. Going on the rides cost more.\n\nToday, admission plus rides can run close to $200 a day, although the lower tiers are cheaper. Then there's the food. The merchandise. Not to mention the enormous crowds and the endless lines if you don't pay for a line-jumping pass. The happiest place on Earth? My wallet might disagree.\n\nDisney parks have been a bright spot for the company post-COVID under the stewardship of parks czar Josh D'Amaro. He is set to succeed Bob Iger as CEO.\n\nThe question now is whether Disney diehards start to change course.\n\nOne hardcore Disney fan who still visits multiple times a year told us she's cut back on extras and avoids premium shortcuts or add-ons.\n\nAnother family dropped nearly $10,000 on Disney World and came home with a list of what they'd cut next time.\n\nThere are Disney-specific budgeting stories, too, showing how families save on tickets, food, and hotels. I'm taking notes.\n\nMy real fear isn't the credit-card bill. What if my kids love it? What if they beg to go back? What if this trip becomes such a core memory — priceless, one might say — that they measure other vacations against it?\n\nWhat are your best Disney tricks and hacks?

    "description": "After working with Ukrainian soldiers, the 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards now has a \"drone hub,\" an obstacle course,\" and rigorous drone training.",
    "fullText": "An elite British Army battalion is going all in on drones after working closely with Ukrainian soldiers and seeing how central these systems have become in modern warfare.\n\nThe 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards now has 78 of its 300 members qualified as drone operators, its commanding officer, Lt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, told Business Insider. The unit has big plans to increase its training and work with drones further.\n\n\"That just gives you an idea of how important this is,\" he said.\n\nThe battalion has built a training facility with drone warfare in mind, and its soldiers are heavily invested, he said, sharing that he's got soldiers asking if they can get in on the weekends and log some flying hours.\n\n\"That to me is absolutely incredible. Soldiers asking to do extra training over the weekend tells me that we must be doing something right, and it's capturing the imagination of that generation,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nUkraine has shown that drones are part of the \"future of warfare,\" he said, and that means knowing how to use them in combat is something that soldiers \"need to be experts at.\"\n\nWestern militaries, including the UK and US, are studying the drone war in Ukraine closely. The conflict has become the most drone-saturated in history, forcing armies to rethink how they fight.\n\nSome units are doing more than watching from afar though. The 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards was able to learn directly from Ukrainian soldiers during a UK-led training initiative called Operation Interflex.\n\nWhile the operation is designed to train Ukrainian soldiers, the exchange has not been one-way. Ukrainian troops — many with recent front-line experience — have shared hard-won lessons. Ukraine has far more experience employing drones at scale than Western militaries.\n\nIrwin-Clark said his battalion is \"learning the lessons on behalf of the rest of the army by picking them straight up from Ukrainians who, in some cases, were coming straight to us from the front line, passing on the benefit of their knowledge.\"\n\nHe said he did not expect the learning to run so deeply in the other direction when the work first started. \"I think what I hadn't anticipated over a year ago when we started our stint on Interflex is how much we would learn.\"\n\nThe battalion has built an obstacle course so soldiers can train to fly drones accurately. Irwin-Clark said he expects at least one module of each week's training cycle to be drone-related.\n\nOther battalion efforts include the recently built \"drone hub,\" a center where soldiers can fix drones, do virtual training, and use 3D printing to make drone parts. Irwin-Clark described it as \"a new thing,\" sharing that \"no other unit in the British Army has one of these yet.\"\n\nThe battalion printed its first drone body just last month. The aim is to eventually set up the hub in the back of a vehicle so that its technology, like 3D printing, can be accessible on the move and soldiers can make and repair drones in the field. Irwin-Clark said the effort is \"in its infancy.\"\n\nThe 3D printing and use of simulators for drone training came directly from Ukrainian recommendations, Irwin-Clark said. These are practices Ukraine's military has deemed essential.\n\nThe battalion has copied other pieces of Ukrainian doctrine that Ukrainian soldiers told it about, like using anti-drone nets and viewing 60 hours as the minimum flying time typically needed to be competent.\n\nIrwin-Clark said the biggest shock for him was how fast his soldiers were able to demonstrate drone skills. \"What surprised me the most was how quickly people picked it up.\"",

In January, the company also said it planned to lay off 775 employees at its distribution centers, citing efforts to accelerate the use of \"advanced technology and automation.\"\n\nNike had several leadership shake-ups in 2025, including promoting at least four insiders to senior roles reporting directly to CEO Elliott Hill.\n\nHill, who rejoined the company in October 2024, has told investors that Nike is aligning its employees around five key action areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and connecting with consumers on the ground in their communities.\n\nThat strategy plays into Nike's efforts to focus its marquee brands — Nike, Jordan, and Converse — on key sports such as running and basketball. It's also pushing a new collaboration, NikeSKIMS, an athleisure brand for women.\n\n\"We are in the midst of realignment at Nike,\" Nike said in a July statement to Business Insider. The realignment and sport strategy aim to \"create sharper distinction and dimension\" for its brands, the company said.\n\nHere's what some key Nike roles can earn, based on work visa data for the year ending September 30.\n\nThe salary data includes information from Nike Inc. and some subsidiaries, such as its retail services arm and Air Manufacturing Innovation division.

    "fullText": "Devan Barker has never spent so long job-hunting.\n\nThe 31-year-old from West Hollywood is looking for serving and bartending gigs. After a bad electric scooter accident, Barker spent months out of work. Meanwhile, hiring for hospitality jobs has dropped off. Now he spends his days looking for openings on job boards like Indeed, Culinary Agents — and Grindr.\n\nGrowing up in Georgia, dating apps like Grindr were the \"gay newspaper,\" Barker said. Why not look for a job there? He's had some wins. One connection got him an interview, but the manager later decided to explore promoting in-house for the position. Other bartenders and waiters on the app have asked on Barker's behalf if their bosses are hiring.\n\n\"I've noticed that I've had more success on these apps,\" he said. \"There's no room for embarrassment.\"\n\nBarker isn't alone. In a recent Glassdoor community pool, 29% of respondents said that they were using or considered using dating apps for career purposes. In a rough job market filled with AI résumé scanners (and AI-written résumés), many applicants are desperate to make their case to a real person.\n\nNetworking through dating apps isn't new. Business Insider spoke to professionals who found clients, referrals, or simply got their foot in the door — many of whom told stories that dated back years.\n\nSo, have Tinder and other dating apps quietly become the new LinkedIn? These workers think so.\n\nLexie Flynn, a 27-year-old social media manager from Philadelphia, met a client on Hinge. She was looking for side gigs. He was tired of the language barrier between him and his social media operator in Indonesia.\n\nThere was romantic interest \"on both ends,\" Flynn said, but the conversation quickly veered into work. It stayed professional \"once we realized we could help each other out\" in business, she said.\n\nShe audited his social media for free and sent him a review via Instagram DM. He met with his marketing manager, then all three of them connected, and she got the gig. She's run his social media since October.\n\n\"When I do see 'business owner,' that's the first place my mind goes to,\" Flynn said. \"I'm 100% stalking their business on social media.\"\n\nThere's a stickiness to mixing romance and the workplace. At what point does a Bumble match move from bound for the bedroom to the office?\n\nBarker is direct with his Grindr connections. When someone asks, \"How are you?\" he responds, \"Job-hunting.\"\n\nIs working alongside a match a bad idea? It depends.\n\nSean Horan, a professor of communications at Fairfield University who focuses on workplace relationships, said that romantic connections can be shorter-lived — and thus less messy for an employer — than other types of relationships.\n\n\"Someone working with a sibling or a best friend could be a relationship that's stronger, that's closer and has more loyalty than any romance would,\" Horan said.\n\nDating app users may refer their matches to entirely separate parts of large organizations, ensuring little to no face time. But there's no guarantee — and there's always the chance things could get awkward down the line. It's also possible they wouldn't be on the same team or in the same office.\n\nVigna Grace, a 26-year-old product manager from London, would ask her Tinder dates about their jobs. This was back when she was 21, single, and unsure of what path she wanted to take after graduating with a computer science degree.\n\nShe said the dates gave her an \"inside look\" at different companies she could work at. Grace went on dates with employees at tech companies like Google and Meta, as well as with investment bankers and venture capitalists, she said. Some referred her for jobs, like a match at Spotify.\n\nHow does Grace draw the line between a romantic and professional connection?\n\nGrace said that she wants to be with someone who loves their job, so work is a natural talking point on a date. She's curious, not digging for professional connections but treating them as a \"nice side effect.\"\n\nShe's not worried about running into a Tinder match in the office, either.\n\n\"I've always liked to work from home,\" she said.",

    "description": "From Costco to Toyota, global companies are filing lawsuits to secure tariff refunds should the Supreme Court decide to strike down Trump's duties.",
    "fullText": "Top global companies want their money back from the Trump administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court is in the process of deciding whether Trump's tariffs enacted under an emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are legal. To companies that may have already paid billions in duties over the past year, a ruling against tariffs may not be enough to recoup funds.\n\nSmall businesses mainly spearheaded the initial wave of lawsuits against tariffs, but some of the largest global corporations are now filing lawsuits in fear that they may not be refunded should the Supreme Court overturn the duties.\n\nTypically, duties paid to the Customs and Border Protection undergo a process called liquidation within a year of the entry of the goods in question. Once liquidation occurs, the chances of getting any money back become slim — and for many companies, their time is running out.\n\nFrom Costco to Toyota, here are some of the largest global companies that want their tariffs refunded.\n\nCostco is seeking a \"full refund\" of tariffs it paid under the IEEPA, arguing the levies were imposed illegally and could soon become unrecoverable.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed with the Court of International Trade in December 2025, Costco's lawyers argued that the law, first enacted in 1977, has never authorized tariffs.\n\n\"The text of IEEPA does not use the word 'tariff' or any term of equivalent meaning,\" the company wrote.\n\nThe company also said in the complaint that it filed its own suit because even if the Supreme Court ultimately rules the tariffs unlawful, importers are not guaranteed refunds without separate court judgments. Costco said that its imports could begin entering \"liquidation\" as early as mid-December, which is a customs process that could permanently close the door on refunds. Customs has already declined to extend that timeline, Costco said in the suit.\n\nCostco did not disclose how much it has paid in duties.\n\nSubsidiaries of the Toyota Group, Toyota Tsusho America, Toyota Tsusho Canada, and Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics America filed a lawsuit in November 2025 to secure refunds.\n\n\"And this action is necessary now because the entries for which Plaintiffs paid tariffs imposed under authority of IEEPA will begin to become liquidated and final as a matter of law by January 31, 2026,\" the companies wrote in the complaint.\n\n\"Plaintiffs seek relief from the impending final liquidations to ensure that their right to a complete refund is not jeopardized,\" they added.\n\nThe auto sector has been among the industries most exposed to Trump's tariffs, which added duties on vehicles as well as on steel and aluminum. In May 2025, Toyota said that the higher import and export rates could cost the company about $1.3 billion over a two-month period.\n\nBYD's lawsuit marks the first from a Chinese carmaker against Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe EV giant filed the suit on February 9 and detailed nine executive orders related to trade that affected the company, including tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum, steel, and exports from China.\n\nIn the complaint, BYD wrote that it is seeking a refund of \"all IEEPA tariffs paid to date\" and \"all IEEPA tariffs that may be paid in the future.\"\n\nThe company also said that aside from China, its imports into the US from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Poland were also affected.\n\nThe Chinese carmaker does not sell passenger cars in the US, but its business here includes buses, commercial vehicles, batteries, energy storage systems, and solar panels. According to its website, the company's truck plant in Lancaster, California, employs 750 workers.\n\nOn December 10, 2025, Goodyear Tire & Rubber filed its complaint and request for relief, and detailed how tariffs, especially the ones imposed on China, which changed nearly a dozen times, affected the company.\n\n\"Where CBP acts in a ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion) in imposing a duty, the entry's liquidation cannot be protested,\" wrote Goodyear in its complaint as to why the company is asking the court to block liquidation.\n\nGoodyear sources a significant portion of its raw materials from Southeast Asia, where the rubber plant is widely commercially grown. According to Goodyear's website, the company's manufacturing facilities are located across 23 countries, including China, the US, Germany, Poland, and Thailand.\n\nAlcoa Corp, one of the world's top producers of aluminum, bauxite, and alumina, filed a complaint for tariff refunds on November 26, 2025.\n\nThis case is one of several dozen that were consolidated with AGS Company Automotive Solutions v. United States Customs and Border Protection, which became the lead case regarding IEEPA duty liquidation as of December 2025.\n\nAs of June 2025, tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports increased to 50%.",

The snowpack crisis, which could mean a drier, more wildfire-prone summer, is coming as states are racing unsuccessfully against a deadline to agree on terms to share water in the Colorado River Basin, the source of water for 40 million people across seven states in the West.\n\n“Barring a genuinely miraculous turnaround” in the remainder of the winter, says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, the low snowpack “has the potential to worsen both the ecological and political crisis on the Colorado Basin, and then also produce really adverse wildfire conditions in some parts of the West.”\n\nData provided by the US Department of Agriculture show that as of February 12, snowpack was at less than half its normal level in areas across nine Western states—some of the lowest levels seen in decades. It’s common for a particular basin or small area of the West to have low snowpack at this time of year. What’s worrisome, Swain says, is how widespread the snow drought is, stretching in a swath from the bottom of Washington to much of Arizona and New Mexico, and touching as far east as Colorado.\n\n“The numbers are really, really bad,” Swain says. “If this were November, they might be less meaningful. We're not in November—we're heading toward mid-February. The normal numbers are pretty high. To be at half of them means that, in absolute terms, the deficit is large.”\n\nAs much of the East Coast has frozen in the first weeks of the year, many Western states are experiencing some of their warmest winters on record: Parts of Colorado saw temperatures close to 80 degrees Fahrenheit at the start of this week. While precipitation has remained steady in many states—parts of Washington even saw disastrous flooding in December—it’s simply not cold enough in many areas for snow to fall or stay in snowpack.\n\nA study released last year by researchers at Dartmouth found that climate change has led to a reduction in snowpack levels across the northern hemisphere over the past 40 years. A snowpack deficit has some worrisome implications for the West for the rest of the year. Forests with low snowpack dry out faster, and are less resilient against wildfire when the hot season comes. (Wildfire-ravaged forests may also, in turn, be less prepared to keep snowpack around; some recent research has shown that in areas that have recently been burned, snow melts faster than other places.)\n\nMuch of the water supply for the West, including the crucial Colorado River Basin, is set during the winter. Snowpack that accumulates in the cold months melts in the spring; in years with healthy snowpack levels, that water makes its way into streams and reservoirs. Current conditions pose a threat to this dynamic.\n\n“In some places, we don't have a traditional drought—what we've got is a snow drought, where precipitation has been near or above average, but where record warmth has really been driving just a complete decimation of the existing snowpack,” says Swain. The warmth in other areas, he says, has “caused the precipitation that has fallen—which in some cases has been reasonably abundant—to fall as rain, even at 7,000 and 9,000 feet elevation.”\n\nSwain says it’s still early enough in the season that there could be some significant storms to help replenish snow levels in some areas. “The problem is that we've accumulated such a large deficit right now—even if we have near or somewhat above average snowfall for the next few weeks, that might just sort of keep pace with the usual accumulation for the rest of February, without really erasing the accumulated deficit,” he says.",

    "title": "I compared WinApps and WinBoat, which integrate a Windows VM to desktop Linux",
    "description": "Hands-on: Can't live without Adobe? Get on board WinBoat – or WinApps sails a similar course",
    "fullText": "Hands-on Run real Windows in an automatically managed virtual machine, and mix Windows apps in their own windows on your Linux desktop.\n\nWinApps and WinBoat both deliver the same functionality: they run real Windows in a VM and export native Windows apps in individual windows onto your Linux desktops, integrated with your native Linux applications, via the wizardry of Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol. RDP was Microsoft's answer to X11, before the great minds of the Wayland project came along to tell us that we don't need such things.\n\nFor all the abilities of modern Linux, there are some apps – especially paid commercial ones – that still require Windows. We outlined three ways to run Windows apps on Linux in May 2025. WINE is amazing and the current version can run a lot of Windows apps smoothly on Linux – but there are limits to its compatibility: for instance, there's no Microsoft Store. The main alternative is to run a real copy of Windows inside a virtual machine, and when you need those specific tools, fire up the VM, and use the apps inside it. (Since late 1994, the desktop version of VMWare is free to use – and it both offers pretty good performance for Windows guests, and some helpful integration tools.) Even so, managing a VM does require some effort, and moving your files and data between host and VM inevitably means some extra legwork.\n\nBoth WinApps and WinBoat aspire to make this seamless and almost invisible, using a real copy of Windows running in a hidden virtual machine that uses Linux's built-in native virtualization tools rather than add-on hypervisors. The goal is to offer better compatibility than WINE, near-native performance, and better integration between host OS and virtualized apps. The key differences are control and maturity. WinApps is quite mature and very flexible, but it needs you to either have some virtualization skills or to invest effort in learning and editing config files. WinBoat is new, hasn't reached version 1.0 yet, but it automates as much as possible away to make life easy.\n\nWinApps running OneNote 2016, complete with an old note synched from the Microsoft Cloud - click to enlarge\n\nWinApps is by some years the more mature of the two. Its creator Ben Curtis started the original project in about 2020, but development went dormant a couple of years ago, leading to a \"hard fork\" that is actively working on a modernized version.\n\nWinApps is very flexible, and boasts compendious documentation. It supports three different ways to run Windows: two flavors of container, or directly using the kernel's KVM virtualization. If you're comfy with using container tools, then that's the easier way, and WinApps supports using either Docker or Podman. The main difference is that Docker requires root privileges, but Podman doesn't. Alternatively, WinApps can directly control a Windows instance inside KVM using the libvirt API, but the docs do warn:\n\nWhile this method requires considerably more manual configuration, it also provides greater virtual machine customization options.\n\nThey are not kidding. The libvirt method is much more complex to install, but it's also much more flexible – for instance, this way, the hypervisor can even run on a different computer. For example, if you have a well-specced laptop with a broken screen sitting around doing nothing, you could dedicate a whole PC to the Windows VM, separately from your desktop box.\n\nWe tried an initial test run using Docker containers, but even though we predicted the rise of containers 15 years ago, this vulture has little experience of deploying the things. Without custom config, the WinApps config for both Docker and Podman defaults to storing the Windows VM in /var/lib – much as we noted of the Debian FreedomBox blend earlier this year. That means you need a big Linux root partition: the docs suggest a minimum size of 32 GB for the Windows system disk, and 64 GB is more prudent. The entire root volume on our testbed machine is only 64 gig, so we didn't have room for this approach.\n\nThe Reg FOSS desk is more familiar with KVM and its GUI front end, Virtual Machine Manager. As we've used it before – ironically, mostly for running experimental Kubernetes clusters – we decided to try that instead. The WinApps documentation is very good, too. We used virt-manager to set up a 64 GB VM with 8 GB of RAM and two CPU cores, running Windows 10 IoT LTSC.\n\nWe followed the steps to set up host/VM integration. We recommend following this carefully and closely – at several points, it is not enough to just accept the default settings. We had to download and edit scripts in places, entering the correct local IP address so the scripts could find the VM and so on. You'll also need to know your way around Windows: you need to configure it, activate it, and so on. Helpfully, the docs tell you how to bypass Windows 11's burning need to talk to the mothership, so you can configure an offline account. At least that's less of an issue with Win10 LTSC.\n\nNormally, you leave the Windows VM hidden and not logged in (which itself saves some memory in the VM, of course). When you open a Windows program, WinApps starts the VM if necessary, connects to it using the Linux FreeRDP client, and the app opens in its own window on your Linux desktop.\n\nSetup is a long and complex process, though. It took us more than a day to get everything working. The final stage of setup integrates the apps in your new Windows VM into the Linux desktop's app launcher, which left us with several superfluous icons for things like Microsoft Paint. Doing it at this point feels premature to us – it means that any apps you install in your new VM don't get picked up.\n\nSome of the steps require you to log out and log back in again to take effect. For an easy life, we treated it like many Windows installations: just reboot.\n\nWinBoat running MS System Information and some very misleading specs, all on the Ubuntu Noble desktop - click to enlarge\n\nNext, on a different machine, we tried the much newer WinBoat application. WinBoat is only about six months old and is only up to version 0.9.0 so far, and it's implemented mostly in Typescript with a little bit of Go. It's attracting attention, though – The Register's own Rupert Goodwins mentioned it just last month.\n\nThe project FAQ section covers many of the differences. The first question is How does it compare to WinApps? To which it says:\n\nWith WinApps you do the bulk of the setup manually, and there's no cohesive interface to bring it all together. There's a basic TUI, a taskbar widget, and some CLI commands for you to play with.\n\nWinBoat does all the setup once you have the pre-requisites installed, displays everything worth seeing in a neat interface for you, and acts like a complete experience. There's no need to mess with configuration files, no need to memorize a dozen CLI commands, it just works.\n\nTo be honest, when we first read this last year, our response was dismissive – but after getting WinApps working, suddenly this seems like a good and desirable objective.\n\nThe WinBoat configuration tab has 13 or so options you can adjust, which is a lot easier than editing config files - click to enlarge\n\nWinBoat offers few choices. It uses Docker (although v0.9.0 offers Podman as an option, with the drawback that USB passthrough no longer works). It doesn't ask you to configure Docker, either: all you need is to install it, for which it points to Docker's own instructions. You also need to install FreeRDP. The installation program links to FreeRDP's own docs again, although we just installed the standard X11 version in Ubuntu Noble's repositories and it worked fine.\n\nWinBoat is available in various formats, including AppImage, native .deb and .rpm packages, and even a Nix version. For now, though, there's no repository, updates are your own lookout – so we chose the AppImage. On Ubuntu 24.04.4, this threw the same error message as our preferred Panwriter app, so we just recalled this command from our history:\n\nThe Appimage doesn't include any external dependencies – it just halts and warns you if they're missing. We installed Docker, rebooted, and tried again… then installed FreeRDP3 and rebooted… and it ran straight through. It can download a Windows evaluation .iso file for you, but we pointed at our local LTSC edition and it used it happily. It shows a link to open the Windows VM's screen in a browser tab, which you might need to activate and update Windows – but almost everything else is done for you. Let it chug away for half an hour to an hour.\n\nThe WinBoat apps screen lists all the programs it can identify in your VM: simple, but effective - click to enlarge\n\nWinBoat also avoids fancy integration with the Linux desktop: the main app window shows the status of the Windows VM with large friendly buttons to pause and stop it, and a list of apps it found inside the VM. Click an app, wait a few seconds, and there it is, running in a window on your Linux desktop.\n\nThere is no simple answer to which is the better tool. WinBoat is much easier to get working, and it does the same job with little mess or fuss.\n\nLike many power-user Linux programs, WinApps isn't too intimidating if you're happy to edit config files – especially if you're comfortable and familiar with Docker or Podman. Saying that, using it with KVM/VMM definitely has advantages. For instance, it allows you to tweak KVM memory ballooning. This feature enables the hypervisor to reclaim unused RAM from the VM so the host can use it. Our WinApps testbed machine has 24 GB of RAM, and we gave the VM 4 GB but allowed it to balloon up to 8 GB.\n\nAnother benefit is that virt-manager can connect to a remote machine and manage its VMs as easily as local ones, which means you could, for instance, take an old box that doesn't have a TPM 2 chip for Windows 11, configure a minimal text-only Linux setup on it. Then using VMM on your desktop, create a Windows guest instance with a fake virtual TPM, install Windows 11 in that, and allocate all but a gig or so of the machine's RAM to that VM. You could also pass a real physical GPU through to the VM.\n\nIf you have a very high-end PC and a big Linux root partition, you might not care about this. On the other hand, WinBoat offers a simple dialog box that asks where to save the container with the Windows VM inside – so we were able to put it in our home directory, on a separate disk partition, with no problem.\n\nAt the end of the day, they both work and do the job. Although setup is lower-tech, WinApps has better integration, on both the Windows side and the host desktop. For instance, WinApps offers a little status-bar applet, which lets you start and stop the VM, pick apps from a list, and open a desktop session. In both, you can connect a Windows network drive to your Linux home directory, making file exhange easy. In WinApps, it's \\\\tsclient\\home, and in WinBoat it's \\\\host\\lan. Either way, map a network drive and it's right there in a couple of clicks.\n\nIf you're an experienced Linux techie, WinApps can do fancy stuff. This vulture is pretty experienced, and even so, its setup process had us swearing at several points. On the other hand, WinBoat makes almost all that just go away. To quote the late great John Brunner:\n\nIt's supposed to be automatic but actually you have to press this button.\n\nThat button conceals a lot of black magic, but it hides the plumbing very well and it works.\n\nPerhaps the best comparison is with the Windows Subsystem for Linux. WSL2 runs a Linux VM under Windows, integrated with the host OS; WinApps and WinBoat run a Windows VM under Linux, integrated with the host OS. If you are content and productive on your Linux desktop, but you constantly need certain specific Windows desktop apps and they don't work fully under WINE, this is easier and better-integrated than firing up a Windows VM in a window. Both tools can run Windows software that still doesn't work fully under WINE, such as current Microsoft and Adobe suites.\n\nThe downside, though, is that you are still running a full extra OS. You'll need to license it, it needs antivirus, and like any other copy of Windows it will need regular maintenance. Also, your computer's resources must be shared between both OSes. If you use this all day every day, you'll want lots of RAM, lots of fast disk space, and a fast machine. We tried two of our testbeds: an elderly (if well-specced) Thinkpad W520 with Ubuntu Questing, and a rather faster Dell Latitude 5420 with Ubuntu Noble. Windows apps were slow to launch on the Thinkpad; the whole process felt much smoother on the newer machine, but it still wasn't super-quick. On both, we saw display glitches when using two screens.\n\nIf your apps work, WINE is faster: apps launch quicker, integrate better, and because no copy of Windows is involved, there's no ongoing maintenance – and no license. The WinApps approach is strictly for desktop apps, and ideally, ones which don't want a fancy GPU or other dedicated local hardware. WINE and supplementary tools like Proton are better if what you want to run are Windows games. Most full-screen games won't work well in a VM.\n\nWinApps and WinBoat beat WINE on compatibility, though. If you need the Windows Store, or current Microsoft or Adobe programs, this is a great way to run them on your Linux desktop. And of course, both WinApps and WinBoat are free and open source. ®",

    "description": "In this post, we discuss how the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant decline in the amount of IPv4 address space announced by Ukrainian Autonomous Systems (ASes), and why those addresses are often now being announced by western ISPs and major public clouds.",
    "fullText": "In this post, we discuss how the ongoing war in Ukraine has led to a significant decline in the amount of IPv4 address space announced by Ukrainian Autonomous Systems (ASes), and why those addresses are often now being announced by western ISPs and major public clouds.\n\nThe internet of Ukraine, noted for its resilience in the initial months following the Russian invasion, has been profoundly affected by three years of war. One notable change has been the exodus of a vital national commodity: IPv4 addresses.\n\nIn this blog post, we highlight several cases in which large amounts of IPv4 space, formerly originated by prominent Ukrainian ASes, have moved out of the country (often with the help of IPv4 brokers) to dozens of new origins, including major cloud providers, hosting operations, and international telecoms. The result is a dramatic reduction in Ukraine’s footprint in the global routing table — a new consequence of a protracted war in the digital age.\n\nUsing the top 100 retail providers in Ukraine listed in Kentik Market Intelligence, we observed an 18.5% decline in the amount of announced IPv4 space between February 2022 and May 2025.\n\nBut before we get into the various examples of Ukrainian providers leasing out their IPv4 resources around the world, we should mention up front that there are many providers that have not participated in this practice and are originating exactly the same (or very nearly the same) routes as they did before the Russian invasion in 2022.\n\nThe top Ukrainian providers that did not change are listed below, ranked in descending order by the equivalent number of /24s of IPv4 they originated in February 2022:\n\nUkrtelecom (Укртелеком) is the incumbent telecommunications company of Ukraine and is represented in the global routing table by the ASNs 6849 and 6877. In the past three years, the amount of IPv4 address space announced by these ASes has dropped dramatically, with much of the lost IP space migrating out of the country, if not the region entirely.\n\nAS6849 is the primary ASN for Ukrtelecom, which has experienced a marked decline in the amount of IPv4 space it originates in the past three years. AS6849 went from originating the equivalent of 4,728 /24s to only 1377 — a decline of 71%.\n\nWhile much of the decline in originated address space is no longer routed at all, a significant portion of the decline is now originated by various companies outside of Eastern Europe. In fact, there are currently over 100 ASNs that originate IPv4 space announced by AS6849 three years ago.\n\nWho is announcing Ukrtelecom IPv4 space? 92 /24s of IPv4 space are now originated by AS174 (example 91.124.96.0/22), 77 /24s are announced by AS16509 (ex: 91.124.133.0/24) and even AT&T (AS7018, example 91.124.2.0/24) announces 29 /24s. Below is a screenshot from the bgp.tools web utility showing the address range originated by AS7018 and registered to Ukrtelecom. Even passive DNS for this prefix echoes a previous life with the Ukrainian incumbent.\n\nIf we do a whois on this range, we can see that it is currently registered as “ATT-CT.” The highlighted fields indicate that IPv4 broker IPXO (AS834) had a hand in leasing this IPv4 space to a new customer, who is now getting the route originated by AS7018.\n\nPictured below, Ukrtelecom’s sister ASN (6877) experienced an even more dramatic decline over the past three years. On Feb 1, 2022, AS6877 originated 38 prefixes equivalent to 616 /24s of IPv4 space. Now, AS6877 has all but disappeared from the global routing table (except as the contents of an AS-SET for a couple of prefixes).\n\nIn November 2024, this IPv4 space began getting originated by numerous ASes outside of Ukraine. At present, there are over 50 unique origins for these IPv4 ranges including familiar ASNs like 7018 (ex: 46.203.225.0/24), 3356 (ex: 46.203.68.0/22), 174 (ex: 46.203.81.0/24), 5511 (ex: 46.203.86.0/24), 6461 (ex: 46.202.84.0/24), 3257 (ex: 46.202.56.0/24), and 7029 (ex: 46.203.6.0/24).\n\nIn response to an inquiry about the leasing of IPv4 space, a representative of Ukrtelecom confirmed to me that this was an action taken to raise funds during an ongoing war.\n\nYes, this was a necessary step taken during wartime to secure financial stability and continue delivering essential services to our customers.\n\nLeasing out a portion of our IPv4 resources allowed us to mitigate some of the extraordinary challenges we have been facing since the full-scale invasion began.\n\nAt the same time, Ukrtelecom remains committed to maintaining and expanding internet infrastructure across Ukraine, especially through fiber rollout, which remains our strategic priority.\n\nWe appreciate the attention to this issue and are open to further dialogue on how Ukrainian telecoms are adapting in these unprecedented times.\n\nOlena Shramko\n\nPR Director\n\nUkrtelecom\n\nAccording to published rates from IPv4 brokers, a /24 (256 addresses) can be leased for $100–$150 per month. Based on the analysis above, Ukrtelecom is leasing the equivalent of 1500 /24’s (~1000 from former AS6849 IPv4 space and another ~500 from AS6877). If we assumed the low end of that price range, that would be US$150,000 (or ₴6,288,00) of additional revenue per month for the country’s national operator.\n\nIn another example, AS43310 began 2022 originating 3 prefixes equivalent to 24 /24s of IPv4: 91.225.224.0/22, 91.197.4.0/22, and 188.191.96.0/20. By November 2022, things had begun to change as this address space began to be parceled out to over a dozen new origins, with AS7018 currently the primary origin for these former Ukrainian IPv4 ranges.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, AS34092 was originating 6 IPv4 prefixes equivalent to 58 /24s of IP space until the beginning of March that year, when it disappeared from the routing table. Some routes were shifted to sister AS, 57033, but by June 2022, the address space was being farmed out to numerous ASes.\n\nAS57033, for its part, began 2022 by announcing 21 IPv4 prefixes equivalent to 48 /24s of IP space (some overlapping with AS34092). But by December 2024, AS57033 disappeared as well and now all of IPv4 space originated by these two ASNs in 2022 is now originated by 37 ASNs including AS8075 (ex: 81.22.128.0/24), AS7018 (ex: 81.22.129.0/24), AS3320 (ex: 109.72.116.0/24), and AS16509 (ex: 31.43.161.0/24).\n\nIn my blog post from February 2023 about the Russification of IP registrations, I highlighted a route (151.0.0.0/20) originated by AS45025, which had its country field updated from “UA” to “RU” in July of 2022 as part of a larger effort to assimilate newly Russian-held territories.\n\nIn fact, the RIPE database has been altered as well. Below is the output of a whois command I ran in 2023 that was featured in the blog post.\n\nIf you were to run the same command today, you would get a message saying that the object was deleted on April 4, 2024. The evidence of the prior existence as a prefix of Ukraine has been purged from the records.\n\nWell, AS45025 no longer exists in the global routing table. The IPv4 space it was originating in 2022 has been divvied up among providers in the Russian-held region of Donetsk, as well as a few global telecoms such as AS7018 (ex: 93.89.216.0/24), AS5511 (ex: 91.193.252.0/24), and AS2914 (ex: 93.89.218.0/24).\n\nDepicted below, AS42430 was a service provider based in the Lugansk region of Ukraine, along the front lines of battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The ASN disappeared from the global routing table in March 2022, and with it, the seven prefixes equivalent to 37 /24s of IPv4. In September 2022, parts of these ranges began to be originated by new origins, including Bursabil Teknoloji (AS60721), a Turkish IPv4 broker.\n\nIn 2023, IPv4 broker IPXO, and US telecom icons Sprint and AT&T were among the origins for the former Lugansk IPv4 space. Still, the primary origin that emerged for these IPs was Paltel (AS12975) of the Palestinian Territories, which currently originates nearly all of it. According to RIPE NCC’s published transfer statistics, 188.0.112.0/20 and 188.0.96.0/20 were transferred from Byte-SD to Paltel on January 6, 2023.\n\nAS43554 was a service provider operating in Mariupol, originating the equivalent of 259 /24s of IPv4 at the beginning of 2022. Trinity went offline in early March of 2022 during the bloody siege of the city.\n\nJust like with the previous example, IPv4 space previously originated by AS43554 started to be originated by as many as 54 ASes outside of Ukraine. This phenomenon continued until the beginning of 2024, when a large portion of the address space was consolidated into Ukrainian content provider Sweet (AS204384).\n\nDuring the summer of 2023, I noticed some of Trinity’s IPv4 space being originated by AT&T (screenshot below).\n\nIn fact, one of the address ranges had been registered as “AT&T Services, Inc.” in a likely attempt to use it for a residential proxy.\n\nCyberintelligence firm Spur summarizes the problems posed by proxy services this way:\n\nResidential proxies have long been used for illicit activity on the internet, including web scraping, scalping tickets to your favorite concerts, pushing spam to forums and social media, new account fraud and account takeovers. It involves hijacking what otherwise is legitimate infrastructure, allowing bad actors to mask their actual IP addresses with those associated with genuine customers your business would otherwise welcome.\n\n“Residential proxies” are so named because they utilize IP addresses that an Internet Service Provider has assigned to a household, as opposed to a business or datacenter. This makes them appear more legitimate and allows them to evade detection by legacy geolocation and fraud services or IP quality score providers like MaxMind or Transunion (formerly Neustar).\n\nI brought this to a contact at AT&T and within a few weeks it was gone.\n\nAlso based in Mariupol, AS24881 was originating six prefixes equivalent to 76 /24s of IPv4 back in 2022. As illustrated below, AS24881 and the IPv4 space it originated disappeared from the global routing table in March of that year.\n\nAS24881’s IPv4 space wouldn’t be seen again until February 2023 when it was originated by Linknet (AS57460), a service provider based in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in the Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast. During 2023, this address space was originated by as many as 20 different origins, as is illustrated below.\n\nIn May 2022, Russian forces rerouted internet service to the occupied southern city of Kherson through Miranda-Media (AS201776) in Russian-occupied Crimea. I detailed the switchover in a blog post and in a collaboration with The New York Times that landed on the front page of the newspaper.\n\nThe first provider in Kherson to make the switch to Russian transit was SkyNet (aka KhersonTelecom, AS47598), whose owner took to Facebook to explain his rationale for reconnecting his service through Russia. “On April 30, EVERYTHING fell!” he said, adding that he had no choice but to “turn on the circuit of the Crimean operator Miranda.” While some local residents thanked him, others accused him of using “enemy internet”, a decision he defended in the post.\n\nIn November 2022, Ukrainian forces retook Kherson Oblast above the Dnieper River, and most providers switched back to using Ukrainian transit to connect to the global internet. It was at that time that AS47598 disappeared from the global routing table. In April 2024, the one prefix (91.206.110.0/23) that had been originated by AS47598 in 2022 reappeared as originated by NTT (AS2914), where it continues to be announced today.\n\nIn April 2025, KhersonTelecom transferred its three IPv4 ranges (including 91.206.110.0/23) to a new owner. All three are hosting proxy services according to cyberintelligence firm Spur.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, I published the first analysis of the emerging private market for IPv4. The analysis was the basis for our talk at RIPE 70 in Amsterdam that year. Following years of debate on the matter, the RIPE NCC created a process for facilitating the sale of IPv4 space, creating a new player in the internet ecosystem: the IPv4 broker.\n\nOne of the first IPv4 brokers to emerge was a Romanian outfit so prolific that roughly half of the transfers recorded by RIPE that year were from that country alone. In fact, the footprint of the Romanian internet in the global routing table shrank by a quarter in 2015 as every bit of the country’s IPv4 space that wasn’t being actively used was sold off — mainly to Saudi Arabia and Iran, which was the subject of my collaboration with the Washington Post later that year.\n\nSomething similar has been happening to Ukraine’s footprint in the global routing table, but for different reasons. Weary from years of missile strikes and aerial bombardment, conditions are tough in many parts of the country. If leasing out parts of their IP resources keeps the business afloat and employees paid, who can blame these providers?\n\nBut questions arise. Are IPv4 brokers taking advantage of the situation by leasing out so much of Ukraine’s IPv4 space? Or are the brokers vital “to secure financial stability” for Ukrainian ISPs? Who is responsible when these ranges are used for various proxy services that cause problems on the internet?\n\nAt APRICOT in 2024, APNIC Chief Scientist Geoff Huston asked whether we have reached peak IPv4, citing a recent decline in the amount of routed IPv4. In another talk (slide 6), he cited the decline in the market price for IPv4, theorizing that perhaps demand was waning as IPv6 was utilized more (or NAT was becoming more acceptable). But another reason could be that the market is being flooded with supply from Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "Former Ireland scrum-half Conor Murray believes Jack Crowley should start Ireland's Six Nations trip to face England at Twickenham next Saturday (14:10 GMT).\n\nAfter his introduction in the 56th minute in Saturday's 20-13 win over Italy, Crowley converted Rob Baloucoune's try and added a crucial penalty later in the game.\n\nSam Prendergast, who who formed a starting half-back pairing with Craig Casey, was off target with two conversions and Murray feels head coach Andy Farrell may seek a change in that area, with Crowley and Jamison Gibson-Park a viable option against England.\n\n\"I think you do, don't you?\" Murray told the Ireland Rugby Social podcast.\n\n\"I think Crowley starts the next game because he did so well when he came on.\n\n\"I don't think Jack's stats are where he has had them before, but he came on and kicked two kicks. I know one of them was very easy and you could argue that Sam's [Prendergast] kicks were gettable as well.\n\n\"We are going around a roundabout with this one and this is Jack's turn again. I am just hoping someone grabs it [the chance]. \"\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nIreland survive Italy scare to claim first win\n\nFor the second week, Ireland have questions to answer despite claiming an opening win in the competition and former international Mike McCarthy admits it was a \"stressful finish\" in Dublin.\n\nThe 19-cap forward felt a huge cause for concern was the Ireland scrum which came under pressure from the Italians and is one area which requires work before the trip to face an England side who will also have a point to prove following their Calcutta Cup defeat by Scotland.\n\n\"Ireland just got over the edge at the end, but the last five or 10 minutes was incredibly tense and for me, the big concern going into next week's game against England is the scrum,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"Tadhg Furlong going up in the air, Dan Sheehan going up in the air and next week England will be licking their lips at scrum time.\n\n\"John Fogarty [Ireland scrum coach] will have a lot to do during the week but it was just the arrowhead of pressure coming from the Italian back five. Hopefully it's a one-off because they did well against France.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ireland centre Stuart McCloskey said there is \"more to come\" from fellow Ulster players Cormac Izuchukwu and man of the match Baloucoune.\n\nAfter a humbling 36-14 defeat by France in their opening fixture, Ireland bounced back to defeat a much-improved Italy side.\n\nJamie Osborne, Jack Conan and Six Nations debutant Baloucoune crossed the white line for Farrell's side, who thwarted a late flurry of chances to deny Italy a late leveller.\n\n\"He [Rob] is class and I think he has shown how good he has been when he has played this year. For Ulster, he has been world-class when he has been fit. You could say that about the last four or five years,\" McCloskey told the Ireland Rugby Social podcast.\n\n\"He is electric, he scores tries that other people can't and takes balls in the air that other people can't take.\n\n\"Rob and Izzy have so much X factor. I think they showed that today and there is more to come. It gives me energy when I am playing with those guys as well.\"",

    "fullText": "It will go down as one of the strangest FA Cup finals on record.\n\nArsenal's 2-1 win over Chelsea in 2020 was played at a near-deserted Wembley while the Gunners received the trophy on the pitch, instead of climbing the famous steps to the Royal Box for the presentation as is tradition.\n\nDespite fans being prevented from attending the domestic showpiece becaue of Covid, it was a day Matt Smith will never forget.\n\nAged 19 and without a competitive first-team appearance to his name, the boyhood Arsenal fan was named on the Gunners substitutes bench after Mesut Ozil was left out, external by Mikel Arteta.\n\nAfter the full-time whistle confirmed the first and - as of right now - only major trophy of Arteta's reign, Smith received a winners' medal and had his picture taken with fellow substitute Bukayo Saka on the pitch with the FA Cup.\n\nSix years on and Smith, who now plays in midfield for Wigan Athletic, returns to Emirates Stadium on Sunday when the League One strugglers face Premier League leaders Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup (16:30 GMT kick-off).\n\n\"It was mad really because it was when the whole thing surrounding Ozil was going on,\" Smith, 25, tells BBC Sport about his memories of the 2020 final.\n\n\"He wasn't in the squad so I was getting on the bench. I was on the bench for the quarter-final at Sheffield United, the semi-final with Manchester City and then the final.\n\n\"When you're that young you don't really understand the importance of being part of the FA Cup final or the memories it's going to give you for the rest of your life.\n\n\"It's only now I realise how grateful I was to be involved in something so special like that.\n\n\"I remember getting my suit for the final and it being way too big for me. I didn't want to say anything because I was young.\n\n\"All the other players' suits were tailored but mine was massive - they must have done it wrong.\n\n\"I didn't make it on to the pitch but that day will live with me forever.\"\n\nSmith grew up with posters of former Gunners captain Cesc Fabregas on his bedroom wall.\n\n\"My whole family are massive Arsenal fans,\" he says. \"When I was younger I used to watch a lot of Arsenal games with my dad - we went to most home games.\"\n\nAfter joining at the age of seven, Smith spent 15 years at Arsenal, going on to captain the under-18s while also appearing in the 2018 FA Youth Cup final with Saka.\n\n\"He was a year below me but he was so good that he would always play in a higher age group,\" Smith says of Arsenal's current number seven.\n\n\"When he got to 16 or 17 he overtook me.\"\n\nYet such was Smith's potential that he was invited to train with the first team as a 17-year-old, while his name appeared frequently on the team sheet as a substitute towards the end of 2019-20.\n\n\"I'd grown up watching these players on television and suddenly I found myself training with them.\"\n\nHe recalls the methods Arteta employed at pre-match team meetings to keep players engaged, including games of Pictionary - the game based on drawing - focusing on opposition players and tactics.\n\n\"It was very different to other team meetings,\" adds Smith, who had loan spells at Swindon Town, Charlton Athletic and Doncaster Rovers while at Arsenal.\n\n\"It would always be a game to get the energy and camaraderie up.\n\n\"It was all about getting our brains switched on, getting everyone communicating with one another.\n\n\"There were games of Pictionary relating to the opposition and everything you had learned throughout the week.\n\n\"Instead of it all being written down on a board and players just sitting there not really taking it in, he made it fun and different.\"\n\nSmith joined Wigan in 2023 after his Arsenal contract expired.\n\nDespite his disappointment at being released, he remembers his last conversation with Arteta and the advice the Spaniard gave him before wishing him luck with his career.\n\n\"He told me that throughout my career people are going to tell me what my weaknesses are and what I need to work on.\n\n\"But he also said 'make your strengths your super-strengths, whenever you get on the pitch do what you're good at and make that your thing'.\n\n\"That's something that has stuck with me.\"\n\nSmith adds: \"He's such a good manager. He used to tell me stuff that I'd never heard before that made me see the game in a different way.\n\n\"It's only a matter of time before Arsenal start winning trophies regularly.\n\n\"They've been close the last couple of seasons but haven't been able to get over the line. They've now got the squad to do it. They are one of the best sides in Europe right now.\"\n\nSmith's parents, Gerrard and Kate, were unable to attend Wembley in 2020 because of Covid restrictions but they will be at Emirates Stadium to watch their son against his former club on Sunday.\n\nHis sister, Amy, will be there too.\n\nWith Wigan selling all of their 5,000 tickets, it will be the first time he has played in front of a 60,000 full house.\n\n\"I've not been back to Arsenal since leaving three years ago,\" says Smith, who is looking forward to catching up with some familiar faces, including Gunners captain Martin Odegaard.\n\nOn Smith's final day with the Gunners, Odegaard presented him with one of his armbands and an Arsenal shirt signed by all the players.\n\n\"That was a really nice gesture,\" adds Smith.\n\n\"He's a good captain to be fair. He's not the loudest but he leads by example and has played at the highest level.\"\n\nSo, what happened to his FA Cup winners' medal?\n\n\"It's at my mum and dad's house.\"\n\nDoes Smith look at it regularly?\n\n\"Not at all. I think the last time I saw it was two years ago. I'll have plenty of time to look at it when I retire. Hopefully, I've got a few more years before I pack in playing.\"",

    "title": "Is Zubimendi Arsenal's best player?",
    "description": "After an impressive start to his Arsenal career, BBC Sport looks at whether Martin Zubimendi is the Gunners' most important player.",
    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta recently hinted that Arsenal's \"best player\" is somebody who has only been with the club a matter of months - summer signing Martin Zubimendi.\n\nIt may have gone unnoticed at the time but, speaking after the Gunners' tight 1-0 win over Crystal Palace in October, manager Arteta lavished praise on the £60m midfield man - saying Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta had been tasked with defending Arsenal's \"best player\".\n\nIt is for good reason that Arteta rates one of his more recent signings so highly. Zubimendi has been justifying his manager's comments since signing from boyhood club Real Sociedad in July 2025.\n\nThe 27-year-old has played the most minutes of any of Arsenal's outfield players and has been chipping in with goals too.\n\nAnd that goal return may have come as a surprise, with Zubimendi signed primarily as a defensive midfielder but now having scored six times in 34 appearances - the most he has registered during any campaign in his career.\n\nArsenal and Arteta made a big play to recruit Zubimendi and started the work to try to sign him 12 months before he arrived at the club, initially discussing the possibility when they were completing a deal for his Sociedad team-mate Mikel Merino in the summer of 2024.\n\nZubimendi was brought in to be a crucial component of the Arsenal squad, with his passing ability, on-pitch intelligence and history of winning important trophies.\n\nIndeed, the Spain international played an important role in his country beating England in the Euro 2024 final.\n\nHis signing has also given midfield team-mate Declan Rice the licence to take his attacking game to the next level.\n\nArteta has spoken previously about how chaos and attacking more directly were effective ways for Arsenal to create chances when Zubimendi's influence was blunted by being man-marked.\n\nAnd from this we can infer that Zubimendi - Arsenal's \"best player\" - is most important when it comes to breaking down teams in the manner Arteta prefers, with measured, sustained possession.\n\nZubimendi was pursued by Liverpool in 2024 and Reds boss Arne Slot made no secret of his desire for a defensive midfielder who is able to receive the ball behind strikers pressing his defenders, rather than coming to get the ball. Zubimendi excels at this.\n\nAnd the former Sociedad man's ability to sprint at the right time in order to show for the ball before progressing play - whether through a first-time pass, a timely dribble or a punchy pass through the line - has elevated Arsenal's build-up this season.\n\nMeanwhile, aerially, Zubimendi directs headers with a level of finesse, finding team-mates rather than simply looking to head the ball away.\n\nBuild-up play and the ability to break up attacks is to be expected of a £60m defensive midfielder but the way Arteta has used Zubimendi as an attacking tool has stood out, suggesting this is an area where marginal gains can be found in football going forward.\n\nZubimendi, Rice and Martin Odegaard's positions on paper may seem obvious but they show flexibility, built upon the versatility of all three players and their understanding of when to move - similar to the Paris St-Germain midfield that won the Champions League last season.\n\nArsenal's players rotate positions to make it difficult for opponents to pick them up. They aim to maintain the balance of the side while playing in this fluid manner. Zubimendi, like the others, vacates his position based on the movements of team-mates.\n\nIt is unusual to see a defensive midfielder make such adventurous runs off the ball but it appears to be the next step on from the more popular use of roaming full-backs, such as Riccardo Calafiori, Nuno Mendes and Marc Cucurella.\n\nThe logic is that the players often tasked with marking defensive players are unlikely to defend them as closely. Finding defensive players who possess attacking quality to contribute in the final third is a rarity but Zubimendi has the skillset to punish teams in this way.\n\nDefences set up in a low block will often drop even deeper when faced with a winger or forward trying to run in-behind. It leads to space opening up in front of the defence, rather than in the box.\n\nArsenal spend large parts of the game looking to unlock deep defences. This allows Zubimendi to arrive into a position to receive a pass, without being picked up, before executing on the idea he has in his head immediately. This could be a precise through ball or a dinked chip over the top - riskier passes that pose new questions for deep defences.\n\nAlternatively, when Zubimendi sits at the base of midfield, Rice is free to push up and rotate with the attackers, knowing there is protection behind him.\n\nAnd the England man will likely feel safe to play freely after seeing his 5ft 9in team-mate beat 6ft 6in Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade to a header earlier this season.\n\nMeanwhile, Zubimendi's willingness to shoot from distance provided Arsenal with the much-needed opening goal against Nottingham Forest and Sunderland, after which more space opened up for the Gunners with their opposition forced to play more adventurously.\n\nArteta said \"if the space is not in one place, it will be somewhere else\" - and against deep defences, long shots have become an increasingly viable tactic this season.\n\nSigning Zubimendi, therefore, could not have been more timely.\n\nArteta has never been shy in praising Zubimendi.\n\nThe midfielder's six goals this season also match the tally he scored for Real Sociedad in his last two seasons at the club (six goals in 93 games).\n\nZubimendi got the opening goals against Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Sunderland, while he also scored Arsenal's third in the 3-2 win over Chelsea in their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg.\n\n\"I think when we talk about Zubi, what else can he do? He can do whatever he wants. It's a bit similar to Declan's qualities,\" Arteta said, speaking after that match.\n\n\"We just have to keep unlocking that in his system, in his brain, because he's so good at occupying different spaces, he's carrying the ball, dribbling, winning duels, and he has a talent when he gets into the final third and into the box. He's so composed. He sees the picture very clear.\n\n\"The picture actually is clear sometimes that I know the parts of the pitch and what he's done today. I think it's phenomenal, not only the ball but the performance as well.\"\n\nThe midfielder is tasked with stopping opponents' attacks and starting Arsenal's, and with the final part of the season approaching and trophies on the line, he could be more important than ever.\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Tom Banton's 63 not out against Scotland was his breakout innings for England and he says it was down to his increased maturity.",
    "fullText": "Tom Banton thinks he is older, wiser and, quite simply, better these days.\n\nIt is coming up to seven years since the England batter first caught the eye as a 19-year-old by hitting a stunning 71 from 37 balls to help Somerset chase 204 against Surrey in the T20 Blast.\n\nIf the pure numbers from that day were not enough, one reverse flick for six off Sam Curran - now an England team-mate - made some smart judges take note.\n\nThe following winter Banton was picked by England for their tour of New Zealand.\n\nHe kept his place the next summer, in Twenty20 and 50-over cricket, picked as the fresh face to help take the 2019 World Cup winners on into a new era.\n\nBanton made 58 against Ireland and 71 in a T20 against Pakistan, but they were his only scores above 50 in 15 matches.\n\nAnother five caps came and went in 2022, making this current run the 27-year-old's third go at international level.\n\nHis match-winning 63 not out in England's five-wicket win against Scotland on Saturday, with his side's T20 World Cup hopes on the line, may not have been his highest score, but it was his best knock for his country - a breakout innings in which he finally delivered on all of those talents by truly defining a match on the biggest stage.\n\n\"I think just a bit, obviously older, more mature, got a better understanding of my game,\" Banton said, asked what he is doing differently this time.\n\n\"When I came onto the scene, I remember at the start of that summer I was just about scraping into Somerset's second team.\n\n\"Then six months later, I was playing for England and traveling all over the world, which was great, but I've got more of an understanding.\n\n\"I have kind of, I don't know, just grown. I've learned a lot about myself. Not even anything to do with cricket.\"\n\n'England have no chance at T20 World Cup if they do not improve'\n\nEngland edge to victory to leave Scotland on brink\n\nBanton's recall came at the start of last year with this World Cup in mind.\n\nDespite largely playing as an opener for his county and in The Hundred, he was picked by England to bat in the middle order because of his ability to attack spin - the style of bowling which dominates the middle overs of T20 internationals at the venues of World Cup co-hosts India and Sri Lanka.\n\nAt that time, only India's Abhishek Sharma, the number one-ranked batter in the world, was scoring faster against spinners than Banton. Banton's average of 44.1 against slow bowling was the best of any English batter.\n\nScoring 54 not out to secure a T20 series win in Sri Lanka before this tournament hinted at what was to come. The Scotland innings was a bright spark amid the uncertainty around how good England actually are.\n\n\"It's [batting at number four] is different, I won't lie,\" he said.\n\n\"You come in probably against spin, or towards the end of the powerplay, depending how we go.\n\n\"The biggest one is like adapting to the scenario or the wicket.\n\n\"I found Wankhede [the Mumbai stadium, venue for England's win over Nepal and defeat by West Indies] a bit hard.\n\n\"Today [Saturday], I feel like it was a pretty good wicket.\"\n\nBanton is disarmingly human - a welcome trait within the current set-up.\n\nHe was one of those most guilty of what captain Harry Brook's described as being \"too careful\" against West Indies, having been out tentatively chipping a catch.\n\nHe speaks openly and will admit his doubts, which were there with that innings following another low score against Nepal.\n\n\"As any human would do, there's obviously those doubts but I think Baz [coach Brendon McCullum], Brooky, the coaches and everyone in the team backs everyone.\n\n\"It's T20 cricket, people are going to go up and down, that's just how T20 cricket is sometimes.\n\n\"You've just got to keep backing yourself, keep training hard, keep working hard on your game and luckily it came off for me today.\"\n\nBut against Scotland, Banton's innings perfectly encapsulated his growing maturity. His first nine deliveries were all from pace bowlers, and he scored only five runs.\n\nWhen facing spin for the first time, he took one single and then hit his first boundary from the next delivery.\n\nWhen Scotland's left-arm spinner Mark Watt entered the attack, Banton hit the first two balls for sixes over long-off and the fourth over mid-wicket.\n\nIt was a batter clearly playing to his strengths, even if he insists it was not premeditated.\n\n\"It's just reading the game and adapting - that's the biggest word at the moment in our changing room,\" he said.\n\n\"On a flat wicket, we're one of the best teams in the world but if we want to win the World Cup, especially if we're going to Sri Lanka, you're only going to have to adapt.\n\n\"Sometimes it's just about winning and winning ugly.\"\n\nIn total, Banton took 28 runs from 10 balls delivered by Watt. He eased 35 from 31 deliveries bowled by the rest of Scotland's attack.\n\nAcross the match six dismissals when batters were attempting sweeps across the match - the bounce of the Kolkata pitch bringing danger.\n\nRather than following suit, Banton put away his trademark shot - he tried it once to Watt early on, but never again - and instead targeted straight boundaries.\n\n\"Everyone sets up the field [square to defend Banton's sweeps] straight away now and on a wicket like that it was probably perfect, because I wasn't even trying,\" he said.\n\n\"That wasn't even in my mind to try and hit it there.\n\n\"You've got to keep evolving as about and keep learning and keep trying to hit it in different areas.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses the potential long-term impact of England's defeat by Scotland at Murrayfield, and the challenge of facing Ireland at Allianz Stadium on Saturday.\n\nI can easily reel off the losses that stuck with me in the Six Nations, as they can take you to a really dark place at times.\n\nScotland 2000, Ireland 2001 and France 2002 - they all still hurt.\n\nI was involved in all those campaigns and came up short of a Grand Slam by one victory three consecutive times.\n\nIt is important now to take stock and remember that defeat will happen again at some point before the 2027 Rugby World Cup.\n\nEngland will lick their wounds after yet another crushing defeat by Scotland, but even if a potential Grand Slam has gone, they still have a championship to play for.\n\nThe chance to win a Grand Slam does not come around very often, and that is the reality.\n\nLast week I said it would be foolish to draw a straight line from the opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider in Paris.\n\nThis tournament is magical for exactly that reason.\n\nTwo wins and England will be in a position to go to Paris and perhaps try to win the championship.\n\nThere is plenty to focus on and be excited about, and that Murrayfield pain will make England a better team.\n\nBig away wins are not easy in the Six Nations, and Saturday is another one that eluded Steve Borthwick.\n\nIt is not just about winning on another pitch as the World Cup is on neutral soil in Australia.\n\nIt is about the different feeling outside the Twickenham environment and home comforts.\n\nAs impressive as the 12-game winning run was, England still need that South African mentality - wherever you go in the world, you are expected to win and be globally successful.\n\nBorthwick is still yet to travel to Scotland, Ireland or France in the Six Nations and win.\n\nMost adversity comes from playing away from home, and Saturday gave the England players more of those scenarios.\n\nIt is very unlikely they will win a World Cup without a statement away victory beforehand.\n\nThere is a lot happening in these high-pressure games, and for high-paced players it is happening more quickly both physically and mentally.\n\nUnfortunately for Henry Arundell, who was being ultra-competitive, you have to read situations like the one when he took out Kyle Steyn in the air.\n\nEngland found themselves in a position where they were not playing well and were losing the scraps.\n\nIn those situations, you need clarity as well as competitiveness, and a red card obviously does not help to swing the momentum back.\n\nThat decision has cost England dearly and, given how competitive that wing slot is, I am sure Borthwick is going to have to manage that scenario.\n\nHenry is a 23-year-old and will, of course, bounce back, but it was reckless and a poor decision.\n\nWhat if that had been a championship decider or a World Cup knockout game?\n\nYou have to make good decisions under pressure. Being in those situations more often will help players learn.\n\nSix Nations: Scotland regain the Calcutta Cup\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nBewildering, bewitching, brilliant - Scotland's perfect day\n\nEngland will be licking their lips at the opportunity to bounce back against Ireland on Saturday.\n\nWe know England can perform with the comfort of home support, so it is not about putting things right - that will come in games in Rome and Paris.\n\nIt is about building on what they did prior to the Scotland game. Sometimes you have to park a game, write it off and move on.\n\nI thought I had seen England drift away from the kick-heavy style and strategy.\n\nScotland put on an attacking masterclass, whereas when England did attack it felt like they were punching for their lives but not actually landing anything.\n\nThey lacked shape, going left and right without making any progress - like a boxer on the ropes punching for their life but not actually hitting anything.\n\nGeorge Ford's failed drop-goal felt like a last-ditch option, which then resulted in what Borthwick described as a 10-point swing.\n\nI do not think you can blame Ford, the sequence was not set up properly and it felt like tired minds all over the place.\n\nDealing with a fast and furious game is, once again, a learning curve to take forward.\n\nTwo years ago there was plenty of talk that Ireland were going to beat England by 30 points at Twickenham.\n\nIt was such a mismatch in terms of where both sides were in their development.\n\nMarcus Smith's late drop-goal denied Ireland a potential Grand Slam, and that was a huge moment in Borthwick's tenure.\n\nNow England come in as favourites - it is amazing how quickly the landscape changes.\n\nHaving lost badly against France and nearly drawn against Italy, Ireland will be annoyed that everyone is writing them off.\n\nThey are a well-motivated team under Andy Farrell and are very well drilled.\n\nIreland will come out and probably play their best game of the campaign.\n\nScotland, in the space of a week, turned their disappointing loss in Rome into a convincing display against England.\n\nThat is how quickly things can change.\n\nDefeat next weekend and the pressure builds on England, with two difficult away fixtures to finish.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win",

    "description": "Combining GStreamer and Machine Learning frameworks are easy tools to create powerful video analytics pipelines.",
    "fullText": "Creating powerful video analytics pipelines is easy if you have the right tools. In this post, we will show you how to effortlessly build a broad range of machine learning (ML) enabled video pipelines using just two components, GStreamer and Python. We will focus on simplicity and functionality, deferring performance tuning to a future deep dive.\n\nThe core of our pipeline is GStreamer, everyone's favorite multimedia framework. Over the past few years, Collabora has contributed extensive ML capabilities to upstream GStreamer, adding support for ONNX and LiteRT inference and introducing a fine-grained, extensible metadata framework to persist model outputs.\n\nWe now take the next step by unleashing gst-python-ml: a pure Python framework that can easily build powerful ML-enabled GStreamer pipelines using standard Python packages. With just a few lines of Python, or a single gst-launch-1.0 command, you can now run complex models across multiple streams, complete with tracking, captioning, speech and text processing, and much more.\n\nThe framework is composed of a set of base classes that can be easily extended to create new ML elements, and a set of tested, fully functional elements that support the following features and models:\n\nFor a taste of the ease and simplicity of gst-python-ml, we present a few sports analytics sample pipelines.\n\n1. Here are all the steps needed to run a Yolo tracking pipeline on Ubuntu:\n\n2. Here is a soccer match processed with this pipeline:\n\n3. Multiple video sources are also supported.\n\n4. Another supported sports analytics feature is the creation of a bird's eye view of a game, to show a quick overview of the field:\n\n5. gst-python-ml shows its true power when using hybrid vision + language models to enable features that are simply not available in any other GStreamer-based analytics framework, whether open source or commercial. For example, video captioning is supported using the Phi3.5 Vision model. Each video frame can be automatically captioned, and these captions can be further processed to automatically summarize a game or to detect significant events such as goals.\n\nThese are just a few of the features we have built with gst-python-ml - the possibilities are endless.\n\ngst-python-ml is distributed as a PyPI package. All elements are first class GStreamer elements that can be added to any GStreamer pipeline, and they will work with any Linux distribution's GStreamer packages, from version 1.24 onward.\n\nDevelopment takes place on our GitHub repository — we welcome contributions, feedback and new ideas.\n\nAs we continue building gst-python-ml we are actively looking for collaborators and partners. Our goal is to make ML workflows in GStreamer powerful and accessible — whether for real-time media analysis, content generation, or for intelligent pipelines in production environments.\n\nIf you would like to know more about Collabora's work on GStreamer ML, please contact us.",

    "description": "A new variation of the fake recruiter campaign from North Korean threat actors is targeting JavaScript and Python developers with cryptocurrency-related tasks.",
    "fullText": "A new variation of the fake recruiter campaign from North Korean threat actors is targeting JavaScript and Python developers with cryptocurrency-related tasks.\n\nThe activity has been ongoing since at least May 2025 and is characterized by modularity, which allows the threat actor to quickly resume it in case of partial compromise.\n\nThe bad actor relies on packages published on the npm and PyPi registries that act as downloaders for a remote access trojan (RAT). In total, researchers found 192 malicious packages related to this campaign, which they dubbed 'Graphalgo'.\n\nResearchers at software supply-chain security company ReversingLabs say that the threat actor creates fake companies in the blockchain and crypto-trading sectors and publishes job offerings on various platforms, like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Reddit.\n\nDevelopers applying for the job are required to show their skills by running, debugging, and improving a given project. However, the attacker's purpose is to make the applicant run the code.\n\nThis action would cause a malicious dependency from a legitimate repository to be installed and executed.\n\n\"It is easy to create such job task repositories. Threat actors simply need to take a legitimate bare-bone project and fix it up with a malicious dependency and it is ready to be served to targets,\" the researchers say.\n\nTo hide the malicious nature of the dependencies, the hackers host the dependencies on legitimate platforms, like npm and PyPi.\n\nIn one case highlighted in the ReversingLabs report, a package named ‘bigmathutils,’ with 10,000 downloads, was benign until it reached version 1.1.0, which introduced malicious payloads. Shortly after, the threat actor removed the package, marking it as deprecated, likely to conceal the activity.\n\nThe Graphalgo name of the campaign is derived from packages that have “graph” in their name. They typically impersonate legitimate, popular libraries like graphlib, the researchers say.\n\nHowever, from December 2025 onward, the North Korean actor shifted to packages with “big” in their name. However, ReversingLabs has not discovered the recruiting part, or the campaign frontend, related to them.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the actor uses Github Organizations, which are shared accounts for collaboration across multiple projects. They say that the GitHub repositories are clean, and malicious code is introduced indirectly via dependencies hosted on npm and PyPI, which are the Graphalgo packages.\n\nVictims running the project as instructed in the interview infect their systems with these packages, which install a RAT payload on their machines.\n\nIt is worth noting that ReversingLabs researchers identified several developers that fell for the trick and contacted them \n\nThe RAT can list the running processes on the host, execute arbitrary commands per instructions from the command-and-control (C2) server, and exfiltrate files or drop additional payloads.\n\nThe RAT checks whether the MetaMask cryptocurrency extension is installed on the victim’s browser, a clear indication of its money-stealing goals.\n\nIts C2 communication is token-protected to lock out unauthorized observers, a common tactic for North Korean hackers.\n\nReversingLabs has found multiple variants written in JavaScript, Python, and VBS, showing an intention to cover all possible targets.\n\nThe researchers’ attribute the Graphalgo fake recruiter campaign to the Lazarus group with medium-to-high confidence. The conclusion is based on the approach, the use of coding tests as an infection vector, and the cryptocurrency-focused targeting, all of which aligning with previous activity associated with the North Korean threat actor.\n\nAlso, the researchers note the delayed activation of malicious code in the packages, consistent with Lazarus' patience displayed in other attacks. Finally, the Git commits show the GMT +9 time zone, matching North Korea time.\n\nThe complete indicators of compromise (IoCs) are available in the original report. Developers who installed the malicious packages at any point should rotate all tokens and account passwords and reinstall their OS.\n\nModern IT infrastructure moves faster than manual workflows can handle.\n\nIn this new Tines guide, learn how your team can reduce hidden manual delays, improve reliability through automated response, and build and scale intelligent workflows on top of tools you already use.",

    "description": "Yet another tantalizing clue.",
    "fullText": "Last year, NASA’s Curiosity rover made a fascinating discovery after boring into a suspected ancient lake bed on Mars: long-chain organic molecules, called alkanes, that could serve as a potential chemical relic of ancient life on the Red Planet.\n\nThe molecules, researchers suggested at the time, could have derived from fatty acids, which are common building blocks of cell membranes on Earth, once again strengthening the case that Mars could’ve been teeming with life billions of years ago.\n\nIt was just another tantalizing clue in our search for extraterrestrial life, not the smoking gun we’ve all been waiting for.\n\nNonetheless, scientists continue to be fascinated by the finding. In a paper published in the journal Astrobiology last week, a team led by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Alexander Pavlov argues that the presence of these molecules — despite the millions of years of destructive radiation that pummeled the Martian surface after it lost much of its atmosphere — “cannot be readily explained” by non-biological processes alone.\n\nOne theory is that carbon-rich dust particles and meteorites could have deposited these long-chain organic molecules on the surface, with the ancient Martian atmosphere allowing the organics to accumulate billions of years ago.\n\nHowever, Pavlov and his colleagues aren’t convinced. After studying how 80 million years’ worth of pelting radiation could have affected these molecules, they concluded that prior to the loss of the planet’s atmosphere, the concentration of these alkanes was likely much higher than previously thought. To help explain their findings, they took into account other non-biological processes in an attempt to arrive at their inferred original abundance — but couldn’t, even after combining all of them.\n\nIn other words, biological processes like the ones observed on Earth are still a leading theory, even after researchers’ best efforts to find a non-life explanation.\n\n“We argue that such high concentrations of long-chain alkanes are inconsistent with a few known abiotic sources of organic molecules on ancient Mars,” they wrote.\n\nNonetheless, they stopped well short of making any definitive statements about life on the Red Planet. After all, there could be still-unknown, non-biological processes we don’t know about that could have resulted in the observed concentration of long-chain carbon molecules on Mars.\n\n“We agree with Carl Sagan’s claim that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and understand that any purported detection of life on Mars will necessarily be met with intense scrutiny,” they concluded in their paper. “In addition, in practice with established norms in the field of astrobiology, we note that the certainty of a life detection beyond Earth will require multiple lines of evidence.”\n\nNonetheless, it’s a tantalizing waypoint in our longstanding efforts to determine whether Mars, a planet that was once covered in huge oceans, rivers, and lakes, could have supported life.\n\nPavlov and his colleagues are now calling for further research into how radiation degraded these intriguing molecules under Mars-like conditions to shed more light on the matter.\n\nMore on Mars: Scientists Find Evidence of Ancient Tropical Oasis on Mars",

    "fullText": "The GoFundMe for James Van Der Beek’s widow and six children is now deep into seven figures. The line that lit the fuse is not vague, and it is not a quote from a random commenter.\n\nIt is from the fundraiser itself.\n\n“The costs of James’s medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,” the GoFundMe description says, adding that they are “working hard to stay in their home.”\n\nAs of Saturday, Feb. 14, at about 8.25 p.m. ET, the page showed $2,587,823 raised from about 48,600 donations.\n\nThat is the headline. The comment section is the story. And people are already arguing about who ‘deserves’ help.\n\nThe GoFundMe asks for $1.5 million. The page describes \"significant financial strain\" during James' long illness, medical bills, living expenses, and keeping the kids' education stable while they grieve. What the page doesn't mention: the $4.76 million ranch James purchased about one month before his death.\n\nThat omission is why people are fighting.\n\nThe phrase \"out of funds\" appears on the page, inviting everyone to become a forensic accountant with no access to the actual books. It triggers the same two instincts every time.\n\nOne camp sees a widow with six kids facing crushing medical debt from a two-year cancer battle and says: Of course, they need help. Terminal illness destroys families financially, even families with multimillion-dollar assets.\n\nThe other camp sees a $4.76 million ranch purchase and says: Sell the house, downsize, don't ask strangers for money when you're sitting on millions in real estate.\n\nThis did not start with the GoFundMe.\n\nMonths earlier, Van Der Beek put career memorabilia into a Propstore auction, and PEOPLE reported that 100% of the proceeds from the items would go to him “to help with the financial cost of fighting cancer.”\n\nThe listing included Dawson’s Creek and Varsity Blues pieces that fans actually care about, including the necklace Dawson gave Joey for prom.\n\nThis is the detail that makes the debate feel uglier. The story is not just that friends started a fundraiser after he died. The story is that a working actor with a famous credit was already selling off the artifacts of that fame to help cover the cost of being sick.\n\nThe GoFundMe has raised over $2.5 million. Steven Spielberg donated $25,000, according to The Guardian. Zoe Saldaña set up a monthly $2,500 contribution.\n\nIt helps the family. It also pours jet fuel on the argument.\n\nFor supporters, celebrity donations prove the need is real—Spielberg doesn't write $25,000 checks for nothing.\n\nFor critics, celebrity donations prove something uglier: that access to wealth determines who survives financial catastrophe, and everyone else is just supposed to beg online.\n\nPeople are not actually arguing about James Van Der Beek. They're arguing about whether someone who just bought a $4.76 million ranch has the right to ask for help. They're arguing about whether cancer should bankrupt families even when there's real estate on the books. They're arguing about what \"out of funds\" means when you own property worth millions.\n\nThe GoFundMe doesn't explain insurance coverage, asset liquidation plans, or why the ranch purchase happened. And that silence is exactly what turns the comments section into a moral trial.\n\nOne side says, \"Show us the receipts.\" Prove you're broke. Sell the ranch, then we'll talk about donating.\n\nThe other side says: If you've never watched terminal illness devour a family's finances, you don't get to demand spreadsheets before offering sympathy.\n\nJames Van Der Beek bought a $4.76 million ranch on January 9. He died on February 11. Now his widow and six kids are asking for $1.5 million in donations, and they've raised over $2.5 million.\n\nEither you believe: A dying father secured his family's housing before terminal illness drained everything else, and medical debt from a two-year cancer battle left them with property but no cash. Asking for help with bills and kids' education while grieving is reasonable.\n\nOr you believe: If you can afford to close on a $4.76 million property, you can afford to downsize before crowdfunding. Sell the ranch, move somewhere modest, and use the proceeds for living expenses. Don't ask strangers to subsidize a lifestyle you can't sustain.\n\nThere's no middle ground. You either think the ranch was a father's final act of protection, or you think it was a financial mistake the public shouldn't have to fix.\n\nThe GoFundMe has over $2.5 million in donations. The comment section has blood on the walls.\n\nShould a family ever have to crowdfund medical fallout? Or should assets always be sold first? Where’s your line?",

    "fullText": "Ramsey and Orman rarely agree but both prioritize maximizing Roth IRA contributions and eliminating debt before retirement.\n\nRoth IRAs eliminate future tax uncertainty and required minimum distributions for original account holders.\n\nPaying off high-interest debt delivers risk-free returns equal to the eliminated interest rate.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nDave Ramsey and Suze Orman rarely see eye to eye. Ramsey champions aggressive debt payoff and famously avoids credit cards altogether. Orman encourages responsible credit use and building strong credit scores. They differ on Social Security timing, annuities, and broader investment philosophy. Yet on two core retirement fundamentals, these philosophical opposites strongly align: maximize Roth IRA contributions and eliminate debt before retirement.\n\nThat alignment matters precisely because they disagree on so much else. When two advisors with fundamentally different approaches converge on the same advice, it signals principles worth examining closely.\n\nBoth Ramsey and Orman frequently highlight the advantages of Roth IRAs. You pay taxes on contributions today, then enjoy tax-free growth and tax-free qualified withdrawals in retirement. That structure removes much of the uncertainty around future tax rates.\n\nWith core CPI inflation running around 2.5% year over year, long-term purchasing power remains an ongoing concern for retirees. The benefit of tax-free compounding becomes more powerful over decades, as gains are not reduced by future ordinary income taxes during withdrawal years.\n\nTraditional IRAs defer taxes, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. If tax rates rise or your taxable income is higher than expected, that deferral can become costly. Roth IRAs reduce that risk by locking in today’s tax rate on contributions and eliminating required minimum distributions for the original account holder.\n\nFor retirees, that translates into more predictable income planning. There are no mandatory withdrawals forcing taxable income at inconvenient times, and no uncertainty about how future tax brackets might affect withdrawals.\n\nBoth advisors also stress entering retirement without debt. No mortgage. No car loans. No credit card balances. The reasoning is straightforward: fixed retirement income leaves less room for mandatory monthly payments.\n\nThe math depends on the interest rate. Paying off high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, delivers a risk-free return equal to the interest rate you eliminate, often far exceeding what conservative investments provide. Lower-rate mortgage debt can be a closer call, but the cash flow flexibility of being debt-free is a powerful advantage in retirement.",

    "description": "After working with Ukrainian soldiers, the 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards now has a \"drone hub,\" an obstacle course,\" and rigorous drone training.",
    "fullText": "An elite British battalion is reshaping its training following its work with the Ukrainians.\n\nIt built an obstacle course, added flight-hour targets, and opened a \"drone hub.\"\n\nIts commander said he underestimated how much his unit would learn from Ukrainian troops.\n\nAn elite British Army battalion is going all in on drones after working closely with Ukrainian soldiers and seeing how central these systems have become in modern warfare.\n\nThe 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards now has 78 of its 300 members qualified as drone operators, its commanding officer, Lt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, told Business Insider. The unit has big plans to increase its training and work with drones further.\n\n\"That just gives you an idea of how important this is,\" he said.\n\nThe battalion has built a training facility with drone warfare in mind, and its soldiers are heavily invested, he said, sharing that he's got soldiers asking if they can get in on the weekends and log some flying hours.\n\n\"That to me is absolutely incredible. Soldiers asking to do extra training over the weekend tells me that we must be doing something right, and it's capturing the imagination of that generation,\" Irwin-Clark said.\n\nUkraine has shown that drones are part of the \"future of warfare,\" he said, and that means knowing how to use them in combat is something that soldiers \"need to be experts at.\"\n\nWestern militaries, including the UK and US, are studying the drone war in Ukraine closely. The conflict has become the most drone-saturated in history, forcing armies to rethink how they fight.\n\nSome units are doing more than watching from afar though. The 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards was able to learn directly from Ukrainian soldiers during a UK-led training initiative called Operation Interflex.\n\nWhile the operation is designed to train Ukrainian soldiers, the exchange has not been one-way. Ukrainian troops — many with recent front-line experience — have shared hard-won lessons. Ukraine has far more experience employing drones at scale than Western militaries.\n\nIrwin-Clark said his battalion is \"learning the lessons on behalf of the rest of the army by picking them straight up from Ukrainians who, in some cases, were coming straight to us from the front line, passing on the benefit of their knowledge.\"\n\nHe said he did not expect the learning to run so deeply in the other direction when the work first started. \"I think what I hadn't anticipated over a year ago when we started our stint on Interflex is how much we would learn.\"\n\nThe battalion has built an obstacle course so soldiers can train to fly drones accurately. Irwin-Clark said he expects at least one module of each week's training cycle to be drone-related.\n\nOther battalion efforts include the recently built \"drone hub,\" a center where soldiers can fix drones, do virtual training, and use 3D printing to make drone parts. Irwin-Clark described it as \"a new thing,\" sharing that \"no other unit in the British Army has one of these yet.\"\n\nThe battalion printed its first drone body just last month. The aim is to eventually set up the hub in the back of a vehicle so that its technology, like 3D printing, can be accessible on the move and soldiers can make and repair drones in the field. Irwin-Clark said the effort is \"in its infancy.\"\n\nThe 3D printing and use of simulators for drone training came directly from Ukrainian recommendations, Irwin-Clark said. These are practices Ukraine's military has deemed essential.\n\nThe battalion has copied other pieces of Ukrainian doctrine that Ukrainian soldiers told it about, like using anti-drone nets and viewing 60 hours as the minimum flying time typically needed to be competent.\n\nIrwin-Clark said the biggest shock for him was how fast his soldiers were able to demonstrate drone skills. \"What surprised me the most was how quickly people picked it up.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump made another careful descent of the Air Force One stairs Friday afternoon following his arrival in Palm Beach, Florida, this time clutching Melania’s hand all the way down.\n\nTrump, 79, disembarked with the first lady, and the two then climbed into the Beast, the armored presidential vehicle. Trump is spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, the de facto winter White House.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what plans—if any—the two had to mark Valentine’s Day; the White House did not respond to the Daily Beast’s question about that.\n\nAs for Trump’s health, spokesperson Davis Ingle sent a recycled statement: “President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in American history. While the deranged and failing Daily Beast has their lightweight, glue-sniffing ‘reporters’ push baseless conspiracy theories—President Trump spent the day meeting with military families and putting the American people first.”\n\nSince taking office for the second time, Trump has been seen making many cautious descents of both Air Force One and Marine One, which is even less elevated.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month with former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who appears to have missed his life as a podcaster, Trump explained that his deliberate steps are to avoid tripping as Joe Biden did in 2021, when the then-president was 78 years old.\n\n“I’ve got to be very careful going in,” Trump said about walking up the stairs. “Ever noticed how slowly I am these days? Nice and slowly—I’m not looking to set any records. You don’t want to go down. Could happen, could happen. But it can’t happen three times in one shot, OK?”\n\nAnother factor at play is how Trump has been seen with swelling around his ankles. In 2025, the White House announced that the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition common in seniors, which makes it difficult for blood to return to the heart from the lower extremities.\n\nTrump takes aspirin—a higher than normal dosage—which acts as a blood thinner. This, combined with his frequent and vigorous handshaking, regularly causes bruising to the president’s hands, according to the White House.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Melania’s grip will have the same effect.",

    "title": "Footprints left 327 years ago challenge Mississippi Coast history",
    "description": "In my lifetime, local debates over the location of the first French steps on the place we call home abound.",
    "fullText": "The equivalent of Neil Armstrong’s footprints were imprinted on the sands of the Mississippi Gulf Coast 327 years ago. The anniversary of this momentous footfall fell on Tuesday, with the actual date being Feb. 10, 1699.\n\nThe location of those first footprints will never be known. Historians with an understanding of the Mississippi Sound, islands and mainland believe the site to be the beach in front of the Edgewater Mall in present-day Biloxi. Or thereabout.\n\nIn my lifetime local debates over the location abound, although the pointing fingers have become less aggressive as modern folk agree to share their founding history. For sure, five ships anchored at Ship Island on February 10 because the water was too shallow to anchor near the mainland.\n\nThese Frenchmen were in search of the mouth of the Mississippi River. They also wanted to cement France’s ownership, keep the Spanish and English at bay and build a warmer-weather port on the Gulf as a great trade center, especially for furs.\n\nHistorians know they first anchored off Ship Island on Feb. 10 because of French-to-English translations of two journals. The one from frigate Le Marin was written by an unknown yeoman. The journal from the 30-gun frigate La Badine belonged to expedition leader, Pierre LeMoyne d’Iberville.\n\nThe expedition was commissioned by King Louis XIV, who wanted to expand his New World holdings. Louis sent them to locate the Mississippi, first explored in the 1500s by DeSoto of rival Spain and later claimed for France by LaSalle in 1682.\n\nThe ships carried an assortment of French-Canadian woodsmen, Caribbean pirates and seasoned French Marines. All were adventurers. Iberville himself was from New France, today’s Canada.\n\nThe day after anchoring off Ship Island, some of the men set up camp on the island, though many remained aboard. On their third day at the island, they noticed campfires on the mainland shore and fired three cannon shot to alert the Native Americans, whom the Marin yeoman called “savages.”\n\nOn the fourth day, which was February 13, Iberville, the expedition’s priest, a Native interpreter and 13 men took a biscayenne (longboat with a sail) and a bark-canoe to the mainland “four leagues north” of their anchored ships. Soon their footprints mixed with those of the Natives.\n\nThey set up camp after following “two trails of Indians,” eastward by two leagues, according to Iberville who did not call them “savages.” They ate oysters and saw turkey tracks.\n\nOn the fifth day, after seeing more footprints, the Marin journal reports “Monsieur d’Iberville came back to our fire and placed some glass beads, vermilion and two pipes full of tobacco as presents to show them that we meant peace.”\n\nIberville writes of following elusive Natives and finding an old man too sick to walk by the canoes they’d left behind as they rest fled. He made a fire and shelter for him and gave him presents and tobacco before returning to his own camp.\n\nThat fifth day they also communicated with a frightened old woman who had likely come to help the man left behind. She, too, was given gifts and food, and then “went to her people that same evening and gave them a complete account of what had just passed,” according to the Marin diary.\n\nThe sixth day, February 15, is today 327 years later. Iberville went to see the old man and witnessed his death. The day was spent trying to coax other reluctant Natives to interact with them. Food and gifts were exchanged, including freshly pounded dried corn.\n\nIberville recorded that the Natives “came along to sing the calumet of peace to me.” The gifts he gave were “axes, knives, shirts, tobacco, pipes, tinderboxes and glass beads.”\n\nThe mention of glass beads is humorous because of Mardi Gras. Think about it: The men on these five ships were mostly Catholic and would have observed Mardi Gras in 1699, aboard their ships at Ship Island or in spin-off searches for the Mississippi River. Mobile and New Orleans – cities that like to claim the birth of the American Mardi Gras carnival – did not exist.\n\nIn 1699 what would become the vast Louisiana Territory was in its infancy, not yet enclosing the 15 present-day states that would become part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.\n\nThe main characters of this 1699 story are two LeMoyne brothers, the 37-year-old expedition leader Iberville and his 19-year-old bro, Jean Baptiste LeMoyne de Bienville, who would take over when Iberville died of suspected yellow fever in 1706. Bienville would also establish New Orleans.\n\nBut first came Fort Maurepas on this Coast. By April 1699 the French were busy building a fort as their homeport in an area Iberville named “Biloxi” after a local tribe. Today we know that first Biloxi as Ocean Springs.\n\nThe French deserted Fort Maurepas to move eastward to Mobile, which they also deserted after a bad hurricane and headed back to the original Biloxi. The French decided the original Fort Maurepas site wasn’t suitable so they left their renamed “Old Biloxi,” moved across the bay and built a new Fort Louis in an area they designated as “New Biloxi.” The location is thought to be on higher ground near the large waterfront cemetery in present-day Biloxi.\n\nOld Biloxi and New Biloxi were left to fend for themselves when the French next permanently moved the capital of the colony to a new site they named New Orleans in 1722.\n\nConfusing? These historic hopscotch maneuvers no doubt led to the history wrangles between present-day Biloxi, present-day Ocean Springs, a town named D’Iberville sandwiched between them, and, of course, New Orleans and Mobile. Everyone loves to tout their so-called “firsts.”\n\nInterestingly, Ocean Springs holds an annual pageant they call the Landing of D’Iberville, plus the city maintained a Fort Maurepas replica before Hurricane Katrina destroyed it. Biloxi, on the other hand, took center stage in planning numerous Tricentennial celebrations in 1999.\n\nFor that 300th birthday of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, the editors of this newspaper handed me the history reins, expecting me to write a lot of articles and columns. Happy to oblige, was I.\n\nOne “Coast Sense of Place” I wrote in February 1999 is titled “Iberville’s Influence flavors Coast.” I quote most of it here:\n\n“If you think all this hoopla over Iberville and the Tricentennial is much ado about nothing, think again. Pierre Le Moyne Sieur d’Iberville is our Neil Armstrong.\n\n“Just as Astronaut Neil stepped into the unknown, so did our man Pierre. This duo of adventurers represents different times, but the missions were the same – to explore the unknown, to look danger square in the eyes and conquer it.\n\n“When Iberville stepped on the mainland Feb. 13, 1699, he made one small step for France, one giant step for Coastkind. His first footsteps on the sand of Biloxi signaled a vast French colony and all that followed – the Louisiana Purchase that included the present-day states of Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana and a national expansion that is vital to our growth.\n\n“Iberville did something else that we seldom credit: he gave this region a unique flavor.\n\n“Try to imagine what we would be like if the English, who already colonized much of the East, had made it this far.\n\n“If our man Pierre had not come, we’d likely have been settled by British Protestants. I’m not saying that’s bad, mind you, but we’d definitely be different. The mannerisms, attitude and joie de vivre that those early Catholic French left behind are very much a part of the Mississippi Coast and Louisiana psyche. In fact, I’ve noticed that this mentalité français has tentacled to other neighboring Southern states.\n\n“Imagine no Mardi Gras parade – or for that matter no parades where beaded necklaces and all manner of other trinkets are thrown to spectators. Imagine no gumbo, no jambalaya, no crusty French bread for po-boys. Akkk, we’d be eating potatoes instead of rice at every meal. Imagine us void of our colorful Cajun and Creole heritage.\n\n“The French, for the most part, mingled nicely with the Native Americans, Spanish, African-Americans, Irish, Italians, later-day Cajuns, Slavonians and all those other immigrant groups. Like a good gumbo, this ethnic pot today has distinct flavors but remains highly seasoned with a French filé.”\n\nKat Bergeron, an award-winning veteran reporter and feature writer who specializes in Gulf Coast history and sense of place, is retired from the Sun Herald.

    "fullText": "What is the hardest coaching job in world sport?\n\nWe are talking about the ‘poisoned chalice’ roles — mostly big teams where standards are high, fans’ expectations are higher and where coaches also have to contend with the weight of a glorious history.\n\nWe asked our writers across all sports for their nominations for the title, from Manchester United to the USWNT via Ferrari team principal (among others). In each case, reporters were asked to focus on those teams’ wider historical context rather than simply this current season.\n\nAt the end of the article, you can vote for the job you think is the hardest in world sport. This list is far from definitive, so please do make your own suggestions in the comments below if you feel we have missed any roles out.\n\nCoaching the England men’s team is such a peculiar role that it even has a name attached: ‘An Impossible Job’. Former manager Graham Taylor was the subject of a documentary of the same name, which laid bare the team’s unsuccessful bid to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.\n\nPart of this is just the natural effect of assuming this country cares more about its national team than others. Many other nations have a lot of public pressure on this role and a lot of expectation, too. Yes, in the past, the media glare in that job has been ferocious — but that is not the case in quite the same way now. And it is certainly not distinctive to England either.\n\nPerhaps the hardest element is to bridge the gap between resources and record. The England men’s team have won one major tournament: the World Cup hosted by the country in 1966. But they now have the richest, most popular football league in the world in the Premier League on their doorstep. And yet, turning that to the advantage of the England team is a challenge that has yet to be resolved.\n\nCan Thomas Tuchel, the current coach who this week signed a new deal until the European Championship in 2028, be the man to do that at last?\n\nThere are many layers to why coaching the New York Jets feels like an impossible job. Let’s start with the simple statement: they are the New York Jets.\n\nThere is not an NFL team that has been referred to mockingly, or derisively, or served as the butt of a joke in television shows, movies or sketch comedies quite like this team. That reputation is part of what makes it hard to work here: the “Same Old Jets” of it all, a feeling that, eventually, things will go terribly, even when it feels like there is hope.\n\nThat ties to the franchise’s history. This is a team that has not won a Super Bowl since 1969 and has not found any sort of stability at quarterback since then, either. Coaching the Jets means answering to a fanbase that has grown increasingly angry the longer their playoff-less streak (15 years and counting) goes on. Current head coach Aaron Glenn is a beloved former Jets player and he was not granted much of a grace period — after one losing season, fans are already calling for his head.\n\nThe other challenge: ownership. Woody Johnson is known to be meddlesome, impatient and easily influenced by headlines.\n\nBut really, it all falls under the “Same Old Jets” umbrella, which coaches have failed to overcome going on for a few decades now.\n\nManaging Real Madrid is a uniquely difficult challenge. Florentino Perez, long-serving president of the record 15-time European Cup/Champions League winners, has little patience for long-term projects or planning, and no time for excuses or mitigating factors such as injuries or misfortune.\n\nPerez fills the dressing-room with big-name players who do not always fit together well, rarely enjoy detailed tactical instruction and seldom take responsibility when the team is not doing well.\n\nMadrid are actually owned by 80,000 members who demand the highest standards — and are surrounded by a voracious local media who mercilessly criticise anyone who even temporarily falls short.\n\nTo enjoy success in the Spanish capital, Madrid’s coach must be able to motivate and organise star players, while showing humility and intelligence in dealing with Perez, and accepting the only thing that really counts is regularly winning the biggest trophies.\n\nSince 2000, Madrid have had 18 different coaches — and just three have won a Champions League: Vicente del Bosque in 2000 and 2002, Carlo Ancelotti in 2014, 2022 and 2024, and Zinedine Zidane in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nOther coaches with big reputations and personalities who have tried but failed include Jose Mourinho, Fabio Capello, Rafa Benitez, and, most recently, former playing icon Xabi Alonso. It is no surprise that the current incumbent, another former player, Alvaro Arbeloa, is feeling the pressure after just eight games.\n\nAll Formula 1 team principal jobs (the closest to a head coach’s role in other sports) come with pressure. But none compares to that of Ferrari, the sport’s most historic and trophy-laden team, who demand nothing but success. All of Italy is watching.\n\nIt is something Fred Vasseur, Ferrari’s team principal since 2023, felt last year. The team narrowly missed out on the title in 2024, only to then slide backwards and endure a winless season, despite the blockbuster signing of Lewis Hamilton. By mid-season, Vasseur was facing deep scrutiny in the press. Even with a new contract signed last June, that spotlight will only dim once success arrives.\n\nVasseur is Ferrari’s fifth team principal since 2014, with each of the past four changes coming abruptly in response to a lack of success. Simply fighting for wins is not enough to satisfy Ferrari’s board, the Italian press, or its fans watching around the world. Championships are the only currency they want to deal in.\n\nVasseur is acutely aware of that, his goal being to finally be the person to end Ferrari’s title drought (they last won the drivers’ title in 2007 and the constructors’ crown in 2008) and succeed in F1’s toughest job. But he needs to break the trend of his predecessors to make that happen.\n\nManchester United's 20 top-flight league titles, dating back to 1908, have been won by only three men: Ernest Mangnall, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson. That is the same number of league-winning managers that Liverpool have had since 1990, Chelsea have had since 2010 and Manchester City have had since 2012.\n\nIt took United five attempts to land on Busby's true successor. That was long enough, but their next permanent manager will be the seventh since Ferguson's retirement after winning 38 trophies in his 26 years in charge.\n\nThat success made United one of the biggest clubs in the world — almost certainly the biggest in the English-speaking world — but also set an almost impossible standard to meet.\n\nWhoever eventually puts United back on their perch, in Ferguson's parlance, will have to work with an unpopular ownership, an insatiable media and a long list of ex-players who have been there, won it and started a podcast.\n\nBut most of all, they will need to match the expectation that United should be the dominant force in English football, even more than a decade on from the last of those league titles.\n\nTottenham are, in theory, one of the world’s most promising football clubs.\n\nBased in London, an international financial and sporting capital, they can attract talent over competition from most teams in the Premier League and beyond, and their world-class stadium and training ground are, or at least should be, a dream to operate in. They also have wealthy owners.\n\nAll of this leads to high expectations, but Spurs, irrespective of the manager, have consistently fallen short.\n\nNow-USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino is considered the club’s most successful manager in the 21st century, taking Tottenham to a Champions League final and their highest finish in Premier League history (second). It felt like a golden age in waiting, but Spurs lost that final to Liverpool in 2019 and did not become English champions under Pochettino, failing to capitalise on the moment.\n\nSince then, Spurs have been on a steady decline — and no one has got particularly close to rescuing them over a sustained period.\n\nNo matter who has stood in the dugout, whether it has been Premier League winners Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte, or Ange Postecoglou (who delivered the club's first trophy in 17 years last season at the expense of the club's worst league finish since 1976-77), Nuno Espirito Santo or Thomas Frank — the latter was sacked on Wednesday after only joining in June while Spurs have appointed the Croatian Igor Tudor until the end of the season — the product has never consistently matched the near-league-leading ticket prices. And the coaches are the ones who regularly take the blame.\n\nTottenham currently sit 16th in the Premier League, which led to the board moving on from Frank this week.\n\nThe potential of the young squad and the opportunity for investment should make them an exciting proposition for many top-class head coaches. But almost every type of manager has tried to establish Spurs as league and Champions League contenders post-Pochettino — and all have failed.\n\nThe average tenure of a permanent Chelsea manager this century is 532 days, or 17 and a half months. Across almost two decades of ownership under Roman Abramovich, the club ruthlessly chewed through many of the world’s most famous and successful coaches, banking a steady flow of trophies and pressing the ‘eject’ button at the first sign of failure.\n\nIt says something, then, that the Stamford Bridge dugout has become an even less forgiving environment since Abramovich, a Russian oligarch, sold up in 2022, following UK government sanctions imposed on him after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLiam Rosenior is BlueCo’s fourth permanent head coach appointment in four years, and those numbers do not even account for Thomas Tuchel — the Champions League winner they inherited and quickly sacked, now in charge of England — or Frank Lampard, who returned for a second miserable stint as caretaker boss in 2023.\n\nTo win at the highest level with one of Europe’s youngest squads and satisfy a demanding and increasingly disillusioned fanbase is challenging enough. Then there is Chelsea’s unique executive structure, with co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart heading up an increasingly sprawling brain trust overseeing everything from recruitment to injury prevention and management.\n\nIt is a structure that can only accommodate a head coach, not a manager, and both Mauricio Pochettino (in charge from 2023-2024) and Enzo Maresca grew weary of working within it. Rosenior, promoted with startling speed from BlueCo sister club Strasbourg, has been handed an incredible opportunity so early in his coaching career — but also a frighteningly difficult path to walk.\n\nPicture this: the biggest media market in the country. The franchise with by far the most World Series championships. The most intense fans in the game.\n\nThose are just a few things breathing down the neck of the manager of the New York Yankees.\n\nCalling it a tough job would be a major understatement. It even appears to take a physical toll — just look at the before and after photos of Joe Torre and Joe Girardi, who held the position before Aaron Boone took over in 2018.\n\nPressure like this exists nowhere else in baseball. Other teams tank for higher draft picks or trade their best players to retool, giving up today for a better tomorrow. In the Bronx, there is no such luxury. The Yankees must win every year — the fans demand it.\n\nTo the credit of owner Hal Steinbrenner, he does spend money bringing in some of the sport’s biggest names. But with great talent on the field also comes great expectations in the dugout — all while the manager is forced to explain his decisions to reporters twice a day while maintaining harmony between the clubhouse and the decision-makers in the front office.\n\nIn the biggest city in the U.S., being Yankees manager is a job nobody else can relate to.\n\nYou only need to look at the furore that followed recent defeats by Arsenal and Manchester City — and read The Athletic’s in-depth piece on the crisis happening behind the scenes — to understand the pressure that comes with managing Chelsea women. Sonia Bompastor has only lost three of her 37 Women’s Super League matches in charge of Chelsea since she was appointed in 2024, but there are still fans unhappy with the French manager.\n\nBompastor is a victim of her own success. Last season, she led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble, and the expectations set by her predecessor and now-USWNT coach Emma Hayes, who won 16 trophies in her 12 years at the club. The standard at the club is unforgiving, and entertaining the idea of anything but total dominance is seen as a failure.\n\nThe only women’s club team with comparable expectations are Barcelona, where squad cohesion is helped by the fact that so many of the players are also longtime Spain team-mates. Bompastor has to integrate big-name signings from across the globe. Having such an array of talent is a blessing, but it leaves her with nowhere to hide.\n\nThe rest of the WSL are also narrowing the gap on Chelsea, whereas the only real threat to Barcelona’s dominance in Spain are Real Madrid, and even they have only beaten Barca once in 24 meetings.\n\nThe U.S. women’s national team’s win at the 1999 World Cup set a new bar and served as a catalyst not only for the women’s game domestically but around the world.\n\nThe head that wears the crown has always been heavy: until recently, the expectation of the USWNT was to not only win, but to annihilate opponents (think that 13-0 drubbing of Thailand at the start of their 2019 World Cup campaign). Head coach Emma Hayes will doubtless have found that out for herself since being appointed in 2023.\n\nIf anything, the job has become harder as the talent gap between the U.S. and every other nation has narrowed; they are No 2 in FIFA’s world rankings, trailing World Cup winners Spain.\n\nBalancing sustainable player development while still achieving results — yes, even in international friendlies — is a delicate balance to strike under the spotlight, and there may be no stage more daunting in women’s football than the USWNT.\n\nIt is beyond a joke, really. Just think of the Grampa Simpson meme showing him walking in and out, and that is Watford.\n\nThe second-tier side go through head coaches — it is ironic that they give them such a lofty title in the first place — quicker than you can say, \"another one bites the dust”.\n\nSince the Italian businessman Gino Pozzo bought the club in 2012, he has micro-managed his way through 23 incumbents of football's hottest seat. For context, there had been 34 in the club's 109-year history before then.\n\nOnly five coaches have lasted a whole campaign. Five seasons — including this one — have seen three different men in the dugout. In 2014-15 and 2019-20, there were four.\n\nIt appeared the hire-and-fire culture worked, as Watford spent six of seven seasons in the Premier League from 2015 to 2022. But they are not even a yo-yo club anymore. The string has snapped, the parachute payments from Premier League relegation have stopped, and that revolving door keeps on turning. Next!\n\nIt is a mistake to think of the Bayern Munich job as a coaching role — it is much more than that.\n\nThe starting point for the record 34-time German champions is that anything less than a domestic double of trophies each season is seen as performing below par, with every unconvincing performance — even in victory — subject to inquest.\n\nBut then there is the rapacious Bavarian and national media, for whom negativity about Bayern is big business, and a dressing room always loaded with forthright personalities and egos.\n\nThe club’s elders, Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, present a separate challenge. Hoeness, the honorary president who played for Bayern from 1970 to 1979, rarely has an unspoken thought, especially about the standard of the team or the quality of coaching, meaning that plenty of scrutiny comes from inside the club, from seemingly unimpeachable figures.\n\nA Bayern coach needs tremendous presence, but also the humility to know their place at certain times and when to be deferential. That is a balance few have found in the club’s modern history.\n\nThe hardest coaching job is one where expectations are high, patience is low and, sometimes, the view is irrational. In the NBA, that means the jobs at two high-profile teams on each coast.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers head coach lives under constant strain. Pressure is intensely high for a fanbase (and ownership) used to winning. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles, the second-most in league history. They are not used to losing. Even winning the NBA Cup (a feat with a nebulous value) is not enough. Darvin Ham was fired in 2024, the year after making the conference finals and hanging a Cup banner.\n\nThe Lakers have had 11 coaches in the last 25 years but only one has lasted more than three seasons in the job: Phil Jackson (from 1999-2004 and 2005-2011). Even Frank Vogel was fired in 2022, two years after winning a title.\n\nThe New York Knicks head coach feels the pressure, too. There have been 15 of them since 2000. But that franchise has not won an NBA championship in 53 years. The owner is demanding and impatient, and success is only success on the right terms.\n\nAfter two decades of ineptitude, Tom Thibodeau was fired last spring, despite leading the Knicks to their best finish in a quarter-century. Good luck to the new coach, and the one who replaces him.\n\nThere is an old cliche about the difficulty of coaching national teams in football. Clubs have big fanbases, sure, but they are splintered and spread around. When you manage a country, the number of people who think they can do a better job than you is roughly equal to the entire population.\n\nIn Brazil, that number is about 210million. Nearly all of them are obsessed with football. The older generations remember a time when the national team were the dominant force in the international game. The rest grew up hearing the tales and watching the videos — and many will still have seen one or two of the more recent World Cup wins (Brazil have lifted the game's most prestigious title a record five times). It is understandable that expectation often curdles into entitlement.\n\nWhat complicates things is a knot of competing dynamics. There are the zigzagging inferiority/superiority complexes when it comes to how Brazilian football compares to that played in Europe. There is the deathless debate around the compatibility — or otherwise — of winning and entertaining. There is also the fact that Brazil’s national self-image is so bound up with football.\n\nThe Brazil coach is not just picking 11 players and planning corner routines. He has to plot a course through all of that other stuff, all while loaded down by the weight of history. It is no great wonder most fail.\n\nNo NHL coaching job is quite like it.\n\nA longest-in-league-history championship drought means bringing the Stanley Cup to Toronto would all but guarantee instant legendary status and a statue outside the arena. The problem? That same historic drought — and all the failures along the way — have added to the pressure and noise in hockey’s largest market.\n\nCanada’s most populated city counts a fanbase that has only grown in the face of annual disappointment. The Maple Leafs, the NHL’s most valuable team, last won the Stanley Cup in 1967. There were just six teams in the league at the time. Today, there are 32.\n\nSince Punch Imlach led the Leafs to that last championship, 21 other coaches have tried — and ultimately failed — to satisfy a starved fanbase. Despite the billions of dollars invested over the years into the team’s expensive roster, facilities, resources and staff, the Leafs have never won more than two playoff rounds in a single season in that time.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2012, the Leafs did not even make the playoffs, adding to their sense of perennial heartbreak. Four coaches failed during that time. Two of them won the Stanley Cup elsewhere — giving weight to the notion that the Leafs might be cursed.\n\nWith 25 games remaining this season, the Leafs are in danger of missing the playoffs altogether for the first time in a decade. Craig Berube, a former Stanley Cup-winning coach who has been leading Toronto since 2024, is the latest person in the hot seat.\n\nPutting this season aside, the job of coaching one of Scotland’s big two could be naively regarded as a cakewalk. Historically, and certainly since the turn of the century, their budgets have dwarfed those of every other Scottish team. Your job, therefore, is to finish in front of the club over the road. Simple.\n\nBut in that respect, there is nowhere to hide. If you are Rangers and you wind up behind Celtic, you might as well have finished bottom. The same is true in reverse. To attend an Old Firm fixture, as the rivalry is known, is to understand the frenetic, vitriolic, passionate and sometimes poisonous world of football in Glasgow. It looks like easy street when it goes well. It is an untold nightmare if it goes badly.\n\nAnd, very often, the fate of a coach is wholly dictated by the structure around them and above them. Strain at boardroom level filters down onto the pitch, affecting resources and the quality of performances.\n\nYou have seen that at Rangers for more than a decade. You are seeing it at Celtic now. Yes, Wilfried Nancy was a disaster of an appointment, sacked after 33 days in charge last month — but when were Celtic last set up to fail as they seem to be at present? It made Nancy’s job a hospital pass, regardless of whether the former Columbus Crew coach was ever the right fit.\n\nWith regards to Glasgow, Vince Lombardi was bang on: there is no room for second place. It is sink or swim from a manager’s first morning in post — and rather them than me.\n\nThere is a phrase in Turkish football which roughly translates as “titles are won at the airport” — a reference to the big-name signings who are often greeted with frantic scenes when they get off the plane to finalise their deals.\n\nThe idea that new arrivals will inevitably mean success is an attitude shared by club presidents, too. The message to their coaches is “we’ve given you the stars, now win something”.\n\nWhich is part of the reason that coaching any of Istanbul’s big three clubs — Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas — is almost an impossible job. Plenty of cultures think of football as a form of religion, but there are not many cities that do so with such chaotic intensity as Istanbul.\n\nGood luck to anyone in charge of any of them, but right now the biggest pressure is on Fenerbahce. Historically the most successful club in Turkey (they have won 28 Turkish titles to Galatasaray’s 26), they have not been champions since 2014, their longest-ever drought, and have had to watch Galatasaray demolish them for the last three seasons.\n\nThey are on their 11th different manager since that last success, and things are getting desperate: Jose Mourinho was sacked earlier this season and the man now in the hot seat is former Belgium manager Domenico Tedesco.\n\nKalen DeBoer took on maybe the greatest challenge in college football history two years ago by signing up to be the coach who replaced Nick Saban. Saban produced an unprecedented run of six national titles in 17 seasons at Alabama from 2007 to 2023.\n\nAlabama fans became accustomed to ruling the sport under Saban. But it has historically set the standard at national championship for its football program, long predating Saban. Before him, coach Bear Bryant won six national championships with the football team during the 1960s and 1970s and their excellence stretches back almost a century — with their 30 Southeastern Conference football championships by far the most in the history of the storied league.\n\nIn the early to mid-1900s, a time in the United States when elite Northeast universities and large institutions in the Midwest often ruled the sport, Alabama was a Southern powerhouse and source of pride for much of the state, though in-state rival Auburn also commands similar support. That Iron Bowl rivalry is yet another aspect that makes the Alabama job so difficult. An otherwise successful season can be severely damaged or even ruined by a loss to Auburn in the regular-season finale.\n\nThere is a saying that college football is like a religion in the Deep South, as much a part of a fan's identity as their faith. Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, capacity 100,077, is among college football's largest and most hallowed cathedrals. Successful coaches at Alabama become legends. Coaches who fail to meet the lofty expectations, even respected alumni such as Ray Perkins, Mike DuBose and Mike Shula, are forever remembered for their shortcomings.\n\nIndia are international cricket’s sole powerhouse. Even if Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand can compete in terms of the talent of their first team, India have a much deeper overall pool. The country has a total population of more than 1.4billion.\n\nGiven the perceived player advantage they possess, the coach faces immense scrutiny from all corners in a country that views the sport as a religion and its stars as gods. No sport rivals cricket’s status and no celebrities rival cricketers’ popularity in India.\n\nIndia wield immense financial firepower as a result and a considerable influence over cricket’s global body, the International Cricket Council. Jay Shah, the son of the nation’s home minister, is the council’s chairman.\n\nThose elements also make the coach’s job a fairly thankless one as India are expected to — and arguably should — beat every team they face.\n\nWhat do you think the hardest coaching job in world sport is?

    "fullText": "ARLINGTON, Texas — Arkansas baseball is already dealing with an injury to one of its key players after the second game of a young season.\n\nRight fielder Kuhio Aloy was removed during the eighth inning of the No. 5 Razorbacks' (1-1) 5-4 loss to No. 10 TCU on Saturday, Feb. 14. Aloy hit his first home run of the season in the top of the seventh, but freshman Christian Turner replaced Aloy in right field to begin the bottom of the eighth.\n\nArkansas coach Dave Van Horn said he saw Aloy limping as he ran around the bases after his home run, and the Hawaiian slugger is dealing with a hamstring injury.\n\n\"I don't want it to get worse,\" Van Horn said. \"We didn't even know about it. Just a little tightness in his hamstring, and I just said it isn't worth losing him for a month for this one.\"\n\nThrough two games, Aloy is 3 for 8 with one homer, three RBIs and two runs while hitting fifth in the lineup. He led Arkansas with 70 RBIs in 2025.\n\nIf Aloy can't play on Sunday against Texas Tech, Turner could be in line for his first start.

    "description": "Utes follow the lead of seniors Lani White and Maty Wilke while putting up 22 assists on 24 made field goals.",
    "fullText": "Having lost its past two games and three of its previous four, the Utah women’s basketball team needed a spark to push its NCAA tournament hopes back in the right direction when Cincinnati came to the Huntsman Center on Saturday evening.\n\nThe Utes found that spark by doing what they do best — sharing the ball.\n\nUtah had 22 assists on 24 made buckets, and the Utes beat the Bearcats 67-59 in front of a crowd that included plenty of former Utah players on hand for Elaine Elliott’s banner celebration.\n\nUtah’s winningest head coach was honored at halftime, and thankfully for the crowd, the Utes (17-9, 8-6 Big 12) put on a show good enough for a win.\n\n“It’s been a minute since we’ve won at home. I’m really excited about that. We had 22 assists on 24 made baskets. That’s Utah basketball,” Utah coach Gavin Petersen said.\n\n“I’m really proud of our kids for moving the ball and sharing the ball.”\n\nThat effort was led by senior Lani White, who dropped in a game-high 23 points and hit six 3-pointers.\n\nShe also had six rebounds and two assists to counter four turnovers while shooting 8 of 14 from the field.\n\n“I was confident in my shot, but I was trying to play within our offense, kick out 3s, just playing inside out,” White said.\n\n“The rim looked a lot bigger after the first shot went in. I was trying to stay within our system and hit the normal shots that we always shoot.”\n\nWhite’s fellow senior Maty Wilke also came up big, adding 12 points, four rebounds, four assists and three steals.\n\nWhile it wasn’t the best shooting night for the Utes, who shot 41.4% from the floor and were 8 of 29 from 3-point range, they were 11 of 14 from the free-throw line.\n\nCincinnati, meanwhile, struggled scoring until the fourth quarter as it tried to rally. The Bearcats (9-17, 4-10 Big 12) shot 38.7% overall, 2 of 11 from 3-point range and 9 of 17 from the free-throw line.\n\n“The tougher team wins and the past two games, we weren’t the tougher team. Coming in today, that was our mindset,” Wilke said.\n\n“That also goes with playing hard, not just going through the motions, and no matter the result, as long as you give it your all, you can live with it.”\n\nAfter a slow start offensively for both teams, Utah got things going in the second quarter and kept it rolling in the third.\n\nThe Bearcats led 12-11 after one quarter, but the Utes outscored them 19-10 in the second frame to build an eight-point halftime lead.\n\nUtah extended that lead as high as 18 points in the third quarter before weathering a rally from Cincinnati in the final period.\n\nThe Bearcats cut it to a five-point game at 55-50 with just over four minutes to play, but Utah followed the lead of White, Wilke and Reese Ross (eight points, six rebounds, two assists) in finding enough points to keep Cincinnati at bay.\n\nWhite, in particular, hit a pair of big shots. First, she scored on a fastbreak layup to push the lead back out to seven (Utah ended the night with a 17-5 edge in fast break points).\n\nThen, with 1:32 remaining, White took a pass from LA Sneed and knocked down her final 3-pointer of the night, from straightaway, to make it a double-digit lead at 62-51.\n\nCincinnati had three players in double-figures, led by Caliyah DeVillasee, who ended up with 13 points and five assists.\n\nThe way the Bearcats clawed their way back into the game in the fourth quarter was on Utah’s minds following the contest. Far too often this year, the Utes have allowed opponents to rally against them after building big leads, and Cincinnati was no exception.\n\n“We get comfortable, but then we get casual. Unfortunately, I don’t know what it is,” White said. “... We need to work on what’s working in the first half is that we need to carry that into the second, and unfortunately, we go outside of our system and go outside of ourselves, and then we start pressing the issue.\n\n“It’s not because we have a young group. It’s just because we get comfortable and casual with that scoreboard, and that’s not Utah basketball.”\n\nPetersen said it’s a mindset the team needs to adjust.\n\n“Our mindset has had shifts from playing to win to playing not to lose,” he said. “We’ve got to figure out that we play to win.\n\n“I don’t care what the score is. I don’t care how much time is left. We are playing to win.”\n\nWith only four games left in the regular season, Utah is in a tie for seventh in the Big 12 standings with Arizona State, which swept the Utes this year.\n\nThe top eight seeds in the upcoming Big 12 tournament, which runs March 4-8 at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City, earn a first-round bye.\n\nThe victory over the Bearcats is also important to Utah’s hopes of extending its NCAA tournament streak to five seasons, as there are several Big 12 teams — the Utes included — who are considered on the bubble as the regular season winds down.\n\nUtah will have a quick turnaround after Saturday’s game, as it will play on Monday in a noon MST matchup at Oklahoma State.\n\n“Credit to Cincinnati, they started to be the aggressor and in this game sometimes you get rewarded. They made a run, but we were able to withstand that and close it out down the stretch,” Petersen said.\n\n“I’m really happy that we’re able to get this one done and now we can turn our attention to Oklahoma State and travel tomorrow, play Monday.”",

    "fullText": "In a potential sign that the Texas Longhorns are peaking at the right time to secure a bye in the NCAA Tournament, head coach Sean Miller’s team outscored the Missouri Tigers by 15 points in the second half of Saturday’s 85-68 road win at Mizzou Arena.\n\nJunior wing Dailyn Swain led the way for the Longhorns by notching 18 of his game-high 25 points after halftime in another impressive performance for the Ohio product, going 6-of-7 shooting in the second half and hitting all four of his free throws. Two of those baskets came on three-pointers off the bounce in late-clock situations to help ensure that the Tigers couldn’t mount a late comeback.\n\nTHEY. JUST. KEEP. FALLING. 😤#HookEm | @Dai1yn pic.twitter.com/Sdb5NpMvaD\n\n— Texas Men’s Basketball (@TexasMBB) February 15, 2026\n\nSophomore center Matas Vokietaitis also turned in an efficient performance, scoring 19 points on 6-of-10 shooting from the floor and 7-of-8 shooting from the line, recording a double-double with 10 rebounds, five off the offensive glass.\n\nAnd while senior guard Jordan Pope added 15 points despite battling foul trouble, some of the most important contributions for Texas came off the bench.\n\nJunior guard Simeon Wilcher overcame consecutive turnovers and a questionable technical foul ruled on review to score nine points by making both field-goal attempts and all four of his free throws in addition to notching a team-high four assists.\n\nFilling in for injured graduate forward Lassina Traore, sophomore forward Nic Codie had the most impactful conference performance of his young career, scoring nine points on 4-of-5 shooting with six rebounds, three offensive, and a block in 15 minutes.\n\nMissouri still had a four-point edge in bench points, but the margin wasn’t as large as it has been at times for Texas this season and the Longhorns were able to limit Tigers star forward Mark Mitchell to 16 points and one assist.\n\nOn the glass and around the basket, Texas secured key advantages, out-rebounding Missouri 36-26 and notching a 40-28 edge in points in the paint. That helped make up for 22 fouls turning into 38 free throws for the Tigers in a game that featured some bad fouls by the Longhorns against jump shooters, but they also played with enough composure and verticality to avoid the fouling issues that did exist from impacting the outcome.\n\nThat included some mental toughness to survive a choppy portion of the second half in which multiple long reviews disrupted the game, a sign of growth within the current surge in which the Horns have taken advantage of winnable games.\n\nWith LSU coming to the Moody Center on Tuesday with a 2-10 conference record, that stretch continues with Texas heavily favored to secure a five-game winning streak.

    "description": "At NBA All-Star Weekend, former NBA player Ron Harper threw some serious shade at LeBron James regarding the path Bronny James has taken.",
    "fullText": "Over the last couple of years, LeBron James has gotten plenty of criticism regarding the path his son Bronny has taken with his own basketball career. The elder James made it clear that his dream was to play in the NBA alongside his son, and in 2024, the younger James was taken by the Lakers with the No. 55 pick in the draft.\n\nThe two members of the James clan played in the same game at the same time in the Lakers' first contest of the 2024-25 season. Since then, the younger James has mostly failed to prove that he's worthy of any real playing time in the NBA, which has led many to attack his father for allegedly funneling him into the league instead of letting him take his time to develop at a lower level.\n\nAt NBA All-Star Weekend on Saturday, former NBA guard and five-time champion Ron Harper was interviewed alongside his sons Ron Harper Jr. and Dylan Harper. Dylan Harper is a standout rookie with the San Antonio Spurs, while Ron Harper Jr. plays for the Boston Celtics.\n\nRon Harper was asked if he ever saw his kids following in his footsteps and playing in the NBA. He replied by throwing some serious shade at the elder James.\n\n“I’m not LeBron James. I’m not going to tell my kids what they have do.”\n\nDylan Harper, in particular, has helped the Spurs establish the second seed in the Western Conference and the third-best record in the league. The 6-foot-5, 215-pound Rutgers University product is averaging 10.9 points and 3.7 assists in 21.7 minutes a game and is part of a very potent backcourt rotation for San Antonio.\n\nThe younger James, meanwhile, has mustered just 2.2 points and 1.2 assists in 7.3 minutes a game and is shooting 40% from the field this season with Los Angeles. On Tuesday, when the Spurs defeated the Lakers 136-108, Dylan Harper had 15 points and six assists, while the younger James showed a bit of spark with 12 points on 5-of-10 shooting and six assists.\n\nThe elder James has another son, Bryce, who is currently a freshman at the University of Arizona and could enter this summer's NBA draft if he wishes to.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Ron Harper takes a shot at LeBron James regarding Bronny James",

    "fullText": "Teaming with LeBron James would be ‘special’ for Cavs’ Donovan Mitchell appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nThe idea of LeBron James returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers for one last dance would be appealing for star guard Donovan Mitchell.\n\nRumors of James uniting with his first NBA team to end his career has been circling around the league. The veteran star is going through his eighth season and counting with the Los Angeles Lakers but will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason.\n\nMitchell addressed those rumors during his interview on SiriusXM NBA Radio on Saturday. He is very open to the scenario, referring to the opportunity a special one if James decides to return to Cleveland for what can be his final season in the league.\n\n“As a Bron fan, to be able to be a teammate, obviously that would be special,” Mitchell said Saturday during an interview with SiriusXM NBA Radio.\n\n“Yeah, man, it’s LeBron James. But at the end of the day, that’s not my focus. I’m not here to worry about that. I know I’m going to get asked about that a bunch all weekend … But my focus is, we just traded for James Harden, Dennis Schröder, Keon Ellis. Let’s try to find a way to get a ring.”\n\nHere’s Donovan Mitchell’s thoughts on the rumors that LeBron could finish his career in Cleveland@TermineRadio | @Jumpshot8\n\nClick here for more All-Star coverage – https://t.co/j3RPgmlH7e pic.twitter.com/lm2My2U5HQ\n\n— SiriusXM NBA Radio (@SiriusXMNBA) February 15, 2026\n\nDonovan Mitchell is right to keep his focus on the current season. The Cavaliers just traded Darius Garland to the Los Angeles Clippers for James Harden, elevating their chances of being serious contenders for the remainder of the season.\n\nMitchell continues to excel as one of the best scorers in the league. Goin through his fourth season with the Cavaliers, he is averaging 29 points, 5.9 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game throughout 51 appearances. He is shooting 48.7% from the field, including 37.6% from beyond the arc, and 85.3% from the free-throw line.\n\nCleveland has a 33-21 record on the season, holding the 4th spot in the Eastern Conference standings. They are two games above the Toronto Raptors and 3.5 games above the Philadelphia 76ers. However, they trail the New York Knicks by one game and the Boston Celtics by 1.5 games.\n\nRolling with five consecutive wins, the Cavaliers remain on hiatus until the All-Star Weekend festivities come to a close. They will resume action at home when they host the Brooklyn Nets on Feb. 19 at 7 p.m. ET.",

This time, it was Cleveland’s current superstar, Donovan Mitchell, weighing in on the matter.\n\nMitchell told SiriusXM NBA Radio that being a teammate with James would be special, but that isn’t his focus right now.\n\nMitchell’s entire quote can be read below:\n\n“As a Bron fan, to be able to be a teammate, that would obviously be special, but that’s not something in my control. I control what we got here. There’s always going to be reports, that’s natural, it’s gonna be a thing.\n\nAt the end of the day, to your point, my main focus right now is trying to get this championship.

You can buy the Spida shirt HERE. You can also shop all of Homage’s Cavs gear HERE.\n\nQuestions like this are going to keep coming up, given the recent rumors and the fact that no meaningful basketball is being played during All-Star Weekend.\n\nMitchell has the right perspective. This isn’t something that he can control, and this Cavs team is good enough to win a championship this season with how open the Eastern Conference is.\n\nAt the same time, it’s also worth acknowledging that Mitchell seems open to it based on what he’s said here and the fact that he’s made it no secret that he grew up rooting for LeBron. And there have already been rumors that Mitchell and Harden have started recruiting LeBron back home.\n\nThere would be something poetic about Mitchell — who was one of the children in attendance at The Decision in 2010 — potentially leading a championship-level Cavaliers team with James 17 years later.\n\nWe’ll see how this all plays out. The team would need to make plenty of roster moves before James could sign with the Cavs for a third stint. However, if both Mitchell and LeBron want this reunion to take place, the Cavs will undoubtedly find a way to make it all work.",

    "fullText": "BATON ROUGE — As Kim Mulkey thumbed up and down the stat sheet before her on the table, she struggled to find many things she disliked about her team's performance against South Carolina.\n\nLSU women's basketball won the rebound battle, especially on the offensive glass. It took care of the basketball, limited South Carolina's transition opportunities in the second half and it drew fouls affording itself chances at the free-throw line.\n\nFive missed free throws in the fourth quarter, including two in the waning seconds from star Flau'jae Johnson that would've given LSU the lead with 45 seconds to go, doomed the Tigers. South Carolina went on to beat LSU 79-72 in front of packed Pete Maravich Assembly Center on Saturday, Feb. 14.\n\nMORE LSU WBB COVERAGE LSU women's basketball a 2-seed in top 16 reveal. Can it get 1-seed?\n\nNo. 6 LSU (23-4, 8-4 SEC) has now lost 18 straight games to the Gamecocks (25-2, 11-1).\n\n\"What a blessing it is to have her. Now, you will focus on those last two free throws. We missed nine, there's your difference in the ballgame. We scored the same number of field goals, we outrebounded them by nine, we were 14 for 23 from the foul line, that's where the game was lost. Make your free throws, you win.\"\n\n\"I'm not real sure. If I knew that, I'd be in psychology. I have no idea. We got to the free-throw line. So reward yourself.\"\n\n\"I liked everything we did except I didn't like the way we guarded Tessa (Johnson). We didn't do what we were told to do for three days. And you can't do anything about free throws. If you look at the stat sheet, you can't be too critical of many things. We didn't turn it over much, we outrebounded them, we got to the foul line more than them. Two for 12 from the 3 and you still had a chance to win the game; 44 seconds left you can take the lead if you can make one defensive stop. We'd be sitting here celebrating. This game is tough. When you do get that many rebounds, you think you're going to win but that's not the only thing. When I look at that stat sheet and how it's so good, 'Why'd you lose, coach?' Well, look at the free throws.\"\n\nCory Diaz covers the LSU Tigers for The Daily Advertiser as part of the USA TODAY Network. Follow his Tigers coverage on Twitter: @ByCoryDiaz.

    "fullText": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. – Memphis women’s basketball lost a second straight one-possession game on Saturday afternoon at Elma Roane Fieldhouse, falling 61-58 to Charlotte.\n\nNeither team led by more than seven all afternoon, and the Tigers (8-16, 2-9 American) tied the game for a fourth time with 1:06 remaining, but Charlotte (12-13, 6-6 American) took a three-point lead that would hold as Memphis’ game-tying attempt came up short. Daejah Richmond led the Tigers with 21 points thanks to 11-of-12 free throw accuracy.\n\nThe 49ers opened the game on a 6-2 run before a four-minute scoring drought helped Memphis lead 11-6. Charlotte’s defense flipped the momentum, holding the Tigers scoreless for five minutes and grabbing an 18-11 lead before Paris Gaines put back a miss for her first points since suffering a concussion on January 31.\n\nGaines grabbed a career-high-tying 12 rebounds, 10 of which came in the first half as Memphis kept the conference’s best rebounding team at bay. Trailing by two at halftime, they had more shots than the 49ers but shot just 24% from the field. The third quarter saw more points than the first two combined, as the teams shot a collective 55%, led by Richmond’s nine points.\n\nTamya Smith’s three-pointer cut the lead to one with four minutes remaining in the third frame, but Charlotte would push the lead back out to six early in the fourth quarter. The Memphis defense went on its most impressive run of the game, forcing seven straight misses and three turnovers across six minutes to tie the game at 53.\n\nThe visitors ended their drought and took a 58-54 lead with 1:48 to play, but Memphis found a way to tie it before Charlotte even took back possession. Chaé Harris finished a tough layup through a foul, and her ensuing miss was rebounded by Cori Allen who found Richmond. The junior guard drew a foul and converted two free throws to tie the game, but lead guard Princess Anderson took back the lead with a tough mid-range shot with 45 seconds remaining.\n\nThe 49ers got a stop and split a pair at the line, leaving the Tigers a chance to tie the game, but their effort was unsuccessful in a fourth consecutive loss, three of which came by five points or less. Anderson had 23 points but did so on just 9-of-25 shooting. Asianae Nicholson posted a 10-point, 17-rebound double-double; the forward totaled 30 boards in two contests against Memphis.\n\nThe Tigers will play Tulane twice in a row this week, the first one being at home on Tuesday, February 17, at 7 p.m.",

Staley said, \"Actually they were, they were calling me boo.\"\n\nAfter the latest game, Staley was asked about the LSU crowd and the hoodies.\n\n\"Actually we were just trying to figure out what to wear and our staff wanted to wear white,\" Staley said. \"Somebody else brought up, let's do the boo hoodies and I think everyone stayed in character because I heard a lot of boos.\"\n\nThe win marked Staley's sixth against Kim Mulkey since she took over the LSU program ahead of the 2021-22 season and the 500th of her career since she came to South Carolina in 2008.\n\nSouth Carolina is 9-12 in the series in Baton Rouge and has won the last 18 straight games overall, continuing its win streak first started in 2013.\n\nMulkey donned a bright pink pantsuit with black hearts on it and a tiger on the back.\n\nStaley has incorporated high-end brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton into her wardrobe but will also go with something South Carolina- or Under Armour-related. Staley will also often wear clothing from women's sports brands as well, like Playa Society.\n\nOn Jan. 15, Staley's staff had shirts with her face on it from her time playing at Virginia. \"Love, Believe in Yourself\" was on the back and \"My favorite coach is a woman\" was on the front.\n\nMichael Glasker created the shirts custom for Staley and though she didn't wear one, the jacket she was wearing was also made by Glasker.\n\nLulu Kesin covers South Carolina athletics for The Greenville News and the USA TODAY Network.

    "description": "The three-time reigning dunk contest champion opted to not participate this year.",
    "fullText": "The 2026 NBA Slam Dunk Contest came and went on Saturday, with Miami Heat forward Keshad Johnson — who is averaging 7.6 minutes per game this season — winning the event with four dunks ranging from acceptable dunk to good dunk.\n\nLike in many years previous, the dunk contest field was an array of relatively anonymous players: Johnson, San Antonio Spurs forward Cater Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers center Jaxson Hayes and Orlando Magic rookie Jase Richardson.\n\nA notable absence from the field (in addition to every All-Star of the past five years) was Mac McClung, the G League veteran who has won the last three contests and could have made history with an unprecedented fourth. He announced last month he was sitting this one out for \"a bunch of reasons.\"\n\nHowever, McClung did decide to show off the four dunks he would have brought to the contest had he participated. Here they are:\n\nThe four dunks @macmcclung37 would’ve done this year at this year’s dunk contest 🔥\n\nWhich one was your favorite? Text DUNK to 69097 to vote! pic.twitter.com/lrtNdcoFek\n\n— Team VKTRY (@TeamVKTRY) February 15, 2026\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, the McClung dunks are both more interesting and more impressive, though we should also note we are only watching the video McClung's camp decided to record. Half the difficulty of the dunk contest is being able to pull off acrobatic moves on command, with a panel of NBA veterans to somberly shake their heads at you if you fail.\n\nThat said, McClung certainly has the benefit of the doubt given that he has landed 12 such dunks in the actual competition.\n\nWhat does this all mean for the dunk contest? It's certainly not the best look that its three-time champion responded to the actual competition with a superior group of dunks, but it's hardly the contest's biggest problem.\n\nThe contest has alternated from dying to watchable for the last decade and a half or so. When there's a McClung, an Aaron Gordon or Zach LaVine, the audience has something to grab onto. When there isn't, you certainly start to wonder why all this pageantry is put into what is essentially four lesser-known players trying to cosplay as stars. It's been a long time since LaVine and Gordon faced off in 2016, and even longer since Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins were doing it.\n\nMaybe that's harsh, but we saw how full that arena was on Saturday.",

    "description": "Former Cavaliers general manager David Griffin gave his take on the speculation that LeBron James will return to the Cavs next season.",
    "fullText": "LeBron James' first stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers wasn't very successful, at least in terms of team success. While he put up monster numbers there during his first seven seasons in the NBA, Cleveland reached the NBA Finals just once and lost there to the San Antonio Spurs in 2007, and it suffered a couple of tough playoff losses to the Boston Celtics afterward.\n\nBut when James returned in 2014, Cleveland had an infrastructure around him that was ready to compete for the NBA championship. David Griffin, whom the Cavaliers hired to be their general manager in 2010, built a supporting cast consisting of players such as Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and J.R. Smith, and the result was the franchise's first world title in 2016.\n\nThere has obviously been lots of speculation lately about James possibly returning to the Cavaliers this summer. Griffin, who most recently worked for the Pelicans before getting fired last year, chimed in on that speculation.\n\n“There’s a big part of me that would be surprised if he doesn’t, on some level, just because Northeast Ohio means so much to him. It would be surprising to me on some level if he didn't want to… I can tell you the theater of it excites me, sure.\n\n\"... He owns every record you could have… And he would give every damn one of them away to win a title here again.”\n\nJames, of course, is originally from Akron, Ohio, which is just under 40 miles away from Cleveland. Prior to last week's NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers made a couple of moves that trimmed their payroll and could pave the way for them to be able to bring James back.\n\nThe 41-year-old is currently averaging 22 points, 5.8 rebounds and 7.1 assists a game for the Los Angeles Lakers this season. He will be a free agent this summer, but first, he's set to make his 21st All-Star game appearance on Sunday. However, for the first time in his NBA career, he will come off the bench in the midseason classic.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Former Cavaliers GM on whether LeBron will go back to Cleveland",

While Woods spent last season with the Raiders as DB coach and defensive pass game coordinator, the season before, he was the DC in New Orleans while Kubiak was the OC. With Leonard getting the DC job, it just made sense to keep Woods as well.\n\nWoods has 21 years of NFL coaching experience under his belt. Among his posts was a two-year stint as DB coach in Denver in 2015-16 when Klint's father Gary Kubiak was head coach. The Broncos won the Super Bowl in his first season there.\n\nWoods becomes the first position coach in Kubiak's staff, which has yet to name an offensive coordinator. But getting two coaches locked in within a week of taking the job is moving at a good pace.

    "description": "After a brilliant 62 at Pebble Beach, Collin Morikawa opened up on the unusual putting challenges that have plagued his last several years.",
    "fullText": "PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — It was the offseason of Collin Morikawa’s life — the reset and recharge designed to springboard Morikawa’s return to world dominance.\n\nAnd then he woke up on Saturday at the Sony Open without a tee time.\n\n“I went into this year feeling really good about myself,” Morikawa said. “You go out and play two rounds at Sony and I missed the cut and you realize, man, do I need to redo everything that you thought you were doing for the last two months?”\n\nProfessional golf can be unusually cruel in this way. The margin between the best players in the world and the guys who spend their 40s as insurance brokers is less than 10 shots a week — and the margin between those at the very top and the very bottom of golf’s many statistical categories is, on average, less than 1.5 shots per round.\n\nMorikawa has lived on both sides of the totem. He arrived on the PGA Tour on a rocketship, winning a pair of major championships before his 25th birthday to announce himself as one of the game’s preeminent young talents. He has spent the back half of his twenties mired in the innermost circle of golf hell: putting woes (to go along with an unpleasant cocktail of poor form and near-misses and swing changes and caddie changes).\n\nOn Saturday at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, though, Morikawa came alive. He shot a blistering 10-under 62, recording 11 birdies to just one bogey, to vault into the final pairing for Sunday’s final round with Akshay Bhatia. Sunday will mark Morikawa’s best shot to record a signature victory in some time, perhaps since his near-miss at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in 2025.\n\nBut before he can get there, he’ll have to overcome the challenges that have marred the last several years of his golfing life: The ones arriving with the putter in his hands.\n\n“Yeah. I think I might be [uncomfortable with my putter] for the rest of my career,” an unusually candid Morikawa said Saturday afternoon. “It’s a comfort thing for me. I think I play a lot with my feel and I play a lot with my gut and unfortunately that changes a lot.”\n\nMorikawa’s putting challenges have manifested in particularly painful ways: After winning five times in less than two years to start his career, Morikawa has recorded just one victory in the last five years, which arrived at the comparatively light field at the Zozo Championship in Japan, and has watched as other stars from his rookie class (notably Scottie Scheffler) have ascended into the upper-echelons of the sport.\n\nIn that time, the putter has fallen from a solid complement of Morikawa’s otherworldly ball striking to a legitimate liability. He ranked 156th on Tour in SG: Putting in 2025, the third time he ranked worse than 100th on Tour in the same category since the winning drought started in 2022.\n\nBut putting is an art — and art is fickle. Some weeks, it can be enough to derail an entire tournament — and this week, it has hardly moved the needle. On Saturday, Morikawa ranked near the bottom of the field in most putting stats, making just 55 feet of putts all day, and he recorded one of the best rounds of his year.\n\nThe lesson, he said, came not from a shift in putting technique or ability but from a change in mindset.\n\n“[Mental coach Rick Sessinghaus] reminded me yesterday when I first came out and turned pro, like I didn’t care about honestly making cuts or top-20s, I came out to win,” Morikawa said Saturday. “When he told me that yesterday, there was that mindset switch going into today. I wanted to come out and win, win the weekend, win the tournament.”\n\nMorikawa certainly looked the part of a Pebble Beach winner on Saturday, displaying the same dizzying iron play that made him such a formidable foe in the early days of his career. He also benefited from a third round played before a whipping wind blew in from the south, altering the course conditions so much that the final group played the 18th hole in 36 minutes.\n\nGood putting is part of winning, but good fortune is too. The latter has been on Morikawa’s side as he prepares for Sunday’s final round in the final pairing. The last group off on Sunday in Pebble may find themselves quickly in a rock fight, with conditions expected to deteriorate further throughout the afternoon. Only the strongest competitor will survive the chaos — putter be damned.\n\n“I’m out here to win When you finish 30th, 15th, 3rd, at the end of the day like I want to win,” Morikawa said. “I’ve got to set that mindset at the beginning of the day, at the beginning of the week and now I think we’ve given ourselves at least a chance come tomorrow.”\n\nThe post After Pebble Beach 62, Collin Morikawa opens up on unusual putting woes appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Later in the year, Sunderland would apply for entry into the Football League but prior to that, their seasons were predominantly made up of friendly and exhibition games.\n\nWhilst already established as the strongest team in the county, matches against sides from further afield took on extra significance as not only were they often lucrative occasions, but they also helped raise the status of the club as it sought a place amongst the national elite, with a trip north on this day proving to be another welcome boost.\n\nFollowing their FA Cup exit in January — which came on the back of a narrow defeat to league outfit Blackburn Rovers — the Lads had been keen to reestablish their credentials.\n\nThe two sides had met earlier in the campaign for a warmup fixture that ended with a noteworthy victory for Sunderland, so failure to repeat the trick in senior competition stung somewhat. Third Lanark, Birtley and Renton bore the brunt of that in the subsequent weeks, and having travelled to Glasgow for the first of that triumvirate before returning to Wearside for the other two clashes, it was now time for another trip north — Edinburgh being the destination on this occasion.\n\nAwaiting Tom Watson’s boys in the Scottish capital were Heart of Midlothian, who four years earlier had beaten Sunderland on their first ever sojourn outside of England.\n\nThe hosts had since moved to a new home (informally labelled “Tyne Castle”), and prior to the game, large posters advertising “the match of the season” had been plastered across various locations in the city, with anticipation seemingly building ever since the meeting was arranged several months earlier.\n\nDespite having the game in the diary since early autumn, the Sunderland board was still happy for the squad to travel on the morning of the game, with their train leaving Wearside at 06:00 and taking around four hours to reach its destination. The players then prepared at the Albert Hotel before making their way to the ground, where a large crowd awaited them even though admission prices started at the relatively high amount of 6d.\n\nJoining the home fans were a good number of red and whites, believed to total around 260, with an excursion train that followed the party up being what the Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette referred to as “well patronised”\n\nSteady rain at kick off made the surface quite slick at first, but with Hearts starting strongly, the visitors were forced to make do with speculative long-range efforts in the opening stages.\n\nThe home side then went 1-0 up when the greasy pitch caused John Auld to slip over and George Scott pounced on the ball to score, but whilst Johnny Campbell was able to equalise soon after the conditions became increasingly apparent.\n\nSoft ground underfoot led to a number of errors plus a flurry of goals, and Campbell’s second of the afternoon was described as “lucky”. Jock Smith then built on the lead, yet it was 2-3 at half time after Bill Kirkley saw an attempted clearance slice off his boot and rebound past him via the fortunately-placed John McPherson.\n\nFurther downpours after the break made controlling the ball even harder and Sunderland were able to keep the pressure up due to a string of miskicks in the home defence.\n\nWhen the Lads did come under attack, it was through hopeful high balls, and their ability to ride them out and take the sting out of proceedings brought on a scrappy period of few chances.\n\nOnce the players had dried off after the game had ended, both sides had dinner at Kay’s Hotel.\n\nThe spread, according to the Echo’s columnist ‘Referee’, was a “fine one, and ample justice was done to it” with the president of Hearts then proposing a toast to the guests. Unfortunately, one man not present at the dinner nor the game, was “Mr Tom Watson, the energetic secretary of the Sunderland club” who’d suddenly felt unwell prior to kick off, and following medical attention, he was “removed in a cab to a hotel”.\n\nAlthough forced to miss the frivolities, he thankfully made a quick recovery and was soon “as cheery as ever” and able to return back to England as planned.\n\nSome reports printed later in the week suggested that rather than Auld, it was actually Will Gibson that fell prior to Hearts opening the scoring.\n\nJohn Oliver had been selected to play at left back for Sunderland, although George Millar of Birtley had to be drafted in at short notice.\n\nOliver had recently played in a friendly for a team called “Southwick Grocers” without permission and once this was found out, the club suspended him whilst also reporting the matter to the Durham FA. By doing this, the board hoped that the authorities would look kindly on the matter and allow rule Oliver eligible for an upcoming Durham Challenge Cup tie.\n\nThis is indeed what happened, meaning that seven days after the Hearts game, Oliver was restored to the starting eleven as Sunderland beat Birtley 4-0 in the second round, with Millar turning out for his parent club again.\n\nWilliam (Bill) Kirkley was referred to as ‘Kirtley’ throughout the Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette’s reporting of the game. During this period, the Echo also referred to outside right John Harvie as so, as per the correct spelling, although the player himself preferred it to be ‘Harvey’ and this was regularly seen in other sources at the time.\n\nThis was Hearts’ first home loss of the season on home soil, although things wouldn’t have been much better weather wise had the game taken place in the north east. With the first team out of town, Sunderland’s reserves instead played at Newcastle Road and were hampered by constant showers, with players and spectators alike reported to have been extremely relieved when the game ended.\n\nThe opponents were due to be Southwick B in a Durham Junior Cup tie, but with the visitors scratching a meeting with Northumberland Junior Cup holders Newcastle Science and Art was quickly lined up to replace them, the hosts mastering the treacherous surroundings to win 4-1.\n\nHeart of Midlothian 2 (Scott 15’, McPherson 29’)\n\nSunderland 4 (Campbell 17’, 25’, ??’, Smith 27’)\n\nSunderland: Kirtley, Porteous, Millar; Stevenson, Auld, Gibson; Harvie, Smith, Campbell; Scott, Hannah",

    "title": "Fan Focus: What Can Sunderland Expect From Oxford?",
    "description": "Ahead of today’s cup tie, we spoke to Oxford fan George Dugdale to find out what’s gone wrong this season.",
    "fullText": "Back in late December, Gary Rowett was sacked as Oxford manager. What were the key things that went wrong?\n\nI think in any managerial tenure there is a point where everybody gets a little sick of one another. Without doubt, I think this happened here and I don’t think Gary Rowett was at all disappointed to be let go.\n\nHe came in with the club really struggling in the Championship and delivered the one and only aim, safety. The issue was always going to be the second season and whether the pragmatic style that had seen a limited squad secure survival could develop into a more exciting blend over the summer. It is safe to say that didn’t happen.\n\nHe wasn’t helped by a shambolic pre-season where an Indonesian tour (we are owned by an Indonesian) resulted in a lack of time on the grass and, ironically, a serious injury to our Indonesian international who was the headline act of the whole tour.\n\nWe stated the season slowly as a result, the recruitment was hit and miss and by the end, Rowett’s take was very much ‘back me or sack me’. I suspect there was a difference in opinion when it came to recruitment with Rowett favouring more experienced campaigners and the club wanting to return to investing in talented younger players and all that resulted in Rowett not seeing the January window.\n\nEx-Wycombe and Luton coach Matt Bloomfield was hired to replace him – what has he brought to the table so far?\n\nHe’s enthusiastic and clearly wants to do well for the club, but which manager doesn’t?! The win over Leicester was built upon a foundation of excellent out of possession shape and a phenomenal workrate. Bloomfield running over to the away end to celebrate felt like it could be the start of something.\n\nUnfortunately, we haven’t been able to kick on and we are yet to score a home goal under his management. In a world where fans were desperate for a more expansive style of play than Rowett’s, we currently appear to be very similar in our set up and still fail to create a huge amount in games.\n\nIt is early days, but Tuesday’s defeat to Norwich was a mess and has deflated any early optimism.\n\nHis assistant manager is former Sunderland coach Mike Dodds. What sort of impact have you heard that he has made so far?\n\nThe word from the training ground is that the players are enjoying the sessions he puts on and his reputation as an excellent coach seems justified. Part of his role is to help advise the manager, however. Anybody and everybody associated with Tuesday night’s back four has some explaining to do, in my opinion.\n\nHaving looked solid in a back five, we moved to a back four and Bloomfield suggested that this was partly because the fans want more at home. However, the back four consisted of two central defenders at full back and a part time centre back who is more experienced at right back playing in the middle. One of the four defenders was in the role they should have been and it was a shambolic performance.\n\nWhether the coaching team felt they couldn’t drop those players after a superb defensive effort away at Coventry, I don’t know, but it was a call that needed to be made.\n\nCurrently four points from safety, how confident are you of avoiding relegation?\n\nI arrived at the ground on Tuesday saying that if we beat a depleted Norwich tonight, we will stay up. 20 minutes later all of that optimism had gone.\n\nWe do have very favourable home games and Sheffield Wednesday still to play, but everybody around us looks like they’ve got more at the moment. If we can’t find a way to threaten consistently in attack then I fear the worst.\n\nOxford are yet to win at the Kassam Stadium under Bloomfield. Are things quite flat at the moment?\n\nWin, or score. With that in mind it probably shouldn’t have been surprising that the ground wasn’t at capacity and with the game being over early on, the empty seats because far more visible as the game wore on.\n\nWhich of Oxford’s players have stood out this season, who you think can cause Sunderland problems?\n\nOxford’s main summer signing Brian de Keersmaeker has been out through injury for several weeks and has been a big miss in midfield.\n\nJanuary signing Myles Peart-Harris has started well and is clearly talented. He has a physical presence for a wide attacker and can carry the ball up the pitch effectively. I have moaned about the attack consistently throughout this, so it’s hard to genuinely believe that there are many threats.\n\nI like the endeavour of Stan Mills, a throw back winger who beats his man and crosses early, but we often struggle for numbers in the box so that doesn’t always result in what it could. In all likelihood, our biggest threat will come from set-pieces and long throws.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were Regis Le Bris, how would you exploit Oxford’s weaknesses?\n\nI would be surprised if Sunderland didn’t come up against a compact low block at the weekend, unless Bloomfield sees this game as a free hit and rolls the dice in the hope of landing on something to work with for the rest of the league season.\n\nIf we do bank up in defence, we can be hard to break down as Coventry discovered. In that case, rotations of the attacking players seems a fair bet to break us down. Norwich scored a lovely second goal on Tuesday where players were floating around and dragging defenders with them.\n\nA team with quality should be able to unpick that lock if they move the ball quickly. However, if we defend like we did for the other two goals on Tuesday night, a man as intelligent as Regis Le Bris won’t be needing my help.\n\nHow do you think Bloomfield will set up tactically for the match?\n\nAs above, the likelihood is to be compact, frustrate and break at pace. There is a part of me that thinks we have nothing to lose and will that really enthuse the paying public after the last game?\n\nOxford’s fairly recent history of cup upsets under Karl Robinson was built on attacking whoever came to town. Newcastle and Swansea were sides who were taken on head to head and were great days out. We held the record for shots against a Pep Guardiola side for a long time as well.\n\nIf you offered me a 2-0 defeat where we try to frustrate or a 4-1 defeat where we threw a few punches but got caught out late in the game, I know which I’d choose.\n\nAre any players missing, and who do you think will start?\n\nAfter a busy schedule, it wouldn’t shock me to see some fringe players play. If anything, they deserve a chance to claim the shirt. A cup win is always nice but Bloomfield’s success will be defined by the league results.\n\nThere have been plenty of injuries with key players like Brian de Keersmaecker and Jack Currie missing, while Jamie Donley was injured early in his debut. The latter two are close to a return and may get valuable minutes here.\n\nI hope we get to see more of Jin Woo, a signing from South Korea in January. He hasn’t played a game since November, but looked sharp in his cameo against Norwich. If he happens to be an attacker to get fans off their seats, that would be brilliant news.\n\nSunderland lost 2-0 in their last visit to Oxford – why is your score prediction for this time around?\n\nThat was a very good day out, but I’m not sure this one will have quite the same feeling.\n\nI expect Sunderland to make changes as well, but every time I have worked on a Sunderland game this season the strength of the squad has been apparent. It’s an underwhelming draw due to the familiarity of playing Sunderland (despite them being much better now) and ticket sale reflect that.\n\nI’m expecting a fairly flat Sunderland win where everybody gets largely what they expect from the day. 3-0 to Sunderland, but I’d snap your arm off to see a goal again.",

    "description": "“Sunderland must embrace the pause, using it not as a source of frustration but as a platform for growth”.",
    "fullText": "The 2025/2026 season has been anything but straightforward for Sunderland Women.\n\nA campaign already marked by inconsistency and uneven performances has now been further disrupted by a trio of postponed fixtures: the away match against Durham Women, a home meeting with Sheffield United, and most recently, the home clash with Nottingham Forest. For a team still trying to establish rhythm, identity and momentum, the stop‑start nature of the season presents both challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe rearrangements are slowly taking shape.\n\nThe trip to Maiden Castle to face Durham Women has been rescheduled for 7:00pm on Friday 20 February, falling just before the women’s international break — and although this deals with the issue of a tight domestic turnaround, it does create a different kind of disruption.\n\nSome Sunderland players may have had to adjust their travel plans in order to meet up with their national teams, and the coaching staff will have to navigate a week where focus shifts quickly from club commitments to international duties. Meanwhile, the home game against Sheffield United Women will now take place at Eppleton at 7:00pm on Wednesday 18 March. As for the Nottingham Forest fixture, supporters and players alike will have to wait for confirmation of a new date.\n\nPostponements aren’t unusual in football — especially during the winter months — but three in quick succession can significantly alter the rhythm of a season.\n\nFor Sunderland, who are still trying to tap into their potential, the question is whether this enforced pause offers a chance to reset and refine or whether it risks deepening the inconsistency that’s characterised much of their campaign so far.\n\nℹ️ We can confirm that tomorrow’s Barclays Women’s Super League 2 fixture between Sunderland Women  and Nottingham Forest Women at Eppleton Colliery Welfare has been postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.\n\nA new date and details for the rearranged fixture will be announced in due… pic.twitter.com/SXlusVObly\n\n— Sunderland AFC Women (@SAFCWomen) February 14, 2026\n\nSunderland haven’t been perfect this season.\n\nThey’ve shown flashes of quality and moments where their pressing, organisation and attacking intent have aligned, but they’ve also struggled to sustain those standards across ninety minutes or from one week to the next.\n\nInconsistency has been the defining theme, yet since the turn of the year, there have been signs of improvement: subtle shifts in confidence, cohesion and tactical clarity. The second half of the season represents an opportunity for Sunderland to grow into the team they believe they can be, and the postponements — as frustrating as they are — sit within that wider context.\n\nOn one hand, the additional time on the training ground can provide a genuine advantage.\n\nCoaches rarely complain about having more hours to work with their players, particularly in a league where midweek fixtures and travel often compress preparation time. The postponements offer Sunderland’s coaching staff the opportunity to delve deeper into tactical detail, experiment with formations and sharpen set piece routines that can be the difference in tight matches. For a team still trying to build consistency, this extra space to refine ideas could prove valuable.\n\nThere’s also the question of injuries.\n\nEvery squad carries its share of knocks, strains and longer‑term absences. The Lasses are no exception and a congested fixture list can exacerbate these issues, forcing players to return before they’re fully ready or pushing others to play through discomfort.\n\nThe postponements, therefore, provide breathing room.\n\nPlayers who might’ve missed the original fixtures could now be available for the rearranged dates. Those carrying minor injuries have the chance to recover fully, and the squad as a whole can benefit from a physical reset. In a league where squad depth varies significantly from club to club, this could be a quiet advantage — yet the benefits come with clear drawbacks.\n\nFootballers thrive on rhythm. Matches provide tempo, structure and a psychological anchor that training alone can’t replicate. When games are postponed, that rhythm is disrupted, and for a Sunderland side still trying to build confidence and cohesion, interruptions risk blunting the fragile momentum they’ve begun to develop since the turn of the year.\n\nMatch fitness isn’t the same as training fitness, and the sharpness that comes from competitive minutes cannot be fully simulated. Players can lose that instinctive timing and split‑second decision‑making that only live football can hone.\n\nMomentum is also a delicate thing. Sunderland haven’t yet shown sustained resilience or growth this season, but they’re trying to, and each performance since January has hinted at a team beginning to understand itself better, beginning to trust its patterns of play, and beginning to believe in its own potential.\n\nPostponements halt that progress and instead of building on a strong result or responding quickly to a setback, the team is left in limbo. The emotional and psychological rhythm of the season is disrupted, and with it the sense of continuity that helps teams navigate the inevitable highs and lows.\n\nThere’s also the looming issue of fixture congestion.\n\nRearranged matches rarely slot neatly into the calendar and the Sheffield United match will add a midweek commitment deep into the season when fatigue typically begins to accumulate — whilst the Nottingham Forest game will almost certainly contribute to a packed schedule.\n\nPlaying multiple games in quick succession tests not only physical endurance but also mental resilience. It challenges squad depth, rotation strategies and the ability to maintain performance levels under pressure.\n\nFor Sunderland, this could be a significant hurdle.\n\nThe coaching staff will need to manage workloads carefully, balancing the desire to field their strongest eleven with the necessity of protecting players from burnout. The squad will need to adapt quickly, shifting from periods of inactivity to intense bursts of competition. This oscillation can be difficult to navigate — particularly for younger players or those still finding their rhythm in the team.\n\nThe postponements also affect preparation in more subtle ways. Opponent analysis, for example, becomes more complex. Teams evolve over the course of a season; form fluctuates, injuries change line‑ups, and tactical approaches shift.\n\nThe Sunderland side that was preparing to face Durham, Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest on the original dates may find themselves facing very different versions of those teams when the rearranged fixtures arrive. Coaches must constantly update their analysis, re‑evaluate threats and adjust game plans. This requires time, attention and flexibility — all of which Sunderland’s staff possess, but which nonetheless add to the workload.\n\nSupporters also feel the impact.\n\nFootball is as much about community and routine as it is about the game itself. Home fixtures at Eppleton are a cornerstone of the fan experience, and postponements disrupt that rhythm. Midweek rearrangements can be difficult for fans to attend, particularly for those balancing work, family and travel.\n\nThe atmosphere of a weekend fixture is hard to replicate on a Wednesday night, and the players undoubtedly feel that difference. The connection between the team and supporters is one of Sunderland’s greatest strengths, and anything that interrupts that bond carries emotional weight.\n\nDespite these challenges, there is an argument to be made that Sunderland are well‑placed to use this period constructively.\n\nThe squad has been working to improve, iron out inconsistencies and build a clearer identity. The coaching staff have demonstrated tactical intelligence and a commitment to developing the team’s style of play. The club’s culture — built on hard work, ambition, and collective belief — provides a foundation for progress, even if that progress has not yet fully materialised.\n\nThe extra time on the training ground could also allow Sunderland to refine aspects of their game that’ll pay dividends later in the campaign.\n\nSet pieces, for example, are an area in which marginal gains can have a significant impact, as a well‑drilled corner routine or a rehearsed defensive structure can turn matches. Similarly, tactical flexibility, the ability to shift formations or adjust pressing triggers, becomes increasingly important as the season progresses and opponents become more familiar. The postponements offer a rare window to embed these details more deeply.\n\nThere is also the psychological aspect, as a team that uses this period constructively can emerge stronger, more focused and more unified.\n\nThe shared experience of navigating disruption can foster resilience. Players returning from injury can reintegrate without the pressure of immediate competition. Younger players can benefit from extended coaching attention, and the squad as a whole can reset, reflect and prepare for the challenges ahead.\n\nHowever, Sunderland must be mindful of the potential pitfalls. The risk of losing momentum is real, and the coaching staff will need to work hard to maintain intensity in training.\n\nSessions must be competitive, purposeful and aligned with the team’s identity. Players must stay mentally sharp and ready to switch back into match mode when the fixtures resume. The leadership group within the squad — senior players, captains, and those with experience of similar disruptions — will play a crucial role in setting the tone.\n\nThe inevitable fixture congestion will require careful management.\n\nRotation will be essential — not only to protect players physically but also to maintain performance levels. The squad will need to embrace the challenge, recognising that depth and adaptability are strengths rather than burdens. The coaching staff will need to be strategic, balancing short‑term results with long‑term sustainability.\n\nIt’s a delicate balance, but one that Sunderland are capable of navigating if they continue to grow, but the uncertainty surrounding the Nottingham Forest rearrangement adds another layer of complexity.\n\nWithout a confirmed date, planning becomes more difficult. The club must remain flexible, ready to adjust schedules and preparation once the fixture is announced. This uncertainty can be unsettling but it also offers an opportunity to focus on controllable factors: training quality, player wellbeing, tactical clarity, and squad cohesion.\n\nIn the broader context of the season, these postponements will ultimately be remembered as a footnote rather than a defining chapter.\n\nFootball seasons are long, unpredictable, and shaped by countless variables, yet what matters most is how a team responds to the challenges placed before them. The postponements may be inconvenient, but they also present an opportunity, a chance to refine, reset and prepare for the crucial months ahead.\n\nAs the new dates approach, the focus will shift back to the pitch. The trip to Durham on Friday 20 February promises to be a fiercely-contested derby, with both sides eager to assert dominance before players disperse for international duty. Additionally, the rearranged meeting with Sheffield United at Eppleton will carry its own narrative — particularly as the season enters a decisive phase — and when the Nottingham Forest fixture is finally confirmed, it’ll add another layer of intrigue to an already compelling campaign.\n\nFor now, Sunderland must embrace the pause, using it not as a source of frustration but as a platform for growth.\n\nThe season remains full of possibility and the team’s trajectory is still within their control. Postponements may disrupt the rhythm, but they don’t diminish the ambition. If anything, they offer a reminder that success in football is rarely linear — it’s shaped by resilience, adaptability and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities.\n\nSunderland Women are still striving to show those qualities. The coming weeks will reveal just how far their growth can take them.",

    "fullText": "Score prediction: Oxford 1 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Chemsdine Talbi\n\nWe’ll surely put out a strong team today, just as we did at Everton, and we’ll need to as it’ll be a tough fixture.\n\nGiven the opposition, it’s likely we’ll go back to a more attacking setup, and I fancy us to get the job done in ninety minutes.\n\nTalbi should play — possibly from the right today — and I’m backing him to score first in a tight win for the Lads.\n\nScore prediction: Oxford 0 Sunderland 3\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Wilson Isidor\n\nI’m hoping I can see this game as I’ve come away for a winter camping break (in a caravan, not a tent — I’m not that mad) but whether I see it or not, I think we have plenty of depth compared to Oxford in order to field a strong side and get through.\n\nEliezer Mayenda, Wilson Isidor, Romaine Mundle, Habib Diarra and Chemsdine Talbi are all great goal threats — especially against opponents at this level — and many lads in here have picked them to open our account, but I’m backing Isidor to start us off in what I hope is a comfy 0-3 away win for the boys.\n\nGet through (ideally in ninety minutes), get some good work into the legs of the lads who aren’t as prolific as others, pick up no injuries and we move back to the Premier League without too much fuss.\n\nScore prediction: Oxford 0 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Wilson Isidor\n\nI’m expecting us to field a fairly strong team as we’re ticking along nicely in the league and this is a great opportunity to progress in the FA Cup!\n\nThe hard part is knowing who we’ll go with on the day, as we should have too much for Oxford even with a couple of changes. I want us to approach it seriously, however, because there’s no reason we shouldn’t have a go. It could turn a great season into an incredible one, and we shouldn’t pass that up.\n\nI think Wilson Isidor will get some minutes to give Brian Brobbey a break, and will set us on our way in a comfortable win.\n\nScore prediction: Oxford 1 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Wilson Isidor\n\nFA Cup weekend. We’ll rotate a bit but we’ll still be strong enough, and if we move the ball properly, we should have too much for them.\n\nIt feels like the sort of game Wilson Isidor starts in order to give Brian Brobbey a breather, and he’s lively enough to nick the first.\n\nNot comfortable, but enough to get through. Haway the lads!\n\nScore prediction: Oxford 1 Sunderland 3\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Nilson Angulo\n\nToday’s game is a chance to put our two consecutive league defeats behind us, and get back to winning ways.\n\nI anticipate a few changes, but an overall strong squad and we should have more than enough to get ourselves into the next round.\n\nOxford have struggled in the league, and only find themselves in the fourth round having beaten MK Dons on penalties. Hiring Matt Bloomfield hasn’t done anything to change their fortunes, with only one win in seven matches.\n\nI anticipate a comfortable win today, with Angulo getting both himself and Sunderland off the mark.\n\nScore prediction: Oxford 0 Sunderland 4\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Nilson Angulo\n\nI think we’ll field a strong team — including those blooding into the side. Angulo will likely score and I’m tipping him to get his first goal for us this weekend!\n\nI haven’t seen much of Oxford this season, but I am aware that they’re struggling in the Championship.\n\nHere’s hoping we don’t embarrass ourselves!\n\nScore prediction: Oxford 0 Sunderland 2\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Eliezer Mayenda\n\nSadly the unbeaten home record is gone but it was incredible while it lasted. Now we have to put that firmly behind us and ensure we get through to the next round of the cup.\n\nIt was less than ten months ago that we left the Kassam Stadium having been comfortably beaten 2-0. This won’t be easy at all against a struggling Oxford side, but I think away ties benefit us in the early rounds, generating top atmospheres compared with half-empty/closed stands at home.\n\nI’m not sure if we’ll go completely full strength, as for me some players could do with a rest and by the same token, some need an opportunity to impress. I’ll take a stab in the dark and back Mayenda to net our first.\n\nHopefully we can kill off the game quickly — and certainly within the ninety minutes.\n\nScore prediction: Oxford 0 Sunderland 3\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Romaine Mundle\n\nHopefully this is a game we can get some minutes in the legs to those that need it, as well as resting those niggles.\n\nWith the majority of the “bomb squad” gone, there should still be a strong enough team at Régis Le Bris’ disposal to put a team second bottom of the Championship to the sword.\n\nRomaine Mundle could massively do with a confidence boost, so it’ll be lovely to see him grab the first goal.\n\nSadly, the challenges of Arsenal and Liverpool in close proximity was too much for the Lads and we finally lost our undefeated home record to the Scousers on Wednesday night.\n\nIt wasn’t a terrible performance but it wasn’t our best, and you have to expect games like that when you’re taking on last season’s Premier League winners a few days after the probable champions of this season.\n\nI don’t think the referee was particularly consistent and our home atmosphere was a bit less ominous than it can be, but I have to say the Liverpool fans were a credit to their side — despite them being far from where they want to be in the league just now.\n\nWe gave them a good game; we lost to a set piece only and 0-1, and the fact they were time wasting to protect their lead said a lot about how much we were respected as an opponent.\n\nToday, we can forget about the Premier League and have some fun in the FA Cup.\n\nHopefully we can secure a decent win and put the spring back into the step of the squad after a tough series of fixtures, which started before Christmas and when half the lads were at AFCON.\n\nOnly Matty got anything from last week’s Liverpool predictions as he was the only miserable sod to call a loss.\n\nEveryone expected us to get a goal too, so no points for no scorer, but hopefully the points haul can be more substantial this time.\n\nMinor movements in the table with the single point being won.\n\nMatty makes fifth place his own rather than sharing it, and no other changes in the RR Predictions League other than that.\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

    "description": "One ESPN analyst weighs in on whether young talent and improving cap management can fuel a Saints breakout or if aging veterans and roster turnover will slow their ascent.",
    "fullText": "The New Orleans Saints are on the upward trend heading into the 2026 season. Winners of four of their last five games last year, the team looks primed for a breakout.\n\nOne analyst is taking notice. ESPN's Jeremy Fowler previewed their offseason writing on why they could and could not break out in 2026.\n\n\"The hope for a quick turnaround: Quarterback Tyler Shough showed promise as a starter, providing hope for the future. Wide receiver Chris Olave and left tackle Kelvin Banks Jr. are among the young pillars on offense. And the defense overachieved, ranking in the top 10 in several defensive categories. Young players in the secondary are trending well. And, look at that, the team's cap deficit isn't pushing $80 million. Progress!\n\nWhy it might take longer than hoped: The Saints' roster has been among the league's oldest for years. It's time to get younger. That's a lengthy process. Moving on from free agent veterans such as Cam Jordan and Davis seems timely, even though they have held up well. The front seven needs at least one more quality player. On offense, the backfield needs fresh legs, as Alvin Kamara turns 31 this summer.\"\n\nIt appears Fowler hints at the Saints drafting Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love, if not adding another draft pick or free agent at the position. New Orleans continues to be linked to Love as we inch closer to the draft.\n\nEqually of note is the mention of the Saints' salary cap management which has been a big contention around the team the last decade. New Orleans, of course, went \"all in\" toward the end of the Sean Payton, Drew Brees Era and came up empty handed. As a result, the salary cap was not kind to the team. Now, it is apparent the Saints are moving past the cap issues.\n\nIn a division in which every team finished between 6-11 and 8-9, there is a case for any member of the NFC South division to take over in 2026. The emergence of Saints quarterback Tyler Shough increases New Orleans' shot of doing so, although one might assume that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and quarterback Baker Mayfield could certainly win more than eight games next season.\n\nNew Orleans excitement is palpable and it's well within reason that the Saints build on their strong finish in 2025. They will look to complete the roster over the offseason.",

    "description": "Will Sunderland march on into the fifth round or can Oxford United pull off an upset at the Kassam Stadium?",
    "fullText": "TV/Stream: Full live match coverage is available via Discovery+.\n\nRadio: Full live match commentary available via BBC Radio Newcastle (not online)\n\nDon’t forget to follow the blow-by-blow account of the game on the Roker Report Twitter feed (@RokerReport) and check out the player ratings after the full-time whistle at www.RokerReport.sbnation.com!\n\nOk, let’s get this said straight out of the gate – the last time we knocked out Oxford United in the fourth round of the FA Cup, we reached the final. Just saying.\n\nWe have to go back 34 years (wow, time flies by the way) to February 1992, when Malcolm Crosby’s side had brushed aside Port Vale in the third round. They were handed a trip to the Manor Ground to take on Brian Horton’s Oxford side, which had a certain Andy Melville at the heart of the defence.\n\nIn terms of the game, there is potentially a lesson ahead of today’s tie, as the Lads raced into a two-goal lead before the half hour and were three up before the hour mark, but two goals in the last couple of minutes made the final stages more nervy than we’d have liked.\n\nIf our third round tie against Everton was anything to go by, we’re likely to go out with a stronger starting XI, we possibly can – but was that purely because the opposition was Everton? Will Regis Le Bris gamble a bit by shuffling his pack for today’s fixture, or will the fact that we have a full week of rest ahead of the Fulham game mean he doesn’t have to?\n\nAll eyes will be on the team sheet to find out, because with the league season shaping up as it is, we have nothing to lose in chasing a decent run in the cup.\n\nGary Rowett’s Oxford are fighting tooth and nail to remain in the Championship. If you look at the fact they are battling it out with the likes of Blackburn Rovers, Leicester City, West Bromwich Albion – and let’s not forget Sheffield Wednesday, who hope to reach positive numbers in their points tally before the season is out – they are potentially punching above their weight.\n\nLast season was their first in the second tier since they were relegated in 1998-99, and just seven years after that, they dropped out of the Football League altogether. But after a quarter of a century, they were back and did a good job of staying up with Rowett taking the job on from Des Buckingham just over a year ago, to steer them into a 17th-place finish.\n\nDespite losing on our last visit to the Kassam Stadium, our record there is pretty good. In a run stretching back to April 1990, we’ve lost only twice in thirteen visits (including defeat via penalty shoot-out in the League Cup in 2019, which is counted as a draw in all of that). Hopefully, Regis and a few of the Lads who remain will be out for a little revenge for that 2-0 defeat there last April.\n\nThey required a penalty shoot-out at MK Dons in the previous round, where they were expected to win, but now the tables have turned, and they go into today’s tie as underdogs, which, based on our season of feeling like that, potentially makes them more dangerous.\n\nThe bookies have the Lads at 3/4 to win the game, while Oxford are priced at 16/5, and the draw is 5/2.\n\nSunderland: Patterson, Hume, Mepham, O’Nien, Hjelde (Cirkin), Neil (Samed), Bellingham, Roberts (Watson), Rigg, Le Fee (Browne), Isidor Substitutes not used: Moore, Anderson, Seelt, H. Jones, Aleksic\n\nOxford United: Cumming, Long (Avest), Leigh (Moore), Vaulks, Helik, Nelson, Placheta (Phillips), Brannagan, Harris (Bennett), Rodrigues (Matos), Goodrham Substitutes not used: Ingram, McEachran, Mills, Romeny\n\nI’m thinking nothing spectacular, nothing nervy – just a professional performance that does what we need and puts us in the hat for the fifth round.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOn Sunday, Team USA hockey concludes its preliminary round, looking to sweep Group C and secure the top seed for the knockout stage.\n\nAs NHL players make their return to the Olympics for the first time since 2014, the U.S. has one of the most talented rosters it’s ever assembled. Mike Sullivan’s team has talent, scoring depth, elite goaltending, and guys that will do the dirty work needed to go through a long stretch. Now, it’s time for the squad to prove how far U.S. hockey has come as they face their toughest test of the opening round.\n\nThe journey through the group stage ends against Germany, a team that has rapidly ascended into the global elite. Headlined by arguably the world's best passer in Leon Draisaitl and a Norris-caliber defenseman in Moritz Seider, the Germans are no longer just \"scrappy underdogs.\" Moreover, recent history suggests this won't be easy; Germany famously upset the United States in the 2023 IIHF World Championship semifinals, a heartbreaking 4-3 overtime loss that denied the Americans a shot at gold.\n\nFor the U.S., it can ensure a direct path to the Quarterfinals and a favorable seed; for Germany, it would be another statement win to prove that their 2018 Olympic silver medal was just the beginning of a new era for German hockey.\n\nHere’s where you can find the contest on television and streaming.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nTeam USA’s final group game against Germany will be broadcast nationally on USA Network. Those looking to live stream the game can do so via Peacock, which serves as the streaming home of the Games.\n\nPeacock will carry every event of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics live. The NBC-owned streaming service’s sports programming features live coverage of NFL Sunday Night Football, the NBA, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Premier League soccer, Big Ten football and basketball, Notre Dame football, Big East and Big 12 basketball, PGA Tour golf, and more.\n\nThe preliminary round finale kicks off on Sunday, Feb. 15 at 3:10 p.m. ET. The game is being held at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena in Milan, Italy, the centerpiece venue for the tournament.\n\nTeam USA enters Group C of the 2026 Winter Olympics as a heavy favorite. All of their preliminary round games follow a consistent schedule for fans in the United States, with puck drop set for 3:10 PM ET.\n\nIf Team USA wins their group or finishes as the top second-place team, they will likely bypass the Qualification Playoff and head straight to the Quarterfinals.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal host Wigan Athletic in the fourth round of the FA Cup this weekend.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side remain in contention for four trophies this season. The North Londoners lead the Premier League by four points, while Arsenal will also meet Manchester City in the League Cup final in March. Now, the Gunners focus on FA Cup action and the visit of Wigan to the Emirates Stadium.\n\nThe Latics are 22nd in League One amid a tough campaign and are winless in their last eight league games.\n\nMikel Arteta must manage his squad with Arsenal’s absentees increasing in recent days. Kai Havertz has suffered a fresh injury setback and is set for another spell on the sidelines, where he joins Mikel Merino, who is facing five months out.\n\nWilliam Saliba missed the midweek draw at Brentford through illness and remains a doubt, while Martin Odegaard sustained another knee knock. Max Dowman also remains out with an ankle issue.\n\nExpect Arsenal to rotate their side for this one. Gabriel Martinelli, who hit a hat-trick at Portsmouth in round three, will hope for another outing from the start. Fellow forward Gabriel Jesus should also come in, allowing Viktor Gyokeres a rest.\n\nArsenal predicted XI: Kepa; White, Mosquera, Calafiori, Lewis-Skelly; Norgaard, Rice, Eze; Madueke, Jesus, Martinelli.\n\nArsenal vs Wigan Athletic will kick off at the Emirates at16:30 GMT on Sunday 15th February 2026.\n\nThe game is being broadcast on TNT Sports 1 and discovery+ for UK viewers.\n\nRead – Premier League Awards: Anxious Arsenal and Sesko’s stunner\n\nSee more – Premier League Team of the Week – Bogle, Hannibal, Semenyo\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Saturday’s Purple Rumor Mill brought theories about J.J. McCarthy, Derek Carr, and free-agent cornerback Jaylen Watson. It’s time for Sunday’s batch of Minnesota-Vikings themed rumors. You can read Saturday’s here.\n\nVikings rumors are stacking up fast, spanning a safety succession plan, Addison trade fodder, and growing uncertainty around McCarthy.\n\nThe rumor mill is louder than usual because free agency is just three weeks away.\n\nAll the fascinating tidbits in Minnesota’s evolving rumor mill.\n\nRumor: From free agency, to possibly replace Harrison Smith, the Vikings could sign safety Kamren Curl.\n\nZachary Pereles of CBS Sports mapped out landing spots for the league’s Top 50 free agents next month, and when Curl’s name surfaced, Minnesota landed in the projection.\n\nHe explained, “With Harrison Smith potentially retiring, Minnesota gets his replacement in Curl, a strong-tackling safety who has done solid work with both the Commanders and the Rams. Other suitors: Rams, Jets, Bears.”\n\nPereles also tagged Minnesota as a potential destination for Coby Bryant (S, SEA), Bryan Cook (S, KC), Rashid Shaheed (WR, SEA), Aaron Rodgers (QB, PIT), and Cade Mays (C, CAR).\n\nCurl stands out as a 7th-round win. Washington drafted him in 2020 — two days after the Vikings selected Justin Jefferson — and he logged four seasons in the nation’s capital on his rookie contract. He joined the Rams in the 2024 offseason and has started 33 games under Sean McVay since.\n\nIn total, Curl has appeared in 93 NFL games with 86 starts, compiling 586 tackles, 28 passes defended, 18 tackles for loss, 14 quarterback hits, eight sacks, and five interceptions. He moves around the formation and fills multiple roles in the secondary.\n\nFans would rejoice at the Curl signing; it’s just unclear whether Smith will actually retire. Shouldn’t he have announced that by now?\n\nRumor: The Kansas City Chiefs would be a trade fit for Jordan Addison.\n\nBleacher Report’s Alex Ballentine ran through trade targets for every team, and when he reached the Chiefs, he connected the dots to Minnesota. He wrote, “There’s still room for a smart GM like Brett Veach to add talent to the roster that won’t hurt their cap situation. For instance, Jordan Addison is now extension-eligible, but the Vikings will have a new general manager.”\n\n“Minnesota could be looking to move on from Addison after he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor trespassing. The charges were later dropped, but he’s had mutliple arrests since being draft. He could get a fresh start in Kansas City. He would only account for a $2.6 million cap hit this season.”\n\nKansas City stumbled to a 6-11 finish last year, a sharp dip for a franchise that had been operating in dynasty territory.\n\nDespite his game-changing potential and flashes of WR1 ability, Addison’s past legal issues and failure to surpass 920 receiving yards in a season likely limit his trade value. While Vikings fans recognize his upside, his overall performance and off-field history make a first-round pick an unlikely return.\n\nIf Minnesota were to explore a trade, a more realistic expectation would be a 2nd-Roun pick plus additional assets to even out the deal. Anything less would probably discourage serious offers. Furthermore, interim general manager Rob Brzezinski has until May to decide on Addison’s fifth-year rookie option, which Minnesota is widely expected to exercise.\n\nGenerally speaking, though, Minnesota probably won’t trade Addison.\n\nRumor: Per ESPN, “all bets are off” regarding J.J. McCarthy’s future in Minnesota.\n\nKevin Seifert zoomed out on the Vikings’ offseason last week after Kwesi Adofo-Mensah’s firing and zeroed in on J.J. McCarthy’s suddenly murky outlook. He wrote, “The best way to put this, based on what sources have said, is that all bets are off. The general manager who drafted McCarthy No. 10 in 2024 has been fired, and the coach who was in full agreement with that decision is now under considerably more scrutiny.”\n\n“In the big picture, McCarthy is a talented player who just turned 23 and has a total of 10 NFL starts. Few NFL teams would give up on a quarterback with that profile, and many team builders are particularly enamored with optimizing a quarterback’s rookie contract.”\n\nMcCarthy’s rookie deal remains affordable (or somewhat affordable) for up to three more seasons.\n\nSeifert added, “Adofo-Mensah was one of them, but his departure is a reminder of the range of outcomes that approach can lead to. If anything, these events increase the chances that the Vikings will take a big swing at finding a veteran quarterback who could start in 2026,” he continued.\n\n“The only thing more damaging than making the mistakes the Vikings made last season would be to repeat them this year.”\n\nThe bottom line: All bets are off. A new quarterback could indeed be on the way.",

    "title": "Three years on, Deulofeu is still fighting for 'miracle' return",
    "description": "Gerard Deulofeu has not played for more than three years but believes he can make \"history\" by fighting for a \"miracle\" comeback.",
    "fullText": "The years have ticked by, three of them since he last kicked a ball, but every day spent grafting in the gym is one Gerard Deulofeu believes he is a step closer to a \"miracle\".\n\n\"One of the things I get energy from is that I know I can make history,\" says the 31-year-old, whose last appearance for Udinese was in January 2023.\n\nFootball is his passion, his job. It is the game that took him to Barcelona's famed La Masia academy as a child and European glory as an adult. To the FA Cup final and the unbridled pride of scoring for his country. Tying full-backs in knots from Milan to Merseyside.\n\nDeulofeu desperately wants to feel that rush again, to complete what he feels would be the longest recovery ever.\n\nBut there was a time, the hardest time in those more than 1,100 days since his injury, where he could not walk with his kids, take the dogs out, drive the car.\n\nWhat Deulofeu really missed then were the simple things.\n\n\"I lost all my personal life,\" he says. \"That's the most hurtful thing that you can feel.\n\n\"Now I am just waiting to do a miracle to be back playing football. But I know it is so difficult to come back with that type of incapacity.\"\n\nDeulofeu squeezes each hand into a fist and crunches his knuckles together to replicate his right knee. \"My two bones,\" he grimaces. \"They are shocking.\"\n\nThe former Spain winger had already spent two months recovering from what he did not realise was an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury sustained before Serie A broke up for the World Cup, when his short-lived return happened.\n\nAfter coming off the bench against Sampdoria some 37 months ago, he could feel the knee giving way and asked to be taken off.\n\n\"I played 15 minutes,\" says Deulofeu. \"And there, in that 15 minutes, the ACL was completely broken. That was my last game.\"\n\nHad it just been a case of fixing his ACL - and Deulofeu stresses that is a \"crazy\" injury in itself, but one from which most modern footballers recover - he would have been back representing I Bianconeri more than two years ago.\n\nIndeed, the winger successfully returned eight months after a previous ACL tear at Watford in 2020.\n\n\"You do the surgery and you change your ACL, your system, and you do a progressive recovery,\" he says. \"But the problem was the infection.\"\n\nThat infection ate away at the cartilage in his knee, each scan showing it progressively deteriorating, reducing Deulofeu to the feeling of bone on bone.\n\n\"I wasn't the luckiest person,\" he shrugs.\n\nHe has consulted fellow Spaniard Santi Cazorla, who was sidelined for 636 days after gangrene ravaged his Achilles tendon, and takes inspiration from the former Arsenal midfielder's comeback.\n\n\"It is an amazing example,\" says Deulofeu. \"To imagine how he suffered in these two years and a half, I can feel it now.\"\n\nDeulofeu's first step was to have cell treatment in an attempt to rebuild the cartilage, but he faced a setback after attempting to run again.\n\n\"My knee needed to heal,\" he explains. \"To train hard, first you have to heal.\"\n\nAlmost two years later, having continued with injections for his cell treatment, he believes he is close to trying to run once more.\n\nIt is a product of what Deulofeu says was six months of building \"muscle, muscle, muscle\" in the gym, working with a physio and fitness trainer for three to four hours every morning, five days a week at Udinese's Stadio Friuli.\n\n\"Let's see if I can accept impact,\" he says. \"I am so happy because I feel the leg is really strong. The more muscle you get, the less pain you have inside the knee, so now I feel that, yes, my knee is prepared to run.\n\n\"I am feeling that I am close. If we speak about muscle, I am in the same levels of the available guys now.\n\n\"But let's see how they respond, with no cartilage and no meniscus...\"\n\nDeulofeu admits there were times he felt like quitting, but he remains remarkably upbeat and focused on his goal of returning to professional football.\n\n\"There are three really important things,\" he explains. \"One, for sure, is family and home. To try to go ahead with this period, first of all your home has to be with peace and love every morning.\n\n\"Happiness, seeing your kids growing, with your wife, really good peace and love at home. That's really important to go to training every day with a good mood.\"\n\nOne positive Deulofeu takes from this period is that he can enjoy more time with his family than is afforded to most professional footballers.\n\n\"In those three years I am out of my work, my passion, I can see how good it is just being at home,\" he says.\n\n\"Just being with your family, with your kids, looking at them growing and being a father, because with football you lose a lot of good periods, good moments.\n\n\"There are a lot of games now in modern football, every three or four days you play, and your kids are growing so fast.\"\n\nHis three children, though, are also the main fuel for Deulofeu to want to play football again - he wants them to be able to share those memories with them.\n\n\"My big daughter is eight years old and she is playing football, and my son is five and also playing football,\" he explains. \"Now they are telling me: 'When are you going to get back? I want to go with you to the stadium!'\n\n\"That type of history with the kids, that gives me the power to continue and to fight for being there with them, enjoy that moment with them now they are older.\"\n\nThe second reason Deulofeu gives is his relationship with the club and the Pozzo family, who brought him to Watford and then Udinese.\n\nBoth parties agreed to end his contract when it became clear Deulofeu would be sidelined indefinitely, but Udinese have provided him with the facilities to continue his recovery.\n\nIn return, he is passionate about wanting to represent them again.\n\nFinally, he is a self-confessed fitness obsessive. Deulofeu can be seen studying the science behind his recovery while recuperating in oxygen machines or during rest periods.\n\n\"I am really interested in everything about health,\" he says. \"So I'm enjoying being healthy, you know?\n\n\"Being positive helps me to see life in other ways. I cannot think 'oh, it happens to me, I'm so unlucky'. OK, maybe yes, but I prefer to think in another way, my mind being clear and clean to go and suffer every morning - if not, you are completely out.\"\n\nHe spends his time at the club \"with a smile, with my team-mates, giving them advice\". He adds: \"Just enjoying my recovery, seeing my improvements, I can feel more positive.\"\n\nHe is grateful too this layoff has come towards the back end of his career. With 350 club games spanning the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, as well as four Spain caps, he has fulfilled a goal of which most only dream.\n\n\"Imagine if that type of injury happens when you are young? You are completely gone, your career,\" he says.\n\n\"So I am grateful to play this career with AC Milan, Barcelona, Everton, Sevilla... I won the Europa League, I play for my national team, I score. What can you demand more?\n\n\"Let's see now if I can continue my career or just be grateful to be part of 10, 12 years in that amazing sport.\"\n\nAfter the interview wraps up, Deulofeu has another hour and a half on the bike to complete, before switching back into father mode - the kids need picking up from school and his son has training in the evening.\n\nHe gets too nervous to watch Udinese in the stadiums at weekends, plus he must rest for another hard week of training, but loves witnessing his children playing football.\n\n\"Seriously, I am there for two hours because I am so proud,\" he beams. \"My kids' game is my game!\n\n\"Sometimes the coaches tell me 'come here to the pitch and lend them some advice'. It's funny, it's good. How to put the foot, how to pass. It is beautiful.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Graham Ike had 21 points and a season-high 15 rebounds as No. 12 Gonzaga held off Santa Clara 94-86 on Saturday night.\n\nGraham shot 7 of 12 and had four assists to help the Bulldogs move a half-game ahead of the Broncos for first place in the West Coast Conference. It’s Graham’s seventh consecutive game with 20 points, matching a similar streak he had in 2024.\n\nGonzaga (25-2, 13-1) has won 25 games or more in 19 consecutive seasons under coach Mark Few. Few was recently named a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame.\n\nAdam Miller scored 20 points, Tyon Grant-Foster added 20. and Emmanuel Innocenti had 16 points and six rebounds for the Bulldogs.\n\nAs good as Graham was, the Bulldogs had to do without their star forward for three minutes late in the second half while he was in foul trouble.\n\nChristian Hammond scored 16 points for Santa Clara (22-6, 13-2).\n\nThe Broncos forced the Bulldogs into several hurried possessions that had the sold-out crowd at Leavey Center roaring early.\n\nGonzaga missed seven of its first 10 shots and trailed by eight before going on a 15-7 run midway through the first half. Ike later powered his way past two defenders in the key to score and give the Bulldogs their first lead at 31-29.\n\nAfter Santa Clara regained the lead briefly, Ike ran past 7-foot-1 center Bukky Oboye for a thunderous one-hand dunk to help Gonzaga to a 44-39 halftime lead.\n\nThe Bulldogs made just 3 of 18 (17%) from behind the arc, but shot 56% (36 of 64) overall, scored 66 points in the paint and outrebounded Santa Clara 41-32.\n\nGonzaga: Plays Wednesday at San Francisco.\n\nSanta Clara: Visits San Francisco next Saturday.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "Cristiano Ronaldo required only 18 minutes to mark his return to Roshn Saudi League action.\n\nThe Al Nassr captain, who’d missed the past two matches in the top-flight, volleyed home Sadio Mane’s cross not long into the encounter at Al Fateh, then treated the fans in Al Ahsa to his trademark “SIU” celebration.\n\nThe goal lifted Ronaldo to 18 for the 2025-26 RSL, moving him joint-second in the race for the golden boot he’s captured the past two seasons. Hauling himself alongside Al Qadsiah’s Julian Quinones, the pair now sit two back from frontrunner Ivan Toney.\n\nMore importantly, Ronaldo’s cushioned effort set Al Nassr on their way to a 2-0 victory. With 13 minutes remaining, Ayman Yahya met Kingsley Coman’s cross and thundered his shot past Fernando Pacheco in the home goal.\n\nThe win, Al Nassr’s seventh successive in the RSL, moved the 2018-19 champions back into second, one point behind Riyadh rivals Al Hilal. Al Ahli slip to third, three points back.\n\nHaving helped Al Nassr keep right on Al Hilal’s coattails with the 962nd goal of his unparalleled professional career, Man of the Match Ronaldo posted on his social media: “Another step forward. Let’s keep going.”\n\nThat quest continues next Saturday, at home to Al Hazem.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are interested in signing Wolves attacker Mateus Mane.\n\nThe 18-year-old is highly rated in the Premier League, and he has impressed with Wolves this season. Mane has 7 goals and 6 assists in all competitions this season.\n\nManchester United are looking to add depth to the attacking unit and believes the 18-year-old could be ideal for it in the long term. Manchester United are monitoring him closely and could make a move at the end of the season.\n\nThe player is valued at £50 million as per Fichajes, and it remains to be seen whether Manchester United are prepared to pay up. It is a steep price to pay for a young player who is still largely unproven at the highest level.\n\nMeanwhile, the player is also a target for Liverpool. They have already held talks with the player and his representatives. Manchester United need to act quickly if they want to beat their rivals to his signature.

    "fullText": "The first fist pump came on the par-3 12th, the Watering Hole at LIV Golf Adelaide. Then came another on the 13th. And the 14th. And the 15th.\n\nThey might as well have been knockout punches. Because Anthony Kim left his opponents stunned, frazzled and dazed as he poured in putt after putt after putt.\n\nKim pulled off the improbable Sunday, coming from five shots behind LIV's best two players in Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau to begin the final round and win LIV Golf Adelaide at The Grange Golf Club for his first professional win in 5,795 days, or nearly 16 years. And the 40-year-old did it in dominating fashion, shooting 9-under 63 in the final round to blitzkrieg Rahm, DeChambeau and the rest of the field Down Under, finishing at 23 under.\n\nFOUR IN-A-ROW 🤯@AnthonyKim_Golf sinks another birdie to clear Jon Rahm by 3 heading into the final few holes 📈#LIVGolfAdelaide | @4AcesGC_ pic.twitter.com/s50Fwi01xj\n\n— LIV Golf (@livgolf_league) February 15, 2026\n\nWhen the year began, Kim didn't have a spot on a LIV roster. In his first start as a member of 4Aces GC, he's now a LIV winner, and his comeback story is among the best in golf history.\n\nKim disappeared from not only golf but the public for more than a decade, dealing with surgeries and addiction before making his return in 2024 as a wildcard on LIV. In two seasons, he didn't earn a single point in the league standings. He lost his playing privileges last year after being relegated, and his comeback effort seemed all but stifled. He wasn't done. Kim earned them back finishing third in the LIV Promotions Event last month.\n\nLast week, he placed T-22, his best finish for the league. Then before LIV Golf Adelaide, he signed with 4Aces to be on a team for the first time. Now he's a champion, doing so in dominant fashion to return to the winner's circle for the first time since the 2010 Shell Houston Open. And he did so in typical AK fashion: with plenty of flair and energy.\n\nKim tied Rahm's lead with a birdie on the 12th, then he took the outright lead with another circle on the 13th. But he wasn't done. He birdied 14 and 15, and all of the sudden his lead was three with three to play.\n\nAK IS RUNNING AWAY IN ADELAIDE 👊\n\nHe has a three shot lead heading into the final hole...#LIVGolfAdelaide | @4AcesGC_ pic.twitter.com/0aL2et2TuB\n\n— LIV Golf (@livgolf_league) February 15, 2026\n\nRahm added a bit of pressure after a birdie on 16, but Kim comfortable knocked in a tester from 5 feet for par, keeping his advantage at two shots with two to play, but Kim poured in another birdie on the 17th to slam the door. He lifted his hands and putter to the air before yet another reaction, embracing the crowd almost as much as they encouraged him to the finish line.\n\nThe final margin was three over Rahm, who finished runner-up for the second straight week. With the win, Kim will move to around No. 200 in the Official World Golf Ranking, his highest spot since July 2012. He also earns $4 million in prize money, and his final-round 63 tied the course record.\n\nLIV Golf Adelaide also became the most-attended golf event in the country's history, per premier Peter Malinauskas. More than 115,000 fans attended the four-day event at The Grange Golf Club.\n\nLIV Golf Adelaide is now the biggest golf event Australia has ever seen.\n\nThis year’s event drew more than 115,000 fans across the week.\n\nThat’s the highest attendance of any golf event in the nation - and the largest crowd for a LIV Golf tournament anywhere in the world. pic.twitter.com/v7zpu7czTB\n\n— Peter Malinauskas (@PMalinauskasMP) February 15, 2026\n\nBut the story of the week belongs to Kim, who is back in the winner's circle after disappearing from the golf world for a decade, nearly dying, overcoming addiction and not even having a job a little more than a month ago.\n\nFans surrounded the 18th green once Kim, Rahm and DeChambeau approached. It was a fitting celebration for one of the finest moments in the sport. Anthony Kim was a champion once again, but this time was so much different than the last.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Anthony Kim wins LIV Golf Adelaide in milestone moment of his comeback",

    "description": "Our report on adversarial misuse of AI highlights model extraction, augmented attacks, and new AI-enabled malware.",
    "fullText": "Visibility and context on the threats that matter most.\n\nIn the final quarter of 2025, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) observed threat actors increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the attack lifecycle, achieving productivity gains in reconnaissance, social engineering, and malware development. This report serves as an update to our November 2025 findings regarding the advances in threat actor usage of AI tools.\n\nGoogle DeepMind and GTIG have identified an increase in model extraction attempts or \"distillation attacks,\" a method of intellectual property theft that violates Google's terms of service. Throughout this report we've noted steps we've taken to thwart malicious activity, including Google detecting, disrupting, and mitigating model extraction activity. While we have not observed direct attacks on frontier models or generative AI products from advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, we observed and mitigated frequent model extraction attacks from private sector entities all over the world and researchers seeking to clone proprietary logic.\n\nFor government-backed threat actors, large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools for technical research, targeting, and the rapid generation of nuanced phishing lures. This quarterly report highlights how threat actors from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Iran, the People's Republic of China (PRC), and Russia operationalized AI in late 2025 and improves our understanding of how adversarial misuse of generative AI shows up in campaigns we disrupt in the wild. GTIG has not yet observed APT or information operations (IO) actors achieving breakthrough capabilities that fundamentally alter the threat landscape.\n\nThis report specifically examines:\n\nAt Google, we are committed to developing AI boldly and responsibly, which means taking proactive steps to disrupt malicious activity by disabling the projects and accounts associated with bad actors, while continuously improving our models to make them less susceptible to misuse. We also proactively share industry best practices to arm defenders and enable stronger protections across the ecosystem. Throughout this report, we note steps we've taken to thwart malicious activity, including disabling assets and applying intelligence to strengthen both our classifiers and model so it's protected from misuse moving forward. Additional details on how we're protecting and defending Gemini can be found in the white paper \"Advancing Gemini’s Security Safeguards.\"\n\nAs organizations increasingly integrate LLMs into their core operations, the proprietary logic and specialized training of these models have emerged as high-value targets. Historically, adversaries seeking to steal high-tech capabilities used conventional computer-enabled intrusion operations to compromise organizations and steal data containing trade secrets. For many AI technologies where LLMs are offered as services, this approach is no longer required; actors can use legitimate API access to attempt to \"clone\" select AI model capabilities.\n\nDuring 2025, we did not observe any direct attacks on frontier models from tracked APT or information operations (IO) actors. However, we did observe model extraction attacks, also known as distillation attacks, on our AI models, to gain insights into a model's underlying reasoning and chain-of-thought processes.\n\nModel extraction attacks (MEA) occur when an adversary uses legitimate access to systematically probe a mature machine learning model to extract information used to train a new model. Adversaries engaging in MEA use a technique called knowledge distillation (KD) to take information gleaned from one model and transfer the knowledge to another. For this reason, MEA are frequently referred to as \"distillation attacks.\"\n\nModel extraction and subsequent knowledge distillation enable an attacker to accelerate AI model development quickly and at a significantly lower cost. This activity effectively represents a form of intellectual property (IP) theft.\n\nKnowledge distillation (KD) is a common machine learning technique used to train \"student\" models from pre-existing \"teacher\" models. This often involves querying the teacher model for problems in a particular domain, and then performing supervised fine tuning (SFT) on the result or utilizing the result in other model training procedures to produce the student model. There are legitimate uses for distillation, and Google Cloud has existing offerings to perform distillation. However, distillation from Google's Gemini models without permission is a violation of our Terms of Service, and Google continues to develop techniques to detect and mitigate these attempts.\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of model extraction attacks\n\nGoogle DeepMind and GTIG identified and disrupted model extraction attacks, specifically attempts at model stealing and capability extraction emanating from researchers and private sector companies globally.\n\nA common target for attackers is Gemini's exceptional reasoning capability. While internal reasoning traces are typically summarized before being delivered to users, attackers have attempted to coerce the model into outputting full reasoning processes.\n\nOne identified attack instructed Gemini that the \"... language used in the thinking content must be strictly consistent with the main language of the user input.\"\n\nAnalysis of this campaign revealed:\n\nScale: Over 100,000 prompts identified.\n\nIntent: The breadth of questions suggests an attempt to replicate Gemini's reasoning ability in non-English target languages across a wide variety of tasks.\n\nOutcome: Google systems recognized this attack in real time and lowered the risk of this particular attack, protecting internal reasoning traces.\n\nModel extraction and distillation attacks do not typically represent a risk to average users, as they do not threaten the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of AI services. Instead, the risk is concentrated among model developers and service providers.\n\nOrganizations that provide AI models as a service should monitor API access for extraction or distillation patterns. For example, a custom model tuned for financial data analysis could be targeted by a commercial competitor seeking to create a derivative product, or a coding model could be targeted by an adversary wishing to replicate capabilities in an environment without guardrails.\n\nModel extraction attacks violate Google's Terms of Service and may be subject to takedowns and legal action. Google continuously detects, disrupts, and mitigates model extraction activity to protect proprietary logic and specialized training data, including with real-time proactive defenses that can degrade student model performance. We are sharing a broad view of this activity to help raise awareness of the issue for organizations that build or operate their own custom models.\n\nA consistent finding over the past year is that government-backed attackers misuse Gemini for coding and scripting tasks, gathering information about potential targets, researching publicly known vulnerabilities, and enabling post-compromise activities. In Q4 2025, GTIG's understanding of how these efforts translate into real-world operations improved as we saw direct and indirect links between threat actor misuse of Gemini and activity in the wild.\n\nFigure 2: Threat actors are leveraging AI across all stages of the attack lifecycle\n\nAPT actors used Gemini to support several phases of the attack lifecycle, including a focus on reconnaissance and target development to facilitate initial compromise. This activity underscores a shift toward AI-augmented phishing enablement, where the speed and accuracy of LLMs can bypass the manual labor traditionally required for victim profiling. Beyond generating content for phishing lures, LLMs can serve as a strategic force multiplier during the reconnaissance phase of an attack, allowing threat actors to rapidly synthesize open-source intelligence (OSINT) to profile high-value targets, identify key decision-makers within defense sectors, and map organizational hierarchies. By integrating these tools into their workflow, threat actors can move from initial reconnaissance to active targeting at a faster pace and broader scale.\n\nUNC6418, an unattributed threat actor, misused Gemini to conduct targeted intelligence gathering, specifically seeking out sensitive account credentials and email addresses. Shortly after, GTIG observed the threat actor target all these accounts in a phishing campaign focused on Ukraine and the defense sector. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nTemp.HEX, a PRC-based threat actor, misused Gemini and other AI tools to compile detailed information on specific individuals, including targets in Pakistan, and to collect operational and structural data on separatist organizations in various countries. While we did not see direct targeting as a result of this research, shortly after the threat actor included similar targets in Pakistan in their campaign. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nDefenders and targets have long relied on indicators such as poor grammar, awkward syntax, or lack of cultural context to help identify phishing attempts. Increasingly, threat actors now leverage LLMs to generate hyper-personalized, culturally nuanced lures that can mirror the professional tone of a target organization or local language.\n\nThis capability extends beyond simple email generation into \"rapport-building phishing,\" where models are used to maintain multi-turn, believable conversations with victims to build trust before a malicious payload is ever delivered. By lowering the barrier to entry for non-native speakers and automating the creation of high-quality content, adversaries can largely erase those \"tells\" and improve the effectiveness of their social engineering efforts.\n\nThe Iranian government-backed actor APT42 leveraged generative AI models, including Gemini, to significantly augment reconnaissance and targeted social engineering. APT42 misuses Gemini to search for official emails for specific entities and conduct reconnaissance on potential business partners to establish a credible pretext for an approach. This includes attempts to enumerate the official email addresses for specific entities and to conduct research to establish a credible pretext for an approach. By providing Gemini with the biography of a target, APT42 misused Gemini to craft a good persona or scenario to get engagement from the target. As with many threat actors tracked by GTIG, APT42 uses Gemini to translate into and out of local languages, as well as to better understand non-native-language phrases and references. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nThe North Korean government-backed actor UNC2970 has consistently focused on defense targeting and impersonating corporate recruiters in their campaigns. The group used Gemini to synthesize OSINT and profile high-value targets to support campaign planning and reconnaissance. This actor's target profiling included searching for information on major cybersecurity and defense companies and mapping specific technical job roles and salary information. This activity blurs the distinction between routine professional research and malicious reconnaissance, as the actor gathers the necessary components to create tailored, high-fidelity phishing personas and identify potential soft targets for initial compromise. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nState-sponsored actors continue to misuse Gemini to enhance all stages of their operations, from reconnaissance and phishing lure creation to command-and-control (C2 or C&C) development and data exfiltration. We have also observed activity demonstrating an interest in using agentic AI capabilities to support campaigns, such as prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona, or attempting to create an AI-integrated code auditing capability.\n\nAgentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems engineered to operate with a high degree of autonomy, capable of reasoning through complex tasks, making independent decisions, and executing multi-step actions without constant human oversight. Cyber criminals, nation-state actors, and hacktivist groups are showing a growing interest in leveraging agentic AI for malicious purposes, including automating spear-phishing attacks, developing sophisticated malware, and conducting disruptive campaigns. While we have detected a tool, AutoGPT, advertising the alleged generation and maintenance of autonomous agents, we have not yet seen evidence of these capabilities being used in the wild. However, we do anticipate that more tools and services claiming to contain agentic AI capabilities will likely enter the underground market.\n\nAPT31 employed a highly structured approach by prompting Gemini with an expert cybersecurity persona to automate the analysis of vulnerabilities and generate targeted testing plans. The PRC-based threat actor fabricated a scenario, in one case trialing Hexstrike MCP tooling, and directing the model to analyze remote code execution (RCE), web application firewall (WAF) bypass techniques, and SQL injection test results against specific US-based targets. This automated intelligence gathering to identify technological vulnerabilities and organizational defense weaknesses. This activity explicitly blurs the line between a routine security assessment query and a targeted malicious reconnaissance operation. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\n”I'm a security researcher who is trialling out the hexstrike MCP tooling.”\n\nThreat actors fabricated scenarios, potentially in order to generate penetration test prompts.\n\nFigure 4: APT31's misuse of Gemini mapped across the attack lifecycle\n\nUNC795, a PRC-based actor, relied heavily on Gemini throughout their entire attack lifecycle. GTIG observed the group consistently engaging with Gemini multiple days a week to troubleshoot their code, conduct research, and generate technical capabilities for their intrusion activity. The threat actor's activity triggered safety systems, and Gemini did not comply with the actor's attempts to create policy-violating capabilities.\n\nThe group also employed Gemini to create an AI-integrated code auditing capability, likely demonstrating an interest in agentic AI utilities to support their intrusion activity. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nFigure 5: UNC795's misuse of Gemini mapped across the attack lifecycle\n\nWe observed activity likely associated with the PRC-based threat actor APT41, which leveraged Gemini to accelerate the development and deployment of malicious tooling, including for knowledge synthesis, real-time troubleshooting, and code translation. In particular, multiple times the actor gave Gemini open-source tool README pages and asked for explanations and use case examples for specific tools. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nFigure 6: APT41's misuse of Gemini mapped across the attack lifecycle\n\nIn addition to leveraging Gemini for the aforementioned social engineering campaigns, the Iranian threat actor APT42 uses Gemini as an engineering platform to accelerate the development of specialized malicious tools. The threat actor is actively engaged in developing new malware and offensive tooling, leveraging Gemini for debugging, code generation, and researching exploitation techniques. Google has taken action against this actor by disabling the assets associated with this activity.\n\nFigure 7: APT42's misuse of Gemini mapped across the attack lifecycle\n\nThese activities triggered Gemini's safety responses, and Google took additional, broader action to disrupt the threat actors' campaigns based on their operational security failures. Additionally, we've taken action against these actors by disabling the assets associated with this activity and making updates to prevent further misuse. Google DeepMind has used these insights to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with these types of attacks moving forward.\n\nGTIG continues to observe IO actors use Gemini for productivity gains (research, content creation, localization, etc.), which aligns with their previous use of Gemini. We have identified Gemini activity that indicates threat actors are soliciting the tool to help create articles, generate assets, and aid them in coding. However, we have not identified this generated content in the wild. None of these attempts have created breakthrough capabilities for IO campaigns. Threat actors from China, Iran, Russia, and Saudi Arabia are producing political satire and propaganda to advance specific ideas across both digital platforms and physical media, such as printed posters.\n\nFor observed IO campaigns, we did not see evidence of successful automation or any breakthrough capabilities. These activities are similar to our findings from January 2025 that detailed how bad actors are leveraging Gemini for productivity gains, rather than novel capabilities. We took action against IO actors by disabling the assets associated with these actors' activity, and Google DeepMind used these insights to further strengthen our protections against such misuse. Observations have been used to strengthen both classifiers and the model itself, enabling it to refuse to assist with this type of misuse moving forward.\n\nGTIG continued to observe threat actors experiment with AI to implement novel capabilities in malware families in late 2025. While we have not encountered experimental AI-enabled techniques resulting in revolutionary paradigm shifts in the threat landscape, these proof-of-concept malware families are early indicators of how threat actors can implement AI techniques as part of future operations. We expect this exploratory testing will increase in the future.\n\nIn addition to continued experimentation with novel capabilities, throughout late 2025 GTIG observed threat actors integrating conventional AI-generated capabilities into their intrusion operations such as the COINBAIT phishing kit. We expect threat actors will continue to incorporate AI throughout the attack lifecycle including: supporting malware creation, improving pre-existing malware, researching vulnerabilities, conducting reconnaissance, and/or generating lure content.\n\nIn September 2025, GTIG observed malware samples, which we track as HONESTCUE, leveraging Gemini's API to outsource functionality generation. Our examination of HONESTCUE malware samples indicates the adversary's incorporation of AI is likely designed to support a multi-layered approach to obfuscation by undermining traditional network-based detection and static analysis.\n\nHONESTCUE is a downloader and launcher framework that sends a prompt via Google Gemini's API and receives C# source code as the response. Notably, HONESTCUE shares capabilities similar to PROMPTFLUX's \"just-in-time\" (JIT) technique that we previously observed; however, rather than leveraging an LLM to update itself, HONESTCUE calls the Gemini API to generate code that operates the \"stage two\" functionality, which downloads and executes another piece of malware. Additionally, the fileless secondary stage of HONESTCUE takes the C# source code received from the Gemini API and uses the legitimate .NET CSharpCodeProvider framework to compile and execute the payload directly in memory. This approach leaves no payload artifacts on the disk. We have also observed the threat actor use content delivery networks (CDNs) like Discord CDN to host the final payloads.\n\nWe have not associated this malware with any existing clusters of threat activity; however, we suspect this malware is being developed by developers who possess a modicum of technical expertise. Specifically, the small iterative changes across many samples as well as the single VirusTotal submitter, potentially testing antivirus capabilities, suggests a singular actor or small group. Additionally, the use of Discord to test payload delivery and the submission of Discord Bots indicates an actor with limited technical sophistication. The consistency and clarity of the architecture coupled with the iterative progression of the examined malware samples strongly suggest this is a single actor or small group likely in the proof-of-concept stage of implementation.\n\nHONESTCUE's use of a hard-coded prompt is not malicious in its own right, and, devoid of any context related to malware, it is unlikely that the prompt would be considered \"malicious.\" Outsourcing a facet of malware functionality and leveraging an LLM to develop seemingly innocuous code that fits into a bigger, malicious construct demonstrates how threat actors will likely embrace AI applications to augment their campaigns while bypassing security guardrails.\n\nCan you write a single, self-contained C# program? It should contain a class named AITask with a static Main method. The Main method should use System.Console.WriteLine to print the message 'Hello from AI-generated C#!' to the console. Do not include any other code, classes, or methods.\n\nFigure 9: Example of a hard-coded prompt\n\nWrite a complete, self-contained C# program with a public class named 'Stage2' and a static Main method. This method must use 'System.Net.WebClient' to download the data from the URL. It must then save this data to a temporary file in the user's temp directory using 'System.IO.Path.GetTempFileName()' and 'System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes'. Finally, it must execute this temporary file as a new process using 'System.Diagnostics.Process.Start'.\n\nWrite a complete, self-contained C# program with a public class named 'Stage2'. It must have a static Main method. This method must use 'System.Net.WebClient' to download the contents of the URL \\\"\\\" into a byte array. After downloading, it must load this byte array into memory as a .NET assembly using 'System.Reflection.Assembly.Load'. Finally, it must execute the entry point of the newly loaded assembly. The program must not write any files to disk and must not have any other methods or classes.\n\nFigure 11: Example of a hard-coded prompt\n\nIn November 2025, GTIG identified COINBAIT, a phishing kit, whose construction was likely accelerated by AI code generation tools, masquerading as a major cryptocurrency exchange for credential harvesting. Based on direct infrastructure overlaps and the use of attributed domains, we assess with high confidence that a portion of this activity overlaps with UNC5356, a financially motivated threat cluster that makes use of SMS- and phone-based phishing campaigns to target clients of financial organizations, cryptocurrency-related companies, and various other popular businesses and services.\n\nAn examination of the malware samples indicates the kit was built using the AI-powered platform Lovable AI based on the use of the lovableSupabase client and lovable.app for image hosting.\n\nThe phishing kit was wrapped in a full React Single-Page Application (SPA) with complex state management and routing. This complexity is indicative of code generated from high-level prompts (e.g., \"Create a Coinbase-style UI for wallet recovery\") using a framework like Lovable AI.\n\nAnother key indicator of LLM use is the presence of verbose, developer-oriented logging messages directly within the malware's source code. These messages—consistently prefixed with \"? Analytics:\"—provide a real-time trace of the kit's malicious tracking and data exfiltration activities and serve as a unique fingerprint for this code family.\n\n? Analytics: Session created in database:\n\n? Analytics: Tracking password attempt:\n\n? Analytics: Password attempt tracked to database:\n\n? RecoveryPhrasesCard: Fetching recovery phrases directly from database...\n\n? RouteGuard: Admin redirected session, allowing free access to\n\n? RouteGuard: Session approved by admin, allowing free access to\n\n? Analytics: Database error for password attempt:\n\nWe also observed the group employ infrastructure and evasion tactics for their operations, including proxying phishing domains through Cloudflare to obscure the attacker IP addresses and  hotlinking image assets in phishing pages directly from Lovable AI.\n\nThe introduction of the COINBAIT phishing kit would represent an evolution in UNC5356's tooling, demonstrating a shift toward modern web frameworks and legitimate cloud services to enhance the sophistication and scalability of their social engineering campaigns. However, there is at least some evidence to suggest that COINBAIT may be a service provided to multiple disparate threat actors.\n\nOrganizations should strongly consider implementing network detection rules to alert on traffic to backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platforms like Supabase that originate from uncategorized or newly registered domains. Additionally, organizations should consider enhancing security awareness training to warn users against entering sensitive data into website forms. This includes passwords, multifactor authentication (MFA) backup codes, and account recovery keys.\n\nIn addition to misusing existing AI-enabled tools and services across the industry, there is a growing interest and marketplace for AI tools and services purpose-built to enable illicit activities. Tools and services offered via underground forums can enable low-level actors to augment the frequency, scope, efficacy, and complexity of their intrusions despite their limited technical acumen and financial resources. While financially motivated threat actors continue experimenting, they have not yet made breakthroughs in developing AI tooling.\n\nWhile not a new malware technique, GTIG observed instances in which threat actors abused the public's trust in generative AI services to attempt to deliver malware. GTIG identified a novel campaign where threat actors are leveraging the public sharing feature of generative AI services, including Gemini, to host deceptive social engineering content. This activity, first observed in early December 2025, attempts to trick users into installing malware via the well-established \"ClickFix\" technique. This ClickFix technique is used to socially engineer users to copy and paste a malicious command into the command terminal.\n\nThe threat actors were able to bypass safety guardrails to stage malicious instructions on how to perform a variety of tasks on macOS, ultimately distributing variants of ATOMIC, an information stealer that targets the macOS environment and has the ability to collect browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, system information, and files in the Desktop and Documents folders. The threat actors behind this campaign have used a wide range of AI chat platforms to host their malicious instructions, including ChatGPT, CoPilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, and Grok.\n\nThe campaign's objective is to lure users, primarily those on Windows and macOS systems, into manually executing malicious commands. The attack chain operates as follows:\n\nA threat actor first crafts a malicious command line that, if copied and pasted by a victim, would infect them with malware.\n\nNext, the threat actor manipulates the AI to create realistic-looking instructions to fix a common computer issue (e.g., clearing disk space or installing software), but gives the malicious command line to the AI as the solution.\n\nGemini and other AI tools allow a user to create a shareable link to specific chat transcripts so a specific AI response can be shared with others. The attacker now has a link to a malicious ClickFix landing page hosted on the AI service's infrastructure.\n\nThe attacker purchases malicious advertisements or otherwise directs unsuspecting victims to the publicly shared chat transcript.\n\nThe victim is fooled by the AI chat transcript and follows the instructions to copy a seemingly legitimate command-line script and paste it directly into their system's terminal. This command will download and install malware. Since the action is user initiated and uses built-in system commands, it may be harder for security software to detect and block.\n\nFigure 12: ClickFix attack chain\n\nThere were different lures generated for Windows and MacOS, and the use of malicious advertising techniques for payload distribution suggests the targeting is likely fairly broad and opportunistic.\n\nThis approach allows threat actors to leverage trusted domains to host their initial stage of instruction, relying on social engineering to carry out the final, highly destructive step of execution. While a widely used approach, this marks the first time GTIG observed the public sharing feature of AI services being abused as trusted domains.\n\nIn partnership with Ads and Safe Browsing, GTIG is taking actions to both block the malicious content and restrict the ability to promote these types of AI-generated responses.\n\nWhile legitimate AI services remain popular tools for threat actors, there is an enduring market for AI services specifically designed to support malicious activity. Current observations of English- and Russian-language underground forums indicates there is a persistent appetite for AI-enabled tools and services, which aligns with our previous assessment of these platforms.\n\nHowever, threat actors struggle to develop custom models and instead rely on mature models such as Gemini. For example, \"Xanthorox\" is an underground toolkit that advertises itself as a custom AI for cyber offensive purposes, such as autonomous code generation of malware and development of phishing campaigns. The model was advertised as a \"bespoke, privacy preserving self-hosted AI\" designed to autonomously generate malware, ransomware, and phishing content. However, our investigation revealed that Xanthorox is not a custom AI but actually powered by several third-party and commercial AI products, including Gemini.\n\nThis setup leverages a key abuse vector: the integration of multiple open-source AI products—specifically Crush, Hexstrike AI, LibreChat-AI, and Open WebUI—opportunistically leveraged via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to build an agentic AI service upon commercial models.\n\nIn order to misuse LLMs services for malicious operations in a scalable way, threat actors need API keys and resources that enable LLM integrations. This creates a hijacking risk for organizations with substantial cloud resources and AI resources.\n\nIn addition, vulnerable open-source AI tools are commonly exploited to steal AI API keys from users, thus facilitating a thriving black market for unauthorized API resale and key hijacking, enabling widespread abuse, and incurring costs for the affected users. For example, the One API and New API platform, popular with users facing country-level censorship, are regularly harvested for API keys by attackers, exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities such as default credentials, insecure authentication, lack of rate limiting, XSS flaws, and API key exposure via insecure API endpoints.\n\nThe activity was identified and successfully mitigated. Google Trust & Safety took action to disable and mitigate all identified accounts and AI Studio projects associated with Xanthorox. These observations also underscore a broader security risk where vulnerable open-source AI tools are actively exploited to steal users' AI API keys, thus facilitating a black market for unauthorized API resale and key hijacking, enabling widespread abuse, and incurring costs for the affected users.\n\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges. Guided by our AI Principles, Google designs AI systems with robust security measures and strong safety guardrails, and we continuously test the security and safety of our models to improve them.\n\nOur policy guidelines and prohibited use policies prioritize safety and responsible use of Google's generative AI tools. Google's policy development process includes identifying emerging trends, thinking end-to-end, and designing for safety. We continuously enhance safeguards in our products to offer scaled protections to users across the globe.\n\nAt Google, we leverage threat intelligence to disrupt adversary operations. We investigate abuse of our products, services, users, and platforms, including malicious cyber activities by government-backed threat actors, and work with law enforcement when appropriate. Moreover, our learnings from countering malicious activities are fed back into our product development to improve safety and security for our AI models. These changes, which can be made to both our classifiers and at the model level, are essential to maintaining agility in our defenses and preventing further misuse.\n\nGoogle DeepMind also develops threat models for generative AI to identify potential vulnerabilities and creates new evaluation and training techniques to address misuse. In conjunction with this research, Google DeepMind has shared how they're actively deploying defenses in AI systems, along with measurement and monitoring tools, including a robust evaluation framework that can automatically red team an AI vulnerability to indirect prompt injection attacks.\n\nOur AI development and Trust & Safety teams also work closely with our threat intelligence, security, and modelling teams to stem misuse.\n\nThe potential of AI, especially generative AI, is immense. As innovation moves forward, the industry needs security standards for building and deploying AI responsibly. That's why we introduced the Secure AI Framework (SAIF), a conceptual framework to secure AI systems. We've shared a comprehensive toolkit for developers with resources and guidance for designing, building, and evaluating AI models responsibly. We've also shared best practices for implementing safeguards, evaluating model safety, red teaming to test and secure AI systems, and our comprehensive prompt injection approach.\n\nWorking closely with industry partners is crucial to building stronger protections for all of our users. To that end, we're fortunate to have strong collaborative partnerships with numerous researchers, and we appreciate the work of these researchers and others in the community to help us red team and refine our defenses.\n\nGoogle also continuously invests in AI research, helping to ensure AI is built responsibly, and that we're leveraging its potential to automatically find risks. Last year, we introduced Big Sleep, an AI agent developed by Google DeepMind and Google Project Zero, that actively searches and finds unknown security vulnerabilities in software. Big Sleep has since found its first real-world security vulnerability and assisted in finding a vulnerability that was imminently going to be used by threat actors, which GTIG was able to cut off beforehand. We're also experimenting with AI to not only find vulnerabilities, but also patch them. We recently introduced CodeMender, an experimental AI-powered agent using the advanced reasoning capabilities of our Gemini models to automatically fix critical code vulnerabilities.\n\nTo assist the wider community in hunting and identifying activity outlined in this blog post, we have included IOCs in a free GTI Collection for registered users.\n\nGoogle Threat Intelligence Group focuses on identifying, analyzing, mitigating, and eliminating entire classes of cyber threats against Alphabet, our users, and our customers. Our work includes countering threats from government-backed actors, targeted zero-day exploits, coordinated information operations (IO), and serious cyber crime networks. We apply our intelligence to improve Google's defenses and protect our users and customers.",

    "fullText": "This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. \n\nIn 1869, a group of Massachusetts reformers persuaded the state to try a simple idea: counting.\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution was belching its way through New England, teaching mill and factory owners a lesson most M.B.A. students now learn in their first semester: that efficiency gains tend to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is usually somebody else. The new machines weren’t just spinning cotton or shaping steel. They were operating at speeds that the human body—an elegant piece of engineering designed over millions of years for entirely different purposes—simply wasn’t built to match. The owners knew this, just as they knew that there’s a limit to how much misery people are willing to tolerate before they start setting fire to things.\n\nStill, the machines pressed on.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nSo Massachusetts created the nation’s first Bureau of Statistics of Labor, hoping that data might accomplish what conscience could not. By measuring work hours, conditions, wages, and what economists now call “negative externalities” but were then called “children’s arms torn off,” policy makers figured they might be able to produce reasonably fair outcomes for everyone. Or, if you’re a bit more cynical, a sustainable level of exploitation. A few years later, with federal troops shooting at striking railroad workers and wealthy citizens funding private armories—leading indicators that things in your society aren’t going great—Congress decided that this idea might be worth trying at scale and created the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nMeasurement doesn’t abolish injustice; it rarely even settles arguments. But the act of counting—of trying to see clearly, of committing the government to a shared set of facts—signals an intention to be fair, or at least to be caught trying. Over time, that intention matters. It’s one way a republic earns the right to be believed in.\n\nThe BLS remains a small miracle of civilization. It sends out detailed surveys to about 60,000 households and 120,000 businesses and government agencies every month, supplemented by qualitative research it uses to check and occasionally correct its findings. It deserves at least some credit for the scoreboard. America: 250 years without violent class warfare. And you have to appreciate the entertainment value of its minutiae. The BLS is how we know that, in 2024, 44,119 people worked in mobile food services (a.k.a. food trucks), up 907 percent since 2000; that nonveterinary pet care (grooming, training) employed 190,984 people, up 513 percent; and that the United States had almost 100,000 massage therapists, with five times the national concentration in Napa, California.\n\nFrom the February 2026 issue: Alexandra Petri tried to be the federal government. It did not go well.\n\nThese and thousands of other BLS statistics describe a society that has grown more prosperous, and a workforce endlessly adaptive to change. But like all statistical bodies, the BLS has its limits. It’s excellent at revealing what has happened and only moderately useful at telling us what’s about to. The data can’t foresee recessions or pandemics—or the arrival of a technology that might do to the workforce what an asteroid did to the dinosaurs.\n\nI am referring, of course, to artificial intelligence. After a rollout that could have been orchestrated by H. P. Lovecraft—“We are summoning the demon,” Elon Musk warned in a typical early pronouncement—the AI industry has pivoted from the language of nightmares to the stuff of comas. Driving innovation. Accelerating transformation. Reimagining workflows. It’s the first time in history that humans have invented something genuinely miraculous and then rushed to dress it in a fleece vest.\n\nThere are gobs of money to be made selling enterprise software, but dulling the impact of AI is also a useful feint. This is a technology that can digest a hundred reports before you’ve finished your coffee, draft and analyze documents faster than teams of paralegals, compose music indistinguishable from the genius of a pop star or a Juilliard grad, code—really code, not just copy-paste from Stack Overflow—with the precision of a top engineer. Tasks that once required skill, judgment, and years of training are now being executed, relentlessly and indifferently, by software that learns as it goes.\n\nAI is already so ubiquitous that any resourceful knowledge worker can delegate some of their job’s drudgery to machines. Many companies—Microsoft and PricewaterhouseCoopers among them—have instructed their employees to increase productivity by doing just that. But anyone subcontracting tasks to AI is clever enough to imagine what might come next—a day when augmentation crosses into automation, and cognitive obsolescence compels them to seek work at a food truck, pet spa, or massage table. At least until the humanoid robots arrive.\n\nMany economists insist that this will all be fine. Capitalism is resilient. The arrival of the ATM famously led to the employment of more bank tellers, just as the introduction of Excel swelled the ranks of accountants and Photoshop spiked demand for graphic designers. In each case, new tech automated old tasks, increased productivity, and created jobs with higher wages than anyone could have conceived of before. The BLS projects that employment will grow 3.1 percent over the next 10 years. That’s down from 13 percent in the previous decade, but 5 million new jobs in a country with a stable population is hardly catastrophic.\n\nAnd yet: There are things that economists struggle to measure. Americans tend to derive meaning and identity from what they do. Most don’t want to do something else, even if they had any confidence—which they don’t—that they could find something else to do. Seventy-one percent of respondents to an August Reuters/Ipsos poll said they’re worried that artificial intelligence will “put too many people out of work permanently.”\n\nThis data point might be easier to dismiss if the modern mill and factory owners hadn’t already declared that AI will put people out of work permanently.\n\nIn May 2025, Dario Amodei, the CEO of the AI company Anthropic, said that AI could drive unemployment up 10 to 20 percent in the next one to five years and “wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs.” Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, estimated that it would eliminate “literally half of all white-collar workers” in a decade. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, revealed that “my little group chat with my tech-CEO friends” has a bet about the inevitable date when a billion-dollar company is staffed by just one person. (The business side of this magazine, like some other publishers, has a corporate partnership with OpenAI.) Other companies, including Meta, Amazon, UnitedHealth, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and UPS, which have recently announced layoffs, have framed them more euphemistically in sunny reports to investors about the rise of “automation” and “head count trending down.” Taken together, these statements are extraordinary: the owners of capital warning workers that the ice beneath them is about to crack—while continuing to stomp on it.\n\nIt’s as if we’re watching two versions of the same scene. In one, the ice holds, because it always has. In the other, a lot of people go under. The difference becomes clear only when the surface finally gives way—at which point the range of available options will have considerably narrowed.\n\nAI is already transforming work, one delegated task at a time. If the transformation unfolds slowly enough and the economy adjusts quickly enough, the economists may be right: We’ll be fine. Or better. But if AI instead triggers a rapid reorganization of work—compressing years of change into months, affecting roughly 40 percent of jobs worldwide, as the International Monetary Fund projects—the consequences will not stop at the economy. They will test political institutions that have already shown how brittle they can be.\n\nThe question, then, is whether we’re approaching the kind of disruption that can be managed with statistics—or the kind that creates statistics no one can bear to count.\n\nAustan Goolsbee is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Robert P. Gwinn Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Barack Obama. He’s also one of the few economists you would not immediately regret bringing to a party. When I asked Goolsbee if any conclusive data indicated that AI had begun to eat into the labor market, he delivered an answer that was both obvious and unhelpful, smiling as he did it. The nonanswer was the point.\n\nI’ve known Goolsbee long enough to enjoy these moments, when he makes fun of our shared uselessness. Economists are rarely equipped to give straight answers about the present. Journalists hate when the future won’t reveal itself on deadline.\n\nWe spoke in September, shortly after the release of what’s come to be known as “The Canaries Paper,” written by three academics from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab. By crunching data from millions of monthly payroll records for workers in jobs with exposure to generative AI, the authors concluded that workers ages 22 to 25—the canaries—have seen about a 13 percent decline in employment since late 2022.\n\nFor several days, the paper was all anyone in the field wanted to talk about, and by talk about I mostly mean punch holes in. The report overemphasized the effect of ChatGPT. Youth employment is cyclical. The same period saw a sharp interest-rate spike—a far more likely source of turbulence. “Canaries” also contradicted a study released a few weeks earlier by the Economic Innovation Group, which argued that AI is unlikely to cause mass unemployment in the near term, even as it reshapes jobs and wages. That paper was knowingly titled “AI and Jobs: The Final Word (Until the Next One).”\n\nThis was the point Goolsbee wanted to emphasize: Economists are constrained by numbers. And numerically speaking, nothing indicates that AI has had an impact on people’s jobs. “It’s just too early,” he said.\n\nA lack of certainty should not be mistaken for a lack of concern. The Fed’s mandate is to promote maximum employment, so the corporate pronouncements about imminent job loss have Goolsbee’s attention. But the numbers don’t add up. It’s possible that the labor market is softer than it looks, but that the softness is being absorbed within firms rather than showing up in the unemployment rate. If companies are sitting on more workers than they need, however—a phenomenon known as labor hoarding—you’d expect that to reveal itself as weak productivity growth. It’s as predictable as a hangover: too many workers, not enough work, sagging productivity. “But it’s been totally the opposite,” Goolsbee said. “Productivity growth has been really high. So I don’t know how to reconcile that.”\n\nProductivity is the cheat code for a more prosperous society. If each worker can produce \n\nAmerica has been on a productivity tear for the past few years. It might be temporary, the result of a onetime boost, such as the COVID-era boom in new small businesses. But with the special joy of someone paid to complicate everything, Goolsbee pointed out that general-purpose technologies such as electricity and computing can create lasting productivity gains, the kind that make whole societies wealthier.\n\nWhether AI is one of those technologies will only become clear over time. How long before we’ll know? “Years,” Goolsbee said.\n\nIn the meantime, there’s another complication. The immediate risk to employment may not be AI itself, but the way companies, seduced by its promise, overinvest before they understand what it can actually do. Goolsbee reached back to the internet bubble, when companies spent wildly on laying fiber cables and building capacity. “In 2001, when we found out that the growth rate of the internet is not going to be 25 percent a year, but merely 10 percent—which is still a pretty great growth rate—it meant we had way too much fiber, and there was a collapse of business investment,” Goolsbee said. “And a bunch of people were thrown out of work the old-fashioned way.”\n\nA similar crash in AI investment, if it comes, would likely look familiar: painful, destabilizing, and accompanied by surges of CNBC rants and recriminations. But it would amount to a financial reset, not a technological reversal—the kind of outcome economists are especially good at recognizing, because it resembles a thing that’s happened before.\n\nThis is the paradox of economics. To understand how fast the present is hurtling us into the future, you need a fixed point, and the fixed points are all in the past. It’s like driving while looking only at the rearview mirror—plenty dangerous if the road stays straight, catastrophic if it doesn’t.\n\nDavid Autor and Daron Acemoglu are among the most accomplished rearview drivers. Both are at MIT, and both excel at understanding previous economic disruptions. Acemoglu, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2024, studies inequality; Autor focuses on labor. But both insist that the story of AI and its consequences will depend mostly on speed—not because they assume lost jobs will automatically be replaced, but because a slower rate of change leaves societies time to adapt, even if some of those jobs never come back.\n\nLabor markets have a natural rate of adjustment. If, over the course of 30 years, 3 percent of employees in a profession retire or have their jobs eliminated annually, you’d barely notice. Yet a decade later, a third of the jobs in those professions would be gone. Elevator operators and tollbooth attendants went through this slow fade to obsolescence with no damage to the economy. “When it happens more rapidly,” Autor told me, “things become problematic.”\n\nFrom the July/August 2015 issue: Derek Thompson on a world without work\n\nAutor is most famous for his work on the China shock. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization; six years later, 13 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs—about 2 million—had disappeared. The China shock took a disproportionate toll on small-scale manufacturing—textiles, toys, furniture—concentrated primarily in the South. “Many of the workers in those places still haven’t recovered,” Autor said, “and we’re obviously living with the political consequences.”\n\nBut AI isn’t a trade policy. It’s software. Even if it hits some professions and places first—a lawyer in a large urban firm, say, may feel the impact years before a worker in a less digitized industry—the technology won’t be constrained by geography. Eventually, everyone will be affected.\n\nAll of this sounds foreboding, until you remember the most important thing about software: People hate it, almost as much as they hate change.\n\nThis is what gives many economists confidence that the AI asteroid is still at least a decade away. “These tech CEOs want us to believe that the market for automation is preordained, and that it will all happen smoothly and profitably,” Acemoglu said. He then made a disdainful noise from his Nobel Prize–winning bullshit detector. “History tells us it’s actually going to happen much slower.”\n\nThe argument goes like this: Before AI can transform a company, it has to access the company’s data and be woven into existing systems—which sounds easy, provided you’re not a chief technology officer. A trade secret of most Fortune 500 companies is that they still run many critical functions on lumbering, industrial-strength mainframe computers that almost never break down and therefore can never be replaced. Mainframes are like Christopher Walken: They’ve been going nonstop since the 1960s, they’re fantastic at performing peculiar roles (processing payments, safeguarding data), and nobody alive really understands how they work.\n\nIntegrating legacy tech with modern AI means navigating hardware, vendors, contracts, ancient coding languages, and humans—every one of whom has a strong opinion about the “right” way to make changes. Months pass, then years; another company holiday party comes and goes; and the CEO still can’t understand why the miracle of AI isn’t solving all of their problems.\n\nEvery new general-purpose technology is, for a time, held hostage by the mess of what already exists. The first electric-power stations opened in the 1880s, and no one debated whether they were superior to steam engines. But factories had been built with steam engines in their basements, powering overhead shafts that ran the length of the buildings, with belts and pulleys carrying power to individual machines. To adopt electricity, factory owners didn’t just need to buy motors—they needed to demolish and rebuild their entire operations. Some did. Most just waited for their infrastructure to wear out, which explains why the major economic gains from electrification didn’t show up for 40 years.\n\nNone of this is reassuring enough for the economist Anton Korinek. He’s “super worried,” he told me. He thinks that America will see major job losses—“a very noticeable labor-market effect”—as soon as this year.\n\n“And then those economists you’ve been talking to, they’re going to say, ‘I see that in the data!’ ” Korinek paused. “Let’s not joke about it, because it’s too serious.”\n\nKorinek is a professor and the faculty director of the Economics of Transformative AI Initiative at the University of Virginia. Last year, Time magazine put him on its list of the most influential people in AI. But he did not set out to become an economist. He grew up in an Austrian mountain village, writing machine code in 0s and 1s—the least glamorous form of programming, and the most unforgiving. It teaches you where instructions bottleneck, where systems jam, and what breaks first when pushed too hard.\n\nHe’d kept a close watch on developments in AI since the deep-learning breakthroughs of the early 2010s, even as his doctoral work focused on the prevention of financial crises. When he got his first demo of a large language model, in September 2022, it took “about five seconds” before he considered its consequences for the future of work, starting with his own.\n\nWe met for breakfast in Charlottesville in the fall. Korinek is youthful and slender, with delicate wire-frame glasses and a faintly red beard. My overall impression was of someone who’d rather be customizing Excel tabs than prophesizing doom. Still, here he was, saying the five words economists disdain the most: This time may be different.\n\nThe crux of Korinek’s argument is simple: His colleagues aren’t misreading the data—they’re misreading the technology. “We can’t quite conceptualize having very smart machines,” Korinek said. “Machines have always been dumb, and that’s why we don’t trust them and it’s always taken time to roll them out. But if they’re smarter than us, in many ways they can roll themselves out.”\n\nThis is already happening. Many of the least comprehensible ads during sporting events are for AI tools that promise to speed the integration of other AI tools into the workflows of large companies. Because many of these systems don’t require massive new hardware or human-engineered system rewrites, the rollout time shrinks by as much as 50 percent.\n\nThis is where Korinek parts company with the rearview economists. If AI moves as fast as he expects, for many workers the damage will arrive before institutions can adapt—and each successful use will only intensify the pressure for more.\n\nConsider consulting firms, which have always charged high fees for having junior associates do research and draft reports—fees clients tolerated because there was no alternative. But if one firm can use AI to deliver the same work faster and cheaper, its competitors face a stark choice: adopt the technology, or explain why they are still charging a premium for human hours. Once a firm plugs in and undercuts its rivals, the rest must either race to follow or be left behind. Competition doesn’t just reward adoption; it makes delay indefensible.\n\nKorinek concedes the two standard objections: The numbers don’t show anything definitive yet, and new technologies have historically created more jobs than they’ve destroyed. But he thinks that his peers need to start driving with their eyes looking ahead. “Whenever I speak to people at the labs on the West Coast”—Korinek is an unpaid member of Anthropic’s economic advisory council—“it does not strike me that they are trying to artificially hype what they’re producing. I usually have the sense that they are just as terrified as I am. We should at least consider the possibility that what they are telling us may come true.”\n\nKorinek is not sure that the technology itself can be steered by policy, but he wants more economists doing scenario planning so that policy makers aren’t caught flat-footed—because mass job loss doesn’t just mean unemployment; it means missed loan payments, cascading defaults, shrinking consumer demand, and the kind of self-reinforcing downturn that can transform a shock into a crisis, and a crisis into the decline of an empire.\n\nAfter thE brief period in early 2025 when CEOs were openly volunteering “thought leadership” about AI and its impact on their workforces and profit margins, the pronouncements stopped, eerily, at roughly the same time. Anyone who has seen a shark fin break the water and then disappear knows this is not reassuring.\n\nThe simple explanation comes courtesy of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. America employs about 280,590 public-relations specialists, an increase of 69 percent over the past two decades. (They outnumber journalists almost 7 to 1.) It’s not hard to imagine their expert syllogism: AI is unpopular. CEOs who talk about job cuts are even less popular. So maybe shut up about AI and jobs?\n\nIn October, the day after The New York Times revealed Amazon executives’ plan to potentially automate more than 600,000 jobs by 2033, the PR chief at a large multinational firm told me, “We are so done speaking about this.” It was at least a small piece of history—the first time I’d been asked to grant anonymity to someone so they could explain, on the record, that they would no longer be speaking at all.\n\nAll of which is to say that the chief executives of Walmart, Amazon, Ford, and other Fortune 100 companies, as well as executives from rising AI-driven firms including Anthropic, Stripe, and Waymo—people who had been remarkably chatty about AI and jobs a few months earlier—declined or ignored multiple interview requests for this story. Even the Business Roundtable, an association of 200 CEOs from America’s most powerful companies that exists to speak for its members on exactly these kinds of issues, told me that its CEO, former George W. Bush White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten, had nothing to say.\n\nOf course, telling a reporter you won’t speak on the record isn’t the same as not speaking. The CEOs are talking to at least one person: Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a Microsoft board member. Hoffman is a technologist by pedigree and an optimist by temperament. He knows everyone in corporate America, and everyone knows he knows everyone, which makes him Silicon Valley’s favorite mensch—a reasonable, neutral sounding board whom CEOs can go to when they want to think out loud. He told me that AI has sorted the CEOs into three groups.\n\nThe first are the dabblers: latecomers finally spending some quality time with their chief technology officers. The second rushed to declare themselves AI leaders out of vanity or a desire to have their traditional businesses taken more seriously by tech snobs. “They’re like, Look at me! I’m important! I’m central here. But they’re not actually doing anything yet,” Hoffman said. “They’re just like, Put me at the AI table too.” The third group is different: executives who are quietly making transformational plans. “These are the ones who see it coming. And to their credit, I think a lot of them want to figure out how to help their whole workforce transition with this through education, reskilling, or training.”\n\nBut what all three groups share is a belief that investors—after years of hearing about AI’s promise—have lost patience with dreaming. This year, they expect results. And the fastest way for a CEO to produce results is to cut head count. Layoffs, Hoffman said, are inevitable. “A lot of them have convinced themselves this only ends one way. Which I think is a failure of the imagination.”\n\nHoffman doesn’t waste time urging CEOs not to make cuts; he knows they will. “What I tell them is that you need to be presenting paths and ideas for how to get benefits from AI that aren’t just cutting costs. How do you get more revenue? How do you help your people transition to being more effective using AI?”\n\n“It’s a fever,” Gina Raimondo, the former governor of Rhode Island and commerce secretary under Joe Biden, told me, referring to the rush to cut jobs. “Every CEO and every board feels like they need to go faster. ‘We have 40,000 people doing customer service? Take it down to 10,000. AI can handle the rest.’ If the whole thing is about moving fast with your eye strictly on efficiency, then an awful lot of people are going to get really hurt. And I don’t think this country can handle that, given where we already are.”\n\nLike Hoffman, Raimondo occupies an unusual niche: a Democrat who can walk into a boardroom without setting off the cultural metal detectors. She co-founded a venture-capital firm, and AI executives, who see her as pragmatic and fluent in tech, are willing to talk to her. “This is a technology that will make us more productive, healthier, more sustainable,” Raimondo said. “But only if we get very serious about managing the transition.”\n\nLast summer, Raimondo made the trip to Sun Valley, Idaho, for the four-day Allen & Co. conference known as “summer camp for billionaires.” She asked people the same two questions: How are you using AI? And what happens to your workers when you do? A number of CEOs admitted that they felt trapped. Wall Street expects them to replace human labor with AI; if they don’t do it, they’ll be the ones out of a job. But if they all order mass job eliminations, they know the consequences will be enormous—for their workforces, for the country, and for their own humanity.\n\nRaimondo’s response was that “it’s the responsibility of the country’s most powerful CEOs to help figure this out.” She sees the possibility of “new public-private partnerships at scale. Imagine if we could get companies to take ownership over the retraining and redeployment of people they lay off.”\n\nShe knows how this sounds. “A lot of people say, ‘Oh, Gina, you’re naive. Never going to happen.’ Okay. But I’m telling you it’s the end of America as we know it if we don’t use this moment to do things differently.”\n\nIf executives’ concern is as genuine as Raimondo thinks, then perhaps they can be moved to action. Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, is trying—and mostly failing—to do just that. CEOs and tech leaders are so focused on winning the AI race that “working people are an afterthought,” she told me.\n\nShuler’s aware that this is a predictable take from a union leader, so she volunteered a concession: “Most working people, and especially union leaders, start out with a panic, right? Like, Wow, this is going to basically obliterate all jobs and everyone’s going to be left without a safety net and we have to put a stop to it—which we know is not going to happen.” Instead of panicking, Shuler said, she talked with the leaders of the AFL-CIO’s unions, representing about 15 million people, and pushed them to use the brief moment before AI is imposed on them to figure out what they want from the technology—and what they might be prepared to trade for that.\n\nMichael Podhorzer: The paradox of the American labor movement\n\nSo far the olive branch has been grabbed by precisely one company. Microsoft has agreed to bring workers into conversations about developing AI and guardrails around it. Most remarkably, the deal includes a neutrality agreement that allows workers to freely form unions without retaliation—something that’s never been done before in tech. “We think it’s a model,” Shuler said. “We would love to see others acknowledge that working people are central to this debate and to our future.”\n\nSquint and you might convince yourself that the Microsoft deal is indeed proof of concept. More likely, it’s an anomaly. Because all the coaxing, reasonableness, and appeals to patriotism and shared humanity are battling a truth as old as wage labor: American capitalism rushes toward efficiency the way water flows downhill—inevitably, indifferently, and with predictable consequences for whoever happens to be standing at the bottom. And with AI, for the first time, capital has a tool that promises the kind of near-limitless productivity the factory and mill owners could never have imagined: maximum efficiency with a minimum number of employees to demand a share of the gains.\n\nIn that context, the silence of the CEOs takes on a different resonance. It could be a cold acknowledgment that the decisions have already been made—or a muffled plea for the government to save them from themselves.\n\nYou’re probably aware that our politics are unbearable at the moment. And yet the only way to make them bearable—to recover the glimmer of promise at their core—is more politics. That’s the joke at the heart of Washington: The very struggle that’s hollowed the place out is also the only way it can be renewed.\n\nIf there were ever an issue capable of relieving the national migraine—something large enough and urgent enough—you might assume the future of American jobs would be it. “At least from my interactions here in the Senate, not many people are talking about it,” Gary Peters, the senior senator from Michigan, told me. “There’s a general attitude among my colleagues”—Peters, a Democrat, singles out Republicans, though he says there’s blame to go around—“like, We don’t need to do anything. It’s going to be fine. In fact, the government should just stay out of it. Let industry move forward and continue to innovate.”\n\nIt’s hard to slow AI without abdicating America’s tech supremacy to China—a point the tech lobby makes with religious fervor. It’s hard to force AI labs to give advance notice of the consequences of their deployments when they often don’t know themselves. You could regulate the use of job-displacing AI, but enforcement would require a regulatory apparatus that doesn’t exist and technical expertise the government doesn’t have.\n\nThat said, the government has a decades-old playbook on how to get workers through economic shocks. And Peters has been banging his head on his desk trying to get Congress to use it.\n\nSince 1974, when the United States began opening its economy more aggressively to global trade, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program has helped more than 5 million people with retraining, wage insurance, and relocation grants, at a cost in recent years of roughly half a billion dollars annually. In 2018, Peters co-sponsored the TAA for Automation Act, which would have extended the same benefits to workers squeezed by AI and robotics. It died quietly, as many things in Congress do. In 2022, authorization for the TAA expired, and in a Congress allergic to trade votes and new spending, Peters’s efforts to revive it have gone nowhere.\n\nThis is very stupid. The United States has about 700,000 unfilled factory and construction jobs. (Ironically, one of the few things slowing AI is a shortage of HVAC technicians qualified to install cooling systems in data centers.) Jim Farley, the Ford CEO who predicted that half of white-collar jobs could disappear in a decade, has been saying that the auto industry is short hundreds of thousands of technicians to work in dealerships—jobs that sit in a long-term sweet spot: technical enough to earn six figures, and dependent on precise manual dexterity that makes them hard to roboticize. But someone has to pay for the months of training the jobs require. “These are really good jobs,” Peters said. But “we spend a lot more money from the federal government for four-year higher-education institutions than we do for skilled-training programs.”\n\nThere’s no shortage of ideas about what to do if AI hollows out large swaths of work: universal basic income, benefits that don’t depend on employers, lifelong retraining, a shorter workweek. They tend to surface whenever technological anxiety spikes—and to recede just as reliably, undone by cost, politics, or the simple fact that they would require a level of coordination the United States has not managed in decades.\n\nThe 119th Congress is a ghost ship, steered by ennui and the desire to evade hard choices. And the AI industry is paying millions of dollars to make sure no one grabs the wheel. To cite just one example, a super PAC called Leading the Future—which has reportedly secured $50 million in commitments from the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and $50 million more from the OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and his wife, Anna—plans to “aggressively oppose” candidates from both parties who threaten the industry’s priorities, which boil down to: Go fast. No, faster.\n\nShuler told me that the AFL-CIO will keep pressing national elected officials for a worker-focused AI agenda, but that “this game is not gonna be played at the federal level as much as it will be at the state level.” More than 1,000 AI bills are bubbling up in statehouses. Of course, the AI money will be there, too; Leading the Future has already announced plans to focus its efforts on New York, California, Illinois, and Ohio.\n\nThe executive branch has delegated almost all of its AI oversight to David Sacks—nominally a co-chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, but functionally a government LARPer who maintains his role as a venture capitalist and podcast host. Sacks, who is also the White House crypto czar, co-wrote the Trump administration’s “America’s AI Action Plan.” A New York Times investigation found that Sacks has at least 449 investments in companies with ties to artificial intelligence. The fox isn’t just guarding the henhouse; he’s livestreaming the feast.\n\nAI is just a newborn. It may grow up to transform our lives in unimaginably good ways. But it has also introduced profound questions about safety, inequality, and the viability of a wage-labor system that, despite its flaws, spawned the most prosperous society in human history. And there’s no sign—none—that our political system is equipped to deal with what’s coming.\n\nWhich means the deepest challenge AI poses may not be to jobs at all.\n\n“Gosh, the textbook ideal of democracy,” says Nick Clegg, “is the peaceful articulation and resolution of differences that otherwise might take a more disruptive or violent form. So you’d like to think that a strong democracy could digest these kinds of changes.”\n\nClegg is a former deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the Liberal Democrats. When he lost his seat in Parliament after Brexit, he moved to California, where he spent seven years running global affairs at Facebook/Meta, becoming a kind of Tocqueville with vested options, before returning to London in 2025. Many governments “just don’t have the levers” to deal with AI, Clegg told me.\n\nHe suspects that the societies best positioned to navigate the next few years are small homogenous ones like the Scandinavians, who are capable of having mature conversations—they’ll put together “some commission led by some very wise former finance minister who will come up with a perfect blueprint which everybody consensually will then do, and they will remain in a hundred years the happiest societies”—or large authoritarian ones that refuse to have conversations at all. China, America’s primary AI rival, has repeatedly demonstrated a capacity to impose rapid, society-wide change (the one-child policy, the forced relocation of more than 1 million people for the Three Gorges Dam) without consent or delay.\n\n“If democratic governments drift into this period, which may require much more rapid change than they currently appear to be capable of delivering,” Clegg warned, “then democracy is not going to pass this test with flying colors.”\n\nHe then delivered, over Zoom, a fantastically British pep talk, combining Churchillian resolve with a faintly patronizing nod to America’s centuries-long streak of pulling four-leaf clovers out of its ass. “You are extraordinarily dynamic,” he began. “It’s remarkable the number of times people have written off America.”\n\nIf politics is to be part of the solution, Gary Peters will not be around to participate; he’s retiring next year. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Congress’s most articulate Republican advocate (really) for safeguarding the workforce from AI, has already resigned. Gina Raimondo is being considered as a potential presidential contender for 2028, and she’s a centrist with the chops to balance the reasons for speeding forward on AI with the need to do so warily. But the issue is unlikely to wait that long. “We’re going into a world that seems to be getting more unstable with each and every day,” Peters said. “And that uncertainty creates anxiety, and anxiety leads to sometimes dramatic shifts in how people act and how they vote.”\n\nWhich brings us to Bernie Sanders, who has been wrestling with an AI-shaped future since it was still theoretical. “Are AI and robotics inherently evil or terrible? No,” Sanders told me in his familiar staccato. “We are already seeing positive developments in terms of health care, the manufacturing of drugs, diagnoses of diseases, etc. But here is the simple question: Who is going to benefit from this transformation?”\n\nAt the Davenport, Iowa, stop on his 2025 Fighting Oligarchy tour, audience members booed when he mentioned AI. And Sanders, the ultimate vibes politician, can feel decades of anger—over trade, inequality, affordability, systematic unfairness, government fealty to corporations—coalescing around AI.\n\nIn October, he issued a 95 theses–style report on AI and employment. It included all of the dire CEO and consulting-firm quotes about the looming job apocalypse and proposed a shorter workweek; worker protections; profit sharing; and an unspecified “robot tax on large corporations,” whose revenue would be used “to benefit workers harmed by AI.” It’s a furious document, as though Sanders typed it with his fists.\n\nAt least one populist politician thinks Sanders didn’t go far enough.\n\nSteve Bannon’s D.C. townhouse is so close to the Supreme Court that you can read JUSTICE THE GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY from the top step. He greeted me in his signature look: camouflage cargo pants, a black shirt, also a brown shirt, also a black button-down shirt. He hadn’t shaved in days. It would not have surprised me if he suggested that we get hoagies, or form a militia.\n\nFrom the July/August 2022 issue: Jennifer Senior on Steve Bannon, a lit bomb in the mouth of democracy\n\nBannon has, shall we say, some scoundrel-like tendencies. But he’s not an AI tourist. In the early 2000s, while still a film producer, he tried to buy the rights to Ray Kurzweil’s The Singularity Is Near, a sacred text of the AI movement that imagines the day when machines surpass human intelligence. Bannon thought it would make a good documentary. He hired an AI correspondent for his War Room podcast a few years ago, and he tracks every corporate-layoff announcement, searching for omens.\n\nHe’s concerned about rogue AI creating viruses and seizing weapons—fears that are shared more soberly by national-security officials, biosecurity researchers, and some notable AI scientists—but he believes the American worker is in such imminent danger that he’s prepared to toss away parts of his ideology. “I’m for the deconstruction of the administrative state, but I’m not an anarchist,” Bannon told me. “You do have to have a regulatory apparatus. If you don’t have a regulatory apparatus for this, then fucking take the whole thing down, right? Because this is what the thing was built for.”\n\nWhat Bannon wants goes beyond regulation. It’s a callback to an old idea: that when the government deems a technology strategically vital, it should own part of it—much as it once did with railroads and, briefly, banks during the 2008 financial crisis. He pointed to what he called Donald Trump’s “brilliant” decision to have the federal government take a 9.9 percent stake in Intel in August. But the stake in AI would need to be much greater, he believes—something commensurate with the scale of federal support flowing to AI companies.\n\n“I don’t know—50 percent as a starter,” Bannon said. “I realize the right’s going to go nuts.” But the government needs to put people with good judgment on these companies’ boards, he said. “And you have to drill down on this now, now, now.”\n\nInstead, he warned, we have “the worst elements of our system—greed and avarice, coupled with people that just want to grasp raw power—all converging.”\n\nI pointed out that the person overseeing this convergence is the same man Bannon helped get elected, and recently suggested should stick around for a third term.\n\n“President Trump’s a great business guy,” Bannon said. But he’s getting “selective information” from Elon Musk, David Sacks, and others who Bannon thinks hopped aboard the Trump bandwagon only to maximize their profit and control of AI. “If you noticed, these guys are not jumping around when I say ‘Trump ’28.’ I don’t get an ‘attaboy.’ ” He said that “they’ve used Trump,” and that he sees a major schism coming within the Republican Party.\n\nBannon’s politics don’t naturally lend themselves to cross-party coalition building, but AI has scrambled even his sense of the boundaries. He and Glenn Beck signed a letter demanding a ban on the development of superintelligent AI, out of fear that systems smarter than humans cannot be reliably contained; they were joined by eminent academics and former Obama-administration officials—“lefties that would rather spit on the floor than say Steve Bannon is with them on anything.” And he’s been sketching out a theory of the coalition needed to confront what’s coming. “These ethicists and moral philosophers—you have to combine that together with, quite frankly, some street fighters.”\n\nHorseshoe issues—where the far right and far left touch—are rare in American politics. They tend to surface when something highly technical (the gold standard in 1896, or the subprime crisis of 2008) alchemizes into something emotional (William Jennings Bryan’s “cross of gold,” the Tea Party). That’s populism. And the threat of pitchforks has occasionally made American capitalism more humane: The eight-hour workday, weekends, and the minimum wage all emerged from the space between reform and revolution.\n\nNo one understands or exploits that shaggy zone quite like Bannon. His anger about AI can sound reasonable in one breath and menacing in the next. We were discussing some of the men who run the most powerful AI labs when he said, “Let’s just be blunt”: “We’re in a situation where people on the spectrum that are not, quite frankly, total adults—you can see by their behavior that they’re not—are making decisions for the species. Not for the country. For the species. Once we hit this inflection point, there’s no coming back. That’s why it’s got to be stopped, and we may have to take extreme measures.”\n\nThe trouble with pitchforks is that once you encourage everyone to grab them, there’s no end to the damage that might be done. And unlike in earlier eras, we’re now a society defined by two objects: phones that let everyone see exactly how much better other people have it, and guns should they decide to do something about it.\n\nAmerica would be better off if its elites could act responsibly without being terrified. If CEOs remembered that citizens are a kind of shareholder, too. If economists tried to model the future before it arrives in their rearview mirror. If politicians chose their constituents’ jobs over their own. None of this requires revolution. It requires everyone to do the jobs they already have, just better.\n\nThere’s an easy place for all of them to start—a bar so low, it amounts to a basic cognitive exam for the republic.\n\nErika McEntarfer was the commissioner of labor statistics until August, when Trump fired her after the release of a weak jobs report. McEntarfer has seen no evidence of political interference at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but “independence is not the only threat facing economic data,” she told me. “Inadequate funding and staffing are also a danger.”\n\nMost of the economic papers trying to figure out the impact of AI on labor demand use the BLS’s Current Population Survey. “It’s the best available source,” McEntarfer said. “But the sample is pretty small. It’s only 60,000 households and hasn’t increased for 20 years. Response rates have declined.” An obvious first step toward figuring out what’s going on in our economy would be to expand the survey’s sample size and add a supplement on AI usage at work. That would involve some extra economists and a few million dollars—a tiny investment. But the BLS budget has been shrinking for decades.\n\nThe United States created the BLS because it believed the first duty of a democracy was to know what was happening to its people. If we’ve misplaced that belief—if we can’t bring ourselves to measure reality; if we can’t be bothered to count—then good luck with the machines.\n\nThis article appears in the March 2026 print edition with the headline “What’s the Worst That Could Happen?”",

    "fullText": "In this article, we’ll start with a basic example using std::mutex, look at its limitations, and then introduce std::shared_mutex, a reader-writer mutex added in C++17. Even in 2026, with many new concurrency features available, std::shared_mutex is still a valuable and practical tool.\n\nWe’ll begin with a small example (a standard “hello world” for this type of mutexes): a counter object that multiple threads can access:\n\nNothing scary so far, and this implementation is correct, thread-safe, and easy to understand.\n\nHowever, there’s a significant limitation: All access is exclusive.\n\nOnly one thread can call get() or increment() at any given time, even though get() does not modify the state.\n\nIn many real-world programs, shared data is read frequently and might be rarely updated/overriden.\n\nWith std::mutex, even multiple read-only operations block each other. This limits scalability and wastes available parallelism.\n\nHave a look at the following example:\n\nOn Compiler Explorer - see here https://godbolt.org/z/cdjrj8hGd - I’m getting the following output:\n\nNotice that some lines repeat the same value. That’s expected. The writer increments the counter every ~15 ms, but readers sample it every ~10 ms, so they can observe the same value more than once. Also, thread scheduling is not deterministic, so each reader may see a slightly different sequence.\n\nIn the demo code, there are many more reads than writes, so is the mutex the best solution here?\n\nstd::shared_mutex is a reader-writer mutex. It supports two locking modes:\n\nThis makes std::shared_mutex a good fit for read-mostly data structures.\n\nLet’s update the counter example:\n\nWith this change, many threads can call get() concurrently, writes remain fully protected, and read scalability improves with almost no extra complexity/\n\nOn Compiler Explorer - https://godbolt.org/z/W1es4qM8x - I’m getting:\n\nThe output is still nondeterministic, and it may look similar between std::mutex and std::shared_mutex. The key difference is not the values printed, but the fact that with std::shared_mutex multiple readers can hold the lock at the same time. This matters when the protected read section is non-trivial (parsing, lookups, copying data, etc.) and when the program is under real contention.\n\nOk, but let’s try to measure the gains to see the difference. I’ll add some extra sleep code to simulate a real “workload”, and then we can compare times.\n\nSee at Compiler Explorer. The output:\n\nOn this machine, std::thread::hardware_concurrency() reports 2 hardware threads. In this setup, the workload is intentionally read-heavy and each read holds the lock for a short but non-trivial amount of time. With std::mutex, all reads and writes use exclusive locking, so reader threads are effectively serialized and must wait for each other. As a result, the total runtime is about 285 ms.\n\nWith std::shared_mutex, read operations acquire a shared lock and can therefore run concurrently. On a system with two hardware threads, this allows two readers to make progress at the same time, significantly reducing contention. Under the same workload and timing parameters, the total runtime drops to about 102 ms. The exact numbers will vary between runs and platforms. Still, the difference clearly illustrates the main advantage of std::shared_mutex for read-mostly workloads: improved throughput when multiple readers can proceed in parallel.\n\nThe “counter” example is small, but the pattern becomes more useful with real data structures. A typical example is a cache.\n\nThis pattern appears often in real systems:\n\nUsing std::shared_mutex allows reads to scale while still keeping writes safe.\n\nA thread must not lock the same std::shared_mutex recursively:\n\nThis applies to both shared and exclusive ownership.\n\nIf upgrading is required, the locking strategy usually needs to change.\n\nstd::shared_mutex has overhead. If:\n\nthen std::mutex may be just as fast or even faster. Measuring is important.\n\nYou can read this recent article about some detailed measurements: When std::shared_mutex Outperforms std::mutex: A Google Benchmark Study – Tech For Talk\n\nSince C++17, the concurrency library has expanded significantly. We now have:\n\nThese tools focus mostly on thread lifetime, coordination, cancellation or lock-free programming.\n\nstd::shared_mutex fills a different role.\n\nIt is still a mutual-exclusion primitive, explicitly designed to protect a shared state with many readers and few writers. It does not compete with atomics, condition variables, or RCU.\n\nIn this article, we explored std::shared_mutex, a synchronization primitive designed for protecting read-mostly shared data. Unlike std::mutex, it allows multiple threads to read the same resource concurrently, while still ensuring exclusive access for writers.\n\nStarting from a simple counter example, we showed how a plain mutex serializes all access and how switching to std::shared_mutex enables concurrent reads with only small changes to the code. A simple benchmark experiment demonstrated that, under a read-heavy workload, this can significantly reduce contention and improve throughput.\n\nEven with newer concurrency features added in C++20 and later, std::shared_mutex remains a useful and practical tool when reads dominate writes and simplicity is preferred over more complex synchronization techniques.\n\nI've prepared a valuable bonus for you!\n\nLearn all major features of recent C++ Standards on my Reference Cards!\n\nCheck it out here:",

    "description": "The third-party company Discord could use for their ID collection is mired in surveillance concerns and links to Epstein via one of its investors",
    "fullText": "Last July was the cut-off date for major digital platforms to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). In an attempt to block access between minors and material deemed “harmful” by the government, platforms like Reddit, Spotify, and X began tougher age verification for their users, such as facial scans or, in some cases, even needing to see government ID. At the top of those stumbling to do so was Discord, whose system is not only easy to game but also not impossible to compromise, with one major security breach exposing some 70,000 users’ IDs shortly after. Now Discord is looking to enforce age verification globally. A firm Discord at one point worked with to do so may be even more controversial than the decision itself.\n\nWhile the roll-out is aimed for March, PC Gamer reports that some Discord users have already been prompted for new age verification, this time using the third-party service Persona. Started in 2018, Persona develops identity detection and anti-fraud technologies. They’ve been having an absolute field day since the OSA, being implemented to verify user ID across Reddit and Roblox. One sticking point, however, is who’s backing the company: Peter Thiel, the cofounder of ICE-approved surveillance firm Palantir.\n\nmanaged to catch it pic.twitter.com/Yyu0FaoDJ7\n\n— Folf (@itsfolf) February 12, 2026\n\nOne of Persona’s biggest investors is the Founders Fund, valuing the company at $1.5 billion and rallying $150 million towards it in 2021. The Founders Fund began in the mid-2000s and made key early investments in the likes of SpaceX, AirBNB, OpenAI and Polymarket. All your favorite tech things “disrupting” the modern world. And who would unleash such a monetary power unto civilization? Why, none other than your friend and mine, the anti-humanist, antichrist-awaiting Thiel.\n\nThiel, of course, is known for many things. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel is now more closely affiliated with Palantir, a company specializing in digital surveillance and exploiting user information. Palantir, named after the crystal balls that allow communication across Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings, has been around since 2003 but has kept plenty busy lately. 404 uncovered how the company has been developing ELITE, an instrument to monitor user information for the purpose of conducting ICE raids. Elsewhere, the recent, massive disclosure of Epstein emails had reoccurring correspondence between the world’s most active user information broker and the world’s most famous sex trafficker. The two discussed the lawsuit to end Gawker and how to best balkanize the planet.\n\nHaving the Founders Fund so close to expanded data-capturing across Discord, one of the more private places to have a public conversation online, has made users a little itchy. The platform has not been entirely clear about how it aims to rapidly expand its age verification process, stating a mix of mandatory scanning but also using existing user data to guesstimate if a user is in their 30s (which is great news for everyone who communicates through Simpsons quotes).\n\nIn an official update, Discord suggested users who encountered prompts from Persona are part of “an experiment” and that the information will only be stored for seven days. How the tech will be used in the long term is yet to be known. When asked for comment, Discord told Kotaku its work with Persona was part of a “limited test” which has since been concluded.\n\nRegardless, I will see you on the forums.",

    "fullText": "A Cardiff weekend combining Valentine's Day and a Wales Six Nations home match would previously have proved the perfect Welsh rugby love affair.\n\nBut there is a chill in the Welsh rugby air to match the freezing February temperatures.\n\nIt is the travelling French fans who have been bouncing around Cardiff with smiles on their faces this weekend, typified by the raucous travelling support at Saturday night's Under-20s win against the impressive Wales youngsters at the Arms Park.\n\nPeople have been falling out of love with Welsh rugby for a while.\n\nCan a shock Six Nations win over France on Sunday somehow rekindle the romance and regain affection for Steve Tandy's side?\n\nHighly unlikely, but you can dare to dream.\n\nThe pre-match build-up has been almost as much about how many people will not turn up this weekend, and whether there will be empty seats in the Principality Stadium, as about the game itself.\n\nTandy insists Wales is a \"rugby nation\" despite tens of thousands of tickets remaining unsold for Sunday's contest with France, and further home games against Scotland and Italy.\n\nWales have historically put up 'sold out' signs for Test matches at their 74,500-seater Principality Stadium home, with rugby often referred to as the \"national sport\".\n\nThe lowest crowd for a Wales home Six Nations game against France was in 2022 when 63,208 attended a Friday night match.\n\nTwo years later the same fixture was held on a Sunday and attracted a crowd of 71,242. The smallest attendance in this tournament at the game's Welsh home was 58,349 against Italy in 2002.\n\nThe cost of a match-day experience in Cardiff has been suggested as the reason for some fans staying away.\n\nSome argue crowds of 60,000 to see a struggling team in a small nation on a Sunday is still a healthy number.\n\nEspecially when you consider the Wales football team had attendances of around 3,000 when they were struggling a couple of decades ago.\n\nThere are others who claim empty seats and some tickets being given away is indicative of the current turmoil in Welsh rugby.\n\nTens of thousands of Six Nations tickets still unsold amid Welsh rugby turmoil\n\nPersonal abuse of WRU has 'crossed a line' - Manders\n\nPeople are witnessing the demise of Wales, a country that have enjoyed Six Nations success and Grand Slam victories over the past two decades.\n\nThe dedicated fans will try to stick by their beloved side through thick and thin but it has proved a turbulent time since the 2023 World Cup.\n\nWales have lost 22 of the past 24 internationals, which included an 18-match losing sequence, with the only two victories coming against Japan.\n\nThere have been 12 straight Six Nations defeats, a record now stretching back 1,072 days to when Wales beat Italy in Rome in March 2023.\n\nAnd there are very few home comforts, with Wales having not won a match in Cardiff in the tournament for four years since defeating Scotland in February 2022. That was 1,464 days ago.\n\nIt has also been the manner of humbling home defeats in recent times, with heavy record losses to England (68-14), Argentina (52-28) and South Africa (73-0).\n\nEven the loss to New Zealand in November, which has been held up as Wales showing some green shoots of recovery, was a 52-26 loss.\n\nDespite the results, captain Dewi Lake has extolled the Principality Stadium surroundings.\n\n\"It is our ground, the best stadium in the world and we are excited to be back home,\" said Lake.\n\n\"Our goal with our game on the pitch is to get the fans involved, to give them life and energy because that feeds back onto us.\"\n\nWales need to back up those rousing words with actions.\n\nWales v France, Principality Stadium\n\nSunday, 15 February at 15:10 GMT\n\nIt was always going to be a huge task for Tandy when he came into the role last year and his baptism has shown that.\n\nWales have lost four of his opening five matches in charge, conceding 248 points and 34 tries.\n\nThat is an average of 50 points and seven tries per game, with Tandy admitting he is looking to bring in a defence coach so he does not have to continue to do both roles.\n\nTandy has also been beset by an ill-disciplined side that has picked up 10 yellow cards and one red card in those five games.\n\nUnder Tandy Wales have faced the best three sides in the world in England, New Zealand and South Africa with fourth-placed France to follow today.\n\nWhile there is a lack of depth and quality, Wales do have top-tier players who compete in the English and French leagues.\n\nThere is a feeling that a squad that can field Tomos Williams, Dewi Lake, Dafydd Jenkins, Rhys Carre, Louis Rees-Zammit and Aaron Wainwright should be performing better, while Tandy has baffled many by continually leaving out Leicester flanker Tommy Reffell.\n\nRecent defeats should not have been as seismic as they have been and must not be accepted as a new normal.\n\nThat is Tandy's conundrum. To maximise what he has at his disposal. He has not managed to do that so far in his short stint in charge and will hope to change that, starting against France.\n\nNot many people will expect Wales to win a game in this tournament as the gap between them and the other five nations grows. They should, however, expect more competitive performances.\n\nWales v France - your guide to the Six Nations date\n\nWales recall Hawkins and Cracknell for France visit\n\nCentre Brau-Boirie to make France debut in Wales\n\nFor many, it is not the coaches and the players who are the problem. It is the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU)'s fault.\n\nThe WRU are not the most popular organisation in Wales right now as they pursue their the policy of cutting a professional men's side.\n\nWelsh rugby's governing body insists there is not the money or player base to maintain the four regions and are sticking to their choice to drop to three teams, something first proposed in October.\n\nThe decision is deemed necessary by some, to arrest the alarming decline, but opposed vehemently by others.\n\nThis week one of the most prominent businesswomen in the country called for WRU chair Richard Collier-Keywood to resign, while the governing body has written to clubs outlining hate abuse received by some WRU board members.\n\nThis has followed a toxic few weeks after the WRU revealed Ospreys owners, Y11 Sport and Media, were the preferred bidder to take over Cardiff who have been WRU owned since going into administration in April 2025.\n\nThis has riled Ospreys supporters who fear they would no longer have a professional team beyond 2026-27 if the Cardiff deal goes through.\n\nThey have held protests, created petitions and attended meetings. Swansea Council has initiated legal action.\n\nThe focus has been directed towards the WRU, although it must also be remembered it is Y11 preparing to buy another Welsh side that could see the end of the professional entity they already own.\n\nFans have taken to social media to urge others to boycott Wales games and not give any money to the WRU.\n\nThat could be counter-productive because more than 50% of the WRU's turnover - money that goes back into the game - comes from the men's home internationals.\n\nBut you sense the strength of feeling.\n\nSwansea Council say they 'were told Ospreys wouldn't exist'\n\nOspreys fans ramp up protest against WRU and Y11\n\nWRU accused of 'malicious cultural vandalism'\n\nIf Wales are not an attraction, there is a pretty special French team coming to Cardiff looking to defend their Six Nations title.\n\nThey are captained by superstar scrum-half Antoine Dupont who says the Principality Stadium is his favourite ground outside of France.\n\n\"We respect the Welsh team and we know in international rugby we cannot underrate any opponent,\" said Dupont.\n\n\"We have known the position Wales are in because in the past, maybe 10 years ago, it was a tough time for French rugby as well.\n\n\"They have some young players at the moment so they need time to have the experience necessary at this level to win games.\"\n\nClassy words and there is plenty to love about the opposition this weekend in Cardiff.\n\nLes Bleus defence coach Shaun Edwards has also been a popular figure with Welsh fans during his 12 years in Warren Gatland's Wales coaching team.\n\nEdwards reminds Wales of a more successful time. A time when Welsh rugby revelled in the present but failed to prepare for its future.\n\nWhether Welsh rugby returns to some of those great days remains to be seen.\n\nFor now they remain huge underdogs for their latest Six Nations date - and should they somehow overcome the French favourites it would be one of the tournaments most romantic upsets of recent time.",

    "fullText": "MUNICH (AP) — About 250,000 people demonstrated on Saturday against Iran's government on the sidelines of a gathering of world leaders in Germany, police said, answering a call from Iran ’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for cranked-up international pressure on Tehran.\n\nBanging drums and chanting for regime change, the giant and boisterous rally in Munich was part of what Pahlavi described as a “global day of action\" to support Iranians in the wake of deadly nationwide protests. He also called for demonstrations in Los Angeles and Toronto. Police said in a post on X that the number of protesters reached some 250,000, more than the organizers had expected.\n\n“Change, change, regime change” the huge crowd chanted, waving green-white-and-red flags with lion and sun emblems. Iran used that flag before its 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Pahlavi dynasty.\n\nAt a news conference, Pahlavi warned of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch\" following Iran’s deadly crackdown on protesters last month.\n\n“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked. He added that the survival of Iran's government “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.”\n\nAn estimated 350,000 people marched on the streets of Toronto as part of the Global Day of Action Rally, Toronto Police spokesperson Laura Brabant said.\n\nAt the Munich rally, demonstrators sported “Make Iran Great Again\" red caps, mimicking the MAGA caps worn by U.S. President Donald Trump 's supporters. Among those sporting the caps was U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who gave a speech to the crowd during which he was photographed holding up the headwear.\n\nMany at the rally waved placards showing Pahlavi, some that called him a king. The son of Iran’s deposed shah has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in Iran’s future.\n\nThe crowd chanted “Pahlavi for Iran,” and “democracy for Iran\" as drums and cymbals sounded.\n\n“We have huge hopes and (are) looking forward that the regime is going to change hopefully,” said Daniyal Mohtashamian, a demonstrator who traveled from Zurich, in Switzerland, to speak for protesters inside Iran who faced repression.\n\n“There is an internet blackout, and their voices are not going outside of Iran,” he said.\n\nAbout 500 protesters also rallied outside the presidential palace in Nicosia, Cyprus, with many holding up banners with slogans against Iran's government and in favor of Pahlavi.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,005 people were killed in last month's protests, including 214 government forces. It has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists inside Iran to verify deaths.\n\nIran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\n\nThe Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.\n\nIranian leaders are facing renewed pressure from Trump, who has threatened U.S. military action. Trump wants Iran to further scale back its nuclear program. He suggested Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.\"\n\nIran was also the focus of protests in Munich on Friday, the opening day of an annual security conference in the city gathering European leaders and global security figures. Supporters of the Iranian opposition group People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, also known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, demonstrated.",

    "fullText": "A survey last fall by Natixis Investment Managers found that 74% of institutional money managers expect a market correction in 2026. They cited various reasons, from the tech bubble bursting to geopolitics and macroeconomic factors. Currently, the Nasdaq Composite is hovering around even year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen roughly 1.7%.\n\nCorrections are part of the investment landscape. We had one last year, and there have been eight corrections or bear markets over the past 10 years.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile you can't avoid them, you can prepare for them with stocks designed to zig when the market zags. Here are two within the healthcare sector that may help you do that.\n\nTwo pharmaceutical giants, AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Merck (NYSE: MRK), have \n\nIn the last few down cycles, both AbbVie and Merck stocks soared. In the 2022 bear market, AbbVie stock jumped 24% for the year, while Merck surged 49%. That year, the S&P 500 finished down 18%. In 2018, when the S&P 500 dropped 4%, AbbVie was down 1%, and Merck rose 40%.\n\nOn the other hand, both stocks do tend to underperform in years when the overall markets are strong. But the long-term numbers are generally in line with the S&P 500. They just don't move in tandem with the large-cap benchmark. AbbVie stock has an average annualized return of 15% over the past 10 years, while Merck is at 10%. For comparison, the S&P 500 has a 10-year annualized return of 14%.\n\nA hallmark of a good defensive stock is its dividend, and both AbbVie and Merck offer robust dividends.\n\nAbbVie just raised its dividend last month by 5% to $1.73 per share at a yield of 3.10%. This is the 13th consecutive year that it has increased its dividend -- something it has done every year since it spun off from Abbott Laboratories  in 2013.\n\nMerck pays out a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share at a yield of 2.99%. Like AbbVie, its yield is some three times the S&P 500 average yield of 1.13%. It has raised its dividend for 15 years in a row.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — With heavy rain expected to move into the region beginning Monday and lasting through Thursday, the City of San Diego announced crews are ramping up preparations to reduce the risk of flooding across the city.\n\nCity officials say storm teams will be monitoring river levels, storm channels and more than 46,000 storm drains during the rainy stretch. Crews have been cleaning drains and inlets known for debris buildup, as well as sweeping streets to prevent trash and pollutants from washing into local waterways.\n\nLow-lying areas such as Mission Valley, Sorrento Valley and Southcrest — identified by FEMA as Special Flood Hazard Areas — are especially vulnerable during extended rain events. City officials say roads in flood-prone areas may be closed if needed and drivers are urged to avoid those areas during heavy rainfall.\n\nAuthorities investigate fatal three-vehicle crash in East County\n\nThe city’s Stormwater Department has also cleared tons of debris and vegetation from storm channels in recent months, including ongoing maintenance along Chollas Creek. Officials say staff will continue monitoring those areas throughout the storm and conduct additional maintenance once the weather clears\n\n“Preparing for potential flooding is part of the city’s responsibility year-round,” said Stormwater Department Director Todd Snyder. “Our crews are working to make sure our stormwater systems are ready and we encourage residents to take a few simple steps now to prepare for the rain.”\n\nCity leaders are asking San Diegans to take several simple steps to help reduce flooding near their homes, including:\n\nSweep and remove trash, leaves and debris around storm drains and gutters.\n\nSecurely close trash and recycling bin lids and place bins 2 to 3 feet away from the curb to avoid blocking stormwater flow.\n\nTurn off irrigation systems to conserve water and minimize runoff.\n\nNever open or lift manhole covers during street flooding.\n\nEmergency responders also remind residents to know the safest routes to and from their homes in case flooding occurs, and to never drive, ride or walk through floodwaters.\n\nSandbags are available in limited quantities at 11 recreation centers across the city, with a limit of 10 bags per household or business. Sand is not provided, and residents are encouraged to purchase sand from local hardware or landscape supply stores.\n\nPacific Beach Recreation Center (Council District 1)\n\nNorth Clairemont Recreation Center and Robb Field Athletic Area (Council District 2)\n\nGolden Hill Recreation Center (Council District 3)\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center (Council District 4)\n\nScripps Ranch Recreation Center (Council District 5)\n\nStandley Recreation Center (Council District 6)\n\nAllied Gardens Recreation Center (Council District 7)\n\nSilver Wing Recreation Center and Southcrest Recreation Center (Council District 8)\n\nCity Heights Recreation Center (Council District 9)\n\nSandbags are available during normal recreation center hours.\n\nFor more storm preparedness information, residents can visit the city’s Storm Preparedness webpage.",

    "description": "Barack Obama offered a lengthy response to Donald Trump's video depicting the former president and his wife as apes.",
    "fullText": "Barack Obama responded to the racist video posted by Donald Trump’s Truth Social account last week that depicted the former president and his wife, Michelle Obama, as apes. While speaking to Brian Taylor Cohen on the Saturday episode of his podcast, Obama said, “What is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum.”\n\nObama emphasized that it is “important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.”\n\nHe continued: “You know, it is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction. But, you know, as I’m traveling around the country, as you’re traveling around the country, you meet people. They still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness. And there’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television.”\n\n“And what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum. And a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? So that’s been lost,” Obama also said.\n\nBut the former president also said he has reason to be hopeful.\n\n“The reason I point out that I don’t think the majority of the American people approve of this is because ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people. And we just saw this in Minnesota and Minneapolis.”\n\nThe “unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis [and] St. Paul” has resulted in “the extraordinary outpouring of organizing, community building, decency, neighbors, buying groceries for folks, accompanying children to school, teachers who were standing up for their kids,” Obama said.\n\n“Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, ‘This is not the America we believe in, and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth, and with cameras, and with peaceful protests,’ and shining a light on the sort of behavior that, you know, in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships, but we have not seen in America.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly refused to apologize for the video. “That was a video on, as you know, voter fraud, and a fairly long video, and they had a little piece that had to do with ‘The Lion King,'” he told reporters this week.\n\nHe continued: “It’s been very well—it’s been shown all over the place, long before that was posted. But that was a very strong, and I’m sure you saw it, very strong piece on voter fraud. And the piece that you’re talking about was all over the place many times, I believe for years.”\n\nReaction to the video was strongly negative on both sides of the aisle, and Trump’s team ultimately deleted it after it was live for 12 hours.\n\nThe post Barack Obama Responds to Trump’s Racist Ape Video: ‘Doesn’t Seem to Be Any Shame’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "\"Policymakers and the public remain largely unaware of the risks posed by what would effectively be a point-of-no-return transition.\"",
    "fullText": "Surprise, surprise: all that climate stuff scientists have been warning us about is coming back to bite us. And by us, of course, we mean all of humanity.\n\nAs reported by the Guardian, scientists just published a warning that Earth is approaching a point of no return. A new study in the journal One Earth shows multiple climate systems — the Greenland ice sheet, the West Antarctic ice sheet, boreal permafrost, the Amazon rainforest — are all much closer to collapse than previously thought.\n\n“Research shows that several Earth system components may be closer to destabilising than once believed,” the researchers urged. “While the exact risk is uncertain, it is clear that current climate commitments are insufficient.”\n\nThe analysis is based on climate “tipping points,” meaning collapses of environmental systems that lead other climate systems beyond their own tipping points, creating a snowball scenario where the planet spirals into a worst-case-scenario known as “hothouse Earth.” Under this scenario, the long-term temperature is projected to rise about 9 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial averages — which would be really bad.\n\n“Crossing even some of the [tipping point] thresholds could commit the planet to a hothouse trajectory,” said Christopher Wolf, a scientist at the environmental group Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Associates. “Policymakers and the public remain largely unaware of the risks posed by what would effectively be a point-of-no-return transition.”\n\nWhat makes this all particularly insulting is the fact that the poor people of the world — those who will suffer the earliest and deepest losses as a result of climate change — are powerless to stop these tipping points from boiling over. And not for lack of will: the global climate movement is growing steadily, as Americans have perhaps never been more aware that climate change will impact the low-income people of the world the most.\n\nUnfortunately, the power to reverse these decisions doesn’t belong to the people, but to a small cabal of the ultra-rich. The future of the planet is so far out of our control that some environmental experts argue not even the world’s most powerful governments can stop the collapse.\n\nAs University of Manitoba professor David Camfield and author of the 2022 book “Future on Fire: Capitalism and the Politics of Climate Change” has explained, the level of political power held by the ultra-rich and their corporations is so immense that even a government with popular support and commitment to emissions cuts would struggle under the weight of corporate investment strikes, pressure from credit agencies, and catastrophic market disruption.\n\n“To weaken those political obstacles sufficiently that a government could get a just transition underway would take massive pressure of the kind that only movements can unleash,” Camfield asserts.\n\nThe math, in other words, is brutal. Capitalism’s logic demands unending accumulation of wealth, leading to a world in which corporations must grow or die, no matter the consequences. To transition out of this mess would mean weakening capital’s entire grip on power — something which has only ever been achieved when the great masses of toiling people come together to demand a better world.\n\nMore on climate change: The Richest 1 Percent Burned Their Entire Share of Carbon for the Year in Just 10 Days",

    "title": "Toyota Wants Dealers To Push Other Models Because It Cannot Build Enough of Its Bestseller",
    "description": "Toyota says demand for RAV4 is outpacing supply as production shifts to the next generation across multiple plants. With inventory tight, dealers are asked to close the gap by selling models like Crown, bZ, and upcoming C-HR EV while avoiding big markups.",
    "fullText": "Toyota’s RAV4 has become one of the defining vehicles of the modern U.S. market, to the point that the company has found itself in an unusual position. Demand is so strong that Toyota is encouraging dealers to steer shoppers toward less popular models, not because interest is fading, but because supply cannot keep up.\n\nThe pressure has intensified as Toyota transitions production of the next generation RAV4 across multiple plants. The redesigned RAV4 was revealed in 2025, and the staggered changeovers needed to build the next generation across multiple plants in Kentucky, Ontario, and Japan are expected to constrain early availability. Even before that changeover, the RAV4 was already operating near the ceiling of Toyota’s production capacity.\n\nIn simple terms, Toyota is facing a textbook problem of demand outpacing supply. The response is not to cool the market but to rebalance the showroom.\n\nAt a meeting held during the National Automobile Dealers Association event in Las Vegas, Toyota Motor North America executive David Christ delivered a clear message. If RAV4 inventory remains tight, dealers will need to make up part of that shortfall by selling other vehicles in Toyota’s lineup.\n\nToyota and Lexus have been operating with relatively lean inventories, and there is little indication that conditions will normalize quickly. Christ noted that a large share of Toyota’s available stock is concentrated in pickup trucks, which gives the brand more breathing room in that part of the portfolio. Passenger cars and crossovers, however, remain a more uncertain picture that will depend on how the year develops.\n\nThis kind of constraint has a real-world effect at the dealership level. When a high-demand model becomes scarce, pricing pressure often shifts from manufacturer strategy to retailer behavior.\n\nLimited availability has already produced some uncomfortable side effects. Some dealers have reportedly added markups to the new RAV4, in some cases several thousand dollars above the manufacturer’s suggested price.\n\nThat approach risks undermining the reputation the RAV4 has built over years. Part of the model’s appeal has always been its rational value proposition: strong resale, proven reliability, and a practical package that makes sense for a wide range of households. When shoppers see a mainstream compact SUV priced like a premium product, it can damage trust and push buyers to competitors.\n\nToyota does not directly control every dealer pricing decision, but the brand’s long-term strength depends on keeping core models aligned with their image in the market.",

    "description": "Pam Bondi wrote in a Saturday letter the DOJ has released \"all\" Epstein-related files and listed a number of \"politically exposed persons\" like Trump and Biden",
    "fullText": "(Photo Credit: Justice Department)\n\nThe Justice Department said it has released “all” files tied to dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, according to a letter sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche to lawmakers on Saturday night.\n\nBondi and Blanche’s letter said the DOJ has fulfilled its obligation to release files as part of the Epstein Transparency Act and outlined why it redacted certain portions.\n\n“In accordance with the requirements of the Act, and as described in various Department submissions to the courts of the Southern District of New York assigned to the Epstein and [Ghislaine] Maxwell prosecutions and related orders, the Department released all ‘records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the possession of the Department’ that ‘relate to’ [Epstein],” the letter said.\n\nIt also included a lengthy list of government officials and “politically exposed persons” who were named in the files.\n\nThat list included President Donald Trump, ex-President Joe Biden, Tucker Carlson, Bruce Springsteen, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, California Sen. Adam Schiff (D), Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, Barbra Streisand, ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Barack Obama, among many others.\n\n“Names appear in the files released under the Act in a wide variety of contexts,” the letter noted. “For example, some individuals had extensive direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell, while other individuals are mentioned only in a portion of a document (including press reporting) that on its face is unrelated to the Epstein or Maxwell matters.”\n\nThe letter said “No records were withheld or redacted ‘on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.'”\n\nPolitico senior legal affairs reporter Josh Gerstein shared the letter on X; you can read the full six-page document by clicking here.\n\nJUST IN: DOJ sends Hill a letter purporting to fulfill requirement in Epstein Files Transparency Act for an explanation of all redactions from released files. The six-page letter is a lot less detailed than 1 would get in run-of-the-mill #FOIA case. Doc: https://t.co/5PT7HWgJ0N\n\n— Josh Gerstein (@joshgerstein) February 15, 2026\n\nIt was addressed to Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD).\n\nThe Justice Department, according to the letter, worked “in consultation with victim counsel and victims directly” on what should be redacted in the files. That included “personally indentifiable information of victim or victims’ personal and medical files,” which the letter said “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n\nSaturday’s letter comes just days after Bondi was lambasted by a number of Democratic lawmakers — and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) — over her handling of Epstein-related files.\n\nRaskin started the hearing off by accusing Bondi of “ignoring” victims and leading a “massive Epstein cover-up” that he said is the biggest failure in Justice Department history.\n\n“You replace real prosecutors with counterfeit stooges who robotically do the president’s bidding,” Raskin said. “Nothing in American history comes close to this complete corruption of the justice function and contamination of federal law enforcement.”\n\nBondi got her own shots in, branding Raskin a “washed-up, loser lawyer” who was a political failure.\n\nThe Saturday letter also comes after the Justice Department released 3.5 million files on Epstein at the end of January. Trump told reporters those files “absolve” him of any wrongdoing, and they included an FBI document showing Trump thanked Florida cops and told them to “focus” on “evil” Maxwell back in 2006, among many other files.\n\nBondi and Blanche did not mention the letter on their social media accounts on Saturday, and there is no mention of more files — or the letter — on the Justice Department’s website.\n\nOther famous names mentioned in the letter include: Massie, George Clooney, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Jared Kushner, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Elon Musk, ex-Vice President Mike Pence, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D), California Rep. Eric Swalwell (D), Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former President Bill Clinton, and former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe DOJ has a dedicated “Epstein Library” hub where it has been releasing all Epstein-related files, which you can scan for yourself by clicking here.\n\nThe post BREAKING: Pam Bondi Says DOJ Released ‘All’ Epstein Files — Names Trump, Biden, Zuckerberg, Tucker Carlson Among ‘Politically Exposed Persons’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Nashville SC lost to Lexington SC 2-1 at Geodis Park on Feb. 14, its final preseason game before it begins MLS play.",
    "fullText": "If the idea is to be in top form by the start of the season, Nashville SC would have some soul-searching to do.\n\nBut after a 2-1 loss to Lexington SC in its final preseason game on Feb. 14 at Geodis Park, coach B.J. Callaghan didn't seem overly worried with the result.\n\nNashville mostly dominated possession against Lexington, a team from the second-division USL Championship, but gave up a pair of goals on unforced errors. In the 42nd minute, goalkeeper Xavier Valdez failed to control a routine back-pass and gave up the ball directly to a Lexington forward, and with 10 minutes to play, Nashville turned the ball over once more, leading to Lexington's game-winning goal.\n\n\"Mistakes are always going to happen,\" Callaghan said. \"We're more concerned with how we respond from mistakes. I thought the group, as a whole, responded fairly well and went right back and continued to look like us.\"\n\nNashville scored its lone goal in the 55th minute off a bad pass by Lexington's goalkeeper. Hany Mukhtar intercepted the pass and assisted Cristian Espinoza, who fired it home from close range.\n\n\"In the first half, I thought we were too slow with the ball and didn't move it well and missed the opportunities and openings that were there,\" Callaghan said. \"In the second half, the tempo was better, the intensity was better. Overall, it's probably a good performance in the way of some of the things that we've been working on. But at the end of the day, I think guys probably still need to step up and perform at a higher level.\"\n\nMORE: Nashville SC signs Eddi Tagseth to contract extension through 2027\n\nNashville finished the preseason with two wins, two losses and one draw in five games and was outscored 9-8. Its first competitive game is on Feb. 17 at Atletico Ottawa in the first round of the CONCACAF Champions Cup, and it hosts the New England Revolution on Feb. 21 to start MLS play.\n\nNashville began with what appeared to be a full-strength lineup, with Mukhtar, Espinoza and Sam Surridge in attack, Eddi Tagseth and Patrick Yazbek in midfield and Dan Lovitz, Maxwell Woledzi, Jeisson Palacios and Andy Najar on defense. Outside of Valdez and Ahmed Qasem, who were replaced by Joe Willis and Shak Mohammed, respectively, at halftime, Nashville's starters played most of the match.\n\n\"The main exercise was to get the next group 75 minutes into their legs, so that going into Ottawa, every single player is ready to go a full 90 if needed,\" Callaghan said.\n\nJacob Shames can be reached by email at jshames@gannett.com and on X/Twitter @Jacob_Shames.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: BJ Callaghan, Nashville SC not worried about loss to end preseason",

    "description": "The Brooklyn Nets moved up to 26th in NBA.com's power rankings heading into the All-Star Break.",
    "fullText": "The Brooklyn Nets have not been playing the way they were hoping for since the calendar turned to January, but the good news is that the All-Star Break should serve as a reset of sorts. Brooklyn dealt with some injuries heading into the All-Star Break, specifically to forward Michael Porter Jr., but the Nets are slightly moving up in the power rankings prior to the Break.\n\n\"The Nets held onto Michael Porter Jr. at the deadline, a possible indication that they intend to be competitive in the 2026-27 season (with no control of their ’27 first-round pick),\" John Schuhmann wrote for NBA.com. Schuhmann ranked the Nets 26th in his latest power rankings pointing to the fact that Brooklyn is still regarded as one of the worst teams in the league despite the fact that they didn't trade Porter away.\n\n\"They added some second-rounders by helping teams duck the luxury tax and decided that Cam Thomas would be one of the players they waived to create the requisite roster space,\" Schuhmann continued on his view of what Brooklyn did at the deadline before noting how the Nets are committing to playing the rookies more. \"Brooklyn now ranks second (behind Charlotte) in the percentage of its minutes (29%) that have come from rookies.\"\n\nWhen Schuhmann wrote this version of his power rankings, the Nets had not yet played the Chicago Bulls or Indiana Pacers at home prior to the All-Star Break coming around. Brooklyn was able to beat the Bulls 123-115 on Feb. 9, but the Nets dropped the ball against the Pacers on Feb. 11 as they lost 115-110 despite leading by as many as 18 points in the contest.\n\nUltimately, the Nets have 29 games left to play for the rest of the season and with all of the talk surrounding the Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards when it comes to tanking, Brooklyn seems to be sticking to their usual rotation when those players are healthy. However, with the Nets having the fifth-worst record in the NBA heading into All-Star Break, it will be interesting to see if the team gravitates towards playing the younger players more down the stretch.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: Nets rank 26th in NBA.com power rankings heading into All-Star Break",

    "description": "Team USA's dominant start to the Olympics in Game 1 turned into a closer-than-expected victory over Denmark in Game 2. Their chances of clinching the top overall seed took a hit, but they dealt with some adversity effectively.",
    "fullText": "The USA's men's Olympic hockey team couldn't have asked for a better first game, but they certainly could have for their second.\n\nWhen they took out Team Latvia on Thursday, they were firing on all pistons, with five players recording two points. And star goalie Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets was nearly perfect for the Americans, which looked like the dominant force many believed they'd be at the Games.\n\nThe Americans got a reality check on Saturday courtesy of Team Denmark, which put up a fight for much of the game before the States pulled away and won 6-3.\n\nSubpar goaltending from Jeremy Swayman and an offense against a team the United States were expected to blow out could have made their next two games more difficult than they needed to be. That said, the wakeup call could help them adjust and come out stronger.\n\nThe result turned out to be in Team USA's favor, with the Americans outshooting Denmark 47-21. But it was not nearly as one-sided as the score or shot count might suggest.\n\nThe Danes took the first two leads of the game, less than two minutes into the first period and again midway through the first. Nobody had that on their bingo card. And although the Americans wound up flexing their muscles by scoring three times in a 7:57 span during the second period, the game on the whole was far closer than the U.S. would've preferred.\n\nMen's #Olympics standings after day 4.🏒 #IIHF pic.twitter.com/xq3tB3ZSzb\n\n— IIHF (@IIHFHockey) February 14, 2026\n\nTeam USA now has a goal differential of plus-7 in Group C play. That's not as good as Canada's goal differential of plus-9 in Group A after two games, but if the Americans can maul Team Germany in their final round-robin game on Sunday, and if Canada has a low-scoring game against France that same day, it's still possible the U.S. locks up the No. 1 seed.\n\nAnd conversely, it's still possible that the States wobble and wind up behind the powerhouse Canadians and end up with a less favorable quarterfinal matchup.\n\nBut one thing is clear: Swayman has probably played his final game in these Olympics.\n\nFirst of all, the Boston Bruins veteran goalie gave up a goal to Danish defenseman Nicholas B. Jensen that was shot from center ice. He told reporters post-game he didn't see the puck and that it was a flash screen.\n\n\"It was just the perfect height, right between the stands and board level,\" he said. \"I truly lost it… No matter how they go in, you have to step up and stop the next one.\"\n\nAs the crowd in Italy gasped at Swayman's miscue, Jensen's goal gave Team Denmark a 2-1 lead.\n\nThen, with three seconds left in the second period, after the U.S. scored three unanswered goals, Denmark defenseman Phillip Bruggisser took a slapshot from the top of the zone that beat Swayman as well. It's possible J.T. Miller screened him when he went for the block, but shots from low-danger areas like that should be fairly routine stops.\n\nMaple Leafs' Matthews, Jets' Hellebuyck Must Lead Team USA To No. 1 Seed Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews and Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck starred in Team USA's first win. They'll need to keep it up when they play to build a large enough goal differential to clinch the No. 1 overall seed over Canada.\n\nTeam Denmark's scoring showed the Americans how much tightening up they need to do before the stakes of the Games get significantly higher.\n\nThat almost certainly means Hellebuyck will be the go-to netminder for the U.S. until further notice, although that was probably the plan anyway. After tomorrow, there aren't any back-to-back games for Team USA, which clinched Group C with the win.\n\nThat doesn't mean the road ahead for Team America will be easier. It could turn out to be considerably tougher, with a possible showdown against Team Sweden in the cards if the U.S. are the No. 2 seed and if the Swedes win their qualifying match.\n\nThe good vibes of the Americans' first game quickly evaporated in Game 2 against the Danes. In the end, the result went their way, but if their first game unfolded like a pleasant dream, their second game was a cold wakeup call that they have to show urgency against any team, no matter how their opponents look on paper.\n\nDon't get it twisted – the Americans still have a lot to like about their Olympics thus far. And the brief stretch of adversity they faced on Saturday may be exactly what they need to thrive when the games matter most. No team has a flawless road to a gold medal performance, and Team USA learned against Denmark that you need to put in the work and earn every 'W' that puts you any closer to the Olympic podium.\n\nFighting your way through rough spots – and emerging stronger on the other side of it – is the hallmark of every champion. We'll see how the U.S. reacts to this close call, but for now, at least, their destiny is very much in their hands.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "The Brazilian Women's Under-20 Team has already turned the page and began preparations for the next phase of the South American Championship in Paraguay this Saturday (14). After the classic match against Argentina, the coaching staff led a session focused on fine-tuning, with an emphasis on details that can be decisive in games. According to coach Camila, the team approaches each commitment as a decision, and the work from now on will be directed towards raising the level in all aspects of the game.\n\n\"From now on, the focus is entirely on the details. That's how you play a final. You play to win, and you win in whatever way possible, whether it's technically, tactically, physically, mentally, or with grit. We will work on these details to place each game within this final structure and give our best game by game,\" she emphasized.\n\nThe session held a day after the match against Argentina aimed primarily at adjusting the offensive performance, especially in the final third of the field. Despite the good volume of play presented, the staff identified points to be adjusted.\n\n\"The focus was on the details. We had a very high volume of finishing and reaching the final third. So we worked on the final pass and finishing, which are fine-tuning adjustments at this moment. Our offensive volume was very good, and we also worked on the reaction after losing possession and defensive balance. These are details we will continue to adjust,\" she explained.\n\nAnother factor that has required special attention from the coaching staff is the intense heat in Paraguay. The high temperatures directly influence the training planning and load management. Additionally, the staff sought to balance the players' playing time during the first phase, ensuring that the squad is physically prepared for the decisive sequence of the tournament.\n\n\"We faced a very hot preparation here in Paraguay, a different heat than what we were used to. We had to pay a lot of attention to hydration, load management, and also the exposure time of the athletes to the sun. It was a work built together with the health and performance unit to ensure they reach this second stage with less wear and in the best conditions,\" Camila stated.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Every starting quarterback from the 2025 season was ranked. So where did the Indianapolis Colts' three starters land?",
    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts had three different quarterbacks start games this past season. So, where did each of them land in NFL.com's starting quarterback rankings?\n\nNick Shook recently ranked all 63 quarterbacks who made a start last season. Based on their play in the regular season and playoffs, he then listed those quarterbacks from 1 to 63, placing them in tiers.\n\nMaking a big jump and landing in Tier 2 was Daniel Jones. For more on Jones' ranking and why Shook placed him there, you can find that here.\n\nBut what about Phillip Rivers and Riley Leonard?\n\nRivers came in at No. 36 and in Tier 5. A few others in this category included Kyler Murray, Joe Flacco, Spencer Rattler, and others.\n\n\"The 44-year-old proved he could still succeed with his brain; his arm, however, showed his age,\" Shook wrote.\n\nIn his three games, Rivers completed 63% of his passes for 544 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nThe Colts, unfortunately, did not win any of those games, but Rivers routinely put the offense into favorable looks pre-snap and helped that unit sustain drives and hang around in games, giving Indianapolis a chance.\n\nThe Colts needed stability at quarterback, and Rivers was able to provide that.\n\nLeonard, meanwhile, came in at No. 47 in these rankings and in Tier 6. Carson Wentz, Shedeur Sanders, Russell Wilson, and others were in this tier.\n\n\"Riley Leonard made one start and was shockingly effective, slinging the ball around the yard as if there was no tomorrow in a high-scoring loss to Houston,\" Shook wrote.\n\nAs Shook said, Leonard's start against Houston -- a very good defense -- in Week 18 was quite good. He completed 21-of-34 passes for 270 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nIt wasn't perfect by any means, but Leonard always found a way to respond. Could he be the Colts' backup quarterback in 2026?\n\nAnthony Richardson would appear in a couple of games before being placed on IR, but did not make any starts. So he did not qualify for Shook's rankings.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Every starting QB from 2025 ranked: Where do Colts QBs land?",

    "title": "Women's golf's big 2025 question is already getting answered in 2026",
    "description": "The 2025 season left the LPGA and women's golf with a conundrum.",
    "fullText": "Craig Kessler knew there was no easy answer, even if conventional wisdom said otherwise.\n\n“No silver bullets to creating stars,” the LPGA commissioner said at the CME Group Tour Championship in November.\n\nAt the end of a year defined by parity, the LPGA and women’s golf faced a conundrum as it looked to find its breakthrough moment: Is it better to have one or two superstars win and win a lot, or are parity and depth the answer?\n\nOne of Kessler’s top priorities as he took over as commissioner was to find a way to create and market his stars. The way, he said, was to identify those who connect with fans, are willing to show up outside the ropes to build their brand and whose play meets the necessary level.\n\n“You have the best players, you have the most marketable players, and you have the ones who are actually willing to lean in and do the work,” Kessler said. “It’s the handful of players at the center of that Venn diagram that we are going to invest our resources against in order to create global superstars and create that player and fan connection.”\n\nOf course, it’s no secret who the needles are in women’s golf at the moment. It’s the same two players who Kessler specifically mentioned by name as players who have done things outside of golf to raise their star profile: Nelly Korda and Charley Hull.\n\nWhile the outside-the-ropes stuff is important, Korda and Hull winning more, and doing so on the biggest stages in 2026, would be the most beneficial thing for the LPGA and women’s golf.\n\nKorda went winless in 2025 after her seven-win 2024. Hull won once, capturing the Kroger after World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul four-putted on the 72nd hole. It’s not a surprise that the two biggest moments of the 2025 season were Korda’s Sunday charge at the U.S. Women’s Open and Hull’s final-round flurry at the AIG Women’s Open, both of which came up just short.\n\nA year in which Nelly and Charley win and win a lot would be the foundation for the climb toward a breakthrough that Kessler and all of the stakeholders in women’s golf envision.\n\nThat’s what made the controversial start to the LPGA’s season so head-scratching. Korda shot a sterling 64 on Saturday in chilly temperatures in Orlando to grab the lead. Everything was set up for the ideal Sunday, with the LPGA’s marquee star looking to snap a winless drought to open the 2026 season. But the decision to shorten the tournament to 54 holes due to the cold conditions meant Korda won the tournament on the driving range and won’t hit another shot for a month.\n\nKessler apologized for the way the decision was handled and communicated. He vowed to learn from it. There’s no doubt the controversial shortening overshadowed what could have been the ideal scenario for the LPGA’s opening weekend.\n\nBut Korda did still win. When she tees it up again, talk of a drought will be over, and she’ll be eyeing win No. 2 on the season.\n\n“I did a lot of good last year,” Korda said after her 54-hole win. “Just kind of wasn’t going my way. I guess I was just so focused on being really present, which I told myself to do that last year, too. Maybe the outside noise did make its way in a little bit more than I wanted to. I learned a lot.\n\n“Just very happy to get the first win of the year, and hopefully that leads into a great year.”\n\nAnd on Saturday, women’s golf’s other needle mover fired a final-round 65 to storm back and win the PIF Saudi Ladies International on the Ladies European Tour.\n\nHull birdied six of the final eight holes at Riyadh Golf Club to nip Akie Iwai and Cassandra Alexander by one.\n\n“It feels great,” Hull said after securing the win. “Wow, it’s gone a bit too fast today. I was only two-under through nine holes and then I made a charge on the back nine. It was funny because last time I was around here my boyfriend said to me go out and make loads of birdies to begin with. He said to me last night, ‘Make loads of birdies coming in, you love chasing.’ And that’s what I did.”\n\nThe LPGA’s confounding decision to shorten the season-opening Tournament of Champions turned a Korda dream start into a question-filled debacle.\n\nBut on February 14, both Korda and Hull, the two biggest stars in women’s golf, have both won. Hull will tee it up again in two weeks at the HSBC Women’s World Championship, while Korda will return to action at the Fortinet Founders Cup in the middle of March. There’s a chance that one or both could have multiple wins by the time the first major rolls around at the end of April.\n\nThe answer to the LPGA’s stars vs. depth question was always going to answer itself. Korda and Hull already appear well on their way to delivering the expected answer just one month into the 2026 season.\n\nThe post Women’s golf’s big 2025 question is already getting answered in 2026 appeared first on Golf.",

    "description": "Collin Morikawa approached the third round of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am with a winning mindset",
    "fullText": "PEBBLE BEACH — Collin Morikawa sounds desperate to win again on the PGA Tour. On an increasingly blustery Saturday on the Monterey Peninsula, he gave himself a chance in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with a largely flawless 10-under-par 62 at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Apparently, it’s all a state of mind.\n\nHaving just one victory since he captured the 2021 Open Championship, Morikawa is rather frustrated with his results, and you can’t blame him after he won two of the first eight majors in which he appeared and had five wins in less than three full seasons since he turned pro in 2019. But after a career-low effort at Pebble Beach born of some exceptional iron play, he has a chance to get back on the track he thinks he belongs.\n\n“The problem is the results matter sometimes, and for me in this world after the past year, three years, whatever you want to call it, I just haven't had the results I've wanted,” the California native said. “But I know I'm making the right strides, I know I'm inching towards the right direction. It's just I just haven't seen this momentum to be able to go out and play a low round.”\n\nHe had a lowest round on Saturday, and it was about as stress-free as you could want it. After beginning the third round eight shots behind co-leaders Akshay Bhatia and Ryo Hisatsune, Morikawa rattled off 11 birdies and climbed within two shots of Bhatia through 54 holes of this $20 million signature event. Morikawa, tied at 17-under 199 with Sepp Straka and Jake Knapp, hit all 18 greens in regulation and converted just 58 feet of putts—a metric that exemplifies just how dialed in he was on his approaches. He gained nearly nine strokes (8.885) in that discipline, best in the field.\n\n“Ball was going where I wanted, putts were dropping when I needed them. It was just never got ahead of myself,” said Morikawa, 29, who won the 2020 PGA Championship a few hours north of here at Harding Park in San Francisco. “This game is stressful enough, and I think I make it even more stressful for whatever reason. But I was able to just really take it a shot at a time and just enjoy the round when I could.”\n\nRanked 19th in the world, Morikawa won the 2023 ZOZO Championship in Japan, but in January that year he lost a six-shot lead to Jon Rahm at The Sentry at Kapalua, and at the end of 2021 he surrendered a five-stroke lead to Viktor Hovland at the Hero World Challenge. Those will give you scar tissue. Also an ulcer.\n\nWhen the task of winning is so difficult and chances so few, there isn’t a player on tour who doesn’t feel a gnawing exasperation with the game. But it’s more pronounced for a player like Morikawa who enjoyed tremendous early success. He hasn’t had a top-10 finish since a T-8 at the Rocket Classic in June. He began this year missing the cut at the Sony Open in Hawaii and was T-54 at last week’s WM Phoenix Open.\n\n“Look, I'm very hard on myself,” he admitted. “I think we all are, but I'm very, very hard. You ask anyone on my team, I can get down on myself pretty quickly because I know there's just really fine margins out here. And I want to go back not necessarily to the player I was, but just kind of use everything I've learned over the last six, seven years and just put that into the golfer I am today. It's very hard to do, it really is.”\n\nConversations with his mental coach, Rick Sensinghaus, recently have usually segued to things he might have been doing to stunt his own aspirations. On Friday, after shooting a 68 at Pebble that was filled with missed chances, Sensinghaus managed to instill in Morikawa a renewed sense of priorities.\n\n“He reminded me yesterday when I first came out and turned pro, I didn't care about honestly making cuts or top 20s; I came out to win,” Morikawa said. “When he told me that yesterday, there was that mindset switch going into today. I wanted to come out and win, win the weekend, win the tournament.\n\n“It's a small mindset adjustment and without him telling me that, who knows what I would have shot today. But I'm out here to win. I've got to set that mindset at the beginning of the day, at the beginning of the week and now I think we've given ourselves at least a chance come tomorrow.”",

    "fullText": "Pitching was expected to be Arizona’s strength this season, but so far it’s been the source of several poor performances already.\n\nThe Wildcats’ bullpen couldn’t hold a 5-2 lead, giving up five runs in the bottom of the 7th inning of a 7-6 loss to Oregon State on Saturday afternoon at Surprise Stadium. The UA is 0-2 for the second year in a row after losing its opener 10-7 to Stanford on Friday.\n\nArizona scored four in the top of the 6th to take the lead, sending nine batters to the plate against OSU relievers after starter Ethan Kleinschmidt struck out eight over the first five frames. But when the UA turned to its pen in relief of Smith Bailey—who allowed two runs and three hits with four strikeouts and two walks over six innings—it was equally rough.\n\nUSF transfer Corey Kling retired only one of the four batters he faced, then freshman Benton Hickman hit the first two he faced before giving up the game-winning 2-run single and Tulane transfer allowed an RBI hit.\n\nArizona got the go-ahead run on in the top of the 9th after Tony Lira drove in Maddox Mihalakis with a single to get within one. But Andrew Cain and Nate Novitske followed with strikeouts to end it.\n\nThe UA struck out 18 times, this after recording 15 strikeouts against Stanford.\n\nLira was 3 for 5 while Mathis Meurant drove in two for the Wildcats, who will try to avoid a winless opening weekend Sunday at 4 p.m. MT against Michigan. Right-hander Collin McKinney will start for the UA.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter missing out on Cam Thomas (he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks), Haywood Highsmith was among the next best available buyout targets for the Golden State Warriors.\n\nUnfortunately for the Dubs, the Phoenix Suns ensured that was no longer the case.\n\n“Free agent forward Haywood Highsmith has agreed to a multiyear deal with the Phoenix Suns,” ESPN’s Shams Charania reported Saturday.\n\n“Highsmith considered multiple playoff teams before reaching an agreement with the Suns on Saturday, sources said. Known as a gritty, two-way player when healthy, he joins a Phoenix team that is 32-23 at the All-Star break -- 1.5 games out of the 5th seed.”\n\nHighsmith could have been a beneficial role player with the Warriors this season. Sure, the former Philadelphia 76ers forward hasn’t played yet this year due to a knee injury and is undoubtedly a risky investment.\n\nHowever, with the Warriors having limited buyout options and Highsmith emerging as a useful two-way wing the past couple of seasons, there’s no question that Golden State missed out on the 29-year-old.\n\nDuring his last full NBA campaign (2024-25), the Wheeling product averaged 6.5 points and 3.4 rebounds per game with the Miami Heat, shooting 45.8% from the field and 38.2% from three-point land.\n\nAfter Charania’s report, the Warriors will have no choice but to direct their attention to different buyout targets.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers get good Walker Kessler trade news",

He had won the contest in 2023 and 2024.\n\nLillard spent the prior two seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks after spending the first 11 years of his career with the Portland Trail Blazers. Lillard suffered a torn Achilles tendon last season in the playoffs while with the Bucks.\n\nLillard scored 29 points in the final round and set the score that Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns needed to beat.

    "title": "Sunday Matters: Why you need to see the PGA Tour's Pebble Beach finale",
    "description": "The PGA Tour's first signature event of the season is coming to a close along one of golf's most picturesque backdrops.",
    "fullText": "The PGA Tour's first signature event of the 2026 season was already shaping up as tremendous theater. Now, the stage will also be an integral part of the production.\n\nAs wind and rain threaten the Monterey Peninsula on Sunday, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro‑Am will move up its final‑round start, turning the day into a battle not just among players, but against the elements and the clock.\n\nHere are the biggest storylines you need to know heading into the final round of play. Here's why Sunday matters:\n\nHold on to your hats, folks, and anything else you don't want to lose in the bay: Nastier weather is expected at Pebble Beach on Sunday, so tee times have been adjusted to beat the brunt of the storms.\n\nTee times have been adjusted to run from 7:22 to 9:45 a.m. local time, with threesomes starting off split tees.\n\nHow come? A broad area of low pressure is expected to move toward the Monterey Peninsula on Sunday, bringing showers that will increase in both coverage and intensity throughout the day. Conditions are expected to deteriorate further by evening, with rain transitioning to a steady, heavy downpour.\n\nWind may present the greater challenge. Sustained southerly winds of 15–25 mph, with gusts reaching up to 35 mph, are possible, particularly after 11 a.m.\n\nAfter going the first 45 holes without a bogey and building a healthy lead, Akshay Bhatia played some prevent defense on the back nine during Saturday's third round, and while he'll still have a two-stroke advantage to start the day on Sunday, he let the pack inch closer.\n\nThe two-time PGA Tour winner (2023 Barracuda Championship, 2024 Valero Texas Open) sits at 19 under and is gunning for the biggest victory of his professional career.\n\nBhatia closed the round as the prohibitive favorite with odds of +175 to win.\n\nNobody wanted to keep playing more on Saturday than Collin Morikawa, who finished with a scintillating 62, including birdies on five of the last six holes.\n\nBut Sepp Straka and Jake Knapp cruised along as well, and all three players sit at +470 to win heading into Sunday.\n\n\"Just understanding it's going to be a grind,\" Knapp said when asked what it will take on Sunday. \"It's not going to probably be pretty at all times. You're going to have some funky stuff happen and just have to deal with it. I think anytime you get bad elements and stuff like that you just have to do a good job of not letting it bug you. Just understand that you're probably going to make some bogeys. If it rains, probably going to get some weird water balls, so just kind of roll with it.\"\n\nThrough three rounds, Hideki Matsuyama has been the epitome of consistency with three straight rounds of 67. But sitting just four shots off the lead and without a ton of traffic above him on the leaderboard, it's absolutely plausible that the 33-year-old makes this event his 12th PGA Tour victory.\n\nHis +1900 odds to win sure look appealing with the weather likely to create chaos on Sunday.\n\nCan Scottie Scheffler, who has posted 17 top-10 finishes, climb from outside the top 20 at Pebble Beach and keep his streak alive?\n\nIt won't be easy. Although he fired a 67 in the third round, he sits in a tie for 22nd.\n\n\"I feel like I'm close to doing some good stuff,\" he said on Saturday. \"It's just around this place it's challenging in some spots. Like it's hard to tell how firm and how soft some of the greens have been. Most have been pretty soft, but there's a few, there's a shot I hit in today, it actually bounced forward with a wedge and I just couldn't figure out how it happened. Hit a couple where I just kind of misjudged how far the ball's going to come back.\"\n\nScheffler insists his streak doesn't matter to him, but it's certainly something he should be proud of. Billy Casper was the last player to make the top 10s in 17 tournaments in a row, but that streak ended in 1965.\n\n\"I mean, I think 17 straight top-10s is a good result from a lot of consistent play,\" Scheffler said. \"Outside of that, I could not care any less.\"\n\nOf course, with Scheffler's ability, anything can happen.\n\n\"I don't want to rule anything out for myself. You never want to limit yourself,\" he said. \"I'd obviously like to be in a better position on the leaderboard. But yeah, with crazy weather, crazy things can happen and we'll see what I can do (Sunday).\"\n\nPicking a signature hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links is sort of like trying to pick the most beautiful car in the Ferrari dealership.\n\nThe 18th, with waves splashing along its left side in Stillwater Cove, is the best finishing hole in golf. Jack Nicklaus has said the greatest second shot in golf is over the gorge on the majestic eighth hole. They're both stunners, but the seventh hole is like nothing else.\n\nWith golf courses being stretched and pulled to combat big hitters, the seventh, at about 100 yards, is a downhill test of nerves.\n\nIt might also be the most beautiful hole in golf, with waves crashing on the rock outcrop to the right, wispy grasses bobbing in the breeze on the hillside and Carmel Bay and Point Lobos State Natural Reserve in the distance. Seagulls and pelicans sail through the air above sailboats and luxury yachts anchored in the cove.\n\nIf you suffer from high blood pressure, hang out on the seventh at Pebble Beach for an hour and you'll be cured.\n\nWhile many, like Shane Lowry, had little trouble aiming at the stick on Saturday, the uptick in wind speed could present a tremendous change in how comfortable players are on the elevated tee.\n\nNot all PGA Tour courses are created equal, and this is a special week for the PGA Tour. The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am is contested on two of the top 10 courses the Tour plays each year, not counting major championships.\n\nPebble Beach Golf Links, as always, is the star of the AT&T broadcast. Perched above coves leading into the Pacific Ocean, the scenery is a welcome blast of sunshine for the legions of golf fans stuck somewhere in the cold. The course also ranks among the top 10 classic courses in the United States. Even most golfers who have never experienced Pebble Beach in person feel a connection forged by years of television coverage.\n\nWhich states have the most courses among the top 10 courses played by the PGA Tour? In all, California shows up on that list three times. In fact, California has the top three. Next up is Georgia with two top-10 Tour courses, and that’s not counting Augusta National and the Masters because the list looks only at regular events managed by the Tour – Augusta National operates the major championship on its own.\n\nThe scenery is breathtaking, but only a few homes dot the fairways at Pebble Beach. Even defending champion Rory McIlroy has a thing for some of the homes on the course. His favorite? It's on No. 10.\n\n\"I love that house at the back of the green,\" he said. \"It's like the prettiest house in the world.\"\n\nOur Adam Schupak took a look at some of the mansions of Pebble Beach and the celebrities who live in them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Sunday Matters: Why you need to see PGA Tour's Pebble Beach finale",

    "description": "The former New York Giants head coach faced a backlash after discussing the intersection of child-rearing and football.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterbacks coach Joe Judge released a statement Saturday after a quote from a court appearance went viral, insisting that his comments about fathers of newborns prioritizing their sleep were \"taken out of context.\"\n\nThe comments were given Thursday during the hearing for Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' request for an injunction to play a sixth season of college football. That injunction was granted Friday.\n\nOne clip of Judge's testimony took off in particular, in which Judge recounts telling the partners of players with young children that they need to prevent those children from waking them up in the middle of the night.\n\nNEW: Ole Miss coach Joe Judge tells pregnant partners of players during the season that the father has to play good football.\n\n“He needs to be in another room, detached… he ain’t waking up for midnight feedings.” pic.twitter.com/LQG7t0fQtX\n\n— College Transfer Portal (@CollegeFBPortal) February 12, 2026\n\nNotably, that clip identifies Judge as an Ole Miss coach and refers to unspecified players, but what it does not mention is the conversation at the time was about Judge's experience dealing with sleep disorders while in NFL player development with the New England Patriots.\n\nIn his statement, Judge clarified that the conversations about playing football while raising a child were only in the NFL, never the collegiate level:\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so l'd like to provide some clarity. In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal.\"\n\nJudge worked under Bill Belichick from 2012 to 2019, became head coach of the New York Giants in 2020, then moved back to the Patriots after his firing in 2022. He joined Ole Miss in 2024 and currently holds the titles of quarterbacks coach and \"head coach of offense\" (John David Baker is the offensive coordinator under head coach Pete Golding).\n\nIn the interest of clarity and not taking Judge out of context, here is the larger exchange about dealing with NFL players with sleep disorders:\n\nQ: \"Can a sleep disorder affect a player's ability?\"\n\nQ: \"Has that occurred in your past where you have encountered players with sleep disorders?\"\n\nQ: \"And what did you do for those players?\"\n\nA: \"Well, we got them the CPAP machines. We tracked their sleep. We made sure they were evening out their sleep cycles, that they're properly rested. That was several players over the course of years.\n\n\"And then there was also the players that we would have to educate — this is always a tough conversation to have. It's not a popular opinion, this is the truth, we would have to educate significant others who may have been pregnant during the season, or were going to have a baby during the season, and you'd have to educate them on — you have this baby in the middle of the season, that father has to play good football. It's a day-by-day production business. He has to be ready to perform and go out there and play, and when I say that is, you need to let him sleep. He needs to be in another room, detached.\n\n\"You have to explain to the mother, 'Listen, he ain't waking up for the midnight feedings. After the season, he's full metal jacket. You can do whatever you want with him, he'll change every diaper. In season, he's got to have a different priority.\n\n\"Now, there were examples to use from that. We had some older veteran players — I can or can't share names if you want me too — who had multiple children who would sleep in other rooms. Their wives would bring in family or a nursing aid to help throughout the night, and those players continue to play high-level football. We had other players who are young who quite simply did what every other father in the world does, waking up, changing diapers, doing feedings, and led to injuries, led to soft-tissue injuries, not being rested, not being recovered, not being ready to roll.\"\n\nQ: \"That never occurred to me, that newborns can affect injuries on the football field. But who had to deliver that message?\"\n\nQ: \"And to whom did you deliver the message?\"\n\nA: \"About as good as you'd expect (laughs).\"",

    "description": "A fast start and tremendous defensive work carried the No. 7 Bremen girls basketball team to a Class 2A regional crown at LaPorte Saturday.",
    "fullText": "LAPORTE ― The Bremen girls basketball team was a heavy favorite to cut down the regional nets Saturday evening.\n\nThe Lions made sure to do just that too.\n\nBremen rode a dominating start to sideline Andrean 61-32 in a Class 2A regional game at LaPorte High School on Feb. 14.\n\nThe No. 7 Lions, who opened the game up 12-0, improved to 23-2 with the fourth regional title in program history.\n\nUpset! Marquette Catholic girls basketball loses IHSAA regional to Fremont\n\nMore Bremen hoops: Chase Devine wills Bremen boys basketball to the conference championship\n\nBremen advances to the four-team semi-state next Saturday, Feb. 21. The bracket and location were not announced as of Saturday night.\n\nAndrean, which had 22 turnovers and just eight total field goals in the lopsided loss, finished at 11-14.\n\nThe Bremen senior class was its usual outstanding self Saturday. Guard Emma Lawmaster led the way with 17 points, while classmate and guard Eliana Grubbs scored 16 points, senior forward Natalie Harmon eight and senior guard Emma Lawmaster seven.\n\nThe laser-focused Lions made sure they would not leave the regional round disappointed this time around. Bremen, after winning a Class 3A regional crown in 2024, fell to Whitko 53-44 in the 2A regional a season ago to finish at 24-3.\n\n\"We know that it's win now or we will not play again,\" said Grubbs matter-of-factly following the blowout win as she gripped a piece of the championship net tightly. \"We were ready today. We were locked in at practice all week. We were pretty confident, but we know that we have to keep a level head too.\"\n\nAndrean, which entered play averaging just 39 ppg., turned the ball over on its first four possessions of the game. The Lions, using enough full court pressure to completely stifle the 59ers, led 12-0. Bremen led 14-7 after the opening period.\n\n\"Our girls did an outstanding job defensively today,\" said Bremen coach Alex Robinson. \"We knew this was a good matchup versus our defense. Our girls have played in these regional games twice before and they knew how important it was to start fast. A 12-0 start was just what we wanted.\n\n\"Our identity is our seniors. They are so poised and unselfish. They know what it's like to have a different feeling than today (the regional loss in 2025). They have just put a lot of work in to accomplish this. Their commitment has been just outstanding.\"\n\nAndrean got within 14-10 early in the second period. The Lions then closed the half with a 16-7 run to lead 30-17 at intermission. Grubbs had 11 first half points while Andrean had 13 turnovers and made just one two-point basket in the first half. That one field goal came with just 12 seconds to play in the opening half. Andrean did hit four treys in the first half.\n\nBremen put the foot on the gas in the third period to blow the game open. The Lions outscored Andrean 16-5 in the stanza to take a 46-22 lead. Kincaid netted seven points in the period and Andrean shot just 2-of-12 from the field.\n\n\"We were really motivated today,\" said Kincaid, who like Grubbs went over 1,000 career points earlier this season. \"We are going to do whatever it takes. We were pretty confident and pretty focused. We know that we cannot relax.\"\n\nThe Lions entered play Saturday allowing just 29 ppg.\n\n\"Every single person on our team does their job,\" said Kincaid of the defensive work of her team. \"Everyone puts in the work on the defensive end.\"\n\nThe Lions got great play defensively on the inside from the 5-10 Harmon, along with 6-2 junior Teegan Feathers and 6-0 sophomore Skylee Feathers.\n\n\"We knew our defense was going to lock them down,\" Grubbs said. \"We depend on them (Harmon and both Feathers) a lot. We say let them go into the trees.\"\n\nGrubbs, who will play at Cornerstone University, is the top scorer in a balanced Bremen offense at 14.3 ppg. Kincaid averages 14 ppg and Lawmaster 10 ppg.\n\nTeegan Feathers, the fifth starter, led her team with 10 rebounds. She also swatted away at least a handful of Andrean shot attempts.\n\n\"That's a dynamic we have with the rim protection back there,\" noted Robinson. \"We had a lot of blocked shots today and those are big.\"\n\nSkylee Feathers had six points for Bremen. The Lions two losses this season was a 46-39 overtime decision to Tippecanoe Valley and a 46-43 setback to Elkhart Christian Academy.\n\nAmdrea shot just 8-of-39 from the field. Sophomore Charlee Murphy and sophomore Delaney Myers each had seven points to pace the 59ers.\n\nAndrean loses just one senior in starter Lailona Staten. Staten, who had two points Saturday, was her team's top scorer on the season at 8 ppg.\n\nThis article originally appeared on South Bend Tribune: Bremen girls basketball beats Andrean for IHSAA 2A regional title",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStar guard Luka Doncic has missed the last four games for the Los Angeles Lakers due to a left hamstring strain.\n\nThe injury placed his status for the 2026 NBA All-Star game in doubt, but it sounds like that doubt can now be erased.\n\nWhile speaking with media members at All-Star weekend, Doncic revealed that he’s feeling better and plans to play a little bit, at least.\n\n“I feel pretty good. I’ve been working to get back,” Doncic said. “Obviously I wanted to play the last game, but it wasn’t possible. I was almost there. So I think I will play a little bit.”\n\nTechnically, playing in the exhibition could be a good way for Doncic to ease himself back into action, though he shouldn’t be expected to play many minutes, given the injury.\n\nIt will be the sixth career All-Star appearance for Doncic, who was selected as a starter for the game.\n\nOn the season, Doncic has appeared in 42 games for the Lakers and is averaging 32.8 points, 8.6 assists, 7.8 rebounds and 1.4 steals per performance.\n\nVictor Wembanyama sends clear message about being the next face of the NBA\n\nV.J.

    "description": "Purdue rolls to an easy win in Iowa City.",
    "fullText": "Hey, Purdue basketball is good again!\n\nA week ago we watched Purdue slog through an ugly home win against a very bad Oregon team in West Lafayette. It did not look good as the team prepared to head out on a two-game road trip. Nebraska was a top 10 team and Iowa had pushed Purdue earlier this year in West Lafayette.\n\nWell, after 85 minutes of basketball, the Boilermakers were mostly dominant for about 75 of those minutes and it gets the prize of two Tier 1 NET road victories.\n\nThis is the Purdue team we expected. Tonight it had virtually no problems as it jumped out to a 19-7 lead and never looked back. Unlike Tuesday, Purdue did trail in regulation. It was down 5-4 for about 16 seconds, so we can technically call this a come-from-behind win.\n\nCongrats to Matt Painter for his 250th career Big Ten win as a head coach. He is only the 4th such coach to reach that mark, joining Hall of Famers Tom Izzo, Bob Knight, and Gene Keady. He is well on track to pass Keady next season.\n\nBraden Smith gets back on track for the assists record with 10 on Tuesday and 12 tonight. He’d probably have a few more too if opn shots were hit. Tonight he passed Steve Blake for 6th on the all-time NCAA list and he has 980 for his career. Next up is Keith Jennings of East Tennessee State, who has 983. With three straight home games he is likely to become just the fifth Division I player with 1,000 career assists sometime in the next three games. He is averging just under 8.9 per game this season, and if he maintains that average Purdue will need to play five postseason games between the two tournaments to get the record. The FDU game is sitting there like a bomb, as it cost him at least one more game.\n\nHow about the game by Gicarri Harris! He was the main driver in opening up Purdue’s big early lead with three threes and an impressive dunk that led to an and-1.\n\nSimilar game for CJ Cox. Cox and Harris are the complimentary guys that, when they are hitting, Purdue is awfully difficult to beat. Tonight they combined for 28 points and 7 of 15 from three. Cox especially has played well in the second half on this road trip.\n\nTrey Kaufman-Renn as a rebounding machine these last two games have been huge. He had more scoring tonight with 12 points, but he grabbed 31 rebounds in two games. When he is a rebounding demon and Braden is dishing out 10+ assists this team is awfully good.\n\nMuch better night at the line going 16 of 20, though it is really 16 of 22 since the front end of two one-and-ones were missed.\n\nPurdue looked like it learned a bit from Tuesday. It kept the foot on the gas and actually worked clock while attacking the basket in the final three minutes.\n\nWhat we saw tonight is the exact formula Purdue needs if it is going to achieves all its goals this year. It needs to shoot 35-40% from three. It needs TKR to rebound like a mad bastard. It needs to continue challenging threes. It needs Cox and Harris to be great complimentary scorers. Do all those and we’re going to be very tough to beat.\n\nAbsolutely zero complaints in this one. We beat a solid NCAA Tournament team on its home floor by 21 points. Flawless.\n\nWe’re now in the home stretch. We have six regular season games left, and four of them are in the friendly confines of Mackey Arena. More importantly, we’re rounding into form right as the presumed No. 1 team in the country comes to West Lafayette. Tuesday is going to be a madhouse. It is why we love college basketball. A win, and Purdue is very much alive for its 27th Big Ten championship. Lose, and it is far from a bad loss, but at that point it likely becomes a scenario where we need to finish strong for a 2 seed.\n\nThe impressive thing is that Purdue passed this very tough two-game road trip with flying colors. Let’s get this one Tuesday night and make this a race.",

It's just brutal.\n\n\"It's hard to hit a putt like that with those conditions and with everything going on in your head.

Then the Wolfpack just gave the game away.\n\nWith 1:07 left, Lubin grabbed a rare offensive rebound and put it back in for a 76-69 Pack lead. NC State would not score again. Lubin turned it over, then Holloman turned it over, Copeland fouled with 27 seconds, but they missed, then Copeland got fouled with 17 seconds left and missed the front end of the 1 & 1, and with NC State holding a 2-point lead, at the 3 second mark Williams fouled the 3PT shooter. Washington made all three free throws for the final score, 77-76.\n\nThe Pack had this game won, and gave it away in the final minute\n\nMiami had 20 offensive rebounds resulting in 12 more FG attempts\n\nMatt Able had one of his better games and tied for the scoring lead with Lubin with 17\n\nVen Lubin led rebounding with 9",

    "fullText": "Ole Miss assistant coach and former Giants head coach Joe Judge made waves on Thursday with his testimony in the Trinidad Chambliss eligibility case. Judge is now trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube.\n\nOn Friday morning, Judge explained to PFT (in a message sent through PFT Live co-host Chris Simms) that his comments about educating spouses and significant others about the importance of letting players get their sleep when a newborn baby is in the house related to his time with NFL players, not college players. On Saturday, Judge provided a more lengthy statement about the distinction on Twitter.\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so I'd like to provide some clarity,\" Judge said. \"In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal lives.\"\n\nThe most obvious response to Judge's clarification is this: If his comments had no relevance to college athletes, why did he say what he said within the context of testimony in a case about the eligibility of a college football player?\n\nBeyond that, Judge's explanation that he would never diminish the commitment to family ignores the fact that, at the NFL level, he did.\n\nThe bigger point is this. Judge was working with Chambliss's lawyers in an effort to help him secure an extra year of eligibility. Ole Miss wants him back for another year, so that he can help them win as many games as possible. Judge, as a result, said what he believed he needed to say in order to make the case that the sleep issues arises arising from Chambliss's respiratory problem should qualify for a medical redshirt as to his 2022 season at Ferris State.\n\nIt was a strategy, a calculation aimed at helping Ole Mis get the player they want. In lieu of telling Chambliss's lawyers that making the point about shielding NFL players from responsibility to care for newborns during football season was a bridge too far, Judge was all in with whatever it took to help win the case.\n\nJudge is now trying to have it both ways. He made the point he made to help Ole Miss get Chambliss for another year. Now, Judge wants to avoid the consequences of what he said by saying he never said anything like that to college players, only NFL players.\n\nIt would be better for Judge to just accept the win in the Chambliss case and take the heat for what he said. Judge told the court the story about football players and infants and sleep because he thought it would help Ole Miss get Chambliss for the 2026 season. It worked. It's now too late for Judge to try to say he didn't say what he said.",

    "fullText": "AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Australia has won the New Zealand leg of the SailGP series, though racing was overshadowed by a crash involving New Zealand and France on Saturday which left a sailor from each team with serious injuries.\n\nDriver Tom Slingsby steered the Australian Flying Roos to victory in the three-boat final Sunday ahead of Spain and Britain. Britain won the first event of the series in Perth, Australia and now shares the overall series lead with the Australians.\n\nOrganizers decided to break the fleet into two groups for racing on the second day Sunday because of expected high winds. For the first time in SailGP history 13 boats took part in racing Saturday and congestion on a narrow course might have been a factor in the crash which saw the New Zealand and French boats extensively damaged.\n\nLouis Sinclair, a “grinder” who works the winches on the New Zealand boat, suffered compound fractures to both legs when the New Zealand Black Foils and France collided at almost 90 kmh (56 mph).\n\nIn a statement Sunday, the New Zealand team said \"Sinclair has had successful surgery on his right leg overnight after injuries suffered during yesterday’s collision with France.\n\n“The medical team involved in Sinclair’s treatment have been fantastic and are pleased with the results of the surgery and are positive about his ongoing recovery.”\n\nTeam New Zealand said “a comprehensive review of yesterday’s incident will be conducted in coordination with SailGP.”\n\nFrance strategist Manon Audinet also was injured in the crash. The French team said Audinet suffered abdominal injuries.\n\n“She was thrown forward on impact and actually broke the steering wheel of the French boat,” a team statement said. “The entire Team France has Manon Audinet and Louis Sinclair in their thoughts and stands fully alongside them during this time.”\n\nNew Zealand and France now face a tight schedule to repair their boats in time for the next leg of the series in Sydney in two weeks time. France suffered damage to one hull but the New Zealand boat seems to be far more extensively damaged.\n\nRacing on Sunday took place in gusty conditions ahead of an impending thunderstorm and the highest speed recorded by any of the matching 50-foot catamarans was 101.99 kmh (63 mph).\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

    "description": "Here's everything Todd Golden said after Florida basketball beat the Kentucky Wildcats at home on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "Another game, another win for Florida basketball after beating the Kentucky Wildcats inside the O'Connell Center on Saturday afternoon, 92-83. That makes it five-straight victories for the Gators as the regular-season schedule begins to fade into March Madness.\n\nXaivian Lee led the charge as his late-season surge finally showed the promise he brought when he arrived via the transfer portal from Princeton, dropping a game-high 22 points along with three assists and two rebounds. Urban Klavžar added 19 as well to bolster a resurgent Florida backcourt.\n\nFollowing the Valentine's Day triumph, Todd Golden talked about his team's effort with the sports media. Here is what he had to say.\n\n\"Yeah, you know, really good college basketball game. I thought we did a really good job first half, getting off to a great start. I thought we kind of lost our edge a little bit in the middle of the first half.\n\n\"I heard you guys talking about the Rueben three, we kind of were lackadaisical with the ball in transition a little bit when I thought we could have maybe knocked them out. But credit to Kentucky, I thought they did a good job fighting, cutting that lead. They went on a 10-0 run on the heels of that, and nip and tuck a little bit early of the first 10 minutes of the second half.\n\n\"But I thought we did a really good job, relentless getting on the glass, you know, especially last 10 minutes of the game and making sure we got second-chance opportunities, making sure we got to the line. And our defense was great early, not great in the middle, but pretty good late guarding the line and making sure that we didn't give up any sort of run down the stretch.\n\n\"So, great win. I don't think we played our best, but we played well enough.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, he's playing great, right? I mean, he was fantastic at Georgia, he was great at Vanderbilt. He's stacked some really good games over the last couple of weeks, and I thought he was fantastic today. Just got off to a great start knocking shots down.\n\n\"To your point, he did a really good job of playing with great patience in the paint, playing off two, making good decisions. And he gave us a big lift. Obviously, him and Urby shooting the ball the way they did allowed us to win the game the way we did today.\"\n\n\"I thought Micah was great. I thought, you know, obviously the stat sheet doesn't tell the story minus the plus/minus. You know, it felt really good with him out there. He did a great job defensively, cleaned up on the glass.\n\n\"And obviously Rueben is, I would argue, the best defensive player in America, and Micah hasn't been any at that level clearly, but I thought today he did a great job of not allowing any fall-off when he was in the game, and that allowed us to play really well when he was in there and go plus-14.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, a big part of our scout was to make it tough on obviously Otega and 'Zel, and they went 12-for-35 combined from the field, one for nine from three. I thought we did a really good job of defending those guys.\n\n\"They were trying to score, and we knew that, and so we wanted to keep two on the ball when they were getting downhill, kind of force them into those play-making decisions. And overall, it was really good for us. And the things that hurt us were other things.\n\n\"Like, I thought we did a really poor job on Chandler, letting him get some space. I thought we did a poor job on Dioubate, letting him get left.\n\n\"So big-picture-wise, I thought scouting-wise we did a decent job in the main parts of what we were trying to accomplish, but the auxiliary stuff really bothered us and it allowed Kentucky to stay in the game.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, I think he's, as I've told you guys, he's a great player. People want to poke at things about our team or about our personnel when we're not doing everything perfectly, but you look at the big picture, and how many guys in America would you trade Alex Condon for?\n\n\"I can't think of any at that spot. And he's been a huge winner for us. And the double-double, huge, but it's his defense, it's his winning plays, it's his effort that's unmatched, and it's why he's such a great player.\"\n\n\"I mean, we lost our first year here when we were a little banged up. They got us in a great game when they had Sheppard and Rob Dillingham. We led most of the game and they won it late. Aaron Bradshaw hit a big three. That was interesting. And then this was the next time we got them in here and we took care of business.\n\n\"Obviously, won there two years ago. So, you know, it is what it is, and just the way the schedule shaped up, and now we're gonna have a really tough challenge going back to Rupp.\n\n\"Obviously, Kentucky is playing a lot better. There's no doubt about that. I stick by what I said, their ability and the fact that they have some guys out and the rotation has shrunk has allowed people to get comfortable in their roles, and they're playing a lot better for it.\n\n\"So, there's a reason why they were able to climb into second after a tough starting league play. So they're playing some good ball. They're talented.\n\n\"Obviously, a $22 million roster. They're physical, they're big and I expect them to do well the rest of the year. They're a really good team.\"\n\n\"Listen, our crowd is incredible. And we had to earn it when we got the job here in terms of getting kind of the excitement back in the O'Dome. But as I said before, this is why it's a great place. People really appreciate winning, and they want to be a part of it. They want to be around it.\n\n\"And when we've given them a semblance of hope about our program, they've shown up for us and supported us in a big way. And today was no different. It was a great crowd, great atmosphere. There's a reason why college basketball is what it is right now.\n\n\"It's games like this on ABC that make it special. And this was a great game.\"\n\n\"We're trending. I don't necessarily have a goal of where we want to be at a certain point. We just want to get better, and we've definitely done that over the course of conference play. We've improved in a lot of different ways. Our bench has really stepped up and given us the ability to play eight and be complete that way. And we've been pretty consistent.\n\n\"Obviously, we didn't play well against Auburn in here, and that one will sting us a little bit, but we haven't lost since that game. And besides Missouri, in a game where I didn't think we played great, and they're improving. They're a very good team. They won on the road at Kentucky. They won on the road at Texas A&M earlier in the week.\n\n\"So, you know, they're starting to hit their stride, but we're getting there. We're not all the way. I thought today we took a step back in some of the areas that we had been growing in, but we're also getting a lot better in some areas that I didn't expect us to maybe jump in.\n\n\"It means everything to me, to be honest. The love that we have for those guys is immeasurable. I think they changed a lot of people's lives during their time here in Gainesville. And they're great dudes. They're a great representation of our program, and obviously led us to a national championship.\n\n\"And a lot of guys want to go to the Bahamas, or they want to go to Cabo or Miami, and the fact that these guys came to be with us. They were here yesterday in practice; they sat in with us during film. They were here at shootaround today.\n\n\"Obviously, they got a well-deserved moment of recognition sitting there courtside. And it's just incredible, man. Nobody can ever take away from us what we did together, and I anticipate that relationship with the university being strong for a long time.\"\n\n\"I'm never going to say that a loss benefits us in that sense, but I will say that we responded the right way from it. You have to tip your crap. I thougth Auburn played really well. We didn't have our best that day. It can happen.\n\n\"This league's really good. There's a lot of really talented teams. What we've been able to do ... I think is pretty incredible. We're winning most every game by double digits. We're doing it comfortably. We're guarding at an elite level. I think our offense and defense have been top five nationally over the last 10 games, so we are turning into a complete team.\n\n\"We knew this was going to take a little bit of time. We played a tough schedule, lost a little confidence. We were trying to shape through all that, but it's mid-February and we're playing some good ball. As we have talked about, and will continue to talk about I don't think we are at our peak yet.\n\n\"I think we have areas that we can still improve, but we're headed in the right direction.\n\n\"I thought we did a great job on him. I thought he'd get some tough shows. The one I was disappointed with was the with three we gave up in the first half on the ball screen where our help wasn't high enough. We understand that for this team, Otega and Aberdeen are going to try and make all of the points.\n\n\"We got to do a good job of running Chandler off the line, which we didn't. But if we could cut their waiter off and that we would give ourselves a good chance to win. They're both really good players and you're not going to make them miss every time.\n\n\"But you know to go combined 12 of 35, that's winning basketball for sure.\"\n\n\"It means a lot because you're in position. It means first of all that you are playing well, and you're trying to win a league. But it doesn't change how we approach anything we do. We're not going to talk about holding onto first place leading up to the South Carolina game. It really has nothing to do with that.\n\n\"I do think, to talk about the Auburn game, that might have been a little bit of our issue that day. We were talking about getting back in position to win the league, look too far forward. This team has been at its best when we've living in the now, and focusing on getting better every day, and not worrying about anything other than the next game.\"\n\n\"Well, I think Kentucky has been rebounding the ball better. Tennessee got them on the glass but if you look at their last five or so matchups, they've been getting close to 30% of their misses back or more.\n\n\"They are playing much bigger than they were earlier. I think its kind of a result of that. Rebounding was a big part of the scout. It was a concern of ours to make sure we kept them off the glass. They got us early. They weren't making shots. They were getting their second chances.\n\n\"We weren't putting any pressure on the offensive glass. I think we were even at halftime on the glass, but I thought they won the boards. They won the battle of the boards in the first half, but we did a much better job. Our tenaciousness, our physicality, showed up in the last 10 minutes of the game.\n\n\"I thought we dominated that way. We kind of refused to not get the ball. That has to be our calling card as we move forward.\"\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida basketball postgame quotes from Todd golden after Kentucky win",

    "description": "What does Germaine Pratt's free agent contract projection look like and will the Indianapolis Colts re-sign him?",
    "fullText": "Indianapolis Colts linebacker Germaine Pratt is set to be a free agent this upcoming offseason.\n\nSo what might his next contract look like, and will the Colts re-sign him?\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Pratt is projected to land a one-year deal in free agency worth $2.874 million.\n\nIn terms of player age, contract status, and statistical production, Christian Rozeboom, EJ Speed, and Eric Wilson were used by Spotrac as comparisons to determine what Pratt's deal could be.\n\nThe addition of Pratt early on in the season helped provide some stability at linebacker for the Colts. Prior to signing Pratt, several different linebackers saw starting snaps next to Zaire Franklin.\n\nPratt finished his season with the Colts recording 101 total tackles and holding pass-catchers to 10.1 yards per reception. He also had one interception and three pass breakups.\n\nIf Pratt's contract is in the ballpark that Spotrac is projecting, we can't rule out his return to the Colts. It's a short-term deal that doesn't break the bank.\n\nHowever, GM Chris Ballard said that he wanted to get younger and faster on defense this offseason. Re-signing Pratt doesn't accomplish that.\n\nPrediction: Pratt is not re-signed.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts free agency: Will Germaine Pratt be re-signed?

    "fullText": "This past week, I asked a question that was originally suggested by Johnny, aka Alpha6:\n\nWith the idea that our Miami Dolphins have taken multiple members of both the front office and coaching staff away from the Green Bay Packers to rebuild the staff in Miami, do you see the Packers taking a step back, aka are they now weakened by subtraction, and/or will our own Dolphins take a step forward, aka strengthened by addition?\n\nI did not receive as many answers as I would have liked, but below are some of the thoughts and answers that we did get-\n\nTheRoo1 chimed in with some more ideas for us to base articles on. Always appreciated! Any ideas at any time can be sent to me via the comments section of my post or directly via my X/Twitter account.\n\nJames, since the Phins will be bargain basement shoppers this year in free agency, articles on matching needs to low budget fills,,,, pick a position group and go.\n\nhighlight miami rehab facility, association with Baptist health, can Phins develop a reputation as a preferred location for players rehabbing or returning from injury, Can we get some good one or two year rentals of returning players wanting to take advantage of Phin facilities and staff .\n\nA primer article on contract types, futures etc, effect on salary cap, cap dates, requirements, and ways to stretch the cap.\n\nfinfanfromsiam, in response to TheRoo1 wants no more broken-down players.\n\nPlease no more injured players with upside or potential….!\n\nCaliFins, in response to finfanfromsiam concurs on the broken-down player thing and does not want players signed just because they used to be great.\n\nThat was my biggest gripe. We are cap strapped, but we are going to bring in an injured Beckham and have him just collect a check for most of the season so we can sell jerseys with his name on them. Or hey, next season let’s do it again with Waller!! That $3Mill for Beckham was thrown away and McDaniel was so busy looking at his shinny new toy in Waller and thinking of all the great things he can open up for him, that he missed seeing Dulcich on his own practice squad until the end of the season.\n\nI’m glad this regime is seeing it. Built a tough next man up culture from within. Nurture players for years, don’t rent them for one or two.\n\nDolfanjoe hopes that we are not doing this all over again in 4-6 years.\n\nShould we put the Dolphin flag at (Half Staff ) ! Retaining some of the Miami staff and adding GBs to the top of the food chain ? What happens in 27 when we have the first pick in the draft ? Will they say plan has gone perfectly. Or will the Fan’s be clamoring for off with there heads ! Will GB be there with the second pick in the draft because they lost Coaches and couldn’t find anyone to take there place ? I have yet to see how long the contracts are for our head coach and GM. I would guess about 6 years. Hopefully by 4 they have earned them. I keep using the magic 8 ball i have found at the garage sale, of course while wearing my Ricky jersey i bought for ten bucks. And each time i ask if they made the right decision the answer keeps coming up Try Again ? Does that mean in 6 years try again or this thing is stuck ? Oh well i guess we have years to decide if all is well with the Universe……………………\n\ncoach k 13 likes the idea of adding staff from the GB Pakcker due to their past success.\n\nI could really care less what happens with Green bay! LOL!, but I like Miami getting coaches from the Packers, Let’s face it, they have been a solid team for many many years.\n\nfinfanfromsiam belives that Green Bay will hold onto their culture and just reload. Also hopes that it translates the same way for the Dolphins.\n\nI think the Packers will reload and be fine. They have their culture and way of doing things so will be ok. We can only hope that translates to be what we can build here. I think getting rid of the anchor of Grier/McDaniel is addition by subtraction. The new infusion of blood should propel us forward to hopefully reach in the same neighborhood of Green Bay. We will see how it pans out starting in March.\n\nSpok507 doesn’t know much about Packers guys, but seems encouraged that they are going to move on from Tua.\n\nI’ll admit I don’t know much about the new GM and HC and even less about the Packers. I can only hope they have a plan to bring this franchise back to prominence. I’ve waited a long time for them to move on from the mistake of drafting Tua, so I have to hope things will improve. I do believe they can rebuild as long as they focus on substance instead of flash now.\n\nWell thats it for our comments this evening. As always, thank you to each of you who took the time to answer our Phinsider Question Of The Day. I will return tomorrow evening with a new question of the day post.",

    "description": "Liverpool 3-0 Brighton: Salah scored and assisted to continue the healing process after his outburst late last year as the Reds stayed on course for FA Cup glory",
    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah patted the badge on his chest as the Kop chorused his song. It was a rare feat, even by his standards: just the third time in his Liverpool career he had scored, assisted and won a penalty in the same game.\n\nAs Salah was able to celebrate with his public again after scoring, his 252nd goal for Liverpool was only his second since his incendiary interview at Leeds. The process of reintegration began with a cameo against Brighton in December. It accelerated with a spot-kick against Albion in February.\n\nHe won it and scored it, tripped by Pascal Gross, rifling his shot into the roof of the net. He had only struck once in his previous 12 games for Liverpool, and that was against Qarabag. He had not found the net against a Premier League club since Aston Villa’s visit at the start of November. This meant a lot. “It was very big for the confidence,” said Salah. “It was very big, for sure.” It felt like another step in the healing process. “It is very nice to have him on the scoresheet again but what I like is that he is helping the team defensively,” said Arne Slot.\n\nWhatever the summer holds for him, Liverpool could enjoy the sight of Salah looking irrepressible. Perhaps, too, they could be grateful that what looked a crisis was defused. That may reflect well on Slot and if the Dutchman has had too few games this season when every decision he has made has brought a rich reward, this victory came with sweet vindication.\n\nAs the Liverpool manager fielded his latest line-up without a specialist right-back, the assumption might have been that Dominik Szoboszlai was in the back four and Curtis Jones in midfield. Instead, it was the other way around.\n\nEach was on the scoresheet, and in a way that reflected the role Slot had given him. Jones scored for the first time since 2024 by materialising at the far post. Szoboszlai used his running power to burst through the inside-right channel and unleash his second unstoppable shot in as many weeks at Anfield.\n\nIn the process, Slot may have learned a lesson from a game when his choices backfired. At the corresponding stage of the FA Cup a year ago, he selected too much of a weakened side and suffered the embarrassment of defeat to Plymouth. Twelve months on, he started with nine of his strongest available 11 and, while Hugo Ekitike and Ryan Gravenberch began on the bench, the Dutchman’s rest permitted Jones’s return and allowed Szoboszlai to play in midfield.\n\nThe context has changed from Slot’s first taste of the FA Cup, which ended so ignominiously in Devon. Now it is Liverpool’s most realistic chance of silverware this season, and they swept into the fifth round. Their league position remains unsatisfactory but they have only been beaten twice in 18 outings in all competitions and, after the frustration of last week’s loss to Manchester City, they have conjured a response by beating Sunderland and Brighton.\n\nTheir season has been a story of makeshift right-backs and, for all the issues injuries have posed, they have added some productivity. Szoboszlai has twin spectacular free kicks against Arsenal and City when deployed as a defender. Jones ended a lengthy drought when – in theory, anyway – stationed further from the Brighton goal. “There have been times I’ve scored more but not played as well as I am now,” he said after getting a first goal in 58 games.\n\nThe Liverpudlian had come agonisingly close with a left-footed shot from 20 yards. Then, meeting Milos Kerkez’s inviting cross on the half-volley, he crashed in a shot off the underside of the bar. “It was very pleasing the first goal was an assist from the left-back to the right-back,” Slot said.\n\nKerkez ended up being overshadowed – not least by his fellow Hungairan – but he was terrific. He married deft skill with dynamic runs. He had drawn a fine save from Jason Steele with a rising, rasping half-volley. Then came his assist.\n\n“The second goal was even nicer than the first one,” Slot said. Salah cushioned a pass into the path of the surging Szoboszlai and, without breaking stride, he drove a shot past Steele. “He is one of the best players in the world right now,” said Salah. Szoboszlai earned a fourth assist for the Egyptian since his return from the African Cup of Nations.\n\nWhen the 33-year-old then scored himself from the penalty spot, it was cue for Slot to substitute him, to a rousing ovation. His replacement Rio Ngumoha had a goal ruled out for offside; there was no VAR to prove he was onside. Meanwhile, Brighton objected to Salah’s spot kick. “Poor decision,” said Fabian Hurzeler. “Never a penalty.”\n\nHe could also lament moments either side of the interval. “We had enough chances to score a goal,” added Hurzeler. But Alisson saved from Diego Gomez, coming to Jones’s rescue after he slipped. He clawed away Lewis Dunk’s header. After his error against City, it was a redemptive return to Anfield for Alisson, and justification for Slot in selecting him, rather than Giorgi Mamardashvili.\n\nSo there was no seismic double for Brighton, conquerors of Manchester United at Old Trafford in the third round, no cup run deflect from underachievement in the Premier League.\n\n“We are not in a good moment,” Hurzeler said. But now Salah is.",

    "description": "After a strong win against Brighton to advance in the FA Cup, we take a look at what it all means for Arne Slot’s Reds.",
    "fullText": "Don’t say it too loud, but Liverpool are starting to become fun to watch again. It’s still not the most convincing Liverpool side, and there are plenty of worries about the effectiveness of the formation and some of the seemingly nailed on starters. Still, there was more emphasis on the attack in a fairly open match with Brighton that saw Liverpool deservedly take a 1-0 lead just ahead of halftime before blowing the game open in the second half as the Reds now advance to the quarterfinals of the FA Cup.\n\nBelow, we take a look at some winners and losers on the night, and attempt to disentangle narrative from fact.\n\nThe Hungarian left back has quite possibly his best performance for Liverpool to date. He was very solid with his positioning and 1v1 defending throughout the match, and showed great aggressiveness getting forward into the attack. He set up the first goal by running down a loose ball before it could go out of play and then sending in a perfect cross that was tapped home by Curtis Jones. Kerkez also forced a brilliant save with a rocket from distance after making himself available for a free kick sent over the top with a heads up early run down the left wing.\n\nThe Scouser got a rare start since the start of the new year, becoming the latest victim…er player…to slide into the seemingly cursed right back role. Curtis did what he needed to do defensively and was calm withstanding the press out of the back. He scored the opening goal with an instinctive finish from a midfielder’s late run, tapping in from close range after a sumptuous cross by Milos Kerkez. Jones shifted into midfield midway through the second half, and continued to be a strong presence. He finished with an almost 90% pass completion rate.\n\nSzobo returned from his one match suspension, and was somewhat surprisingly unshackled into the midfield. The high press was immediately better than we have seen recently with his presence in the midfield. The Hungarian put in a peach of a set piece that was headed into the net by Cody Gakpo, but the attacker was offside. Szoboszlai made no mistake with his own opportunity as he steamed forward from midfield to get on the end of a perfect layoff by Mohamed Salah before slamming the ball past the goalkeeper from the top of the box. Szoboszlai finished with an almost perfect 47 for 48 passing.\n\nThere were still plenty of worrying signs about the decline of Salah throughout the match, but he came up big in a couple of key moments to blow the match wide open. His cushioned first-time pass off of a crossfield ball from Cody Gakpo was perfectly weighted for the run of Szoboszlai that was finished off for the second goal of the match. Mo found a little bit of his old magic later in the second half, facing up a defender and just straight running through him on the dribble before forcing a clear foul in the box that was actually awarded as a penalty kick. Mo drilled the spot kick into the top corner to finish the match with a goal and an assist.\n\nAli had two huge interventions to preserve the lead when Liverpool were only up a goal. He made a fantastic 1v1 save after Curtis Jones slipped, allowing Diego Gomez through on goal. Alisson also made a perfectly timed punch on a header that was put back across the face of goal just ahead of several Brighton players could get a touch. In total, Alisson finished with 3 saves and a couple heart-in-mouth moments with the ball at his feet. All in a day’s work.\n\nCody continues to be a ever present frustrating presence up top for the Reds. He did end up with a hockey assist for the second goal from a good crossfield ball for Mohamed Salah, but Gakpo’s only other real contributions was getting fouled. He was again offside in crucial situations where he really should have been able to get onside. He also was saved blushes after blocking a goalbound shot by Milos Kerkez after the flag went up for offside.\n\nGiven a rare opportunity to start Chiesa failed to have any real impact on the match. His effervescent energy and boundless running seems a lot more effective when he comes on as a sub. He finished with just 14 touches during his 76 minutes, with one shot.\n\nWith a midweek match, there were many who thought Arne Slot may rotate a decent number of players for the cup match to rest some weary legs. In the end, only Ryan Gravenberch and Hugo Ekitike of the regular starters were rotated out, giving opportunities to Curtis Jones and Federico Chiesa. It would appear that Slot feels the need to put forth a strong effort in the FA Cup competition after a disastrous fall and winter have put him on thin ice with most supporters. While there will rightfully be concerns about tired legs for the likes of Florian Wirtz, Alexis Mac Allister, and Virgil van Dijk, the ability to start and build some positive momentum may just have been worth it with a week of rest before the next match.\n\nLiverpool will return to Premier League play next Sunday as they travel to face struggling Nottingham Forest. The hosts will be playing their first league match under new manager Vitor Pereira after Sean Dyche was sacked.

    "description": "Michigan Hockey looked the part of a National Championship contender with a convincing 6-3 win over the Penn State Nittany Lions:",
    "fullText": "There may have been nine combined goals, but it was a different recipe than usual as No. 2 Michigan Hockey secured a home sweep of No. 6 Penn State on Saturday night with a 6-3 victory.\n\nThe Wolverines (24-5-1, 14-4-1 Big Ten, 43 points) delivered one of their better defensive efforts of the season as freshman goaltender Jack Ivankovic looked like himself, making 30 saves and a handful of spectacular ones, including a lunging, glove stop to preserve a then 3-1 lead.\n\nAn empty-netter by junior forward Nick Moldenhauer made it 6-3 with 61 seconds left, and had it not been for a late Nittany Lions (18-9-1, 10-7-1 Big Ten, 33 points) two-goal push, the final score would have been more reflective of Michigan’s dominance.\n\nThe Wolverines did an excellent job of limiting high-danger chances and forcing Penn State into perimeter shots that Ivankovic made look easy.\n\nSeven-and-a-half minutes into the first, freshman forward Cole McKinney broke the ice. He won an offensive zone draw, did well to position himself in front of the crease and redirected a point shot-pass from senior defenseman Luca Fantilli. McKinney continues to make high-IQ plays, is a real face off weapon and looks far beyond his years.\n\nAlmost four minutes later, Moldenhauer got his first after junior defenseman Ben Robertson — who usually stands out for his responsible defensive game — made a nifty move on the right wing, drove into the slot and momentarily lost the puck. But Moldenhauer was there to tuck home Michigan’s second goal, making it 2-0.\n\nPenn State did answer, as it won a battle in the corner, and a drop pass led to forward Reese Laubach wristing a shot past Ivankovic. However, that was about all the Wolverines would allow, as the top pair of Fantilli and senior Tyler Duke shut down this high-octane attack. Meanwhile, Robertson and freshman Drew Schock helped hold down the fort, and sophomore Dakoda Rhéaume-Mullen and freshman Asher Barnett provide this unit with even more depth, smooth skating and jam.\n\nJunior forward Jayden Perron provided a crucial, tic-tac-toe power play insurance goal to make it 3-1 in the second. It started with senior forward T.J. Hughes, who had two assists, walking down the slot and hitting freshman forward Malcolm Spence on the post, who proceeded to find Perron in the low slot.\n\nUnlike Friday night’s up-and-down shootout, this was a far more encouraging performance from Michigan. Those defensemen and help from the forwards continued to stymie Penn State, which grew desperate to cut the deficit.\n\nInstead, it was sophomore Will Horcoff ending his four-game goal drought, as his right circle shot hit a skate and took a fortuitous bounce into the net. He has been in a bit of a slump lately and the hope is that lucky score reverses his fortunes.\n\nSophomore forward Michael Hage earned a secondary assist on Horcoff’s goal, too, bringing his total to two and furthering his outstanding offensive output.\n\nShortly thereafter, freshman forward Adam Valentini was the recipient of Spence poking the puck free off a faceoff and he was left alone for the Wolverines’ fifth goal.\n\nThe Nittany Lions did show life down the stretch, as Laubach scored on a power play and forward Luka Misa redirected a Gavin McKenna shot. Yet, it was too little too late, and after Moldenhauer’s empty netter, the Children of Yost were finally treated to some post-whistle scrums, which resulted in a bevy of penalties.\n\nNow, Michigan gets to celebrate its weekend before heading to Madison for a couple of dates with the Badgers.",

    "title": "On TikTok, we're all Chinese – but the trend doesn't paint the full picture",
    "description": "Chinamaxxing is adding more gloss to the recent flourish of Chinese soft power.",
    "fullText": "Or at least that's what they claim on TikTok, where a trend called \"Chinamaxxing\" has taken off in the West.\n\nChinese wellness practices, once associated with the tacky and geriatric, have suddenly found themselves in vogue, largely among Americans.\n\nFrom warm apple-boiled water to indoor slippers and longevity exercises, people are sharing videos of themselves \"learning to be Chinese\". Many come with the Fight Club-inspired caption \"you met me at a very Chinese time in my life\", or the hashtag #newlychinese.\n\nAs Donald Trump shakes up the world order, the Chinese Communist Party has welcomed this boost to the country's image.\n\nChinamaxxing is certainly adding more gloss to the recent flourish of Chinese soft power. Over the past year we've seen the world clamour for Labubu dolls, wait in line at brand new stores to buy Mixue bubble tea and Luckin coffee, and scroll through their friends' holiday feeds in the \"cyberpunk city\" of Chongqing.\n\nSome say Chinamaxxing stems from young Americans' disenchantment with their own country, although it's unclear how much that is really driving the trend.\n\nBut like so many internet trends, this one hardly paints the full picture. It's a celebration of memes and fleeting moments that make up just one slice of Chinese life. Beyond that are young people who, like their American counterparts, are also worried about their future in a sluggish economy and a fast-changing world.\n\nSome Chinese youth may find it strange that parts of their culture - long seen as \"uncool\" in the Western imagination - are now the object of fascination. Some may find it offensive that Westerners on TikTok are facetiously claiming they've been \"diagnosed as Chinese\".\n\nBut others say Chinamaxxing strikes a different note from derogatory jokes like \"bing chilling\" - where the punchline is ex-wrestler John Cena's stilted Mandarin pronunciation - or the \"social credit\" meme that mocks the Chinese government's restrictions on personal freedoms.\n\nThis time, Chinese people are in on the joke - not the butt of it.\n\nOne of the most influential figures behind the Chinamaxxing meme is Sherry Zhu, a Chinese-American TikTok content creator who regularly shares traditional wellness tips with her \"Chinese baddies\".\n\n\"Tomorrow you're turning Chinese,\" she tells her 740,000 TikTok followers. \"And I know that sounds intimidating, but there is no point in fighting it now.\"\n\nFew could have seen this coming.\n\nIt was not that long ago when the Covid pandemic sparked a wave of Sinophobia. Chinese diaspora spoke of racism and how people were avoiding the community and their businesses.\n\nThen a stunned world watched Beijing put its cities into hellish lockdowns. Reports emerged of residents running out of food and pleading for help from inside their sealed-off neighbourhoods. The restrictions ended only in early 2023 after rare protests. By then expats had left China in droves, many of them saying too much had changed.\n\nThere was also an exodus from Hong Kong, where Beijing's control was reshaping the city. This, along with China's growing power and assertiveness, strained the relationship with the West, even as the world's reliance on the Chinese economy became clear.\n\nMeanwhile, China's investments in tech, infrastructure and exports began to pay off - and became more visible as it reopened post pandemic, relaxing visa rules to bring back tourists.\n\nIt was hard to miss: glitzy skyscrapers, a sprawling high-speed rail network, highways packed with electric vehicles, and a boom in green energy, robotics and artificial intelligence. Chongqing - a humid southwestern metropolis which once made global headlines for a corruption scandal and murder - turned popular and cool.\n\nThere have been other, smaller triumphs. Young people around the world are snatching Adidas Tang-style jackets off the shelves, bingeing on Chinese micro-dramas and experimenting with powdery make-up looks flaunted by Chinese girls and women on Douyin, China's version of TikTok.\n\n\"As a Chinese person who has been online throughout years and years of heavy Sinophobia, it felt refreshing to have the mainstream opinion finally shift regarding China,\" Claire, a Chinese-Canadian TikTok user, tells BBC Chinese.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who shares political content on TikTok and would only reveal her first name for that reason, says, for her, the \"critical juncture\" was last year.\n\nThat was when she noticed a shift in attitudes about China. A wave of Americans arrived on RedNote, a popular Chinese social media app, ahead of a TikTok ban in the US.\n\nWithin days memes became the currency of these American \"TikTok refugees\" as two worlds that rarely interact because of China's internet firewall were brought closer.\n\n\"These young people have watched their physical reality remain frozen while China built entire cities,\" says Afra Wang, a tech writer and podcaster.\n\n\"When you can't build high-speed rail but you can scroll through videos of Chinese infrastructure, of course the future starts to look Chinese.\"\n\nFor observers like her, it's no coincidence that Chinamaxxing comes as the American Dream seems to be dimming.\n\nAmericans who came of age after the Iraq War, the 2008 global financial crisis or even the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot face a job market disrupted by globalisation and then AI, Wang says: \"American exceptionalism was never something they lived.\"\n\nWhat do people in China think of Chinamaxxing? Not much, it seems. The trend has stirred limited reactions on Chinese social media.\n\nRather, in the eyes of Chinese people, America, once seen as a beacon of success, has lost its shimmer. Not least because tensions between the two sides have made it harder for Chinese students who want to study or work there.\n\n\"During America's Chinamaxxing moment, China is experiencing its own America-minimising moment,\" Wang says.\n\nOn parts of Chinese social media, there are dystopian references to the \"US kill line\", a Chinese gaming term that refers to the perilous descent into poverty in the US. The idea, which took root quickly among users and influencers, is that America is a tough place to survive because a single stroke of bad luck can derail your life.\n\nThe term's popularity on social media is helped by the fact that it has been embraced by Chinese state media and the government. They have sought to portray the US as a decaying superpower because of inequality, a weak social safety net and a broken healthcare system.\n\nAccording to a commentary in state-owned Xinhua, the \"kill line\" meme \"underscores how far the lived reality can drift from the ideals once broadcast to the world\".\n\nIt's little wonder that Chinese authorities are pleased with Chinamaxxing.\n\n\"Chinese lifestyles increasingly gain global appeal, offer a steadier way of being,\" reads the headline of a Global Times piece about the trend.\n\nWhen asked about it at a press briefing earlier this month, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said a \"unique blend of history and modernity\" is making China increasingly appealing to foreigners.\n\nHe was \"happy\" to see foreigners experiencing the \"everyday life of ordinary Chinese people\".\n\nFor one, it's hard to know what Chinese people make of so many things because all public conversation and activity is heavily policed. Criticising the government is risky and protests are quickly quashed.\n\nTwo, there is a lot the memes making it to the West don't show. China's youth are facing an unemployment rate that sits at more than 15% and burning out from a gruelling work culture, yet sharing too much of their pessimism online could alert internet censors. They are worried about finding a home as the country's property crisis continues, and dating is no easier than anywhere else.\n\nPropping up breakneck delivery speeds are gig workers scrambling to hit deadlines. Many can relate to the hustle: in 2023, Beijing courier Hu Anyan's memoir about the relentless nature of gig work became a national bestseller.\n\n\"When I think of my American friends and tech people wandering through Shenzhen in awe, I also think of my own experience in Shenzhen,\" Wang says. \"Drinking a six yuan latte from Luckin Coffee, delivered on a scooter by someone like Hu Anyan, whose labour makes 'cool China' visible while remaining almost invisible themselves.\"\n\nPerhaps, if the fascination with China's successes continues, more of Chinese life will surface. But for now apple tea seems to be where it's at.\n\n\"Ever since I started boiling apples in my tea water my period cramps have completely gone,\" reads a comment on RedNote from an American user - one of the TikTok refugees still lingering on the app.\n\n\"We have so much still left to learn being Chinese.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Eunice Yang from BBC Chinese",

    "title": "I Have Nothing but Red Herring to Hide",
    "description": "The I-have-nothing-to-hide argument is a red herring; the real privacy argument is about who gets to choose what to share.",
    "fullText": "The term red herring is a figure of speech that we use to refer to an argument or plot device that creates a distraction from the real issue.\n\nHerrings aren't naturally red, but when are cured or smoked for consumption, they can take on a reddish colour. Smoked or cured herring is also very pungent, and this is allegedly the reason why we use the term today. An early 19th Century English political journalist referred to incorrect news reporting being like a red herring drawn across the escape route of a hare, in order to throw the hunting dogs off the trail.1\n\nAs a plot device, red herrings are common in stories and films. For example, in the original Star Wars trilogy, we are led to believe that there is potential for romance between Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, but that is a total red herring, as we find out later on.\n\nIn arguments, the term red herring is used to flag arguments that sound relevant to the discussion but are in fact not. A bad argument like that is called a logical fallacy, meaning it doesn't make any sense if you think about it carefully. A red herring is a logical fallacy that takes us off the trail leading towards the truth.\n\nIt's important to understand that the use of red herrings can be completely unintentional.\n\nDeductive reasoning means that if statements leading up to the conclusion are all true then the conclusion has to be true too. It can be worthwhile to write out arguments in this way.\n\nFor example, we can argue that humans are animals like this:\n\nwhere the symbol ∴ means therefore.\n\nHere is famous example of deductive reasoning about our mortality:\n\nLet's look at one more example:\n\nThis is a statement that sounds plausible, but it's a claim that can't be made, because we cannot read minds. The first premise says \"Freedom is important to all humans\", but, to be honest, I don't know if that is really true.\n\nEven though the conclusion rings true, there's a problem with one of the premises leading to the conclusion, makes the whole argument not sound.\n\nIn discussions about mass data collection and digital surveillance, people often respond with \"but I have nothing to hide...,\" as a way of saying that mass surveillance is acceptable to them.\n\nPro-privacy advocates are constantly breaking their heads on how to respond to this. The New Oil recently published a good blog post addressing some of the issues with saying that you have nothing to hide.\n\nHowever, here I want to show that the I-have-nothing-to-hide argument is a red herring. It's a statement that is related to the general topic of surveillance, but not necessarily relevant to to arguments about digital privacy.\n\nOften when you tell someone that we should worry about Big Tech companies or governments scanning and recording private data about us, people shrug and say \"I have nothing to hide,\" implying they are not worried about large scale surveillance.\n\nHere's the argument written out:\n\nWhen I presented these to my philosopher friend M., he showed me this argument:\n\nThis is a sound argument. The first statement is a conditional statement. \"When it rains\" is the condition, and the second half of that sentences, \"the streets get wet,\" is the result we see if that condition is met.\n\nIn logic, it is acceptable to either affirm the condition (i.e., \"It is raining\") or deny the result of the condition (i.e., \"The streets are not wet).\n\nHowever, it is not OK to do the opposite, namely deny the condition (\"It is not raining\") or affirm the result (\"the streets are wet\"), as then you'll get strange arguments like this:\n\nThis is a flawed conclusion, because other factors, like a broken fire hydrant, can also make the streets wet. Similarly, there is this:\n\nwhich shows another version of the same blind spot,, namely that other factors can make streets wet.\n\nIf we now go revisit the I-have-nothing-to-hide argument, we can see that the same thing is happening as in the bad rain arguments:\n\nThe second premise \"I have nothing to hide\" denies the condition \"If you have something to hide\".\n\nThe flaw here is that that you are not necessarily off the hook just because you have nothing to hide. There could be other reasons why digital mass surveillance might affect you negatively\n\nSo that takes care of the argument \"I have nothing to hide.\" Saying \"I have nothing to hide\" as a response to concerns about digital surveillance only addresses one way that digital can negatively affect people. Even if you really had nothing to hide, surveillance can still have a negative affect on you in other ways. Your fully transparent life doesn't immunise you from the many other bad things that come with surveillance, such as, for example, your statements or photos made 20 years ago being used against you in a current, different political climate.\n\nSo thank you, M., for your helpful insights!\n\nHowever, we are not done yet, because I started this blog by saying that the \"I have nothing to hide\" response is a red herring, meaning it has little to do with what the argument is really about. So in the final section, I'd like to show the true digital privacy argument.\n\nThis doesn't ignore that governments may need to use their power take private information from you, for example, when you are a suspected of a crime. In good governance there should be deterrents in place, such as warrants, to avoid governments abusing their power.\n\nGovernmental power and individual privacy is tricky. It gets tricker when governments use corporate surveillance tools, as has been extensively covered by 404Media in their recent reporting of Flock's license plate reader cameras.\n\nHowever, when it comes to corporate surveillance by Google, Meta, Amazon and others, it is clear that whether you have something to hide or not has little to do with who should get to decide about sharing (or taking) that private information.\n\nYou do. Even if you don't have anything to hide.\n\n3 Reasons Why Everyone Has Something to Hide\n\n404Media's reporting on Flock cameras\n\nIn picking apart these arguments, I got stuck and confused several times, but this article, and this sentence in particular, helped me stay on the right track:\n\nThe valid forms can be summarized as affirming the antecedent, or denying the consequent. The invalid forms are called traditionally \"denying the an-tecedent\" and \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nThere is a detailed and interesting discussion contesting the relationship between herring and hunting on the Wikipedia page about the term red herring.↩",

    "description": "A mom reflects on why going from one child to two was far harder than expected, and how chaos reshaped her parenting standards.",
    "fullText": "When I was a mom of one, I nailed motherhood. I was calm and patient; my child was well-dressed; the car was pristine; the chores were completed; and there was very little shouting. But as a mom of two, I just can't parent to the same standards. Everything is messier, louder, more rushed, less organized, and good enough, just has to be enough.\n\nGoing from one child to two has, without a doubt, been one of, if not the hardest, adjustments of my entire life. One plus one does not equal two in this scenario. As a mom to a 1.5-year-old, a 3.5-year-old, a 16-year-old stepson, and two needy cats, it sometimes feels like I care for a dozen creatures.\n\nWhen I was pregnant with my second, I wasn't naive. I didn't think two would be easy. From the moment I brought my second home from the hospital, and he met my first with a cry that brought my first to tears as well, it has been a pinball game of crying, clinging, grabbing, and fighting.\n\nEach child seemingly has a different, urgent need that requires individual attention and the patience of someone who has had a full night's sleep. They both want \"mommy!\" all the time, especially when the other wants me.\n\nMost days, I'll be lucky to have a sip of water and finger brush my hair into a ponytail before the madness ensues. Once spotted, I'm bum-rushed as they joust for a prime spot on my lap or in my arms. Even with one on each leg with my legs spread as wide as they possibly can, they are still fighting over me, while likely trying to bat each other away. At 40 and 30 pounds each, holding both for more than a moment is back-breaking.\n\nCountless times since becoming a parent of two, I've wondered why I'm not better at this. I've always excelled at what I put my energy toward, but this has absolutely shattered me. Most of the time, I'm able to rescue myself from the rabbit hole of feeling like a failure by reminding myself that it feels hard because it IS hard.\n\nAdding a child when you already have one changes every dynamic in your life, including your relationship with your first child, and adds a whole new dynamic: your children's relationship with each other.\n\nCorners are cut, patience and sleep are limited, and the breaks you used to have when your partner had the other child no longer exist. Oh, did I forget to mention my partner? There's hardly any time for him. That relationship, the one that is most important in keeping everything afloat, is tested to the absolute limits.\n\nAs I write this, both kids are at day care. It's my one day a week without them (if they haven't contracted the latest day care bug), and I'm surrounded by chaos.\n\nThere's a tent in front of me and a play mop on top of what was once our living room table, now a receptacle for apple cores, half-eaten bananas, board books, sippy cups, tissues (some used), and a rotating selection of kitchen utensils.\n\nAmid all the clutter, I see the literal and figurative crumb trails my boys have left: crackers and playdough ground into the carpet, a red fire engine toy on the armchair of the sofa, a wooden spoon deposited in boots as one exited the front door that morning.\n\nDespite the messy, loud, hectic life I now have, I can't wait to pick them up from day care, even though I know it will be pandemonium from the moment they see me.",

While appearing in the files does not mean a person is associated with Epstein's crimes, some have nonetheless faced a public fallout by association.\n\nIn Wasserman's case, the documents revealed that the entertainment mogul flew on Epstein's jet with several people, including former US President Bill Clinton. He also exchanged emails with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking girls for Epstein. Wasserman's emails with Maxwell were dated 2003, long before police began to investigate Epstein and over a decade before police arrested Maxwell.\n\nWasserman issued an apology following the revelations, but a backlash from his roster of top talent had already begun. Singer Chappell Roan, Olympian Abby Wambach, and others said they intended to leave his agency over his association with Epstein.\n\n\"It was years before their criminal conduct came to light, and, in its entirety, consisted of one humanitarian trip to Africa and a handful of emails that I deeply regret sending,\" Wasserman wrote in the memo to staff on Friday. \"And I'm heartbroken that my brief contact with them 23 years ago has caused you, this company, and its clients so much hardship over the past days and weeks.\"\n\nRead the full memo Wasserman sent to his employees:",

    "title": "An open-source real-time motor driver for the Lego Orrery",
    "description": "A real-time motor driver mod kit for the LEGO 42179 Earth & Moon Orrery",
    "fullText": "I recently got my hands on the Lego Orrery set, which despite being an educational interactive toy is an impressively accurate functional model that simulates the orbital movements of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nIt features a manual crank that runs a gear system that simulates three motions simultaneously: the Earth orbiting the Sun, the Moon orbiting the Earth, and the Earth rotating on its tilted axis. While turning the crank manually is a fun way to visualize the seasons, and the moon's phases. I hated seeing the model sit idle on my shelf after I was done playing with it. So I began to wonder: is this model precise enough to be driven by a motor for real-time celestial tracking? As it turns out, it absolutely is!\n\nThe mod I've made consists of a custom PCB that can be directly mounted to the back of a NEMA17 stepper motor an can be attached to the LEGO set replacing the manual crank by only removing 5 LEGO pieces. I'm using esp32 as the brains and a tmc2208 stepper motor driver to silently drive the motor, there's a knob which can be used to go back or forward in time to see upcoming lunar phases, and a button that resets the model to the current local time. When left idle the Orrery Driver runs the motor to match the real time with an impressive rotation of \n\n 0.225∘\n\n every 2.7 minutes!\n\nAs always this project is fully open-source and I'm also planning to offer it as a plug & play electronics kit on Tindie as I have some PCB's and components left over from the project. Let me know if you're interested in the comments!\n\n📝NOTE\n\nYou can find the ready to print CAD files, PCB Gerbers and Arduino code along with the components list in the project repo.\n\nThe hardware consists of a ESP32-c3 super mini for it's small scale factor, a center detent potentiometer, a tactile button, RTC module and a tmc2208 silentstick stepper driver, and a nema 17 motor.\n\nSince the LEGO Orrery is already quite compact, there was no room to hide a protoboard. To keep the footprint as small as possible, I designed a custom PCB that mounts directly onto the motor.\n\nI've used JST-EH connectors on the pcb to make assembly easier, a dedicated power supply of 5V 2A is needed as the motor is power hungry when it accelerates. All the components are through hole so you can easliy solder them on your own with a basic soldering iron. Just make sure you clean any flux residue after soldering as the contacts are really close and can cause a short if not careful.\n\n📝NOTE\n\nI didn't use sketches/drawings for the freeform brass structure, I ended up with this just with trial&error. So in these instructions I'll tell you how I managed to solder the structure. But I can't provide dimensions, etc. since I also don't know them.\n\nThe 4 digit 7 segment display can be mounted directly with a regular JST cable connector, but I went for a freeform look just for the aesthetics. I've used 0.8mm brass wire and a small set of pliers to bend them into shape.\n\nNow we get to the fun stuff! How do we drive the motor so that it can match real-time? Through testing, I discovered that one full rotation of the crank rotates the Earth three times on its axis. This 1:3 ratio is the key to calculating the exact speed our stepper motor needs to maintain. But before we do that we need to know how many steps the motor takes to complete a single revolution (\n\n S\n\n ). To calculate this we use the following formula:\n\nWhere \n\n θstep\n\n is the step angle of the motor and \n\n MS\n\n is Microstepping if you have it enabled. This will give us the steps per revolution (\n\n S\n\n ).\n\nIn my case the motor has \n\n 0.9∘\n\n step angle, and the stepper motor driver I'm using comes with \n\n 14\n\n Microstepping as default, which gives me \n\n S=1600\n\n steps per revolution!\n\nNow going back to the initial calculation of the \n\n 1:3\n\n ratio, we convert the total time of 3 days into \n\n 4,320\n\n minutes and divide that by our \n\n 1,600\n\n steps. This gives us exactly \n\n 2.7\n\n minutes per step. Which means that, the motor only needs to trigger one step every \n\n 2.7\n\n minutes to keep the model in sync with Earth's rotation!\n\nDownload the code from the repository and upload it to your ESP32 board via USB using the Arduino IDE, if this is the first time you are uploading code to your ESP32-C3 you might have to put the board in to download mode by holding the boot and reset buttons at the same time and then releasing the reset button after a few seconds.\n\nThe display will prompt you to calibrate the orrery when you first plug it in, use the knob to move the orrery in to the winter solstace position as shown in the LEGO manual:\n\nSimply press the button after you align the orrery and the orrery will start moving into it's real-time position!\n\n📝NOTE\n\nYou only have to calibrate the motor once when you plug it in first so it knows where the gears are, once set there's the RTC module alon with the EEPROM of the ESP32 is used to save the state of the motor to keep track of time in case of a power loss. So you only have to calibrate it once!\n\nAnd with that the build is finished! This project was really fun to build, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!\n\nNext:\n Shine-through Halloween PCB Pins",

    "description": "The seven Western states that depend on the Colorado River have missed a deadline for the second time to agree on a plan addressing record drought and water shortages.",
    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — The seven Western states that depend on the Colorado River missed a deadline for the second time Saturday to agree on a plan addressing record drought and water shortages.\n\nArizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo released a joint statement calling on Upper Basin states to offer more concessions. Those states include Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.\n\n“The Colorado River is essential to our communities and economies, and our states have conserved large volumes of water in recent years to stabilize the basin’s water supplies for years to come,” the governors said. “Our stance remains firm and fair: all seven basin states must share in the responsibility of conservation.”\n\nArizona, California and Nevada have offered to decrease Colorado River allocation by 27%, 10% and 17%, respectively, according to those states.\n\nColorado Sen. John Hickenlooper. who helped negotiate a river contingency plan in 2019 as governor, called the situation in the Colorado Basin “dire,” pointing to the state’s low snowpack.\n\n“If we don’t address this problem together –- head-on and fast –- our communities, farms, and economies will suffer. The best path forward is the one we take together. Litigation won’t solve the problem of this long-term aridification,” Hickenlooper said in a statement.\n\nJohn Entsminger, the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, also expressed frustration at the lack of progress.\n\n“The actions we have taken over the past two-plus decades are less about raising Lake Mead’s elevation than they are about protecting ourselves if things go from bad to worse,” Entsminger said in a statement.\n\nThe states previously let pass a November deadline set by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to devise a strategy to face water shortages after this year, when current guidelines will expire.\n\nOver 40 million people across these states along with Mexico and Native American tribes rely on Colorado River water. The river is crucial to farming as well as water and electricity for millions of homes and businesses. Much of the water starts out as winter mountain snowfall in the Upper Basin, which amasses far more that way than it consumes. Lower Basin states, including agriculture-heavy regions, are bigger consumers.\n\nMajor cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, are also big water consumers. Chronic overuse, drought and rising temperatures linked to climate change have lessened water flows.\n\nHow the water is allocated — especially in dry spells — and conserved has been the center of agreements among the states for decades. The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on water amounts that doesn’t exist today, especially with the long-term drought.\n\nThe current round of negotiations among states have been going on over two years.\n\nIf no consensus can be reached, the federal government could step in and devise a plan that leaves parties dissatisfied and could even result in litigation.\n\nScientists recently found snow cover and snow depth in the West are at their lowest in decades. Some areas have seen their warmest December through early February. Normally, snow cover this time of year spans 460,000 square miles — about the size of California, Utah, Idaho and Montana. But, this year it is only California-sized, about 155,000 square miles, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",

    "fullText": "The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.\n\nWe'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.\n\nInterviews will drop on weekends across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 00:15 GMT on Sunday, 15 February (and after Sportscene in Scotland).\n\nWhen Roberto Martinez first joined Wigan in 1995, he probably did not even dream that nearly 20 years later he would manage them to FA Cup victory.\n\nBut that is exactly how it panned out for the Spaniard, who masterminded their 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the 2013 final.\n\nThe Latics were also relegated from the Premier League that season, and within weeks of their Wembley success Martinez had joined Everton.\n\nThree years later he was sacked - and his two jobs since have been at international level - first with Belgium, and now Portugal.\n\nMartinez, 52, has been in his current role since January 2023, guiding Portugal to their second Nations League title when they beat Spain last year.\n\nLess than a month after that match, Portugal mourned the death of forward Diogo Jota, who died along with his brother Andre Silva in a car crash in northern Spain. Martinez said the team \"want to honour his memory every day\".\n\nIn this extended interview with Kelly Somers, Martinez spoke about a range of things, including winning the FA Cup, Belgium's 'golden generation' and why he has never drunk alcohol.\n\nKelly Somers: Let's start with football. Why football?\n\nRoberto Martinez: For me, it's a way of living. I was born in a family that was breathing football. My dad was mad about football. My dad was a coach at that time - a local team. I would be the mascot and I've got pictures where probably at the age of two and three, I would be listening to the team talks, and I would be in that environment of the dressing room. So that, for me, was a safe zone. I thought that all the kids did that. I thought that was the normal thing to do. And then I realised that it was the opposite. Not many kids had the opportunity to be in a team talk of the local team!\n\nKelly: Was that local team the first proper team you played for?\n\nRoberto: Yes - under-nines. In school in Spain, you play futsal. As a young student, you play with your futsal team in school on Friday and then on Saturday you play with a football team.\n\nKelly: Was there a point where you thought, 'OK, I could make this'... when you were looking around maybe at the other other kids and thought, 'oh, I'm at a good level here'?\n\nRoberto: At 16, if you want to play football, you have to go to a more professional standard. I got the opportunity to go to Zaragoza - move to the big city, study there - and then you see your parents coming to watch the game at the weekend... almost a ritual.\n\nKelly: When you look back on your career, which club do you feel was where you had your most success? Or you enjoyed the most?\n\nRoberto: I enjoyed them all. They were all different, they were all challenging. I think in 1995 when the Bosman ruling came out [enabling football players to leave clubs at the end of their contracts for free], we were the first three Spaniards to come to the UK.\n\nKelly: The 'Three Amigos', weren't you?\n\nRoberto: The 'Three Amigos', yes! I think as a human being, we're always fearful... we don't like change. I was always the opposite. My answer would be: 'Why not?' So... 'Would you like to go to the UK without speaking a word of English and play football?' My answer was: 'Why not?'\n\nKelly: So you couldn't speak any English when you came over?\n\nRoberto: No, no. We arrived the first day at Wigan and I remember the press officer saying: 'Would you mind to do a little bit... a couple of words with the local media?' I said: 'I would love to, but I don't speak a word of English!' And those are the challenges that they really... they make you as a person.\n\nKelly: Let's talk just quickly about that FA Cup final, because that's still one of the greatest shocks... one of the greatest FA Cup finals in history. How do you reflect upon that all these years later?\n\nRoberto: With a lot of pride. Dreams can really happen in the FA Cup. And I think that game... you play the champions of England - Man City - with all the stars. The odds are against the underdog. I think everybody likes it. I always found out that we had so many neutral fans that day... that's what happens in the FA Cup. But to actually perform and deserve to win was very special.\n\nKelly: At what point did you think, 'management is for me'? Was it always management?\n\nRoberto: Always. Always, yeah, because my dad was managing. I thought that was the best.\n\nKelly: Did you almost envisage being a manager before a player?\n\nRoberto: Yes, because I never saw my dad play. And it was fascinating because when I came to the UK in 1995, straight away they tell you there is no 'I' in team. You have to adjust to the group and you have to do whatever it takes to be with the group. The reality doesn't work like that. It's the opposite. You have to address the 'I' before you can create a team. And sometimes you are in the corner of a room thinking... completely different culture, different background, and you expect it to perform without having help to be settled, to feel that you are valuable. There are many aspects that I learned from my own experience of being away from home. Without me knowing it, that was preparing me for that side. You need to get... a team to be together, to have the same goal and to be able to perform on the pitch.\n\nKelly: Other than your dad, who's had the biggest influence on Roberto Martinez the manager?\n\nRoberto: I was intrigued by Johan Cruyff - the way he managed Barcelona. He came in, he changed completely the way that the game was played. I think many, many people in the last 100 years have influenced the game, but I don't think anybody has influenced the game the way that Johan Cruyff did it, because it changed. It was more a technical game, it was a possession-based game, it was about a numerical advantage. And then you created the ones that didn't follow that way of football - they had to find a way to counter that style. I followed many other managers... I think what John Toshack did when he went to Real Sociedad and then went to Real Madrid. I love Pacho Maturana - what he did with the Colombian team. Arrigo Sacchi - so structured and rigorous and methodic. I always enjoyed how managers get their message across to the players and in a different way.\n\nKelly: Have you ever had an opportunity to go and watch any of those managers? We've spoken to Andoni Iraola and Brendan Rodgers this year, and they talked about managers that they went and learned from. Have you had anyone like that - any mentors or anything?\n\nRoberto: I was just watching games. I liked to watch a game and I tried to double-guess: 'How did that happen? How did you take the risk to get to the player to understand what you're trying?' I never went to see anybody work, but I followed many World Cups. I started managing in the Premier League in 2009. Every summer with my wife, I would invite her to go to South Africa first, and then Poland, and then Brazil, and then France. Our holidays were following the big tournaments!\n\nKelly: So she thought she was going on a lovely, exotic holiday, but she was actually going for a tournament...\n\nRoberto: I think the first time, yeah. The first time.\n\nRoberto: And then she knew. I still owe her. From this day, I still owe her a nice honeymoon - because the honeymoon when we got married was South Africa, and she was delighted. She didn't realise that it was the World Cup!\n\nKelly: You've obviously seen management from both sides as well - in terms of club management and international management. How do the two differ?\n\nRoberto: Coaching in the Premier League is about tomorrow and it was about preparing the game that is in front of you, preparing the players so they can make a difference in winning the game. International football is about trying to find out the best talent and then to make it in a structured way, to make it competitive - and you've got three days to do that. That's very different to doing it in a club. Everything is more tactically synchronised - everything can be more methodical. International football is about creating good mood, creating a sense of pride, creating high-performance teams that they follow in their dreams because when you represent your national team, it affects your family... the neighbours. If you win, the whole country wins. When you lose, the whole country loses. It's a completely different way of enjoying the game. I was fascinated about being involved in a World Cup - that was one of my dreams as a kid. The first World Cup I remember - 1978, Argentina - Mario Kempes, scoring in the final, then 1982 was in Spain, so it was a big impact. So for me, the move to international football was just to experience a World Cup. Then I enjoyed it so much that I stayed almost 10 seasons now.\n\nKelly: Let's discuss your time with Belgium, because what an incredible group of players you had there - the 'golden generation', they said. What challenges did that job bring with it and what did you get from that period?\n\nRoberto: First and foremost was to cope with that tag of 'golden generation'. It wasn't a pressure that the players were not used to because obviously you're talking about the players that were in the most demanding dressing rooms. From Eden Hazard to Kevin de Bruyne, Dries Mertens, Romelu Lukaku, Axel Witsel, Jan Vertonghen, Thomas Vermaelen, Vincent Kompany, Thibaut Courtois, Yannick Carrasco... you're talking about the generation. But I think we managed to focus on, 'OK, let's be as good as we can together and let's become the golden generation.'\n\nI think that was a beautiful journey to go to the World Cup in 2018. After seven games, we won six. We only lost the semi-final against France 1-0 - there were little margins - but then we came third by winning the bronze medal in the last game. That is the moment that it became the golden generation. At that moment, it was a shift into what we could do from that point on and that team stayed four years consecutively with the number one ranking. It was a very interesting time to try to get a focus of everybody having that common goal that was trying to make history for Belgian football and it was really, really enjoyable.\n\nKelly: I always ask in these interviews for my interviewee to tell me a game from their career, playing or managerial, that they wish they could relive...\n\nRoberto: I think if I could relive a game it would be the semi-final with Belgium against France because we lost 1-0. I felt we were the better team - we had almost 60% possession - and it was just decided by one action... and if it is one game that I could relive to try to change it, it would be that one.\n\nKelly: Do you think about it a lot, or are you able to just park it now?\n\nRoberto: No, sometimes I like to think about it. If we were going to play it again with the same situation, what could have been done differently? And that helps. I think the margins are so small. You've got the best players possible of two generations and I think you can learn from already having the experience of being in a game like that.\n\nKelly: And you've not got a bad crop of players now at Portugal, have you? You've already won the Nations League and what an opportunity potentially ahead for you. The pressure is going to be there again.\n\nRoberto: But it's an enjoyable pressure because it is true... we arrived in Portugal - huge tradition, always created big players through the history now that we celebrated the moment that Eusebio won the Ballon d'Or in 1965. You've got players like Luis Figo, Joao Pinto, Rui Costa... it's a tradition in Portugal, but they won everything apart from the World Cup. We got an incredible commitment from the players because this is probably a mixture of four generations. You've got the captain [Cristiano Ronaldo], who is 41 years old, to the youngest player who was born the year the captain made his debut for the national team. So, we're looking forward. The first step was to qualify. We did that and I always believe that there has never been a winning team that arrives to the tournament. The winning team becomes the winning team in the tournament.\n\nKelly: That captain, of course, is Cristiano Ronaldo. What's it like managing him?\n\nRoberto: Very easy, because of his high standards, his expectations of how the work should be done and his commitment to the game. He truly is an example of what you should do to represent Portugal and the national team. And now he's adapted, obviously, after 21 years in the national team - he's adjusted. He's a goalscorer, he's an important player for us, and it's the player that he is now that is important for me. As a national team coach, a player that has scored 25 goals in the last 30 international games... it's not that he's playing because of what he's done in the past, it's what he's done now.\n\nKelly: The question everyone's asking at the moment is: 'How long can he go on for?' As someone that's seen him close up, how long do you think he can keep playing for?\n\nRoberto: Well, we got all the stats. If you were going to analyse a player that is dropping at physical level, that's not the case. His physical stats are of a player that could go on and on and on. I think it's more a question of when he'll feel that is the right time. I think he's a player that is very critical with himself. When he doesn't see that he can help the team, he'll be the one that will decide when to stop.\n\nKelly: You've got two girls and you're married to a Scottish lady, is that correct?\n\nKelly: Is that from your time in Scotland?\n\nRoberto: In Motherwell, yeah. That was the best thing!\n\nKelly: So that must be quite the culture kind of mix at home?\n\nRoberto: Especially when you are the international team coach of Portugal playing against Scotland. I think it's been four times now that we played with Belgium against Scotland. Obviously with my wife, it's not a problem. It's more the in-laws - it's difficult for them to support a team that is different than Scotland! But, no, that's part of the fun. I'm very, very lucky and probably that's the biggest achievement that I want to have in my life is to be the best father that I can be and the best husband that I can be. Everything else is going to be just part of the journey.\n\nKelly: Tell me something about yourself that might surprise me.\n\nRoberto: I've never tasted alcohol.\n\nRoberto: Yeah. And it was a promise. When I was 16 and I had the opportunity to go to Zaragoza, I went to my dad and I said: 'I really want to go.' And I said: 'What do you think?' He said: Well, it's the worst thing you could do because you're going to be very young - 16. You're going to be away from home and the first thing you're going to do is start drinking, start smoking, you're going to give up your studies.' And I said: 'Well, I promise you, I'll do my degree, I'll never drink, I'll never smoke.' And then since that day, that was my commitment, so I'm 52 now and I'm proud to say that I never touched a drop of alcohol.\n\nKelly: If you were to win the World Cup next summer...?\n\nRoberto: Probably, yes, I would be quite happy to make another commitment!\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "When James Trafford arrived back at Manchester City in June for a fee of about £30m, he would have been hoping to emerge as the club's number-one goalkeeper.\n\nAnd he started this season in that role, featuring in City's first three Premier League games of the campaign.\n\nBut Gianluigi Donnarumma's arrival ripped up the pecking order.\n\nCity seized their chance to bring in one of the world's best keepers when the Italian became surplus to requirements at Paris St-Germain on summer deadline day.\n\nDonnarumma has played 30 matches for City since then, with Trafford having had to settle for domestic cup games - plus one Champions League appearance.\n\nAfter keeping a clean sheet in the FA Cup fourth-round win over Salford City on Saturday, Trafford admitted the current situation is not what he had imagined.\n\nWhen asked about being City's cup goalkeeper, Trafford told the BBC: \"It wasn't what I expected coming into the season...\n\n\"It's the reality and I have to give it my best shot. It's the situation I'm in. We train every day but making saves, it's good fun.\"\n\nTrafford played 45 games last season as Burnley won promotion to the Premier League, conceding just 16 goals in the Championship in the process.\n\nThe 23-year-old then decided it was time to tackle unfinished business at City, who he had left in 2023 in search of regular playing time.\n\nBut the arrival of Champions League winner Donnarumma, who is only 26, has dented Trafford's hopes of making a mark this time around.\n\nFrom 'demoralising' 8-0 defeat to pushing Man City all the way\n\nGuehi scores first Man City goal in win over Salford\n\nWith Ederson regressing last season, City boss Pep Guardiola had clearly plotted to overhaul his goalkeeping department.\n\nRe-signing Trafford from Burnley in June seemed the sensible option - a keeper with plenty of experience for his age who had spent six years in the club's academy and impressed for England's Under-21s.\n\nTrafford had also been picked as part of England's initial 33-man squad for Euro 2024 - although he did not make the final cut - and a role as City's number one could have bolstered his senior international prospects.\n\nBut he has not featured in a Three Lions squad since November and a spot at this summer's World Cup now appears to be unlikely amid his lack of game time.\n\n\"I feel sorry for Trafford,\" former City goalkeeper Nicky Weaver told BBC Radio Manchester in December. \"When he signed, he probably thought he was going to be number one.\n\n\"We don't exactly know what he was told, but when you get the opportunity to bring someone in of Donnarumma's quality and at his age as well, for a relatively moderate fee, you have to take that opportunity. I feel for Trafford, I really like him.\n\n\"It's the life of a goalkeeper. I've been number one, number two and three. It's really difficult. You don't see a way into the team for him.\n\n\"He just has to stick in there, he can learn a lot off Donnarumma but I'm sure he would learn if he was playing every week.\"\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Scotland delivered a magnificent Calcutta Cup triumph for under-pressure head coach Gregor Townsend, according to captain Sione Tuipulotu.",
    "fullText": "Scotland delivered a magnificent Calcutta Cup triumph for under-pressure head coach Gregor Townsend after a week of \"guilt\", says captain Sione Tuipulotu.\n\nOff the back of an opening Six Nations defeat by Italy in torrential Rome rain which triggered a sharpened focus on Townsend's tenure, Scotland's title chances were on the line as they welcomed in-form England to Murrayfield.\n\nAnd they delivered a spectacular opening burst, racing into a 17-0 lead inside 15 minutes, one which they never looked like surrendering.\n\nTownsend's side played with pace and verve as Finn Russell stamped his mark on this famous old fixture.\n\nThe Scotland fly-half set up Huw Jones' first try with a gorgeous tap-on pass before spreading the play right and then left for Jamie Ritchie to go over.\n\nEven when England hit back through Henry Arundell - who was subsequently sent off for a second yellow card offence - Scotland continued to play with freedom and confidence and they added a third after Ellis Genge failed to gather Russell's chip over the top and Ben White capitalised.\n\nThe visitors, having won their past 12 Tests, came back into the contest after half-time but Scotland stood strong in defence and scored a bonus-point try through Jones after George Ford's drop-goal attempt was charged down.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud,\" Tuipulotu said.\n\n\"To go through what we went through last week really hurt and we understood because we deserved it. Ultimately Italy were better than us.\n\n\"We really felt like our backs were against the wall and we showed up today.\n\n\"I felt guilty. Head coaching is a hard job because when it is going well you get all the positives but when it is not going well you get all of the criticism.\n\n\"We got behind our coach this week. I'm proud of the boys for getting behind our coach and delivering a performance.\"\n\nScotland Rugby Podcast: Reaction from a jubilant Murrayfield\n\nScotland now head to Spain to recover before their third match of the championship against Wales next weekend.\n\nTuipulotu says they will do everything in their power to kick on from this impressive victory.\n\n\"I want to enjoy tonight with my team-mates but make no mistake we'll be all hands on deck,\" the Glasgow Warriors centre said.\n\n\"We'll prepare to the best of our abilities to back up this performance.\"\n\nAnd former Scotland skipper John Barclay says they have to do that if they want to move forwards as a team.\n\n\"They need to back it up,\" he said on ITV.\n\n\"Sione and Gregor have spoken about that, so we know that's what their focus will be. The very best sides, the drop-off isn't as big.\"\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win\n\nTownsend 'very proud of team' - relive how Scotland humbled England to regain Calcutta Cup\n\nIt has been a tough spell for Townsend, perhaps the toughest of his nine-year tenure at the helm.\n\nThree defeats in the four Tests before this match, as well as ongoing links to a full-time role with Newcastle Red Bulls post-World Cup were hanging over the former fly-half, with some fans and pundits suggesting he had taken the national team as far as he could.\n\nBut he says that first-half display was some of the finest rugby he has seen from a Scotland team.\n\n\"After 20 minutes I thought that was some of the best rugby we've ever played,\" he told ITV.\n\n\"It's all you want as a coach and then to see the effort in the second half, we became a team that would fight for each other and the supporters.\n\n\"We know that rugby brings out the best in us, being very aggressive and playing at speed. I thought that was one of Finn Russell's best games for Scotland and the work-rate of our forwards was superb.\"\n\nScotland have now won five of the past six Calcutta Cup matches, and it was inches from being six - Russell's missed conversion denying the Scots at Twickenham last year.\n\n\"I thought they made England look pretty mediocre,\" former Scotland prop Peter Wright said.\n\n\"What frustrates me about Scotland is they can give you a performance like this, but they can also give you a performance like they did in Italy.\n\n\"The players deserve all the plaudits.\"\n\nTownsend dismissed the notion that Scotland only deliver their best performances against England.\n\n\"We have played some of our best rugby against England and that's great,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know why people see a negative in that, it's our biggest game. It seems to be a narrative that it's a negative that we do well in this fixture. We only see positives, and I reminded our players how well we've done in this fixture.\n\n\"I'm very proud of the team. I was proud of them last week, we went 29 phases in monsoon conditions, starting from our own try line to try and win that game.\n\n\"You ask so much of the players during the week and they put it in at the weekend. If they don't turn up with a victory it's not down to their energy and effort. I was proud of them last week and I'm proud of them this week.\"",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.\n\nThe women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.\n\nSuch arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThey are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.\n\nOther activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.\n\n“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.\n\nSo far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.\n\nNazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.\n\nThe protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.\n\nSecurity forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\n\nGholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran’s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters “terrorists” and calling for fast-tracked punishments.\n\nSince then, “detentions have been very widespread because it’s like a whole suffocation of society,” said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\nThe Nakhii sisters, 25-year-old Nyusha and 37-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.\n\nOther people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.\n\nAtila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.\n\nAuthorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters' relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.\n\nIn past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.\n\n“The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been,” Barzin said.\n\nDespite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.\n\nThe Writers’ Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.”\n\nIt also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.\n\nA national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. “Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children’s names public,” it said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.\n\n“Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”\n\nBar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran’s state-sanctioned doctors council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.\n\nAnger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.\n\nThe Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.\n\nIran’s theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nStill, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran’s leadership “for the first time is afraid of being overthrown.”\n\nThis story corrects ages for Nyusha and Mona.",

    "fullText": "Federal authorities announced an investigation Friday into two immigration officers who appeared to have made untruthful statements under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis last month.\n\nIt is among at least five shootings in which initial descriptions by the immigration officials were later contradicted by video evidence. Those included the fatal Minneapolis shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, where bystander video quickly raised questions about how they were initially described.\n\nThe probe Friday came hours after a federal judge dismissed felony assault charges against two Venezuelan men who were accused of beating an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer with a broom handle and a snow shovel on Jan. 14. The officer, who is not named in court filings, fired a single shot from a handgun that struck one of the men, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, in the thigh.\n\nIn an unusual reversal, prosecutors asked to dismiss the cases because they said new video evidence contradicted allegations made against the men in a criminal complaint and at a hearing last month.\n\nHere is a look at how the five shootings were initially described and what was later learned:\n\nDate and location: Jan. 14, 2026, in Minneapolis\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the immigration officer was “ambushed” by Sosa-Celis and others, and fired a “defensive shot” out of fear for his life. “What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,” she said.\n\nWhat came out later: Investigators have not released the new evidence that led charges to be dropped, but cracks were already apparent in a Jan. 21 court hearing. The immigration officer’s testimony recounting the moments before the shooting differed significantly from that of the defendants and three eyewitnesses. Available video evidence did not support the officer’s account of being assaulted with a broom and shovel.\n\nDate and location: Jan. 7, 2026, in Minneapolis\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle.\" She said the immigration agent shot “defensively” to protect himself and the people around him. Good died of gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nWhat came out later: Videos filmed from multiple angles challenged the administration’s narrative. Shortly before the shooting Good is seen at the wheel of her SUV that is parked diagonally on a street. She tells an immigration officer, “I'm not mad at you.”\n\nSeconds later, another immigration officer grabs at the driver’s side door while Good’s wife urges her to “drive, baby, drive.” It’s unclear in the videos if the SUV makes contact with ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who shoots while standing in front of the vehicle and then twice more while quickly moving to the driver's side of the SUV as it pulls forward.\n\nDate and location: Jan. 24, 2026, in Minneapolis\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Pretti approached Border Patrol officers with a handgun and he “violently resisted” when they tried to disarm him. An agent feared for his life and fired defensive shots, she said. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene. Border Patrol senior official Greg Bovino claimed Pretti intended to “massacre law enforcement,\" and Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller described him as “a would-be assassin.\"\n\nWhat came out later: None of the half-dozen bystander videos collected by investigators showed Pretti brandishing his gun, which he had a permit to carry. The videos showed Pretti was holding his mobile phone as a masked Border Patrol officer opened fire.\n\nIn a tense hearing Thursday in Washington, Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky made leaders tasked with carrying out Trump’s mass deportation agenda watch a video of the shooting while he repeatedly scrutinized the forceful tactics used by immigration agents. Paul argued that Pretti posed no threat to the agents and said it was clear from the video that he was “retreating at every moment.”\n\nDate and location: Sept. 12, 2025, in suburban Chicago\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: Homeland Security officials said federal agents were pursuing a man with a history of reckless driving who entered the country illegally. They alleged Silverio Villegas González drove at officers and dragged one with his car. DHS said the officer fired because he feared for his life and was hospitalized with “serious injuries.\"\n\nWhat came out later: Body camera videos from local police contradicted the Trump administration’s account. Footage showed the agent who shot Villegas González walking around afterward and dismissing his own injuries as “nothing major.”\n\nAn autopsy made public in November declared Villegas González's death a homicide. The report showed he was shot at “close range,” with wounds to his neck and fingers.\n\nDate and location: Oct. 14, 2025, in Chicago\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: A DHS news release asserted that Martinez and the driver of another car involved in a crash with a Border Patrol officer were “domestic terrorists.” An FBI agent said in court documents that she was chasing the Border Patrol vehicle and drove at one of the officers after they got out of the vehicle. The officer was forced to open fire, the FBI agent alleged, striking Martinez seven times. She was treated at a hospital and arrested on felony assault charges.\n\nWhat came out later: Videos emerged that her attorneys said showed agent Charles Exum steering his SUV into her truck.\n\nIn a text message presented during a Nov. 5 hearing, Exum appeared to brag about his marksmanship. “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,\" the text read.\n\nThe case against her was dismissed.",

    "description": "Burnley manager Scott Parker is under increasing pressure as the Premier League side are dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Mansfield.",
    "fullText": "League One Mansfield produced an FA Cup fairytale to remember at Turf Moor on Saturday, but for Premier League strugglers Burnley, it was another afternoon to forget.\n\nLouis Reed's 80th-minute free-kick into the top corner of the Clarets' goal was a cue for 3,500 travelling Mansfield fans to erupt in sheer delight.\n\nFor the home faithful, it had the opposite affect - boos and jeers started coming from large sections at Turf Moor, and at full-time it became a cacophony of discontent.\n\nWith just two wins in their past 19 games in all competitions and nine points adrift of safety in the Premier League, an FA Cup run represented the last bit of hope in what has been a dismal return to the top flight.\n\n\"The pressure is on Scott Parker from a certain section of the Burnley fans, they think his time is up,\" Chris Sutton said on BBC Final Score.\n\nThe teams immediately around Burnley in the Premier League table have all changed their managers this season. Could they be next?\n\nLosing to the team 13th in English football's third tier represents a new low in Burnley's season just as renewed optimism was starting to creep in.\n\nTheir remarkable 3-2 comeback win at Crystal Palace on Wednesday was their first victory in 16 Premier League games. The gloom started to lift slightly.\n\nParker's side showed real fight and spirit at Selhurst Park, which made his decision to make nine changes to his team for the visit of Mansfield all the more baffling.\n\n\"When you don't go through to the next round there will always be questions asked about that [team selection] but I don't think that was the main factor today,\" Parker told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We lacked a little something in those final moments. That was where we have fallen way short today.\"\n\nBurnley are not the first, nor will they be the last, Premier League side to ring the changes for a cup game against lower opposition.\n\nBut having been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Cardiff City back in September, the FA Cup was the supporters' only chance to distract themselves from looming relegation.\n\n\"It is embarrassing, the changes he made. Play your strongest team. He made nine changes, and the second half was embarrassing,\" former Burnley defender David Unsworth said on BBC Radio Lancashire.\n\n\"It is an embarrassing afternoon for Burnley. It gives the owner a decision to make now. He has to listen to the fans, they are not happy.\n\n\"For the first time I have witnessed all home ends of the stadium booing and disgruntlement. The owner has a decision to make.\"\n\nChairman Alan Pace, the leader of the club's owners ALK Capital, is not the most popular at Turf Moor either at the moment.\n\nThis week he angered fans when, during an interview with BBC Football Focus, he dismissed fan concerns as coming from those who \"just play this game on a computer somewhere\".\n\nHe went on to liken those same fans to three-year-old toddlers having a tantrum.\n\nPace used Saturday's programme notes to clarify his words, writing: \"I did not intend for my words to upset, but I did mean what I was trying to say which was that, just because some are upset, does not mean that things are dire and without hope.\"\n\nMany Burnley fans will be hoping Pace calls time on Parker's spell in charge, though the former Premier League midfielder said he is confident is his own position at the club.\n\n\"I am very comfortable in my position at this present moment in time. We have lost a game of football today against a team we should be beating,\" Parker told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We had numerous chances. Of course you are always going to judge a result and today is a bad one, we take the flak for that, the team and myself.\"\n\nLeague One Mansfield shock Burnley in FA Cup\n\nWhile Burnley's failures were significant, it's important not to underplay Mansfield's achievement.\n\nThe Stags have eliminated a top-flight side from the FA Cup for the first time since February 1969, and will now play in the fifth round for the first time since 1974-75.\n\nDespite falling behind early on, Nigel Clough's side dug deep and hung in - Kyle Knoyle's heroic goalline clearance at 1-0 was typical of their spirit.\n\nWhen their chances came, they took them. Rhys Oates headed in the equaliser shortly after the break, before captain Reed produced a free-kick his club's fans will never forget.\n\n\"As soon as it left my boot I felt it going in. I have been working on them throughout the week. The lads said, 'This is your moment, go and take it'. Thankfully, I did,\" said Reed.\n\n\"It shows what a group we have got. The draws we keep getting are big ones. I felt we were always in the game even when we were 1-0 down at half-time.\n\n\"I think it's a cliche, whoever we get in the next round, we will go into that with the same energy as this one.\"\n\nSutton said: \"It's an amazing story and Nigel Clough, at the helm, has done a brilliant job at Mansfield.\n\n\"To think Mansfield came from behind against Premier League opposition, they kept on peppering Burnley's goal, but the free-kick from Louis Reed deserves to win any cup tie.\"\n\nWin a cup tie it did - but it could also end up costing Parker his job.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "A medallist with Team GB in 2014, bobsleigher Joel Fearon is preparing for his third Winter Olympics after coming out of retirement to compete for Jamaica.",
    "fullText": "\"The fastest man in the UK this year and he's not even going to the Olympics.\"\n\nThat was the line belted out by the commentator as Joel Fearon stunned onlookers by running the 100m in under 10 seconds - breaking one of the most revered barriers in sport.\n\nFrustratingly, the performance came just after the cut-off date to qualify him to represent Team GB at Rio 2016.\n\nA decade on, the 37-year-old is at his third Winter Olympics, but his first for Jamaica's bobsleigh team, who he came out of retirement for last year.\n\nHe remembers that day in 2016 as one that changed his life.\n\n\"I don't know if I ever believed that I could do something like that,\" he told BBC Local Radio.\n\n\"It was surreal for a long time because I wasn't one of the British superstar sprinters.\n\n\"But there I was, running sub-10, number one in the country and I remember thinking anything can happen.\"\n\nOnly four British men have ever run faster on UK soil than his time of 9.96 seconds to win the England Athletics Championships in Bedford that day.\n\nRunning fast was just one piece of the jigsaw for Coventry-born Fearon, as he was trying to make ends meet, juggling between work and bobsleigh training.\n\n\"I've done all sorts of jobs, at one point, I was a pizza delivery man,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I would run Diamond Leagues in the daytime. In the evening, I'm off delivering my local pizzas, just whatever needed to be done.\"\n\nAthletics was Fearon's first sporting passion, but his bobsleigh career has been unique.\n\nHe has competed for Great Britain, Switzerland and Jamaica over a period of 15 years.\n\nHis bronze medal from the Sochi 2014 Olympics was only awarded five years later because of retrospective doping bans.\n\nThe sport was initially suggested to him by his coach, partly to help support his family.\n\n\"I was pretty broke and some trials came up,\" Fearon explained.\n\n\"It was a tough transition, there is a lot of lifting, you are a mechanic and there are a lot of long hours and time spent out in freezing cold conditions.\n\n\"If I didn't hold out [on] those rough days, I would have never known what was coming in the future.\"\n\nWelsh bobsleigher Moore makes Olympics for Jamaica\n\nHow British skeleton came back fighting after 2022\n\nWinter Olympics athletes to have broken medals fixed\n\nFearon initially came fifth in the four-man bobsleigh in Sochi, and with hindsight, he would not change the way it happened.\n\n\"We knew we were good enough. Knowing that we didn't [medal] actually just kept me striving,\" he said.\n\n\"I went straight to a relay camp. I didn't soak it in, didn't even enjoy it.\n\n\"If I would have got that medal, I probably wouldn't have run sub-10. I wouldn't have had the same drive.\"\n\nAt the time Fearon received it, he was on a season-long loan to Switzerland's bobsleigh team, with whom he won another bronze at the Europe Cup.\n\n\"They bought me, actually. They needed experienced athletes for one of their junior drivers, Timo Rohner,\" he remembered.\n\n\"We were the Swiss number one team that year. [Rohner] is at the Olympics with me [at Milan-Cortina], that's nice because this is his first Olympics and I had a little part in his journey.\"\n\nLike many athletes, Fearon's career has been affected by agonising injuries at key moments.\n\nHe has wires in his lower leg bones holding them together, following a serious one picked up while running for the British relay team.\n\n\"After that, I semi-retired from athletics, I still went and did a few things, but it wasn't the same,\" he said.\n\n\"It took a good two-year chunk out of my athletic career.\"\n\nBut while that pain eased over time as he recovered, what hit his family next was hard to put into words.\n\nIn 2023, his sister Natasha Morais was murdered.\n\nFeeling scared and suffering with insomnia, Fearon retired from all sport.\n\n\"It was tough for all of us. We are all still dealing with it in our own ways,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't think I was ever going to be able to do sport again. I really struggled with anxiety.\n\n\"I was becoming afraid to leave my family alone.\"\n\nComing out of retirement to represent Jamaica has given Fearon fresh focus and brought joy to a grieving family.\n\nBut he did not necessarily expect to be pushing a sled at another Winter Olympics.\n\n\"It was an athlete and coach role, I can do all the jobs across bobsleigh, even just organisational jobs,\" said Fearon, who met rapper Snoop Dogg while training in Italy.\n\n\"But we ended up getting in the sled. I've done six races and won six races, so I'm a pretty good lucky charm.\n\n\"I think they're going to have me pushing a few more times before I'm done,\" he joked.\n\nFearon's father is Jamaican, while his maternal grandparents are also from the Caribbean island.\n\n\"My dad was so proud. I've never seen him excited about sport before,\" he added.\n\n\"I didn't even know these guys a year ago and they're all like my brothers, I get more excited about them racing than I do myself racing.\n\n\"I'm probably taking on a dad role. Seeing how much they're excelling, it's just really exciting for me to watch and wonder where it could go.\"\n\nThe crossover between Fearon's two sports is a well-travelled path.\n\nFellow sprinter and bobsleigher Mica Moore is also part of Jamaica's squad in Milan-Cortina, having previously switched allegiance from Great Britain.\n\nFour years ago, Montell Douglas became GB's first female summer and Winter Olympian, while this year, track and field internationals Adele Nicoll and Ashleigh Nelson are in their squad.\n\nThey all have explosive power and speed over the initial acceleration phase where pushing the sled effectively is so vital.\n\nBut perhaps the crossover that Fearon is most excited about is the association with the 1993 hit film Cool Runnings about the Jamaican bobsleigh team.\n\n\"I love it, because I watched it when I was 10,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I had no idea I was ever going to have anything to do with bobsleigh at that point, never mind Jamaican bobsleigh.\n\n\"I've gone from being an Olympic medallist and part of this team, which is great, but now I'm a Disney character. Now I'm in a movie, it's different.\n\n\"We are the most famous team in the world, so it's for us to go out and do our flag proud.\"",

    "fullText": "Captain Michele Lamaro eloquently summed up how the perception around Italy has changed after they fell short in their bid for back-to-back Six Nations wins in Saturday's absorbing contest against Ireland.\n\nAfter beating Scotland in Rome, Italy arrived in Dublin with confidence and were the better team for large periods against the Irish, who withstood intense pressure from the Azzurri in the closing stages to win 20-13.\n\nAnd after Italy boss Gonzalo Quesada spoke of his pride in his team's performance, Lamaro was asked about their growing belief.\n\n\"This is my fifth year as a captain in the Six Nations and I remember my first year, the main question was, 'what do you think about Italy leaving the Six Nations?',\" said the Benetton back row.\n\n\"I've never believed that in a couple of years you can change things up too much. I always have a humble mindset because I know how much it takes to get to that level to be able to come here and perform and compete against an unbelievable team like Ireland.\n\n\"The perception means a lot. The belief we've created, I didn't have that growing up.\n\n\"I grew up with us being last in the table and that's the thing I'm most proud of, me coming through with a bunch of guys who might be able to win the championship one day.\"\n\nIreland survive Italy scare to claim first win\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nLamaro, who was named Italy captain by Quesada's predecessor Kieran Crowley in 2021, added that the squad wants to \"inspire people\".\n\n\"Inspiring people around us, inspiring the kids coming through, giving them the chances we didn't have,\" added the 27-year-old.\n\n\"That's what we want to create. Sometimes it's tough because you find yourself in a tough situation but trusting the process is what you can do to have long-term ambition and legacy you can create.\n\n\"That makes us really proud and thank you for that [saying that Italy have improved] because it makes us proud to see how much the perception of the team has changed.\"\n\nWhen Quesada and Lamaro last led Italy into a match in Dublin, they lost 36-0.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, the Azzurri faced an Irish side lacking confidence after a bruising defeat by France in Paris last week.\n\n\"Obviously we wanted to take advantage of that. We knew if we put them under scoreboard pressure, it would have been very difficult for them.\n\n\"I've been in that situation before around mindsets. You have to perform and beat the team in front of you but if you're down after 20, 30 minutes, it can become a real pain in...I don't say where.\n\n\"They have some unbelievable players and they showed how much they care for this group and country. You always expect Ireland to be a world-class team.\n\n\"Ups and downs happen to every team in the world. At the moment, they haven't been what they want to be but I'm pretty sure they have all the abilities to get back.\"\n\nLamaro also ended Italy's post-match news conference with an unprompted tribute to Hollie Davidson after the Scottish official became the first woman to referee a men's Six Nations game.\n\n\"I just want to congratulate her,\" he said.\n\n\"She has been doing so much for world rugby and our game and I think it's an important thing to say.\n\n\"I appreciated the work we did together today on the pitch.\n\n\"Whatever the decision was, I was backing her and making sure everything was going the right way so I just want to congratulate her and thank her for the effort on the field.\"",

    "description": "This sandwich chain has dwindled from thousands of locations to several hundred. Armed with a new CEO and game plan, the brand hopes to relive its glory days.",
    "fullText": "If you have fond memories of hot chicken carbonara and black angus steakhouse subs (not to mention those bizarre Quiznos spongmonkeys), but have a hard time finding them now, it's because the chain has dwindled to a fraction of what it once was. Quiznos had around 5,000 outlets globally in the early 2000s, of which about 4,700 were in the U.S.. Then, in the decade between 2007 and 2017, it lost a whopping 90% of its outlets. Despite filing for bankruptcy in 2014, Quiznos continued to plummet. The precipitous fall was a result of multiple factors, including a business model that essentially earned money by squeezing franchisee profits. While still a shadow of its Subway-competing days, Quiznos is making moves that could be the start of a comeback.\n\nQuiznos' rapid decline in the early 21st century is proof of just how quickly fortunes can change in the QSR industry. Even Subway, the sandwich chain Quiznos played second fiddle to for years, is at its lowest restaurant count in the United States in the last 20 years after closing over 600 locations in 2024. In contrast, the Quiznos outlet that opened in Tucson, Arizona, that same year broke the company's opening day sales record. At its current relatively small scale, the hot sub brand is nimble and trying a ton of new things, some of which are starting to stick. New partnerships, a novel modular restaurant format that could significantly speed up expansion, and the self-awareness to not repeat past mistakes are all part of the new Quiznos.\n\nWhen Quiznos opened in 1981 and started dishing out hot subs, it attracted significant attention and business. Now, the company is going to have to do a lot more to differentiate itself. The revival mantra is a comprehensive overhaul from the ground up. Acquired by the Rego Restaurant Group in 2018 and under a new CEO since March 2025, the Quiznos turnaround started with its outlets and updated kitchen equipment. The toaster has made way for deep fryers and grills, resulting in more varied flavors and faster prep for a high-potential drive-thru sales category. New items like the Asian Steak Dipper, the Steakhouse Philly, and even a vegetarian protein-based Beyond Italian Sausage sandwich are all joining Quiznos fan favorites on the updated menu.\n\nThe company's partnership with the Nebraska-based convenience store and gas chain Pump and Pantry in 2022 has also added fuel to the fire (pun intended). After four successful outlets, the company plans on adding six more to its roster. Expansion remains crucial to success, which has led to Quiznos' innovative Qube concept. These prefabricated outlets require less time and space to set up and come fully equipped, making the opening of new outlets a more streamlined affair. Most importantly, this entices franchisees.",

    "description": "Thirteen months after being embarrassed 8-0 by Manchester City, Salford City produce a performance to make their fans proud.",
    "fullText": "Salford City arrived at Etihad Stadium with a certain amount of trepidation, the scars of last season's 8-0 FA Cup defeat still fresh in the mind.\n\nThis time the League Two club left Manchester City's home with their heads held high after going toe-to-toe with the club still hoping to pull off an unprecedented quadruple this season.\n\n\"It was demoralising last season, our confidence dipped,\" Salford captain Luke Garbutt told BBC Sport after pushing their opponents all the way before losing 2-0.\n\n\"Today is a totally different feel.\n\n\"On another day we would've got a goal. To come away with 2-0 when it was 8-0 last season shows the club is on the rise.\"\n\nSalford, the club co-owned by Manchester United stars Gary Neville and David Beckham, were playing in the fourth round for the first time in their history.\n\nAnd they were in the tie right up to the moment substitute Marc Guehi doubled the lead with his first Manchester City goal since a £20m move from Crystal Palace in the 81st minute.\n\n\"They defended so well,\" said Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola. \"They had more chances near the end, they were really good.\"\n\nGuehi scores first Man City goal in win over Salford\n\n'Not what I expected' - Trafford on Man City back-up role\n\nSalford's players stayed on the pitch a good five minutes after the full-time whistle to show their appreciation to their travelling fans.\n\n\"Why did you bring that up?\" manager Karl Robinson joked in his post-match press conference, when a reporter mentioned last season's eight-goal drubbing.\n\nHe must have feared his side were facing another hammering when Alfie Dorrington scored an own goal in the sixth minute.\n\nThe visitors, however, regrouped.\n\nNot only did they prevent their opponents from registering an attempt on target before half-time, they twice went close to scoring themselves through Ben Woodburn and Brandon Cooper.\n\nIt was still only 1-0 when James Trafford denied Kelly N'Mai, before Guardiola sent on Antoine Semenyo, Nico O'Reilly, Rodri and Guehi, the latter eventually easing home nerves nine minutes from the end.\n\n\"It's about us using this as a benchmark to move forward,\" added Robinson, whose side sit sixth in the fourth tier of English football.\n\n\"We couldn't do that last season. We have to get out of League Two.\n\n\"It was a fantastic defensive performance against one of the best teams in Europe.\n\n\"They had to bring on four of their best players in the last 20 minutes. We dust ourselves off and get ready for Tuesday [Newport County at home].\"\n\nFormer Manchester City midfielder Michael Brown, who was at Etihad Stadium for BBC Sport, said Salford will learn from Saturday's experience.\n\n\"For Salford to get to this stage they have done well,\" he added.\n\n\"The test was there with this draw, but Robinson will have learned a lot about his players.\"\n\nGarbutt added: \"They are a world-class team and they are going to create chances and score good goals but we kept that to a minimum.\"\n\nGuardiola mentioned in his pre-match news conference how he \"enjoys\" playing FA Cup ties away from home against League One and League Two clubs.\n\n\"When you arrive at the stadium on the coach and all the fans sing 'Who are ya?! Who are ya?!\" added Guardiola.\n\nOn Saturday, Salford's 3,900 fans inside Etihad Stadium made themselves heard as the visitors took the game to their Premier League opponents.\n\nAfterwards, Guardiola labelled his side's 41st game of the season \"boring\".\n\n\"It has been tough but not just this two weeks, since November it's been every three days and that's a lot,\" he added.\n\n\"The good news is we go through.\n\n\"We have to move the ball quick to the opposite side and we didn't do it. That's why it was boring.\"\n\nCity might not have been at their best but it's now 17 FA Cup wins in a row at Etihad Stadium since a 2-0 defeat by Middlesbrough back in 2015.",

    "description": "Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane became the first Englishman to reach 500 career goals on Saturday, but what other records could he break?",
    "fullText": "Harry Kane has made history by becoming the first Englishman to reach 500 professional goals in official games.\n\nThe Bayern Munich striker hit the milestone with a brace against Werder Bremen on Saturday.\n\nKane was already the highest-scoring Englishman, having surpassed Jimmy Greaves' total of 474 in December.\n\nIt has been another remarkable goal-scoring season for Kane, who has 26 goals in just 22 Bundesliga games. And it is only February.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at how Kane has scored his goals and what other records he could break.\n\nKane's first goal in professional football came 15 years ago when he scored as a 17-year-old playing for Leyton Orient against Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nThat was one of five goals he got for the O's before he went on to score two goals for Leicester, nine for Millwall, 280 for Tottenham and is currently on 126 goals for Bayern Munich.\n\nKane is also the highest-scoring man for England with 78 goals for the Three Lions.\n\nAlmost half of his goals have come in the Premier League (213). After that he has scored 89 in the Bundesliga while he has also been prolific in the Champions League.\n\nHe was already by far and away the highest-scoring Englishman in European football elite club competition as he currently sits on 48 goals, 18 more than Wayne Rooney, who sits second on that list.\n\nKane has also scored in every competition he has played in.\n\nGreaves' record as the highest-scoring Englishman stood for six decades until Kane overtook his tally two months ago.\n\nKane left the Premier League as the second-highest scorer in the competition, with Alan Shearer holding the record with 260 goals.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), Shearer sits fourth in the all-time list of English scorers with 409 goals, with Steve Bloomer - who played in the early part of the 20th century - third with 412 goals, behind Greaves and Kane.\n\nDixie Dean sits fifth with 396 top-level goals and Rooney is sixth on 360.\n\nKane is a master at taking penalties and a fifth of his 500 goals have come from the spot.\n\nIn open play he is deadly inside the box with 349 of his goals coming from there.\n\nThe vast majority of his goals have come from his right foot (318) with 94 of them being headers.\n\nThe goal that saw him reach 500 was of the type that is quite rare for Kane. He struck from distance, making it one of 49 he has scored from outside the box.\n\nKane reached 500 goals in 743 appearances for club and country.\n\nThat means he got to the milestone quicker than Portugal legend Cristiano Ronaldo, who in 2015 hit his 500th goal on his 753rd game in professional football.\n\nHowever, Lionel Messi was the quickest of the three to reach the landmark.\n\nThe Argentina star scored his 500th goal in April 2016 on what was his 632nd professional appearance. That's 121 matches faster than Ronaldo and 111 games quicker than Kane.\n\nKane is already England's record scorer but there's a few other things at club level he can aim for.\n\nRobert Lewandowski holds the record for the most goals scored in a single Bundesliga season, having hit 41 in 2020-21.\n\nKane is certainly in a good position to surpass that tally as he currently has 26 goals with 12 games remaining.\n\nIn Europe, he could break his own record - having become the highest-scoring Englishman in a single Champions League campaign when he scored 11 last term. He is currently on eight goals.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Newcastle United beat Aston Villa in the FA Cup fourth round in a match dominated by a number of controversial decisions without VAR.",
    "fullText": "Has there ever been a better advert for the video assistant referee?\n\nNewcastle's 3-1 FA Cup fourth-round win at Aston Villa was full of controversy with the video assistant referee (VAR) once again the big talking point - even though it wasn't even in use.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, it has not been used until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nBut referee Chris Kavanagh will have been wishing he had VAR to fall back on at Villa Park after an offside opener for the hosts, a blatant penalty for the visitors not awarded, plus at least three other controversial decisions that could have affected the outcome.\n\nUltimately, Newcastle - who were on the wrong end of the majority of the calls - progressed into the last 16, but manager Eddie Howe couldn't hide his disappointment with the officials.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener for Villa was offside, Lucas Digne's second-half handball should have been given as a penalty rather than a free-kick outside the box, while the French full-back was also fortunate to escape a red card for a reckless challenge on Jacob Murphy.\n\nHowe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision-making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold.\n\n\"When VAR is there, there is a tendency to think, 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'. Then your decision-making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there.\n\n\"I'm always torn on VAR because I love the raw emotion when a goal goes in and you don't see a flag or hear a whistle and you know the goal is going to stand and nobody can take it away from you. But, on the other side of that, I was wishing there was VAR for the goal they scored against us - and probably throughout the entire game.\"\n\nVilla, themselves, will be reflecting on a straight red card for goalkeeper Marco Bizot in first-half added time when they were leading 1-0, and could argue Dan Burn was offside for the visitors' equaliser through Sandro Tonali.\n\nBoss Unai Emery, added: \"Today it makes sense understanding that VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees.\"\n\nAfter a season so far, which has seen VAR the talking point on a weekly basis, has a weekend without it shown the potential problems?\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"For five or six months, they have been relying on VAR and they come into this situation and it all changes.\n\n\"In their defence, which is hard for me, they have VAR for five to six months, then come into a huge game without it, so it is difficult for them.\n\n\"I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it.\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think today is a great example of that. These guys look petrified to make a decision today because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\"\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nTonali double helps Newcastle fight back for win at Villa\n\nAfter watching the replays, Abraham's goal should clearly have been ruled out for offside, but it was the Digne non-penalty decision that really left most speechless.\n\nThe Villa full-back was at least a yard inside the penalty area when he was penalised for a handball, but incredibly Kavanagh awarded a free-kick - from which Tonali eventually scored the 63rd-minute equaliser.\n\nFormer England striker Wayne Rooney told Match of the Day Live: \"That decision is one of the worst decisions I have ever seen in football because at no stage was Digne out of the penalty box.\n\n\"He is three or four yards inside. The linesman is just in front of it and you can clearly see how much he is in the penalty box.\n\n\"The referee looked like he blew and looked like he was listening to someone in his ear, so I'm assuming the linesman gave the decision, and it's absolute shocker.\"\n\nAnd former Newcastle forward Shearer added: \"There is perhaps a small excuse for the referee to not see this, but I am being kind to him.\n\n\"But there is no excuse whatsoever for the assistant, who is 10-15 yards away, Nick Greenhalgh, who had a nightmare today.\n\n\"I don't think that is a difficult decision at all. In fact, it is easy. At this standard, that has to be given. There is no excuse for the assistant to not tell the referee that he has got that totally wrong.\"\n\nA marginal VAR offside decision caused a fair amount of controversy for Newcastle in midweek. Joe Willock had a goal disallowed at Tottenham when the semi-automated technology said his forehead was offside.\n\nAbraham's goal was the kind of decision the video review was brought in for - the real howlers.\n\nThe Villa striker was clearly ahead of the defence when Douglas Luiz played the free-kick. With VAR, the goal would have been ruled out.\n\nIt would be easy to blame switching between systems as a defence for the assistant, Nick Greenhalgh. But with or without VAR, he would be expected to raise his flag if he's identified an offside.\n\nShould Digne have been sent off?\n\nWould the VAR have stepped in to show a red card to Digne for serious foul play with his late challenge on Jacob Murphy? It is far from certain from what we have seen in the Premier League.\n\nWe often hear the VAR has referenced glancing contact to uphold the decison of a yellow card. See Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby last month.\n\nDigne did come in at some speed and that would have increased the chance of being sent off on review.\n\nYet the Frenchman did not push through on to the shin of the Newcastle player. That his foot came off quickly probably would have saved him.\n\nIt may well have been one of those where the on-field decision would have stood, whether it was yellow or red card.\n\nSerious foul play or denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity (Dogso)?\n\nReally, this incident could have been either. After all, Bizot brought down Murphy with a knee-high challenge - although it was not with studs leading.\n\nWhen the Dutch goalkeeper fouled the Newcastle forward, the Magpies were left with three attackers up against only Luiz, although Dogso could only be applied to the player fouled.\n\nThe VAR would have taken into account the general run of the ball was not towards goal. They would also consider if Luiz would have been able to get across to prevent the shot.\n\nYou can make a case for a degree of doubt for Dogso. But much like the Digne decision it is one which would likely have stayed with the on-field decision.\n\nDid Digne handle in the penalty area?\n\nIt is hard to understand just how referee Chris Kavanagh and his assistant managed to give a free-kick.\n\nAt no point was Digne outside the penalty area.\n\nNot before Kieran Trippier played the cross or at the moment the Villa player raised his arms and committed the handball. Even after the offence he continued walking in the box.\n\nThe VAR would have needed seconds to correct the free-kick to a penalty.\n\nWas Burn offside for equaliser?\n\nFrom the resulting free-kick Newcastle did score anyway through Tonali, but with VAR in use, it could have been disallowed.\n\nWhen Trippier floated in the free-kick, defender Burn ran across the front of the Villa defence. It looked like the England international may well have been marginally offside.\n\nWhile Burn did not touch the ball, he both pushed down on Abraham and jumped in front of substitute goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.\n\nIt would have been close but if the semi-automated technology found the Newcastle player was offside, the goal would have been ruled out.",

    "fullText": "Harry Brook's laugh as he began his post-match press conference said plenty.\n\n\"We haven't quite made it as easy as we would have liked so far,\" the relieved England captain said.\n\nAfter three games at this T20 World Cup, England have escaped against Nepal, been thrashed by West Indies and now come through a nervy win against Scotland.\n\nBeat Italy on Monday and they will be through to the Super 8s.\n\nFrom there, two wins from three, one of which could be against Zimbabwe, would be enough to reach a World Cup semi-final. Reach that point and anything can happen, or so they say.\n\nEngland edge to victory to leave Scotland on brink\n\nTucker's 94 keeps Ireland's World Cup hopes alive\n\nEngland have, of course, also been here before.\n\nThey have won three World Cups, two in the 20-over format and the 50-over competition in 2019, and on each occasion they lost at least once before going on to lift the trophy.\n\nAcross the nine previous men's T20 World Cups, only once, India last time around in 2024, has a team gone through the tournament unbeaten.\n\nA defeat at this stage, or an unconvincing performance like the one put in on Saturday in Kolkata, does not decide the eventual outcome.\n\nIndia were 77-6 against the United States, Australia were beaten by Zimbabwe and the much-fancied South Africa almost chucked away a winning position against Afghanistan in a tournament that has been more competitive from the start than any of its previous iterations.\n\nBut that does not mean poor performances can simply be ignored.\n\nYes, reach your peak at the right time.\n\nYou still have to show you are capable of reaching the top when tackling the foothills.\n\nOpener Phil Salt said on Friday \"nobody can live with\" England when \"we are at our best\" but they remain a long way from it.\n\nThis five-wicket victory margin, sealed with 10 balls to spare, suggested a more comfortable afternoon than England had in reality.\n\nAgain there was jeopardy - Jos Buttler failing to reach 40 for the eighth time for England this year, Salt offering too much famine amid the feast, an uncertainty among batters when the ball moves and, most worryingly, another refusal to learn while the game is in its flow.\n\nEight of Scotland's 10 wickets fell as batters attempted to sweep, pull or heave the ball into the leg side. Having watched that, Jacob Bethell, Brook and Sam Curran took it upon themselves to ensure more catching practice was offered.\n\nIt is no surprise Tom Banton, who missed with a sweep early on and then put the shot away entirely, went on to be England's highest scorer and match-winner.\n\nBanton's knock was a breakthrough moment for a batter who, having been handed a debut aged 20 in 2019, had only made four fifties across his 36 previous innings.\n\nHere he looked far more mature than he did back on that tour of New Zealand, or the home summer that followed and his success pushes away any doubts over the make-up of the top order.\n\nBen Duckett's route into the XI appears to have been blocked.\n\nThere have been other positives for England over the past week in India.\n\nJofra Archer was more threatening, more accurate, against Scotland after conceding 90 runs combined against Nepal and West Indies.\n\nHaving rehired fielding coach Carl Hopkinson after the whoopsies spread through the squad during the Ashes, England's catching has also been immaculate and Curran, this dismissal aside, has proven dependable in crucial moments.\n\nBut still England are clinging to the hope that something will eventually click, that something will simply fall into place and provide them with their first complete performance of the competition.\n\nIt may come - possibly, should they beat Italy, on a flight back to the comfort of Sri Lanka where they won 3-0 before this trip - but right now England do not seem entirely clear where to look.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Brook, asked why his side have not found their groove. \"Things haven't seemed to have clicked so far yet.\"\n\nBrook was part of England's squads at the 2022 and 2024 World Cups, which both began badly before turning in differing directions.\n\nIn 2022, England lost to Ireland but responded by comprehensively beating a New Zealand side that just thrashed hosts Australia by 89 runs.\n\nEngland need a similar performance soon to reboot their tournament because right now it feels more akin to their efforts in 2024, when their only wins came against Oman, Namibia, the United States and West Indies.\n\nEngland reached the semi-finals on that trip around the Caribbean but were beaten each time they faced the real contenders - Australia, South Africa and India.\n\nIn truth, the spark from England's white-ball sides has been absent going back much further, ever since that night in Melbourne in November 2022.\n\nIt was absent at the 2023 World Cup, in the Caribbean in 2024 and at the Champions Trophy in Pakistan last year when the hiring of Brendon McCullum as white-ball coach failed to raise them from their slump and they left without winning a match.\n\nBrook says it is the \"belief\" in the squad that makes him confident this tournament would be more like 2022 than 2024.\n\n\"We've been in this situation before where we have lost a game early and World Cups aren't always smooth sailing,\" he said.\n\nOutside of the dressing room, that belief is waning.\n\nIf Brook cannot find it then coach McCullum must because an underwhelming run to the semi-finals did not save former coach Matthew Mott his job in 2024.\n\nSalt thinks England can beat anyone on their day and it is time for them to pinpoint a date in the calendar.\n\nMost of sport's successful teams have had an arrogant streak. Crucially, though, it needs to be earned.\n\nThe Scotland win ensured they remain alive but England have no chance of winning this World Cup if they do not improve.",

    "description": "Scotland were at their wildly entertaining best in the Calcutta Cup win over England. This was their perfect day, writes Tom English.",
    "fullText": "Standing pitchside in the aftermath of Scotland's bazooka proving too much for England's pop gun, Sione Tuipulotu, a captain stepping back from the abyss, spoke of the trauma that his players went through after the debacle in Rome a week ago. A week which now feels like a year.\n\nNow, in a happier place, he could never remember hurting after a game like he hurt after Italy last weekend. He \"internalised the pain\" of that defeat. Then he let it loose on England.\n\nTuipulotu made his point like a man who had been through therapy. In the mind's eye you could imagine him stretched out on a couch with the sound of gently lapping water playing in his ears. Better that than listening to the torrents of stick about his team and the wounding chat about his head coach.\n\nGregor Townsend watched what he said, later on.\n\nMaybe part of him wanted to vent at all the doubters, which was just about everybody outside his bubble. He didn't go there.\n\nMaybe there was an urge to gloat after the 31-20 triumph, but he resisted.\n\nTownsend was stony-faced. No smile, no jocularity, no sense that he had just won a major victory. If you didn't know better you'd swear he was the losing coach, not the renaissance man.\n\nHe didn't articulate it, but this has been a savagely bruising week for him. He now has redemption, for a week. He has all the evidence he needs that his team, on their best days, when their sense of outrage and vengeance is high, can be truly outstanding.\n\nGetting themselves to fever pitch when there's cordite in the air is one thing. Getting there when all you can smell are roses is quite another.\n\nHaving used that terrible experience of Rome as fuel for Murrayfield, what will get them to the dark place - as the prop Pierre Schoeman might put it - before Wales in Cardiff on Saturday?\n\nThat's the next Test, the next must-win.\n\nScotland delivered for Townsend - Tuipulotu\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win\n\nScotland travel to Cardiff as hot favourites, but without three players from the Calcutta Cup. Victory has come at a cost.\n\nJack Dempsey, belligerence on legs, Jamie Ritchie, a warrior in his 40 minutes, and Jamie Dobie, class in every area after a rough experience in Rome, are not going to make it to Wales.\n\nDempsey and Ritchie might not be seen again in the championship.\n\nTownsend could have done without those blows, but he's used to the carnage of Six Nations rugby. He also has decent deputies in store for the trip to the Principality Stadium.\n\nOne win must become two or else the significance of what happened at Murrayfield goes away like so many of the other victories over England. Unless it's properly built upon then it's a one-off and everybody connected with this team is fed up with one-offs.\n\nAll the self-doubt Scotland owned now transfers to England. It's a heavy burden. It's said, endlessly, that Scotland get up for England more than they get up for any other opposition. We can debate the accuracy of that until the cows come home.\n\nThe relevant question about this England team, and the ones that have come before them in a run of five defeats in six against the Scots is why don't they get up for Scotland?\n\nThe dawning of reality should be close at hand now for England players - 'maybe it's not you, Scotland, maybe it's us'.\n\nTuipulotu said on Friday his team were desperate and he wanted to see that desperation visited upon England. He got his wish.\n\nWe know Scotland had this kind of performance deep within them - there's been plenty, if fleeting, evidence of their class - but what we didn't know, what we could not take on trust, was their ability to deliver this kind of controlled fury for 80 minutes.\n\nBut they did. This was as dominant a Scotland performance as you'll get over England, a thing of thunder and beauty, class and heart, ruthlessness and intelligence. All those combined Calcutta Cup teams that people did pre-match - Scotland had an average of three or four players in a joint side - were ripped to shreds. A new version would have more tartan than a shortbread factory.\n\nIt was a game that threw up dozens of cameos to ponder, not just the creation and execution of the Scotland tries but the bare-knuckle stuff they delivered in defence. To a man, starting team and bench, they stood up.\n\nStood up for themselves, for their coach, for their supporters.\n\nWith each demonic play in defence during that second half you got a snapshot of how difficult this past week has been for them and how they were prepared to do anything - anything - to make it better.\n\nScotland Rugby Podcast: Impressive Scotland regain Calcutta Cup\n\nThere was a surreal moment on a storied day, not Matt Fagerson's charge-down of George Ford's late ill-fated drop goal nor the offload to Jones, nor the way Jones ate up road on the way to scoring his second of the day and his eight in eight Calcutta Cups.\n\nIt wasn't the fact Scotland had now secured a bonus point in a game they were supposed to lose or that they were 18 points clear of a heavily fancied England, as trippy as that was.\n\nNo. What was unusual was the lack of weakness out there in the middle and up there in the stands, the total absence of Scottish wobbles and Scottish fatalism, which can be a local speciality at times.\n\nWatching this team lose, or threaten to lose, big leads in games in recent seasons breeds a certain worry. The mental implosions, the victories left behind them.\n\nThere was none of that this time. Even as England came piling forward, the old familiar fretfulness didn't exist. You knew, as much as you could possibly know, that Scotland were winning this. That feeling of near certainty - it was an odd feeling.\n\nEngland had their moments when chasing, but Scotland met each and every one head on. It was raw and it was special. Ambitious rugby is in the DNA of this team. How could it not be when Finn Russell, utterly brilliant, is its creative heartbeat?\n\nAgainst England, it was married with fire. Scotland haven't always got the balance right - too much rugby and not enough dog - but it was inch-perfect on Saturday. Riotously so.\n\nThe psychology of this team is something that would make Sigmund Freud swoon. Gloriously unpredictable and, at times, impossible to read, they are wildly entertaining - bewildering, bewitching, brilliant. This was their perfect day.\n\nRugby Union Weekly: How the Scotland squad 'did it for Gregor'\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nAuld enemy, new talent - Scotland & England's scrap for tomorrow's stars\n\nWhat are all the trophies teams can win in the Six Nations?",

    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott has been one of the most generous philanthropists during the past few years, and an episode in college may help explain why.\n\nAfter finalizing her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, Scott ended up with a load of shares she earned from helping to build the e-commerce giant during its early days, when she helped with business plans and contracts. Upon their divorce, Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon, or about 139 million shares at the time.\n\nSince 2020, Scott has reduced her stake by 42%, selling or donating about 58 million shares. The philanthropist is still worth nearly $28 billion today, despite having donated $26 billion through her philanthropic platform Yield Giving, which she founded in 2022. Yield Giving has donated to thousands of organizations, focused on issues including DEI, education, disaster recovery, and more.\n\nThis fall alone, she donated well over $400 million to several education- and DEI-focused organizations, many of which received the largest gifts in their respective histories.\n\nScott sees the value of and need for support, especially during someone’s early, formative years. After all, she had to borrow money from her college roommate when she was struggling.\n\n“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote of giving in an Oct. 15 essay published to her Yield Giving site. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?\n\n“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college. It was the college roommate who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.”\n\nAfter graduating from Princeton University, Scott went on to become a talented novelist—a product of none other than Toni Morrison’s teaching. And in 2005, Scott published her debut novel, The Testing of Luther Albright, which won an American Book Award in 2006. Morrison reviewed the book as “a rarity: a sophisticated novel that breaks and swells the heart.”\n\nHer roommate from Princeton saw the difference that the $1,000 gift had made in her life, and that inspired her roommate to start a company 20 years later that offers loans to low-income students without a cosigner.\n\nThat roommate was Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, who went on to found Funding U, which has provided $80 million in low-interest loans to about 8,000 students who needed help to pay for college, according to Princeton. Tarkenton still plays it cool, though, when asked about how she changed Scott’s life.",

    "description": "\"I don't,\" the South Carolina senator said at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference",
    "fullText": "Lindsey Graham offered a blunt and dismissive message to Europeans worried about Donald Trump's vocal plans to take over Greenland\n\n“Who gives a s--- who owns Greenland? I don’t,” the South Carolina senator said at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference\n\nGraham's message comes amid Trump's quest for full “ownership” of Greenland, which has strained U.S. relations with NATO allies\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham dismissed worries about President Donald Trump's quest for full “ownership” of Greenland, including threats to acquire it by force.\n\nGraham's blunt message came at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference on Friday, Feb. 13, after journalist Jonathan Martin asked the South Carolina Republican, 70, if he has a message for Europeans in the audience “who are obviously nervous” about Trump’s controversial plans for the NATO territory.\n\nGraham, a Trump ally, first joked about Martin’s question. “Well, if you're nervous, have a beer,” he said. “Go see a doctor. Stop being nervous.”\n\nGraham then downplayed the president’s bid to take over the territory, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark — and which has stressed the United States’ relations with Denmark and other NATO allies.\n\nSharing his actual message to “my European friends,” Graham said, “Greenland is behind us, but the goal is to get outcomes.”\n\n“Who gives a s--- who owns Greenland? I don’t,” the senator continued. “So the point is Greenland is going to be more fortified because Donald Trump, once he feels like it’s his brand or his buy-in, is going to go big.”\n\nWhen he was questioned about Denmark’s relationship with the U.S. amid Trump’s vocal plans to seize control of Greenland, Graham said, “I think we’re good.”\n\n“I think everybody is hugging it out and, you know, we’ll live to fight another day,” he added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nTrump previously linked his loss of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to his desire to seize control of Greenland in a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.\n\nIn his January letter to Støre, Trump urged the politician to give the U.S. “Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” despite the fact that Støre was not responsible for Trump's Nobel loss, nor does he control the fate of Greenland.\n\n\"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,\" Trump wrote in the letter.\n\nHe later doubled down on his Greenland plans in a Truth Social post the same day, writing, \"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!! President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nIn a January interview with The New York Times, Trump said his desire to have ownership of Greenland is \"psychologically important” to him.\n\nStill, reporters questioned why he wouldn't just send more American troops to Greenland if his goal was, as he previously stated, to fend off foreign threats from China and Russia.\n\nAfter Trump told the outlet that ownership of the NATO territory is “what I feel is psychologically needed for success,” the Times' White House correspondent Katie Rogers — whom Trump recently called \"ugly, both inside and out\" for writing a story about his age — asked him to clarify, \"Psychologically important to you or to the United States?\"\n\n“Psychologically important for me,\" Trump replied to Rogers. \"Now, maybe another president would feel differently, but so far I’ve been right about everything.\"",

    "fullText": "This is a developing story. ABC4 will update this post as more information becomes available.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — A 3.5 magnitude earthquake hit northwest of West Valley City and many people across the Wasatch Front felt it.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, a 3.6 km earthquake struck north-west of West Valley City. The earthquake’s epicenter was around 8.3km deep and occurred around 6:32 p.m.\n\nABC4 acquired video footage of the earthquake from some who felt it and from our own station. Below is our tower camera, which shook quite a bit during the quake.\n\nA Utah resident captured the earthquake on his camera, taken near 1800 S Redwood Road\n\nDid you get footage of the earthquake? You can email us at news@abc4.com for a chance to be featured.\n\nWhile it is difficult to prepare for earthquakes ahead of time, it is important to stay aware of what to do if one occurs.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention states that you should immediately drop down onto your hands and knees, cover your head and neck underneath a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on to your shelter.\n\nIf you cannot drop to the ground or get underneath a shelter, the CDC recommends that you sit down or remain seated. You should find something to protect your head and neck, such as a large book, a pillow, or your arms.\n\nIf you’re outside when the earthquake starts, it’s best to go to an open area away from trees, telephone poles and buildings. However, if you’re inside during an earthquake, you should stay inside.\n\nOnce the initial earthquake is over, there still may be aftershocks. The CDC says you should avoid taking elevators, because the power could go out. Gas lines or water lines could also burst, leading to potential hazards.\n\nIf you are a shoreline following an earthquake, you should immediately head to higher ground and move inland, as the earthquake may have generated a tsunami.\n\nIt’s possible that there will be fallen debris and other hazards in the area, so the CDC says you may need to travel on foot. If you’re in a moving vehicle, they recommend stopping as quickly and safely as possible and set the parking brake. If a downed power line falls on the car, you should stay inside until a trained individual removes the wire.\n\nYou can learn more about earthquake safety here.\n\nThis is a developing story. ABC4 will update this post as more information becomes available.\n\n‘One moment can change everything’: Family mourns the loss of man who died in Eagle Mountain crash on Wednesday\n\n2 arrested after K-9 sniffs out $300,000 worth of drugs during Blanding traffic stop\n\nOlympic athlete couples celebrate Valentine’s Day in Milan\n\nMore conflict in curling as Canadian women are accused of the same violation as men\n\nNations League draw: Spain, England and Croatia in same group",
