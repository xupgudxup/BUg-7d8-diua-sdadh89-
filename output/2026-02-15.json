    "fullText": "If the idea is to be in top form by the start of the season, Nashville SC would have some soul-searching to do.\n\nBut after a 2-1 loss to Lexington SC in its final preseason game on Feb. 14 at Geodis Park, coach B.J. Callaghan didn't seem overly worried with the result.\n\nNashville mostly dominated possession against Lexington, a team from the second-division USL Championship, but gave up a pair of goals on unforced errors. In the 42nd minute, goalkeeper Xavier Valdez failed to control a routine back-pass and gave up the ball directly to a Lexington forward, and with 10 minutes to play, Nashville turned the ball over once more, leading to Lexington's game-winning goal.\n\n\"Mistakes are always going to happen,\" Callaghan said. \"We're more concerned with how we respond from mistakes. I thought the group, as a whole, responded fairly well and went right back and continued to look like us.\"\n\nNashville scored its lone goal in the 55th minute off a bad pass by Lexington's goalkeeper. Hany Mukhtar intercepted the pass and assisted Cristian Espinoza, who fired it home from close range.\n\n\"In the first half, I thought we were too slow with the ball and didn't move it well and missed the opportunities and openings that were there,\" Callaghan said. \"In the second half, the tempo was better, the intensity was better. Overall, it's probably a good performance in the way of some of the things that we've been working on. But at the end of the day, I think guys probably still need to step up and perform at a higher level.\"\n\nMORE: Nashville SC signs Eddi Tagseth to contract extension through 2027\n\nNashville finished the preseason with two wins, two losses and one draw in five games and was outscored 9-8. Its first competitive game is on Feb. 17 at Atletico Ottawa in the first round of the CONCACAF Champions Cup, and it hosts the New England Revolution on Feb. 21 to start MLS play.\n\nNashville began with what appeared to be a full-strength lineup, with Mukhtar, Espinoza and Sam Surridge in attack, Eddi Tagseth and Patrick Yazbek in midfield and Dan Lovitz, Maxwell Woledzi, Jeisson Palacios and Andy Najar on defense. Outside of Valdez and Ahmed Qasem, who were replaced by Joe Willis and Shak Mohammed, respectively, at halftime, Nashville's starters played most of the match.\n\n\"The main exercise was to get the next group 75 minutes into their legs, so that going into Ottawa, every single player is ready to go a full 90 if needed,\" Callaghan said.\n\nJacob Shames can be reached by email at jshames@gannett.com and on X/Twitter @Jacob_Shames.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: BJ Callaghan, Nashville SC not worried about loss to end preseason",

    "description": "The Brooklyn Nets moved up to 26th in NBA.com's power rankings heading into the All-Star Break.",
    "fullText": "The Brooklyn Nets have not been playing the way they were hoping for since the calendar turned to January, but the good news is that the All-Star Break should serve as a reset of sorts. Brooklyn dealt with some injuries heading into the All-Star Break, specifically to forward Michael Porter Jr., but the Nets are slightly moving up in the power rankings prior to the Break.\n\n\"The Nets held onto Michael Porter Jr. at the deadline, a possible indication that they intend to be competitive in the 2026-27 season (with no control of their ’27 first-round pick),\" John Schuhmann wrote for NBA.com. Schuhmann ranked the Nets 26th in his latest power rankings pointing to the fact that Brooklyn is still regarded as one of the worst teams in the league despite the fact that they didn't trade Porter away.\n\n\"They added some second-rounders by helping teams duck the luxury tax and decided that Cam Thomas would be one of the players they waived to create the requisite roster space,\" Schuhmann continued on his view of what Brooklyn did at the deadline before noting how the Nets are committing to playing the rookies more. \"Brooklyn now ranks second (behind Charlotte) in the percentage of its minutes (29%) that have come from rookies.\"\n\nWhen Schuhmann wrote this version of his power rankings, the Nets had not yet played the Chicago Bulls or Indiana Pacers at home prior to the All-Star Break coming around. Brooklyn was able to beat the Bulls 123-115 on Feb. 9, but the Nets dropped the ball against the Pacers on Feb. 11 as they lost 115-110 despite leading by as many as 18 points in the contest.\n\nUltimately, the Nets have 29 games left to play for the rest of the season and with all of the talk surrounding the Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards when it comes to tanking, Brooklyn seems to be sticking to their usual rotation when those players are healthy. However, with the Nets having the fifth-worst record in the NBA heading into All-Star Break, it will be interesting to see if the team gravitates towards playing the younger players more down the stretch.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: Nets rank 26th in NBA.com power rankings heading into All-Star Break",

    "description": "Team USA's dominant start to the Olympics in Game 1 turned into a closer-than-expected victory over Denmark in Game 2. Their chances of clinching the top overall seed took a hit, but they dealt with some adversity effectively.",
    "fullText": "The USA's men's Olympic hockey team couldn't have asked for a better first game, but they certainly could have for their second.\n\nWhen they took out Team Latvia on Thursday, they were firing on all pistons, with five players recording two points. And star goalie Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets was nearly perfect for the Americans, which looked like the dominant force many believed they'd be at the Games.\n\nThe Americans got a reality check on Saturday courtesy of Team Denmark, which put up a fight for much of the game before the States pulled away and won 6-3.\n\nSubpar goaltending from Jeremy Swayman and an offense against a team the United States were expected to blow out could have made their next two games more difficult than they needed to be. That said, the wakeup call could help them adjust and come out stronger.\n\nThe result turned out to be in Team USA's favor, with the Americans outshooting Denmark 47-21. But it was not nearly as one-sided as the score or shot count might suggest.\n\nThe Danes took the first two leads of the game, less than two minutes into the first period and again midway through the first. Nobody had that on their bingo card. And although the Americans wound up flexing their muscles by scoring three times in a 7:57 span during the second period, the game on the whole was far closer than the U.S. would've preferred.\n\nMen's #Olympics standings after day 4.🏒 #IIHF pic.twitter.com/xq3tB3ZSzb\n\n— IIHF (@IIHFHockey) February 14, 2026\n\nTeam USA now has a goal differential of plus-7 in Group C play. That's not as good as Canada's goal differential of plus-9 in Group A after two games, but if the Americans can maul Team Germany in their final round-robin game on Sunday, and if Canada has a low-scoring game against France that same day, it's still possible the U.S. locks up the No. 1 seed.\n\nAnd conversely, it's still possible that the States wobble and wind up behind the powerhouse Canadians and end up with a less favorable quarterfinal matchup.\n\nBut one thing is clear: Swayman has probably played his final game in these Olympics.\n\nFirst of all, the Boston Bruins veteran goalie gave up a goal to Danish defenseman Nicholas B. Jensen that was shot from center ice. He told reporters post-game he didn't see the puck and that it was a flash screen.\n\n\"It was just the perfect height, right between the stands and board level,\" he said. \"I truly lost it… No matter how they go in, you have to step up and stop the next one.\"\n\nAs the crowd in Italy gasped at Swayman's miscue, Jensen's goal gave Team Denmark a 2-1 lead.\n\nThen, with three seconds left in the second period, after the U.S. scored three unanswered goals, Denmark defenseman Phillip Bruggisser took a slapshot from the top of the zone that beat Swayman as well. It's possible J.T. Miller screened him when he went for the block, but shots from low-danger areas like that should be fairly routine stops.\n\nMaple Leafs' Matthews, Jets' Hellebuyck Must Lead Team USA To No. 1 Seed Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews and Jets goalie Connor Hellebuyck starred in Team USA's first win. They'll need to keep it up when they play to build a large enough goal differential to clinch the No. 1 overall seed over Canada.\n\nTeam Denmark's scoring showed the Americans how much tightening up they need to do before the stakes of the Games get significantly higher.\n\nThat almost certainly means Hellebuyck will be the go-to netminder for the U.S. until further notice, although that was probably the plan anyway. After tomorrow, there aren't any back-to-back games for Team USA, which clinched Group C with the win.\n\nThat doesn't mean the road ahead for Team America will be easier. It could turn out to be considerably tougher, with a possible showdown against Team Sweden in the cards if the U.S. are the No. 2 seed and if the Swedes win their qualifying match.\n\nThe good vibes of the Americans' first game quickly evaporated in Game 2 against the Danes. In the end, the result went their way, but if their first game unfolded like a pleasant dream, their second game was a cold wakeup call that they have to show urgency against any team, no matter how their opponents look on paper.\n\nDon't get it twisted – the Americans still have a lot to like about their Olympics thus far. And the brief stretch of adversity they faced on Saturday may be exactly what they need to thrive when the games matter most. No team has a flawless road to a gold medal performance, and Team USA learned against Denmark that you need to put in the work and earn every 'W' that puts you any closer to the Olympic podium.\n\nFighting your way through rough spots – and emerging stronger on the other side of it – is the hallmark of every champion. We'll see how the U.S. reacts to this close call, but for now, at least, their destiny is very much in their hands.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "The Brazilian Women's Under-20 Team has already turned the page and began preparations for the next phase of the South American Championship in Paraguay this Saturday (14). After the classic match against Argentina, the coaching staff led a session focused on fine-tuning, with an emphasis on details that can be decisive in games. According to coach Camila, the team approaches each commitment as a decision, and the work from now on will be directed towards raising the level in all aspects of the game.\n\n\"From now on, the focus is entirely on the details. That's how you play a final. You play to win, and you win in whatever way possible, whether it's technically, tactically, physically, mentally, or with grit. We will work on these details to place each game within this final structure and give our best game by game,\" she emphasized.\n\nThe session held a day after the match against Argentina aimed primarily at adjusting the offensive performance, especially in the final third of the field. Despite the good volume of play presented, the staff identified points to be adjusted.\n\n\"The focus was on the details. We had a very high volume of finishing and reaching the final third. So we worked on the final pass and finishing, which are fine-tuning adjustments at this moment. Our offensive volume was very good, and we also worked on the reaction after losing possession and defensive balance. These are details we will continue to adjust,\" she explained.\n\nAnother factor that has required special attention from the coaching staff is the intense heat in Paraguay. The high temperatures directly influence the training planning and load management. Additionally, the staff sought to balance the players' playing time during the first phase, ensuring that the squad is physically prepared for the decisive sequence of the tournament.\n\n\"We faced a very hot preparation here in Paraguay, a different heat than what we were used to. We had to pay a lot of attention to hydration, load management, and also the exposure time of the athletes to the sun. It was a work built together with the health and performance unit to ensure they reach this second stage with less wear and in the best conditions,\" Camila stated.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Every starting quarterback from the 2025 season was ranked. So where did the Indianapolis Colts' three starters land?",
    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts had three different quarterbacks start games this past season. So, where did each of them land in NFL.com's starting quarterback rankings?\n\nNick Shook recently ranked all 63 quarterbacks who made a start last season. Based on their play in the regular season and playoffs, he then listed those quarterbacks from 1 to 63, placing them in tiers.\n\nMaking a big jump and landing in Tier 2 was Daniel Jones. For more on Jones' ranking and why Shook placed him there, you can find that here.\n\nBut what about Phillip Rivers and Riley Leonard?\n\nRivers came in at No. 36 and in Tier 5. A few others in this category included Kyler Murray, Joe Flacco, Spencer Rattler, and others.\n\n\"The 44-year-old proved he could still succeed with his brain; his arm, however, showed his age,\" Shook wrote.\n\nIn his three games, Rivers completed 63% of his passes for 544 yards with four touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\nThe Colts, unfortunately, did not win any of those games, but Rivers routinely put the offense into favorable looks pre-snap and helped that unit sustain drives and hang around in games, giving Indianapolis a chance.\n\nThe Colts needed stability at quarterback, and Rivers was able to provide that.\n\nLeonard, meanwhile, came in at No. 47 in these rankings and in Tier 6. Carson Wentz, Shedeur Sanders, Russell Wilson, and others were in this tier.\n\n\"Riley Leonard made one start and was shockingly effective, slinging the ball around the yard as if there was no tomorrow in a high-scoring loss to Houston,\" Shook wrote.\n\nAs Shook said, Leonard's start against Houston -- a very good defense -- in Week 18 was quite good. He completed 21-of-34 passes for 270 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nIt wasn't perfect by any means, but Leonard always found a way to respond. Could he be the Colts' backup quarterback in 2026?\n\nAnthony Richardson would appear in a couple of games before being placed on IR, but did not make any starts. So he did not qualify for Shook's rankings.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Every starting QB from 2025 ranked: Where do Colts QBs land?",

    "title": "Women's golf's big 2025 question is already getting answered in 2026",
    "description": "The 2025 season left the LPGA and women's golf with a conundrum.",
    "fullText": "Craig Kessler knew there was no easy answer, even if conventional wisdom said otherwise.\n\n“No silver bullets to creating stars,” the LPGA commissioner said at the CME Group Tour Championship in November.\n\nAt the end of a year defined by parity, the LPGA and women’s golf faced a conundrum as it looked to find its breakthrough moment: Is it better to have one or two superstars win and win a lot, or are parity and depth the answer?\n\nOne of Kessler’s top priorities as he took over as commissioner was to find a way to create and market his stars. The way, he said, was to identify those who connect with fans, are willing to show up outside the ropes to build their brand and whose play meets the necessary level.\n\n“You have the best players, you have the most marketable players, and you have the ones who are actually willing to lean in and do the work,” Kessler said. “It’s the handful of players at the center of that Venn diagram that we are going to invest our resources against in order to create global superstars and create that player and fan connection.”\n\nOf course, it’s no secret who the needles are in women’s golf at the moment. It’s the same two players who Kessler specifically mentioned by name as players who have done things outside of golf to raise their star profile: Nelly Korda and Charley Hull.\n\nWhile the outside-the-ropes stuff is important, Korda and Hull winning more, and doing so on the biggest stages in 2026, would be the most beneficial thing for the LPGA and women’s golf.\n\nKorda went winless in 2025 after her seven-win 2024. Hull won once, capturing the Kroger after World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul four-putted on the 72nd hole. It’s not a surprise that the two biggest moments of the 2025 season were Korda’s Sunday charge at the U.S. Women’s Open and Hull’s final-round flurry at the AIG Women’s Open, both of which came up just short.\n\nA year in which Nelly and Charley win and win a lot would be the foundation for the climb toward a breakthrough that Kessler and all of the stakeholders in women’s golf envision.\n\nThat’s what made the controversial start to the LPGA’s season so head-scratching. Korda shot a sterling 64 on Saturday in chilly temperatures in Orlando to grab the lead. Everything was set up for the ideal Sunday, with the LPGA’s marquee star looking to snap a winless drought to open the 2026 season. But the decision to shorten the tournament to 54 holes due to the cold conditions meant Korda won the tournament on the driving range and won’t hit another shot for a month.\n\nKessler apologized for the way the decision was handled and communicated. He vowed to learn from it. There’s no doubt the controversial shortening overshadowed what could have been the ideal scenario for the LPGA’s opening weekend.\n\nBut Korda did still win. When she tees it up again, talk of a drought will be over, and she’ll be eyeing win No. 2 on the season.\n\n“I did a lot of good last year,” Korda said after her 54-hole win. “Just kind of wasn’t going my way. I guess I was just so focused on being really present, which I told myself to do that last year, too. Maybe the outside noise did make its way in a little bit more than I wanted to. I learned a lot.\n\n“Just very happy to get the first win of the year, and hopefully that leads into a great year.”\n\nAnd on Saturday, women’s golf’s other needle mover fired a final-round 65 to storm back and win the PIF Saudi Ladies International on the Ladies European Tour.\n\nHull birdied six of the final eight holes at Riyadh Golf Club to nip Akie Iwai and Cassandra Alexander by one.\n\n“It feels great,” Hull said after securing the win. “Wow, it’s gone a bit too fast today. I was only two-under through nine holes and then I made a charge on the back nine. It was funny because last time I was around here my boyfriend said to me go out and make loads of birdies to begin with. He said to me last night, ‘Make loads of birdies coming in, you love chasing.’ And that’s what I did.”\n\nThe LPGA’s confounding decision to shorten the season-opening Tournament of Champions turned a Korda dream start into a question-filled debacle.\n\nBut on February 14, both Korda and Hull, the two biggest stars in women’s golf, have both won. Hull will tee it up again in two weeks at the HSBC Women’s World Championship, while Korda will return to action at the Fortinet Founders Cup in the middle of March.

    "title": "This mindset change made all the difference in Collin Morikawa's 62 at Pebble Beach",
    "description": "Collin Morikawa approached the third round of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am with a winning mindset",
    "fullText": "PEBBLE BEACH — Collin Morikawa sounds desperate to win again on the PGA Tour. On an increasingly blustery Saturday on the Monterey Peninsula, he gave himself a chance in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am with a largely flawless 10-under-par 62 at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Apparently, it’s all a state of mind.\n\nHaving just one victory since he captured the 2021 Open Championship, Morikawa is rather frustrated with his results, and you can’t blame him after he won two of the first eight majors in which he appeared and had five wins in less than three full seasons since he turned pro in 2019. But after a career-low effort at Pebble Beach born of some exceptional iron play, he has a chance to get back on the track he thinks he belongs.\n\n“The problem is the results matter sometimes, and for me in this world after the past year, three years, whatever you want to call it, I just haven't had the results I've wanted,” the California native said. “But I know I'm making the right strides, I know I'm inching towards the right direction. It's just I just haven't seen this momentum to be able to go out and play a low round.”\n\nHe had a lowest round on Saturday, and it was about as stress-free as you could want it. After beginning the third round eight shots behind co-leaders Akshay Bhatia and Ryo Hisatsune, Morikawa rattled off 11 birdies and climbed within two shots of Bhatia through 54 holes of this $20 million signature event. Morikawa, tied at 17-under 199 with Sepp Straka and Jake Knapp, hit all 18 greens in regulation and converted just 58 feet of putts—a metric that exemplifies just how dialed in he was on his approaches. He gained nearly nine strokes (8.885) in that discipline, best in the field.\n\n“Ball was going where I wanted, putts were dropping when I needed them. It was just never got ahead of myself,” said Morikawa, 29, who won the 2020 PGA Championship a few hours north of here at Harding Park in San Francisco. “This game is stressful enough, and I think I make it even more stressful for whatever reason. But I was able to just really take it a shot at a time and just enjoy the round when I could.”\n\nRanked 19th in the world, Morikawa won the 2023 ZOZO Championship in Japan, but in January that year he lost a six-shot lead to Jon Rahm at The Sentry at Kapalua, and at the end of 2021 he surrendered a five-stroke lead to Viktor Hovland at the Hero World Challenge. Those will give you scar tissue. Also an ulcer.\n\nWhen the task of winning is so difficult and chances so few, there isn’t a player on tour who doesn’t feel a gnawing exasperation with the game. But it’s more pronounced for a player like Morikawa who enjoyed tremendous early success. He hasn’t had a top-10 finish since a T-8 at the Rocket Classic in June. He began this year missing the cut at the Sony Open in Hawaii and was T-54 at last week’s WM Phoenix Open.\n\n“Look, I'm very hard on myself,” he admitted. “I think we all are, but I'm very, very hard. You ask anyone on my team, I can get down on myself pretty quickly because I know there's just really fine margins out here. And I want to go back not necessarily to the player I was, but just kind of use everything I've learned over the last six, seven years and just put that into the golfer I am today. It's very hard to do, it really is.”\n\nConversations with his mental coach, Rick Sensinghaus, recently have usually segued to things he might have been doing to stunt his own aspirations. On Friday, after shooting a 68 at Pebble that was filled with missed chances, Sensinghaus managed to instill in Morikawa a renewed sense of priorities.\n\n“He reminded me yesterday when I first came out and turned pro, I didn't care about honestly making cuts or top 20s; I came out to win,” Morikawa said. “When he told me that yesterday, there was that mindset switch going into today. I wanted to come out and win, win the weekend, win the tournament.\n\n“It's a small mindset adjustment and without him telling me that, who knows what I would have shot today. But I'm out here to win. I've got to set that mindset at the beginning of the day, at the beginning of the week and now I think we've given ourselves at least a chance come tomorrow.”",

The UA is 0-2 for the second year in a row after losing its opener 10-7 to Stanford on Friday.\n\nArizona scored four in the top of the 6th to take the lead, sending nine batters to the plate against OSU relievers after starter Ethan Kleinschmidt struck out eight over the first five frames. But when the UA turned to its pen in relief of Smith Bailey—who allowed two runs and three hits with four strikeouts and two walks over six innings—it was equally rough.\n\nUSF transfer Corey Kling retired only one of the four batters he faced, then freshman Benton Hickman hit the first two he faced before giving up the game-winning 2-run single and Tulane transfer allowed an RBI hit.\n\nArizona got the go-ahead run on in the top of the 9th after Tony Lira drove in Maddox Mihalakis with a single to get within one. But Andrew Cain and Nate Novitske followed with strikeouts to end it.\n\nThe UA struck out 18 times, this after recording 15 strikeouts against Stanford.\n\nLira was 3 for 5 while Mathis Meurant drove in two for the Wildcats, who will try to avoid a winless opening weekend Sunday at 4 p.m. MT against Michigan. Right-hander Collin McKinney will start for the UA.",

    "fullText": "Warriors get bad Haywood Highsmith buyout news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter missing out on Cam Thomas (he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks), Haywood Highsmith was among the next best available buyout targets for the Golden State Warriors.\n\nUnfortunately for the Dubs, the Phoenix Suns ensured that was no longer the case.\n\n“Free agent forward Haywood Highsmith has agreed to a multiyear deal with the Phoenix Suns,” ESPN’s Shams Charania reported Saturday.\n\n“Highsmith considered multiple playoff teams before reaching an agreement with the Suns on Saturday, sources said. Known as a gritty, two-way player when healthy, he joins a Phoenix team that is 32-23 at the All-Star break -- 1.5 games out of the 5th seed.”\n\nHighsmith could have been a beneficial role player with the Warriors this season. Sure, the former Philadelphia 76ers forward hasn’t played yet this year due to a knee injury and is undoubtedly a risky investment.\n\nHowever, with the Warriors having limited buyout options and Highsmith emerging as a useful two-way wing the past couple of seasons, there’s no question that Golden State missed out on the 29-year-old.\n\nDuring his last full NBA campaign (2024-25), the Wheeling product averaged 6.5 points and 3.4 rebounds per game with the Miami Heat, shooting 45.8% from the field and 38.2% from three-point land.\n\nAfter Charania’s report, the Warriors will have no choice but to direct their attention to different buyout targets.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers get good Walker Kessler trade news",

    "title": "Sunday Matters: Why you need to see the PGA Tour's Pebble Beach finale",
    "description": "The PGA Tour's first signature event of the season is coming to a close along one of golf's most picturesque backdrops.",
    "fullText": "The PGA Tour's first signature event of the 2026 season was already shaping up as tremendous theater. Now, the stage will also be an integral part of the production.\n\nAs wind and rain threaten the Monterey Peninsula on Sunday, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro‑Am will move up its final‑round start, turning the day into a battle not just among players, but against the elements and the clock.\n\nHere are the biggest storylines you need to know heading into the final round of play. Here's why Sunday matters:\n\nHold on to your hats, folks, and anything else you don't want to lose in the bay: Nastier weather is expected at Pebble Beach on Sunday, so tee times have been adjusted to beat the brunt of the storms.\n\nTee times have been adjusted to run from 7:22 to 9:45 a.m. local time, with threesomes starting off split tees.\n\nHow come? A broad area of low pressure is expected to move toward the Monterey Peninsula on Sunday, bringing showers that will increase in both coverage and intensity throughout the day. Conditions are expected to deteriorate further by evening, with rain transitioning to a steady, heavy downpour.\n\nWind may present the greater challenge. Sustained southerly winds of 15–25 mph, with gusts reaching up to 35 mph, are possible, particularly after 11 a.m.\n\nAfter going the first 45 holes without a bogey and building a healthy lead, Akshay Bhatia played some prevent defense on the back nine during Saturday's third round, and while he'll still have a two-stroke advantage to start the day on Sunday, he let the pack inch closer.\n\nThe two-time PGA Tour winner (2023 Barracuda Championship, 2024 Valero Texas Open) sits at 19 under and is gunning for the biggest victory of his professional career.\n\nBhatia closed the round as the prohibitive favorite with odds of +175 to win.\n\nNobody wanted to keep playing more on Saturday than Collin Morikawa, who finished with a scintillating 62, including birdies on five of the last six holes.\n\nBut Sepp Straka and Jake Knapp cruised along as well, and all three players sit at +470 to win heading into Sunday.\n\n\"Just understanding it's going to be a grind,\" Knapp said when asked what it will take on Sunday. \"It's not going to probably be pretty at all times. You're going to have some funky stuff happen and just have to deal with it. I think anytime you get bad elements and stuff like that you just have to do a good job of not letting it bug you. Just understand that you're probably going to make some bogeys. If it rains, probably going to get some weird water balls, so just kind of roll with it.\"\n\nThrough three rounds, Hideki Matsuyama has been the epitome of consistency with three straight rounds of 67. But sitting just four shots off the lead and without a ton of traffic above him on the leaderboard, it's absolutely plausible that the 33-year-old makes this event his 12th PGA Tour victory.\n\nHis +1900 odds to win sure look appealing with the weather likely to create chaos on Sunday.\n\nCan Scottie Scheffler, who has posted 17 top-10 finishes, climb from outside the top 20 at Pebble Beach and keep his streak alive?\n\nIt won't be easy. Although he fired a 67 in the third round, he sits in a tie for 22nd.\n\n\"I feel like I'm close to doing some good stuff,\" he said on Saturday. \"It's just around this place it's challenging in some spots. Like it's hard to tell how firm and how soft some of the greens have been. Most have been pretty soft, but there's a few, there's a shot I hit in today, it actually bounced forward with a wedge and I just couldn't figure out how it happened. Hit a couple where I just kind of misjudged how far the ball's going to come back.\"\n\nScheffler insists his streak doesn't matter to him, but it's certainly something he should be proud of. Billy Casper was the last player to make the top 10s in 17 tournaments in a row, but that streak ended in 1965.\n\n\"I mean, I think 17 straight top-10s is a good result from a lot of consistent play,\" Scheffler said. \"Outside of that, I could not care any less.\"\n\nOf course, with Scheffler's ability, anything can happen.\n\n\"I don't want to rule anything out for myself. You never want to limit yourself,\" he said. \"I'd obviously like to be in a better position on the leaderboard. But yeah, with crazy weather, crazy things can happen and we'll see what I can do (Sunday).\"\n\nPicking a signature hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links is sort of like trying to pick the most beautiful car in the Ferrari dealership.\n\nThe 18th, with waves splashing along its left side in Stillwater Cove, is the best finishing hole in golf. Jack Nicklaus has said the greatest second shot in golf is over the gorge on the majestic eighth hole. They're both stunners, but the seventh hole is like nothing else.\n\nWith golf courses being stretched and pulled to combat big hitters, the seventh, at about 100 yards, is a downhill test of nerves.\n\nIt might also be the most beautiful hole in golf, with waves crashing on the rock outcrop to the right, wispy grasses bobbing in the breeze on the hillside and Carmel Bay and Point Lobos State Natural Reserve in the distance. Seagulls and pelicans sail through the air above sailboats and luxury yachts anchored in the cove.\n\nIf you suffer from high blood pressure, hang out on the seventh at Pebble Beach for an hour and you'll be cured.\n\nWhile many, like Shane Lowry, had little trouble aiming at the stick on Saturday, the uptick in wind speed could present a tremendous change in how comfortable players are on the elevated tee.\n\nNot all PGA Tour courses are created equal, and this is a special week for the PGA Tour. The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am is contested on two of the top 10 courses the Tour plays each year, not counting major championships.\n\nPebble Beach Golf Links, as always, is the star of the AT&T broadcast. Perched above coves leading into the Pacific Ocean, the scenery is a welcome blast of sunshine for the legions of golf fans stuck somewhere in the cold. The course also ranks among the top 10 classic courses in the United States. Even most golfers who have never experienced Pebble Beach in person feel a connection forged by years of television coverage.\n\nWhich states have the most courses among the top 10 courses played by the PGA Tour? In all, California shows up on that list three times. In fact, California has the top three. Next up is Georgia with two top-10 Tour courses, and that’s not counting Augusta National and the Masters because the list looks only at regular events managed by the Tour – Augusta National operates the major championship on its own.\n\nThe scenery is breathtaking, but only a few homes dot the fairways at Pebble Beach. Even defending champion Rory McIlroy has a thing for some of the homes on the course. His favorite? It's on No. 10.\n\n\"I love that house at the back of the green,\" he said. \"It's like the prettiest house in the world.\"\n\nOur Adam Schupak took a look at some of the mansions of Pebble Beach and the celebrities who live in them.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Sunday Matters: Why you need to see PGA Tour's Pebble Beach finale",

    "description": "The former New York Giants head coach faced a backlash after discussing the intersection of child-rearing and football.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterbacks coach Joe Judge released a statement Saturday after a quote from a court appearance went viral, insisting that his comments about fathers of newborns prioritizing their sleep were \"taken out of context.\"\n\nThe comments were given Thursday during the hearing for Rebels quarterback Trinidad Chambliss' request for an injunction to play a sixth season of college football. That injunction was granted Friday.\n\nOne clip of Judge's testimony took off in particular, in which Judge recounts telling the partners of players with young children that they need to prevent those children from waking them up in the middle of the night.\n\nNEW: Ole Miss coach Joe Judge tells pregnant partners of players during the season that the father has to play good football.\n\n“He needs to be in another room, detached… he ain’t waking up for midnight feedings.” pic.twitter.com/LQG7t0fQtX\n\n— College Transfer Portal (@CollegeFBPortal) February 12, 2026\n\nNotably, that clip identifies Judge as an Ole Miss coach and refers to unspecified players, but what it does not mention is the conversation at the time was about Judge's experience dealing with sleep disorders while in NFL player development with the New England Patriots.\n\nIn his statement, Judge clarified that the conversations about playing football while raising a child were only in the NFL, never the collegiate level:\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so l'd like to provide some clarity. In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal.\"\n\nJudge worked under Bill Belichick from 2012 to 2019, became head coach of the New York Giants in 2020, then moved back to the Patriots after his firing in 2022. He joined Ole Miss in 2024 and currently holds the titles of quarterbacks coach and \"head coach of offense\" (John David Baker is the offensive coordinator under head coach Pete Golding).\n\nIn the interest of clarity and not taking Judge out of context, here is the larger exchange about dealing with NFL players with sleep disorders:\n\nQ: \"Can a sleep disorder affect a player's ability?\"\n\nQ: \"Has that occurred in your past where you have encountered players with sleep disorders?\"\n\nQ: \"And what did you do for those players?\"\n\nA: \"Well, we got them the CPAP machines. We tracked their sleep. We made sure they were evening out their sleep cycles, that they're properly rested. That was several players over the course of years.\n\n\"And then there was also the players that we would have to educate — this is always a tough conversation to have. It's not a popular opinion, this is the truth, we would have to educate significant others who may have been pregnant during the season, or were going to have a baby during the season, and you'd have to educate them on — you have this baby in the middle of the season, that father has to play good football. It's a day-by-day production business. He has to be ready to perform and go out there and play, and when I say that is, you need to let him sleep. He needs to be in another room, detached.\n\n\"You have to explain to the mother, 'Listen, he ain't waking up for the midnight feedings. After the season, he's full metal jacket. You can do whatever you want with him, he'll change every diaper. In season, he's got to have a different priority.\n\n\"Now, there were examples to use from that. We had some older veteran players — I can or can't share names if you want me too — who had multiple children who would sleep in other rooms. Their wives would bring in family or a nursing aid to help throughout the night, and those players continue to play high-level football. We had other players who are young who quite simply did what every other father in the world does, waking up, changing diapers, doing feedings, and led to injuries, led to soft-tissue injuries, not being rested, not being recovered, not being ready to roll.\"\n\nQ: \"That never occurred to me, that newborns can affect injuries on the football field. But who had to deliver that message?\"\n\nQ: \"And to whom did you deliver the message?\"\n\nA: \"About as good as you'd expect (laughs).\"",

    "description": "A fast start and tremendous defensive work carried the No. 7 Bremen girls basketball team to a Class 2A regional crown at LaPorte Saturday.",
    "fullText": "LAPORTE ― The Bremen girls basketball team was a heavy favorite to cut down the regional nets Saturday evening.\n\nThe Lions made sure to do just that too.\n\nBremen rode a dominating start to sideline Andrean 61-32 in a Class 2A regional game at LaPorte High School on Feb. 14.\n\nThe No. 7 Lions, who opened the game up 12-0, improved to 23-2 with the fourth regional title in program history.\n\nUpset! Marquette Catholic girls basketball loses IHSAA regional to Fremont\n\nMore Bremen hoops: Chase Devine wills Bremen boys basketball to the conference championship\n\nBremen advances to the four-team semi-state next Saturday, Feb. 21. The bracket and location were not announced as of Saturday night.\n\nAndrean, which had 22 turnovers and just eight total field goals in the lopsided loss, finished at 11-14.\n\nThe Bremen senior class was its usual outstanding self Saturday. Guard Emma Lawmaster led the way with 17 points, while classmate and guard Eliana Grubbs scored 16 points, senior forward Natalie Harmon eight and senior guard Emma Lawmaster seven.\n\nThe laser-focused Lions made sure they would not leave the regional round disappointed this time around. Bremen, after winning a Class 3A regional crown in 2024, fell to Whitko 53-44 in the 2A regional a season ago to finish at 24-3.\n\n\"We know that it's win now or we will not play again,\" said Grubbs matter-of-factly following the blowout win as she gripped a piece of the championship net tightly. \"We were ready today. We were locked in at practice all week. We were pretty confident, but we know that we have to keep a level head too.\"\n\nAndrean, which entered play averaging just 39 ppg., turned the ball over on its first four possessions of the game. The Lions, using enough full court pressure to completely stifle the 59ers, led 12-0. Bremen led 14-7 after the opening period.\n\n\"Our girls did an outstanding job defensively today,\" said Bremen coach Alex Robinson. \"We knew this was a good matchup versus our defense. Our girls have played in these regional games twice before and they knew how important it was to start fast. A 12-0 start was just what we wanted.\n\n\"Our identity is our seniors. They are so poised and unselfish. They know what it's like to have a different feeling than today (the regional loss in 2025). They have just put a lot of work in to accomplish this. Their commitment has been just outstanding.\"\n\nAndrean got within 14-10 early in the second period. The Lions then closed the half with a 16-7 run to lead 30-17 at intermission. Grubbs had 11 first half points while Andrean had 13 turnovers and made just one two-point basket in the first half. That one field goal came with just 12 seconds to play in the opening half. Andrean did hit four treys in the first half.\n\nBremen put the foot on the gas in the third period to blow the game open. The Lions outscored Andrean 16-5 in the stanza to take a 46-22 lead. Kincaid netted seven points in the period and Andrean shot just 2-of-12 from the field.\n\n\"We were really motivated today,\" said Kincaid, who like Grubbs went over 1,000 career points earlier this season. \"We are going to do whatever it takes. We were pretty confident and pretty focused. We know that we cannot relax.\"\n\nThe Lions entered play Saturday allowing just 29 ppg.\n\n\"Every single person on our team does their job,\" said Kincaid of the defensive work of her team. \"Everyone puts in the work on the defensive end.\"\n\nThe Lions got great play defensively on the inside from the 5-10 Harmon, along with 6-2 junior Teegan Feathers and 6-0 sophomore Skylee Feathers.\n\n\"We knew our defense was going to lock them down,\" Grubbs said. \"We depend on them (Harmon and both Feathers) a lot. We say let them go into the trees.\"\n\nGrubbs, who will play at Cornerstone University, is the top scorer in a balanced Bremen offense at 14.3 ppg. Kincaid averages 14 ppg and Lawmaster 10 ppg.\n\nTeegan Feathers, the fifth starter, led her team with 10 rebounds. She also swatted away at least a handful of Andrean shot attempts.\n\n\"That's a dynamic we have with the rim protection back there,\" noted Robinson. \"We had a lot of blocked shots today and those are big.\"\n\nSkylee Feathers had six points for Bremen. The Lions two losses this season was a 46-39 overtime decision to Tippecanoe Valley and a 46-43 setback to Elkhart Christian Academy.\n\nAmdrea shot just 8-of-39 from the field. Sophomore Charlee Murphy and sophomore Delaney Myers each had seven points to pace the 59ers.\n\nAndrean loses just one senior in starter Lailona Staten. Staten, who had two points Saturday, was her team's top scorer on the season at 8 ppg.\n\nThis article originally appeared on South Bend Tribune: Bremen girls basketball beats Andrean for IHSAA 2A regional title",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStar guard Luka Doncic has missed the last four games for the Los Angeles Lakers due to a left hamstring strain.\n\nThe injury placed his status for the 2026 NBA All-Star game in doubt, but it sounds like that doubt can now be erased.\n\nWhile speaking with media members at All-Star weekend, Doncic revealed that he’s feeling better and plans to play a little bit, at least.\n\n“I feel pretty good. I’ve been working to get back,” Doncic said. “Obviously I wanted to play the last game, but it wasn’t possible. I was almost there. So I think I will play a little bit.”\n\nTechnically, playing in the exhibition could be a good way for Doncic to ease himself back into action, though he shouldn’t be expected to play many minutes, given the injury.\n\nIt will be the sixth career All-Star appearance for Doncic, who was selected as a starter for the game.\n\nOn the season, Doncic has appeared in 42 games for the Lakers and is averaging 32.8 points, 8.6 assists, 7.8 rebounds and 1.4 steals per performance.\n\nVictor Wembanyama sends clear message about being the next face of the NBA\n\nV.J.

    "description": "Purdue rolls to an easy win in Iowa City.",
    "fullText": "Hey, Purdue basketball is good again!\n\nA week ago we watched Purdue slog through an ugly home win against a very bad Oregon team in West Lafayette. It did not look good as the team prepared to head out on a two-game road trip. Nebraska was a top 10 team and Iowa had pushed Purdue earlier this year in West Lafayette.\n\nWell, after 85 minutes of basketball, the Boilermakers were mostly dominant for about 75 of those minutes and it gets the prize of two Tier 1 NET road victories.\n\nThis is the Purdue team we expected. Tonight it had virtually no problems as it jumped out to a 19-7 lead and never looked back. Unlike Tuesday, Purdue did trail in regulation. It was down 5-4 for about 16 seconds, so we can technically call this a come-from-behind win.\n\nCongrats to Matt Painter for his 250th career Big Ten win as a head coach. He is only the 4th such coach to reach that mark, joining Hall of Famers Tom Izzo, Bob Knight, and Gene Keady. He is well on track to pass Keady next season.\n\nBraden Smith gets back on track for the assists record with 10 on Tuesday and 12 tonight. He’d probably have a few more too if opn shots were hit. Tonight he passed Steve Blake for 6th on the all-time NCAA list and he has 980 for his career. Next up is Keith Jennings of East Tennessee State, who has 983. With three straight home games he is likely to become just the fifth Division I player with 1,000 career assists sometime in the next three games. He is averging just under 8.9 per game this season, and if he maintains that average Purdue will need to play five postseason games between the two tournaments to get the record. The FDU game is sitting there like a bomb, as it cost him at least one more game.\n\nHow about the game by Gicarri Harris! He was the main driver in opening up Purdue’s big early lead with three threes and an impressive dunk that led to an and-1.\n\nSimilar game for CJ Cox. Cox and Harris are the complimentary guys that, when they are hitting, Purdue is awfully difficult to beat. Tonight they combined for 28 points and 7 of 15 from three. Cox especially has played well in the second half on this road trip.\n\nTrey Kaufman-Renn as a rebounding machine these last two games have been huge. He had more scoring tonight with 12 points, but he grabbed 31 rebounds in two games. When he is a rebounding demon and Braden is dishing out 10+ assists this team is awfully good.\n\nMuch better night at the line going 16 of 20, though it is really 16 of 22 since the front end of two one-and-ones were missed.\n\nPurdue looked like it learned a bit from Tuesday. It kept the foot on the gas and actually worked clock while attacking the basket in the final three minutes.\n\nWhat we saw tonight is the exact formula Purdue needs if it is going to achieves all its goals this year. It needs to shoot 35-40% from three. It needs TKR to rebound like a mad bastard. It needs to continue challenging threes. It needs Cox and Harris to be great complimentary scorers. Do all those and we’re going to be very tough to beat.\n\nAbsolutely zero complaints in this one. We beat a solid NCAA Tournament team on its home floor by 21 points. Flawless.\n\nWe’re now in the home stretch. We have six regular season games left, and four of them are in the friendly confines of Mackey Arena. More importantly, we’re rounding into form right as the presumed No. 1 team in the country comes to West Lafayette. Tuesday is going to be a madhouse. It is why we love college basketball. A win, and Purdue is very much alive for its 27th Big Ten championship. Lose, and it is far from a bad loss, but at that point it likely becomes a scenario where we need to finish strong for a 2 seed.\n\nThe impressive thing is that Purdue passed this very tough two-game road trip with flying colors. Let’s get this one Tuesday night and make this a race.",

Then the Wolfpack just gave the game away.\n\nWith 1:07 left, Lubin grabbed a rare offensive rebound and put it back in for a 76-69 Pack lead. NC State would not score again. Lubin turned it over, then Holloman turned it over, Copeland fouled with 27 seconds, but they missed, then Copeland got fouled with 17 seconds left and missed the front end of the 1 & 1, and with NC State holding a 2-point lead, at the 3 second mark Williams fouled the 3PT shooter. Washington made all three free throws for the final score, 77-76.\n\nThe Pack had this game won, and gave it away in the final minute\n\nMiami had 20 offensive rebounds resulting in 12 more FG attempts\n\nMatt Able had one of his better games and tied for the scoring lead with Lubin with 17\n\nVen Lubin led rebounding with 9",

    "description": "Ole Miss assistant coach and former Giants head coach Joe Judge made waves on Thursday with his testimony in the Trinidad Chambliss eligibility case.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss assistant coach and former Giants head coach Joe Judge made waves on Thursday with his testimony in the Trinidad Chambliss eligibility case. Judge is now trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube.\n\nOn Friday morning, Judge explained to PFT (in a message sent through PFT Live co-host Chris Simms) that his comments about educating spouses and significant others about the importance of letting players get their sleep when a newborn baby is in the house related to his time with NFL players, not college players. On Saturday, Judge provided a more lengthy statement about the distinction on Twitter.\n\n\"Some of my comments from Thursday have been taken out of context, so I'd like to provide some clarity,\" Judge said. \"In a discussion about Trinidad's sleep apnea, I was trying to point out the importance that the NFL places on sleep for recovery and performance in addition to the education of balancing family dynamics during the football season.\n\n\"These are discussions I was a part of at the professional level from veteran players based on their own experience managing similar situations. These are not discussions we've had at the collegiate level. As a husband and father of four children, I understand those challenges first hand and would never diminish the commitment to family. We share that same dedication to family with our players and always support them through any challenges they face in their personal lives.\"\n\nThe most obvious response to Judge's clarification is this: If his comments had no relevance to college athletes, why did he say what he said within the context of testimony in a case about the eligibility of a college football player?\n\nBeyond that, Judge's explanation that he would never diminish the commitment to family ignores the fact that, at the NFL level, he did.\n\nThe bigger point is this. Judge was working with Chambliss's lawyers in an effort to help him secure an extra year of eligibility. Ole Miss wants him back for another year, so that he can help them win as many games as possible. Judge, as a result, said what he believed he needed to say in order to make the case that the sleep issues arises arising from Chambliss's respiratory problem should qualify for a medical redshirt as to his 2022 season at Ferris State.\n\nIt was a strategy, a calculation aimed at helping Ole Mis get the player they want. In lieu of telling Chambliss's lawyers that making the point about shielding NFL players from responsibility to care for newborns during football season was a bridge too far, Judge was all in with whatever it took to help win the case.\n\nJudge is now trying to have it both ways. He made the point he made to help Ole Miss get Chambliss for another year. Now, Judge wants to avoid the consequences of what he said by saying he never said anything like that to college players, only NFL players.\n\nIt would be better for Judge to just accept the win in the Chambliss case and take the heat for what he said. Judge told the court the story about football players and infants and sleep because he thought it would help Ole Miss get Chambliss for the 2026 season. It worked. It's now too late for Judge to try to say he didn't say what he said.",

    "fullText": "AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Australia has won the New Zealand leg of the SailGP series, though racing was overshadowed by a crash involving New Zealand and France on Saturday which left a sailor from each team with serious injuries.\n\nDriver Tom Slingsby steered the Australian Flying Roos to victory in the three-boat final Sunday ahead of Spain and Britain. Britain won the first event of the series in Perth, Australia and now shares the overall series lead with the Australians.\n\nOrganizers decided to break the fleet into two groups for racing on the second day Sunday because of expected high winds. For the first time in SailGP history 13 boats took part in racing Saturday and congestion on a narrow course might have been a factor in the crash which saw the New Zealand and French boats extensively damaged.\n\nLouis Sinclair, a “grinder” who works the winches on the New Zealand boat, suffered compound fractures to both legs when the New Zealand Black Foils and France collided at almost 90 kmh (56 mph).\n\nIn a statement Sunday, the New Zealand team said \"Sinclair has had successful surgery on his right leg overnight after injuries suffered during yesterday’s collision with France.\n\n“The medical team involved in Sinclair’s treatment have been fantastic and are pleased with the results of the surgery and are positive about his ongoing recovery.”\n\nTeam New Zealand said “a comprehensive review of yesterday’s incident will be conducted in coordination with SailGP.”\n\nFrance strategist Manon Audinet also was injured in the crash. The French team said Audinet suffered abdominal injuries.\n\n“She was thrown forward on impact and actually broke the steering wheel of the French boat,” a team statement said. “The entire Team France has Manon Audinet and Louis Sinclair in their thoughts and stands fully alongside them during this time.”\n\nNew Zealand and France now face a tight schedule to repair their boats in time for the next leg of the series in Sydney in two weeks time. France suffered damage to one hull but the New Zealand boat seems to be far more extensively damaged.\n\nRacing on Sunday took place in gusty conditions ahead of an impending thunderstorm and the highest speed recorded by any of the matching 50-foot catamarans was 101.99 kmh (63 mph).\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

    "description": "Here's everything Todd Golden said after Florida basketball beat the Kentucky Wildcats at home on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "Another game, another win for Florida basketball after beating the Kentucky Wildcats inside the O'Connell Center on Saturday afternoon, 92-83. That makes it five-straight victories for the Gators as the regular-season schedule begins to fade into March Madness.\n\nXaivian Lee led the charge as his late-season surge finally showed the promise he brought when he arrived via the transfer portal from Princeton, dropping a game-high 22 points along with three assists and two rebounds. Urban Klavžar added 19 as well to bolster a resurgent Florida backcourt.\n\nFollowing the Valentine's Day triumph, Todd Golden talked about his team's effort with the sports media. Here is what he had to say.\n\n\"Yeah, you know, really good college basketball game. I thought we did a really good job first half, getting off to a great start. I thought we kind of lost our edge a little bit in the middle of the first half.\n\n\"I heard you guys talking about the Rueben three, we kind of were lackadaisical with the ball in transition a little bit when I thought we could have maybe knocked them out. But credit to Kentucky, I thought they did a good job fighting, cutting that lead. They went on a 10-0 run on the heels of that, and nip and tuck a little bit early of the first 10 minutes of the second half.\n\n\"But I thought we did a really good job, relentless getting on the glass, you know, especially last 10 minutes of the game and making sure we got second-chance opportunities, making sure we got to the line. And our defense was great early, not great in the middle, but pretty good late guarding the line and making sure that we didn't give up any sort of run down the stretch.\n\n\"So, great win. I don't think we played our best, but we played well enough.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, he's playing great, right? I mean, he was fantastic at Georgia, he was great at Vanderbilt. He's stacked some really good games over the last couple of weeks, and I thought he was fantastic today. Just got off to a great start knocking shots down.\n\n\"To your point, he did a really good job of playing with great patience in the paint, playing off two, making good decisions. And he gave us a big lift. Obviously, him and Urby shooting the ball the way they did allowed us to win the game the way we did today.\"\n\n\"I thought Micah was great. I thought, you know, obviously the stat sheet doesn't tell the story minus the plus/minus. You know, it felt really good with him out there. He did a great job defensively, cleaned up on the glass.\n\n\"And obviously Rueben is, I would argue, the best defensive player in America, and Micah hasn't been any at that level clearly, but I thought today he did a great job of not allowing any fall-off when he was in the game, and that allowed us to play really well when he was in there and go plus-14.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, a big part of our scout was to make it tough on obviously Otega and 'Zel, and they went 12-for-35 combined from the field, one for nine from three. I thought we did a really good job of defending those guys.\n\n\"They were trying to score, and we knew that, and so we wanted to keep two on the ball when they were getting downhill, kind of force them into those play-making decisions. And overall, it was really good for us. And the things that hurt us were other things.\n\n\"Like, I thought we did a really poor job on Chandler, letting him get some space. I thought we did a poor job on Dioubate, letting him get left.\n\n\"So big-picture-wise, I thought scouting-wise we did a decent job in the main parts of what we were trying to accomplish, but the auxiliary stuff really bothered us and it allowed Kentucky to stay in the game.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, I think he's, as I've told you guys, he's a great player. People want to poke at things about our team or about our personnel when we're not doing everything perfectly, but you look at the big picture, and how many guys in America would you trade Alex Condon for?\n\n\"I can't think of any at that spot. And he's been a huge winner for us. And the double-double, huge, but it's his defense, it's his winning plays, it's his effort that's unmatched, and it's why he's such a great player.\"\n\n\"I mean, we lost our first year here when we were a little banged up. They got us in a great game when they had Sheppard and Rob Dillingham. We led most of the game and they won it late. Aaron Bradshaw hit a big three. That was interesting. And then this was the next time we got them in here and we took care of business.\n\n\"Obviously, won there two years ago. So, you know, it is what it is, and just the way the schedule shaped up, and now we're gonna have a really tough challenge going back to Rupp.\n\n\"Obviously, Kentucky is playing a lot better. There's no doubt about that. I stick by what I said, their ability and the fact that they have some guys out and the rotation has shrunk has allowed people to get comfortable in their roles, and they're playing a lot better for it.\n\n\"So, there's a reason why they were able to climb into second after a tough starting league play. So they're playing some good ball. They're talented.\n\n\"Obviously, a $22 million roster. They're physical, they're big and I expect them to do well the rest of the year. They're a really good team.\"\n\n\"Listen, our crowd is incredible. And we had to earn it when we got the job here in terms of getting kind of the excitement back in the O'Dome. But as I said before, this is why it's a great place. People really appreciate winning, and they want to be a part of it. They want to be around it.\n\n\"And when we've given them a semblance of hope about our program, they've shown up for us and supported us in a big way. And today was no different. It was a great crowd, great atmosphere. There's a reason why college basketball is what it is right now.\n\n\"It's games like this on ABC that make it special. And this was a great game.\"\n\n\"We're trending. I don't necessarily have a goal of where we want to be at a certain point. We just want to get better, and we've definitely done that over the course of conference play. We've improved in a lot of different ways. Our bench has really stepped up and given us the ability to play eight and be complete that way. And we've been pretty consistent.\n\n\"Obviously, we didn't play well against Auburn in here, and that one will sting us a little bit, but we haven't lost since that game. And besides Missouri, in a game where I didn't think we played great, and they're improving. They're a very good team. They won on the road at Kentucky. They won on the road at Texas A&M earlier in the week.\n\n\"So, you know, they're starting to hit their stride, but we're getting there. We're not all the way. I thought today we took a step back in some of the areas that we had been growing in, but we're also getting a lot better in some areas that I didn't expect us to maybe jump in.\n\n\"It means everything to me, to be honest. The love that we have for those guys is immeasurable. I think they changed a lot of people's lives during their time here in Gainesville. And they're great dudes. They're a great representation of our program, and obviously led us to a national championship.\n\n\"And a lot of guys want to go to the Bahamas, or they want to go to Cabo or Miami, and the fact that these guys came to be with us. They were here yesterday in practice; they sat in with us during film. They were here at shootaround today.\n\n\"Obviously, they got a well-deserved moment of recognition sitting there courtside. And it's just incredible, man. Nobody can ever take away from us what we did together, and I anticipate that relationship with the university being strong for a long time.\"\n\n\"I'm never going to say that a loss benefits us in that sense, but I will say that we responded the right way from it. You have to tip your crap. I thougth Auburn played really well. We didn't have our best that day. It can happen.\n\n\"This league's really good. There's a lot of really talented teams. What we've been able to do ... I think is pretty incredible. We're winning most every game by double digits. We're doing it comfortably. We're guarding at an elite level. I think our offense and defense have been top five nationally over the last 10 games, so we are turning into a complete team.\n\n\"We knew this was going to take a little bit of time. We played a tough schedule, lost a little confidence. We were trying to shape through all that, but it's mid-February and we're playing some good ball. As we have talked about, and will continue to talk about I don't think we are at our peak yet.\n\n\"I think we have areas that we can still improve, but we're headed in the right direction.\n\n\"I thought we did a great job on him. I thought he'd get some tough shows. The one I was disappointed with was the with three we gave up in the first half on the ball screen where our help wasn't high enough. We understand that for this team, Otega and Aberdeen are going to try and make all of the points.\n\n\"We got to do a good job of running Chandler off the line, which we didn't. But if we could cut their waiter off and that we would give ourselves a good chance to win. They're both really good players and you're not going to make them miss every time.\n\n\"But you know to go combined 12 of 35, that's winning basketball for sure.\"\n\n\"It means a lot because you're in position. It means first of all that you are playing well, and you're trying to win a league. But it doesn't change how we approach anything we do. We're not going to talk about holding onto first place leading up to the South Carolina game. It really has nothing to do with that.\n\n\"I do think, to talk about the Auburn game, that might have been a little bit of our issue that day. We were talking about getting back in position to win the league, look too far forward. This team has been at its best when we've living in the now, and focusing on getting better every day, and not worrying about anything other than the next game.\"\n\n\"Well, I think Kentucky has been rebounding the ball better. Tennessee got them on the glass but if you look at their last five or so matchups, they've been getting close to 30% of their misses back or more.\n\n\"They are playing much bigger than they were earlier. I think its kind of a result of that. Rebounding was a big part of the scout. It was a concern of ours to make sure we kept them off the glass. They got us early. They weren't making shots. They were getting their second chances.\n\n\"We weren't putting any pressure on the offensive glass. I think we were even at halftime on the glass, but I thought they won the boards. They won the battle of the boards in the first half, but we did a much better job. Our tenaciousness, our physicality, showed up in the last 10 minutes of the game.\n\n\"I thought we dominated that way. We kind of refused to not get the ball. That has to be our calling card as we move forward.\"\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida basketball postgame quotes from Todd golden after Kentucky win",

    "description": "What does Germaine Pratt's free agent contract projection look like and will the Indianapolis Colts re-sign him?",
    "fullText": "Indianapolis Colts linebacker Germaine Pratt is set to be a free agent this upcoming offseason.\n\nSo what might his next contract look like, and will the Colts re-sign him?\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Pratt is projected to land a one-year deal in free agency worth $2.874 million.\n\nIn terms of player age, contract status, and statistical production, Christian Rozeboom, EJ Speed, and Eric Wilson were used by Spotrac as comparisons to determine what Pratt's deal could be.\n\nThe addition of Pratt early on in the season helped provide some stability at linebacker for the Colts. Prior to signing Pratt, several different linebackers saw starting snaps next to Zaire Franklin.\n\nPratt finished his season with the Colts recording 101 total tackles and holding pass-catchers to 10.1 yards per reception. He also had one interception and three pass breakups.\n\nIf Pratt's contract is in the ballpark that Spotrac is projecting, we can't rule out his return to the Colts. It's a short-term deal that doesn't break the bank.\n\nHowever, GM Chris Ballard said that he wanted to get younger and faster on defense this offseason. Re-signing Pratt doesn't accomplish that.\n\nPrediction: Pratt is not re-signed.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts free agency: Will Germaine Pratt be re-signed?

    "fullText": "This past week, I asked a question that was originally suggested by Johnny, aka Alpha6:\n\nWith the idea that our Miami Dolphins have taken multiple members of both the front office and coaching staff away from the Green Bay Packers to rebuild the staff in Miami, do you see the Packers taking a step back, aka are they now weakened by subtraction, and/or will our own Dolphins take a step forward, aka strengthened by addition?\n\nI did not receive as many answers as I would have liked, but below are some of the thoughts and answers that we did get-\n\nTheRoo1 chimed in with some more ideas for us to base articles on. Always appreciated! Any ideas at any time can be sent to me via the comments section of my post or directly via my X/Twitter account.\n\nJames, since the Phins will be bargain basement shoppers this year in free agency, articles on matching needs to low budget fills,,,, pick a position group and go.\n\nhighlight miami rehab facility, association with Baptist health, can Phins develop a reputation as a preferred location for players rehabbing or returning from injury, Can we get some good one or two year rentals of returning players wanting to take advantage of Phin facilities and staff .\n\nA primer article on contract types, futures etc, effect on salary cap, cap dates, requirements, and ways to stretch the cap.\n\nfinfanfromsiam, in response to TheRoo1 wants no more broken-down players.\n\nPlease no more injured players with upside or potential….!\n\nCaliFins, in response to finfanfromsiam concurs on the broken-down player thing and does not want players signed just because they used to be great.\n\nThat was my biggest gripe. We are cap strapped, but we are going to bring in an injured Beckham and have him just collect a check for most of the season so we can sell jerseys with his name on them. Or hey, next season let’s do it again with Waller!! That $3Mill for Beckham was thrown away and McDaniel was so busy looking at his shinny new toy in Waller and thinking of all the great things he can open up for him, that he missed seeing Dulcich on his own practice squad until the end of the season.\n\nI’m glad this regime is seeing it. Built a tough next man up culture from within. Nurture players for years, don’t rent them for one or two.\n\nDolfanjoe hopes that we are not doing this all over again in 4-6 years.\n\nShould we put the Dolphin flag at (Half Staff ) ! Retaining some of the Miami staff and adding GBs to the top of the food chain ? What happens in 27 when we have the first pick in the draft ? Will they say plan has gone perfectly. Or will the Fan’s be clamoring for off with there heads ! Will GB be there with the second pick in the draft because they lost Coaches and couldn’t find anyone to take there place ? I have yet to see how long the contracts are for our head coach and GM. I would guess about 6 years. Hopefully by 4 they have earned them. I keep using the magic 8 ball i have found at the garage sale, of course while wearing my Ricky jersey i bought for ten bucks. And each time i ask if they made the right decision the answer keeps coming up Try Again ? Does that mean in 6 years try again or this thing is stuck ? Oh well i guess we have years to decide if all is well with the Universe……………………\n\ncoach k 13 likes the idea of adding staff from the GB Pakcker due to their past success.\n\nI could really care less what happens with Green bay! LOL!, but I like Miami getting coaches from the Packers, Let’s face it, they have been a solid team for many many years.\n\nfinfanfromsiam belives that Green Bay will hold onto their culture and just reload. Also hopes that it translates the same way for the Dolphins.\n\nI think the Packers will reload and be fine. They have their culture and way of doing things so will be ok. We can only hope that translates to be what we can build here. I think getting rid of the anchor of Grier/McDaniel is addition by subtraction. The new infusion of blood should propel us forward to hopefully reach in the same neighborhood of Green Bay. We will see how it pans out starting in March.\n\nSpok507 doesn’t know much about Packers guys, but seems encouraged that they are going to move on from Tua.\n\nI’ll admit I don’t know much about the new GM and HC and even less about the Packers. I can only hope they have a plan to bring this franchise back to prominence. I’ve waited a long time for them to move on from the mistake of drafting Tua, so I have to hope things will improve. I do believe they can rebuild as long as they focus on substance instead of flash now.\n\nWell thats it for our comments this evening. As always, thank you to each of you who took the time to answer our Phinsider Question Of The Day. I will return tomorrow evening with a new question of the day post.",

    "description": "Liverpool 3-0 Brighton: Salah scored and assisted to continue the healing process after his outburst late last year as the Reds stayed on course for FA Cup glory",
    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah patted the badge on his chest as the Kop chorused his song. It was a rare feat, even by his standards: just the third time in his Liverpool career he had scored, assisted and won a penalty in the same game.\n\nAs Salah was able to celebrate with his public again after scoring, his 252nd goal for Liverpool was only his second since his incendiary interview at Leeds. The process of reintegration began with a cameo against Brighton in December. It accelerated with a spot-kick against Albion in February.\n\nHe won it and scored it, tripped by Pascal Gross, rifling his shot into the roof of the net. He had only struck once in his previous 12 games for Liverpool, and that was against Qarabag. He had not found the net against a Premier League club since Aston Villa’s visit at the start of November. This meant a lot. “It was very big for the confidence,” said Salah. “It was very big, for sure.” It felt like another step in the healing process. “It is very nice to have him on the scoresheet again but what I like is that he is helping the team defensively,” said Arne Slot.\n\nWhatever the summer holds for him, Liverpool could enjoy the sight of Salah looking irrepressible. Perhaps, too, they could be grateful that what looked a crisis was defused. That may reflect well on Slot and if the Dutchman has had too few games this season when every decision he has made has brought a rich reward, this victory came with sweet vindication.\n\nAs the Liverpool manager fielded his latest line-up without a specialist right-back, the assumption might have been that Dominik Szoboszlai was in the back four and Curtis Jones in midfield. Instead, it was the other way around.\n\nEach was on the scoresheet, and in a way that reflected the role Slot had given him. Jones scored for the first time since 2024 by materialising at the far post. Szoboszlai used his running power to burst through the inside-right channel and unleash his second unstoppable shot in as many weeks at Anfield.\n\nIn the process, Slot may have learned a lesson from a game when his choices backfired. At the corresponding stage of the FA Cup a year ago, he selected too much of a weakened side and suffered the embarrassment of defeat to Plymouth. Twelve months on, he started with nine of his strongest available 11 and, while Hugo Ekitike and Ryan Gravenberch began on the bench, the Dutchman’s rest permitted Jones’s return and allowed Szoboszlai to play in midfield.\n\nThe context has changed from Slot’s first taste of the FA Cup, which ended so ignominiously in Devon. Now it is Liverpool’s most realistic chance of silverware this season, and they swept into the fifth round. Their league position remains unsatisfactory but they have only been beaten twice in 18 outings in all competitions and, after the frustration of last week’s loss to Manchester City, they have conjured a response by beating Sunderland and Brighton.\n\nTheir season has been a story of makeshift right-backs and, for all the issues injuries have posed, they have added some productivity. Szoboszlai has twin spectacular free kicks against Arsenal and City when deployed as a defender. Jones ended a lengthy drought when – in theory, anyway – stationed further from the Brighton goal. “There have been times I’ve scored more but not played as well as I am now,” he said after getting a first goal in 58 games.\n\nThe Liverpudlian had come agonisingly close with a left-footed shot from 20 yards. Then, meeting Milos Kerkez’s inviting cross on the half-volley, he crashed in a shot off the underside of the bar. “It was very pleasing the first goal was an assist from the left-back to the right-back,” Slot said.\n\nKerkez ended up being overshadowed – not least by his fellow Hungairan – but he was terrific. He married deft skill with dynamic runs. He had drawn a fine save from Jason Steele with a rising, rasping half-volley. Then came his assist.\n\n“The second goal was even nicer than the first one,” Slot said. Salah cushioned a pass into the path of the surging Szoboszlai and, without breaking stride, he drove a shot past Steele. “He is one of the best players in the world right now,” said Salah. Szoboszlai earned a fourth assist for the Egyptian since his return from the African Cup of Nations.\n\nWhen the 33-year-old then scored himself from the penalty spot, it was cue for Slot to substitute him, to a rousing ovation. His replacement Rio Ngumoha had a goal ruled out for offside; there was no VAR to prove he was onside. Meanwhile, Brighton objected to Salah’s spot kick. “Poor decision,” said Fabian Hurzeler. “Never a penalty.”\n\nHe could also lament moments either side of the interval. “We had enough chances to score a goal,” added Hurzeler. But Alisson saved from Diego Gomez, coming to Jones’s rescue after he slipped. He clawed away Lewis Dunk’s header. After his error against City, it was a redemptive return to Anfield for Alisson, and justification for Slot in selecting him, rather than Giorgi Mamardashvili.\n\nSo there was no seismic double for Brighton, conquerors of Manchester United at Old Trafford in the third round, no cup run deflect from underachievement in the Premier League.\n\n“We are not in a good moment,” Hurzeler said. But now Salah is.",

    "description": "After a strong win against Brighton to advance in the FA Cup, we take a look at what it all means for Arne Slot’s Reds.",
    "fullText": "Don’t say it too loud, but Liverpool are starting to become fun to watch again. It’s still not the most convincing Liverpool side, and there are plenty of worries about the effectiveness of the formation and some of the seemingly nailed on starters. Still, there was more emphasis on the attack in a fairly open match with Brighton that saw Liverpool deservedly take a 1-0 lead just ahead of halftime before blowing the game open in the second half as the Reds now advance to the quarterfinals of the FA Cup.\n\nBelow, we take a look at some winners and losers on the night, and attempt to disentangle narrative from fact.\n\nThe Hungarian left back has quite possibly his best performance for Liverpool to date. He was very solid with his positioning and 1v1 defending throughout the match, and showed great aggressiveness getting forward into the attack. He set up the first goal by running down a loose ball before it could go out of play and then sending in a perfect cross that was tapped home by Curtis Jones. Kerkez also forced a brilliant save with a rocket from distance after making himself available for a free kick sent over the top with a heads up early run down the left wing.\n\nThe Scouser got a rare start since the start of the new year, becoming the latest victim…er player…to slide into the seemingly cursed right back role. Curtis did what he needed to do defensively and was calm withstanding the press out of the back. He scored the opening goal with an instinctive finish from a midfielder’s late run, tapping in from close range after a sumptuous cross by Milos Kerkez. Jones shifted into midfield midway through the second half, and continued to be a strong presence. He finished with an almost 90% pass completion rate.\n\nSzobo returned from his one match suspension, and was somewhat surprisingly unshackled into the midfield. The high press was immediately better than we have seen recently with his presence in the midfield. The Hungarian put in a peach of a set piece that was headed into the net by Cody Gakpo, but the attacker was offside. Szoboszlai made no mistake with his own opportunity as he steamed forward from midfield to get on the end of a perfect layoff by Mohamed Salah before slamming the ball past the goalkeeper from the top of the box. Szoboszlai finished with an almost perfect 47 for 48 passing.\n\nThere were still plenty of worrying signs about the decline of Salah throughout the match, but he came up big in a couple of key moments to blow the match wide open. His cushioned first-time pass off of a crossfield ball from Cody Gakpo was perfectly weighted for the run of Szoboszlai that was finished off for the second goal of the match. Mo found a little bit of his old magic later in the second half, facing up a defender and just straight running through him on the dribble before forcing a clear foul in the box that was actually awarded as a penalty kick. Mo drilled the spot kick into the top corner to finish the match with a goal and an assist.\n\nAli had two huge interventions to preserve the lead when Liverpool were only up a goal. He made a fantastic 1v1 save after Curtis Jones slipped, allowing Diego Gomez through on goal. Alisson also made a perfectly timed punch on a header that was put back across the face of goal just ahead of several Brighton players could get a touch. In total, Alisson finished with 3 saves and a couple heart-in-mouth moments with the ball at his feet. All in a day’s work.\n\nCody continues to be a ever present frustrating presence up top for the Reds. He did end up with a hockey assist for the second goal from a good crossfield ball for Mohamed Salah, but Gakpo’s only other real contributions was getting fouled. He was again offside in crucial situations where he really should have been able to get onside. He also was saved blushes after blocking a goalbound shot by Milos Kerkez after the flag went up for offside.\n\nGiven a rare opportunity to start Chiesa failed to have any real impact on the match. His effervescent energy and boundless running seems a lot more effective when he comes on as a sub. He finished with just 14 touches during his 76 minutes, with one shot.\n\nWith a midweek match, there were many who thought Arne Slot may rotate a decent number of players for the cup match to rest some weary legs. In the end, only Ryan Gravenberch and Hugo Ekitike of the regular starters were rotated out, giving opportunities to Curtis Jones and Federico Chiesa. It would appear that Slot feels the need to put forth a strong effort in the FA Cup competition after a disastrous fall and winter have put him on thin ice with most supporters. While there will rightfully be concerns about tired legs for the likes of Florian Wirtz, Alexis Mac Allister, and Virgil van Dijk, the ability to start and build some positive momentum may just have been worth it with a week of rest before the next match.\n\nLiverpool will return to Premier League play next Sunday as they travel to face struggling Nottingham Forest. The hosts will be playing their first league match under new manager Vitor Pereira after Sean Dyche was sacked. Arne Slot will hope his side can continue their positive progression after winning four of their past five matches, and beginning to look like a side that is fun to watch again. Liverpool will need to start stacking up wins as they try to stay in the hunt for Champions League places in the table.",

    "description": "Michigan Hockey looked the part of a National Championship contender with a convincing 6-3 win over the Penn State Nittany Lions:",
    "fullText": "There may have been nine combined goals, but it was a different recipe than usual as No. 2 Michigan Hockey secured a home sweep of No. 6 Penn State on Saturday night with a 6-3 victory.\n\nThe Wolverines (24-5-1, 14-4-1 Big Ten, 43 points) delivered one of their better defensive efforts of the season as freshman goaltender Jack Ivankovic looked like himself, making 30 saves and a handful of spectacular ones, including a lunging, glove stop to preserve a then 3-1 lead.\n\nAn empty-netter by junior forward Nick Moldenhauer made it 6-3 with 61 seconds left, and had it not been for a late Nittany Lions (18-9-1, 10-7-1 Big Ten, 33 points) two-goal push, the final score would have been more reflective of Michigan’s dominance.\n\nThe Wolverines did an excellent job of limiting high-danger chances and forcing Penn State into perimeter shots that Ivankovic made look easy.\n\nSeven-and-a-half minutes into the first, freshman forward Cole McKinney broke the ice. He won an offensive zone draw, did well to position himself in front of the crease and redirected a point shot-pass from senior defenseman Luca Fantilli. McKinney continues to make high-IQ plays, is a real face off weapon and looks far beyond his years.\n\nAlmost four minutes later, Moldenhauer got his first after junior defenseman Ben Robertson — who usually stands out for his responsible defensive game — made a nifty move on the right wing, drove into the slot and momentarily lost the puck. But Moldenhauer was there to tuck home Michigan’s second goal, making it 2-0.\n\nPenn State did answer, as it won a battle in the corner, and a drop pass led to forward Reese Laubach wristing a shot past Ivankovic. However, that was about all the Wolverines would allow, as the top pair of Fantilli and senior Tyler Duke shut down this high-octane attack. Meanwhile, Robertson and freshman Drew Schock helped hold down the fort, and sophomore Dakoda Rhéaume-Mullen and freshman Asher Barnett provide this unit with even more depth, smooth skating and jam.\n\nJunior forward Jayden Perron provided a crucial, tic-tac-toe power play insurance goal to make it 3-1 in the second. It started with senior forward T.J. Hughes, who had two assists, walking down the slot and hitting freshman forward Malcolm Spence on the post, who proceeded to find Perron in the low slot.\n\nUnlike Friday night’s up-and-down shootout, this was a far more encouraging performance from Michigan. Those defensemen and help from the forwards continued to stymie Penn State, which grew desperate to cut the deficit.\n\nInstead, it was sophomore Will Horcoff ending his four-game goal drought, as his right circle shot hit a skate and took a fortuitous bounce into the net. He has been in a bit of a slump lately and the hope is that lucky score reverses his fortunes.\n\nSophomore forward Michael Hage earned a secondary assist on Horcoff’s goal, too, bringing his total to two and furthering his outstanding offensive output.\n\nShortly thereafter, freshman forward Adam Valentini was the recipient of Spence poking the puck free off a faceoff and he was left alone for the Wolverines’ fifth goal.\n\nThe Nittany Lions did show life down the stretch, as Laubach scored on a power play and forward Luka Misa redirected a Gavin McKenna shot. Yet, it was too little too late, and after Moldenhauer’s empty netter, the Children of Yost were finally treated to some post-whistle scrums, which resulted in a bevy of penalties.\n\nNow, Michigan gets to celebrate its weekend before heading to Madison for a couple of dates with the Badgers.",

    "title": "On TikTok, we're all Chinese – but the trend doesn't paint the full picture",
    "description": "Chinamaxxing is adding more gloss to the recent flourish of Chinese soft power.",
    "fullText": "Or at least that's what they claim on TikTok, where a trend called \"Chinamaxxing\" has taken off in the West.\n\nChinese wellness practices, once associated with the tacky and geriatric, have suddenly found themselves in vogue, largely among Americans.\n\nFrom warm apple-boiled water to indoor slippers and longevity exercises, people are sharing videos of themselves \"learning to be Chinese\". Many come with the Fight Club-inspired caption \"you met me at a very Chinese time in my life\", or the hashtag #newlychinese.\n\nAs Donald Trump shakes up the world order, the Chinese Communist Party has welcomed this boost to the country's image.\n\nChinamaxxing is certainly adding more gloss to the recent flourish of Chinese soft power. Over the past year we've seen the world clamour for Labubu dolls, wait in line at brand new stores to buy Mixue bubble tea and Luckin coffee, and scroll through their friends' holiday feeds in the \"cyberpunk city\" of Chongqing.\n\nSome say Chinamaxxing stems from young Americans' disenchantment with their own country, although it's unclear how much that is really driving the trend.\n\nBut like so many internet trends, this one hardly paints the full picture. It's a celebration of memes and fleeting moments that make up just one slice of Chinese life. Beyond that are young people who, like their American counterparts, are also worried about their future in a sluggish economy and a fast-changing world.\n\nSome Chinese youth may find it strange that parts of their culture - long seen as \"uncool\" in the Western imagination - are now the object of fascination. Some may find it offensive that Westerners on TikTok are facetiously claiming they've been \"diagnosed as Chinese\".\n\nBut others say Chinamaxxing strikes a different note from derogatory jokes like \"bing chilling\" - where the punchline is ex-wrestler John Cena's stilted Mandarin pronunciation - or the \"social credit\" meme that mocks the Chinese government's restrictions on personal freedoms.\n\nThis time, Chinese people are in on the joke - not the butt of it.\n\nOne of the most influential figures behind the Chinamaxxing meme is Sherry Zhu, a Chinese-American TikTok content creator who regularly shares traditional wellness tips with her \"Chinese baddies\".\n\n\"Tomorrow you're turning Chinese,\" she tells her 740,000 TikTok followers. \"And I know that sounds intimidating, but there is no point in fighting it now.\"\n\nFew could have seen this coming.\n\nIt was not that long ago when the Covid pandemic sparked a wave of Sinophobia. Chinese diaspora spoke of racism and how people were avoiding the community and their businesses.\n\nThen a stunned world watched Beijing put its cities into hellish lockdowns. Reports emerged of residents running out of food and pleading for help from inside their sealed-off neighbourhoods. The restrictions ended only in early 2023 after rare protests. By then expats had left China in droves, many of them saying too much had changed.\n\nThere was also an exodus from Hong Kong, where Beijing's control was reshaping the city. This, along with China's growing power and assertiveness, strained the relationship with the West, even as the world's reliance on the Chinese economy became clear.\n\nMeanwhile, China's investments in tech, infrastructure and exports began to pay off - and became more visible as it reopened post pandemic, relaxing visa rules to bring back tourists.\n\nIt was hard to miss: glitzy skyscrapers, a sprawling high-speed rail network, highways packed with electric vehicles, and a boom in green energy, robotics and artificial intelligence. Chongqing - a humid southwestern metropolis which once made global headlines for a corruption scandal and murder - turned popular and cool.\n\nThere have been other, smaller triumphs. Young people around the world are snatching Adidas Tang-style jackets off the shelves, bingeing on Chinese micro-dramas and experimenting with powdery make-up looks flaunted by Chinese girls and women on Douyin, China's version of TikTok.\n\n\"As a Chinese person who has been online throughout years and years of heavy Sinophobia, it felt refreshing to have the mainstream opinion finally shift regarding China,\" Claire, a Chinese-Canadian TikTok user, tells BBC Chinese.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who shares political content on TikTok and would only reveal her first name for that reason, says, for her, the \"critical juncture\" was last year.\n\nThat was when she noticed a shift in attitudes about China. A wave of Americans arrived on RedNote, a popular Chinese social media app, ahead of a TikTok ban in the US.\n\nWithin days memes became the currency of these American \"TikTok refugees\" as two worlds that rarely interact because of China's internet firewall were brought closer.\n\n\"These young people have watched their physical reality remain frozen while China built entire cities,\" says Afra Wang, a tech writer and podcaster.\n\n\"When you can't build high-speed rail but you can scroll through videos of Chinese infrastructure, of course the future starts to look Chinese.\"\n\nFor observers like her, it's no coincidence that Chinamaxxing comes as the American Dream seems to be dimming.\n\nAmericans who came of age after the Iraq War, the 2008 global financial crisis or even the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot face a job market disrupted by globalisation and then AI, Wang says: \"American exceptionalism was never something they lived.\"\n\nWhat do people in China think of Chinamaxxing? Not much, it seems. The trend has stirred limited reactions on Chinese social media.\n\nRather, in the eyes of Chinese people, America, once seen as a beacon of success, has lost its shimmer. Not least because tensions between the two sides have made it harder for Chinese students who want to study or work there.\n\n\"During America's Chinamaxxing moment, China is experiencing its own America-minimising moment,\" Wang says.\n\nOn parts of Chinese social media, there are dystopian references to the \"US kill line\", a Chinese gaming term that refers to the perilous descent into poverty in the US. The idea, which took root quickly among users and influencers, is that America is a tough place to survive because a single stroke of bad luck can derail your life.\n\nThe term's popularity on social media is helped by the fact that it has been embraced by Chinese state media and the government. They have sought to portray the US as a decaying superpower because of inequality, a weak social safety net and a broken healthcare system.\n\nAccording to a commentary in state-owned Xinhua, the \"kill line\" meme \"underscores how far the lived reality can drift from the ideals once broadcast to the world\".\n\nIt's little wonder that Chinese authorities are pleased with Chinamaxxing.\n\n\"Chinese lifestyles increasingly gain global appeal, offer a steadier way of being,\" reads the headline of a Global Times piece about the trend.\n\nWhen asked about it at a press briefing earlier this month, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said a \"unique blend of history and modernity\" is making China increasingly appealing to foreigners.\n\nHe was \"happy\" to see foreigners experiencing the \"everyday life of ordinary Chinese people\".\n\nFor one, it's hard to know what Chinese people make of so many things because all public conversation and activity is heavily policed. Criticising the government is risky and protests are quickly quashed.\n\nTwo, there is a lot the memes making it to the West don't show. China's youth are facing an unemployment rate that sits at more than 15% and burning out from a gruelling work culture, yet sharing too much of their pessimism online could alert internet censors. They are worried about finding a home as the country's property crisis continues, and dating is no easier than anywhere else.\n\nPropping up breakneck delivery speeds are gig workers scrambling to hit deadlines. Many can relate to the hustle: in 2023, Beijing courier Hu Anyan's memoir about the relentless nature of gig work became a national bestseller.\n\n\"When I think of my American friends and tech people wandering through Shenzhen in awe, I also think of my own experience in Shenzhen,\" Wang says. \"Drinking a six yuan latte from Luckin Coffee, delivered on a scooter by someone like Hu Anyan, whose labour makes 'cool China' visible while remaining almost invisible themselves.\"\n\nPerhaps, if the fascination with China's successes continues, more of Chinese life will surface. But for now apple tea seems to be where it's at.\n\n\"Ever since I started boiling apples in my tea water my period cramps have completely gone,\" reads a comment on RedNote from an American user - one of the TikTok refugees still lingering on the app.\n\n\"We have so much still left to learn being Chinese.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Eunice Yang from BBC Chinese",

    "description": "The I-have-nothing-to-hide argument is a red herring; the real privacy argument is about who gets to choose what to share.",
    "fullText": "The term red herring is a figure of speech that we use to refer to an argument or plot device that creates a distraction from the real issue.\n\nHerrings aren't naturally red, but when are cured or smoked for consumption, they can take on a reddish colour. Smoked or cured herring is also very pungent, and this is allegedly the reason why we use the term today. An early 19th Century English political journalist referred to incorrect news reporting being like a red herring drawn across the escape route of a hare, in order to throw the hunting dogs off the trail.1\n\nAs a plot device, red herrings are common in stories and films. For example, in the original Star Wars trilogy, we are led to believe that there is potential for romance between Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, but that is a total red herring, as we find out later on.\n\nIn arguments, the term red herring is used to flag arguments that sound relevant to the discussion but are in fact not. A bad argument like that is called a logical fallacy, meaning it doesn't make any sense if you think about it carefully. A red herring is a logical fallacy that takes us off the trail leading towards the truth.\n\nIt's important to understand that the use of red herrings can be completely unintentional.\n\nDeductive reasoning means that if statements leading up to the conclusion are all true then the conclusion has to be true too. It can be worthwhile to write out arguments in this way.\n\nFor example, we can argue that humans are animals like this:\n\nwhere the symbol ∴ means therefore.\n\nHere is famous example of deductive reasoning about our mortality:\n\nLet's look at one more example:\n\nThis is a statement that sounds plausible, but it's a claim that can't be made, because we cannot read minds. The first premise says \"Freedom is important to all humans\", but, to be honest, I don't know if that is really true.\n\nEven though the conclusion rings true, there's a problem with one of the premises leading to the conclusion, makes the whole argument not sound.\n\nIn discussions about mass data collection and digital surveillance, people often respond with \"but I have nothing to hide...,\" as a way of saying that mass surveillance is acceptable to them.\n\nPro-privacy advocates are constantly breaking their heads on how to respond to this. The New Oil recently published a good blog post addressing some of the issues with saying that you have nothing to hide.\n\nHowever, here I want to show that the I-have-nothing-to-hide argument is a red herring. It's a statement that is related to the general topic of surveillance, but not necessarily relevant to to arguments about digital privacy.\n\nOften when you tell someone that we should worry about Big Tech companies or governments scanning and recording private data about us, people shrug and say \"I have nothing to hide,\" implying they are not worried about large scale surveillance.\n\nHere's the argument written out:\n\nWhen I presented these to my philosopher friend M., he showed me this argument:\n\nThis is a sound argument. The first statement is a conditional statement. \"When it rains\" is the condition, and the second half of that sentences, \"the streets get wet,\" is the result we see if that condition is met.\n\nIn logic, it is acceptable to either affirm the condition (i.e., \"It is raining\") or deny the result of the condition (i.e., \"The streets are not wet).\n\nHowever, it is not OK to do the opposite, namely deny the condition (\"It is not raining\") or affirm the result (\"the streets are wet\"), as then you'll get strange arguments like this:\n\nThis is a flawed conclusion, because other factors, like a broken fire hydrant, can also make the streets wet. Similarly, there is this:\n\nwhich shows another version of the same blind spot,, namely that other factors can make streets wet.\n\nIf we now go revisit the I-have-nothing-to-hide argument, we can see that the same thing is happening as in the bad rain arguments:\n\nThe second premise \"I have nothing to hide\" denies the condition \"If you have something to hide\".\n\nThe flaw here is that that you are not necessarily off the hook just because you have nothing to hide. There could be other reasons why digital mass surveillance might affect you negatively\n\nSo that takes care of the argument \"I have nothing to hide.\" Saying \"I have nothing to hide\" as a response to concerns about digital surveillance only addresses one way that digital can negatively affect people. Even if you really had nothing to hide, surveillance can still have a negative affect on you in other ways. Your fully transparent life doesn't immunise you from the many other bad things that come with surveillance, such as, for example, your statements or photos made 20 years ago being used against you in a current, different political climate.\n\nSo thank you, M., for your helpful insights!\n\nHowever, we are not done yet, because I started this blog by saying that the \"I have nothing to hide\" response is a red herring, meaning it has little to do with what the argument is really about. So in the final section, I'd like to show the true digital privacy argument.\n\nThis doesn't ignore that governments may need to use their power take private information from you, for example, when you are a suspected of a crime. In good governance there should be deterrents in place, such as warrants, to avoid governments abusing their power.\n\nGovernmental power and individual privacy is tricky. It gets tricker when governments use corporate surveillance tools, as has been extensively covered by 404Media in their recent reporting of Flock's license plate reader cameras.\n\nHowever, when it comes to corporate surveillance by Google, Meta, Amazon and others, it is clear that whether you have something to hide or not has little to do with who should get to decide about sharing (or taking) that private information.\n\nYou do. Even if you don't have anything to hide.\n\n3 Reasons Why Everyone Has Something to Hide\n\n404Media's reporting on Flock cameras\n\nIn picking apart these arguments, I got stuck and confused several times, but this article, and this sentence in particular, helped me stay on the right track:\n\nThe valid forms can be summarized as affirming the antecedent, or denying the consequent. The invalid forms are called traditionally \"denying the an-tecedent\" and \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nThere is a detailed and interesting discussion contesting the relationship between herring and hunting on the Wikipedia page about the term red herring.↩",

    "fullText": "When I was a mom of one, I nailed motherhood. I was calm and patient; my child was well-dressed; the car was pristine; the chores were completed; and there was very little shouting. But as a mom of two, I just can't parent to the same standards. Everything is messier, louder, more rushed, less organized, and good enough, just has to be enough.\n\nGoing from one child to two has, without a doubt, been one of, if not the hardest, adjustments of my entire life. One plus one does not equal two in this scenario. As a mom to a 1.5-year-old, a 3.5-year-old, a 16-year-old stepson, and two needy cats, it sometimes feels like I care for a dozen creatures.\n\nWhen I was pregnant with my second, I wasn't naive. I didn't think two would be easy. From the moment I brought my second home from the hospital, and he met my first with a cry that brought my first to tears as well, it has been a pinball game of crying, clinging, grabbing, and fighting.\n\nEach child seemingly has a different, urgent need that requires individual attention and the patience of someone who has had a full night's sleep. They both want \"mommy!\" all the time, especially when the other wants me.\n\nMost days, I'll be lucky to have a sip of water and finger brush my hair into a ponytail before the madness ensues. Once spotted, I'm bum-rushed as they joust for a prime spot on my lap or in my arms. Even with one on each leg with my legs spread as wide as they possibly can, they are still fighting over me, while likely trying to bat each other away. At 40 and 30 pounds each, holding both for more than a moment is back-breaking.\n\nCountless times since becoming a parent of two, I've wondered why I'm not better at this. I've always excelled at what I put my energy toward, but this has absolutely shattered me. Most of the time, I'm able to rescue myself from the rabbit hole of feeling like a failure by reminding myself that it feels hard because it IS hard.\n\nAdding a child when you already have one changes every dynamic in your life, including your relationship with your first child, and adds a whole new dynamic: your children's relationship with each other.\n\nCorners are cut, patience and sleep are limited, and the breaks you used to have when your partner had the other child no longer exist. Oh, did I forget to mention my partner? There's hardly any time for him. That relationship, the one that is most important in keeping everything afloat, is tested to the absolute limits.\n\nAs I write this, both kids are at day care. It's my one day a week without them (if they haven't contracted the latest day care bug), and I'm surrounded by chaos.\n\nThere's a tent in front of me and a play mop on top of what was once our living room table, now a receptacle for apple cores, half-eaten bananas, board books, sippy cups, tissues (some used), and a rotating selection of kitchen utensils.\n\nAmid all the clutter, I see the literal and figurative crumb trails my boys have left: crackers and playdough ground into the carpet, a red fire engine toy on the armchair of the sofa, a wooden spoon deposited in boots as one exited the front door that morning.\n\nDespite the messy, loud, hectic life I now have, I can't wait to pick them up from day care, even though I know it will be pandemonium from the moment they see me.",

While appearing in the files does not mean a person is associated with Epstein's crimes, some have nonetheless faced a public fallout by association.\n\nIn Wasserman's case, the documents revealed that the entertainment mogul flew on Epstein's jet with several people, including former US President Bill Clinton. He also exchanged emails with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking girls for Epstein. Wasserman's emails with Maxwell were dated 2003, long before police began to investigate Epstein and over a decade before police arrested Maxwell.\n\nWasserman issued an apology following the revelations, but a backlash from his roster of top talent had already begun. Singer Chappell Roan, Olympian Abby Wambach, and others said they intended to leave his agency over his association with Epstein.\n\n\"It was years before their criminal conduct came to light, and, in its entirety, consisted of one humanitarian trip to Africa and a handful of emails that I deeply regret sending,\" Wasserman wrote in the memo to staff on Friday. \"And I'm heartbroken that my brief contact with them 23 years ago has caused you, this company, and its clients so much hardship over the past days and weeks.\"\n\nRead the full memo Wasserman sent to his employees:",

    "title": "An open-source real-time motor driver for the Lego Orrery",
    "description": "A real-time motor driver mod kit for the LEGO 42179 Earth & Moon Orrery",
    "fullText": "I recently got my hands on the Lego Orrery set, which despite being an educational interactive toy is an impressively accurate functional model that simulates the orbital movements of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nIt features a manual crank that runs a gear system that simulates three motions simultaneously: the Earth orbiting the Sun, the Moon orbiting the Earth, and the Earth rotating on its tilted axis. While turning the crank manually is a fun way to visualize the seasons, and the moon's phases. I hated seeing the model sit idle on my shelf after I was done playing with it. So I began to wonder: is this model precise enough to be driven by a motor for real-time celestial tracking? As it turns out, it absolutely is!\n\nThe mod I've made consists of a custom PCB that can be directly mounted to the back of a NEMA17 stepper motor an can be attached to the LEGO set replacing the manual crank by only removing 5 LEGO pieces. I'm using esp32 as the brains and a tmc2208 stepper motor driver to silently drive the motor, there's a knob which can be used to go back or forward in time to see upcoming lunar phases, and a button that resets the model to the current local time. When left idle the Orrery Driver runs the motor to match the real time with an impressive rotation of \n\n 0.225∘\n\n every 2.7 minutes!\n\nAs always this project is fully open-source and I'm also planning to offer it as a plug & play electronics kit on Tindie as I have some PCB's and components left over from the project. Let me know if you're interested in the comments!\n\n📝NOTE\n\nYou can find the ready to print CAD files, PCB Gerbers and Arduino code along with the components list in the project repo.\n\nThe hardware consists of a ESP32-c3 super mini for it's small scale factor, a center detent potentiometer, a tactile button, RTC module and a tmc2208 silentstick stepper driver, and a nema 17 motor.\n\nSince the LEGO Orrery is already quite compact, there was no room to hide a protoboard. To keep the footprint as small as possible, I designed a custom PCB that mounts directly onto the motor.\n\nI've used JST-EH connectors on the pcb to make assembly easier, a dedicated power supply of 5V 2A is needed as the motor is power hungry when it accelerates. All the components are through hole so you can easliy solder them on your own with a basic soldering iron. Just make sure you clean any flux residue after soldering as the contacts are really close and can cause a short if not careful.\n\n📝NOTE\n\nI didn't use sketches/drawings for the freeform brass structure, I ended up with this just with trial&error. So in these instructions I'll tell you how I managed to solder the structure. But I can't provide dimensions, etc. since I also don't know them.\n\nThe 4 digit 7 segment display can be mounted directly with a regular JST cable connector, but I went for a freeform look just for the aesthetics. I've used 0.8mm brass wire and a small set of pliers to bend them into shape.\n\nNow we get to the fun stuff! How do we drive the motor so that it can match real-time? Through testing, I discovered that one full rotation of the crank rotates the Earth three times on its axis. This 1:3 ratio is the key to calculating the exact speed our stepper motor needs to maintain. But before we do that we need to know how many steps the motor takes to complete a single revolution (\n\n S\n\n ). To calculate this we use the following formula:\n\nWhere \n\n θstep\n\n is the step angle of the motor and \n\n MS\n\n is Microstepping if you have it enabled. This will give us the steps per revolution (\n\n S\n\n ).\n\nIn my case the motor has \n\n 0.9∘\n\n step angle, and the stepper motor driver I'm using comes with \n\n 14\n\n Microstepping as default, which gives me \n\n S=1600\n\n steps per revolution!\n\nNow going back to the initial calculation of the \n\n 1:3\n\n ratio, we convert the total time of 3 days into \n\n 4,320\n\n minutes and divide that by our \n\n 1,600\n\n steps. This gives us exactly \n\n 2.7\n\n minutes per step. Which means that, the motor only needs to trigger one step every \n\n 2.7\n\n minutes to keep the model in sync with Earth's rotation!\n\nDownload the code from the repository and upload it to your ESP32 board via USB using the Arduino IDE, if this is the first time you are uploading code to your ESP32-C3 you might have to put the board in to download mode by holding the boot and reset buttons at the same time and then releasing the reset button after a few seconds.\n\nThe display will prompt you to calibrate the orrery when you first plug it in, use the knob to move the orrery in to the winter solstace position as shown in the LEGO manual:\n\nSimply press the button after you align the orrery and the orrery will start moving into it's real-time position!\n\n📝NOTE\n\nYou only have to calibrate the motor once when you plug it in first so it knows where the gears are, once set there's the RTC module alon with the EEPROM of the ESP32 is used to save the state of the motor to keep track of time in case of a power loss. So you only have to calibrate it once!\n\nAnd with that the build is finished! This project was really fun to build, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!\n\nNext:\n Shine-through Halloween PCB Pins",

    "description": "The seven Western states that depend on the Colorado River have missed a deadline for the second time to agree on a plan addressing record drought and water shortages.",
    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — The seven Western states that depend on the Colorado River missed a deadline for the second time Saturday to agree on a plan addressing record drought and water shortages.\n\nArizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo released a joint statement calling on Upper Basin states to offer more concessions. Those states include Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.\n\n“The Colorado River is essential to our communities and economies, and our states have conserved large volumes of water in recent years to stabilize the basin’s water supplies for years to come,” the governors said. “Our stance remains firm and fair: all seven basin states must share in the responsibility of conservation.”\n\nArizona, California and Nevada have offered to decrease Colorado River allocation by 27%, 10% and 17%, respectively, according to those states.\n\nColorado Sen. John Hickenlooper. who helped negotiate a river contingency plan in 2019 as governor, called the situation in the Colorado Basin “dire,” pointing to the state’s low snowpack.\n\n“If we don’t address this problem together –- head-on and fast –- our communities, farms, and economies will suffer. The best path forward is the one we take together. Litigation won’t solve the problem of this long-term aridification,” Hickenlooper said in a statement.\n\nJohn Entsminger, the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, also expressed frustration at the lack of progress.\n\n“The actions we have taken over the past two-plus decades are less about raising Lake Mead’s elevation than they are about protecting ourselves if things go from bad to worse,” Entsminger said in a statement.\n\nThe states previously let pass a November deadline set by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to devise a strategy to face water shortages after this year, when current guidelines will expire.\n\nOver 40 million people across these states along with Mexico and Native American tribes rely on Colorado River water. The river is crucial to farming as well as water and electricity for millions of homes and businesses. Much of the water starts out as winter mountain snowfall in the Upper Basin, which amasses far more that way than it consumes. Lower Basin states, including agriculture-heavy regions, are bigger consumers.\n\nMajor cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, are also big water consumers. Chronic overuse, drought and rising temperatures linked to climate change have lessened water flows.\n\nHow the water is allocated — especially in dry spells — and conserved has been the center of agreements among the states for decades. The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on water amounts that doesn’t exist today, especially with the long-term drought.\n\nThe current round of negotiations among states have been going on over two years.\n\nIf no consensus can be reached, the federal government could step in and devise a plan that leaves parties dissatisfied and could even result in litigation.\n\nScientists recently found snow cover and snow depth in the West are at their lowest in decades. Some areas have seen their warmest December through early February. Normally, snow cover this time of year spans 460,000 square miles — about the size of California, Utah, Idaho and Montana. But, this year it is only California-sized, about 155,000 square miles, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",

    "fullText": "The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.\n\nWe'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.\n\nInterviews will drop on weekends across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 00:15 GMT on Sunday, 15 February (and after Sportscene in Scotland).\n\nWhen Roberto Martinez first joined Wigan in 1995, he probably did not even dream that nearly 20 years later he would manage them to FA Cup victory.\n\nBut that is exactly how it panned out for the Spaniard, who masterminded their 1-0 victory over Manchester City in the 2013 final.\n\nThe Latics were also relegated from the Premier League that season, and within weeks of their Wembley success Martinez had joined Everton.\n\nThree years later he was sacked - and his two jobs since have been at international level - first with Belgium, and now Portugal.\n\nMartinez, 52, has been in his current role since January 2023, guiding Portugal to their second Nations League title when they beat Spain last year.\n\nLess than a month after that match, Portugal mourned the death of forward Diogo Jota, who died along with his brother Andre Silva in a car crash in northern Spain. Martinez said the team \"want to honour his memory every day\".\n\nIn this extended interview with Kelly Somers, Martinez spoke about a range of things, including winning the FA Cup, Belgium's 'golden generation' and why he has never drunk alcohol.\n\nKelly Somers: Let's start with football. Why football?\n\nRoberto Martinez: For me, it's a way of living. I was born in a family that was breathing football. My dad was mad about football. My dad was a coach at that time - a local team. I would be the mascot and I've got pictures where probably at the age of two and three, I would be listening to the team talks, and I would be in that environment of the dressing room. So that, for me, was a safe zone. I thought that all the kids did that. I thought that was the normal thing to do. And then I realised that it was the opposite. Not many kids had the opportunity to be in a team talk of the local team!\n\nKelly: Was that local team the first proper team you played for?\n\nRoberto: Yes - under-nines. In school in Spain, you play futsal. As a young student, you play with your futsal team in school on Friday and then on Saturday you play with a football team.\n\nKelly: Was there a point where you thought, 'OK, I could make this'... when you were looking around maybe at the other other kids and thought, 'oh, I'm at a good level here'?\n\nRoberto: At 16, if you want to play football, you have to go to a more professional standard. I got the opportunity to go to Zaragoza - move to the big city, study there - and then you see your parents coming to watch the game at the weekend... almost a ritual.\n\nKelly: When you look back on your career, which club do you feel was where you had your most success? Or you enjoyed the most?\n\nRoberto: I enjoyed them all. They were all different, they were all challenging. I think in 1995 when the Bosman ruling came out [enabling football players to leave clubs at the end of their contracts for free], we were the first three Spaniards to come to the UK.\n\nKelly: The 'Three Amigos', weren't you?\n\nRoberto: The 'Three Amigos', yes! I think as a human being, we're always fearful... we don't like change. I was always the opposite. My answer would be: 'Why not?' So... 'Would you like to go to the UK without speaking a word of English and play football?' My answer was: 'Why not?'\n\nKelly: So you couldn't speak any English when you came over?\n\nRoberto: No, no. We arrived the first day at Wigan and I remember the press officer saying: 'Would you mind to do a little bit... a couple of words with the local media?' I said: 'I would love to, but I don't speak a word of English!' And those are the challenges that they really... they make you as a person.\n\nKelly: Let's talk just quickly about that FA Cup final, because that's still one of the greatest shocks... one of the greatest FA Cup finals in history. How do you reflect upon that all these years later?\n\nRoberto: With a lot of pride. Dreams can really happen in the FA Cup. And I think that game... you play the champions of England - Man City - with all the stars. The odds are against the underdog. I think everybody likes it. I always found out that we had so many neutral fans that day... that's what happens in the FA Cup. But to actually perform and deserve to win was very special.\n\nKelly: At what point did you think, 'management is for me'? Was it always management?\n\nRoberto: Always. Always, yeah, because my dad was managing. I thought that was the best.\n\nKelly: Did you almost envisage being a manager before a player?\n\nRoberto: Yes, because I never saw my dad play. And it was fascinating because when I came to the UK in 1995, straight away they tell you there is no 'I' in team. You have to adjust to the group and you have to do whatever it takes to be with the group. The reality doesn't work like that. It's the opposite. You have to address the 'I' before you can create a team. And sometimes you are in the corner of a room thinking... completely different culture, different background, and you expect it to perform without having help to be settled, to feel that you are valuable. There are many aspects that I learned from my own experience of being away from home. Without me knowing it, that was preparing me for that side. You need to get... a team to be together, to have the same goal and to be able to perform on the pitch.\n\nKelly: Other than your dad, who's had the biggest influence on Roberto Martinez the manager?\n\nRoberto: I was intrigued by Johan Cruyff - the way he managed Barcelona. He came in, he changed completely the way that the game was played. I think many, many people in the last 100 years have influenced the game, but I don't think anybody has influenced the game the way that Johan Cruyff did it, because it changed. It was more a technical game, it was a possession-based game, it was about a numerical advantage. And then you created the ones that didn't follow that way of football - they had to find a way to counter that style. I followed many other managers... I think what John Toshack did when he went to Real Sociedad and then went to Real Madrid. I love Pacho Maturana - what he did with the Colombian team. Arrigo Sacchi - so structured and rigorous and methodic. I always enjoyed how managers get their message across to the players and in a different way.\n\nKelly: Have you ever had an opportunity to go and watch any of those managers? We've spoken to Andoni Iraola and Brendan Rodgers this year, and they talked about managers that they went and learned from. Have you had anyone like that - any mentors or anything?\n\nRoberto: I was just watching games. I liked to watch a game and I tried to double-guess: 'How did that happen? How did you take the risk to get to the player to understand what you're trying?' I never went to see anybody work, but I followed many World Cups. I started managing in the Premier League in 2009. Every summer with my wife, I would invite her to go to South Africa first, and then Poland, and then Brazil, and then France. Our holidays were following the big tournaments!\n\nKelly: So she thought she was going on a lovely, exotic holiday, but she was actually going for a tournament...\n\nRoberto: I think the first time, yeah. The first time.\n\nRoberto: And then she knew. I still owe her. From this day, I still owe her a nice honeymoon - because the honeymoon when we got married was South Africa, and she was delighted. She didn't realise that it was the World Cup!\n\nKelly: You've obviously seen management from both sides as well - in terms of club management and international management. How do the two differ?\n\nRoberto: Coaching in the Premier League is about tomorrow and it was about preparing the game that is in front of you, preparing the players so they can make a difference in winning the game. International football is about trying to find out the best talent and then to make it in a structured way, to make it competitive - and you've got three days to do that. That's very different to doing it in a club. Everything is more tactically synchronised - everything can be more methodical. International football is about creating good mood, creating a sense of pride, creating high-performance teams that they follow in their dreams because when you represent your national team, it affects your family... the neighbours. If you win, the whole country wins. When you lose, the whole country loses. It's a completely different way of enjoying the game. I was fascinated about being involved in a World Cup - that was one of my dreams as a kid. The first World Cup I remember - 1978, Argentina - Mario Kempes, scoring in the final, then 1982 was in Spain, so it was a big impact. So for me, the move to international football was just to experience a World Cup. Then I enjoyed it so much that I stayed almost 10 seasons now.\n\nKelly: Let's discuss your time with Belgium, because what an incredible group of players you had there - the 'golden generation', they said. What challenges did that job bring with it and what did you get from that period?\n\nRoberto: First and foremost was to cope with that tag of 'golden generation'. It wasn't a pressure that the players were not used to because obviously you're talking about the players that were in the most demanding dressing rooms. From Eden Hazard to Kevin de Bruyne, Dries Mertens, Romelu Lukaku, Axel Witsel, Jan Vertonghen, Thomas Vermaelen, Vincent Kompany, Thibaut Courtois, Yannick Carrasco... you're talking about the generation. But I think we managed to focus on, 'OK, let's be as good as we can together and let's become the golden generation.'\n\nI think that was a beautiful journey to go to the World Cup in 2018. After seven games, we won six. We only lost the semi-final against France 1-0 - there were little margins - but then we came third by winning the bronze medal in the last game. That is the moment that it became the golden generation. At that moment, it was a shift into what we could do from that point on and that team stayed four years consecutively with the number one ranking. It was a very interesting time to try to get a focus of everybody having that common goal that was trying to make history for Belgian football and it was really, really enjoyable.\n\nKelly: I always ask in these interviews for my interviewee to tell me a game from their career, playing or managerial, that they wish they could relive...\n\nRoberto: I think if I could relive a game it would be the semi-final with Belgium against France because we lost 1-0. I felt we were the better team - we had almost 60% possession - and it was just decided by one action... and if it is one game that I could relive to try to change it, it would be that one.\n\nKelly: Do you think about it a lot, or are you able to just park it now?\n\nRoberto: No, sometimes I like to think about it. If we were going to play it again with the same situation, what could have been done differently? And that helps. I think the margins are so small. You've got the best players possible of two generations and I think you can learn from already having the experience of being in a game like that.\n\nKelly: And you've not got a bad crop of players now at Portugal, have you? You've already won the Nations League and what an opportunity potentially ahead for you. The pressure is going to be there again.\n\nRoberto: But it's an enjoyable pressure because it is true... we arrived in Portugal - huge tradition, always created big players through the history now that we celebrated the moment that Eusebio won the Ballon d'Or in 1965. You've got players like Luis Figo, Joao Pinto, Rui Costa... it's a tradition in Portugal, but they won everything apart from the World Cup. We got an incredible commitment from the players because this is probably a mixture of four generations. You've got the captain [Cristiano Ronaldo], who is 41 years old, to the youngest player who was born the year the captain made his debut for the national team. So, we're looking forward. The first step was to qualify. We did that and I always believe that there has never been a winning team that arrives to the tournament. The winning team becomes the winning team in the tournament.\n\nKelly: That captain, of course, is Cristiano Ronaldo. What's it like managing him?\n\nRoberto: Very easy, because of his high standards, his expectations of how the work should be done and his commitment to the game. He truly is an example of what you should do to represent Portugal and the national team. And now he's adapted, obviously, after 21 years in the national team - he's adjusted. He's a goalscorer, he's an important player for us, and it's the player that he is now that is important for me. As a national team coach, a player that has scored 25 goals in the last 30 international games... it's not that he's playing because of what he's done in the past, it's what he's done now.\n\nKelly: The question everyone's asking at the moment is: 'How long can he go on for?' As someone that's seen him close up, how long do you think he can keep playing for?\n\nRoberto: Well, we got all the stats. If you were going to analyse a player that is dropping at physical level, that's not the case. His physical stats are of a player that could go on and on and on. I think it's more a question of when he'll feel that is the right time. I think he's a player that is very critical with himself. When he doesn't see that he can help the team, he'll be the one that will decide when to stop.\n\nKelly: You've got two girls and you're married to a Scottish lady, is that correct?\n\nKelly: Is that from your time in Scotland?\n\nRoberto: In Motherwell, yeah. That was the best thing!\n\nKelly: So that must be quite the culture kind of mix at home?\n\nRoberto: Especially when you are the international team coach of Portugal playing against Scotland. I think it's been four times now that we played with Belgium against Scotland. Obviously with my wife, it's not a problem. It's more the in-laws - it's difficult for them to support a team that is different than Scotland! But, no, that's part of the fun. I'm very, very lucky and probably that's the biggest achievement that I want to have in my life is to be the best father that I can be and the best husband that I can be. Everything else is going to be just part of the journey.\n\nKelly: Tell me something about yourself that might surprise me.\n\nRoberto: I've never tasted alcohol.\n\nRoberto: Yeah. And it was a promise. When I was 16 and I had the opportunity to go to Zaragoza, I went to my dad and I said: 'I really want to go.' And I said: 'What do you think?' He said: Well, it's the worst thing you could do because you're going to be very young - 16. You're going to be away from home and the first thing you're going to do is start drinking, start smoking, you're going to give up your studies.' And I said: 'Well, I promise you, I'll do my degree, I'll never drink, I'll never smoke.' And then since that day, that was my commitment, so I'm 52 now and I'm proud to say that I never touched a drop of alcohol.\n\nKelly: If you were to win the World Cup next summer...?\n\nRoberto: Probably, yes, I would be quite happy to make another commitment!\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "When James Trafford arrived back at Manchester City in June for a fee of about £30m, he would have been hoping to emerge as the club's number-one goalkeeper.\n\nAnd he started this season in that role, featuring in City's first three Premier League games of the campaign.\n\nBut Gianluigi Donnarumma's arrival ripped up the pecking order.\n\nCity seized their chance to bring in one of the world's best keepers when the Italian became surplus to requirements at Paris St-Germain on summer deadline day.\n\nDonnarumma has played 30 matches for City since then, with Trafford having had to settle for domestic cup games - plus one Champions League appearance.\n\nAfter keeping a clean sheet in the FA Cup fourth-round win over Salford City on Saturday, Trafford admitted the current situation is not what he had imagined.\n\nWhen asked about being City's cup goalkeeper, Trafford told the BBC: \"It wasn't what I expected coming into the season...\n\n\"It's the reality and I have to give it my best shot. It's the situation I'm in. We train every day but making saves, it's good fun.\"\n\nTrafford played 45 games last season as Burnley won promotion to the Premier League, conceding just 16 goals in the Championship in the process.\n\nThe 23-year-old then decided it was time to tackle unfinished business at City, who he had left in 2023 in search of regular playing time.\n\nBut the arrival of Champions League winner Donnarumma, who is only 26, has dented Trafford's hopes of making a mark this time around.\n\nFrom 'demoralising' 8-0 defeat to pushing Man City all the way\n\nGuehi scores first Man City goal in win over Salford\n\nWith Ederson regressing last season, City boss Pep Guardiola had clearly plotted to overhaul his goalkeeping department.\n\nRe-signing Trafford from Burnley in June seemed the sensible option - a keeper with plenty of experience for his age who had spent six years in the club's academy and impressed for England's Under-21s.\n\nTrafford had also been picked as part of England's initial 33-man squad for Euro 2024 - although he did not make the final cut - and a role as City's number one could have bolstered his senior international prospects.\n\nBut he has not featured in a Three Lions squad since November and a spot at this summer's World Cup now appears to be unlikely amid his lack of game time.\n\n\"I feel sorry for Trafford,\" former City goalkeeper Nicky Weaver told BBC Radio Manchester in December. \"When he signed, he probably thought he was going to be number one.\n\n\"We don't exactly know what he was told, but when you get the opportunity to bring someone in of Donnarumma's quality and at his age as well, for a relatively moderate fee, you have to take that opportunity. I feel for Trafford, I really like him.\n\n\"It's the life of a goalkeeper. I've been number one, number two and three. It's really difficult. You don't see a way into the team for him.\n\n\"He just has to stick in there, he can learn a lot off Donnarumma but I'm sure he would learn if he was playing every week.\"\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Scotland delivered a magnificent Calcutta Cup triumph for under-pressure head coach Gregor Townsend, according to captain Sione Tuipulotu.",
    "fullText": "Scotland delivered a magnificent Calcutta Cup triumph for under-pressure head coach Gregor Townsend after a week of \"guilt\", says captain Sione Tuipulotu.\n\nOff the back of an opening Six Nations defeat by Italy in torrential Rome rain which triggered a sharpened focus on Townsend's tenure, Scotland's title chances were on the line as they welcomed in-form England to Murrayfield.\n\nAnd they delivered a spectacular opening burst, racing into a 17-0 lead inside 15 minutes, one which they never looked like surrendering.\n\nTownsend's side played with pace and verve as Finn Russell stamped his mark on this famous old fixture.\n\nThe Scotland fly-half set up Huw Jones' first try with a gorgeous tap-on pass before spreading the play right and then left for Jamie Ritchie to go over.\n\nEven when England hit back through Henry Arundell - who was subsequently sent off for a second yellow card offence - Scotland continued to play with freedom and confidence and they added a third after Ellis Genge failed to gather Russell's chip over the top and Ben White capitalised.\n\nThe visitors, having won their past 12 Tests, came back into the contest after half-time but Scotland stood strong in defence and scored a bonus-point try through Jones after George Ford's drop-goal attempt was charged down.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud,\" Tuipulotu said.\n\n\"To go through what we went through last week really hurt and we understood because we deserved it. Ultimately Italy were better than us.\n\n\"We really felt like our backs were against the wall and we showed up today.\n\n\"I felt guilty. Head coaching is a hard job because when it is going well you get all the positives but when it is not going well you get all of the criticism.\n\n\"We got behind our coach this week. I'm proud of the boys for getting behind our coach and delivering a performance.\"\n\nScotland Rugby Podcast: Reaction from a jubilant Murrayfield\n\nScotland now head to Spain to recover before their third match of the championship against Wales next weekend.\n\nTuipulotu says they will do everything in their power to kick on from this impressive victory.\n\n\"I want to enjoy tonight with my team-mates but make no mistake we'll be all hands on deck,\" the Glasgow Warriors centre said.\n\n\"We'll prepare to the best of our abilities to back up this performance.\"\n\nAnd former Scotland skipper John Barclay says they have to do that if they want to move forwards as a team.\n\n\"They need to back it up,\" he said on ITV.\n\n\"Sione and Gregor have spoken about that, so we know that's what their focus will be. The very best sides, the drop-off isn't as big.\"\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win\n\nTownsend 'very proud of team' - relive how Scotland humbled England to regain Calcutta Cup\n\nIt has been a tough spell for Townsend, perhaps the toughest of his nine-year tenure at the helm.\n\nThree defeats in the four Tests before this match, as well as ongoing links to a full-time role with Newcastle Red Bulls post-World Cup were hanging over the former fly-half, with some fans and pundits suggesting he had taken the national team as far as he could.\n\nBut he says that first-half display was some of the finest rugby he has seen from a Scotland team.\n\n\"After 20 minutes I thought that was some of the best rugby we've ever played,\" he told ITV.\n\n\"It's all you want as a coach and then to see the effort in the second half, we became a team that would fight for each other and the supporters.\n\n\"We know that rugby brings out the best in us, being very aggressive and playing at speed. I thought that was one of Finn Russell's best games for Scotland and the work-rate of our forwards was superb.\"\n\nScotland have now won five of the past six Calcutta Cup matches, and it was inches from being six - Russell's missed conversion denying the Scots at Twickenham last year.\n\n\"I thought they made England look pretty mediocre,\" former Scotland prop Peter Wright said.\n\n\"What frustrates me about Scotland is they can give you a performance like this, but they can also give you a performance like they did in Italy.\n\n\"The players deserve all the plaudits.\"\n\nTownsend dismissed the notion that Scotland only deliver their best performances against England.\n\n\"We have played some of our best rugby against England and that's great,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know why people see a negative in that, it's our biggest game. It seems to be a narrative that it's a negative that we do well in this fixture. We only see positives, and I reminded our players how well we've done in this fixture.\n\n\"I'm very proud of the team. I was proud of them last week, we went 29 phases in monsoon conditions, starting from our own try line to try and win that game.\n\n\"You ask so much of the players during the week and they put it in at the weekend. If they don't turn up with a victory it's not down to their energy and effort. I was proud of them last week and I'm proud of them this week.\"",

    "fullText": "Ireland head coach Andy Farrell says Saturday's gritty win over Italy in the Six Nations \"showed that we're able to back ourselves\".\n\nFarrell's side started their Six Nations with a humbling defeat by France and they trailed Italy by five points at the break in Dublin.\n\nHowever, tries from Jack Conan and Robert Baloucoune put them in front and the Irish defence held firm to win 20-13 despite late Italian pressure.\n\nFarrell said the \"character\" shown by his side in the second half was \"the bigger-picture stuff\".\n\n\"We were playing against an Italian side who were never going to go away, and recent history shows us that,\" Farrell said.\n\n\"They were trying to batter the door down at the end there, so the resilience we showed to win the game was fantastic to see.\n\n\"The character shown to come back and have the courage to play the type of rugby we played was very encouraging.\"\n\nFarrell said Ireland had \"too many errors\" at points in the game but was pleased with how his side responded to the France defeat.\n\nFly-half Sam Prendergast had a difficult afternoon in Dublin and he was replaced by Jack Crowley on 55 minutes.\n\nThe Munster fly-half kicked five points in a strong showing off the bench, and Farrell thought Crowley was \"outstanding\" despite a late scuffed penalty kick to touch that ended the game by going out of play in the in-goal area when Ireland were chasing a try with the clock in the red.\n\n\"I'm actually gutted for him and he normally wouldn't do that,\" Farrell said.\n\n\"It was a bit of a shank, but it won't be the overriding thought that I take from Jack's game - I thought he was outstanding when he came on.\"\n\nFarrell said he was \"delighted\" for player of the match Baloucoune, who scored what was ultimately the decisive try on his Six Nations debut for Ireland.\n\n\"He's had a few caps before, but it was stop-start for him when the talent is there for everyone to see when he puts the Ulster jersey on,\" Farrell added.\n\n\"It's very pleasing for him, and for the rest of us, to see him believe in himself and back himself, not only beating people and scoring tries but beating people in the air and his defensive decision-making.\"",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.\n\nThe women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.\n\nSuch arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThey are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.\n\nOther activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.\n\n“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.\n\nSo far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.\n\nNazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.\n\nThe protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.\n\nSecurity forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.\n\nGholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran’s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters “terrorists” and calling for fast-tracked punishments.\n\nSince then, “detentions have been very widespread because it’s like a whole suffocation of society,” said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.\n\nThe Nakhii sisters, 25-year-old Nyusha and 37-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.\n\nOther people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.\n\nAtila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.\n\nAuthorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters' relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.\n\nIn past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.\n\n“The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been,” Barzin said.\n\nDespite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.\n\nThe Writers’ Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.”\n\nIt also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.\n\nA national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. “Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children’s names public,” it said in a statement.\n\nA spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.\n\n“Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”\n\nBar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran’s state-sanctioned doctors council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.\n\nAnger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.\n\nThe Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.\n\nIran’s theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nStill, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran’s leadership “for the first time is afraid of being overthrown.”\n\nThis story corrects ages for Nyusha and Mona.",

    "fullText": "Federal authorities announced an investigation Friday into two immigration officers who appeared to have made untruthful statements under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis last month.\n\nIt is among at least five shootings in which initial descriptions by the immigration officials were later contradicted by video evidence. Those included the fatal Minneapolis shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, where bystander video quickly raised questions about how they were initially described.\n\nThe probe Friday came hours after a federal judge dismissed felony assault charges against two Venezuelan men who were accused of beating an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer with a broom handle and a snow shovel on Jan. 14. The officer, who is not named in court filings, fired a single shot from a handgun that struck one of the men, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, in the thigh.\n\nIn an unusual reversal, prosecutors asked to dismiss the cases because they said new video evidence contradicted allegations made against the men in a criminal complaint and at a hearing last month.\n\nHere is a look at how the five shootings were initially described and what was later learned:\n\nDate and location: Jan. 14, 2026, in Minneapolis\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the immigration officer was “ambushed” by Sosa-Celis and others, and fired a “defensive shot” out of fear for his life. “What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,” she said.\n\nWhat came out later: Investigators have not released the new evidence that led charges to be dropped, but cracks were already apparent in a Jan. 21 court hearing. The immigration officer’s testimony recounting the moments before the shooting differed significantly from that of the defendants and three eyewitnesses. Available video evidence did not support the officer’s account of being assaulted with a broom and shovel.\n\nDate and location: Jan. 7, 2026, in Minneapolis\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle.\" She said the immigration agent shot “defensively” to protect himself and the people around him. Good died of gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nWhat came out later: Videos filmed from multiple angles challenged the administration’s narrative. Shortly before the shooting Good is seen at the wheel of her SUV that is parked diagonally on a street. She tells an immigration officer, “I'm not mad at you.”\n\nSeconds later, another immigration officer grabs at the driver’s side door while Good’s wife urges her to “drive, baby, drive.” It’s unclear in the videos if the SUV makes contact with ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who shoots while standing in front of the vehicle and then twice more while quickly moving to the driver's side of the SUV as it pulls forward.\n\nDate and location: Jan. 24, 2026, in Minneapolis\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Pretti approached Border Patrol officers with a handgun and he “violently resisted” when they tried to disarm him. An agent feared for his life and fired defensive shots, she said. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene. Border Patrol senior official Greg Bovino claimed Pretti intended to “massacre law enforcement,\" and Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller described him as “a would-be assassin.\"\n\nWhat came out later: None of the half-dozen bystander videos collected by investigators showed Pretti brandishing his gun, which he had a permit to carry. The videos showed Pretti was holding his mobile phone as a masked Border Patrol officer opened fire.\n\nIn a tense hearing Thursday in Washington, Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky made leaders tasked with carrying out Trump’s mass deportation agenda watch a video of the shooting while he repeatedly scrutinized the forceful tactics used by immigration agents. Paul argued that Pretti posed no threat to the agents and said it was clear from the video that he was “retreating at every moment.”\n\nDate and location: Sept. 12, 2025, in suburban Chicago\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: Homeland Security officials said federal agents were pursuing a man with a history of reckless driving who entered the country illegally. They alleged Silverio Villegas González drove at officers and dragged one with his car. DHS said the officer fired because he feared for his life and was hospitalized with “serious injuries.\"\n\nWhat came out later: Body camera videos from local police contradicted the Trump administration’s account. Footage showed the agent who shot Villegas González walking around afterward and dismissing his own injuries as “nothing major.”\n\nAn autopsy made public in November declared Villegas González's death a homicide. The report showed he was shot at “close range,” with wounds to his neck and fingers.\n\nDate and location: Oct. 14, 2025, in Chicago\n\nWhat federal officials said initially: A DHS news release asserted that Martinez and the driver of another car involved in a crash with a Border Patrol officer were “domestic terrorists.” An FBI agent said in court documents that she was chasing the Border Patrol vehicle and drove at one of the officers after they got out of the vehicle. The officer was forced to open fire, the FBI agent alleged, striking Martinez seven times. She was treated at a hospital and arrested on felony assault charges.\n\nWhat came out later: Videos emerged that her attorneys said showed agent Charles Exum steering his SUV into her truck.\n\nIn a text message presented during a Nov. 5 hearing, Exum appeared to brag about his marksmanship. “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,\" the text read.\n\nThe case against her was dismissed.",

    "description": "Burnley manager Scott Parker is under increasing pressure as the Premier League side are dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Mansfield.",
    "fullText": "League One Mansfield produced an FA Cup fairytale to remember at Turf Moor on Saturday, but for Premier League strugglers Burnley, it was another afternoon to forget.\n\nLouis Reed's 80th-minute free-kick into the top corner of the Clarets' goal was a cue for 3,500 travelling Mansfield fans to erupt in sheer delight.\n\nFor the home faithful, it had the opposite affect - boos and jeers started coming from large sections at Turf Moor, and at full-time it became a cacophony of discontent.\n\nWith just two wins in their past 19 games in all competitions and nine points adrift of safety in the Premier League, an FA Cup run represented the last bit of hope in what has been a dismal return to the top flight.\n\n\"The pressure is on Scott Parker from a certain section of the Burnley fans, they think his time is up,\" Chris Sutton said on BBC Final Score.\n\nThe teams immediately around Burnley in the Premier League table have all changed their managers this season. Could they be next?\n\nLosing to the team 13th in English football's third tier represents a new low in Burnley's season just as renewed optimism was starting to creep in.\n\nTheir remarkable 3-2 comeback win at Crystal Palace on Wednesday was their first victory in 16 Premier League games. The gloom started to lift slightly.\n\nParker's side showed real fight and spirit at Selhurst Park, which made his decision to make nine changes to his team for the visit of Mansfield all the more baffling.\n\n\"When you don't go through to the next round there will always be questions asked about that [team selection] but I don't think that was the main factor today,\" Parker told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We lacked a little something in those final moments. That was where we have fallen way short today.\"\n\nBurnley are not the first, nor will they be the last, Premier League side to ring the changes for a cup game against lower opposition.\n\nBut having been dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Cardiff City back in September, the FA Cup was the supporters' only chance to distract themselves from looming relegation.\n\n\"It is embarrassing, the changes he made. Play your strongest team. He made nine changes, and the second half was embarrassing,\" former Burnley defender David Unsworth said on BBC Radio Lancashire.\n\n\"It is an embarrassing afternoon for Burnley. It gives the owner a decision to make now. He has to listen to the fans, they are not happy.\n\n\"For the first time I have witnessed all home ends of the stadium booing and disgruntlement. The owner has a decision to make.\"\n\nChairman Alan Pace, the leader of the club's owners ALK Capital, is not the most popular at Turf Moor either at the moment.\n\nThis week he angered fans when, during an interview with BBC Football Focus, he dismissed fan concerns as coming from those who \"just play this game on a computer somewhere\".\n\nHe went on to liken those same fans to three-year-old toddlers having a tantrum.\n\nPace used Saturday's programme notes to clarify his words, writing: \"I did not intend for my words to upset, but I did mean what I was trying to say which was that, just because some are upset, does not mean that things are dire and without hope.\"\n\nMany Burnley fans will be hoping Pace calls time on Parker's spell in charge, though the former Premier League midfielder said he is confident is his own position at the club.\n\n\"I am very comfortable in my position at this present moment in time. We have lost a game of football today against a team we should be beating,\" Parker told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We had numerous chances. Of course you are always going to judge a result and today is a bad one, we take the flak for that, the team and myself.\"\n\nLeague One Mansfield shock Burnley in FA Cup\n\nWhile Burnley's failures were significant, it's important not to underplay Mansfield's achievement.\n\nThe Stags have eliminated a top-flight side from the FA Cup for the first time since February 1969, and will now play in the fifth round for the first time since 1974-75.\n\nDespite falling behind early on, Nigel Clough's side dug deep and hung in - Kyle Knoyle's heroic goalline clearance at 1-0 was typical of their spirit.\n\nWhen their chances came, they took them. Rhys Oates headed in the equaliser shortly after the break, before captain Reed produced a free-kick his club's fans will never forget.\n\n\"As soon as it left my boot I felt it going in. I have been working on them throughout the week. The lads said, 'This is your moment, go and take it'. Thankfully, I did,\" said Reed.\n\n\"It shows what a group we have got. The draws we keep getting are big ones. I felt we were always in the game even when we were 1-0 down at half-time.\n\n\"I think it's a cliche, whoever we get in the next round, we will go into that with the same energy as this one.\"\n\nSutton said: \"It's an amazing story and Nigel Clough, at the helm, has done a brilliant job at Mansfield.\n\n\"To think Mansfield came from behind against Premier League opposition, they kept on peppering Burnley's goal, but the free-kick from Louis Reed deserves to win any cup tie.\"\n\nWin a cup tie it did - but it could also end up costing Parker his job.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "A medallist with Team GB in 2014, bobsleigher Joel Fearon is preparing for his third Winter Olympics after coming out of retirement to compete for Jamaica.",
    "fullText": "\"The fastest man in the UK this year and he's not even going to the Olympics.\"\n\nThat was the line belted out by the commentator as Joel Fearon stunned onlookers by running the 100m in under 10 seconds - breaking one of the most revered barriers in sport.\n\nFrustratingly, the performance came just after the cut-off date to qualify him to represent Team GB at Rio 2016.\n\nA decade on, the 37-year-old is at his third Winter Olympics, but his first for Jamaica's bobsleigh team, who he came out of retirement for last year.\n\nHe remembers that day in 2016 as one that changed his life.\n\n\"I don't know if I ever believed that I could do something like that,\" he told BBC Local Radio.\n\n\"It was surreal for a long time because I wasn't one of the British superstar sprinters.\n\n\"But there I was, running sub-10, number one in the country and I remember thinking anything can happen.\"\n\nOnly four British men have ever run faster on UK soil than his time of 9.96 seconds to win the England Athletics Championships in Bedford that day.\n\nRunning fast was just one piece of the jigsaw for Coventry-born Fearon, as he was trying to make ends meet, juggling between work and bobsleigh training.\n\n\"I've done all sorts of jobs, at one point, I was a pizza delivery man,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I would run Diamond Leagues in the daytime. In the evening, I'm off delivering my local pizzas, just whatever needed to be done.\"\n\nAthletics was Fearon's first sporting passion, but his bobsleigh career has been unique.\n\nHe has competed for Great Britain, Switzerland and Jamaica over a period of 15 years.\n\nHis bronze medal from the Sochi 2014 Olympics was only awarded five years later because of retrospective doping bans.\n\nThe sport was initially suggested to him by his coach, partly to help support his family.\n\n\"I was pretty broke and some trials came up,\" Fearon explained.\n\n\"It was a tough transition, there is a lot of lifting, you are a mechanic and there are a lot of long hours and time spent out in freezing cold conditions.\n\n\"If I didn't hold out [on] those rough days, I would have never known what was coming in the future.\"\n\nWelsh bobsleigher Moore makes Olympics for Jamaica\n\nHow British skeleton came back fighting after 2022\n\nWinter Olympics athletes to have broken medals fixed\n\nFearon initially came fifth in the four-man bobsleigh in Sochi, and with hindsight, he would not change the way it happened.\n\n\"We knew we were good enough. Knowing that we didn't [medal] actually just kept me striving,\" he said.\n\n\"I went straight to a relay camp. I didn't soak it in, didn't even enjoy it.\n\n\"If I would have got that medal, I probably wouldn't have run sub-10. I wouldn't have had the same drive.\"\n\nAt the time Fearon received it, he was on a season-long loan to Switzerland's bobsleigh team, with whom he won another bronze at the Europe Cup.\n\n\"They bought me, actually. They needed experienced athletes for one of their junior drivers, Timo Rohner,\" he remembered.\n\n\"We were the Swiss number one team that year. [Rohner] is at the Olympics with me [at Milan-Cortina], that's nice because this is his first Olympics and I had a little part in his journey.\"\n\nLike many athletes, Fearon's career has been affected by agonising injuries at key moments.\n\nHe has wires in his lower leg bones holding them together, following a serious one picked up while running for the British relay team.\n\n\"After that, I semi-retired from athletics, I still went and did a few things, but it wasn't the same,\" he said.\n\n\"It took a good two-year chunk out of my athletic career.\"\n\nBut while that pain eased over time as he recovered, what hit his family next was hard to put into words.\n\nIn 2023, his sister Natasha Morais was murdered.\n\nFeeling scared and suffering with insomnia, Fearon retired from all sport.\n\n\"It was tough for all of us. We are all still dealing with it in our own ways,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't think I was ever going to be able to do sport again. I really struggled with anxiety.\n\n\"I was becoming afraid to leave my family alone.\"\n\nComing out of retirement to represent Jamaica has given Fearon fresh focus and brought joy to a grieving family.\n\nBut he did not necessarily expect to be pushing a sled at another Winter Olympics.\n\n\"It was an athlete and coach role, I can do all the jobs across bobsleigh, even just organisational jobs,\" said Fearon, who met rapper Snoop Dogg while training in Italy.\n\n\"But we ended up getting in the sled. I've done six races and won six races, so I'm a pretty good lucky charm.\n\n\"I think they're going to have me pushing a few more times before I'm done,\" he joked.\n\nFearon's father is Jamaican, while his maternal grandparents are also from the Caribbean island.\n\n\"My dad was so proud. I've never seen him excited about sport before,\" he added.\n\n\"I didn't even know these guys a year ago and they're all like my brothers, I get more excited about them racing than I do myself racing.\n\n\"I'm probably taking on a dad role. Seeing how much they're excelling, it's just really exciting for me to watch and wonder where it could go.\"\n\nThe crossover between Fearon's two sports is a well-travelled path.\n\nFellow sprinter and bobsleigher Mica Moore is also part of Jamaica's squad in Milan-Cortina, having previously switched allegiance from Great Britain.\n\nFour years ago, Montell Douglas became GB's first female summer and Winter Olympian, while this year, track and field internationals Adele Nicoll and Ashleigh Nelson are in their squad.\n\nThey all have explosive power and speed over the initial acceleration phase where pushing the sled effectively is so vital.\n\nBut perhaps the crossover that Fearon is most excited about is the association with the 1993 hit film Cool Runnings about the Jamaican bobsleigh team.\n\n\"I love it, because I watched it when I was 10,\" he recalled.\n\n\"I had no idea I was ever going to have anything to do with bobsleigh at that point, never mind Jamaican bobsleigh.\n\n\"I've gone from being an Olympic medallist and part of this team, which is great, but now I'm a Disney character. Now I'm in a movie, it's different.\n\n\"We are the most famous team in the world, so it's for us to go out and do our flag proud.\"",

    "fullText": "Captain Michele Lamaro eloquently summed up how the perception around Italy has changed after they fell short in their bid for back-to-back Six Nations wins in Saturday's absorbing contest against Ireland.\n\nAfter beating Scotland in Rome, Italy arrived in Dublin with confidence and were the better team for large periods against the Irish, who withstood intense pressure from the Azzurri in the closing stages to win 20-13.\n\nAnd after Italy boss Gonzalo Quesada spoke of his pride in his team's performance, Lamaro was asked about their growing belief.\n\n\"This is my fifth year as a captain in the Six Nations and I remember my first year, the main question was, 'what do you think about Italy leaving the Six Nations?',\" said the Benetton back row.\n\n\"I've never believed that in a couple of years you can change things up too much. I always have a humble mindset because I know how much it takes to get to that level to be able to come here and perform and compete against an unbelievable team like Ireland.\n\n\"The perception means a lot. The belief we've created, I didn't have that growing up.\n\n\"I grew up with us being last in the table and that's the thing I'm most proud of, me coming through with a bunch of guys who might be able to win the championship one day.\"\n\nIreland survive Italy scare to claim first win\n\nIreland 'able to back ourselves' in win - Farrell\n\nLamaro, who was named Italy captain by Quesada's predecessor Kieran Crowley in 2021, added that the squad wants to \"inspire people\".\n\n\"Inspiring people around us, inspiring the kids coming through, giving them the chances we didn't have,\" added the 27-year-old.\n\n\"That's what we want to create. Sometimes it's tough because you find yourself in a tough situation but trusting the process is what you can do to have long-term ambition and legacy you can create.\n\n\"That makes us really proud and thank you for that [saying that Italy have improved] because it makes us proud to see how much the perception of the team has changed.\"\n\nWhen Quesada and Lamaro last led Italy into a match in Dublin, they lost 36-0.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, the Azzurri faced an Irish side lacking confidence after a bruising defeat by France in Paris last week.\n\n\"Obviously we wanted to take advantage of that. We knew if we put them under scoreboard pressure, it would have been very difficult for them.\n\n\"I've been in that situation before around mindsets. You have to perform and beat the team in front of you but if you're down after 20, 30 minutes, it can become a real pain in...I don't say where.\n\n\"They have some unbelievable players and they showed how much they care for this group and country. You always expect Ireland to be a world-class team.\n\n\"Ups and downs happen to every team in the world. At the moment, they haven't been what they want to be but I'm pretty sure they have all the abilities to get back.\"\n\nLamaro also ended Italy's post-match news conference with an unprompted tribute to Hollie Davidson after the Scottish official became the first woman to referee a men's Six Nations game.\n\n\"I just want to congratulate her,\" he said.\n\n\"She has been doing so much for world rugby and our game and I think it's an important thing to say.\n\n\"I appreciated the work we did together today on the pitch.\n\n\"Whatever the decision was, I was backing her and making sure everything was going the right way so I just want to congratulate her and thank her for the effort on the field.\"",

    "title": "The Once-Popular Sandwich Chain Pushing For A Comeback",
    "description": "This sandwich chain has dwindled from thousands of locations to several hundred. Armed with a new CEO and game plan, the brand hopes to relive its glory days.",
    "fullText": "If you have fond memories of hot chicken carbonara and black angus steakhouse subs (not to mention those bizarre Quiznos spongmonkeys), but have a hard time finding them now, it's because the chain has dwindled to a fraction of what it once was. Quiznos had around 5,000 outlets globally in the early 2000s, of which about 4,700 were in the U.S.. Then, in the decade between 2007 and 2017, it lost a whopping 90% of its outlets. Despite filing for bankruptcy in 2014, Quiznos continued to plummet. The precipitous fall was a result of multiple factors, including a business model that essentially earned money by squeezing franchisee profits. While still a shadow of its Subway-competing days, Quiznos is making moves that could be the start of a comeback.\n\nQuiznos' rapid decline in the early 21st century is proof of just how quickly fortunes can change in the QSR industry. Even Subway, the sandwich chain Quiznos played second fiddle to for years, is at its lowest restaurant count in the United States in the last 20 years after closing over 600 locations in 2024. In contrast, the Quiznos outlet that opened in Tucson, Arizona, that same year broke the company's opening day sales record. At its current relatively small scale, the hot sub brand is nimble and trying a ton of new things, some of which are starting to stick. New partnerships, a novel modular restaurant format that could significantly speed up expansion, and the self-awareness to not repeat past mistakes are all part of the new Quiznos.\n\nWhen Quiznos opened in 1981 and started dishing out hot subs, it attracted significant attention and business. Now, the company is going to have to do a lot more to differentiate itself. The revival mantra is a comprehensive overhaul from the ground up. Acquired by the Rego Restaurant Group in 2018 and under a new CEO since March 2025, the Quiznos turnaround started with its outlets and updated kitchen equipment. The toaster has made way for deep fryers and grills, resulting in more varied flavors and faster prep for a high-potential drive-thru sales category. New items like the Asian Steak Dipper, the Steakhouse Philly, and even a vegetarian protein-based Beyond Italian Sausage sandwich are all joining Quiznos fan favorites on the updated menu.\n\nThe company's partnership with the Nebraska-based convenience store and gas chain Pump and Pantry in 2022 has also added fuel to the fire (pun intended). After four successful outlets, the company plans on adding six more to its roster. Expansion remains crucial to success, which has led to Quiznos' innovative Qube concept. These prefabricated outlets require less time and space to set up and come fully equipped, making the opening of new outlets a more streamlined affair. Most importantly, this entices franchisees.",

    "description": "Thirteen months after being embarrassed 8-0 by Manchester City, Salford City produce a performance to make their fans proud.",
    "fullText": "Salford City arrived at Etihad Stadium with a certain amount of trepidation, the scars of last season's 8-0 FA Cup defeat still fresh in the mind.\n\nThis time the League Two club left Manchester City's home with their heads held high after going toe-to-toe with the club still hoping to pull off an unprecedented quadruple this season.\n\n\"It was demoralising last season, our confidence dipped,\" Salford captain Luke Garbutt told BBC Sport after pushing their opponents all the way before losing 2-0.\n\n\"Today is a totally different feel.\n\n\"On another day we would've got a goal. To come away with 2-0 when it was 8-0 last season shows the club is on the rise.\"\n\nSalford, the club co-owned by Manchester United stars Gary Neville and David Beckham, were playing in the fourth round for the first time in their history.\n\nAnd they were in the tie right up to the moment substitute Marc Guehi doubled the lead with his first Manchester City goal since a £20m move from Crystal Palace in the 81st minute.\n\n\"They defended so well,\" said Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola. \"They had more chances near the end, they were really good.\"\n\nGuehi scores first Man City goal in win over Salford\n\n'Not what I expected' - Trafford on Man City back-up role\n\nSalford's players stayed on the pitch a good five minutes after the full-time whistle to show their appreciation to their travelling fans.\n\n\"Why did you bring that up?\" manager Karl Robinson joked in his post-match press conference, when a reporter mentioned last season's eight-goal drubbing.\n\nHe must have feared his side were facing another hammering when Alfie Dorrington scored an own goal in the sixth minute.\n\nThe visitors, however, regrouped.\n\nNot only did they prevent their opponents from registering an attempt on target before half-time, they twice went close to scoring themselves through Ben Woodburn and Brandon Cooper.\n\nIt was still only 1-0 when James Trafford denied Kelly N'Mai, before Guardiola sent on Antoine Semenyo, Nico O'Reilly, Rodri and Guehi, the latter eventually easing home nerves nine minutes from the end.\n\n\"It's about us using this as a benchmark to move forward,\" added Robinson, whose side sit sixth in the fourth tier of English football.\n\n\"We couldn't do that last season. We have to get out of League Two.\n\n\"It was a fantastic defensive performance against one of the best teams in Europe.\n\n\"They had to bring on four of their best players in the last 20 minutes. We dust ourselves off and get ready for Tuesday [Newport County at home].\"\n\nFormer Manchester City midfielder Michael Brown, who was at Etihad Stadium for BBC Sport, said Salford will learn from Saturday's experience.\n\n\"For Salford to get to this stage they have done well,\" he added.\n\n\"The test was there with this draw, but Robinson will have learned a lot about his players.\"\n\nGarbutt added: \"They are a world-class team and they are going to create chances and score good goals but we kept that to a minimum.\"\n\nGuardiola mentioned in his pre-match news conference how he \"enjoys\" playing FA Cup ties away from home against League One and League Two clubs.\n\n\"When you arrive at the stadium on the coach and all the fans sing 'Who are ya?! Who are ya?!\" added Guardiola.\n\nOn Saturday, Salford's 3,900 fans inside Etihad Stadium made themselves heard as the visitors took the game to their Premier League opponents.\n\nAfterwards, Guardiola labelled his side's 41st game of the season \"boring\".\n\n\"It has been tough but not just this two weeks, since November it's been every three days and that's a lot,\" he added.\n\n\"The good news is we go through.\n\n\"We have to move the ball quick to the opposite side and we didn't do it. That's why it was boring.\"\n\nCity might not have been at their best but it's now 17 FA Cup wins in a row at Etihad Stadium since a 2-0 defeat by Middlesbrough back in 2015.",

    "fullText": "Harry Kane has made history by becoming the first Englishman to reach 500 professional goals in official games.\n\nThe Bayern Munich striker hit the milestone with a brace against Werder Bremen on Saturday.\n\nKane was already the highest-scoring Englishman, having surpassed Jimmy Greaves' total of 474 in December.\n\nIt has been another remarkable goal-scoring season for Kane, who has 26 goals in just 22 Bundesliga games. And it is only February.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at how Kane has scored his goals and what other records he could break.\n\nKane's first goal in professional football came 15 years ago when he scored as a 17-year-old playing for Leyton Orient against Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nThat was one of five goals he got for the O's before he went on to score two goals for Leicester, nine for Millwall, 280 for Tottenham and is currently on 126 goals for Bayern Munich.\n\nKane is also the highest-scoring man for England with 78 goals for the Three Lions.\n\nAlmost half of his goals have come in the Premier League (213). After that he has scored 89 in the Bundesliga while he has also been prolific in the Champions League.\n\nHe was already by far and away the highest-scoring Englishman in European football elite club competition as he currently sits on 48 goals, 18 more than Wayne Rooney, who sits second on that list.\n\nKane has also scored in every competition he has played in.\n\nGreaves' record as the highest-scoring Englishman stood for six decades until Kane overtook his tally two months ago.\n\nKane left the Premier League as the second-highest scorer in the competition, with Alan Shearer holding the record with 260 goals.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), Shearer sits fourth in the all-time list of English scorers with 409 goals, with Steve Bloomer - who played in the early part of the 20th century - third with 412 goals, behind Greaves and Kane.\n\nDixie Dean sits fifth with 396 top-level goals and Rooney is sixth on 360.\n\nKane is a master at taking penalties and a fifth of his 500 goals have come from the spot.\n\nIn open play he is deadly inside the box with 349 of his goals coming from there.\n\nThe vast majority of his goals have come from his right foot (318) with 94 of them being headers.\n\nThe goal that saw him reach 500 was of the type that is quite rare for Kane. He struck from distance, making it one of 49 he has scored from outside the box.\n\nKane reached 500 goals in 743 appearances for club and country.\n\nThat means he got to the milestone quicker than Portugal legend Cristiano Ronaldo, who in 2015 hit his 500th goal on his 753rd game in professional football.\n\nHowever, Lionel Messi was the quickest of the three to reach the landmark.\n\nThe Argentina star scored his 500th goal in April 2016 on what was his 632nd professional appearance. That's 121 matches faster than Ronaldo and 111 games quicker than Kane.\n\nKane is already England's record scorer but there's a few other things at club level he can aim for.\n\nRobert Lewandowski holds the record for the most goals scored in a single Bundesliga season, having hit 41 in 2020-21.\n\nKane is certainly in a good position to surpass that tally as he currently has 26 goals with 12 games remaining.\n\nIn Europe, he could break his own record - having become the highest-scoring Englishman in a single Champions League campaign when he scored 11 last term. He is currently on eight goals.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Newcastle United beat Aston Villa in the FA Cup fourth round in a match dominated by a number of controversial decisions without VAR.",
    "fullText": "Has there ever been a better advert for the video assistant referee?\n\nNewcastle's 3-1 FA Cup fourth-round win at Aston Villa was full of controversy with the video assistant referee (VAR) once again the big talking point - even though it wasn't even in use.\n\nFor this season and the previous FA Cup campaign, it has not been used until the fifth round, with many fans looking forward to a return to football without interruptions from technology.\n\nBut referee Chris Kavanagh will have been wishing he had VAR to fall back on at Villa Park after an offside opener for the hosts, a blatant penalty for the visitors not awarded, plus at least three other controversial decisions that could have affected the outcome.\n\nUltimately, Newcastle - who were on the wrong end of the majority of the calls - progressed into the last 16, but manager Eddie Howe couldn't hide his disappointment with the officials.\n\nTammy Abraham's opener for Villa was offside, Lucas Digne's second-half handball should have been given as a penalty rather than a free-kick outside the box, while the French full-back was also fortunate to escape a red card for a reckless challenge on Jacob Murphy.\n\nHowe said: \"I'm so torn because the game is better without VAR in terms of excitement and the spectacle for the supporters and us when we're living a moment live.\n\n\"But it does give accurate results. It does make the game more precise in terms of decision-making. You have to respect those moments. They're worth their weight in gold.\n\n\"When VAR is there, there is a tendency to think, 'oh well I won't give that because VAR is there to check it'. Then your decision-making isn't as sharp as it would normally have to be. Maybe there is a difference there.\n\n\"I'm always torn on VAR because I love the raw emotion when a goal goes in and you don't see a flag or hear a whistle and you know the goal is going to stand and nobody can take it away from you. But, on the other side of that, I was wishing there was VAR for the goal they scored against us - and probably throughout the entire game.\"\n\nVilla, themselves, will be reflecting on a straight red card for goalkeeper Marco Bizot in first-half added time when they were leading 1-0, and could argue Dan Burn was offside for the visitors' equaliser through Sandro Tonali.\n\nBoss Unai Emery, added: \"Today it makes sense understanding that VAR is necessary. It's necessary to help the referees.\"\n\nAfter a season so far, which has seen VAR the talking point on a weekly basis, has a weekend without it shown the potential problems?\n\nEx-England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"For five or six months, they have been relying on VAR and they come into this situation and it all changes.\n\n\"In their defence, which is hard for me, they have VAR for five to six months, then come into a huge game without it, so it is difficult for them.\n\n\"I would like the officials to do their job properly. It is not too much to ask, is it.\n\n\"If you ever needed any evidence of the damage that VAR has done to referees, I think today is a great example of that. These guys look petrified to make a decision today because they didn't have a comfort blanket.\"\n\nWhy is there no VAR in the FA Cup third and fourth round?\n\nTonali double helps Newcastle fight back for win at Villa\n\nAfter watching the replays, Abraham's goal should clearly have been ruled out for offside, but it was the Digne non-penalty decision that really left most speechless.\n\nThe Villa full-back was at least a yard inside the penalty area when he was penalised for a handball, but incredibly Kavanagh awarded a free-kick - from which Tonali eventually scored the 63rd-minute equaliser.\n\nFormer England striker Wayne Rooney told Match of the Day Live: \"That decision is one of the worst decisions I have ever seen in football because at no stage was Digne out of the penalty box.\n\n\"He is three or four yards inside. The linesman is just in front of it and you can clearly see how much he is in the penalty box.\n\n\"The referee looked like he blew and looked like he was listening to someone in his ear, so I'm assuming the linesman gave the decision, and it's absolute shocker.\"\n\nAnd former Newcastle forward Shearer added: \"There is perhaps a small excuse for the referee to not see this, but I am being kind to him.\n\n\"But there is no excuse whatsoever for the assistant, who is 10-15 yards away, Nick Greenhalgh, who had a nightmare today.\n\n\"I don't think that is a difficult decision at all. In fact, it is easy. At this standard, that has to be given. There is no excuse for the assistant to not tell the referee that he has got that totally wrong.\"\n\nA marginal VAR offside decision caused a fair amount of controversy for Newcastle in midweek. Joe Willock had a goal disallowed at Tottenham when the semi-automated technology said his forehead was offside.\n\nAbraham's goal was the kind of decision the video review was brought in for - the real howlers.\n\nThe Villa striker was clearly ahead of the defence when Douglas Luiz played the free-kick. With VAR, the goal would have been ruled out.\n\nIt would be easy to blame switching between systems as a defence for the assistant, Nick Greenhalgh. But with or without VAR, he would be expected to raise his flag if he's identified an offside.\n\nShould Digne have been sent off?\n\nWould the VAR have stepped in to show a red card to Digne for serious foul play with his late challenge on Jacob Murphy? It is far from certain from what we have seen in the Premier League.\n\nWe often hear the VAR has referenced glancing contact to uphold the decison of a yellow card. See Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby last month.\n\nDigne did come in at some speed and that would have increased the chance of being sent off on review.\n\nYet the Frenchman did not push through on to the shin of the Newcastle player. That his foot came off quickly probably would have saved him.\n\nIt may well have been one of those where the on-field decision would have stood, whether it was yellow or red card.\n\nSerious foul play or denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity (Dogso)?\n\nReally, this incident could have been either. After all, Bizot brought down Murphy with a knee-high challenge - although it was not with studs leading.\n\nWhen the Dutch goalkeeper fouled the Newcastle forward, the Magpies were left with three attackers up against only Luiz, although Dogso could only be applied to the player fouled.\n\nThe VAR would have taken into account the general run of the ball was not towards goal. They would also consider if Luiz would have been able to get across to prevent the shot.\n\nYou can make a case for a degree of doubt for Dogso. But much like the Digne decision it is one which would likely have stayed with the on-field decision.\n\nDid Digne handle in the penalty area?\n\nIt is hard to understand just how referee Chris Kavanagh and his assistant managed to give a free-kick.\n\nAt no point was Digne outside the penalty area.\n\nNot before Kieran Trippier played the cross or at the moment the Villa player raised his arms and committed the handball. Even after the offence he continued walking in the box.\n\nThe VAR would have needed seconds to correct the free-kick to a penalty.\n\nWas Burn offside for equaliser?\n\nFrom the resulting free-kick Newcastle did score anyway through Tonali, but with VAR in use, it could have been disallowed.\n\nWhen Trippier floated in the free-kick, defender Burn ran across the front of the Villa defence. It looked like the England international may well have been marginally offside.\n\nWhile Burn did not touch the ball, he both pushed down on Abraham and jumped in front of substitute goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.\n\nIt would have been close but if the semi-automated technology found the Newcastle player was offside, the goal would have been ruled out.",

    "description": "England got back to winning ways against Scotland but their T20 World Cup hopes look slim unless there are significant improvements, writes Matthew Henry.",
    "fullText": "Harry Brook's laugh as he began his post-match press conference said plenty.\n\n\"We haven't quite made it as easy as we would have liked so far,\" the relieved England captain said.\n\nAfter three games at this T20 World Cup, England have escaped against Nepal, been thrashed by West Indies and now come through a nervy win against Scotland.\n\nBeat Italy on Monday and they will be through to the Super 8s.\n\nFrom there, two wins from three, one of which could be against Zimbabwe, would be enough to reach a World Cup semi-final. Reach that point and anything can happen, or so they say.\n\nEngland edge to victory to leave Scotland on brink\n\nTucker's 94 keeps Ireland's World Cup hopes alive\n\nEngland have, of course, also been here before.\n\nThey have won three World Cups, two in the 20-over format and the 50-over competition in 2019, and on each occasion they lost at least once before going on to lift the trophy.\n\nAcross the nine previous men's T20 World Cups, only once, India last time around in 2024, has a team gone through the tournament unbeaten.\n\nA defeat at this stage, or an unconvincing performance like the one put in on Saturday in Kolkata, does not decide the eventual outcome.\n\nIndia were 77-6 against the United States, Australia were beaten by Zimbabwe and the much-fancied South Africa almost chucked away a winning position against Afghanistan in a tournament that has been more competitive from the start than any of its previous iterations.\n\nBut that does not mean poor performances can simply be ignored.\n\nYes, reach your peak at the right time.\n\nYou still have to show you are capable of reaching the top when tackling the foothills.\n\nOpener Phil Salt said on Friday \"nobody can live with\" England when \"we are at our best\" but they remain a long way from it.\n\nThis five-wicket victory margin, sealed with 10 balls to spare, suggested a more comfortable afternoon than England had in reality.\n\nAgain there was jeopardy - Jos Buttler failing to reach 40 for the eighth time for England this year, Salt offering too much famine amid the feast, an uncertainty among batters when the ball moves and, most worryingly, another refusal to learn while the game is in its flow.\n\nEight of Scotland's 10 wickets fell as batters attempted to sweep, pull or heave the ball into the leg side. Having watched that, Jacob Bethell, Brook and Sam Curran took it upon themselves to ensure more catching practice was offered.\n\nIt is no surprise Tom Banton, who missed with a sweep early on and then put the shot away entirely, went on to be England's highest scorer and match-winner.\n\nBanton's knock was a breakthrough moment for a batter who, having been handed a debut aged 20 in 2019, had only made four fifties across his 36 previous innings.\n\nHere he looked far more mature than he did back on that tour of New Zealand, or the home summer that followed and his success pushes away any doubts over the make-up of the top order.\n\nBen Duckett's route into the XI appears to have been blocked.\n\nThere have been other positives for England over the past week in India.\n\nJofra Archer was more threatening, more accurate, against Scotland after conceding 90 runs combined against Nepal and West Indies.\n\nHaving rehired fielding coach Carl Hopkinson after the whoopsies spread through the squad during the Ashes, England's catching has also been immaculate and Curran, this dismissal aside, has proven dependable in crucial moments.\n\nBut still England are clinging to the hope that something will eventually click, that something will simply fall into place and provide them with their first complete performance of the competition.\n\nIt may come - possibly, should they beat Italy, on a flight back to the comfort of Sri Lanka where they won 3-0 before this trip - but right now England do not seem entirely clear where to look.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Brook, asked why his side have not found their groove. \"Things haven't seemed to have clicked so far yet.\"\n\nBrook was part of England's squads at the 2022 and 2024 World Cups, which both began badly before turning in differing directions.\n\nIn 2022, England lost to Ireland but responded by comprehensively beating a New Zealand side that just thrashed hosts Australia by 89 runs.\n\nEngland need a similar performance soon to reboot their tournament because right now it feels more akin to their efforts in 2024, when their only wins came against Oman, Namibia, the United States and West Indies.\n\nEngland reached the semi-finals on that trip around the Caribbean but were beaten each time they faced the real contenders - Australia, South Africa and India.\n\nIn truth, the spark from England's white-ball sides has been absent going back much further, ever since that night in Melbourne in November 2022.\n\nIt was absent at the 2023 World Cup, in the Caribbean in 2024 and at the Champions Trophy in Pakistan last year when the hiring of Brendon McCullum as white-ball coach failed to raise them from their slump and they left without winning a match.\n\nBrook says it is the \"belief\" in the squad that makes him confident this tournament would be more like 2022 than 2024.\n\n\"We've been in this situation before where we have lost a game early and World Cups aren't always smooth sailing,\" he said.\n\nOutside of the dressing room, that belief is waning.\n\nIf Brook cannot find it then coach McCullum must because an underwhelming run to the semi-finals did not save former coach Matthew Mott his job in 2024.\n\nSalt thinks England can beat anyone on their day and it is time for them to pinpoint a date in the calendar.\n\nMost of sport's successful teams have had an arrogant streak. Crucially, though, it needs to be earned.\n\nThe Scotland win ensured they remain alive but England have no chance of winning this World Cup if they do not improve.",

    "fullText": "Standing pitchside in the aftermath of Scotland's bazooka proving too much for England's pop gun, Sione Tuipulotu, a captain stepping back from the abyss, spoke of the trauma that his players went through after the debacle in Rome a week ago. A week which now feels like a year.\n\nNow, in a happier place, he could never remember hurting after a game like he hurt after Italy last weekend. He \"internalised the pain\" of that defeat. Then he let it loose on England.\n\nTuipulotu made his point like a man who had been through therapy. In the mind's eye you could imagine him stretched out on a couch with the sound of gently lapping water playing in his ears. Better that than listening to the torrents of stick about his team and the wounding chat about his head coach.\n\nGregor Townsend watched what he said, later on.\n\nMaybe part of him wanted to vent at all the doubters, which was just about everybody outside his bubble. He didn't go there.\n\nMaybe there was an urge to gloat after the 31-20 triumph, but he resisted.\n\nTownsend was stony-faced. No smile, no jocularity, no sense that he had just won a major victory. If you didn't know better you'd swear he was the losing coach, not the renaissance man.\n\nHe didn't articulate it, but this has been a savagely bruising week for him. He now has redemption, for a week. He has all the evidence he needs that his team, on their best days, when their sense of outrage and vengeance is high, can be truly outstanding.\n\nGetting themselves to fever pitch when there's cordite in the air is one thing. Getting there when all you can smell are roses is quite another.\n\nHaving used that terrible experience of Rome as fuel for Murrayfield, what will get them to the dark place - as the prop Pierre Schoeman might put it - before Wales in Cardiff on Saturday?\n\nThat's the next Test, the next must-win.\n\nScotland delivered for Townsend - Tuipulotu\n\nError-strewn England flunk oldest Test at Murrayfield\n\nRejuvenated Scotland sweep England aside in stunning Calcutta Cup win\n\nScotland travel to Cardiff as hot favourites, but without three players from the Calcutta Cup. Victory has come at a cost.\n\nJack Dempsey, belligerence on legs, Jamie Ritchie, a warrior in his 40 minutes, and Jamie Dobie, class in every area after a rough experience in Rome, are not going to make it to Wales.\n\nDempsey and Ritchie might not be seen again in the championship.\n\nTownsend could have done without those blows, but he's used to the carnage of Six Nations rugby. He also has decent deputies in store for the trip to the Principality Stadium.\n\nOne win must become two or else the significance of what happened at Murrayfield goes away like so many of the other victories over England. Unless it's properly built upon then it's a one-off and everybody connected with this team is fed up with one-offs.\n\nAll the self-doubt Scotland owned now transfers to England. It's a heavy burden. It's said, endlessly, that Scotland get up for England more than they get up for any other opposition. We can debate the accuracy of that until the cows come home.\n\nThe relevant question about this England team, and the ones that have come before them in a run of five defeats in six against the Scots is why don't they get up for Scotland?\n\nThe dawning of reality should be close at hand now for England players - 'maybe it's not you, Scotland, maybe it's us'.\n\nTuipulotu said on Friday his team were desperate and he wanted to see that desperation visited upon England. He got his wish.\n\nWe know Scotland had this kind of performance deep within them - there's been plenty, if fleeting, evidence of their class - but what we didn't know, what we could not take on trust, was their ability to deliver this kind of controlled fury for 80 minutes.\n\nBut they did. This was as dominant a Scotland performance as you'll get over England, a thing of thunder and beauty, class and heart, ruthlessness and intelligence. All those combined Calcutta Cup teams that people did pre-match - Scotland had an average of three or four players in a joint side - were ripped to shreds. A new version would have more tartan than a shortbread factory.\n\nIt was a game that threw up dozens of cameos to ponder, not just the creation and execution of the Scotland tries but the bare-knuckle stuff they delivered in defence. To a man, starting team and bench, they stood up.\n\nStood up for themselves, for their coach, for their supporters.\n\nWith each demonic play in defence during that second half you got a snapshot of how difficult this past week has been for them and how they were prepared to do anything - anything - to make it better.\n\nScotland Rugby Podcast: Impressive Scotland regain Calcutta Cup\n\nThere was a surreal moment on a storied day, not Matt Fagerson's charge-down of George Ford's late ill-fated drop goal nor the offload to Jones, nor the way Jones ate up road on the way to scoring his second of the day and his eight in eight Calcutta Cups.\n\nIt wasn't the fact Scotland had now secured a bonus point in a game they were supposed to lose or that they were 18 points clear of a heavily fancied England, as trippy as that was.\n\nNo. What was unusual was the lack of weakness out there in the middle and up there in the stands, the total absence of Scottish wobbles and Scottish fatalism, which can be a local speciality at times.\n\nWatching this team lose, or threaten to lose, big leads in games in recent seasons breeds a certain worry. The mental implosions, the victories left behind them.\n\nThere was none of that this time. Even as England came piling forward, the old familiar fretfulness didn't exist. You knew, as much as you could possibly know, that Scotland were winning this. That feeling of near certainty - it was an odd feeling.\n\nEngland had their moments when chasing, but Scotland met each and every one head on. It was raw and it was special. Ambitious rugby is in the DNA of this team. How could it not be when Finn Russell, utterly brilliant, is its creative heartbeat?\n\nAgainst England, it was married with fire. Scotland haven't always got the balance right - too much rugby and not enough dog - but it was inch-perfect on Saturday. Riotously so.\n\nThe psychology of this team is something that would make Sigmund Freud swoon. Gloriously unpredictable and, at times, impossible to read, they are wildly entertaining - bewildering, bewitching, brilliant.

    "description": "MacKenzie Scott has donated $26 billion in the past several years.",
    "fullText": "MacKenzie Scott has been one of the most generous philanthropists during the past few years, and an episode in college may help explain why.\n\nAfter finalizing her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2019, Scott ended up with a load of shares she earned from helping to build the e-commerce giant during its early days, when she helped with business plans and contracts. Upon their divorce, Scott received roughly a 4% stake in Amazon, or about 139 million shares at the time.\n\nSince 2020, Scott has reduced her stake by 42%, selling or donating about 58 million shares. The philanthropist is still worth nearly $28 billion today, despite having donated $26 billion through her philanthropic platform Yield Giving, which she founded in 2022. Yield Giving has donated to thousands of organizations, focused on issues including DEI, education, disaster recovery, and more.\n\nThis fall alone, she donated well over $400 million to several education- and DEI-focused organizations, many of which received the largest gifts in their respective histories.\n\nScott sees the value of and need for support, especially during someone’s early, formative years. After all, she had to borrow money from her college roommate when she was struggling.\n\n“It is these ripple effects that make imagining the power of any of our own acts of kindness impossible,” Scott wrote of giving in an Oct. 15 essay published to her Yield Giving site. “Whose generosity did I think of every time I made every one of the thousands of gifts I’ve been able to give?\n\n“It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college. It was the college roommate who found me crying, and acted on her urge to loan me a thousand dollars to keep me from having to drop out in my sophomore year.”\n\nAfter graduating from Princeton University, Scott went on to become a talented novelist—a product of none other than Toni Morrison’s teaching. And in 2005, Scott published her debut novel, The Testing of Luther Albright, which won an American Book Award in 2006. Morrison reviewed the book as “a rarity: a sophisticated novel that breaks and swells the heart.”\n\nHer roommate from Princeton saw the difference that the $1,000 gift had made in her life, and that inspired her roommate to start a company 20 years later that offers loans to low-income students without a cosigner.\n\nThat roommate was Jeannie Ringo Tarkenton, who went on to found Funding U, which has provided $80 million in low-interest loans to about 8,000 students who needed help to pay for college, according to Princeton. Tarkenton still plays it cool, though, when asked about how she changed Scott’s life.",

    "description": "\"I don't,\" the South Carolina senator said at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference",
    "fullText": "Lindsey Graham offered a blunt and dismissive message to Europeans worried about Donald Trump's vocal plans to take over Greenland\n\n“Who gives a s--- who owns Greenland? I don’t,” the South Carolina senator said at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference\n\nGraham's message comes amid Trump's quest for full “ownership” of Greenland, which has strained U.S. relations with NATO allies\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham dismissed worries about President Donald Trump's quest for full “ownership” of Greenland, including threats to acquire it by force.\n\nGraham's blunt message came at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference on Friday, Feb. 13, after journalist Jonathan Martin asked the South Carolina Republican, 70, if he has a message for Europeans in the audience “who are obviously nervous” about Trump’s controversial plans for the NATO territory.\n\nGraham, a Trump ally, first joked about Martin’s question. “Well, if you're nervous, have a beer,” he said. “Go see a doctor. Stop being nervous.”\n\nGraham then downplayed the president’s bid to take over the territory, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark — and which has stressed the United States’ relations with Denmark and other NATO allies.\n\nSharing his actual message to “my European friends,” Graham said, “Greenland is behind us, but the goal is to get outcomes.”\n\n“Who gives a s--- who owns Greenland? I don’t,” the senator continued. “So the point is Greenland is going to be more fortified because Donald Trump, once he feels like it’s his brand or his buy-in, is going to go big.”\n\nWhen he was questioned about Denmark’s relationship with the U.S. amid Trump’s vocal plans to seize control of Greenland, Graham said, “I think we’re good.”\n\n“I think everybody is hugging it out and, you know, we’ll live to fight another day,” he added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nTrump previously linked his loss of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to his desire to seize control of Greenland in a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.\n\nIn his January letter to Støre, Trump urged the politician to give the U.S. “Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” despite the fact that Støre was not responsible for Trump's Nobel loss, nor does he control the fate of Greenland.\n\n\"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,\" Trump wrote in the letter.\n\nHe later doubled down on his Greenland plans in a Truth Social post the same day, writing, \"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!! President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nIn a January interview with The New York Times, Trump said his desire to have ownership of Greenland is \"psychologically important” to him.\n\nStill, reporters questioned why he wouldn't just send more American troops to Greenland if his goal was, as he previously stated, to fend off foreign threats from China and Russia.\n\nAfter Trump told the outlet that ownership of the NATO territory is “what I feel is psychologically needed for success,” the Times' White House correspondent Katie Rogers — whom Trump recently called \"ugly, both inside and out\" for writing a story about his age — asked him to clarify, \"Psychologically important to you or to the United States?\"\n\n“Psychologically important for me,\" Trump replied to Rogers. \"Now, maybe another president would feel differently, but so far I’ve been right about everything.\"",

    "fullText": "This is a developing story. ABC4 will update this post as more information becomes available.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — A 3.5 magnitude earthquake hit northwest of West Valley City and many people across the Wasatch Front felt it.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, a 3.6 km earthquake struck north-west of West Valley City. The earthquake’s epicenter was around 8.3km deep and occurred around 6:32 p.m.\n\nABC4 acquired video footage of the earthquake from some who felt it and from our own station. Below is our tower camera, which shook quite a bit during the quake.\n\nA Utah resident captured the earthquake on his camera, taken near 1800 S Redwood Road\n\nDid you get footage of the earthquake? You can email us at news@abc4.com for a chance to be featured.\n\nWhile it is difficult to prepare for earthquakes ahead of time, it is important to stay aware of what to do if one occurs.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention states that you should immediately drop down onto your hands and knees, cover your head and neck underneath a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on to your shelter.\n\nIf you cannot drop to the ground or get underneath a shelter, the CDC recommends that you sit down or remain seated. You should find something to protect your head and neck, such as a large book, a pillow, or your arms.\n\nIf you’re outside when the earthquake starts, it’s best to go to an open area away from trees, telephone poles and buildings. However, if you’re inside during an earthquake, you should stay inside.\n\nOnce the initial earthquake is over, there still may be aftershocks. The CDC says you should avoid taking elevators, because the power could go out. Gas lines or water lines could also burst, leading to potential hazards.\n\nIf you are a shoreline following an earthquake, you should immediately head to higher ground and move inland, as the earthquake may have generated a tsunami.\n\nIt’s possible that there will be fallen debris and other hazards in the area, so the CDC says you may need to travel on foot. If you’re in a moving vehicle, they recommend stopping as quickly and safely as possible and set the parking brake. If a downed power line falls on the car, you should stay inside until a trained individual removes the wire.\n\nYou can learn more about earthquake safety here.\n\nThis is a developing story. ABC4 will update this post as more information becomes available.\n\n‘One moment can change everything’: Family mourns the loss of man who died in Eagle Mountain crash on Wednesday\n\n2 arrested after K-9 sniffs out $300,000 worth of drugs during Blanding traffic stop\n\nOlympic athlete couples celebrate Valentine’s Day in Milan\n\nMore conflict in curling as Canadian women are accused of the same violation as men\n\nNations League draw: Spain, England and Croatia in same group",
