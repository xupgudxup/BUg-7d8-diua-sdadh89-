They compete for medals and national pride, pushing the world's top competitors.\n\nItaly is honored to host the 2026 Winter Olympics from February 6 to February 22. This will be Italy's fourth time hosting the Olympics and its first since 2006.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the 2026 Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nMORE: Who are the biggest USA Olympic hockey snubs?\n\nThe 2026 Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo has previously hosted the Olympics, but only the Summer Games. This is the first time Milan is hosting the Olympics, and it is also Cortina d'Ampezzo's first time hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\nHere's a list of each time Italy has hosted the Olympics:\n\nMilan and Cortina d'Ampezzo host 15 Olympic venues. Below is a full list of the sports scheduled at each location.\n\nMilano San Siro Olympic Stadium\n\nMilano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nCortina Curling Olympic Stadium\n\nCurling, wheelchair curling, Paralympic closing ceremony\n\nAlpine skiing, para alpine skiing\n\nTesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium\n\nCross-country skiing, Nordic combined, para biathlon, para cross-country skiing\n\nAlpine skiing, ski mountaineering\n\nOlympic closing ceremony, Paralympic opening ceremony\n\nThe time difference can significantly affect viewers wanting to watch the Olympic Games.

The organizers of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics have announced an operating budget of approximately \"1.7 billion euros\" ($1.9 billion).\n\nThe International Olympic Committee will provide approximately $1 billion in extra funding for the February 6-22 Games. At the same time, the Italian government is investing over $1 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance access to the venues.\n\nAlthough this appears substantial, Russia reportedly invested $51 billion to host the 2014 Sochi Games, a cost that is expected to remain an Olympic record for many years to come.\n\nThe Milano Cortina Olympics will welcome thousands of athletes from across the world for the 2026 Winter Games. They'll stay in one of the six Olympic Villages spread across northern Italy.\n\nThe locations include Milan, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo, Anterselva (Antholz), and Cortina.\n\nIt is said that after the games, some villages will be converted into student housing.",

    "fullText": "LAKELAND — The 2025-26 Lakeland Christian boys soccer team wasn’t Grandy Streets’ most talented team, but it certainly was one of Streets’ favorite group to coach. It was an overachieving group of players who gave him their all.\n\nUnfortunately for the Vikings, it wasn’t enough on Tuesday night.\n\nTampa Berkeley Prep gained the momentum for about 15 minutes during the second half, and Matthew Carroll scored the only goal of the match in the 66th minute to defeat Lakeland Christian, 1-0, in the Class 1A, Region 3 quarterfinals.\n\nThe Vikings season came to and end, but the finished 9-7-2 and claimed another district title.\n\nBoys Soccer: McKeel takes district, now looks to fulfill its potential\n\nGirls Soccer: Sylvia Rodriguez, Hayden Fullwood lead Victory Christian soccer for playoff run\n\n“It's been a really fun year,” Streets said. “It's probably been one of the top teams I've ever coached as far as experiences. I’m very proud of all of them.”\n\nWhile there is a core of underclassmen whom Streets will build around, the Vikings will have to replace the defensive core, led by goalkeeper Ben Harrison. He made a couple of outstanding saves against Berkeley Prep that kept LCS in the match.\n\n“He’s a phenomenal goalkeeper,” Sreets said.\n\nThe other seniors who led LCS were Micah Roloff, Reyeker Bradford and Kristian Spann. And it’s not just their play on the field that has to be replace.\n\n“The leadership of Micah is phenomenal,” Streets said. “He's probably the best leader I've ever had. I've never had a leader like that. Same thing with Ben — just tremendous leadership.”\n\nGoing forward, LCS will build around Jackson Castano, Parker Wilson, Parker Harrell, Ryder Sullivan, Evan Grieger, Jackson Green and Dylan Coyle.\n\n“I like all the kids that are on this team,” Streets said. “There’s about eight who are going to return who are very good, and then there’s your JV team and our middle school. We have a lot of young eighth- and ninth-graders who are fantastic players. It’ll be a young team for the next couple of years, and in a few years, they’re going to be something special.”\n\nAlso in 1A, Region 3, Fort Meade’s season came to an end as Carrollwood Day defeated the Miners, 8-0.\n\nStryker Holmes scored three goals and added two assists to lead McKeel in the regional quarterfinals.\n\nWilliam Johnson and Daniel Rathore each had two goals and one assist. Jurem Alejo also had a goal. Ian Acevedo picked up two assists, and Milan Chivraman added one assist.\n\nMcKeel advanced to play at Calary Christian at 7 p.m. on Feb. 10 in the regional semifinals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Ledger: Boys soccer: Lakeland Christian, Fort Meade falls, McKeel advances",

    "description": "This is a team which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",
    "fullText": "Monday’s convincing victory over Burnley has virtually guaranteed Sunderland’s Premier League status for next season, with more than a third of fixtures still to play.\n\nIt was also the sixth occasion where the squad has responded to a defeat with a win — that speaks to the mentality of the group of players who have been blended together from last season’s promotion-winning heroes and the carefully selected cohort of summer recruits.\n\nThe ability to bounce back after disappointing performances against the likes of Burnley in August, Manchester United in October and West Ham in January is testament to the belief that Régis Le Bris has instilled in what has proved to be the surprise package of the season.\n\nIt is not just the fact that this is a team full of talented players which gives the squad character. It is that the club have recruited talented players who have the right character to play for this club, and for this coach.\n\nFor a goalkeeper of his age and experience, Robin Roefs should not have the calm temperament to control his area in the manner that he does. Ahead of him, he has Nordi Mukiele whose will to win is demonstrated, not only by his galloping forays down the wing, but by his willingness to put his body on the line. Dan Ballard embodies the ‘Til the end’ mentality that dragged this team back to the Premier League, Omar Alderete has the ice-cool mentality and ruggedness of a South American gangster, and Reinildo wanders round the Academy of Light in January in a sleeveless vest, as if he was back in Mozambique.\n\nTrai Hume has continued to deliver the kind of no-nonsense, hard-as-nails performances that make his price tag the steal of the century, while Granit Xhaka patrols the midfield with the mindset of a military commander determined to deliver victory on the battlefield.\n\nBeside him, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra bring an African energy, skill, enthusiasm and joy that we haven’t seen since the days of Asamoah Gyan, while Enzo Le Fée’s creativity is only matched by his never-say-die attitude to win back the ball every single time the team loses possession.\n\nUp front, Brian Brobbey is delivering the kind of no-nonsense muscular front-man performances that the Sunderland faithful have been desperately seeking for years, shrugging off defenders like annoying flies. On the wing, Chemsdine Talbi not only grafts back defensively but has delivered the spectacular finishes that excite crowds.\n\nAdd to that the loveable Wilson Isidor, Wembley hero Eliezer Mayenda and ‘Mr Sunderland’ Luke O’Nien, and this is a group of players who deserve to be celebrated.\n\nAfter years of watching the likes of Jack Rodwell and others stealing a living from the club, and giving nothing for the badge, let alone everything, this is such a refreshing change. And that is why the fact that the club has only recruited three new players in January should not be a concern.\n\nThe recruitment team have set out their stall. If you want to play for Sunderland, the first question is ‘Are you talented enough?’ If the answer to that is ‘Yes’, the next question is ‘Are you the right type of player, do you have the right mentality?’\n\nRecruiting players who can answer ‘Yes’ to those questions is precisely why we can now spend the last third of the season worrying about how high this squad might finish in the Premier League, rather than whether we will still be in it in August.\n\nLook around at other sides who have prioritised ability over attitude, who have put together a group of players, rather than a team. It is the same approach that allowed Leicester City to achieve the improbable, if not the impossible, by winning the Premier League a decade ago.\n\nThis is a team — the only team unbeaten at home in the Premier League — which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",

    "title": "High school boys basketball: American Fork earns another convincing win over Lone Peak",
    "description": "Jax Clark and Bryce Mella were among American Fork’s standouts in their rematch against Lone Peak on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "One of the state’s biggest rivalries, American Fork and Lone Peak, tipped off Tuesday night. Just as it did a few weeks ago, American Fork got the last laugh.\n\nIt was close at times, but the Cavemen never trailed and earned a convincing 58-48 road win.\n\nThe defense was huge for American Fork in the first half. It forced six turnovers in the opening quarter. The Cavemen forced Lone Peak to take the shots they wanted, which resulted in only 20 points at halftime.\n\nMeanwhile, American Fork’s Jax Clark and Bryce Mella worked to get the Cavemen high-quality shots at the rim. It wasn’t until late in the second quarter that American Fork finally got a 3-pointer from Bridger Burnside. That wasn’t because they couldn’t shoot, but largely because they were getting shot in the paint.\n\nClark ended with a team-high 15 points while Mella added 11.\n\n“I think one thing we’ve really worked hard on in practice is keeping a guy in front of us and trying to defend without fouling, that’s a big deal for us,” said American Fork head coach Ryan Cuff. “When we do get fouls called on us, it’s just because we get caught up trying to reach and things like that. So it’s just making our opponent take tough shots, and that’s another thing that we’ve worked really hard on in practice.”\n\nWhile American Fork never trailed in the win, Lone Peak gave it a scare in the fourth quarter. The Knights’ Crew Fotheringham and Skyler Andreoli made some shots down low to bring it within six points.\n\nWith no hesitation, American Fork kept going to Dieter Tuitavuki in the corner. That proved successful as Tuitavuki connected on two shots from distance to put Lone Peak away. He ended the night with an efficient 14 points off the bench, including four 3-pointers.\n\n“That kid is ready all the time when called upon,” Cuff said. “We’ve had him play some JV just to continue to give him some confidence. He’s just a sophomore, but to come in a big game like that and just being game-ready, those are shots that we expect anybody to pop if they’re open and he has that green light and he knows it. We’re just proud of him.”\n\nThe win was a big deal in terms of Region 3 standings for American Fork. The Cavemen keep sole control of the region and could guarantee an outright region title with a win over Corner Canyon on Friday.\n\n“We still have a big road in front of us, and we recognize that and recognize how much harder we have to work and come together,” Cuff said. “A hostile environment, it’s what we needed right now. Proud of them for just keeping their composure and being able to finish strong.”",

    "fullText": "Eyewitness News has learned the murder of former NFL player Kevin Johnson may be connected to three separate murders of homeless people living in encampments along the L.A. River near Willowbrook, sometimes called Compton Creek.\n\nAll four homicides occurred in the same general location in the 1300 block of East 120th Street between October 2025 and January 2026. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department noted that all four victims were unhoused individuals who were living in encampments in the area.\n\nJohnson's body was found at a homeless encampment next to Compton Creek on Jan. 21. His cause of death was listed as \"blunt head trauma\" and \"stab wounds,\" and the manner of death was ruled a homicide, according to L.A. County Medical Examiner records.\n\nORIGINAL REPORT: Former NFL player Kevin Johnson stabbed to death at LA homeless encampment\n\nFormer NFL player Kevin Johnson was found dead at a homeless encampment in the Los Angeles area. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.\n\nAccording to sources close to the investigation, the string of murders in the Compton Creek area began on Oct. 5, 2025, when a woman, identified as 52-year-old Michelle Steele, was shot in the head. She died in the hospital on Nov. 12, 2025.\n\nThree weeks later, on Dec. 4, a homeless man identified as 52-year-old Octavio Arias was murdered in the same area. According to L.A. County Medical Examiner records, Arias died from head and neck trauma.\n\nThe fourth victim, following the murder of Kevin Johnson, was identified as Mauro Alfaro, also in his 50s. According to sources, Alfaro was killed on Jan. 26, and the cause of death was blunt force trauma.\n\nThe L.A. County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau says investigators are now looking into the possibility that all four murders were done by the same killer. A suspect has not been identified.\n\nDetectives are still trying to determine motives in the killings and trying to figure out if the suspect is someone who is upset with homeless people being in that area, or if drugs or gangs may be involved. Sources say there is no concrete evidence linking the cases together.\n\nEight detectives are working the case, and say they are having a hard time getting information from the homeless population in the area. County workers have been conducting outreach in the area, trying to get the homeless population to move out into other housing.\n\nAnyone with information should call homicide detectives at 323-890-5500 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS(8477).\n\nJohnson, a native of L.A., played for the Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders from 1995 to 1997.\n\nAfter his career in the NFL ended, he played in the Arena Football League with the Orlando Predators and L.A. Avengers.",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "fullText": "Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United has once again been subject to major speculation, particularly after certain details of his contract were revealed.\n\nThe 31-year-old’s contract with Man Utd runs until 2027, meaning the club only has this summer to pocket a massive transfer fee if their talisman is to leave.\n\nFernandes has been heavily linked with a move to Saudi Arabia, where interested clubs were willing to part ways with a staggering £100 million to lure him across the desert.\n\nThat didn’t materialise, but they could get another chance to snap him up at slightly more than half their initial valuation of the Portuguese international midfielder.\n\nAccording to Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Fernandes has a stunning £57m release clause in his contract, but it can only be triggered by clubs outside the Premier League.\n\nThere’s no doubt that this would be a massive blow for United if Fernandes leaves the club this summer, particularly for a fee that doesn’t fully reflect his status at Old Trafford.\n\nFernandes has been a cornerstone of United’s midfield since joining from Sporting CP in January 2020.\n\nThe Portuguese midfielder will go down as one of the most iconic winter additions after establishing himself as the creative engine of the team.\n\nFernandes was handed the captain’s armband in 2023 by then-manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nMore than 300 appearances later, his durability and work rate remain remarkable. Fernandes has scored 103 goals and provided 99 assists in a United shirt over the past six years.\n\nThis season, he has already bagged five goals and 12 assists in the Premier League. He also has one assist in a massively disappointing FA Cup campaign.\n\nIn a side that is still struggling to find the consistency that re-establishes them firmly in the upper echelons of English football, Fernandes is still one of the few reliable performers.\n\nDespite his importance, the Portuguese midfielder has repeatedly been heavily linked with a move away and reportedly came close to leaving the club in the summer of 2025.\n\nFernandes claimed some members of United’s top brass wanted him out of the club after receiving a mouth-watering sum from Saudi Pro League (SPL) powerhouse Al Hilal.\n\n“The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head,” he said. “I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club.\n\n“From the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot.\n\n“More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all.”\n\nFernandes added to his tally in the most recent 3-2 victory against Fulham, setting up Casemiro for the opener before assisting Benjamin Sesko for the last-minute winner.\n\nThat brace of assists took him up to 12 for the season. He’s on course to beat David Beckham’s record for most assists in a Premier League season by a United player, which has stood for 26 years (15 in 1999/00).\n\nIf he maintains his current form, he could also match Kevin De Bruyne and Thierry Henry’s joint record for most assists in a Premier League season (20).\n\nFernandes has proven his worth time and again, but he could finally leave the club this summer after the exit clause in his contract was made public.\n\nThere are rumours that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) is plotting another raid on Europe’s top five leagues, and Fernandes could be one of those to move across the desert.\n\nIf that happens, it’ll undoubtedly be a massive blow for United, particularly if they fail to bring in a player who can fill the void Fernandes’ exit would leave.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Clippers made a stunning move ahead of Thursday's trade deadline, sending James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Darius Garland and a second-round pick in what ESPN's Shams Charania is calling one of the biggest swaps in recent deadline history.\n\nThe trade comes as a surprise considering the Clippers (23-26) had gone 17-4 since Dec. 20 and appeared to be rounding into form, with Harden playing a huge part in that impressive turnaround by carrying the team through injuries early in the season and keeping them afloat when it mattered the most.\n\nHe's been averaging 25.4 points and 8.1 assists per game while helping the team climb back into the Western Conference playoff picture, and the Cavaliers (30-21) are now hoping the move will boost their title chances after falling off from last season's 64-win campaign.\n\nFor Los Angeles, the math here is pretty simple: Harden is 36 years old and was looking for a new deal, while Garland is a 26-year-old two-time All-Star who gives them something they desperately needed in a future.\n\nBREAKING: The Los Angeles Clippers are trading James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Darius Garland and a second-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Prolific swap of the star point guards. pic.twitter.com/IHhhhabJnX\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 4, 2026\n\nThe Clippers entered this season with the NBA's oldest roster and no control over their next four first-round picks, so their championship window with this core had likely closed and getting younger became a priority.\n\nGarland averaged 20.6 points and 6.7 assists last season while shooting 40% from three, and he's under contract through 2027-28.\n\nESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported that Harden had recently spoken about feeling \"blessed\" to play in his hometown of Los Angeles, but she noted this was a business decision for all involved and that everyone knew how tradeable the partial guarantee on the second year of Harden's contract made him.\n\nThe structure of his deal gave him veto power over any trade, but he worked with the team to find a landing spot that suited both sides.\n\nGarland has dealt with toe injuries that limited him to just 26 games this season, and there are concerns about his durability going forward since he hasn't played since Jan. 14 due to a Grade 1 sprain of his right big toe.\n\nGarland last 15 games before getting hurt\n20/2/7.3 on 52/42/85 shooting , and less than 3 turnovers in 31MPG\n\nAbility isn’t the issue. He’s a demon with the ball.\n\n— Mark Thompson (@mathomp_501) February 4, 2026\n\nStill, when healthy, he's shown he can be one of the better point guards in the league.\n\nHead coach Tyronn Lue was asked about the situation before Monday's loss to Philadelphia and said Harden \"means a lot\" to the franchise, adding when asked if he hoped Harden would remain past the deadline: \"Who wouldn't want to have James Harden?\"\n\nThe timing creates an interesting wrinkle since Cleveland coincidentally plays the Clippers on Wednesday night at Intuit Dome, and Garland traveled with the team to Los Angeles knowing both players will need to pass physicals before the trade becomes official.\n\nDarius Garland as a Cav:\n\n— 18.8 PPG\n— 6.7 APG\n— 1.1 SPG\n— 2x All-Star\n\nTop 3 in franchise history in assists and threes. pic.twitter.com/htVc3yAGxi\n\n— StatMuse (@statmuse) February 4, 2026\n\nFor Los Angeles, this move signals a shift in direction, and instead of going all-in with an aging roster, they're betting on Garland to help them compete now while also being part of the next chapter of the franchise.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City host Newcastle United at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday while they aim to defend a 2–0 aggregate lead and reach their 10th EFL Cup final.\n\nThe Citizens have moved into a commanding position in this tie thanks to goals from Antoine Semenyo and Rayan Cherki in the first leg. While the squad has been hit by a string of defensive injuries, manager Pep Guardiola will be confident in his side’s historical dominance at home against the Magpies. A result tonight would also see them move past a frustrating domestic weekend and focus on a potential trip to Wembley. Notably, only one team in history has ever overturned a two-goal first-leg deficit to reach the final.\n\nPep Guardiola manages a squad dealing with several long-term absences but welcomes back key cup performers. Notably, Rayan Cherki is expected to start despite picking up a knock over the weekend; he aims to become the first City player since Yaya Touré to score in four consecutive EFL Cup games. However, Marc Guéhi is cup-tied and ineligible, while Jeremy Doku and Joško Gvardiol remain sidelined. Consequently, Guardiola is likely to rely on the experience of Nathan Aké and Rodri to stabilise the side.\n\nJames Trafford is poised to start in goal, protected by a backline that should include Abdukhodir Khusanov and Matheus Nunes. In midfield, the emerging Nico O’Reilly could partner Rodri, allowing Bernardo Silva to operate in a more advanced role. Erling Haaland is expected to lead the attack, supported by Semenyo and Cherki, as City look to end their recent second-half slumps.\n\nManchester City predicted XI: Trafford; Nunes, Khusanov, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Bernardo; Semenyo, Haaland\n\nThe Carabao Cup semi-final fixture takes place at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, 4 February 2026.

    "fullText": "Manchester City welcome Newcastle United to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night for the decisive second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, holding a commanding 2–0 aggregate lead.\n\nStrikes from Antoine Semenyo and Rayan Cherki at St James’ Park three weeks ago have put the Citizens in the driving seat to reach their 10th EFL Cup final. However, Pep Guardiola’s men arrive with questions to answer following a frustrating weekend draw at Tottenham, where they surrendered a two-goal half-time lead.\n\nFor the defending champions, Newcastle, the task is monumental; they must become only the second team in the competition’s history to overturn a two-goal first-leg deficit to reach the final. While Eddie Howe remains defiant, his squad is weathering a storm of injuries and a dip in away form that saw them fall 4–1 at Liverpool last weekend.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 4 February 2026\n\nVenue: Etihad Stadium, Manchester\n\nLast Meeting: Newcastle United 0–2 Manchester City (13 Jan 2026) League Cup\n\nPep Guardiola is monitoring the fitness of playmaker Rayan Cherki, who sustained a knock against Spurs but is expected to feature. While Rúben Dias has returned to first-team training, he is not yet match-fit. The Citizens remain without Jeremy Doku (calf), Joško Gvardiol (tibial fracture), John Stones (thigh), and Savinho. January signing Marc Guéhi is ineligible for this fixture. James Trafford is expected to start in goal.\n\nEddie Howe confirmed that captain Bruno Guimarães and young midfielder Lewis Miley are both expected to miss the trip to Manchester. They join a lengthy absentee list including Joelinton (groin), Tino Livramento (hamstring), Fabian Schär (ankle), and Emil Krafth (knee). However, Sven Botman is fit and available for selection. Sandro Tonali is likely to lead a depleted three-man midfield.\n\nThe Citizens have made the Etihad a fortress, and they enter this tie having won 17 of their last 18 home games against Newcastle across all competitions. Notably, City have struggled to maintain leads recently; in 2026, they have conceded six second-half goals in the Premier League without scoring once themselves. Despite this, Rayan Cherki remains in peak cup form, having scored in all three of his EFL Cup appearances this term.\n\nThe Magpies’ 10-game winning run in the EFL Cup, dating back to 2024, was ended by City in the first leg. Their road form has also dipped, highlighted by the recent heavy defeat at Anfield. Notably, Newcastle are looking to avoid becoming only the third EFL Cup holders to be eliminated at the semi-final stage. Anthony Gordon remains their primary creative outlet, leading the team with six chances created in the competition this season.\n\nManchester City Predicted XI: Trafford; Nunes, Khusanov, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Bernardo; Semenyo, Haaland\n\nNewcastle United Predicted XI: Pope; Trippier, Thiaw, Burn, Hall; Willock, Tonali, Ramsey; Barnes, Wissa, Gordon\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Football, and Sky Ultra HD.

    "fullText": "Newcastle United travel to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, aiming to secure a historic comeback and keep their Carabao Cup title defence alive.\n\nThe Magpies face a defining challenge tonight as they attempt to overturn a 2–0 aggregate deficit against Manchester City. Eddie Howe demands his side replicate the spirit that delivered the trophy last year. However, they must achieve this feat at a venue where they historically struggle. Having seen their 10-game cup winning streak snapped by City in the first leg, the visitors now battle to avoid becoming only the third holders to exit at the semi-final stage.\n\nEddie Howe navigates a severe injury crisis across the pitch. Significantly, captain Bruno Guimarães misses out after failing to recover from an ankle knock. He joins Joelinton and Tino Livramento in the treatment room. Consequently, Sandro Tonali and Jacob Ramsey must shoulder the midfield burden.\n\nOn a positive note, Sven Botman passes his fitness test to lead the defence. Nick Pope retains his place in goal, protected by a backline featuring Malick Thiaw and Dan Burn. Furthermore, Joe Willock steps into the engine room to replace Guimarães. In attack, Anthony Gordon remains vital on the wing alongside Harvey Barnes. Yoane Wissa is expected to lead the line as the Magpies target early goals to unsettle a City defence that has displayed vulnerability in 2026.\n\nNewcastle predicted XI: Pope; Trippier, Thiaw, Burn, Hall; Willock, Tonali, Ramsey; Barnes, Wissa, Gordon\n\nThe Carabao Cup semi-final fixture takes place at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, 4 February 2026.

    "fullText": "Real Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa has had a rollercoaster start to his tenure at the Bernabeu as senior manager, and internally that has been the case too. Exiting the Copa del Rey at the hands of Albacete in his first game, and dropping out of the top eight in the Champions League, Arbeloa has managed to cut the gap to Barcelona in La Liga down to one point.\n\nEarlier this week it was reported that Arbeloa has improved the atmosphere in the dressing room, and the tension that was present during Xabi Alonso’s spell has died down. Cadena SER say the club believe that their decision to change manager was worthwhile. Arbeloa has made a point of getting close to his players, and some even believe that he has gone over the top with that objective.\n\nHowever some of his decisions have surprised the Real Madrid dressing room. During their 4-2 defeat to Benfica, some of the players were surprised that Dani Ceballos did not make it off the bench, while Castilla talent Jorge Cestero was sent on for the final stages. Said players ‘let Arbeloa know about it’, and it is possible he was keen to placate them, with Ceballos coming on at half-time against Rayo Vallecano.\n\nTheir information continues on to say that Arbeloa has not installed any radical tactical changes, with the Real Madrid squad expecting more from him. Arbeloa was delayed in giving his press conference on Sunday after a 2-1 win over Rayo Vallecano, and this was due to a long and tense discussion between Arbeloa and the players, who did not see eye-to-eye with some of his substitutions and tactical choices.\n\nAs such, the feeling from the dressing room is that they are being trained by the Castilla manager rather than the long-term solution for the bench at the Bernabeu. Arbeloa is seen as an interim option, who could be moved on in the summer.\n\nArbeloa and returning fitness coach Antonio Pintus are now approaching a critical period of two midweeks without games, which will be their best opportunity to implement any changes on the training ground. Without notable improvement, Arbeloa’s position will only weaken as the weeks pass.",

    "fullText": "Known Chelsea fan Paul Merson says he is numb after watching the approach and setup by Chelsea in the defeat to Arsenal last night.\n\nHead coach Liam Rosenior has been criticised for going too defensive against Arsenal despite being 3-2 down from the first leg. Chelsea ended up losing the game 1-0 on the night, and 4-2 on aggregate over both legs.\n\nOther than Joao Pedro up top, who earned praise from Gary Neville, and a couple of others, Chelsea were just not really up to the task last night.\n\nRosenior went with a back three formation from the off, using a compact setup that featured no wingers in it from the off. It was a setup designed for stability and to contain, trying to stop Arsenal from scoring another goal and becoming more impossible to catch. But the issue was, it was Chelsea who needed a goal to keep the tie alive, and Arsenal were happy to just contain themselves. It made it an edge and pretty uneventful game to watch really.\n\nMerson is a passionate Blues fan, so it’s always good to see what he has to say after games.\n\nCole Palmer’s free kick hits the wall. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\n“I’m numb. I’m flabbergasted,” said Merson. “I can’t believe what I just watched.\n\nI honestly can’t believe what I just watched. This is Chelsea Football Club. They’ve got international football players. They’ve got a World Cup winner [Enzo Fernandez]. They’ve got players all over.\n\n“This is not a bottom four, bottom five team. He [Wesley Fofana] is crying. He should be crying because they never had a go.\n\n“I’m lost for words. I cannot believe what happened. They’ve just gone out with an absolute whimper, in the semi-final of a big competition. If it worked it was great, but it hasn’t worked and you can’t gamble like that.\n\n“Have a go and go out in a blaze of glory. Don’t go out like that. I’m lost for words. Honestly, I’m lost for words.”\n\nMerson’s fellow Sky pundit Jamie Redknapp said: “In semi-finals, it’s just a completely different thing altogether. You’ve got to throw caution to the wind.\n\n“You’ve got to get the ball into the box. You’ve got to be thinking, no regrets after this game. There will be a lot of regrets in that dressing room, thinking we didn’t do enough.”\n\nQuotes via The Evening Standard.",

    "description": "Harden clears the air on his exit from Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "James Harden is a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers. A few hours after news of the trade became public, he spoke with ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne. In that conversation, he said that he didn’t ask for a trade from the Los Angeles Clippers and that he’s “excited about Cleveland.”\n\nJust spoke to a reflective James Harden, who denied asking for a trade and thanked the Clippers for the opportunity to play the last two and a half years in his hometown. “In life, not even just basketball, when things don't work out, there are ways to end things in relationships…\n\n— Ramona Shelburne (@ramonashelburne) February 4, 2026\n\nHarden on his exit from Los Angeles:\n\n“In life, not even just basketball, when things don’t work out, there are ways to end things in relationships without having to crack each other. Okay, maybe we just don’t see a future with each other. Maybe we just outgrew each other, whatever the case may be. I feel like other situations weren’t like that. And that’s why I can respect Steve and L and TLu because they didn’t put me in a weird position as much as everybody tried to make it like that.”\n\n“[I] didn’t want to feel like I was holding the Clippers up in their future. I wanted them to actually have a chance to rebuild and get some draft capital. In Cleveland I see an opportunity to win in the East— they got a very good team, coaching staff, all of the above. So as much as I wanted to stay in LA and give it a go—I’ve never won one before. As a basketball mind I think we have a bit better chance.”\n\nHarden concluded the conversation with:\n\n“At the end of the day it is a business and I think both sides got what they wanted, are in a great place and are very happy. I’m excited about Cleveland —I’m still trying to chase my first championship and do whatever it takes to win.”\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Harden and Donovan Mitchell have already “connected” and are “very excited” for the partnership.\n\nJoining @SportsCenter @ Night on how 11-time All-Star James Harden lands in Cleveland to partner with Donovan Mitchell on a title pursuit: pic.twitter.com/dTMUEJtUFE\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 4, 2026\n\nIt’s good to get Harden’s perspective on some of this immediately after the trade. Even though the Clippers were playing well lately, it was difficult to see them as true title contenders. His exit, at least based on his statement, would suggest that the move wasn’t motivated just by money, but a desire to compete.\n\nHarden also made clear that he thinks he can win with the Cavs. The Eastern Conference is wide open. And this might be Harden’s last, best chance to win a championship. We’ll see if he — and the Cavs — can make the most of this opportunity.",

    "description": "FC Bayern is winning as a team.",
    "fullText": "Individual awards like the Ballon d’Or are often framed as personal milestones, but Joshua Kimmich’s comments on Harry Kane reveal why that conversation looks different inside Bayern Munich. For all of Kane’s goals, records, and global reputation, his greatest strength may be how little he appears to chase individual recognition.\n\n“The goal is to achieve things as a team to make it possible for him to win individual awards. But generally speaking, when he’s on the pitch, I don’t get the impression that he’s playing for individual awards, he’s a very complete player and plays for the team’s success,” Kimmich said (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “I’ve never seen him sad in the dressing room because we won 3-0 and he didn’t score. He’s also someone who wants to put his teammates in the spotlight. This mix makes him very special and extremely valuable to us.”\n\nThat perspective cuts to the heart of Kane’s impact at Bayern Munich. He is the focal point of the attack, yet rarely behaves like one. Goals matter — and he delivers them relentlessly — but they are never pursued at the expense of structure, rhythm, or teammates. Kane drops deep, links play, creates space, and celebrates others’ success with the same enthusiasm as his own.\n\nIn a squad full of winners, that mentality carries real weight. Bayern’s dressing room is built on collective accountability, not stat-padding, and Kane fits that ethos naturally. His leadership is subtle but powerful: calm reactions, selflessness in big moments, and an obvious commitment to the group.\n\nIf Kane does eventually lift the Ballon d’Or, it likely won’t be because he chased it. As Kimmich makes clear, it will be because Bayern succeeded together — and because Kane embodies exactly the kind of player individual awards are supposed to honor.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — The USC Trojans played yet another tightrope game against a Big Ten opponent, but this time managed to end on a positive note.\n\nHead coach Eric Musselman and his squad welcomed the 15-7 Indiana Hoosiers into the Galen Center Tuesday night and managed to escape with an 81-75 victory.\n\nShots were falling left and right for the Trojans' offense to begin the con, as they managed to make their first seven shot attempts and shut down the Hoosiers attempt to get anything going with stellar defense in the paint within the first 10 minutes of regulation.\n\nFreshman Alijah Arenas rejoined the team on January 21 against the Northwestern Wildcats and, since then, has been on a steady upclimb to knock off the rust of sitting out for the last couple of months.\n\nHe started off the first half as Southern California's leader in points (10) on some lopsided shooting attempts (3-13).\n\nNonetheless, his performance against the Hoosiers would be a step in the right direction as he notched a career high of 29 points on 9-23 shooting from the floor and five rebounds.\n\nFollowing the win, coach Musselman said he doesn't regret starting Arenas in his first game back when USC played Northwestern some weeks ago and forgoed settling him in traditionally, knowing he would only need just a handful of games to get his groove back.\n\nMusselman called Arenas' performance \"pretty damn impressive,\" considering that the 18-year-old has just a handful of games at the collegiate level under his belt.\n\nArenas credited his team for his upbringing at the college level, and also gave his flowers to Kam Woods, whom Arenas credits for his shooting performance as of late.\n\n\"Without my team, I kind of start losing myself, which is why I am grateful to have them,\" Arenas said.\n\nWoods also had a great night on the floor, shooting 6-12 from the floor and notching 18 points, along with six rebounds to his credit.\n\nWoods and Arenas had to pick up the majority of the offensive baggage as leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara went down with an ankle injury in the second half and had to be helped off the court.\n\nHe would later reappear with crutches and an ice pack on his knee as he sat down on the sidelines.\n\nMusselman gave no concrete update on the condition of Chad Baker-Mazara's injury, but assumes he has a sprained MCL, and won't know until Baker-Mazara gets an MRI soon.\n\nChad Baker-Mazara is back on the sidelines with crutches after being helped off the court earlier in the second half.\n\nHis night is presumably done. pic.twitter.com/KeXKMxhsUz\n\n— Adrian Medina (@AdrianMedina_16) February 4, 2026\n\nDespite the loss of Baker-Mazara, the Trojans were able to keep the Hoosiers' field goal percentage a tick above 40 percent, and a clutch block by Ryan Cornish during Indiana's final shot attempt was the final nail in the coffin, as USC came away with their sixth conference win.\n\nThe Trojans have some time before their next contest, as they head out to play the Penn State Cougars on Super Bowl Sunday.",

The French world champion is now indeed moving to Fenerbahçe. \"Giving up is not an option for us,\" the club initially tweeted before the transfer was officially announced two hours later.\n\nAfter the Turkish club had announced at noon that the deal had failed (you can read it again here), the transfer chaos is now complete. However, since the transfer window in Turkey is open longer, the transfer can still go through.\n\nKanté signs a contract until 2028 and is part of a swap deal. In return, Youssef En-Nesyri moves to Kanté's former club Al Ittihad. According to media reports, the Saudis are paying 15 million euros, and Kanté is moving to Istanbul on a free transfer.\n\nThe Frenchman is said to have previously refused to participate in training at Al Ittihad to force his transfer.

    "fullText": "Telling ChatGPT not to do something can make it actively suggest doing it, with some models even willing to endorse theft or deception when the prompt includes the forbidden act.\n\nLike me, you may have come across a strange phenomenon with Large Language Models (LLMs) whereby they don’t just ignore a specific instruction you gave, which included a prohibition (i.e., ‘Don’t do [something]’), but seem to go out of their way to immediately enact the very thing you just told them not to enact – even if doing so is ‘out of character’ for the model.\n\nThis is a known feature even of older NLP models; and a growing strand of research regarding LLMs’ negation capabilities has emerged in recent years.\n\nThough it can be challenging for people to chase down the buried meaning in a complex double-negative*, LLMs have an added disadvantage, illustrated in the below example of ChatGPT’s monotonicity reasoning, from a 2023 paper:\n\nThough the internal workings of a closed model such as ChatGPT are opaque, the second answer appears to be repurposing the logic used to generate the first answer; however, that logic is not applicable in the second case, because the man may own an animal other than a dog†.\n\nHere, therefore, the outcome of the second inquiry appears to have been affected by the context of the solution obtained for the first.\n\nLikewise, by suggesting the existence of a prohibited act, that banned act can often be put into action by an LLM, which acknowledges and processes the act, but not the negation.\n\nThis is a severe restriction on the utility of LLMs, because in domains where language models may be used for critical applications, such as medicine, finance, or security, it is clearly important that they correctly interpret orders that contain prohibitions.\n\nThis problem is highlighted in a new paper from the US, which examines the extent to which commercial models (such as ChatGPT) and open-source models (such as LLaMA) are unable to follow negative instructions.\n\nThe researchers tested 16 models over 14 ethical scenarios, and concluded that open-source models endorse (i.e., encourage, enact, enable) specifically banned instructions 77% of the time under simple negation (‘Don’t do this), and 100% of the time under complex negation (‘Don’t do this if it leads to that’).\n\nWhile commercial models fared better, only Gemini-3-Flash achieved the top rating in a new Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) scale proposed by the paper (though Grok 4.1 ran a close second).\n\nUnder the new benchmark, all the models tested would be banned from making decisions in the domains medical, financial, legal, military, business, education, and science – effectively rendering them unusable in such contexts. Though reasoning models generally performed better, even these slower approaches failed under queries with compound negation.\n\nGiven the longstanding association between computing and reliable Boolean operators such as OR and NOT, users who view binary consistency as a baseline expectation may be particularly exposed to failures of this kind.\n\nCommenting on the difficulty that open-source LLMs have in parsing negated queries, the authors state:\n\n‘Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones […]\n\n‘The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish “do X” from “do not X” should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.’\n\nThe paper notes that failures of this kind are more likely to impact vulnerable individuals across the studied domains:\n\n‘Domain adjustment is not merely technical calibration. Rather, it has equity implications.\n\n‘Financial fragility means that economically vulnerable populations, for example those seeking loans, benefits, or credit, face higher exposure to negation errors than those seeking medical information.’\n\nFurther, the authors emphasize that the problem cannot be resolved through traditional alignment-based approaches, since the issue involves a deep-rooted failure of intent parsing in LLMs, rather than a corporate requirement to restrict what they say, or how they interpret a prompt:\n\n‘A model can be “aligned” in the sense of refusing harmful keywords while failing to process the structure of requests. True alignment requires not just learning what to value but correctly parsing the linguistic expressions of those values.\n\n‘Until that capability is reliable, “do not” should mean “do not.”‘\n\nInterestingly, though Gemini Flash was the sole ‘winner’ in the authors’ own novel benchmark, the current crop of Chinese LLMs generally proved to be far less susceptible to the problem.\n\nThe new paper is titled When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models, and comes from two researchers at Kenyon College in Ohio.\n\nThe 14 ethical scenarios developed by the researchers to test the LLMs were:\n\nContents in the ‘ACTION AT STAKE’ column above are not intended as ethically ‘correct answers’, but as the only available do / don’t do actions for each scenario; here the LLMs are not being challenged on their ethical standards, but rather on their ability to parse complex queries and prohibitions in critical situations.\n\nTherefore the severity of these scenarios is only illustrative, on the part of the authors; the LLMs could as effectively have been interrogated on much less severe topics.\n\nThe US commercial models tested for the work were GPT-5.1; GPT-5.2; GPT-5-mini; Claude-Haiku-4.5; Claude-Sonnet-4.5; Gemini-3-Flash; Grok-4.1-non-reasoning; and Grok-4.1-reasoning.\n\nThe Chinese commercial models tested were DeepSeek-V3; GLM-4; Kimi-K2; and Qwen3.\n\nThe open-source models used were LLaMA-3.2-1B; Gemma-3-4B; Granite-3.3-2B; and Phi-4-mini-3.8B.\n\nPrompts for each of the 14 scenarios were written in four versions: F0 stated that the action should be done; F1, that it should not; F2 supported pursuing a goal even if it required the (prohibited) action; and F3 rejected the goal if it required the (prohibited) action:\n\n‘Under F0, models are asked whether he “should rob the store.” Under F1, whether he “should not rob the store.” Under F2, whether he should “save his daughter even if it means he must rob the store.”\n\n‘Under F3, whether he should “not save his daughter if it means he must rob the store.” The admissible facts remain constant, and only polarity varies.’\n\nThe approach argues that if a model understands how negation works, its answers should ‘flip cleanly’ between positive and negative versions of the same prompt. Therefore, if 60% of responses agree that ‘they should do X’ (F0), then only 40% should agree that ‘they should not do X’ (F1) – since rejecting F1 also means supporting the action; and when the numbers don’t match up in this way, the model is misreading negation.\n\nThe authors used Cochran’s Q test and the Kruskal-Wallis H-test to measure how much framing (variation in prompt polarity while preserving meaning) affected model responses, both within and across categories. After adjusting for false positives, the authors found that in 61.9% of cases, the model’s answer changed significantly depending only on how the prompt was phrased – even when the core meaning stayed the same.\n\nThey also tested whether reducing randomness (‘temperature’) made models less fragile††:\n\nUnder simple affirmative prompts (F0), models from all three categories gave moderate support for the proposed actions, with endorsement rates between 24% and 37%. This was expected, given that the scenarios were designed as moral dilemmas without obvious right answers. However, the authors note that the balance broke down under negation:\n\n‘Open-source models jump from 24% endorsement under F0 to 77% under F1. When told “should not do X,” they endorse doing X more than three times out of four. Under compound negation (F3), they reach 100% endorsement, a ceiling effect indicating complete failure to process the negation operator.’\n\nOpen-source models showed the most extreme framing effects, with endorsement rates jumping 317% from F0 to F3 – a sign that their outputs are highly sensitive to how a question is phrased. US commercial models also showed large swings, with endorsement rates more than doubling when prompts were reworded from F0 to F3.\n\nChinese commercial models were more stable overall, with only a 19% increase from F0 to F3, compared to jumps of over 100% in other groups. More importantly, they were the only models to reduce their endorsement when a prompt was negated, suggesting they understood that saying ‘should not’ means the opposite of ‘should’:\n\nModels agreed with each other 74% of the time when prompts used affirmative wording, but only 62% when the same ideas were expressed with negation – a12-point drop suggesting that models are not trained to handle negation in a consistent way:\n\nTo measure how easily a model’s judgment can be flipped by rephrasing a prompt with negation, the authors developed the aforementioned Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) – a metric designed to quantify whether a model gives opposite answers to questions that are logically equivalent, but framed using negation.\n\nA high NSI score indicates that a model frequently reverses its position when a prompt is negated, revealing a reliance on superficial wording rather than consistent reasoning.\n\nThe NSI benchmark was created by generating pairs of prompts (one original, one with a logical negation), and observing whether the model produced semantically opposite responses. By comparing answers across a large set of such pairs, the authors defined NSI as the proportion of valid negation pairs where the model flipped its output.\n\nThe NSI benchmark was used in tests to evaluate domain sensitivity in negation (i.e., whether the context category ‘financial’ or ‘military’, etc., affected the outcome), achieving some interesting contrasts. Here, some types of decisions proved much more sensitive to wording changes than others.\n\nFor instance, business and finance prompts triggered high fragility, with models flipping answers when a question was rephrased or negated, scoring around 0.64 to 0.65 on the NSI scale. Medical prompts were more stable, averaging just 0.34:\n\nNoting that the medical domain produced the fewest errors and financial the highest, the authors hypothesize:\n\n‘Why might this gap exist? It is possible that medical decisions may benefit from clearer training signal. Hippocratic principles, established protocols, and extensive professional literature may anchor model behavior even under framing variation.\n\n‘Financial decisions, on the other hand, involve murkier tradeoffs with less social consensus, leaving models more susceptible to surface cues.’\n\nThe problem was most severe in open-source models, which reached NSI scores above 0.89 in finance, business, and military prompts. Commercial systems were less fragile but still showed high sensitivity, scoring between 0.20 and 0.75 depending on the domain:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the authors note that the heightened fragility of open-source models in this area may carry disproportionate risks for vulnerable or marginalized groups, who are more likely to be served by locally deployed systems chosen for budgetary reasons in municipal or governmental settings†††:\n\n‘If an institution deploys an open-source model for cost reasons, the burden falls disproportionately on populations already navigating precarious financial circumstances. Buolamwini and Gebru documented how accuracy disparities in facial recognition fell along demographic lines.\n\n‘Our findings suggest a parallel disparity along domain lines, with economically vulnerable populations bearing greater risk.’\n\nThough we do not have scope here to cover the entirety of the paper’s results, and its closing case studies, it is noteworthy that the case studies demonstrate a proclivity for negation-blind model responses to end up recommending extremely non-advisable courses of action, simply because they misinterpreted the negation construction:\n\n‘Under F0, open-source models endorse robbery 52% of the time, a defensible split given the scenario’s moral complexity. Under F1 (“should NOT rob”), they endorse it 100%. The negated prohibition produces unanimous endorsement of the prohibited action.\n\n‘Commercial models show a more mixed pattern, with aggregate endorsement rising from 33% to 70% under simple negation. Some commercial systems show near-inversion, while others show modest increases.\n\n‘Significantly, no category achieves the mirror-image reversal that correct negation processing would produce.’\n\nThis is one of the most interesting papers I have come across in a while, and I recommend the reader to investigate further, as there is not space here to cover all of the material presented by the authors\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the study is how frequently a user of LLMs comes across this problem, and gradually learns not to ‘put unwanted thoughts’ in their LLMs’ cogitative processes, often attempting to exclude certain undesired results by alternative means than in-prompt negation – such as user-level system prompts, long-term memory storage, or repetitive in-prompt templates that retain the objective.\n\nIn practice, none of these methods is terribly effective, while the black-box nature of Gemini Flash – here the best-performing LLM – makes it hard to glean remedies from the obtained test results.\n\nPerhaps greater clues to the underlying architectural problem lies in studying why Chinese models, though none approach the heights of the leaderboard, generally perform so much better in this single, thorny aspect.\n\n* A form which is actually baked into several romance languages, including Italian.\n\n† Even ChatGPT-4o does not make this mistake any longer.\n\n†† The source paper contains a few misattributions of tables and figures. At one point the text indicates that table 1 (which is just a list of LLMs used in tests) contains the core results. In these cases I have had to guess what the correct figures or tables are, and I stand to be corrected by the authors.\n\n††† My substitution of hyperlinks for the authors’ inline citations.\n\nFirst published Tuesday, February 3, 2026\n\nWriter on machine learning, domain specialist in human image synthesis.

    "description": "30 years of Windows widgets - from Active Desktop to the Widget Board. Six implementations, six deaths, and the scar tissue that shapes the platform you'd build on today.",
    "fullText": "The full history of Windows widgets, from 1997 to today.\n\nEvery constraint you'll hit today exists because of a specific past disaster.\n\nMicrosoft has been trying to solve the same UX problem since 1997: how to surface live information without making you launch an app. They've shipped six different implementations across nearly 30 years. Each one died from a different fundamental flaw - performance, security, screen space, privacy, engagement. And each death triggered the same reflex: containment.\n\nThe pattern goes like this. Microsoft releases widgets into the wild. Users or attackers find the breaking point. Microsoft panics, kills the feature, and ships the next version locked inside a tighter box. Active Desktop splashed HTML across the wallpaper - performance collapsed, so Vista contained widgets in a rigid sidebar. Users hated losing screen space, so Windows 7 freed gadgets to float anywhere - then a security exploit blew the whole platform apart. Windows 8 responded by locking widgets into a full-screen Start Screen nobody wanted. The cycle repeats: build, ship, backlash, kill, rebuild with more walls.\n\nUnderstanding why each containment failed tells you exactly what constraints shape the platform you'd build on today. Every design decision in the current architecture - the declarative Adaptive Cards format, the native WinUI 3 renderer, the overlay-instead-of-dock layout - exists because of a specific past disaster. The constraints you'll hit when building widgets today aren't arbitrary. They're scar tissue.\n\nInternet Explorer 4.0 shipped in 1997 with a component called the Windows Desktop Update. It fused the Trident rendering engine into explorer.exe, turning the Windows wallpaper from a static bitmap into a live HTML surface. Microsoft called it Active Desktop.\n\nThe most visible piece was the Active Channel Bar - a vertical strip docked to the right edge of the screen, populated with branded buttons for Disney, MSNBC, Warner Bros, and CNN. Each button represented a \"Channel,\" a website that pushed content to your machine for offline reading. The backbone was Channel Definition Format (CDF), an XML standard that told your PC which pages to download and when.\n\nA small red sparkle called the \"Gleam\" appeared on a channel's icon when new content arrived. It was an early attempt at the notification patterns we now take for granted. The handpicked channel lineup drew antitrust complaints, but the real killer was more mundane.\n\nPentium I/II processors with 16–32 MB of RAM buckled under a constantly running HTML renderer. Because Trident was fused into the shell, a crash in Active Desktop crashed all of explorer.exe. Users saw a white HTML recovery screen where their wallpaper should have been. Disk I/O from background syncs ground hard drives to a halt, degrading everything else running on the machine.\n\n\"Disable Active Desktop\" became the top tuning tip for Windows 98.\n\nMicrosoft had discovered its first widget lesson: ambient information cannot cost performance.\n\nThe widget concept went dormant during the XP years, then resurfaced inside the troubled \"Longhorn\" project. The original 2002 vision was ambitious - a translucent sidebar meant to replace the system tray entirely. After Longhorn collapsed and was reset in 2004, the scope shrank. What shipped with Windows Vista in January 2007 was a supplementary pane: a dark, semi-transparent strip running the full height of the right edge of the screen.\n\nThe sidebar was a showcase for Aero Glass. The default clock gadget had a sweeping red second hand behind a reflective glass face. The CPU meter mimicked luxury car dashboard dials - metallic bezels, needles that jittered physically as load spiked, turning red as they approached 100%. Eleven gadgets shipped in total, and thousands more followed.\n\nThe problem was physical. Most monitors in 2007 were 4:3 or 5:4, and the sidebar permanently consumed around 150 pixels of horizontal space. On a 1280x1024 display, that's over 10% of your workspace. Power users disabled it on day one. The sidebar.exe process compounded the issue - it leaked memory steadily, consuming 50–100 MB on systems where 1 GB of RAM was the minimum spec.\n\nMicrosoft had attempted containment: give widgets a fixed home, keep things tidy. But rigid docking doesn't work when screen space is scarce.\n\nWindows 7 freed the gadgets. Microsoft dropped the sidebar container entirely, renamed the feature Desktop Gadgets, and let users drag widgets anywhere on screen. Gadgets snapped magnetically to screen edges and to each other. A new \"Aero Peek\" button in the taskbar made all windows transparent on hover, so you could glance at your gadgets without minimizing your work.\n\nThe third-party ecosystem exploded. DeviantArt and WinCustomize communities produced GPU temperature monitors, Winamp remote controls, elaborate calendar suites. It was the golden age of desktop customization.\n\nIt was also a security catastrophe hiding in plain sight.\n\nDesktop gadgets ran as HTML Applications with full local machine trust. No sandbox. A gadget could read files, write to the registry, and execute system commands.\n\nIn July 2012, at Black Hat in Las Vegas, researchers Mickey Shkatov and Toby Kohlenberg presented \"We Have You By The Gadgets.\" The attack chain was elegant and devastating: intercept the HTTP traffic of a weather gadget on a shared network, inject JavaScript into the XML data stream, use that JavaScript to instantiate an ActiveX control like WScript.Shell, then execute arbitrary code on the target machine. A weather widget became a backdoor.\n\n▶ Black Hat 2012: \"We Have You By The Gadgets\" - the presentation that killed Desktop Gadgets.\n\nThe researchers also demonstrated a distribution vector - since .gadget files were just renamed ZIPs, an attacker could package a trojan inside a seemingly innocent clock skin. Users would install it without triggering antivirus warnings, because the code executed within the trusted sidebar.exe process.\n\nMicrosoft's response was nuclear. By the time Windows 8 launched in October 2012, the entire gadget engine was ripped from the codebase. Freedom without a sandbox was a death sentence. Everything Microsoft built after this moment was shaped by the security lesson. The move to declarative Adaptive Cards - JSON that describes a UI, never executes code - exists because of Black Hat 2012.\n\nWindows 8 made a radical bet: tiles ARE the launcher. The Start Menu disappeared, replaced by a full-screen Start Screen - a grid of rectangular tiles that doubled as widgets. When \"live,\" a tile flipped or slid to reveal content: unread email counts, weather forecasts, news headlines.\n\nThe technology was elegant. Apps pushed tiny XML payloads through Windows Notification Services (WNS) to update their tiles without running a background process. Battery impact was near zero. Developers chose from a predefined catalog of XML templates - TileWideSmallImageAndText03 and friends - which enforced visual consistency but prevented any custom layout.\n\nThe user experience was a disaster. On a desktop PC, checking your weather tile meant leaving your work, entering the full-screen Start Screen, then navigating back. That context switch enraged productivity users. Enterprise customers called it a dealbreaker.\n\nThere was a deeper problem. Tiles were read-only. You couldn't check off a to-do, pause a song, or reply to a message from the tile. Clicking always launched the full app. Compared to the interactive gadgets of Windows 7 - where you could type notes, adjust sliders, and control media players directly on the desktop - this felt like a clear regression.\n\nWindows 10 tried a compromise - tiles went back into a traditional Start Menu. But third-party developers never invested in WNS backends. Building a live tile meant setting up a cloud service to format XML payloads and push them through Microsoft's notification infrastructure - a nontrivial cost for a feature most users barely noticed. By 2020, Start Menus were filled with static, lifeless squares. When Windows 11 launched in 2021, Live Tiles were gone.\n\nContainment attempt number two, even more extreme than Vista's sidebar. Widgets must live alongside your work, not in a separate universe.\n\nBefore the current Widget Board, Microsoft tried two half-measures.\n\nCortana Cards (2015–2020) were the most capable widgets Microsoft ever shipped. The assistant scraped your email for flight confirmations and showed gate info. It read your calendar and estimated commute times. It tracked packages automatically. It surfaced sports scores for teams you followed, restaurant suggestions based on your location, and weather forecasts tuned to your daily routine. Users managed these through a settings panel called the \"Notebook,\" where they explicitly declared their interests.\n\nAll of this required deep access to your email, location, and calendar data. Users saw a company reading their emails. Most disabled Cortana entirely.\n\nThe catch: disabling Cortana left the dashboard empty - a blank panel with nothing to show. In May 2020, Microsoft pivoted Cortana to a productivity chatbot and removed the cards.\n\nNews and Interests (April 2021) took a simpler approach - a weather icon on the Windows 10 taskbar that expanded into a news flyout on hover. The hover trigger was the problem. Users moving their mouse toward the system tray accidentally opened a panel of headlines. IT administrators scrambled to disable it via Group Policy. The feature was labeled bloatware within weeks of launch.\n\n▶ News and Interests - the accidental hover trigger that got it labeled bloatware within weeks.\n\nBoth attempts proved a consistent pattern: users want glanceable information but reject anything that feels invasive or disruptive. These two failures directly shaped what came next.\n\nWindows 11 shipped in October 2021 with a dedicated Widgets Board - a panel that slides out from the left edge of the screen when you press Win + W or click the weather icon on the taskbar. The board is an overlay, not a docked sidebar, so it claims zero permanent screen space.\n\nThe Widget Board rendered everything through Edge WebView2, the Chromium-based web control shipped as part of the Windows Web Experience Pack. Widget providers implemented the IWidgetProvider COM interface and defined their UI using Adaptive Cards - a JSON format that describes layout declaratively. No executable code, no scripts. The host parses data, never runs it. This eliminated the entire class of remote code execution attacks that killed Desktop Gadgets in 2012. But the rendering was still web-based. Users could see msedgewebview2.exe processes in Task Manager when the board opened, often consuming hundreds of megabytes of RAM.\n\nMicrosoft opened the board to third-party developers in 2023. Spotify added playback controls. Facebook Messenger shows recent conversations. Phone Link surfaces mobile notifications. Xbox Game Pass highlights new releases. Unlike Live Tiles, these widgets are interactive - you can pause a track, check a box, or reply to a message without leaving the board. For web developers, the PWA widget path is the most accessible entry point. Define widgets in your web app manifest, and they appear natively on the board. No Win32 code, no UWP packaging - your existing web stack works. That low barrier to entry is a deliberate correction from the Live Tiles era, where standing up a WNS backend cost more effort than most developers were willing to spend.\n\nThe architecture was secure - sandboxed web content can't touch your file system. But the WebView2 rendering layer, the forced MSN news feed, and the lack of user control over the board's content drew persistent criticism. Something had to change.\n\nIn mid-2024, Microsoft began rebuilding the board. The forcing function was the EU's Digital Markets Act, which required Microsoft to open the Widget Board to third-party feed providers in the European Economic Area. To comply, Microsoft separated the MSN content pipeline into a replaceable Store-updatable component - the Microsoft Start Experiences app - making it one feed provider among many rather than a hardwired default. The compliance overhaul gave Microsoft the opportunity to rebuild the rendering layer too: widget rendering moved from WebView2 to native WinUI 3.\n\nAdaptive Card JSON now maps directly to WinUI 3 XAML controls: a TextBlock in your card becomes an actual Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.TextBlock on screen. Widgets inherit Fluent Design theming, high-contrast modes, and accessibility automatically. The memory footprint dropped - a native WinUI 3 control is far lighter than a DOM element inside a Chromium instance.\n\nThe latest evolution arrived in early 2026: Lock Screen widgets. Weather, sports scores, and traffic now appear before you log in. Third-party apps can participate too. It's a full conceptual circle back to the \"glance and go\" vision that started this story in 1997 - except now the hardware can handle it, the sandbox keeps it safe, and the user stays in control. Microsoft appears to have realized that widgets shouldn't compete with applications for desktop space. They belong in the liminal moments of computing - the glance before you unlock, the pause between tasks.\n\nWith 250+ million monthly active Windows users, the potential reach for widget developers is enormous. Whether the platform delivers depends on how Microsoft navigates the tensions that killed every previous attempt.\n\nThe current Widget Board is the scar tissue made manifest. Declarative JSON with no executable code (security). Native WinUI 3 rendering, migrated off the original WebView2 pipeline (performance). An overlay, not a dock (screen space). Interactive widgets (engagement). Opt-in data access (privacy). Every lesson encoded in architecture.\n\nBut it's not perfect. The developer API has constraints that limit what you can build. The discoverability problem - most Windows users have never pressed Win + W - remains unsolved. And while the news feed is finally optional, the tension between Microsoft's desire to monetize the Discover surface and users' desire for a clean utility board is far from resolved.\n\nThose constraints, and how to work within them to ship something useful, are what the rest of this series will cover.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at President Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.\n\nA three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they \"express no view” on how he should rule.\n\nTrump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday's arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump's lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court.\n\nHellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case.\n\nThe first was after Trump’s March 2023 indictment; the second followed Trump’s May 2024 conviction and a subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that presidents and former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts.\n\nIn the later ruling, at issue in the 2nd Circuit decision, Hellerstein said Trump’s lawyers had failed to meet the high burden of proof for changing jurisdiction and that Trump’s conviction for falsifying business records involved his personal life, not official actions that the Supreme Court ruled are immune from prosecution.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit panel said Hellerstein’s ruling, which echoed his previous denial, “did not consider whether certain evidence admitted during the state court trial relates to immunized official acts or, if so, whether evidentiary immunity transformed” the hush money case into one that relates to official acts.\n\nThe three judges said Hellerstein should closely review evidence that Trump claims relate to official acts.\n\nIf Hellerstein finds the prosecution relied on evidence of official acts, the judges said, he should weigh whether Trump can argue those actions were taken as part of his White House duties, whether Trump “diligently sought” to have the case moved to federal court and whether the case can even be moved to federal court now that Trump has been convicted and sentenced in state court.\n\nTrump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, whose allegations of an affair with Trump threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. He was sentenced to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment.\n\nTrump denies Daniels’ claim and said he did nothing wrong. He has asked a state appellate court to overturn the conviction.",

    "description": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new Defense Minister to make it a priority.",
    "fullText": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new defense minister to make it a priority.\n\nIn December alone, more than 35,000 Russian soldiers were killed or seriously wounded, Ukraine’s leader says, and the aim should be to raise the number even higher – to 50,000 per month.\n\n“Make the cost of war for Russia one it cannot sustain, thereby forcing peace through strength” – this was the task set him by the president, Mykhailo Fedorov told reporters in his first briefing as Defense Minister.\n\nThe suggestion that Russia is suffering heavy losses is not new. A new report last week estimated that 1.2 million Russians have either been killed, wounded or are missing since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago – the highest casualty figure suffered by a major military power since World War II. The report put the number of Ukrainian casualties between 500,000 and 600,000.\n\n“The data suggests Russia is hardly winning,” the report’s authors wrote.\n\nMaybe not, but as senior officials from Ukraine, Russia and the United States prepare for the next round of direct talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, it would be a mistake for Ukraine’s supporters to get carried away.\n\n“Highlighting the huge numbers of Russian fatalities is an indicator that Ukraine’s main strategy is attrition. But we need more than that if we are going to move the war dynamics in a better direction,” a former Ukrainian official told CNN.\n\nOn the one hand, focusing on headline-grabbing numbers offers important perspective on Ukraine’s refusal to give up Donetsk as part of any “peace” deal with Russia.\n\nThe logic behind Kyiv’s position is simple: Very few Ukrainians believe Putin has any goal other than the total subjugation of their country. So, why hand over territory for nothing if Ukraine can expect to kill hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers while Moscow keeps trying to capture Donetsk by force?\n\nUkrainian soldiers still hold about 20% of the eastern region, which includes heavily fortified cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and latest estimates by the Institute for the Study of War suggest it could be another 18 months before Russia captures it all.\n\nIf those Russian soldiers are not killed fighting – the logic continues – they will remain in occupied Ukrainian territory ready to restart the war, from a more advantageous position, just as soon as the Kremlin has contrived a pretext to do so.\n\nVery few in Ukraine believe Putin will drop his territorial demands, and most have lost faith that US President Donald Trump will apply necessary pressure to make him change his mind.\n\n“Despite the government negotiating in good faith, many think the whole process is done to ensure US government support,” the former Ukrainian official said.\n\n“People are exceedingly skeptical about the negotiating process.”\n\nBut if there is no confidence that negotiations are headed anywhere, what about Ukraine’s battlefield strategy? Is piling up the other side’s body bags the best way forward?\n\nAn American former fighter, Ryan O’Leary, who led an international volunteer unit called Chosen Company, believes not, triggering a vigorous debate after he laid out his arguments in a social media post.\n\nHe took issue with the much vaunted “e-points” scheme, whereby Ukraine’s units earn points for each Russian soldier killed or piece of materiel destroyed. The points are exchanged for new equipment, and the Defense Ministry says the scheme provides a wealth of data that helps shape future plans.\n\nBut O’Leary suggested they create the wrong incentives, causing Ukrainian commanders to prioritize more straightforward drone strikes against infantry targets around the line of combat, rather than tougher but more significant deep strikes against Russian logistics - like vehicles and communication hubs, as well as Russian drone crews operating from rear positions.\n\n“Drone warfare is not about who hits more soldiers today … Operational depth is where wars are decided. If the enemy can move fuel, ammo, drones, crews, and repair vehicles 10 to 40 km behind the line without fear, they own depth even if they lose 5x the men in trenches,” O’Leary wrote on X.\n\nIn truth, his accusation lays bare Ukraine’s two key structural challenges.\n\nFirstly, in drone technology, operating tactics and countermeasures, Russia has caught up and is quite possibly ahead.\n\nWriting on Facebook, Oleksandr Karpyuk, an aerial reconnaissance officer in the 59th Separate Assault Brigade, complained that Ukraine had failed to capitalize on its early advantage in this space, particularly by not diversifying the number of radio frequencies used by its drones to transmit signals.\n\nConsequently, once Russia improved its electronic warfare (EW) technologies, it needed to jam just two frequencies to put a significant dent in Ukraine’s ability to fly drones behind Russian lines.\n\nIn addition, Karpyuk writes, Russia’s tactical air defense crews are much improved, and Moscow continues to benefit from taking a lead in developing fiber-optic drones, which are impervious to Ukraine’s own EW countermeasures, because they do not transmit signals.\n\nAnd then there is Ukraine’s manpower issue.\n\nThe infantry shortage is well known. Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute estimates there are fewer than ten Ukrainian infantry soldiers per kilometer of front line. He also estimates that most brigades have at most 10% of their total personnel in the infantry. Traditionally, that number would be upwards of 30%.\n\nLee told KI Insights, a strategic intelligence unit powered by the Kyiv Independent, that even those low numbers have been enough to prevent a major breakthrough by Russian forces, which have succeeded only in making small, incremental advances.\n\nBut in a war where drones - not infantry - matter most, it is Ukraine’s shortfalls in drone crews that are most pressing, especially in the key battle for operational depth – the destruction of targets up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) behind the line of combat.\n\nIn a forthright defense of the fighters under his command, the head of Ukraine’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Forces, Robert Brovdi, said last week there needed to be a threefold increase in the number of drone operators. Just 30% of the frontline – which stretches 745 miles – is currently covered, he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nFedorov, the new defense minister, acknowledges the scale of the problem, telling the Ukrainian parliament some 2 million people are ignoring their call-up papers, while 200,000 others have deserted.\n\nMuch now rests on his ability to address the manpower issue and to regain Ukraine’s technical edge, all the while ensuring he is hitting Zelensky’s targets.\n\n“Unless we constantly stay ahead of Russians in technology and battle tactics, I cannot say the chance we will prevail is high,” cautioned the former Ukrainian official.\n\nCNN’s Victoria Butenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina in Kyiv contributed to this report.",

That meant that those locations could not order supplies from the parent corporation and would have to shut down.\n\nAnd now the parent company of the Cream ice cream shop chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize and restructure its debts, which includes an employment law lawsuit judgment.\n\nCreamy Treats Inc. filed its petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California on Feb. 2, listing $500,000 to $1 million in assets and $100,000 to $500,000 in liabilities.\n\nThe San Francisco-based ice cream shop chain, which specializes in fresh ice cream sandwiches, did not list a specific reason for filing for bankruptcy protection, but among its largest unsecured creditors was Halil Budan, who is owed $98,000 for an employment law lawsuit. The debtor also listed Square Financial Services, owed $27,000.\n\n73-year-old family diner franchisee files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nMore troubled regional airlines file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nMajor department store brand liquidates in Chapter 11 bankruptcy",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Historians and observers accused the Trump administration of trying to rewrite American history to justify its own foreign policy decisions toward Latin America by posting a “historically inaccurate” version of the Mexican-American war.\n\nThe Monday statement from the White House commemorating the anniversary of the war described the conflict as a “legendary victory that secured the American Southwest, reasserted American sovereignty, and expanded the promise of American independence across our majestic continent.” The statement drew parallels between the period in U.S. history and its own increasingly aggressive policies toward Latin America, which it said would “ensure the Hemisphere remains safe.”\n\n“Guided by our victory on the fields of Mexico 178 years ago, I have spared no effort in defending our southern border against invasion, upholding the rule of law, and protecting our homeland from forces of evil, violence, and destruction,” the statement said, though it was unsigned.\n\nIn the post, the White House makes no mention of the key role slavery played in the war and glorifies the wider “Manifest Destiny” period, which resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Native Americans from their land.\n\nAlexander Aviña, Latin American history professor at Arizona State University, said the White House statement “underplays the massive amounts of violence that it took to expand” the U.S. to the Pacific shore at a time when the Trump administration has stuck its hand in Latin American affairs in a way not seen in decades, deposing Venezuela's president, meddling in elections and threatening military action in Mexico and other countries.\n\n“U.S. political leaders since then have seen this as an ugly aspect of U.S. history, this is a pretty clear instance of U.S. imperialism against its southern neighbor,” Aviña said. “The Trump administration is actually embracing this as a positive in U.S. history and framing it – inaccurately historically – as some sort of defensive measure to prevent the Mexico from invading them.”\n\nOn Tuesday, criticisms of the White House statement quickly rippled across social media.\n\nAsked about the statement in her morning news briefing, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum guffawed, quipping and noting “we have to defend sovereignty.” Sheinbaum, who has walked a tight rope with the Trump administration, has responded to Trump with a balanced tone and occasionally with sarcasm, like when Trump changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nThe Mexican-American war (1846–1848) was triggered by long-running border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico and the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845. For years leading up to the war, Americans had gradually moved into the then-Mexican territory. Mexico had banned slavery and U.S. abolitionists feared the U.S. land grab was in part an attempt to add slave states.\n\nAfter fighting broke out and successive U.S. victories, Mexico ceded more than 525,000 square miles of territory — including what now comprises Arizona, California, western Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah — to the U.S.\n\nThe moment turned Texas into a key chess piece during the U.S. Civil War and led former President Ulysses S. Grant to write later that the conflict with Mexico was “one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was formed when five New York City newspapers funded a pony express route through Alabama to bring news of the Mexican War — as it is sometimes known in the U.S. — north faster than the U.S. Post Office could deliver it.\n\nThe war continues to be a historical sticking point between the two countries, particularly as Sheinbaum repeatedly reminds Trump that her country is a sovereign nation whenever Trump openly weighs taking military action against Mexican cartels and pressures Mexico to bend to its will.\n\nThe White House statement falls in line with wider actions taken by the Trump administration to mold the federal government's language around its own creed, said Albert Camarillo, history professor at Stanford University, who described the statement as a “distorted, ahistorical, imperialist version\" of the war.\n\nAviña said the statement serves \"to assert rhetorically that the U.S. is justified in establishing its so-called ‘America First’ policy throughout the Americas,” regardless of the historical accuracy.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered the rewriting of history on display at the Smithsonian Institution, saying it was “restoring truth and sanity to American history.”\n\nThe administration has scrubbed government websites of history, legal records and data it finds disagreeable. Trump also ordered the government to remove any signs that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living,\" including those making reference to slavery, destruction of Native American cultures and climate change.\n\n“This statement is consistent with so many others that attempt to whitewash and reframe U.S. history and erase generations of historical scholarship,” Camarillo said.",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Tuesday the country should make “any sacrifice necessary” to preserve the independence of the country in the face of threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nHarper, a Conservative prime minister for nearly a decade from 2006 to 2015, made the remarks in a speech during his official portrait unveiling.\n\nHarper described the times as perilous and thanked current Prime Minister Mark Carney for attending the unveiling “at a time when challenges are unprecedented during our lives.”\n\nTrump has talked about making Canada the 51st state and has threatened the country with tariffs.\n\nThe Republican president’s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance, alarming Canada, which shares a 3,000-kilometer (1,864 mile) maritime border with Greenland in the Arctic.\n\nHarper didn’t mention Trump by name but urged Canada’s two major parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, to unify in the face of threats to the country’s sovereignty.\n\n“We must make any sacrifice necessary to preserve the independence and the unity of this blessed land,” Harper said.\n\nHarper said he hopes his portrait is only one of the many portraits of prime ministers of both parties that will continue to be exhibited for decades and centuries to come.\n\n“But that will require that in these perilous times that both parties, whatever their other differences, come together against external forces that threaten our independence,” he said.\n\nHarper also warned against “domestic policies that threaten our unity.” A separatist moment in Alberta could garner enough votes this spring to trigger a referendum for independence from Canada.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has said separatist support is about at 30%. Smith is pressuring the federal government and the British Columbia provincial government on the Pacific coast to approve a new oil pipeline to the Pacific.\n\nHarper approved of Carney’s resume when Carney applied to be the head of Canada’s central bank during Harper's time as prime minister. He joked the then-young man “has apparently gone on to enjoy some success.”\n\nCarney later became the head of the Bank of England in 2013 and prime minister of Canada last year.\n\nCarney thanked Harper for denouncing those who are threatening Canada’s sovereignty as Canada was confronted with unprecedented attacks and trade pressures.\n\n“He called on us to build a stronger Canada less dependent on the U.S.,” Carney said. “He also took the time to advise me which I have greatly appreciated.”\n\nCarney also commended Harper for his economic stewardship during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n“He came to Ottawa as a balanced-budget conservative. He believed rightly that governments should live within their means. Yet when the financial crisis struck, he did not let ideology prevent him from doing what was necessary, running deficits for five years to support the Canadian economy through the worst global downturn in generations.,” Carney said.\n\n“Mr. Harper understood that you build up strength in good times to have the capacity to act in bad times.”",

    "fullText": "Caleb Chabolla, 9, attempted a viral social media trend of microwaving a NeeDoh Nice Cube, his mother said\n\nAfter he opened the microwave, the gel-based toy exploded on his face\n\nHe suffered second-degree burns on one side and on his hands\n\nA 9-year-old boy suffered severe injuries after participating in a recent social media trend.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 20, Caleb Chabolla was preparing to leave for school when he attempted to microwave Schylling’s NeeDoh Nice Cube to make the gel-based toy more pliable, Loyola Medicine said in a news release shared with PEOPLE.\n\nCaleb's mother, Whitney Grubb, said that her son got the idea to try the trend after a conversation with a friend, who told him about the social media trend. She was in the garage to warm up her car when she heard the microwave start, and thought Caleb was warming up his breakfast.\n\n\"After hearing what she described as a blood-curdling scream, she knew something was wrong,\" the medical center said, confirming that Caleb had attempted to microwave the popular sensory toy. However, when he opened the microwave, the object, \"filled with gelatinous material, exploded on his face and hands.\"\n\nGrubb tried to rinse off the substance in the shower; however, it didn't work. She took him to the emergency room, and he was later transferred to Loyola Medicine’s Burn Center.  He also saw an ophthalmologist to treat his eye, which was swollen shut.\n\nHis vision was not impacted and Caleb is now recovering at home, Loyola Medicine said.\n\nThe Nice Cube is a “sensory squish is perfect for stretching, smushing, squeezing, and soothing,” according to the official website. “Do NOT heat, freeze, or microwave, may cause personal injury,” the site warning states.\n\nHe suffered second-degree burns on one side and on his hands, his mother told CBS News. He is expected to return to school later this week.\n\nPaula Petersen, APN, a burn center advanced practice nurse, remarked in Loyola's news release how Caleb is \"very lucky he didn’t sustain greater injuries.\" She added, \"These trends can be extremely dangerous for young people who are less likely to consider or unable to understand the serious consequences.”\n\nMcElligott said the young boy is the fourth child who has come into the facility because of the trend. \"A child who heated it up in the microwave, then put her finger on it and her finger went through, and it burned her finger,\" McElligott said, according to CBS News.\n\nShe told WGN9 that 30% of their patients are pediatric patients. “I think it’s every day common things in the home that are burning these kids and we want to make sure that parents should be diligent about what’s in their house,” she said, citing the aforementioned toys as well as “ramen noodles coming out of the microwave that kids spill on themselves, or little kids pulling hot coffee off the counter.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPEOPLE reached out to Schylling for comment.",

    "description": "The World Health Organization found that nearly 40% of cancer cases worldwide are linked to preventable causes.",
    "fullText": "A new report from the World Health Organization found that nearly 7 million cases of cancer worldwide were preventable.\n\nAnalyzing 18.7 million new cancer cases in 2022 (the most recent data available to them), researchers found that nearly 4 out of 10 cases were linked to 30 modifiable risk factors, including smoking tobacco, infections like HPV and hepatitis B, and consuming alcohol. Stomach, lung, and cervical cancer accounted for almost half of all preventable cancers in the report.\n\nThe findings are a comprehensive assessment of cancer cases globally, which vary greatly by region, so while promising, they come with limitations. \n\nThe news comes less than two weeks after it was revealed that colon cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50.\n\nCancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including family history, genetic mutations, and environmental pollutants — all things out of our control — but some risk can be mitigated with lifestyle modifications.\n\nResearch shows that diets involving lots of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are linked to higher cancer risk. They can increase inflammation and disrupt the gut microbiome, increasing the risk of colon and ovarian cancer.\n\nA diet rich in whole foods is the best way to go. Dr. Daniel Landau, an oncologist specializing in genitourinary cancers, previously told Business Insider that he mostly follows the Mediterranean diet, focusing on lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes while limiting red meat (which might be carcinogenic), dairy, alcohol, sugar, and UPFs.\n\nGut-healthy foods are also important. Dr. Susan Bullman, an associate professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center who specializes in gut health and cancer research, previously told Business Insider that she eats fiber-rich foods like pears and probiotics like kefir to feed beneficial gut microbes. Eating a wide variety of plants, such as swapping out vegetable sides or sprinkling seeds on top of salads, can also improve gut health.\n\nExercise has long been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. One 2025 trial found that a strict workout regimen for preventing colon cancer resurgence than expensive treatments like chemotherapy. While scientists are still exploring the reasons why exercise is so effective at cancer prevention, they have their theories. Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone, previously told Business Insider that exercise is probably reducing inflammation, which may help slow tumor growth.\n\nDr. Sue Hwang, an oncologist who was diagnosed with breast cancer, said you should aim for 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether it's strength training or cardio.\n\nIf you can't make it to a gym every day, she said, even taking a walk or playing with your kids in a playground helps. Even vigorous daily movements, like climbing up stairs or carrying heavy groceries, can cut down cancer risk. Still, the best thing you can do is pencil in real workouts.\n\nBeing aware of early cancer symptoms, like blood in your stool for colon cancer, can help you seek screenings earlier than the recommended starting age.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of your family history, any genetic mutations like Lynch syndrome that increase risks of several cancers, or other factors like PCOS for endometrial cancer.\n\nDr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN who helped Olivia Munn get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, said collecting data on your body, such as previous biopsies or breast density, can help you better assess your risk.",

    "description": "Chipotle plans to raise prices this year, but executives said on Tuesday that their core consumer, who makes over $100k, probably won't mind.",
    "fullText": "Chipotle Mexican Grill plans to raise menu prices by 1-2% this year — and leadership is betting that its core consumer segment, digital natives who earn over $100k, won't mind.\n\nSpeaking during Tuesday's fourth-quarter earnings call, interim CEO Scott Boatwright said Chipotle is focusing on boosting foot traffic and revenue amid weak comparable sales. To do that, they're targeting their core customer, who sits firmly at the top end of the K-shaped economy.\n\nChipotle recently conducted a \"deep dive\" of consumer research to identify the demographics and desires of its core audience and refine its strategy accordingly, Boatwright said.\n\n\"What we've learned is the guest skews younger, a little higher income, is typically a digital native, and that their grounded purpose aligns with our North Star as a brand, around clean food, clean ingredients, high protein,\" Boatwright said. \"We are the way they want to eat, and we're going to lean into that in the most meaningful way.\"\n\n\"After looking at the data last week, we learned that 60% of our core users are over $100,000 a year in average household income,\" he added. \"That gives us confidence that we can lean into that group in a more meaningful way, whether it's the solo occasion and/or group occasions to really drive meaningful transaction performance in the year.\"\n\nChipotle beat revenue estimates in 2025, its earnings report released on Tuesday showed, despite comparable restaurant sales decreasing 1.7%. The company projected its comparable sales in 2026 would be \"about flat,\" accounting for the openings of between 350 and 370 new restaurants.\n\nIn 2026, Chipotle's margins will remain \"under pressure,\" Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer said during the call, so consumers can expect pricing to increase 1-2% to narrow the gap between rising expenses and menu prices.\n\nThe broader restaurant segment is struggling with slumping sales as the K-shaped economy has upended the typical playbook for value deals and marketing campaigns. Lower-income consumers have been cutting back on spending, especially dining out, as they face rising costs across the board, while higher-income households show no signs of slowing their spending.\n\nTo draw in traffic, Chipotle recently launched its new protein snack menu, allowing customers to purchase a single taco or a side of meat (either chicken or steak) in a cup. It has also sped up the cadence of its limited-time offer releases, such as the recent promotions for chicken al pastor and red chimichurri sauce.\n\nThose promotions seem to be working, and are proof that Chipotle's core customer isn't particularly price-sensitive, Boatwright said during Tuesday's call.\n\nPrior to the protein snack menu debut, Boatwright said leadership considered whether the launch would result in a \"consumer trade-down\" effect, a common phenomenon in which price-sensitive consumers opt for a discount deal or a lower-cost menu item than they'd usually order to find better value — but \"frankly, we just didn't see it.\"\n\nInstead of becoming a cheaper alternative to their usual favorite, customers are frequently purchasing the protein side as an add-on to their typical order, which Boatwright said \"gives us confidence that the core consumer is not necessarily looking for a smaller, lower price-pointed component to the menu.\"\n\nBoatwright added that Chipotle will continue to test ideas to keep consumers coming back, including more limited-time offers and drink innovations. He also teased a \"Happier Hour\" deal specifically to re-engage younger and lower-income customers, but he added, \"I don't know if it'll be a meaningful unlock for Chipotle.\"\n\nChipotle's stock sank by more than 6% in after-hours trading.",

Say hi to Snow White.\"\n\nEpstein responded: \"[W]hat character would you like next?\" When Staley said \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Epstein replied: \"Well one side is available.\"\n\nAlso in July 2010, an unknown person emailed Epstein with the cryptic comment: \"the snow white was f..ed twice as soon as she put her costume))\".\n\nIt's not known if there is any connection between the various references to Snow White.\n\nThe Staley email exchange was initially released after the government of the Virgin Islands sued JPMorgan Chase, alleging it facilitated Epstein's sex-trafficking activities in the Caribbean, where he owned two islands.\n\nThe VI lawyers claimed in court papers that the Disney princess references were code for young women. Staley, who was a private banker at JPMorgan before he went to Barclays, testified in a different case that he did not remember the emails.\n\nEpstein — who had dealings with the rich, famous, and powerful even after he pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008 — killed himself in a Manhattan prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sweeping sex-trafficking charges.\n\nScrutiny of Staley's ties to Epstein led to his departure from Barclays in 2021. Two years later, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority banned him from management positions in financial services.\n\nStaley appealed, which resulted in him taking the stand, where he testified that his relationship with Epstein was largely professional. He also testified that he had sex with one of Epstein's staff members at the apartment of Epstein's brother. The ban was upheld.\n\nLawyers for Staley didn't immediately return a request for comment.",

The role caught attention last month thanks to its eye-catching pay package amid OpenAI's rising AI safety concerns.\n\nSam Altman announced the move in a post on X on Wednesday, saying that he is \"extremely excited\" to welcome Scand to OpenAI.\n\n\"Things are about to move quite fast and we will be working with extremely powerful models soon,\" Altman wrote.\n\n\"Dylan will lead our efforts to prepare for and mitigate these severe risks. He is by far the best candidate I have met, anywhere, for this role,\" he added.\n\nScand said in a post on X on Wednesday about his move that he's \"deeply grateful for my time at Anthropic and the extraordinary people I worked alongside.\"\n\n\"AI is advancing rapidly. The potential benefits are great — and so are the risks of extreme and even irrecoverable harm,\" he added.\n\nLast month, Altman described the job as \"stressful.\"\n\n\"You'll jump into the deep end almost immediately,\" he wrote on X.\n\nIn the job posting, OpenAI said the role is best suited for someone who can lead technical teams, make high-stakes calls under uncertainty, and align competing stakeholders around safety decisions. The company also said candidates should have deep expertise in machine learning, AI safety, and related risk areas.\n\nTensions have arisen over OpenAI's approach to safety. Several early employees — including a former head of its safety team — have left the company in recent years.\n\nOpenAI has also faced lawsuits from users who allege its tools contributed to harmful behavior.\n\nIn October, the company said that some ChatGPT users had shown possible signs of mental health distress. An estimated 560,000 users a week show \"possible signs of mental health emergencies,\" it said.\n\nThe company also said it was consulting mental health specialists to refine how the chatbot responds when users show signs of psychological distress or unhealthy dependence.",

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me.\n\nBetween 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give.\n\nIt wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard.\n\nBut as my family grew, I started questioning the path I was on. I'd never been deployed, but I knew it was likely. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon.\n\nIt went well for a while, but I was rarely seeing my family, and it wasn't the life I'd envisioned. I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids.\n\nSo, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. My wife, Holly, supported my decision, knowing that I was completely drained and losing my sense of purpose.\n\nWe also decided it was time to move back to Washington, where we both grew up.\n\nSkagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner.\n\nIt's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years.\n\nI took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity.\n\nSkagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore.\n\nI came up with an idea and went for it. I decided to buy a tulip farm and reimagine what it could be — not just a working farm, but a place people wanted to hang out.\n\nIn 2018, I bought my first farm. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems.\n\nThe questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? And how should we design the layout of the fields for tourists?\n\nTo prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He and his wife told me they had turned down 16 other buyers before choosing me. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm.\n\nMy former business partner and I bought the 30-acre property for $1.6 million, including both the land and the business.\n\nIn those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening.\n\nWe pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that.\n\nI've learned that I tend to learn things the hard way. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: \"Maybe I like doing it the hard way.\"\n\nThe fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees.\n\nToday, my 23-year-old son can operate a forklift, which he learned when he was 15. My sister runs business management and communications.\n\nI still work from 5 a.m. until bedtime, but now I'm home. I'm serving my community.\n\nI'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. My family is happy to know we can take three weeks off in the summer because of how hard we work the rest of the year.\n\nThey've seen the strain, the kitchen-table meetings, the risk of starting from scratch. I want them to see that.\n\nHealing in the soil — for us, and for guests\n\nToday, the farm is flourishing. Visitor numbers have doubled year over year for the past three years. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share.\n\nIn a world where we are gagging for meaningful in-person experiences, people are drawn to farms. I get it. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.\n\nBeing able to shape your own environment and build your own future is essential.",

    "fullText": "Gold bounced above $5,000 an ounce on Tuesday as investors rushed back into the metal following one of the sharpest selloffs in decades.\n\nSpot gold was trading around $5,072 per troy ounce at 11:10 p.m. ET on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session, when prices jumped more than 6%.\n\n\"The recovery in metals coincided with a broader improvement across financial markets,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, adding that the rebound also came as the US dollar gave back some of its earlier gains from the initial phase of the sell-off.\n\nThe reversal came after a brutal collapse in gold prices on Friday and Monday, following a record high above $5,500 per troy ounce on Thursday.\n\nThe selloff was magnified by President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Warsh is widely viewed as the most hawkish candidate, which drove the US dollar sharply higher and sparked aggressive profit-taking in gold.\n\nHowever, the drawdown was already underway in what had become a crowded trade, with market mechanics accelerating the move lower.\n\n\"The move was largely fueled by a wave of speculative buying from China, from retail traders to larger equity funds rotating into commodities, with fresh flows pushing prices to extreme levels before last week's abrupt reversal,\" wrote Manthey.\n\nWestern call options — contracts that give investors the right to buy gold at a set price and are often used to hedge geopolitical and global macro risks — also played a central role in amplifying the rally, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nThat demand faded after Warsh's nomination, triggering a wave of technical selling that cascaded into system-wide losses.\n\nMany analysts still see further upside for gold, arguing that the selloff reflected positioning rather than a deterioration in fundamentals. Key drivers include geopolitical risks, haven demand, and central bank buying.\n\nGoldman forecasts gold at $5,400 per ounce by this December.\n\nSilver's market dynamics are more extreme.\n\nSilver prices also advanced on Tuesday after a 36% plunge on Friday and a sharp additional drop on Monday. Prices had reached record levels above $121 per ounce on Thursday.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $87.50 per ounce at 11:09 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\n\"Silver is often nicknamed 'gold on steroids' — it tends to move much more than gold in percentage terms. Its smaller market size and exposure to both investment and industrial demand tend to amplify price moves in both directions,\" wrote Manthey.\n\nManthey added that silver prices are likely to remain volatile as the white metal is more sensitive to shifts in sentiment and positioning than gold.\n\nThat's even as medium-term industrial demand continues to underpin the silver market amid tight supplies in London, the hub of global silver trading.\n\n\"The persistent London liquidity squeeze adds an additional layer of extreme price behavior on top of the same call‑structure‑driven volatility seen in gold,\" wrote the Goldman analysts.",

    "fullText": "Known as ‘white gold’, lithium is among the most important mined elements on the planet – ideal for the rechargeable batteries used in tech products. Can Europe’s largest deposit bring prosperity to the local community?\n\nIt looks more like the past than the future. A vast chasm scooped out of a scarred landscape, this is a Cornwall the summer holidaymakers don’t see: a former china clay pit near St Austell called Trelavour. I’m standing at the edge of the pit looking down with the man who says his plans for it will help the UK’s transition to renewable energy and bring back year-round jobs and prosperity to a part of the country that badly needs both. “And if I manage to make some money in the process, fantastic,” he says. “Though that is not what it’s about.”\n\nWe’ll return to him shortly. But first to the past, when this story begins, about 275-280m years ago. “There was a continental collision at the time,” Frances Wall, professor of applied mineralogy at the Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, explained to me before my visit. This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”\n\nThat’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.\n\nIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know, possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.\n\nMost of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.\n\nJeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.\n\nCornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”\n\nAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He founded Cornish Lithium in 2016.\n\nWrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”\n\nHe explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects in Portugal and Serbia have been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists. In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?\n\nWall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”\n\nSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”\n\nI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.\n\nOn cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.\n\nWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nWhen he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”\n\nMorse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”\n\nThings have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”\n\nLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”\n\nCornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”\n\nWe have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.\n\nAbout 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.\n\nIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”\n\nIn this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.\n\nThe water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”\n\nIt sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.\n\nBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.\n\nSince they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals? I’m just hoping he doesn’t find out about Cornwall!”",

    "fullText": "The arrival of Munetaka Murakami leads to a big clubhouse change originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNot many people had the Chicago White Sox being aggressive this offseason on their bingo cards, but here we are. After years of not doing much, the club made a few splashes that excited the fanbase.\n\nThey struck deals wth pitchers Jordan Hicks, Anthony Kay, and Sean Newcomb while also signing reliever Seranthony Domnguez to potentially be the team's newest closer. They also traded away Luis Robert Jr. for Ronald Acuna Jr.'s brother, Luisangel Acuna.\n\nHowever, the biggest splash came when the team locked in Munetaka Murakami on a two-year, $34 million deal. He is expected to cover first base for the White Sox and should be a large part of their offense. But the question always remains with international players coming to the big leagues. Will the game at this level be too much?\n\nMORE: Former A's pitcher could be the 'x-factor' for the White Sox in 2026\n\nMurakami is a Japanese slugger, playing his career in the NPB up until this point. He is just one of the latest international players to make their way to the big leagues.\n\nBeing so far away from home can take its toll on some players. The White Sox understand this and are doing everything in their power to make their new slugger comfortable.\n\nSo, when Murakami requested the team install a bidet in the clubhouse, they got right on that, per Scott Merkin.\n\n\"One thing that stood out, one thing he did notice is I think we didn't have a bidet in our locker room,\" general manager Chris Getz told MLB.com. \"That's something that's new to him, and we are putting one in. So, it was like, 'Ok, that's new. We can do that.'\"\n\nAnything to make your potential star happy, right?\n\nNow, it would be real gamesmanship if Chicago only added the bidet to their locker room, and not the visiting locker room.\n\nMLB analyst puts the spotlight on Alek Manoah in the Angels rotation\n\nMLB analyst puts pressure on the Royals starting rotation to deliver\n\nReds biggest 'x-factor' sits outside the projected starting rotation\n\nMLB insider puts pressure on Cubs' Cade Horton to continue his success\n\nThe Red Sox projected starting rotation is built to dominate",

    "description": "Jarran Reed is in his second stint with the Seahawks and does not take his path to Super Bowl LX for granted.",
    "fullText": "Jarran Reed earns a living in the pit, the trenches of NFL combat, and this pleases the Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle to no end.\n\nHe is a football lifer, a 10th year veteran of interior clashes and scrums that often decide the winners and losers in a sport rooted in crunching contact. On Tuesday afternoon in San Jose, the 6-foot-3, 315-pound 33-year-old Reed beamed at what he has accomplished, and his journey to Super Bow LX on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium. You can be sure he will have a say in how it all turns out against the New England Patriots.\n\nA native of Goldsboro High School in North Carolina, Reed’s story is a familiar one in the Pacific Northwest. He has reveled at the chance to be a run-stuffer and quarterback chaser since he first slipped on shoulder pads and a helmet. He ground his way through East Mississippi Community College, shoring up his game and his academics, and he starred with the Alabama Crimson Tide on the defensive line.\n\nA second-round draft pick by Seattle in 2016, Reed spent the 2021 season with the Kansas City Chiefs and the 2022 campaign with the Green Bay Packers. He re-signed with Seattle in 2023, signing a $12.8 million deal before having it extended in March to a 3-year package for $25 million.\n\nAll told, Reed has done his share of the heavy lifting in helping propel the Seahawks to the season’s final weekend in the franchise’s 50th year. And it isn’t just warding off blockers and plugging gaps that make Reed invaluable. He is a locker room leader who offers fiery pep talks as a veteran who has seen it all. Coach Mike Macdonald often has Reed address the team after games, anointing the veteran to mentor and inspire one of the NFL’s youngest teams.\n\nReed takes none of his path for granted, not in a sport where change is part of the business. Reed has been too good to supplant, and he said he wants to play several more seasons.\n\n“Oh, not one bit (do I take this for granted),” Reed said. “Everybody’s journey is different. I’m very grateful for this, and it’s taught me a lot. Coming from Goldsboro, North Carolina to East Mississippi, then Alabama...all the roles were there to get me to this moment.”\n\nReed said the Seahawks immediately responded to Macdonald, the defensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens in 2022 and 2023 who was hired as head coach by Seattle before the 2024 season.\n\n“It started early with OTA’s, and we attack the day, attack the week,” Reed said. “Everybody needs to be tackled.”\n\nReed said he enjoys studying game film, be it the linemen he will encounter or the ball carriers the Seahawks are tasked to stop. He said that he is big on preparation, mind and body. He said that he thinks of NFL stars over the years who did not reach a Super Bowl.\n\n“Some greats never made it, never got a chance to experience this,” Reed said. “Man, I’m here, Year 10. I got a national championship in junior college, and at Alabama, and now I’m here to see if we can pull it out in the Super Bowl this week.”\n\nReed has always been country strong and became stronger through strength and conditioning. He said that as long as he can overpower the guy in front of him, he will continue to play.\n\n“I made a joke the other day in the weight room,” Reed said. “Now I got that grown-man strong, that dance strength.”\n\nReed said Seattle’s defense is united. That included arriving to the Super Bowl’s Opening Night media session as a unit in the same ride.\n\n“One thing I said (Monday) is that Bus 3 is the defensive bus, like, nobody gets on Bus 3 but the defense. We’re just like brothers out there. We trust each other on the field. We know where each player is going to be on the field. We play off of each other, and that connection started outside the locker room.”\n\nReed added, “We hang together a lot, a real close-knit group.”\n\nHow does a man last this long in the pit? Money is a great motivator, to be certain, and so is the zest to compete.\n\n“Just the love of the game,” Reed said. “And definitely everybody’s playing to get to the Super Bowl. Man, I love the game. It’s done a lot for me. I’ve been playing since I was a kid, five years old, and 33 now, and I’ve got a lot of football left.”\n\nReed said he had a sense he could make quite a living in this sport by the time he arrived at Alabama, among the college football programs that annually churn out NFL prospects.\n\n“I figured that I could really make this thing work and make this a great life, a life goal, a life-changing experience,” Reed said.\n\nBecoming a father was also a life-changing experience, Reed said. His oldest daughter, Jacey, was born shortly before he was drafted in 2016, when he would make FaceTime video calls with his infant girl who perked up at the sound of his voice.\n\nNow 10 years old, Jacey doesn’t hesitate to climb over her father at home, even if his body aches from the rigors of a game. She has a sister who also jumps aboard Mount Papa. This isn’t trench warfare, not with the girls giggling and their father rolling on his back and side in preparation for a kid ambush.\n\n“My daughters are amazing,” Reed said with a smile. “Look, I’m their jungle gym. They love crawling all over their dad. I really don’t mind. And it doesn’t stop them (if I’m sore or not).”",

    "fullText": "Arlington (Texas) Mansfield Timberview three-star wide receiver Trysten Shaw announced on Tuesday evening that he has decommitted from UCLA.\n\nShaw was pledged to the Bruins since Aug. 20 and originally stayed locked in despite the departure of head coach DeShaun Foster. He even returned to Westwood over the weekend for a junior day visit and reaffirmed his pledge. He’s now opted to re-open his process between his junior and senior seasons.\n\n“After a long thought and prayer with my family, I have decided to decommit and reopen my recruitment. Thank you UCLA for the opportunity,” Shaw wrote announcing his decision on X.\n\nShaw is the No. 678 overall prospect and No. 94 WR in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 86 player in Texas.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 165-pounder currently holds offers from the likes of Ole Miss, Arkansas, Kansas State, Syracuse, Pitt, Kentucky and a slew of others.\n\nShaw leaves new head coach Bob Chesney and the Bruins with just one commit in the 2027 class. On Monday, UCLA landed a commitment from Temecula (Calif.) Chaparral three-star WR Michael Farinas.\n\n“Honestly I love the culture that coach Chesney is bringing to the program,” Farinas told Rivals’ Greg Biggins. “Coach Chesney is a proven winner and I know he’s going to bring that to UCLA.\n\n“Everyone in the program wants to win and that’s something I want to be a part of. They’re building something special so I’m very excited to be a Bruin.”\n\nFarinas may now be the lone pledge in the UCLA class, but the Bruins’ big junior day weekend has them soaring with top recruits that were in attendance. Biggins has all the latest intel coming out of the weekend as Chesney and Co. look to usher in a new era of football in Los Angeles.",

Leonard's addition brings the total number of U.S. All-Stars to 16, the minimum required.\n\nThere was some backlash online after Leonard, who's averaging a career-high 27.6 points per game, 6.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists and a league-leading 2.06 steals in 36 games played this season.  He's also been as efficient as he's ever been, shooting 49.7%, 39.1% from three-point range and has the fourth-best free throw percentage in the league at 91.3%.\n\nThis will be Leonard's seventh career All-Star selection.\n\nPer the NBA's statement, the All-Star teams will be revealed at 4 p.m. PT Tuesday night on Peacock during the pregame show ahead of the Boston Celtics-Dallas Mavericks game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard selected for NBA All-Star Game",

When the reserve players for both conferences were announced on Sunday, the list did not include Leonard.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Leonard was added to the Western Conference’s roster, according to NBA insider Shams Charania. Leonard is the 16th U.S. All-Star, which is the minimum requirement. The initial group of 24 All-Stars had only 15 U.S. All-Stars.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard has been selected to the 2026 NBA All-Star Game. After the selection of the initial 24 All-Stars, Leonard was added to bring the total number of U.S. All-Stars to 16, the minimum required.\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 3, 2026\n\nLeonard will be a reserve player for the Western Conference alongside the following seven players:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards\n\nDenver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray\n\nOklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren\n\nHouston Rockets forward Kevin Durant\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Devin Booker\n\nPortland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija\n\nThe West Conference starters will be Los Angeles Lakers forward-guard Luka Doncic, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, San Antonio Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokić and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry.\n\nThis is Leonard’s seventh NBA All-Star selection of his career. He is the only Clippers player to have earned an All-Star selection this season.\n\nThe Western Conference is filled with superstars, but Leonard has been one of the top players in the NBA since defeating the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 20. He has led the Clippers out of a 6-21 rut and now the team is 23-26.\n\nAlthough many believed Leonard should have been named an All-Star initially, the two-time NBA champion told reporters he was not expecting to earn the honor after the Clippers’ game against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.\n\n“It’s never an expectation for me. I was a guy that had to work my way into those conversations. It is what it is.

    "fullText": "Winning the Super Bowl and hoisting the Lombardi trophy as confetti rains down has always been considered the stuff of dreams. It’s one of the most coveted championships in all of sports. It’s what children emulate when they organize backyard football games, and Tom Brady is doing his best to remind both Sam Darnold and Drake Maye of that ahead of their respective debuts at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGiven the fact that he’s both won and lost more Super Bowls than most players will ever sniff throughout their careers, it’s safe to say that there’s no better person to humor before venturing into the gridiron’s grandest game than the former New England Patriot. Although it’s just as important to remember that, while confidence and encouragement are key, the hardcold truth is that not everybody can be Brady.\n\n“The reality is that the best team, in a one-game series, doesn’t always win,”he noted to Colin Cowherd during his most recent interview. “In football, you really only have one chance to get it right. That’s the challenge. You could have an off day,” he added.\n\nIn highlighting the Los Angeles Rams’ botched punt against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, Brady suggested that it doesn’t take much to give your opponent “all of the momentum,” and that those moments happen incredibly fast. “That’s how finicky the game is,” he suggested.\n\nWhile it may be a bit funny to hear the most successful signal caller in NFL history refer to his former profession as being “finicky,” it’s also a testament to just how much the Super Bowl means to players. In other words, those being the ones of Brady’s former Super Bowl rival, the star tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce, “Losing a Super Bowl will never make you want to go back and win one.”\n\nIf anything, knowing that you only get one shot at cementing your name in the analogs of American sporting culture makes things that much harder. “That’s why I always think basketball, baseball, a seven-game series, does identify the best team, because you get seven chances to get it right,” Brady suggests.\n\nEven if this eventually proves to be neither Darnold nor Maye’s last Super Bowl appearance, both men are well aware that they won’t get a second opportunity at winning their championship debut. Throw in the fact that both teams feature a top-five defense from a points allowed perspective, and it’s safe to say that both of these quarterbacks know that their margin for error on Sunday will be painfully slim.\n\nThen again, that’s yet another one of the many things that make the Super Bowl the biggest game of the year, and we simply wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe post “You Could Have an Off Day”: Tom Brady Warns Sam Darnold and Drake Maye Ahead of Super Bowl 2015 Rematch appeared first on The SportsRush.",

The move signals a clear pivot as the Pistons continue shaping a roster that better fits around Cade Cunningham.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the deal shakes out like this:\n\n2026 first-round pick swap (protected) from Minnesota\n\nA large trade exception and added flexibility\n\nThis trade isn’t about upside anymore, it’s about fit.\n\nIvey’s time in Detroit never quite found stable ground. He was asked to run the offense early when Cade went down, struggled through the Monty Williams season, showed flashes before a serious leg injury, and then returned to a team that had already started to define itself without him.\n\nDetroit didn’t need a blockbuster return. They needed clarity.\n\nThe Pistons are betting that a change of scenery, and playing next to Cade Cunningham, helps Huerter rediscover his shooting stroke. He’s a career 37 percent three-point shooter, offers more size than Ivey, and fits much more cleanly into a spacing-based offense.\n\nDetroit is banking on Huerter getting better shots, not being asked to create them.\n\nŠarić is mostly salary ballast. There’s a very real chance he never plays a minute for Detroit and could be waived as the Pistons sort through roster mechanics and deadline flexibility.\n\nThis move closes the book on a frustrating chapter for both sides.\n\nIvey gets a fresh start with the Bulls.\nDetroit gets shooting, flexibility, and roster clarity.\n\nIt’s not a trade that wins headlines — but it’s one that tells you exactly who the Pistons are building around and how they want to play moving forward.\n\nAnd that matters more than nostalgia.\n\nThe post Detroit Pistons Trade Jaden Ivey, Acquire 2 Players appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "title": "The Most Interesting Things Dusty May Said",
    "description": "Dusty May didn't hold back while talking about Michigan State on Monday, and also praised Yaxel Lendeborg in a way you just don't hear very often.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Dusty May took to the podium for his scheduled Monday morning availability with the media and touched on several interesting notes. He talked about the transfer portal, his own roster construction, dirty plays at Michigan State and standout Yaxel Lendeborg. No matter what the topic, May nailed it and left everyone with plenty to talk about.\n\nMay doesn’t pretend college basketball is what it was even five or seven years ago. In fact, he embraces the change — even when it means letting go of control.\n\nFrom day one in Ann Arbor, May said the directive has been simple: win now, while still preparing players for whatever comes next. That philosophy explains Michigan’s roster construction, its approach to the transfer portal, and the way the program handles departures.\n\n“I think everyone would rather us just come in and sign a bunch of freshmen and lose and try to grow it organically,” May said. “But our job from day one was to win. And so we brought in a balanced class.”\n\nThat balance extends beyond recruiting rankings. May’s own path — from a Division II athlete to a student manager to a young coach — shapes how he views player movement today. For him, it’s about preparation, not permanence.\n\n“We want to prepare these guys for what’s next,” May said. “We want them to stay as long as they’re committed to doing it together and representing Michigan. But if they choose something different, then we’re not mad at them.”\n\nThat mindset applies even to former Wolverines now wearing different uniforms. May still watches, still cheers, and still keeps in touch.\n\n“They were for us. We were for them. We’re still in each other’s lives,” he said. “It just wasn’t our situation at that time, and we’re okay with it.”\n\nIn a Big Ten where margins are razor-thin, May understands how quickly narratives can flip. One bounce, one shot, one late-game execution can redefine an entire season. That almost happened when Michigan played Penn State in Happy Valley earlier this year. With the Nittany Lions up next on Thursday, May is not taking the matchup lightly.\n\n“If [Freddie] Dilione hits that shot against us, our season may look a little bit different,” he said. “You just keep getting to the next thing.”\n\nThat reality has been evident across the league, from Minnesota’s near-misses to Rutgers’ steady improvement. May stressed that no one is sneaking through the Big Ten anymore.\n\n“Every team in our league has really good players,” he said. “If you think you can take a night off, you’re going to be disappointed.”\n\nMay’s respect for competitiveness also showed up when asked about physical and potentially dangerous plays that took place against Michigan State in East Lansing. While he declined to escalate publicly, he made it clear he values how his team handled those moments.\n\n“I am incredibly proud of our guys for their self-control, their restraint, and their impulse control,” he said. “I’ll leave it at that.”\n\nOne of the players who had to use all of those qualities after being purposely tripped during an aggressive closeout, was Yaxel Lendeborg. He's been at the center of Michigan’s success and embodies everything May wants his program to be about. Despite limited designed touches, the forward continues to dominate within the flow.\n\n“We ran probably one or two plays for him, and he gets 26 and 12,” May said. “There aren’t a lot of guys like that.”\n\nWhat stands out most, though, isn’t the production. It’s the mentality.\n\n“He doesn’t act like a mercenary,” May said. “He acts like he’s completely embedded in our program, our culture, and winning for others.”\n\nFor May, that combination — humility, adaptability, and belief in collective success — is what gives Michigan its edge, no matter how much the sport continues to change.",

    "description": "The Pistons’ trade for Kevin Huerter earns a strong grade as Detroit adds shooting, draft value, and roster clarity at the deadline.",
    "fullText": "At first glance, trading Jaden Ivey for Kevin Huerter doesn’t exactly scream blockbuster.\n\nBut context matters, and when you zoom out, this move looks a lot smarter than it might have a year ago.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons aren’t rebuilding anymore. They’re sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference, playing winning basketball, and operating like a team that knows exactly who it is. That reality changed everything about how Detroit had to approach Ivey’s future.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the deal shakes out like this:\n\n2026 first-round pick swap (protected) from Minnesota\n\nA large trade exception and added flexibility\n\nAs talented as Ivey is, the writing had been on the wall for a while.\n\nHe was coming off a serious injury, staring down restricted free agency, and no longer a natural fit with how the Pistons’ core has gelled around Cade Cunningham. Detroit wasn’t going to re-sign him at a premium — and they also couldn’t afford to spend valuable regular-season reps letting him slowly work his way back into form.\n\nFor a team with real championship aspirations, patience has limits.\n\nSo instead of letting the situation linger or watching Ivey’s value stagnate, the Pistons made a proactive decision.\n\nHuerter isn’t being asked to save the offense or carry a scoring load. That’s important.\n\nHe slides in as a low-usage, high-IQ rotation piece, someone who can dribble, pass, and shoot without hijacking possessions. Even though his three-point percentage dipped this season, his track record suggests that number is far more of an outlier than a trend.\n\nMore importantly, he benefits from playing next to Cade, where clean looks and rhythm shots come naturally.\n\nThis isn’t about upside. It’s about fit and reliability.\n\nThe quiet victory in this deal is the 2026 first-round pick swap.\n\nAs things stand, Detroit would move up multiple spots late in the first round, a meaningful upgrade for a team that’s already built to win now. Turning a player who wasn’t in the long-term plans into both a rotation shooter and draft capital is exactly how contenders operate.\n\nIt’s efficient. It’s disciplined. And it avoids sunk-cost thinking.\n\nThis deal doesn’t solve everything.\n\nDetroit could still use another ball handler. Adding one more versatile forward would help lock in favorite status across the East. And if there’s a bigger swing to take before the deadline, the Pistons should absolutely explore it.\n\nBut as a first move, this checks a lot of boxes.\n\nThe Pistons didn’t chase flash. They chased clarity.\n\nThey moved off a player who no longer fit the timeline, added immediate help, improved their draft position, and kept their championship window intact.\n\nThat’s how good teams stay good.\n\nThe post Trade Grade: Detroit Pistons Ship Jaden Ivey to Chicago Bulls appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox have been looking for an impact bat to add to their lineup after losing Alex Bregman to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nHowever, they have failed to land one yet. They had a rumored interest in Eugenio Suárez and Brendan Donovan, but they are no longer available. They have also been linked to Isaac Paredes in trade rumors, and Houston Astros general manager Dana Brown spoke on Paredes current situation.\n\n“Right now, both of them are still part of our roster and we have plans for both of them to play. Right now, our plan is for both of them to be there,” Brown said when asked if he envisions Paredes and Christian Walker on the team when they get to camp, per The Athletic’s Chandler Rome.\n\nHe did not shut the door on Paredes being traded, but he said the team does have a plan for him and envisions him on the team. Houston may not be too eager to trade him, and may rather trade Walker to have Paredes move back to first base.\n\nIf Paredes is not available, the Red Sox’s options to upgrade are limited. They seem focused on infielders as they look for an impact bat, which makes sense given the surplus of outfielders they already have.\n\nThey could look to trade for Matt Shaw or Nico Hoerner from the Cubs, who could be willing to part with one of them now that they have Bregman.\n\nIf the Red Sox do not add an infielder, Marcelo Mayer figures to start the season at third base with a platoon of Romy Gonzalez and David Hamilton at second base. Kristian Campbell is also an option at second base, but he seemingly needs more time in Triple-A.\n\nRed Sox Reportedly Sign MiLB Reliever, Extend Invite To Major League Spring Training",

    "fullText": "NFL.com analyst Kevin Patra has a piece of advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason: re-sign or replace linebacker Devin Lloyd.\n\n\"The Jags seem unlikely to use the franchise tag on Lloyd (projected at $28.2 million, per Over The Cap),\" wrote Patra. \"If he prices himself out of Jacksonville, there will be a gaping hole in the middle of Campanile’s D that needs to be filled.\"\n\nLloyd did a bit of everything for the Jaguars' defense this past season and brought a high-impact presence. When he missed time briefly with an injury during the middle portion of the season, his absence was noticeable.\n\nLloyd finished the season totaling 25 pressures as a blitzer during the regular season, and ranked 11th among linebackers in PFF's run defense grade. In coverage, he recorded five interceptions and two pass breakups.\n\nAs Patra pointed out, the franchise tag won't be an option at that amount. As a free agent, Lloyd is going to garner interest from a number of teams. Spotrac is projecting that he earns a three-year deal worth $60.4 million.\n\nFor a Jaguars team that's a bit short on cap space currently and has other needs to address -- like the defensive line and cornerback -- does Jacksonville have the flexibility to bring Lloyd back at that amount?\n\nIf Lloyd doesn't return, there will certainly be a void to fill in the middle of the Jaguars' defense and no obvious fill-in next to Foye Oluokun.\n\nCurrent on the roster options to potentially take over for Lloyd include Ventrell Miller, Jack Kiser, Yasir Abdullah, and Jalen McLeod.\n\nAddressing this position early on in the draft could be a real possibility for Jacksonville. Anthony Campanile's defensive scheme and his coaching background at the linebacker position may have to be tasked with elevating this unit as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: What Jacksonville Jaguars must accomplish during 2026 NFL offseason",

    "description": "Arsenal 1-0 Chelsea (4-2 aggregate): Kai Havertz’s late strike secured the Gunners’ spot in the League Cup final",
    "fullText": "A long-awaited return. Not just Arsenal's first cup final in six years but – perhaps more importantly to the wider season – another comeback goal from Kai Havertz. Many at the club see him as the difference.\n\nHe made the difference in an otherwise poor match, ending any late tension as he rounded Robert Sanchez in stoppage time to secure a 1-0 victory that was a 4-2 on aggregate, to secure a place in the Carabao Cup final.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side are right to happily celebrate that, in a season that could yet break through all manner of barriers. A second trophy of the Basque’s time, and the first for this specific group of players, is now within sight. They finally have a return to Wembley.\n\nFew will celebrate this individual game, though.\n\nIt used to be said in football that nobody remembers semi-finalists and, whatever the truth of that, few will remember this semi-final. Even one late moment of suspense, which was a Cole Palmer free-kick to feasibly equalise, was delayed and had the drama taken out of it by finicky technicalities.\n\nArsenal, for their part, had done the necessary work in the first leg. Arteta might reasonably claim they should have won that game by three goals, as he pretty much told his players after that match. Liam Rosenior might instead slightly rue the fact that match came so early in his tenure.\n\nNow with a firmer grasp of the tactical shape of his Chelsea squad, his team gave the Premier League leaders a much more measured match. They still couldn’t overcome an initial 3-2 deficit, which Arsenal eventually turned into more.\n\nIf that first leg at Stamford Bridge was a much better match, this second leg was not really the advertisement for the Carabao Cup in the way the competition has enjoyed over the past decade.\n\nThere was until recently a real sense of fun bonus football about it, something that stood out all the \n\nThe fact the Champions League expansion has made the first month of the year also the busiest of the year is probably a significant factor in that.\n\nThe major clubs now just have so much football that there are inevitably going to be drop-offs. You just can’t go full gun in everything, as these two did in the first leg.\n\nThis time, so many attacks ended in such tired ways, with players blazing over. Enzo Fernandez did that at least twice.\n\nAbove anything, this entire match was a visual testament to too much football. More is now very much less. But is there also something else?\n\nThis might have been the Carabao Cup, and a knock-out, but it felt like a fairly typical Premier League game right now. It was two very tactical coaches constantly looking to outmanoeuvre each other. This felt more relevant than the actual movement of players like Eberechi Eze or Joao Pedro.\n\nIn other words, a coach-led game, fully systemised pressing football. You could see some of that in Chelsea's tepid late charge. It was like they were playing for a draw when they needed to win.\n\nHence the decisions that felt like they had the biggest effect on the first half were Rosenior initially going with a three-man defence that completely shut out Viktor Gyokeres, and then Arteta responding by bringing Gabriel Martinelli further inside.\n\nChelsea had been warned when the Brazilian broke through once in the first half, Malo Gusto getting back well to block the shot. The best that Rosenior’s side had in response was a Fernandez long-range effort that Kepa Arrizabalaga did well to thump away.\n\nOtherwise, the main moment of intrigue was Chelsea opting to place three players as far back as the halfway line for an Arsenal corner, intentionally dragging away some of the bodies that cause opposition sides such chaos in these set-pieces. Jurrien Timber still went close.\n\nWhile there has been a certain cynicism about how Rosenior can speak off the pitch, it’s been hard to criticise the action on the pitch – specifically how proactive he has been.\n\nThis is a coach who clearly enjoys solving tactical problems. That was seen away to Antonio Conte’s Napoli and in a home derby against West Ham United, where testing deficits were turned into convincing 3-2 victories.\n\nBoth came from changes of personnel and formation.\n\nRosenior here seemed intent on springing a trap on Arsenal, as Cole Palmer and Estevao were introduced in the second half to greatly change the emphasis of play. But was he just too clever? Was this a bit far, where they ended up playing for tactical security rather than the win they needed?\n\nThe gambit of Liam Delap on the right wing hadn’t worked, admittedly. He spent most of his time on the pitch running into a hard Arsenal defensive wall. Palmer still doesn’t look at his best, though, as emphasised with that late free-kick. Worse, there wasn't exactly much energy to their late push, the one time the emotion of the game rose above the temperate.\n\nArteta had responded with his own major switch, as Viktor Gyokeres was brought off for Havertz, the German receiving loud cheers as he continues to return to full fitness.\n\nThere are many at Arsenal who believe he could be the real difference-maker not just in a title run-in, but potentially even winning multiple trophies.\n\nThey just have to go and win one first. Havertz has duly put them within sight.",

    "description": "Paying homage to the long-dead Transcendentalist, some people are building full-scale replicas of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden cabin.",
    "fullText": "For this story, Dorie read “Walden” for the first time since high school.\n\nJasper and Satchel Sieniewicz can’t believe it was a one man job.\n\nAs children, their father read to them from Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” which includes lengthy descriptions of Thoreau building his cabin at the eponymous pond in Concord, Mass., using hand tools to form beams from fallen timber and upcycling wood from a fisherman’s shanty. All of it he did alone except for raising the frame with a few friends, though even this Thoreau qualifies as “rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any necessity.”\n\nAfter building a full-scale replica of Thoreau’s cabin in the woods behind their family’s vacation home in Maine, the brothers don’t buy it. Even using a saw mill and power tools, it took them three summers of labor, on and off between school and work beginning the first summer of the pandemic, plus the help of their father, Tom Sieniewicz. Thoreau was living in his cabin in under three months.\n\n“There is no way that he did it by himself in the time period that he said it was done,” said Jasper, now 23.\n\nNo registry tallies how many people have made replicas of Thoreau’s cabin, but they exist across the country, built for private use, for writers’ retreats, for academic purposes and as Airbnb rentals. Aiding the projects, The Thoreau Society started selling blueprints of the 10-by-15-foot cabin at their gift shop about seven years ago. And at the Sam Beauford Woodworking Institute in Adrian, Mich., you can (Axe craft gets a week of its own.)\n\nIn 1845, Thoreau moved into his one-room cabin in the woods and proceeded to live there for two years, two months and two days in significant (though not total) quietude, seeking, as he wrote, “to front only the essential facts of life.” He published his account of this experience, “Walden; or, Life in the Woods” in 1854.\n\nToday, it seems quaint to imagine a man so overwhelmed by 19th-century society that he’d seek such extended retreat. There was no electricity back then, no cellphones, no nudifying A.I. chatbots. But Thoreau’s prescription for a life lived more simply, one more attuned to nature, is an enticing response to this unmatched moment of political, social and technological chaos. It’s likely why his legacy has survived so long; perhaps why he’s far more popular a writer today than he ever was in his own life. (The first print run of 2,000 copies of “Walden” took more than five years to sell; it has since been translated into nearly every language spoken on Earth.)\n\nPerhaps it is also why people are building his cabin.\n\nThe Sieniewicz brothers originally hoped to build a treehouse, but the elder Mr. Sieniewicz, an architect, prohibited them from damaging or removing any living trees on the property, prompting a pivot: “I somehow convinced them that building Henry David Thoreau’s cabin was their idea,” he said.\n\nThe boys had visited the site in Concord with their father years prior, but admittedly, the interest in Transcendentalism was mostly his, especially insofar as the philosophy emphasizes individualism, self reliance and a connection to nature. Still, they were game to build the cabin with his blessing, using mostly recycled materials and milling their own wood from fallen trees they found in the forest. “Give a couple teenagers a commercial chain saw, what could happen?” Tom Sieniewicz joked. The boys picked up the new skills they needed by watching YouTube videos; the rest they’d learned as children in woodworking classes.\n\nNot everyone who builds a replica Walden cabin takes as long as the Sieniewicz family because not everyone takes as strict an environmental approach. But like them, most have made it a group effort.\n\nJim and Rachel Van Eerden had a “barn raising” for their cabin in Stokesdale, N.C., with friends building historically accurate furniture, a contractor working on the frame, and even a blacksmith forging nails in the style of the 1850s. Their “Walden” cabin is the first in a growing series of literature-inspired structures on their homestead property, rented out via Airbnb and VRBO. The listing explicitly warns would-be visitors about the lack of plumbing, electricity and Wi-Fi; showers and toilets are available at nearby “Narnia cottage,” instead.\n\nTheir cabin’s interior is nearly true to Thoreau’s model, with even the dents and nicks in the wood desk matching the writer’s own. They made a few additions to the structure though. “We gave ourselves what we called the ‘third year liberty’ where we said, ‘OK, if Thoreau would have stayed a third year, he would have wanted a little front porch. He would’ve wanted a garret,’” said Mr. Van Eerden.\n\nJeffrey Ryan had originally planned to build his cabin solo to mimic Thoreau, but he pivoted after nearly falling from an 8-foot ladder. “That’s when I said, ‘Time out, I’m calling for help,’” Mr. Ryan said. He completed the work on his cabin with the help of a childhood friend, building it in the woods behind his house in Maine. In line with Thoreau’s environmentalist ethos, he sourced used and recycled materials wherever possible — many of the wood beams were leftovers from the construction of his main house, the wood stove was a gift from a neighbor, and the antique windows were purchased on Facebook Marketplace. “I’ve stayed remarkably true to his vision,” he said. He also stayed close to Thoreau’s cost: Mr. Ryan spent $1,670 on supplies. Thoreau spent $28.12½; about $1,200 in today’s dollars.\n\nBut for others, using Thoreau’s exact methods is beside the point. Kevin Klein built his cabin in the woods behind his house in Hingham, Mass. two years ago, tapping his stepfather, a master carpenter, to help. He paid a contractor to put on the roof and spent roughly $4,500 on materials from Lowe’s. “This isn’t a strict, historical fetishization project,” he said.\n\nMr. Klein first became acquainted with Thoreau when he was in high school, watching “South Park.” In a Season 1 episode, Cartman wins a writing contest by plagiarizing “Walden” and Mr. Klein, curious and unfamiliar, bought a copy. It still lives on his bookshelf, and he’s read it multiple times.\n\nEven before “Walden,” critics questioned Thoreau’s motivations for building and moving into his isolated cabin. “I think he touches a lot of nerves,” said Laura Walls, a scholar of American Transcendentalism. “What a lazy bum this guy has to be, not pulling his weight in society and isolating himself like that,” she said, paraphrasing his detractors.\n\nBut for fans of Thoreau, that individualism is the appeal, “the whole idea of leaving society behind and rebelling against industrialization and being self-reliant with hand tools,” said Luke Barnett, whose Sam Beauford Woodworking Institute offers the Walden cabin series. Mr. Barnett was first introduced to Thoreau in fifth grade, bribed with Snickers bars as part of a reading program. “I loved it,” he said, “It’s kind of dry, let’s not lie and pretend it’s not. But the concepts in it attracted me and I reread it every few years.”\n\nAs a child, Mr. Barnett experienced periods of homelessness and came into his woodworking career after dropping out of high school. Though most of his work involves power tools, Mr. Barnett still sees the value in doing things by hand and offers his class to help empower like-minded woodworkers and outdoors people. “With just those tools, they can build anything they could ever imagine. They do not even need electricity,” he said. “Nobody can ever take that away from you. You are completely self reliant.”\n\nIn addition to championing self-reliance, Thoreau was an early environmentalist. Today’s Walden Pond is lush with trees, thanks to a state reservation program, but Thoreau witnessed immense swathes of the forest torn down by loggers. He was among the first to decry the loss, and among the first to question the rampant consumerism which drove its degradation. An Abolitionist, Thoreau avoided sugar, which was produced by slave labor, and he wore simple clothes instead of the new Paris fashions.\n\nTo be an ethical consumer of food, clothes, shelter or even entertainment today is difficult. But a few hours alone in a simple cabin can offer some perspective. Dr. Walls explained, “The whole point for Thoreau was a deliberate experiment in simplifying our wants — what we think we want — and trying to get to the heart of what it means to live a full life.”\n\nSelf reliance doesn’t mean hermitude. It didn’t for Thoreau — while living at Walden, he regularly went into Concord for supplies, visited with friends and ate meals with his family.\n\nBut, he also sometimes needed a break. While at Walden, Thoreau read and wrote, swam in the lake, and spent hours in total stillness, raptly observing nature from his doorway. “I grew in those seasons like corn in the night,” Thoreau wrote of the experience.\n\nFor Mr. Ryan, his cabin offers a peaceful space just for writing. “The simplicity invites focus,” he said. He has just a kerosene lamp, a desk modeled after Thoreau’s and bookshelves full of research material (to avoid using Google). “It naturally makes me not want to check email impulsively. I’m there to write.”\n\nMr. Klein mostly uses his cabin as a quiet place to smoke his cigars. He, his wife and their four children hike in the woods behind their home and will occasionally sleep out in the cabin, using mats and blankets from the house.\n\nThe Van Eerdens only sometimes get to read in their cabin; at about $130 a night, it’s usually booked “We have literally had guests from Germany, from New Zealand, from Paris, from London, all arriving with this excitement about stepping into a book that made a mark on them,” Mr. Van Eerden said. Sometimes the excitement exceeds experience; he’s had to explain to some guests how to start a fire in the fireplace.\n\nJasper Sieniewicz has read some Thoreau, but not as extensively as his father. “I’m sure it’s instilled in me in ways that I probably am not even really aware of,” he said. His father has furnished the cabin authentically, with hard wooden chairs and a desk; if it were up to Jasper, there’d be a couch instead, but he recognizes that his father will be enjoying more time there than he and his brother, who are busy building their careers as engineers.\n\nSatchel did spend the night there a few years back with his then girlfriend. “I honestly would be too scared to stay there alone,” he said.",

Across an extensive set of experiments on 8 datasets/tasks, we find that CNN-based pre-trained models are competitive and outperform their Transformer counterpart in certain scenarios, albeit with caveats.",

    "description": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers",
    "fullText": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers\n\nUltra-processed foods (UPFs) have \n\nUPFs and cigarettes are engineered to encourage addiction and consumption, researchers from three US universities said, pointing to the parallels in widespread health harms that link both.\n\nUPFs, which are widely available worldwide, are food products that have been industrially manufactured, often using emulsifiers or artificial colouring and flavours. The category includes soft drinks and packaged snacks such as crisps and biscuits.\n\nThere are similarities in the production processes of UPFs and cigarettes, and in manufacturers’ efforts to optimise the “doses” of products and how quickly they act on reward pathways in the body, according to the paper from researchers at Harvard, the University of Michigan and Duke University.\n\nThey draw on data from the fields of addiction science, nutrition and public health history to make their comparisons, published on 3 February in the healthcare journal the Milbank Quarterly.\n\nThe authors suggest that marketing claims on the products, such as being “low fat” or “sugar free”, are “health washing” that can stall regulation, akin to the advertising of cigarette filters in the 1950s as protective innovations that “in practice offered little meaningful benefit”.\n\nUltra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts.\n\nUltra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, “mechanically separated meat”, organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed.\n\nUltra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.\n\n“Many UPFs share more characteristics with cigarettes than with minimally processed fruits or vegetables and therefore warrant regulation commensurate with the significant public health risks they pose,” they concluded.\n\nOne of the authors, Prof Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan, a clinical psychologist specialising in addiction, said her patients made the same links: “They would say, ‘I feel addicted to this stuff, I crave it – I used to smoke cigarettes [and] now I have the same habit but it’s with soda and doughnuts. I know it’s killing me; I want to quit, but I can’t.’”\n\nThe debate around UPFs fits a well-worn pattern in the field of addiction, according to Gearhardt. She said: “We just blame it on the individual for a while and say ‘oh, you know, just smoke in moderation, drink in moderation’ – and eventually we get to a point where we understand the levers that the industry can pull to create products that can really hook people.”\n\nWhile food, unlike tobacco, is essential for survival, the authors argue that the distinction makes action doubly necessary because it is difficult to opt out of the modern food environment.\n\nGearhardt said it should be possible to distinguish between harmful UPFs and other foodstuffs in the same way that alcoholic drinks are differentiated from other beverages.\n\nUPFs meet “established benchmarks” as to whether a substance should be considered addictive, the paper argues, with design features that “can drive compulsive use” – although “the harms of UPFs are clear, irrespective of their addictive nature”.\n\nThe authors suggested that lessons from tobacco regulation, “including litigation, marketing restrictions and structural interventions”, could offer a guide to reducing harm related to UPFs, calling for public health efforts to “shift from individual responsibility to food industry accountability”.\n\nProf Martin Warren, chief scientific officer at the Quadram Institute, a specialist food research centre, said that while there were parallels between UPFs and tobacco, the authors risked “overreach” in their comparisons.\n\nThere were questions, he said, over whether UPFs were, like nicotine, “intrinsically addictive in a pharmacological sense, or whether they mainly exploit learned preferences, reward conditioning and convenience”.\n\nHe said it was also important to consider whether the adverse health effects attributed to UPFs came from their contents, or because they replaced “whole foods rich in fibre, micronutrients and protective phytochemicals”. He said: “This distinction matters, because it influences whether regulatory responses should mirror tobacco control or instead prioritise dietary quality, reformulation standards, and food system diversification.”\n\nDr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive of Amref Health Africa, said: “This journal article reinforces a growing public health alarm sounding across Africa [where] corporates have found a comfortable, and profitable, nexus: weak government regulation on harmful products and a changing pattern of consumption.\n\n“All this places new and preventable pressures on already stretched health systems,” he said. “Without publicly led interventions on the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, we risk health systems’ collapse.”",

Tan did not name the new hire.\n\nIntel's stock has rallied over the last year as investors gain optimism about the company's foundry business, but the company is primarily making chips for itself.\n\nOver the past few years, the embattled American chipmaker has fallen behind major semiconductor players that have seen a boost from the AI data center buildout.\n\nEarlier this month, production snags and supply troubles overshadowed the chipmaker's better-than-expected quarterly results. Investors had also been hoping for more clarity on an anchor customer for its foundry segment.\n\nLast year, the company received a wave of big investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia.\n\nTan also discussed the memory chip shortage rattling the technology sector.\n\nRising AI data center demand has created a supply and demand imbalance that's allowed memory chip companies to continue hiking prices.\n\nHe called AI the \"biggest challenge\" for memory and said he expects \"no relief until 2028.\"",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Researchers are sounding the alarm after finding antibiotic resistance genes released from melting Antarctic glaciers.\n\nA study published in the journal Biocontaminant examined the effects of glacial melting on our water supply.\n\nGlaciers serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes, or ARGs, and other microbes. When they are released from the ice, they enter our water systems, posing a major health risk to people downstream.\n\nMillions of people get their water from glacier-fed rivers and lakes. ARGs are strands of DNA that make bacteria more resistant to drugs. When ARGs in meltwater make their way into our water supply, they become a global public health risk.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of viewing glaciers, rivers, and lakes as being part of a \"glacier continuum.\" This means they are an interconnected system rather than separate environments.\n\nFrom our gas-powered cars to overconsumption, human activity has contributed to the production of heat-trapping gases that warm the planet. Rising global temperatures have caused glaciers to rapidly melt, causing elevated sea levels and releasing ARGs.\n\nARGs from melting glaciers are worrisome because they help facilitate the spread of diseases. This threat is compounded by the fact that our growing microplastic problem is also helping antibiotic-resistant bacteria breed. As a result, medicines are being rendered less effective.\n\nOne way we can combat warming temperatures is by making more eco-friendly lifestyle choices. This might include installing solar panels, which can help you slash utility rates and cut energy-related pollution.\n\nTCD's Solar Explorer curates competitive bids from vetted installers, saving you up to $10,000 on installation. EnergySage, a TCD partner, provides a free service that helps people find installers, save thousands, and understand available incentives.\n\nOngoing research into the effects of glacial melt helps us understand and approach the problem of ARGs.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Climate change is reshaping microbial risks in ways we are only beginning to understand,\" study co-author Guannan Mao of Lanzhou University told The Microbiologist.\n\n\"Recognizing glaciers as part of the global antibiotic resistance landscape is an important step toward protecting both environmental and human health.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

And I blame the United States people for this too. They’re getting what they deserve because the last election was simple. You had the choice of the Constitution or the criminal. And for some reason, they took the criminal. So they shouldn’t be surprised at what they’re getting. He’s a convicted sex offender. He don’t pay taxes. Well, you know, he’s a draft dodger. Wouldn’t serve his country, and yet he stands out there and preaches patriotism,” Jesse Ventura said.\n\nSpeaking on the SpinSisters Podcast last week, Ventura floated the idea of Minnesota seceding from the United States and joining Canada after Trump suggested that the Great White North should become a U.S. state.\n\n“I am one that thinks, let me throw this out on your show and we’ll get some headlines. How about since Trump dislikes Minnesota so bad, and we’re so out of control, let’s join Canada?” Jesse Ventura asked.\n\n“Instead of Canada becoming the 51st state of America and lose their healthcare, like they said, they would never do that because they’d lose their healthcare. I’d like to see Minnesota, all of us become Canadians, and make this part of Canada, because it’s obvious Donald Trump don’t want us.”\n\nFans can check out his full comments here.\n\nVENTURA: \"I blame the United States people for this too.

    "fullText": "Journalists in Gaza have bartered their lives to tell a truth that much of the world still doesn’t want to hear.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nCan you fathom what it means to be a journalist in Gaza? To go months without holding your children simply because their proximity to you may get them killed?\n\nBefore the war began, I worked as an English-language correspondent in Gaza. I sought out mostly stories of success: The ambition that glittered in the eyes of our children, the enduring cultural traditions of the Strip and its landmarks. We were a people worn down by the scarcity of choice. But we were intent on survival, willed toward a better future, souls nourished by hope and by love.\n\nThen, overnight, in October 2023, I was pushed to become a war correspondent. Some of my first reports came from the inside of the emergency room at Al-Shifa Hospital, where I encountered an endless procession of victims. I shuddered through the sound of bombardment and fire belts, shook at the sight of a charred child, a wounded woman, a mutilated boy.\n\nNot long after, the military declared that the north of Gaza had been made into a military zone—and I was forced to make a decision. A car was prepared to take me south where I could continue to report more formally, protected by the purported safety of my press vest and my profession. This would mean leaving behind my home and family indefinitely, their fate wholly unpredictable. But there was another option. I could stay, stand before a camera without any protection, and explain to the world what was happening to us. I told them I wouldn’t leave.\n\nLet me tell you something I’ve never admitted: I knew, in that moment, that the world would betray us. I knew that everything that had come and everything that was yet to come would not be enough to move the people of the world. My heart writhes in pain over what I endured in the north. And yet here I am, after all these long months, still pleading with the world, still proclaiming my belief in your humanity.\n\nSince the beginning of the genocide, Israel has consistently targeted journalists. It has destroyed our images, strangled our voices, and uprooted our words. These transgressions against Palestinian journalists have only one purpose: to allow Israel to carry out its plans in the darkness, granting its military free rein to commit whatever bloody atrocity it desires.\n\nEach of the 245 journalists killed by Israel had a life, a family, a dream, ambitions. Some were waiting for the birth of their child, others were killed having barely known their newborn. My friend, Yahya Sobeih, was murdered hours after he spent an afternoon handing out sweets in celebration of his daughter’s birth. Mohammed Salameh had plans to marry his fiancée, Hala, only days after he was murdered. Death swallows us whole here. One after the other, our colleagues and friends fall like leaves in autumn.\n\nRecall the morning of August 25, 2025: The Israeli army bombed the Nasser Medical Complex. Two strikes in sequence: a “double-tap.” The first claimed the lives of the journalists, civilians, and doctors who had sheltered in the hospital. The second strike anticipated the arrival of rescue teams and other journalists who had hurried towards the site. It was a coordinated crime that unfolded live before the eyes of the world. Twenty civilians were murdered and countless more were wounded—among them, five of my colleagues, including my friend Mohammed Salameh.\n\nHow can this world live with the reality that there exists an entire people whose hospitals are continuously bombed—hospitals that are overflowing with doctors, patients, with those who have been forced to seek refuge inside its walls? Hospitals that hold journalists who have been forced there to document, moment by moment, the realities of brutal, dirty, greedy war? Have our souls really become so cheap?\n\nShortly after the TV channel, Al-Ghad, liv-streamed the second strike on the Nasser Medical Complex, its Gaza correspondent, Ibrahim Qanan, went to Instagram to explain the predictability of these sort of attacks. “Israel possesses highly precise weaponry,” he wrote. “They knew, without a doubt, that members of the Civil Defense were present in the building when it was struck. But, as they see it, there is nobody standing in their way. Israel commits war crimes on a live broadcast simply because they understand that there is nobody in the international community who is willing to confront them.”\n\nJournalism is supposed to be the fourth estate. The safety of its practitioners is considered sacred, even during times of war or conflict. But in Gaza, journalists have been offered no protection. Instead, they’ve been left to die as they broadcast their daily pleas.\n\nRayan El Amine, Jack Mirkinson, and Lizzy Ratner\n\nOur practice has not fundamentally changed since the ceasefire. We journalists continue to report under immense pressure, enduring the psychological strain brought on by repeated military attacks. Our psyches are now more familiar with war than with peace.\n\nHere’s how Abdullah Miqdad, Gaza’s correspondent for Al Araby TV, has described our present condition:\n\n“The constant psychological fear for a journalist is that escalation and war could return at any moment. Journalistic life cannot go back to what it was before the war. The nature of coverage has changed. It now encompasses all the catastrophic consequences the war has left behind, expanding how daily life itself is reported and examined.”\n\nAmid this precarity, we continue to offer our bodies as proof that the danger we face is real. So many of us have lost family members. Some of us carry those shrouds with us everyday. Others have already penned our wills, anticipating our death at any moment. At night, we forgo sleep for the company of murder and destruction; we will ourselves towards danger. Atop the rubble, we share images of charred bodies, wading through flesh and the smell of blood.\n\nThis is not heroic: We persist because there is no alternative. We have surrendered even the safety of our own families in order to protect the truth.\n\n“Two years of war have left a permanent mark,” the journalist Ibrahim al-Khalili told me, “We have covered events no human can bear.”\n\nHow can a person return to normalcy after witnessing every intimate detail of this genocide? What might heal such a soul?\n\nPerhaps the greatest lesson we have learned bartering with our lives is that the world is truly unconvinced by our words, unmoved by our images.\n\nEven after all this time, many international news agencies continue to treat our work as if it were unreliable, as if we are witnesses unworthy of believing. The truth of our own murder, our own annihilation, can only be verified if told through a voice that parachutes into our desecrated Strip. Our words, drenched in blood, are insufficient; only foreign journalists can truly tell our story.\n\nIn the thrum of this hypocrisy, seeking to minimize their fiscal liability, most international news agencies have turned to another kind of exploitation. They have replaced official employees with contractors, paid monthly or per report or image, and foregone the legal responsibility that guarantees our protection. Our bodies are sacrificed to protect institutions that don’t even believe us. If these news agencies continue to find prominence without honoring our labor and blood, then surely we are entitled to decide who narrates our story—who carries our cause, who bears our words to the world.\n\nWhen one of our colleagues is martyred, a cloud of grief descends on us all, and our strength falters. We have come to know this profession as a subjugation.\n\nThere is a collective understanding among journalists in Gaza that those who have perished will not be the last, that any one of us could be next. Everyday as I report, I think of my family, of my fate. I wonder if my name will be soon added to the list of martyrs simply because I insist on writing, on recording, on sharing the realities we live through. What is being done to us is a stain on a world complicit in our annihilation. But nothing can be taken from us anymore.\n\nAya Jouda, a field correspondent for Tasnim News, has spent years documenting the siege on Gaza. Her persistence, she said, comes from a belief that “to witness these events is a human, ethical, and national duty.”\n\n“Gaza is not a headline, or a statistical report. It is human lives being annihilated beneath bombardment and blockade,” she said. “Yes, when the outside world shows solidarity, it gives me hope. It’s proof that our voices can reach beyond these borders. But when that solidarity is absent, our sense of betrayal deepens and with it, our determination to keep telling the truth, no matter the dangers we face.”\n\nLike my colleagues, I can no longer be stopped. There are days when it feels as though our lives are going to waste; our efforts are pointless, our will to persist misspent. We are sustained, however, by the fragile faith that perhaps, overnight, the world may halt this ruthless war. We await that day with the hope that our lives may one day be lived as they ought to be: in love and in peace.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Feb 3 (Reuters) - Gold and silver prices rebounded sharply on Tuesday after a steep selloff over the previous two sessions, with the bullion on ​track for its biggest daily rise since November 2008 as bargain‑hunters stepped in ‌amid resilient underlying fundamentals.\n\nSpot gold rose 5.2% to $4,906.82 per ounce by 01:31 p.m. ET (1831 GMT), recovering from Monday's low ‌of $4,403.24 but still trading below last week's record high of $5,594.82.\n\nU.S. gold futures for April delivery settled 6.1% higher at $4,935 per ounce.\n\nSilver surged 4.8% to $83.23 an ounce on Tuesday, after a record 27% one‑day decline on Friday and falling a further 6% on Monday.\n\n\"I view the recent losses ⁠as corrective within the long‑term ‌uptrend,\" said Peter Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals. He added many of the fundamentals that have driven gold higher ‍over recent years remain firmly in place.\n\n\"At this point, we are likely to see a period of consolidation, with $4,400 an important support level on the downside and resistance probably around $5,100 on the upside,\" Grant ​said.\n\nPrecious metals retreated sharply over the past two sessions as Kevin Warsh was named ‌the next head of the Federal Reserve, after Chair Jerome Powell steps down in May. Investors expect Warsh to support rate cuts but tighten the Fed's balance sheet. Additionally, the CME Group raised margin requirements on precious metal futures, which further weighed on prices.\n\nDespite the recent volatility, analysts broadly expect the bull market to continue, with the yellow metal likely to ⁠hit fresh peaks later this year.\n\n\"We expect prices to ​resume their longer term rise at a more sustainable ​pace as investors continue to be extremely concerned about economic and political conditions,\" said CPM Group managing partner Jeffrey Christian.\n\nGold is widely regarded as a ‍safe haven and typically ⁠performs well in low interest rate environments.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Monday the closely watched employment report for January would not be released this ⁠Friday due to a partial shutdown of the federal government.\n\nAmong other metals, spot platinum climbed 3.4% to $2,194.05 per ‌ounce, while palladium was up 0.4% at $1,727.03.",

    "description": "There are four things supporting the US stock market's elevated valuation. If any of the key trends reverse, it could threaten gains, Piper Sandler says.",
    "fullText": "As the S&P 500 trades near record highs, Piper Sandler analysts highlight four key supports to valuations, noting that \"a sustained reversal in any of these trends would be a potential risk for the market.\"\n\nDespite some worries on Wall Street that the US stock market is overvalued, the analysts don't expect valuations to move much in either direction in 2026. \"Our view is that multiples stay higher for longer,\" they write.\n\nHowever, Piper Sandler said four factors are propping up elevated valuations, and if any of them break, it could trigger a valuation collapse.\n\nThe analysts note that valuation shouldn't be used as a tool to time the market, but rather a \"condition of the risk perceived by investors.\" Charles Schwab recently underlined this point, noting that while \"valuation is a horrible market-timing tool,\" investors can think of high valuations as a way of knowing if the market is vulnerable to shocks.\n\nHere are the four things that Piper Sandler sees reinforcing high valuations:\n\nCurrent high equity valuations reflect high operating margins, Piper Sandler said. Operating margin growth, which measures the share of sales left after operating expenses, signal improved efficiencies.\n\nHigh margins are largely driven by tech. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk highlighted that in the past 20 years, \"all of the increase in the S&P 500's operating margin has come from tech‑related sectors.\"\n\nAI enthusiasm has not only boosted markets, but is also expected to boost productivity and operating efficiency, supporting high margins. \"Technology is steroids for margins,\" T.Rowe Price global multi-asset head and CIO Sébastien Page said, nodding to the US stock market's historic outperformance compared to global markets.\n\nTight credit spreads mean corporate borrowing costs are low. It refers the \"spread\" between the rates lenders charge companies and a benchmark like Treasury yields.\n\nJanus Henderson Investors' portfolio managers Brent Olson and Tom Ross said that credit spreads could hold tight, highlighting the period of the mid-2000s and late-2010s when spreads hovered near historically low levels. They flagged a strong global economy, additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, corporate bond scarcity relative to government offerings, and updated corporate ratings as reasons spreads should stay tight.\n\nThe \"biggest threat\" to the credit gap, in Janus Henderson Investors' view, is \"some shocking economic data\" signaling a recession or a spike in inflation, which could translate to a Fed rate hike.\n\nOil prices declined in 2025 and, despite seeing an uptick in year-to-date, are still constrained amid forecasts for more supply and uncertain demand.\n\nPiper Sandler compared oil prices to S&P 500 price-to-earnings, to show that relatively low prices support the index's valuation.\n\n\"Lower energy prices have played a key role in recent years in lifting equity multiples,\" the analysts said. They also highlight that low energy costs contribute to real rates feel lower than Treasury yields suggest.\n\nPiper Sandler credits \"waning\" inflation as a support to US equity markets, comparing core personal consumption expenditure data, a measure of inflation favored by the Fed, to market performance.\n\n\"In the post-Covid world, investors have a heightened sensitivity and fear of inflation,\" meaning lower inflation offers a \"boost\" to multiples.\n\nLPL Financial research shows that \"the highest stock valuations have been observed when inflation, represented by the CPI, is lowest, and vice versa.\"",

    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA New Zealand cave has revealed million-year-old fossils, including 12 ancient bird species and four frog species.\n\nExperts believe the discovery shows how drastically New Zealand’s forest culture has shifted.\n\nResearchers said up to 50 percent of species on Aotearoa’s North Island went extinct before humans arrived.\n\nA spectacular trove of fossils in a discovered in a cave on New Zealand's North Island has given scientists their first glimpse of ancient forest species that lived there more than a million years ago. The fossils represent 12 ancient bird species and four frog species, including several previously unknown bird species. Taken together, the fossils paint a picture of an ancient world that looks drastically different than it does today. The discovery also fills in an important gap in scientific understanding of the patterns of extinction that preceded human arrival in New Zealand 750 years ago.\n\nThe team published a study on the find in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.\n\n“This is a newly recognized avifauna for New Zealand, one that was replaced by the one humans encountered a million years later,” Trevor Worthy, lead study author and associate professor at Flinders University, said in a statement. “This remarkable find suggests our ancient forests were once home to a diverse group of birds that did not survive the next million years.”\n\nThe team located the fossils between two layers of volcanic ash preserved in the cave, each from a different major eruption, the first 1.55 million years ago and the second 1 million years ago. Many of the species represented among the fossils had already gone extinct by the time humans arrived on the island. By extrapolation, the research team estimated that between 33 and 50 percent of all species on the island went extinct during the million years before humans arrived in New Zealand, likely thanks to rapid climate shifts and cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, said Paul Scofield, study co-author and Canterbury Museum senior curator of natural history.\n\nWorthy said that “for decades, the extinction of New Zealand’s birds was viewed primarily through the lens of human arrival 750 years ago. This study proves that natural forces like super-volcanoes and dramatic climate shifts were already sculpting the unique identity of our wildlife over a million years ago.”\n\nOf all the finds, scientists might be the giddiest about discovering a new species of parrot, Strigops insulaborealis, an ancient relative of the iconic Kākāpō, a large flightless parrot known for its heft. The team believes this ancestor may have possessed the ability to fly. By analyzing the fossil discovery, the team noticed the ancient bird had weaker legs than the modern relative, implying the ancestor wasn’t quite the skilled climber as the modern-day Kākāpō. Still, the team said more research is needed to confirm that this ancient bird could fly.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered an ancestor of the modern Takahe, which opens further research into that bird. Fossils of an extinct species of pigeon closely related to the Australian bronzewing pigeons also excited experts.\n\n“The shifting forest and shrubland habitats forced a reset of the bird populations,” Scofield said. “We believe this was a major driver for the evolutionary diversification of birds and other fauna in the North Island.”\n\nScofield said that previous excavations showed life in New Zealand between 20 and 16 million years ago and that by contrast, the new discoveries offer the first evidence of life from 15 million years ago to one million years ago. “This wasn’t a missing chapter in New Zealand’s ancient history,” Scofield said, “it was a missing volume.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "From customizable scents from startups to bestselling fragrances from high-end brands.",
    "fullText": "Personalized skincare regimes and tailor-made cocktails are all the rage. However, having a signature scent is the cherry on top of a well-coordinated beauty routine. Selecting the right scent is an important task. That's why we interviewed multiple experts who know perfume exceptionally well to lead you in the right direction.\n\nKalliope Amorphous, Perfume Artist at Black Baccara Artisan Perfumes, who has been a perfumer for fifteen years, says some of the major issues people face when choosing the right perfume are a lack of knowledge about perfume notes, not understanding how they work together and change while they are worn, or trying too many perfumes at once and experiencing sensory fatigue, or starting with heavier perfumes before lighter ones.\n\nPerfume notes are the ingredients that make up a fragrance, and they work similarly to notes in music. When multiple notes are combined, they form accords, which give perfumes their unique structure and presence, says Amorphous. \"Base notes are the notes that anchor the fragrance and are the most long-lasting, while top notes are what you will often smell first but they tend to disappear the fastest, and middle notes usually tie the base and top notes together.\"\n\nWith so many perfumes on the market, we made it easier to find the right scent by narrowing down some of the most popular options. You'll also find expert tips and answers to common fragrance questions.\n\nFragrance is personal, so it's all about what your nose fancies, says Stacey Bresnahan, Founder of Laubahn Perfumes. If your nose follows slightly sweet and musky scents, this product is for you as the black opium awakens the senses. The coffee accord and orange blossom are mild, but intense at the same time, and perfect for evenings.\n\nWhen selecting a perfume, you'll likely find the categorizations of floral, gourmand, or woody helpful, says Vincent, \"They can help as a generalized starting point for perfumes you enjoy. I actually tend to find I like Balsamic, Gourmand perfumes, when actually what I tend to purchase and formulate are Floral fragrances.\" Maison Margiela's line of fragrances, under the name REPLICA, is designed to transport you to sense memory and this floral yet sensual fragrance takes you to a sun-filled vacation with notes of bergamot, ylang-ylang, white musks, and coconut milk.\n\nOne of the most practical ways to customize a fragrance is to consider the time and place you'll choose to wear a particular scent, says Dressel. Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille is a warm and spicy scent that is perfect for date night or going out dancing with friends. This reinvention of a tobacco fragrance combines tonka bean, vanilla, and dry fruit accords with sweet wood sap for an elegant, nighttime perfume.\n\nIf you're looking for a fragrance for the office, you can tailor your daytime fragrance towards a lighter variety, points out Dressel. Glossier You is an open ended perfume that grows on you with its slightly sweet heart of a scent that comes from ambrette seeds.\n\nFounded by stylist and digital influencer Chriselle Lim in 2021, PHLUR is a new brand on the scene that has launched multiple viral fragrances. None more intriguing than the cult-favorite Missing Person, a floral musk with notes of sheer jasmine, neroli blossom, and Australian sandalwood that blend into a delicate, almost skin-like scent.\n\nHenry Rose crafts a fragrance after you answer a short quiz about your preferences. It asks your reason to wear a fragrance, whether you want to feel sensual or to make an impression. According to your flavor palette and understanding of what you want the perfume to evoke, it suggests the right fragrance from the entire collection.\n\nIf you're shopping for a special occasion fragrance, you might want to consider perfumes with richer notes that sustain throughout the evening, says Dressel. Byredo's Gypsy Water has a woody aroma. This unisex perfume has an addictive sandalwood, vanilla, and amber blend.\n\nBresnahan's suggestion for choosing the right fragrance is to start by sampling fragrances with a familiar scent and seeing how it smells on you. If you love the scent of flowers, this one is perfect for all occasions as it smells like a floral bouquet of jasmine, freesia, and rose petals enriched by an addictive scent of patchouli and vanilla.\n\nThis seductive perfume has a sparkling, bold floral-woody fragrance. Middle notes usually last way longer than top notes and add more depth to the scent experience, says Bresnahan. With accords of jasmine and May rose, it's a classic fragrance for every age group.\n\nMake a change and select perfumes that make you feel a certain way, says Emma Vincent, perfumer at Lush. \"Could it smell comforting, or uplifting or make you feel confident - is that what you need right now?\" If it's beauty and that joy you want to feel, this optimistic fragrance that smells of thousands of flowers is the right pick.\n\nWhen you want to change things up, Vincent suggests experimenting with layering perfumes. \"Maybe one day I want to wear a confident perfume such as the one I created for Lush called Nero, and I will layer this with my wedding fragrance I made at Lush called Confetti. The perfumes aren't too clashing, and I can have both confidence and comfort at the same time.\" Lush Karma perfume features patchouli, Brazilian orange, and Siberian fir and is a spicy yet relaxing mix.\n\nDressel points out that studies have shown that stimulating our sense of smell has an immediate impact on our mood, which is something to keep in mind as you are searching for your ideal fragrance. Clarins' Eau Dynamisante Treatment Fragrance is the brand's first fragrance and body treatment in one spa-fresh formula that sets out to calm one's nerves.\n\nScents can smell different on two different people for many reasons, says Amorphous, but the main one is body chemistry. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world. A unique blend of magnolia and musk with tangerine, the Fenty Eau de Parfum expresses itself uniquely on each wearer for a one-of-a-kind scent.\n\nAmorphous points out that some people amplify certain notes more than others; often hormones play a part. \"Even how dry one person's skin is compared to another can make a difference in how they experience the perfume.\" Ralph Lauren Romance is a very good choice for people with dry skin as the chamomile oil and Sungoddess rose blend into the skin to last longer.\n\nVincent encourages being bold and daring when purchasing and wearing perfumes. \"Wear them for yourself first and foremost,\" she says. Marc Jacobs' playful fragrance is a comforting floral scent of rhubarb and bright daffodil. However, if you are looking for something a little less pricey, we've tested Dossier perfume, a brand that makes shockingly spot on yet affordable option of brand name fragrances.\n\nEvenings are a great time to go bold and don a perfume that is stronger and more sensual, if that is the feeling that you would like to evoke, explains Dressel. Created by the famous Spanish perfumer Alberto Morillas, Gucci Bloom is a complex tropical floral fragrance that is meant to be overpowering.\n\nSoft and seductive, Armani's My Way is a bright floral bouquet of tuberose and jasmine from India. It opens with a citrus embrace of orange blossom and bergamot meant to remind you of a summer day in a field of strawberries.\n\nZee Field, designer and founder of LOULOU DAMOUR fashions and Parfums, shared with Insider answers to common fragrance questions.\n\nThe easiest way is to research the olfactive pyramid of one to two fragrances you like and dislike. If you don't like the scent of your co-worker's perfume, this valuable information will help you to exclude those specific notes. Then create your olfactive profile.\n\nChoose an Eau de parfum or a perfume with a higher concentration of oils. A high fragrance concentration means there is less alcohol and more essential oils. Check the concentration of perfume oil on the fragrance bottle or packaging such as parfum – 20-40% or Eau de parfum – 15-20%. Make sure your fragrance is not expired.\n\nA perfume lasts up to five years. It expires much faster if not stored in a cool place as it is very sensitive to sunlight or air if left open without the cap on.\n\nThe best time to apply perfume is right after the shower before getting dressed on the chest area, shoulders, and one wrist. This application should be done at about 10 inches away. The spray of the wrist is a good tip. Once dressed, keep the five spray routines; three on the skin, two on your clothes. One behind each ear, one on the back of the neck, one on your front left shoulder, and one on your back right shoulder. Only Eau fraiche or Eau de cologne should be applied to the pulse points of the body.\n\nIt is best to test a fragrance on your skin. The only issue is that you can only test one scent at a time. I like to start with a blotter strip or card. Spray twice downwards, pass the blotter strip through the fragrance cloud, wave under your nose, and inhale. Then, I move on to the skin test. Wash your hands earlier, not just before testing fragrances, and do not apply any hand cream. Spray onto the back of your hand from a distance of four to six inches, and no more than 10 inches depending on the atomizer pump. Start with just two sprays, and leave until the oil dries.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "Disney's decision to tap Josh D'Amaro signals that the company wanted to go with a familiar, friendly face to push ahead into the AI era.",
    "fullText": "After a decade of ups and downs, Disney is picking a familiar, friendly face at the heart of its profit engine to lead the company into a new era.\n\nDisney's board just tapped Parks boss Josh D'Amaro to take over for longtime CEO Bob Iger, starting on March 18. Iger, who plans to retire as CEO for the second time, will remain in an advisor role before stepping aside for good later this year.\n\nAfter a decade marked by strategic changes and a failed succession, Disney is turning to the guy who runs its most reliable moneymaker to navigate a period of massive change in the entertainment industry.\n\nDisney's new CEO has his work cut out for him. The Mouse House's stock has only mustered an 11% gain in the last decade, compared to a more than threefold increase for the S&P 500. And while Disney's parks are gushing cash, the streaming business isn't yet making enough money to offset the steady erosion of the company's ever-fading cable networks.\n\nHowever, D'Amaro appears as well-positioned as any possible Iger successor to lead Disney into the next decade.\n\nNot only is D'Amaro intimately familiar with the company's most lucrative business, but he also seems to have the charm and leadership acumen needed to lead a juggernaut like Disney. That's in contrast to former CEO Bob Chapek, who took over after Iger's first retirement and was known as a gruff, business-minded executive who lacked Iger's high level of charisma.\n\nYet D'Amaro isn't just a likable face. Here are three points about Disney's choice of D'Amaro and what his leadership could mean for the company.\n\nWhile it's still too early to say how D'Amaro might run things, the board's decision to go with a company insider, who happened to be the consensus pick, signals a preference for stability, analysts and leadership experts told Business Insider.\n\nD'Amaro — who turns 55 on February 10 — has been at Disney since 1998. As Disney's experience chairman, D'Amaro oversees the parks division, which has been a financial standout compared to the fast-eroding linear TV business.\n\n\"The company appears to be reorganizing in ways that shore up his shortcomings,\" Pozner told Business Insider, referring to D'Amaro.\n\nDisney didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on its reasoning.\n\nBecause D'Amaro is 20 years younger than Iger, D'Amaro could have a lengthy run in the top job, she said.\n\n\"He's still got a long time horizon in front of him,\" Pozner said. \"This is really planning for the future. And I think that's a great signal about stability.\"\n\nAnalyst Joe Bonner of Argus Research said it's \"hard to really tell much about anyone under that big shadow\" of Iger.\n\nD'Amaro is known among colleagues for being a likable guy who takes selfies with parkgoers.\n\n\"D'Amaro definitely feels like a man of the people,\" Pozner said.\n\nD'Amaro is \"broadly popular\" and known for being approachable, said a Disney ad sales staffer who said they'd been in the same room as D'Amaro but hadn't met him. This person added that the incoming CEO seems \"very well-liked over at Parks\" and added that it's \"always a good sign when people love working for someone.\"\n\nThat affability could help him forge relationships in other divisions of the entertainment conglomerate — and navigate a new course while Iger initially remains on the board.\n\nPozner said D'Amaro's relative youth and his \"flesh-pressing image\" could signal that Disney's board wants to help the company maintain its friendly perception. That matters because of criticisms, for example, that the costs of the theme parks have become out of reach for some families.\n\nThat concern has worried some investors, who wonder how much consumers will be willing to hand over to spend time at the happiest place on earth, Ben Barringer, global head of technology research at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, told Business Insider.\n\nBarringer said that D'Amaro will likely have to develop new skills to match his broader remit.\n\n\"Dealing with Parks people is different from dealing with studio people,\" Barringer said.\n\nIt could help that Walden is staying at the Mouse House in a major role.\n\nD'Amaro will likely also want to work on his influence skills, Barringer said, in part because moving the company through the big upheaval in the entertainment industry won't be easy.\n\n\"Hollywood faces quite a lot of disruption,\" he said. The ascent of AI and Disney's partnership with OpenAI are signs that more change is coming, Barringer said.\n\n\"Embracing the disruptive threat and trying to leverage it is a good way to start,\" Barringer said, referring to AI.",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's financial markets rallied sharply on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashed U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% ​from 50%, a development that investors said lifts a key overhang over the ‌country's stocks, bonds and currency.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50, surged nearly 5%, about 100 points away from ‌its record high hit in January. The rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading. The yield on the country's 10-year benchmark bond declined 5 bps to 6.72%\n\nThe Nifty's rise put it on course for the best one-day gain in five years while the rupee ⁠was on track for its ‌best day since November 2022.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting ‍that India had agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and lower trade barriers on U.S. exports.\n\nIndian stock markets and the rupee have been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington in late August, ​placing them among the worst-performing emerging market assets in 2025, with record foreign investor ‌outflows.\n\nThe trade breakthrough is expected to alleviate the persistent drag, with investors expecting a bounce-back in foreign sentiment and flows into Indian assets.\n\n\"We believe this trade deal announcement should lift a key overhang on Indian equities. Foreign investors who have been net sellers recently might also look to increase their weight to India in light of this announcement,\" said Prashant Paroda, portfolio ⁠manager with AllSpring Global's Intrinsic Emerging Market equities ​team.\n\nThe trade deal is also expected to lift a ​pall of geopolitical uncertainty which had accompanied the U.S.-India trade rift, keeping investors cautious on plowing money into the country.\n\n\"The key tail risk of geopolitical ‍isolation about which investors ⁠were concerned has now been adequately addressed by back-to-back trade deals with the European Union and United States,\" economists at Citi said in a note.\n\nThe breakthrough with the ⁠U.S. comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that ‌is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by ‌value.",

    "fullText": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said that CEOs are scared of talking about politics — and sick of yo-yoing between politicians to stay successful.\n\nGriffin said that the US government's new style of direct engagement with corporate America is causing some business leaders to question whether their fortunes will change from one administration to the next, depending on their level of public support.\n\n\"When the US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin said at the Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event on Tuesday.\n\nLeaders, he said, would rather focus on creating value for customers and shareholders than catering to an administration.\n\n\"Most CEOs just don't want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,\" he said.\n\nGriffin criticized current and past administrations for their involvement in corporate America, citing green energy investments under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\n\"We don't need the US government to pretend to be venture capitalists,\" he said.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration took a nearly 10% stake in Intel, a few weeks after the president had called on Intel's CEO to resign, but changed his tune after a White House meeting.\n\nWhen asked why fewer CEOs are speaking out about hot-button political issues, Griffin said they're still reeling from prior years, when companies that involved themselves in what he called the \"woke movement\" were either \"embraced or ostracized\" as a result.\n\n\"That's created a level of fear and apprehension among the corporate CEO class to insert themselves in any publicly facing issues these days,\" Griffin said.\n\nSocial media has, he added, taken apprehension to a fever pitch, since sentiment about a company or its product can catch like wildfire.\n\n\"The power of social media to persuade millions or tens of millions of consumers to make a product choice is really terrifying to corporate executives,\" Griffin said. Recent deadly shootings by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Minnesota have pushed some CEOs, from big names in tech to small business owners, to comment publicly on politics again.\n\nGriffin, one of the GOP's biggest donors, was also asked about whether he has plans to run for public office, Griffin said that he hasn't ruled it out. \n\n\"I'd like to believe at a future point in my life I will be involved in public service,\" adding that it was unlikely in the next few years.\n\nIn terms of others' public service, Griffin praised Trump's pick for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, calling the nomination a \"powerful assertion that the Fed will maintain needed independence in policy decision-making.\"",

    "fullText": "The stock market was hit with a wave of selling on Tuesday as traders dumped some of the market's highest-flying tech names and reacted to a spike in oil prices.\n\nLegal-software stocks were a particularly weak point, with many falling by double digits, after Anthropic unveiled new tools that can track compliance and review legal docs.\n\nOn the tech side, investors have been wary of high valuations for months, and are anxiously watching for signs that the AI trade is under pressure. A rotation into other parts of the market that began at the start of the year accelerated in Tuesday's session.\n\nWhile many of the top tech and AI names in the S&P 500, stocks in other sectors jumped as investors looked for better deals. FedEx stock was up more than 5%, and retailers including Walmart, Target, and Costco rose as much as 2%.\n\nMeanwhile, oil spiked and the Cboe volatility index rose nearly 20% on fresh Middle East tensions after the US said it shot down an Iranian drone.\n\nInvestors fear that higher oil prices could weigh on the US economy by causing renewed upward pressure on inflation. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 2% to about $67.50 a barrel, reflecting an 11% increase from its low in December. US oil prices were also up 2% to about $63.50 a barrel.\n\nThe major indexes sank into the red in the early afternoon, but pared the deepest losses. The Dow clawed back much of its drop of more than 500 points and the Nasdaq ended lower by 1.4% after declining by over 2% during the session.\n\n\"The enthusiasm for AI rolls through peaks and valleys,\" Louis Naveillier, the chairman of Naveillier & Associates, wrote in a note on Tuesday during the tech sell-off. \"These higher energy prices will add to inflation pressure,\" he added of the move higher in oil.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were the big moves in the tech sector:\n\nMega-cap tech stocks have been front-of-mind all week as more companies report results for the fourth quarter. Some tech giants, like Microsoft, plunged as investors continue to express concerns over how much firms are spending on artificial intelligence without a clear outlook for how huge capex will translate into returns.\n\nInvestors had been keeping a closer eye on oil prices this year amid geopolitical tensions between the US and other major crude producers, like Venezuela and Iran. In January, some forecasters were eyeing the possibility of an oil shock, a situation where crude prices jump due to supply disruptions, hurting economic activity.",

    "fullText": "The government shutdown is ending. But the fight over funding for the Department of Homeland Security is far from over.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a package of funding bills on Tuesday afternoon that will end the four-day partial government shutdown.\n\nIt's still not clear how DHS will be funded in the long run.\n\nFunding for the department runs out on Friday, February 13, and Republicans have yet to agree to changes to immigration enforcement that Democrats are demanding in exchange for supporting the funding.\n\nWithout an agreement, several government agencies will go unfunded, and if no bill to fund DHS passes for a long time, workers could miss paychecks.\n\nIt would also affect other agencies funded by the DHS bill, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Coast Guard.\n\nHowever, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would be impacted less than other agencies. Republicans voted to give $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July.\n\nIn the wake of Pretti's killing, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer laid out three key demands on ICE:\n\nIn a Tuesday statement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries backed up those points, while also calling for an \"end to the storming of sensitive locations like houses of worship, schools, and hospitals.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Republicans will agree to any of those demands, leaving open the possibility that Democrats won't support a future DHS funding bill.\n\nWhile that may not be an issue in the GOP-controlled House, it would allow Democrats to block the bill in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats but 60 votes are required to advance most bills.\n\nThe partial shutdown began on Friday, after Senate Democrats demanded changes to funding for DHS in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of spending bills that funded DHS, along with the Department of Defense, the State Department, the Treasury Department, and other agencies.\n\nSenators came together and agreed to negotiate changes, passing a new version of the spending package that extends DHS funding for only two weeks in order to give time for negotiations.\n\nBut that bill still had to clear the House again, and with the lower chamber not scheduled to come back into session until this week, funding for those agencies ran out at midnight on Friday.\n\nThis shutdown was only partial, affecting fewer parts of the federal government than the 43-day long shutdown that occurred in the fall.\n\nThat's because lawmakers have already passed bills to fund various parts of the government, including the departments that fund SNAP and WIC payments.",

    "fullText": "This story was produced by the Berks County bureau of Spotlight PA, an independent, nonpartisan newsroom. org/newsletters/gooddayberks.\n\nUPPER BERN — The Trump administration has quietly purchased a nearly 520,000-square-foot warehouse in Berks County as it plans to convert such facilities into immigration detention centers across the U.S.\n\nThe warehouse, located at 3501 Mountain Road in Upper Bern Township, was sold to the U.S. government on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for $87.4 million, deed records show. The purchase was recorded on Feb. 2.\n\nSpotlight PA visited the warehouse, which is located about a mile from I-78, on Jan. 15 and witnessed about two dozen individuals touring the exterior of the building. One man who arrived early to the site that day identified himself to a reporter as ICE.\n\nThe property was most recently called the Hamburg Logistics Center, and before that was the site of the Mountain Springs Arena, a county landmark known for rodeos and demolition derbies. It neighbors an Amazon warehouse and the Mountain Springs Camping Resort.\n\nThe building is one of at least 23 that ICE plans to convert into an immigration detention facility, Bloomberg reports. The Berks County warehouse could house up to 1,500 beds.\n\nICE also finalized the purchase of a warehouse in nearby Tremont Township, in Schuylkill County, on Monday, according to a deed. The Tremont property is located less than 300 yards from a daycare center and has already faced fierce resident opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE did not answer any questions about the Berks County warehouse purchase and instead lauded the agency’s targeting of “vicious criminals.”\n\n“Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE has new funding to expand detention space to keep these criminals off American streets before they are removed for good from our communities,” the spokesperson said.\n\nUpper Bern Township’s solicitor said in an emailed statement that community leaders learned about the sale on Monday. They declined to answer questions.\n\n“The township was not involved in this transfer and has not received any applications from either the prior or new owners regarding the future use of the property,” the statement reads. “The township has no further comment on this matter at this time.”\n\nState Sen. Chris Gebhard and Rep. Jamie Barton, Republicans who represent the area, said they have reached out to federal contacts to gather more information on how the Department of Homeland Security plans to use the warehouse.\n\n“Our immediate concerns include the potential loss of property tax revenue for the host municipality, county, and school district, as well as security and perimeter considerations,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement. “We look forward to engaging directly with the appropriate federal officials to address these issues. Once additional information is available, we will provide an update.”\n\nThe property is assessed at $22 million and currently pays $198,286 annually in county property taxes under the current tax rate of 9.013 mils. Combined with Hamburg Area School District and township taxes, the loss of tax revenue from the federal government’s purchase would be about $624,000.\n\nState Sen. Judy Schwank (D., Berks) declined to comment on the warehouse purchase on Monday. In an earlier interview with Spotlight PA, she called the then-potential sale “deeply concerning,” especially given the reports of mistreatment of people detained in ICE facilities. She released a statement about “ICE’s action in Minneapolis” on Jan. 27, shortly after federal agents killed Alex Pretti.\n\n“My concern is, knowing the track record of some of these other facilities located throughout the country, it’s not good,” she said. “I don’t necessarily want to see something like that being housed in our county.”\n\nThe deed finalized on Monday shows the property was sold to ICE by an LLC connected to PCCP, a national commercial real estate equity firm. The firm purchased the warehouse in 2024 for $57.5 million, deed records show.\n\nReached by phone Monday afternoon, PCCP partner Greg Eberhardt — who is the authorized signatory for 3501 Mountain Road Owner LLC on the latest deed — denied knowledge of the property and its sale, and refused to comment further.\n\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Eberhardt said before hanging up on a Spotlight PA reporter. “I’m not making company comments.”\n\nUpper Bern Township is situated on the edge of Berks and Schuylkill Counties, with a population of roughly 1,600 people. The community is mostly white, with only 2.8% of residents identifying as another race, according to the 2020 census.\n\nBridget Cambria, attorney with Aldea, a nonprofit that provides pro bono immigration legal services, said the detention center will have a “disruptive” and “chilling” impact on Berks County’s immigrant community.\n\n“If there are people that live freely and at peace knowing that they do the right thing, they can do their immigration process or stay with their family or figure out a way to legalize their status, they’re going to be more afraid to do that with a giant detention center in their backyard,” Cambria said.\n\nA 2022 study by the Detention Watch Center and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center found that immigrants were more likely to be arrested by ICE in counties with more detention bed-space.\n\nBEFORE YOU GO… If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

    "description": "Musk's memo announcing SpaceX and xAI's merger is full of space jargon. Here's your cheat sheet to bring the wonky language back down to Earth.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been shy about his inner nerd — just look at his SpaceX merger memo.\n\nOver the years, the billionaire has peppered his company communications with sci-fi culture Easter eggs, physics nerd jargon, and enough dad-joke flair to make comedian Nate Bargatze blush.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Musk's latest internal memo — announcing that SpaceX would merge with xAI — leaned into the kind of words and phrases that might cause you to scratch your head.\n\nIt reads less like a conventional corporate M&A announcement and more like a sci-fi manifesto, invoking \"sentient suns,\" orbital data centers, and humanity's destiny among the stars.\n\nForget \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" here is your hitchhiker's guide to Musk's memo.\n\nThe memo opens with a sci-fi banger, the kind of premise you'd find in a Hollywood script: Musk says his new vision for the combined company is to build a \"sentient sun.\"\n\nThe phrase is meant to convey scale. Musk is imagining an AI system so large, energy-hungry, and centralized that it metaphorically resembles a star. Except instead of radiating light and heat, this \"sun\" would beam computer-generated intelligence back to Earth.\n\nIt's a piece of sci-fi shorthand for extremely powerful, solar-fed AI.\n\nThis is where the memo goes full-on science nerd: \"Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization,\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk is referencing the Kardashev scale, a '60s framework created by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev that ranks civilizations by the amount of energy they can harness. A Type I civilization can use all the energy available on its home planet. A Type II civilization can capture the full power output of its star.\n\nHumanity today is generally thought to sit somewhere below Type I.\n\nHere, Musk is proposing to move massive computing infrastructure — the power-hungry data centers popping up in rural America to fuel modern AI — off Earth and into orbit. In other words, data centers in space.\n\nIn space, he argues, those systems could rely on near-constant solar energy. As Musk put it elsewhere in the memo: \"It's always sunny in space.\"\n\nSpaceX essentially wants to build a floating gas station. Here, Musk describes a dedicated tanker-to-ship bot expected to roll out in 2026, per SpaceNews.\n\nRight now, rockets carry all of their fuel right from takeoff. This system would allow the company's spacecraft to optimize for other storage cabins.\n\nMusk is essentially a giant railgun designed to launch cargo into space using electricity instead of rocket fuel. It's reminiscent of an instrument in the 1937 science fiction novel \"Zero to Eighty.\"\n\nSpaceX is imagining building one on Earth's Moon, where lower gravity and the lack of an atmosphere would make it easier to fling materials into space.\n\nMusk ends the memo with a linguistic flourish.\n\nIt isn't the first time Musk has used the phrase. In 2014, he launched a Montessori-style school for children from 3 to 9 with the same name. The school's curriculum focused on STEM learning and problem-solving, according to its mission statement.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Small Business Administration said in a policy note that green card holders won't be allowed to apply for SBA loans, effective March 1.\n\nThe move is the latest by the SBA as it works to tighten loan restrictions and restructure the agency.\n\nLast year, it tightened a requirement that businesses applying for loans must be 100% owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent residents, up from a 51% standard.\n\nIn December, it issued a policy note that said up to 5% of a business could be non-citizen owned. But the current policy rescinds that, as well as making lawful permanent residents ineligible, too.\n\n“The Trump SBA is committed to driving economic growth and job creation for American citizens – which is why, effective March 1, the agency will no longer guarantee loans for small businesses owned by foreign nationals,\" said SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons in an emailed statement. “Across every program, the SBA is ensuring that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to this agency goes to support U.S. job creators and innovators.”\n\nThe SBA doesn’t give out direct loans, except when they’re related to disasters, but it works with lenders to distribute loans to small businesses. The loans typically have better rates than traditional loans.\n\nSmall business advocacy group the Small Business Majority said the move is “a decision that will limit the growth of small businesses and jobs throughout the United States.”\n\n“The latest decision by SBA fails to recognize that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business as native-born U.S. citizens,” said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer. “Given that reality, SBA’s severe restrictions will have a negative impact on small business creation throughout this country for years to come.”",

    "fullText": "The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is investigating the death of fishing boat captain and reality TV star Gus Sanfilippo, who died last week when his vessel capsized in Massachusetts (per CBS News).\n\nSanfilippo was the veteran captain of the Lilly Jean, which operated out of Gloucester, and a cast member on the reality show Nor’Easter Men. He died along with five of his fellow crew members and a NOAA fisheries observer when the 72-foot vessel capsized on Friday night as temperatures dipped to approximately 12 degrees Fahrenheit. The other victims have been identified as father and son Paul Beal Sr. and Paul Beal Jr.; John Rousanidis; Freeman Short; Sean Thierren; and 22-year-old NOAA observer Jada Sammitt, who recently graduated from an environmental biology program.\n\nThe Coast Guard will oversee the investigation from this point on. “The purpose of a Coast Guard investigation is to identify measures that can improve the safety of life and property at sea, not to assign civil or criminal blame,” said Lt. Cmdr. Brett Igo, the USCG Northeast District investigation oversight coordinator. Igo added that the investigation is expected to last several months, and that information will be released to the public as it becomes available.\n\nRescue officials responded to a distress call at around 7 a.m. local time on Jan. 30 roughly 25 miles off the coast of Cape Ann. After officials were unable to make contact with the crew, the Coast Guard issued an emergency alert and sent a helicopter along with a boat crew to the location. Rescuers found one person dead floating amongst debris of the Lilly Jean, though they have not confirmed whose body was found. Search and rescue efforts were suspended the following day after workers had searched a 1,000-square-mile radius and exhausted all efforts. All of the boat's seven occupants were officially declared dead later that day.\n\n“The decision to suspend the search was incredibly difficult,” said Capt. Jamie Frederick, commander of Coast Guard Sector Boston. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all the family members and friends of the lost crew of the Lilly Jean, and with the entire Gloucester community during this heartbreaking time.”\n\nSebastian Noto, a fellow fisherman who worked closely with Sanfillipo, told NBC Boston that he spoke with his friend just hours before his death. “‘I quit. It’s too cold,’” Sanfilippo reportedly told Noto. “He was calm. He just couldn’t do the cold because the air holes were freezing.” “I was about 30 miles east of him,” Noto continued. “We usually work together all the time. We are like glue, man. We give a lot of information back-and-forth.”",

    "fullText": "The post Australia Imported 2,400 Toads to Save Its Crops—Now 200 Million of Them are an Unstoppable Disaster appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nQuick Take\nCane toads were introduced to Australia in 1935 to control sugarcane beetles, but the toads ignore the beetles while decimating the ecosystem they were meant to protect.\nInstead, they became a highly toxic invasive species with no natural predators.\nCane toads threaten many native reptiles, mammals, birds, and amphibians.\nDespite decades of effort, large-scale control of cane toads remains nearly impossible.\n\nIn 1935, native beetles were wreaking havoc on Australia’s sugar cane crops in Queensland. The beetle larvae lived in the soil and chewed on sugarcane roots, stunting growth or killing the plants. Seeking a natural solution to kill the grubs, the Australian government imported cane toads from Hawaii, with the hope that the toads would eat the grubs and save the sugarcane. Unfortunately, the worst-case scenario occurred. The toads did not keep the beetle populations in check. Instead, they became one of Australia’s most destructive invasive species and an ecological disaster.\n\nSugarcane had become a key crop in Queensland in the late 1800s. Settlers found that Queensland’s humid and warm climate was ideal for growing the plant. However, farmers faced a battle with the grubs of native beetles, especially the greyback cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum), as the larvae were eating the roots of the sugarcane and decimating crops. To help the farmers, the government established the Queensland Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES) in 1900.\n\nEntomologists working for the BSES studied multiple methods for controlling the beetles, finally settling on a relatively new science: biological control. At the time, entomologists were experimenting with the new idea of bringing in natural predators to control pests. Thus entered the cane toad.\n\nCane toads (Rhinella marina) are the largest toads in the world. They are opportunistic predators and eat a diet of insects, small animals, plants, and even pet food and garbage. Cane toads grow up to 10 inches long and weigh up to 4 pounds. These massive toads are also highly poisonous, even as eggs and tadpoles. The toads secrete a toxic substance called bufotoxin, which can kill animals that try to eat them and can irritate the skin or burn the eyes of humans who handle them.\n\nAs you can imagine, introducing cane toads to Queensland brought more problems than they solved. Cane toads are native to Central and South America. However, in the 1920s and 30s, they were introduced around the world to control pests. Today, they are considered invasive species in Australia, the Caribbean islands, Hawaii, and Florida.\n\nIn August 1935, the BSES released 2,400 cane toads into sugarcane plantations in Gordonvale, North Queensland. This wasn’t a well-thought-out plan. According to the National Museum Australia, “Remarkably, no studies of the potential impact on the environment had been carried out. Nor had the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations even determined whether the toad would actually eat the cane beetles.”\n\nThe cane toads thrived in the warm environment. However, they did nothing to control the beetles. Today, beetle grubs are controlled on sugarcane farms with the use of soil-based insecticides.\n\nAccording to the Queensland Government, 75 species of Australian crocodiles, lizards, and freshwater turtles are threatened by the toads. Some of the animals that are in danger of dying after they eat a cane toad include Australian monitor lizards, quolls, tiger snakes, and freshwater crocodiles. Many of these animals are designated as threatened species.\n\nA research study showed that native tadpoles suffered mass mortality shortly after the toads were introduced to Queensland. The study found 1,300 tadpoles from 10 different species had died in one season. Birds are also affected by the toads. For example, cane toads eat the eggs and nestlings of the rainbow bee-eater bird. Research has shown that cane toads have caused a third of the bee-eaters’ nests to fail.\n\nFinally, cane toads have an indirect effect on native species by changing the ecosystem when they arrive in an area. The toads have large appetites and eat many insects. Eventually, the invertebrate population begins to dwindle, which reduces the amount of resources for other species. These cascading changes can have broad implications for complex food webs.\n\nCane toads have no natural predators or diseases that threaten them in Australia. In Central and South America, they are kept in check by natural predators that evolved along with them. For example, many South American snakes are either immune or have some level of immunity to the bufotoxin of the cane toad.\n\nAlso, cane toads are opportunistic feeders and will eat just about anything, even pet food and people’s trash. They breed opportunistically, usually during warm and wet conditions, and can reproduce multiple times a year. Females lay 8,000 to 30,000 eggs at a time. To understand how cane toad populations can explode, consider that most native Australian frogs lay around 1,000 to 2,000 eggs in an entire year.\n\nExperts offer ways to control cane toads if they are found in a small area or a small pond. They suggest collecting and disposing of cane toad eggs from the water or humanely disposing of the adult toads. Community groups offer information on how to recognize adult cane toads and humanely remove them from the environment. However, these control measures are only feasible for small areas and cannot be applied to large populations of cane toads.\n\nDespite the challenges, researchers are looking for novel ways to control the toads. Scientists found they can edit a cane toad egg’s DNA to stop it from growing beyond a tadpole. If scientists can find a way to gene-edit large numbers of eggs, they may have found a solution to control the cane toad population’s growth.\n\nIn another study, scientists had success in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in freshwater crocodiles. Some populations of crocodiles in Australia have declined by more than 70% due to poisoning from ingesting cane toads. In the study, researchers placed cane toad carcasses with the toxin removed, but a nausea-inducing chemical was added. While crocodiles at control sites continued to eat and become sick from poisoned cane toads, those at the treatment sites stopped trying to eat cane toads.\n\nAnother project that began as a citizen science initiative involves a tadpole trap design that can catch thousands of tadpoles. And in an effort to protect the Pilbara from the hopping invaders, scientists are looking into ways to prevent the toads from accessing water. Cane toads cannot survive more than a few days without access to water.\n\nThe post Australia Imported 2,400 Toads to Save Its Crops—Now 200 Million of Them are an Unstoppable Disaster appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Immigration officers with guns drawn arrested activists who were trailing their vehicles on Tuesday in Minneapolis, while education leaders described anxiety and fear in Minnesota schools from the ongoing federal sweeps.\n\nBoth are signs that tension remains in the Minneapolis area after the departure of high-profile commander Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol and the arrival of Trump administration border czar Tom Homan, which followed the fatal shooting of protester Alex Pretti.\n\n“There’s less smoke on the ground,” Gov. Tim Walz said, referring to tear gas and other irritants used by officers against protesters, “but I think it’s more chilling than it was last week because of the shift to the schools, the shift to the children.”\n\nAt least one person who had an anti-ICE message on clothing was handcuffed while face-down on the ground. An Associated Press photographer witnessed the arrests.\n\nICE agents are changing their tactics\n\nFederal agents in the Twin Cities lately have been conducting more targeted immigration arrests at homes and neighborhoods, rather than staging in parking lots. The convoys have been harder to find and less aggressive. Alerts in activist group chats have been more about sightings than immigration-related detainments.\n\nSeveral cars followed officers through south Minneapolis after there were reports of them knocking at homes. Officers stopped their vehicles and ordered activists to come out of a car at gunpoint. Agents told reporters at the scene to stay back and threatened to use pepper spray.\n\nHomeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said agents detained the activists because they hindered efforts to arrest a man who is in the country illegally.\n\nA federal judge last month put limits on how officers treat motorists who are following them but not obstructing their operations. Safely following agents “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge said. An appeals court, however, set the order aside.\n\nBovino, who was leading immigration enforcement in Minneapolis and other big U.S. cities, left town last week, shortly after Pretti's death became the second local killing of a U.S. citizen in January.\n\nHoman, who was dispatched to Minnesota to succeed Bovino, has warned that protesters could face consequences if they interfere with officers.\n\nOperation Metro Surge affecting schools\n\nWalz and education leaders held a news conference to say the presence of immigration officers is frightening some school communities. Brenda Lewis, superintendent of Fridley Public Schools in suburban Minneapolis, said she has been followed twice by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since speaking publicly on Jan. 27 and that school board members have had ICE vehicles outside their homes.\n\nLewis, a U.S. citizen, said she has seen SUVs with tinted windows, multiple masked people inside and out-of-state license plates. She goes on neighborhood patrols near schools with a security guard.\n\n“Students are afraid to come to school, parents are afraid to drop them off,” Lewis said. “Staff are coming to work wondering if today will be the day something happens in one of our buildings.”\n\nShe said Fridley, which has Somali and Ecuadorian families, has added security, adjusted drop-off procedures and increased mental health support. Tracy Xiong, a social worker in the Columbia Heights district, said she has been coordinating grocery deliveries to school families and finding volunteers to drive children.\n\nThere was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Department of Homeland Security and ICE about the concerns of educators.\n\nGrand jury seeks communications, records\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday was the deadline for Minneapolis to produce information for a federal grand jury. It is part of a U.S. Justice Department request for records of any effort to stifle the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Officials have denounced it as a bullying tactic.\n\n“We have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, but when the federal government weaponizes the criminal justice system against political opponents, it’s important to stand up and fight back,” said Ally Peters, spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat.\n\nShe said the city was complying, but she didn't elaborate. Other state and local offices run by Democrats were given subpoenas, though it is not known whether they had the same deadline. People familiar with the matter have told the AP that the subpoenas are related to an investigation into whether Minnesota officials obstructed enforcement through public statements.\n\nNo release for man in Omar incident\n\nElsewhere, a man charged with squirting apple cider vinegar on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar will remain in jail. U.S. Magistrate Judge David Schultz granted a federal prosecutor's request to keep Anthony Kazmierczak in custody.\n\n“We simply cannot have protesters and people — whatever side of the aisle they’re on — running up to representatives who are conducting official business, and holding town halls, and assaulting them,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Bejar said Tuesday.\n\nDefense attorney John Fossum said the vinegar posed a low risk to Omar. He said Kazmierczak's health problems weren't being properly addressed in jail and that his release would be appropriate.\n\nOrder for release of 2 men accused of assaulting ICE officer fails to stick\n\nAnother judge ordered the release of two Venezuelan men who were accused of assaulting an ICE officer, but ICE officials quickly took them back into custody.\n\nAlfredo Aljorna and Julio Sosa-Celis are accused of assaulting the officer the night of Jan. 14. Sosa-Celis was shot in the thigh by the officer during the encounter, triggering protests in Minneapolis.\n\nThe officer said he was struck with a broom and snow shovel while trying to subdue and arrest Aljorna after a car crash and foot chase. But the two men deny assaulting the officer. Neither video evidence nor three eyewitnesses supported the officer’s account.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson held a hearing Tuesday at which he rejected the government’s appeal of a magistrate judge’s order for the release of the two men on the criminal charges. Magnuson ruled that they could go free.\n\nBut an attorney for Sosa-Celis, Robin Wolpert, said in an interview that when she went to speak afterward with her client, who had been in the custody of U.S. Marshals, staff told her that ICE had taken him. She said she wasn’t sure why, or what their next steps would be.\n\nAljorna's attorney, Frederick Goetz, said he didn't know why ICE took his client or their next steps either.\n\nRaza reported from Sioux Falls, South Dakota. AP reporters Ed White in Detroit and Hannah Fingerhut in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every AirPods User Should Know",
    "description": "There are hacks for AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and, well, AirPods.",
    "fullText": "Since their initial launch in 2016, Apple has released nine iteration of the AirPods, from the now iconic white earbuds, to the upgraded AirPods Pro, to the the AirPods Max, Apple's pricey take on over-the-ear headphones. Whatever the model, however, these things are meant to be simple: You open the case, tap a prompt on your iPhone, and presto, your AirPods are ready to go.\n\nDespite their ease of use, however, AirPods are packed with features and settings you can adjust to your liking. Here are 10 hacks you should know if you own a pair Apple's headphones, whether standard, Pro, or Max. (A note: Whenever I refer to \"AirPods settings\" in this article, I am generally referring to the options that appear in the first page of the Settings app on iOS and iPadOS, or the System Settings on macOS, when you're wearing your AirPods.)\n\nI've had a few AirPods in my day, and every time I set up a new pair, I turn on \"Off\" mode. That might read strange, but it's a real thing. Depending on your AirPods model, you might have the option to use Noise Cancellation, which, of course, blocks outside noise; Transparency, which pumps in the sounds around you; or Off, which activates neither. This last choice ends up being great for times you want some noise blockage, but want to preserve the battery of your AirPods. Though I can't speak to AirPods 4 With Noise Cancellation, the Pros and the Max do a good job with this without active noise cancellation.\n\nWhile this option is always present when switching noise modes from Control Center, by default, Apple doesn't include it from switching modes from the stem (or the noise control button on the AirPods Max). If you try to switch, you'll only move between Noise Cancellation and Transparency. To include \"Off\" in this list, you'll need to dig into your AirPods' settings. Scroll down to \"Press and Hold AirPods,\" then choose either \"Left\" or \"Right,\" depending on which AirPods you want to adjust. Here, make sure \"Off\" is selected to add it to the noise control rotation.\n\nLike any other tiny tech, your AirPods will go missing eventually. Mine slip out of my pockets all the time, and usually end up on the floor or under couch cushions. In such cases, you can waste your time retracing your steps and calculating the physics of where your AirPods would have landed, or you could use Find My to find them much faster.\n\nFind My has a few ways to locate your missing AirPods. The first is the most obvious: When you open the app and choose the \"Devices\" tab, you'll see your AirPods last-known location on the map. If you left them behind at, say, someone's house, you'll likely see that here, and know to stop looking under your own furniture. But if you're already in the location Find My says your AirPods are, you have two more tools to pinpoint their whereabouts.\n\nFirst, you can use \"Find\" to get step-by-step instructions on where your AirPods are. If you have AirPods Pro 2 or 3, you'll even have an arrow pointing you in their direction. If you still can't find them, you can tap \"Play Sound\" to play a sound out of any loose AirPod. If you have AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3, you can play a sound on the case itself.\n\nAirPods work best with Apple devices, but that doesn't mean they're exclusive. You can connect your AirPods to any device that supports Bluetooth, which gives the headphones some added flexibility. I primarily use mine with my iPhone, Mac, and Apple TV, but I also connect them directly to the TV itself to use them with my PS5. (Sony's console doesn't support Bluetooth audio, for some reason.)\n\nThe thing is, there's no obvious way to connect your AirPods to non-Apple devices. You'd only know if you looked up how to put your particular AirPods model into \"pairing mode.\" This bypasses Apple's usual pairing system, and opens up your AirPods to any available Bluetooth source. Here's how to kick your AirPods into pairing mode:\n\nAirPods 1, 2, or 3, or AirPods Pro 1 or 2: Place your AirPods in the case, open the lid, then press and hold the button on the back for five seconds, or until the light starts flashing white.\n\nAirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 3: Place your AirPods in their case, hold the case next to the Bluetooth device, then double-tap the front of the case. The light should start flashing white.\n\nAirPods Max; Press and hold the noise control button (the longer button) for about five seconds, until the light starts flashing white.\n\nIt's easy to be numb to the current state of technology, but the fact your AirPods can translate conversations on the fly is possibly the best encapsulation of \"we're living in the future\" of any consumer product right now. AirPods aren't the only earbuds that can do this, but if you have AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, you have the power to have a full conversation with someone who doesn't speak the same language you do.\n\nYou can't just find yourself in a situation where you need Live Translation and use it right away, however. Before you can use the feature, you need to download the target language to your iPhone. To start, go to your AirPods' settings, then scroll down to \"Translation (Beta)\" and choose \"Languages.\" Here, you can tap any of the available languages to download them to your iPhone, which currently include Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified), Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional), English (UK), English (US), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain).\n\nNow, when you need it, you can press the stems of your AirPods at once to launch Live Translate. Alternatively, you can open the Translate app, then choose \"Live,\" then choose the language of the other speaker, as well as your own language. As they speak, you'll hear the translation in your AirPods, and see the text of the translation on your iPhone's display.\n\nFor well over a year now, AirPods have been cleared by the FDA as clinical-grade hearing aids. It might take other people some time to catch up to the look, but if you need them, the AirPods you already own can be as valid a choice as dedicated (and expensive) hearing aids—assuming your have AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Pro 3.\n\nIn order to take advantage of this perk, you'll either need to take a hearing test through your iPhone, or upload an audiogram you performed with an audiologist. You'll find these options in your AirPods' settings under \"Hearing Assistance.\"\n\nAdaptive Audio is one of my favorite things about modern AirPods. If you have AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio will either boost or cap external sounds, depending on how loud or soft those sounds are, while still letting you hear everything that's going on around you.\n\nBut if you've been using Adaptive Mode, and don't care for Apple's default sound levels here, you can adjust them to either let in more or less sound. You'll find the option in your AirPods settings under \"Adaptive Audio.\" Here, slide the slider left to block more sound, or right to let in more noise. After a moment, you'll hear the changes take effect, so you can test which setting sounds best to you.\n\nBack in the day, when you actually had to buy a dedicated camera for photography or videography, that device usually came with a remote so you could snap a picture or start recording while the camera was set up on a tripod. While the selfie has largely killed that practice, there are still plenty of times when you'd benefit from a camera remote for your iPhone, especially if you're trying to capture a group shot with no extra photographer, or you want to record a video without physically touching your phone.\n\nIf you have AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3, you can use your earbuds as remote for your iPhone's camera. To set it up, open your AirPods' settings, scroll down, then tap \"Camera Remote.\" You can either choose \"Press Once\" to have a quick press act as a remote button press, or \"Press and Hold\" to have a long-press achieve the same. Note that this will affect how your AirPods respond in other circumstances: If you choose \"Press Once,\" you can't use the stem to control media playback; if you choose Press and Hold, you can't use the stem to activate Siri.\n\n\"Smart\" tech tries to solve problems, but, often, only makes them worse. AirPods' \"Personalized Volume\" is one such example. The problem: When your environment is too noisy, you can't hear your music; and when things suddenly get quiet, your music might be too loud. So, this feature \"intelligently\" adjusts the volume based on how quiet or loud your surroundings are. In theory, that's great; in execution, it's a nightmare. Since I picked up a pair of AirPods Pro 3, I've wondered why my music suddenly gets quiet, or suddenly starts getting louder, without me doing anything to control the volume. If the feature works for you, you can keep it on, but if you're like me, you'll want this off.\n\nTo disable it, head to AirPods settings, scroll down to \"Audio,\" then turn off the toggle next to \"Personalized Volume.\"\n\nYour AirPods are basically fancy Bluetooth headsets. If you're wearing them, and you get an incoming call, you don't need to pull out your iPhone. Instead, you can answer that call by pressing an AirPod stem once. But you might not also know you have the ability to customize other stem controls while on the call. By default, pressing the stem once during a call acts as a mute and unmute switch, while pressing twice ends the call. But you can swap these controls if you want to. You'll find them in your AirPods' settings under \"Call Controls.\"\n\nYou can use the stem of your AirPods to do things like accept incoming calls or dismiss notifications. However, if your hands are full, you can also use your head to do the same. AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 3 support Head Gestures, which lets you nod your head or shake it from side to side to either accept or decline a call, or reply to (or dismiss) a text.\n\nYou'll need to have Announce Calls and Announce Notifications enabled for this feature to work. You'll find those settings in your iPhone's \"Siri\" or \"Apple Intelligence & Siri\" setting pages. Once enabled, you can go to your AirPods' settings, scroll down to \"Head Gestures,\" then enable the toggle to turn on the feature. From here, you can assign the \"Accept, Reply\" and \"Decline, Dismiss\" actions to either a head nod, or a head shake.",

    "title": "That AT&T 'Rewards' Text Is a Scam",
    "description": "Don't click to claim your \"expiring\" rewards.",
    "fullText": "A new phishing campaign identified by Malwarebytes Labs targets AT&T customers with text messages about expiring rewards points. Users are urged to claim their rewards ASAP by clicking the included link, which is actually designed to harvest sensitive personal information.\n\nTargets for this scam have received texts containing a \"Rewards Expiration Notice\" urging them to redeem points in their AT&T account before they are scheduled to expire. The message includes a specific points balance and expiration date along with two \"recommended redemption methods\":\n\nAT&T Rewards Center: [shorturl link]\n\nAT&T Mobile App: Rewards section\n\nAs Malwarebytes discovered, the short link sends users to a https://att.hgfxp[.]cc/pay/, a spoofed website with AT&T branding, headers, menus, and links out to the real AT&T domain. Users are directed to enter their phone number to verify their account, which leads to a screen warning that their points are set to expire. Further down, you can see redemption options, including an Apple Watch Series 9, Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones, and Amazon gift cards.\n\nIn order to claim a reward and arrange delivery, victims are then prompted to enter more personal information—which is transmitted directly to the scammers. Malwarebytes notes that the forms have real-time validation and error highlighting so users are less likely to suspect the fraud.\n\nThis scam relies on social engineering tactics—like a sense of urgency and the fear of missing out—to trick targets into engaging. And while it does have a somewhat believable look and feel as well as a multi-step approach to build user trust, it also has some clear red flags. The text originates from a regular phone number rather than a short code, which is often used for automated messages, and the sender doesn't appear as a recognized AT&T contact. The thread also includes multiple recipients and a generic greeting. (A legitimate message from AT&T will be sent directly to you.)\n\nThen there's the shortened URL that leads to a website not owned by AT&T. While the page has some realistic branding and working links, it also has a number of typos and grammatical and formatting errors. Malwarebytes found that if you click the link on different days, the expiration date on the site changes.\n\nAs always, don't click links in unsolicited texts. AT&T does have a rewards program, but you should go directly to that portal via the web or app to manage your rewards.",

    "title": "What's the Difference Between the 'Surface Web' and the 'Deep Web'?",
    "description": "These are two very different sides to the internet.",
    "fullText": "In 2024, the world wide web was made up of 149 zettabytes of data. That's 149 trillion gigabytes, or 149 billion terabytes—whichever helps you wrap your head around that gigantic number. Suffice it to say, the internet is a big place. It's so big, in fact, that you can't access all of it the same way. There are actually different tiers to the web, and depending on with tier a piece of content you're looking for is on, you may or may not be able to view it—even if you know where to find it.\n\nThat's the crux of the difference between the \"surface\" web, and the \"deep\" web. These are two separate parts of the internet that are also part of the larger world wide web. While these two tiers are quite different, you've visited content on both of them before. In fact, you likely visited both surface web pages and deep web pages today, multiple times, without ever realizing it.\n\nThe surface web, also known as the visible web, is really true to its name: This is the part of the web you can easily access through search engines, as they are indexed by platforms like Google. As a rule of thumb, if you can google it, it's on the surface web. The article you're reading right now is on the surface web, for example. Maybe you found it by searching \"difference between surface web and deep web\" on Google. The same applies to Lifehacker as a whole, as well as articles on websites like Mashable, CNET, and PCMag.\n\nYou likely spend a good amount of your internet time on the surface web, on websites both old and new. Forums like Reddit are largely fully represented on the surface web, as are some Instagram pages. Listings for products you can buy on websites like Amazon and Best Buy are surface web pages. Video platforms like YouTube are very much the surface web, including TikTok—though the experience for the latter is not optimized for web browsers. Legacy websites like AddictingGames (which is still playable in 2026), as well as the site for the 1996 movie Space Jam are the surface web. A lot of the surface web is made of up individual articles, which makes sense, since articles still make up a large amount of search engine results.\n\nLike the surface of the ocean, the surface web is just a fraction of the internet as a whole. Back in 2017, some estimates claimed the surface web made up just 10% of the entire internet. That's still a huge number of websites, which tells you how big the overall web really is.\n\nIf the surface web is everything you can find via Google, the deep web is everything you can't. The deep web is much larger than the surface web, and is compromised of websites that are not readily accessible from search engines or direct URLs. They're often locked away behind authentication. That means you need at least a username and password to access them, and in many cases, they require an additional form of authentication as well. The article you're reading is on the surface web, but the software (content management system, or CMS) we use to write and publish the article is not—our CMS is still a website, but it's not something you can find in a Google search, and even if you knew the direct URL, you wouldn't have access.\n\nIt's the same with the many sites you access that only you have permission to view. Think about something like Gmail: The service's homepage is accessible to everyone, and it's something that pops up when searching \"Gmail,\" but to access your Gmail inbox, you need to log in. Once you do, your inbox is accessible via the website, but it's not like anyone can see it with a URL, and they certainly can't find your inbox from a Google search. It's the same story with your Facebook feed, YouTube account, or your banking information. These are all accessible in your web browser as websites, but you need to log in to view them.\n\nThat's also the case for services and subscriptions. Think about stuff like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO: These are all accessible in your web browser, which means you're streaming the content on individual web pages. But the players on those web pages cannot be accessed from Google, even if the landing pages for a particular show or movie can be. In order to actually watch or listen to the content, you need to sign into your account. That's not the case with all streaming services, of course: Happy Gilmore on Tubi is a surface web page, since it's indexed on Google. Some of the deep web is also made up of pages you'll never see, such as protocols for identifying user accounts and running payments behind the scenes. It's not all paywalled content.\n\nMaybe you've also heard about the dark web, but don't quite know what it is. As such, you might conflate the deep web and the dark web, but the two are not identical. In fact, the dark web is a part of the deep web; it's just the part you can't access with a traditional web browser. In order to access the dark web, you need a specialized browser, like Tor, and knowledge of the unique dark web URLs, which typically end in .onion instead of .com or .org.",

    "title": "YouTube Just Blocked This Popular Hack for Free Background Play",
    "description": "A third-party browser might not be enough to replace a YouTube Premium subscription anymore.",
    "fullText": "For Christmas, I got my husband and myself YouTube Premium, and as much as I hate paying for yet another streaming service, it's pretty dang nice. There's ad-blocking, sure, but there are also other bonuses, like additional playback speed options and audio that continues to play in the background when you lock your phone. However, some users have developed hacks to get a few of these features without a subscription, believing they should be included with the site's free tier rather than being locked behind a paywall. Google's been cracking down on ad blockers for a while, but now it's coming after another common YouTube hack—free background play.\n\nPerforming this hack was simple. In many cases, you simply needed to watch YouTube in a non-Chrome browser (and definitely not the official YouTube app). Samsung Internet, for instance, had free YouTube background play officially built-in, with the company even publishing official tutorials on how to use it. Brave also offered this feature, as did Vivaldi. If your browser didn't support free background play by default, you could also usually find an extension for it.\n\nUnfortunately, according to reporting from Android Authority, the hack no longer seems to work in most cases. Toward the end of January, the site noticed that users across Samsung Internet, Brave, and Microsoft Edge complained that free background play no longer worked for them, even when enabled in their browsers or through an extension. Now Google has responded to a question sent by the publication, confirming that it purposefully broke free background play in third-party browsers, whether enabled in the browser's settings or through an extension.\n\n\"Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all out platforms.\"\n\nWell, dang. I've reached out to Google for additional comment, but it seems the eye of Sauron is upon us. Google is now officially cracking down on more than ad blocking.\n\nThat said, while Google's efforts do seem to be affecting many users, not everyone is unable to access background play without paying.

    "title": "How to Keep Your Gym Gear From Stinking",
    "description": "You clothes don't have to reek, nor does your shaker bottle.",
    "fullText": "Does your gym bag reek? You’re not alone, but it doesn’t have to be this way. With proper care, you can keep your workout gear stink-free. The key is to do yourself a favor and start taking care of everything before it starts to smell. But even if you’ve already let things get bad, I have some tips for you.\n\nI'll get into specifics below, but first, it can help to understand why the gym stink develops on clothing and other items that contact your skin. You sweat into them, but it's not the sweat itself that is the problem. It's the bacteria that feed on your sweat. So you'll need to either get rid of the sweat before the bacteria can grow, or handle your clothes and gear in a way that the bacteria won't be able to grow. (It's the same deal with shaker bottles, except substitute food residue for sweat.) If you take nothing else away from this article, just remember this: for the love of God, rinse everything immediately, or at least air your shit out.\n\nA lot of gym clothes these days are made of synthetic fabrics because they provide stretch or sweat-wicking features to keep us comfortable. The downside is that bacteria can cling to synthetic fibers in a way that makes them nearly impossible to wash off. So it’s important that we don’t let those germ colonies grow in the first place.\n\nThe bacteria I’m talking about are the ones that digest your sweat and skin oils. I know, gross. But that means it’s not the sweat itself that causes stinking, but rather the bacteria that multiply while your sweaty shirt is sitting in the laundry basket.\n\nNip this problem in the bud by rinsing the sweat out of synthetics as soon as you take them off. I do this in the shower, squeezing out each garment and hanging it to dry. A set of extra shower curtain hooks will give you a place to hang them. I put up a basic tension rod in the back of my shower for exactly this reason. If you shower at the gym, squeeze those garments out and roll them up in your towel until you get home.\n\nIf you can't rinse your gym clothes right after wearing, or if you have a whole workday in between your shower and your access to laundry, air your clothes out. Cotton clothes don’t have these problems, by the way. If you wear cotton socks or t-shirts, they can be chucked into the laundry whenever and however you like.\n\nYou may never be able to completely remove the stink, but you’ll have the best luck with detergents that contain enzymes or that bill themselves as being good for “sport” or “performance” fabrics. I’ve had good experiences with both Hex (a detergent) and Lysol laundry sanitizer (which you add to the rinse, like a fabric softener). I use one or the other, not both. Either of these can also be used for a soak: soak your gross clothes in a bucket with the Hex or Lysol laundry sanitizer, and then wash as usual.\n\nAnd for a finishing touch, if you really want to be sure you've gotten the stink out, hang the clothes outdoors (or lay them on a surface, like your deck) on a sunny day. Fresh air helps, and sunlight really does kill some of those stench-producing bacteria.\n\nLook, you can try baking soda or vinegar (not together), but I haven't found those to help. If you want a chemical answer to your problems, just get a bottle of Hex.\n\nWhat about things that can’t be quickly rinsed and dried, like your shoes and the gym bag itself? Or, worse, your neoprene knee sleeves? These items stink up most easily when they stay damp and warm. If you wanted to make a gym bag smell as much as possible, I would tell you to fill it with sweaty gear, lock it in the trunk of your car, forget about it until the next gym day. So if that’s your habit already, stop it. You need to air those suckers out.\n\nIf your bag has a mesh compartment for sweaty gear, make use of it. And if you can tie objects to the outsides of the bag—hanging your shoes by their laces, for example—that will help, too. But ultimately what you really want to do is open up the bag as soon as you get home. I always make sure that if my knee sleeves are deep inside the bag, I bring them up to the top to make sure they can get some air. And my shoes are in a mesh compartment, but if I have an extra minute, I’ll open up that compartment and loosen up the shoes so they get as much air flow as possible.\n\nMost of the things in your gym bag can be washed, but check manufacturer’s instructions for the best methods. For example, SBD says to hand wash knee sleeves with soap or a wetsuit detergent, but not to put them in the washing machine or dry them with heat.\n\nJust as with clothes, another good option is to hang or lay out your items in the sunshine and fresh air for a few hours. Sunlight will kill some bacteria, and a good airing-out never hurts.\n\nAvoid spraying things down with vinegar (I’ve never found this to be effective), rubbing alcohol (degrades some materials, so check with the manufacturer), or vodka (unnecessarily expensive, just buy rubbing alcohol and then see above about why you might not want to use rubbing alcohol).\n\nFinally, we come to the bane of many a gym bro’s existence, the stinky shaker cup. If you leave residue from your protein shake in there—especially a milk-based one, like a shake made with whey powder—it can go rancid, and the smells can seep into the plastic where they may never really go away.\n\nTo prevent this, rinse your shaker cup immediately after you drink the shake. Don’t tell yourself you’ll do it when you get home, because we all know you won’t, and honestly, that's too late anyway. You don’t have to fully wash the cup at this point, just rinse it out in the bathroom sink. Or do what I do, and chug your shake at home, over the sink, and wash the cup while it’s still in your hand.\n\nYour Hail Mary hope is to wash it really well. Use soap and hot water. Soak it for a bit if you like. Scrub all the little nooks and crannies (like where the spout meets its cap) to make sure no residue is left. Air it out to dry for a few days; you can even try the sunlight trick above. But if that doesn’t work, buy a new shaker cup, and treat this one right.",

It makes such a difference. We've been waiting a few years to get into this position and we're certainly going to enjoy it [the final].\n\n\"It's the best vitamins that we can put in our bodies because we're playing every three days. But the fact that you worked so hard to achieve those moments and to have these moments together is just magical.\n\n\"You can see the joy, the smile, the energy and everything that works at the club.\"\n\nMidfielder Declan Rice, added: \"We deserve it. The last three or four years we've been at the top of the Premier League, competing and got really close but haven't been good enough.\n\n\"That's why this season we have that extra desire and fire in our bellies to go one step further in every competition. There's a long way to go but to be in a cup final with this club is amazing.\"\n\nFor the last few years, Arteta's Arsenal reign has been a story of near-misses, both in cup competitions and in the Premier League.\n\nNow, just one game away from ending their trophy drought, are the Premier League leaders about to silence accusations of being the 'nearly men' for good?\n\nEx-Arsenal defender Matt Upson told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It has been a few years in the making and there has been a steady build-up to this point for Arsenal. Mikel Arteta has been laying the foundations, building the ethos, and togetherness of the team.\"",

Every set-up is the same.\n\n\"Someone can try something different to stop this brilliant form of attack. What can teams do different to create more space? If they leave three up, Arsenal have to leave at least three, maybe four players back.\n\n\"Then, in the defending box, that leaves a lot more space for the defenders and the goalkeeper. Yes, it leaves more space for the forwards as well, but all those numbers caused so much confusion.\"\n\nSince the start of last season, Arteta's men have scored 53 goals from set-pieces across all competitions - 13 more than anyone else in the Premier League.\n\nAnd Chelsea's tactic - while not enough to secure them a place in the EFL Cup final - at least stopped Arsenal from scoring from a set-play.\n\nEx-Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp was less impressed though.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"I like the plan, but my problem is Enzo Fernandez was left marking Gabriel and he has 10 yards to attack the ball.\n\n\"Chelsea are trying to negate there being too much traffic in the area, which Arsenal try to cause chaos with.
