    "description": "Can Adolis Garcia save the Phillies offense in 2026?",
    "fullText": "The Phillies made their choice. It likely wasn’t the one you or I would have made, but it is one in which the fate of the Phils offense will likely rest.\n\nAdolis Garcia will be the everyday right fielder in 2026. Nick Castellanos, although still technically a member of the Philadelphia Phillies as of this writing, will soon be gone. For a team that entered the off-season with major question marks in the outfield, Dave Dombrowski and the front office decided to go with Brandon Marsh and Otto Kemp in left field, rookie Justin Crawford in center and Garcia in right.\n\nFor a team in desperate need of some right-handed power, it is hoped Garcia will be able to do what Castellanos has not during his time in Philly — bring consistent pop in the middle of the lineup.\n\nOh sure, Nick had his moments. For a little while there, the 2023 playoffs were his plaything.\n\nFor all his warts, Castellanos could do damage when he was hot. Unfortunately, that wasn’t all that often.\n\nEnter Adolis Garcia, who is the most important player in the Phillies’ 2026 lineup.\n\nWhy Garcia? We know Trea Turner, Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber are the heartbeats, and we know what they’re going to be. All three have consistently produced to the backs of their baseball cards (and then some) over the last two seasons, but the lineup tumbles off a cliff once the No. 4 spot shows up. The Phils have simply not received enough production from the middle of the order the last two seasons, and the hope is Garcia will fix that particular issue.\n\nOver the last two seasons, the No. 4 spot in the lineup has produced 42 home runs, 23rd in MLB. Their .411 slugging percentage ranks 18th. Their .726 OPS is 19th. Alec Bohm has accumulated the most at-bats in the cleanup spot over the last two years, leading the team with 12 dingers in 550 plate appearances. Schwarber has 157 PAs batting cleanup and has 10 homers. Castellanos had the 2nd-most plate appearances hitting fourth, he hit 9 bombs, followed by J.T. Realmuto’s 8 home runs in 259 PAs. Outside of Schwarber, Bohm is the only Phillies player with a wRC+ that is at least league average (wRC+ 100) batting cleanup.\n\nMarsh has just 46 PAs hitting cleanup, most of them coming after entering games as a pinch hitter against a left-handed pitcher, hence his 146 wRC+ and .526 slugging percentage in those instances.\n\nFans have been crying for the Phils to add a legitimate right-handed bat with pop all off-season. Heck, the last two seasons, and they rightfully doubt Garcia is the answer. Given their failed pursuit of Bo Bichette last month, Dombrowski and the front office indicated he thought there was room for improvement as well.\n\nAnd yet, the Phillies chose not to pursue 3B Eugenio Suarez, who hit 49 home runs a season ago and signed a one-year, $15 million contract with the Reds, $5 million more than Bohm will earn in 2026. Here is how those two players performed last year:\n\nSuarez: 125 wRC+, 49 HRs, 118 RBIs, 3.8 fWAR\n\nBohm: 105 wRC+, 11 HRs, 59 RBIs, 1.7 fWAR\n\nBohm is the de facto choice to hit cleanup for the Phillies as spring training gets underway due to his ability to hit for average and get on base. Comparing Garcia and Bohm over the last two years, Bohm has been the superior player.\n\nBohm: 4.4 bWAR, 1,110 PAs, 288 hits, 26 HRs, 156 RBIs, 7 SB, .283/.332/.430, .762 OPS, 109 OPS+\n\nGarcia: 3.1 bWAR, 1,184 PAs, 245 hits, 44 HRs, 160 RBIs, 24 SB, .225/.278/.397, .675 OPS, 96 OPS+\n\nOf course, for a cleanup hitter, home runs are a pretty big deal, and Garcia has far outpaced him in that category. Garcia also has a higher ceiling than Bohm, as evidenced by his 2021-23 campaigns.\n\nGarcia 2021: 3.9 bWAR, 31 HRs, 90 RBIs, .741 OPS, 100 OPS+\n\nGarcia 2022: 3.7 bWAR, 27 HRs, 101 RBIs, .756 OPS, 108 OPS+\n\nGarcia 2023: 4.5 bWAR, 39 HRs, 107 RBIs, .836 OPS, 127 OPS+\n\nDombrowski knows how badly the team needed right-handed power in the middle of the lineup, and yet his ultimate decision was to sign Garcia to a one-year deal early on in free agency. They hope Garcia will resemble something similar to what he was during his three years of glory in Texas.\n\nThat ceiling is what makes Garcia the most important part of the Phillies lineup in 2026.\n\nWe know what Bohm can and cannot do. We know what Realmuto is at this stage of his career. We know Otto Kemp is not the answer. We know Brandon Marsh and Bryson Stott are decent, if unspectacular offensive performers. And we know that Castellanos didn’t have anything left in the tank, either.\n\nFor this offense to work, Garcia will need to hit a bunch of bombs and not be a disaster in terms of getting on base. Most projection models don’t see a return to the type of glory he experienced during his elite three-year run as one of the game’s biggest power threats (stats via Fangraphs).\n\nEven these numbers likely puts Garcia second or third on the team in home runs, although they still show him as a relative average-to-below average offensive players for his position. But, optimistically, if Garcia can perform a bit better than these numbers and provide 30-35 home runs hitting behind Turner, Schwarber and Harper, it could make all the difference.\n\nSuddenly, there would be a real power threat in the middle of the lineup, allowing Bohm, Realmuto, Marsh and Stott to slide into more comfortable positions. It would also relieve pressure on Justin Crawford to produce right away.\n\nFor the Phillies offense to hum in 2026, Garcia must be better in 2026 than he has been the last two years. It could make all the difference as the Phils try to win a third-straight division title.",

    "description": "Scott Pianowski previews the second base landscape for 2026 fantasy baseball with his top players to target and fade this season.",
    "fullText": "The first thing to recognize about second base this year is that it’s not deep at the top. A modest six players at the keystone currently have Yahoo ADPs in the top 100, and that’s if we graciously include Jose Altuve and Nico Hoerner, who are percentage points over the cutoff. This makes second base the least bountiful infield slot of the four positions. Third base is the next position of concern, first base is on the upswing, and there are fun shortstops everywhere you look.\n\n[Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for the 2026 MLB season]\n\nIf you don’t land one of the top six at second base, you’ll have to accept some flags from your later picks. Some players are clearly missing a skill or two. Some are talented players coming off poor years or injury-wrecked ones. There are players changing teams. And a few candidates are on the back-nine of their careers, when decline is obviously a risk.\n\nOn the plus side, a lot of these players are versatile, too. Two-thirds of the top-30 second basemen offer multiple positions of eligibility, and several of these players can cover three positions or more. I always prefer being as flexible as possible with my roster builds (allowing me to be positionless when I need fill-ins), and several of these players can help with that goal.\n\nBill James told us moons ago that versatile players tend to be underrated, and Turang is one of those guys. He quietly led all second basemen in oWAR last year and yet is just the third keystoner off the board, 2-3 rounds after Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Ketel Marte. Even if Turang doesn’t keep last year’s power spike, his plate-discipline skills point to a plus average, and he could easily swipe more than the 24 bags he collected last year (he stole 50 in 2024). Turang also holds a good batting slot, hitting second for a plus Milwaukee offense. The Brewers are a quietly-efficient team (they've become the NL's version of the Rays), and Turang is an eat-your-veggies type of pick.\n\nOkay, you’ll have to make up the power elsewhere. But Edwards has a .298 average and .343 OBP since hitting the majors, which marks his territory in the leadoff spot. And with a glittering success rate of 85.1% on steals, Edwards probably has the upside to swipe 40-60 if so inclined. Remember, he stole 31 bags in just 70 games two years ago.\n\nAltuve’s 26 homers last year obscured some leakage elsewhere — he lost 30 points in his batting average and his steals dropped from 22 to 10. And his bat speed has been well under league average ever since Baseball Savant started tracking it. Altuve is a guess hitter at this point in his career, and he’s stepping into his age-36 season. I’d rather be a year early than a year late with a player holding this career arc.\n\nAlbies has been a below-average offensive player (by OPS+) in three of the past four seasons. He continues to swing at too many pitches out of the strike zone, and his batted-ball metrics have been below code for two straight years. The Braves have caught on; Albies will probably open the year in the bottom third of the order.\n\nSemien has long been one of my favorite players, but I can’t ignore that his OPS+ has been merely 100 — that’s exactly league average — for two straight years. He’s now in his age-35 season, and he’ll lose some volume with the Mets, who won’t need him batting first like the Rangers did.\n\nThe Cardinals have openings at second base and third base with Brendan Donovan and Nolan Arenado gone, so Wetherholt should settle in somewhere, assuming he has a decent camp. The team’s No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft (seventh overall), Wetherholt posted a snappy .306/.421/.510 slash between Double-A and Triple-A last year, with 17 homers and 23 steals through just 109 games. He’s already receiving some Rookie of the Year buzz.\n\nIt’s encouraging that García had 16 homers and 14 steals in what could fairly be termed an off year — that’s probably his floor. He’s still just 26 and a year removed from a .282 average and .444 slugging percentage. It’s possible García will shift to first base this year and he could fall into a platoon as well — at least it would be the heavier side of the platoon. There’s no reason to jump the line with García’s ADP. But he’s affordably priced for a player who’s already shown the ability to be a top-100 fantasy asset.\n\nYou can find our complete second basemen rankings for the 2026 fantasy baseball season here.",

    "fullText": "Even after finishing on top of the timesheets on the opening day, Marc Marquez wasn’t shy about making adjustments to his new Ducati GP26 during the second day of testing in Sepang.\n\nThe 32-year-old got off to a strong start at the first pre-season test of 2026, posting a best lap time of 1:57.018 on Tuesday. That put him 0.256 seconds ahead of the rest of the field and nearly three-tenths clear of the fastest non-Ducati rider.\n\nThat session was also Marquez’s first time back on a MotoGP bike since last October’s Indonesian Grand Prix, where he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury following a collision with Aprilia’s Marco Bezzecchi. The recovery kept him out for several months and required surgery.\n\nBut even with a solid start under his belt, Marquez spent much of Wednesday looking for improvements. He finished down in 15th place, with his best lap coming early in the morning session before rain disrupted any chances to improve further in the afternoon.\n\nMarquez used the Sepang test as an opportunity to experiment with Ducati’s newest front aero package. The Italian team had already showcased this bold design during last week’s shakedown in Sepang, featuring an updated fairing, larger wings, and several other adjustments.\n\nThe latest front aero is particularly noticeable because of its increased wing size, internal ducting changes, and a reworked airbox inlet. But as Jack Appleyard pointed out on MotoGP’s Midday Live during the second day of testing in Sepang, Marquez decided to switch back to the 2024-spec front aero.\n\n“The wings are so big, will be creating so much downforce, that he said it altered the balance of the bike so drastically that it’s going to take some time to really work out how to maximise that new aero, because it is so drastic on the front end.”\n\nThe early feedback from all four factory-contracted Ducati riders has been positive, with several drawing comparisons between the GP26 and the successful GP24. It was on that older model where Jorge Martin edged out works rider Francesco Bagnaia to claim the title.\n\nAfter setting the pace on day one, Marquez felt “everything” was working “quite well” for Ducati. But even with a strong start, there’s still work to be done before the next test at Buriram and the Thai Grand Prix in March.\n\n“Of course, you feel a big change on the aero,” Marquez said about Ducati’s 2026 aero after day one at the Sepang test, via Crash. “It’s true that we need to be super patient with new aerodynamics, because the bike balance changes a lot.\n\n“It’s there where we still need to work. It will be important to decide well, because the fact that the Thai test and Thai GP are super close, we need to be super clever here with all of the things.”\n\nWhy Francesco Bagnaia feels more confident after first Ducati test\n\nMarc Marquez’s message to Ducati about his injury recovery ahead of Sepang test\n\nMaverick Vinales open to one rider replacing Brad Binder at KTM in 2027",

    "fullText": "An attorney with the NCAA said Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar's \"sudden change of tune\" made his request for a temporary restraining order seem unnecessary. But the Feb. 4 filing came too late. A Knox County judge had already granted the request.\n\nAguilar was granted a temporary restraining order against NCAA eligibility rules by Chancellor Chris Heagerty on Feb. 4, the first step toward Aguilar’s potential return for the Vols in the 2026 season.\n\nHeagerty filed his decision at 8:22 a.m. NCAA attorney Taylor Askew didn’t file his motion until 9:14 a.m., according to the court filings.\n\nThe order gives Aguilar a 15-day window, prohibiting the NCAA from restricting his eligibility because he played junior college football before his Division I career. But it's just a short-term measure. The next step for Aguilar is to seek a preliminary injunction, which could extend his eligibility to the 2026 season. A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Feb. 6.\n\nAguilar, 24, has spent seven years in college football, but only three seasons at NCAA member schools. That's why he is challenging the NCAA eligibility rules regarding junior college players.\n\nThe NCAA’s filing was specifically geared toward Aguilar not receiving the temporary restraining order, though the arguments go to the larger point of keeping him from obtaining another year of eligibility.\n\nHere are the NCAA’s reasons against the temporary restraining order:\n\nThe 2024 federal court ruling granting Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia another year of eligibility was meant to be “at to Pavia” alone and several similar requests in Tennessee have been denied including UT basketball’s Zakai Zeigler and UT baseball’s Alberto Osuna\n\nWhen Aguilar was part of the ongoing Pavia lawsuit, he didn’t request a temporary restraining order, just a preliminary injunction allowing him to play football this fall. “His sudden change of tune makes his current request for a TRO seem unnecessary.” Any cause for urgency is because Aguilar waited to file.\n\nIn a statement, reported by On3 after the temporary restraining order was granted, the NCAA said the order “illustrates the impossible situation created by differing court decisions …”\n\n“We will continue to defend the NCAA’s eligibility rules against repeated attempts to rob high school students of the opportunity to compete in college and experience the life-changing opportunities only college sports can create.\n\n“The NCAA and its member schools are making changes to deliver more benefits to student-athletes, but the patchwork of state laws and inconsistent, conflicting court decisions make partnering with Congress essential to provide stability for all college athletes.”\n\nHeagerty gave four reasons for the temporary restraining order:\n\nPlaintiff has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claim that the NCAA’s “JUCO rule” violated the Tennessee Trade Practices Act.\n\nImmediate and irreparable injury will result to the Plaintiff if the restraining order is not issued. Every day that Aguilar’s future remains uncertain leaves him unable to prepare for the next step of his career.\n\nThe balance of harms favor Plaintiff. The requested relief runs only to Aguilar. And the NCAA suffers no harm if Aguilar can play NCAA football for a fourth full season. The NCAA waived the JUCO rule for Aguilar and hundreds of other athletes in 2025.\n\nNo adequate remedy of law exists before a hearing can be had due to the time-sensitive nature of Plaintiff’s claim. Each day that passes leaves Aguilar unable to prepare and jeopardizes major career opportunities, lost time and opportunities that cannot be fully calculated or remedied with money damages.\n\nHeagerty is a well-respected chancellor who has served in that role since 2021. He received both his bachelor's and law degrees from University of Tennessee. He began teaching as an adjunct professor at the school’s Winston College of Law in the fall. All three Knox County chancellors have ties to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.\n\nSports reporter Adam Sparks contributed to this report.\n\nTyler Whetstone is an investigative reporter focused on accountability journalism.

My last training camp, dude, I went to bed in so much pain.\n\n\"I have a 3-year-old baby boy, and I want to use what I got left in my hips to play with his ass.\"\n\nJon Jones says he doesn't want to wrestle Daniel Cormier in RAF because he has 'severe arthritis'\n\n\"I have severe arthritis, and most people don't know that. My left hip is covered in arthritis... My last training camp, dude I went to bed in so much pain.\n\nI have a 3 year old… pic.twitter.com/NOp7i8xa5U\n\n— Championship Rounds (@ChampRDS) February 4, 2026\n\nOf course, the rivalry between Jones and Cormier is one of the fiercest in MMA history. Both men are multi-division UFC champions and among the most dominant fighters to ever compete. Jones and Cormier fought each other twice for the UFC light heavyweight championship, with Jones winning the first bout in 2015 by unanimous decision. They met again in 2017 in an infamous rematch that saw Jones initially win again by third-round knockout, only for the result to be overturned into a no-contest after Jones tested positive for banned substances — one of several failed drug tests in Jones' career.\n\nCormier retired in 2020 and entered into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2022, while Jones retired in 2025 but quickly reversed course on that decision in order to pursue a matchup against Alex Pereira at the UFC's upcoming White House event in June. The two rivals recently coached against one another on a season of \"ALF Global Reality,\" a Russian MMA program akin to \"The Ultimate Fighter,\" renewing tensions.\n\nJones dismissed Cormier as an \"a**hole and a d***head\" in an interview following the taping of the show, stating that Cormier \"made it very clear that he wants to be enemies for the rest of his life.\" In response, Cormier told Uncrowned's \"The Ariel Helwani Show\" that he does indeed have no desire to ever be friends with Jones, though he did express interest in meeting Jones in a trilogy match of sorts, either in the boxing ring or on the RAF wrestling mats.\n\n\"I don't know that he's willing to allow me to embarrass him in a wrestling match,\" Cormier told Uncrowned. \"I don't want to wrestle, [but] I would wrestle Jon Jones. ... If Jon Jones wants to wrestle, then yeah, I'll go wrestle Jon Jones. ... I'm not fighting [in MMA], man. No. Look at my face, dude — look at all this gray. I'm not fighting. I would box him, but I'm not fighting. Why not? I'd box his face up.\n\n\"Wrestling match would be preferable. [I beat him] 10-0, easy. Bro, I am an Olympian. We're going to get in a wrestling stance and wrestle with shoes on? 10-0 all day.\"\n\nAlas, it appears Jones vs. Cormier 3 won't be taking place in any venue anytime soon.",

    "fullText": "AC Milan’s ambitious pursuit of Dusan Vlahovic has hit a significant roadblock as the financial demands surrounding the Serbian striker begin to mount.\n\nAccording to Daniele Longo, the Rossoneri are struggling to make headway in a deal for the Juventus forward due to the exorbitant requests coming from his representation. Specifically, Vlahovic’s agent is demanding a commission worth €20 million to facilitate a transfer.\n\nWhile Milan’s sporting director Igli Tare maintains a positive relationship with the player’s entourage and has been in constant contact to explore a deal, these commission figures are making the move increasingly difficult from a financial perspective. The sheer scale of the auxiliary costs, on top of his salary, is testing the limits of Milan’s budget.\n\nDespite the current stalemate, the situation remains fluid because of the player’s firm stance in Turin. Vlahovic has already informed Milan that he has no intention of renewing his contract with Juventus. While his desire to seek a new challenge is clear, the €20 million hurdle currently stands between him and a potential move to the San Siro.",

The way he’s able to handle the basketball. He makes big shots when the shot clock’s running down.

But ultimately, she thought Miller was off-base.\n\n\"Knowing Reggie a little bit, I don't think he meant any harm by it,\" Cunningham told co-host West Wilson. \"But I do think (it was) probably not the best comparison for the generational player that Caitlin is,\" she continued with a smile on her face.\n\nReggie Miller’s comp for Caitlin Clark was… probably not the best choice possible pic.twitter.com/Yn8WhriTt6\n\n— Show Me Something (@ShowMe_Pod) February 3, 2026\n\nCunningham also believes that Clark was not offended by Miller's comment, despite online speculation to the contrary.\n\n\"I don't think she took it personal, I don't think anyone would really take it personal,\" Cunningham said. \"But I don't know if I would compare (Pritchard) to (Clark).\n\nAnd Clark herself poked some fun at the viral moment Tuesday night on X.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Heat seem to be a buyer at the deadline, with their top targets being Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Memphis Grizzlies superstar Ja Morant. However, it seems one of those stars may no longer be on the table for them.\n\nAccording to ClutchPoints’ Brett Siegel, the Heat are going to pivot from Antetokounmpo, and try to target someone else at the deadline.\n\nMORE: What the Anfernee Simons trade could mean for Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum's return\n\n“The Heat have been at the forefront of Giannis trade talks, yet too many questions surround their potential package, especially considering Tyler Herro's upcoming extension talks and the question of just how good their draft assets are. That is why Giannis no longer appears to be a possibility before Thursday, and it's also why league sources have indicated that Miami has already turned its attention to someone else,” Siegel wrote.\n\nSiegel then confirmed that the pivot will most likely be to Morant, as his value is much lower since the Grizzlies already traded Jaren Jackson Jr., so the Heat can finally get him for a bargain.\n\n“Ever since Morant became a focal point of trade conversations around the league near the start of the 2025-26 NBA season, all the intel surrounding him has been that he wants to find his way to Miami.The relationship between the Memphis Grizzlies and Morant cannot be repaired, and trust has been broken between him and the front office, sources said…For weeks, the Heat have been attempting to buy low on Morant, much like how the Washington Wizards did with their Trae Young trade with the Atlanta Hawks,” Siegel revealed.\n\nMORE: NBA insider surprisingly reveals surging Eastern Conference team as possible underdog suitor for Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo\n\nMorant would solve multiple issues in Miami, giving the Heat a true superstar to rally around, and a true playmaker to command their offense. He’d take the Heat from being a lower-seeded playoff team to a true contender.\n\nHopefully, the Heat get to work on making a deal before tomorrow, as many other teams might view Morant as a pivot as well.\n\nGrizzlies reveal position on franchise's future after blockbuster Jaren Jackson trade, inadvertently reveals Ja Morant's future with Memphis\n\nProposed blockbuster Nuggets trade sees Denver land $175 million two-time MVP, Finals MVP to create unstoppable duo with Nikola Jokic",

In fact, the F1 champion allegedly flew to Los Angeles with the reality TV star on her luxe private jet, worth $137 million.\n\nSince the dating speculations are gaining momentum, friends of Hamilton’s ex, Nicole Scherzinger, fear for Kardashian. It’s alleged that Hamilton and Scherzinger’s romance was “devastating,” with the F1 star leaving his ex in “tears” after a “nasty streak.”\n\nKim Kardashian has reportedly found love again, and this time, it’s with Lewis Hamilton. The rumored couple have reportedly been spending time together in various places, including the Cotswolds, London, and Paris.\n\nAs reported by The Sun, the British racing driver has known the Kardashians for years. He is also planning to reunite with them soon. In fact, it’s alleged that the couple even has the blessings of Kris Jenner as well. She reportedly believes it’s a good match.\n\nHowever, there are a few people who believe that he may not be the right choice for Kim Kardashian. Reportedly, Hamilton was previously in a long-term, eight-year relationship with Nicole Scherzinger. The singer’s friends believe that he is a “master of blowing hot and cold.”\n\nA friend of the former “X Factor” judge claimed that he would buy her gifts one moment and shower her with love. However, the next moment, he would allegedly cause an “enormous argument” and “ignore her for days.”\n\nThe friend said that “Nicole was a saint” for putting up with him for such a long time. The source claimed that after the breakup, Scherzinger stayed strong. However, she was left “devastated.” At the same time, Hamilton reportedly made a statement that he was “stronger than ever.”\n\n“That was typical Lewis. She could never understand how he could be so flippant about the years they had spent together,” said the friend. They further claimed that the experience was “devastating for her.” Now that Lewis Hamilton is allegedly with Kim Kardashian, his ex’s friends fear that the same might happen to the reality TV star.\n\nOriginally reported by Chhavi Puri on RealityTea.\n\nThe post Lewis Hamilton Had ‘Nasty Streak’ With Ex, Says Source Amid Kim Kardashian Rumors appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "description": "Hamlin had a tumultuous conclusion to 2025.",
    "fullText": "Denny Hamlin is going to race injured in 2026.\n\nHamlin, 45, told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium that he re-injured his right shoulder but will put off surgery until after the season because of the lengthy recovery timeline. Hamlin had surgery on his right rotator cuff after the 2023 season and dealt with the injury in the latter weeks of that season.\n\nHe said that he found out the muscle in his shoulder was re-torn after he fell going through debris at his parents’ house. Hamlin’s father Dennis died from injuries sustained in the fire on Dec. 28 in Stanley, North Carolina, and his mother, Mary Lou, was seriously injured. Hamlin said Wednesday that his mother’s condition was improving.\n\nDennis Hamlin had been in declining health before the fire. Denny Hamlin had said during the 2025 playoffs that he believed that it was his dad’s last opportunity to see him win a championship.\n\n\"Denny Hamlin: \"The easy thing to say is, 'Poor me.' But I still have a fantastic life, a great family. A lot of people go through tragic tragedies. ... Everyone kind of has their times where they have to go through tough moments. And I think that those are really kind of…\n\n— Jordan Bianchi (@Jordan_Bianchi) February 4, 2026\n\nHamlin did not get that title despite dominating the final race of the season at Phoenix. He led 208 of the race’s 319 laps, but a late caution for William Byron’s tire failure set up a green-white-checkered finish and Hamlin’s team’s four-tire pit stop strategy backfired as Kyle Larson finished ahead of Hamlin for the title.\n\nIt was a tumultuous end to 2025 — to put it mildly — for Hamlin. His 23XI Racing team also settled its lawsuit with NASCAR in December over the sanctioning body's charter system. The settlement was a win for 23XI and Front Row Motorsports, the plaintiffs in the suit, as NASCAR relented on its previous stance and granted teams permanent charters.\n\nHamlin, who is arguably the best NASCAR driver to not win a title, finished fifth in 2023 as he dealt with his shoulder injury. A crash at Homestead effectively ended his hopes for a championship in the 34th race of that season.\n\nThis season, the title format will be much different. NASCAR has re-implemented the cumulative 10-race Chase after using a multi-round elimination format since 2014. The winner-take-all title race is gone, as the driver who has the most points at the end of the playoffs will win the title.",

    "description": "The Kansas City Chiefs have always been the biggest thorn in the Buffalo Bills’ path when it comes to the Super Bowl. In fact, Josh Allen has lost four different contests against Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs over the years.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs have always been the biggest thorn in the Buffalo Bills’ path when it comes to the Super Bowl. In fact, Josh Allen has lost four different contests against Patrick Mahomes in the playoffs over the years. That’s why, when those same Chiefs missed the playoffs this year, it should have been good news for the Bills’ locker room. Except it wasn’t.\n\nAccording to Allen, the team never focused on the Chiefs’ exclusion from the playoffs. It went against what many football fans were thinking at the time when Buffalo reached the postseason with a dominant run no less. Many believed that the absence of Mahomes was another significant advantage for the team.\n\n“That’s something that we don’t talk about in the locker room, really. We don’t really care so much about who else is in the playoffs with us, how to get there, or how to get it done. The short answer is we didn’t get it done this year. And that’s on us, that’s on me,” Allen saidduring his appearance on First Things First.\n\nIt’s surprising to hear, to say the least. After all, Allen has lost to Mahomes by one score in the playoffs three times. Last season, less than one yard decided the outcome of the game.\n\nLater on, Allen shed some light on his mentality going into this postseason.\n\n“We’re going to keep working tirelessly until we find a way to get there and get it done. I understand the people’s thoughts of you don’t have no Mahomes, no Lamar, no Joe Burrow in the playoffs. But there’s some dang good teams in this playoffs. They’re not there just by chance. They’re there for a reason. And the two teams that are in the Super Bowl, they deserve to be there,” Allen stated.\n\nSome may see it as an excuse from the former MVP, but Allen is right. There were a few teams better than the Chiefs in the AFC this season. Even the Jacksonville Jaguars went on a run, giving the Bills a tough test in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe Denver Broncos ultimately ended up being the team to send Allen home this time around. They had an elite defense and were playing with home-field advantage. Allen turned the ball over four times in that game, including a pivotal overtime interception. It went down as another heartbreaking playoff loss in Bills history.\n\nMaybe one of these years, Allen and the Bills will get over the hump. At this point in his career, a Super Bowl win is a massive monkey the QB can’t seem to get off his back. It does, however, sound like he will always stay motivated to win one because of his love for the game. Still, the lack of a Lombardi Trophy in his hands must be starting to wear on him.\n\nThe post Bills News: Josh Allen Says Locker Room ‘Didn’t Really Care’ About Chiefs Missing the Playoffs appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "The \"Today\" anchor stepped away from Milano Cortina coverage as her 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, remains missing",
    "fullText": "Sports commentator and former tennis player Mary Carillo will replace Savannah Guthrie as co-host of the NBC’s Opening Ceremony for the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games after the “Today” host pulled out, following her mother’s disappearance.\n\nGuthrie had been originally scheduled to host the Opening Ceremony with Terry Gannon, who will remain on. Ahmed Fareed will now host “Olympic Late Night” from Feb. 7 to 9, replacing Craig Melvin.\n\nMelvin will remain stateside rather than traveling to Milan for the Games.\n\n“Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family. They continue to have our full support,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production. “We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talented commentators who will step in and fill these roles.”\n\n“Mary is one of the most experienced Olympic commentators ever and a master storyteller,” she added. “She and Terry will lead the American audience through one of the world’s greatest global moments. With his skill and versatility, Ahmed has proven time and again he can step into any hosting role, and we’re thrilled he’s available to handle our late night coverage before heading to Los Angeles for NBA All-Star Weekend.”\n\nThe Milan Games will be Carillo’s 17th Olympics that she has covered — she was already scheduled to be a correspondent in Milan. Of Italian descent herself, the commentator has a personal connection with the host city. This year will be her 14th Olympic assignment with NBC.\n\nAs previously announced, Shaun White will join the Opening Ceremony commentators in the booth during the Parade of Athletes. Following her Opening Ceremony duties, Carillo will cover the Games as a SportsDesk reporter.\n\nGuthrie’s 84-year-old mother Nancy has been missing since late Saturday night. The case has escalated from a missing-person to a suspected abduction with authorities saying they found signs of forced entry in her Arizona home.\n\nLive coverage of the Opening Ceremony begins Friday, Feb. 6, at 2 p.m. ET, with primetime coverage scheduled for 8 p.m. ET/PT on both NBC and Peacock.\n\nThe post NBC Sports Taps Mary Carillo to Fill In for Savannah Guthrie at Winter Olympics appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Nakobe Dean's re-signing would be a no-brainer if a recent market value projection proves an accurate guess.",
    "fullText": "A crap shoot, an inexact science. For all of the time and energy that Philadelphia Eagles coaches and scouts put into player evaluations, that's how the NFL Draft is described. Simply put, regardless of how hard these guys work to dissect these NCAA prospects, there are no guarantees about what they will or won't become at the next level.\n\nTake Nakobe Dean, for example. He's one of the better recent examples of that. His final year with the Georgia Bulldogs was the stuff of legend. We saw him blitz and make plays in the open field. Heck, we saw him intercept a pass while covering a guy in the slot once.\n\nWhen his final season ended at UGA, he had won the Butkus Award and been named a Unanimous All-American. Oh, and by the way, he was part of a College Football Playoff National Championship-winning roster.\n\nThe NFL Draft came. Surely he'd be a first-round draftee. That's what we thought. He was invited to Las Vegas as one of the sure-fire first-round prospects. That's when adversity came. He slid to Round 3, and Philadelphia made him the 83rd-overall selection.\n\nThere were rumors of a concealed injury, the likely reason he wasn't taken as high as some thought he should have gone. His first year at football's highest level was spent largely with him playing on special teams.\n\nYear two ended with a trip to the Eagles' injured reserve. In year three, he took on an expanded role and played well, but he again landed on the IR. Year four was again a contract season. He again missed time due to injury. That brings questions as we are knee-deep into another offseason. The most obvious one is as follows.\n\nSpotrac shared his market value recently. They see a four-year deal worth $31,599,724 as being fair. That's an annual salary of $7,899,931. This deal would rank 326th among active players. Here are two questions.\n\nFirst, would Philadelphia be willing to keep him around for that price? Second, would that interfere with their ability to sign needed defensive talent later on? One has to hope that the answers to those questions are 'yes' and 'no'. A record-breaking salary cap figure is projected for the coming 2026 NFL season.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, the Eagles have an embarrassment of riches at the linebacker position. Zack Baun is as good a player as comes at the position. Philadelphia has Jeremiah Trotter Jr., Jihaad Campbell, and Smael Mondon all waiting in the wings.\n\nThat said, one could understand why Philadelphia would keep Dean around or let him walk. We'll see what happens, especially since they have to make other decisions about contributors, namely Dallas Goedert and Reed Blankenship.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Nakobe Dean's projected price tag could make re-signing a no-brainer",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LX is set for Feb. 8, when the Lombardi Trophy winner for the 2025–26 season will be decided in a showdown between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe halftime show will take place as the teams head to the locker room, with music star Bad Bunny stepping in to deliver a performance sure to grab plenty of attention.\n\nReactions to the NFL halftime show are split. Some fans have gone so far as to say they will boycott the performance, while others are perfectly fine with the global music star taking the stage.\n\nMORE: Bad Bunny’s new Super Bowl 2026 trailer sends clear message ahead of halftime show\n\nKevin Durant, however, falls into a different category altogether. The longtime NBA veteran recently spoke candidly about Bad Bunny and his music, offering a personal perspective as the Super Bowl LX halftime show approaches.\n\nDurant appeared on Kay Adams’ Up and Adams podcast on Wednesday, where he shared that he has not listened to any of Bad Bunny’s songs. When the former NFL Network reporter asked Durant, “I want to know how you’re doing?” he replied, “Doing better. We’ll see in the morning.” Later, when Adams said, “Well enough to like to dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?” Durant simply confessed, “I haven’t listened to Bad Bunny before.”\n\nKay Adams: \"I want to know how you're doing?\"\n\nKevin Durant: \"Doing better. We'll see in the morning.\"\n\nKay: \"Well enough to like dance to Bad Bunny, [Super Bowl] halftime?\"\n\nKD: \"I haven't listened to Bad Bunny before.\"\n\n(via @UpAndAdamsShow)pic.twitter.com/d6mXJcmwqv\n\n— ClutchPoints (@ClutchPoints) February 4, 2026\n\nThe Puerto Rican star became famous with songs like ‘Soy Peor’ (1.1 billion views on YouTube), ‘Mía’, and ‘Dákiti’. His albums, including ‘YHLQMDLG’, ‘El Último Tour del Mundo’, and ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’, were huge hits. His ‘Un Verano Sin Ti’ especially made history because a Spanish-language album became one of the most popular in the United States and worldwide.\n\nBut some NFL fans are unhappy about Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. He has been outspoken on social and political issues, especially about U.S. immigration policies and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\n\nHe made a high-profile speech at the 2026 Grammys condemning ICE actions and calling for empathy toward immigrants, which upset many conservative viewers. These critics see him as too political and say his views don’t fit a traditionally neutral sports event.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo’s mom hints at next NBA team\n\nMLB: Mets sign former Dodgers World Series champion\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: Mattress Mack reveals massive $2 million Super Bowl 60 wager\n\nENTERTAINMENT: WWE star calls Pat McAfee to reveal shocking 2026 Royal Rumble return\n\nVIRAL: Kendall Jenner halts interview for Tom Brady Super Bowl 60 prediction on FaceTime\n\nThe post Kevin Durant stuns NFL world with honest Bad Bunny confession ahead of Super Bowl halftime show appeared first on The Big Lead.",

However, that's not where Green is expected to end up if the deal goes through.\n\nAccording to Windhorst (via RealGM), Green would want to be routed to a third team, and the Los Angeles Lakers are his preferred choice, with mutual interest on both sides.

Senger was on the Cardinals staff last year under head coach Jonathan Gannon, now Green Bay's defensive coordinator.\n\nEast OC Connor Senger on attention to detail and execution through the first few days of practice. pic.twitter.com/e2VwPBqedN\n\n— East-West Shrine Bowl (@ShrineBowl) January 25, 2026\n\nThen, Ian Rapoport, also of the NFL Network, posted Feb. 3 that the Chicago Bears have requested permission to speak with Senger, 30, about the team's offensive coordinator spot. Chicago is in the market after Declan Doyle left to become the Baltimore Ravens' offensive coordinator.\n\nSenger's roots in Wisconsin football run deep.\n\nHe's from West Allis, played quarterback at Pius XI High School, then walked on at Wisconsin before the 2013 season. After staying two years, he went to UW-Oshkosh, where he played in 11 games over two seasons.\n\nHe immediately got into coaching, first overseeing quarterbacks at Oshkosh, then the same position at Carroll University, then running backs at UW-Whitewater before becoming an offensive quality control coordinator in 2020 at North Dakota State – a team that happened to have current Packers receiver Christian Watson on the roster at the time.\n\nSenger began coaching with the Cardinals as a quarterback assistant in 2022, working his way up to passing-game specialist in 2025. He's also done work with college all-star games, serving as an assistant in the East-West Shrine Game this year for the second straight season, plus some work at the Senior Bowl in 2024.\n\nSenger has also interviewed for the Buffalo Bills quarterback job; that staff features new defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard, who became Wisconsin's defensive backs coach one year after Senger left UW. The Eagles also are reportedly interested in talking with him about their quarterbacks coach position.\n\nThe Packers already added one Wisconsin native to the staff this offseason from Arizona with the hiring of Oconomowoc High School and University of Wisconsin-La Crosse alumnus Sam Siefkes as linebackers coach.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Ex-Wisconsin QB Connor Senger gets look as Packers QB coach, Bears OC",

    "fullText": "Blue Jays Gold Glove free agent asked to change positions in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays have seen a few key players leave in free agency this offseason, with Bo Bichette being the most notable one, as he signed a $126 million deal with the New York Mets.\n\nBut, as part of his free agency, he had to switch positions. He's no longer a shortstop, but instead will play third base. He also drew free agent interest as a second baseman. To land a better deal, Bichette had to compromise and switch his position.\n\nOddly enough, another Blue Jays free agent is also in a similar situation. According to Katie Woo and Will Sammon of The Athletic, Blue Jays' free agent Ty France might also be changing positions to land a new deal, despite being a Gold Glove winner.\n\n\"Ty France could expand to second base,\" Woo and Sammon report. \"A couple of teams have asked the free agent first baseman about playing some second base, league sources said.\"\n\nMoving France, a Gold Glove award winner from the 2025 season, off of first base would be an odd decision, to say the least.\n\nBut Woo and Sammon clarified that, while teams would want France to play some second base, it wouldn't be as a full-time option. \"Those same clubs primarily see France as a first baseman.\"\n\nWhile there might be some teams interested in signing France to a free agent deal with the appeal of France playing some second base, they aren't going to completely change his position.\n\nMore: MLB Hot Stove tracker: Live updates on news, rumors, signings and trades for 2025 free agency\n\nFrance's Gold Glove defense at first base is worth a lot, and not something a team would willingly give up on if they signed him.\n\nThese teams just want the flexibility to move France around the infield, which he has experience with, if necessary.\n\nThe 31-year-old free agent infielder had a .277 batting average and a .693 OPS in 37 games for the Blue Jays in 2025 after being acquired from the Minnesota Twins.\n\nFrance's market hasn't been as robust as other free agents, but now, late in the offseason, his market is heating up. France won't be switching positions like Bichette, but teams do want the veteran free agent to increase his versatility before signing him.\n\nRed Sox make big $15 million mistake with Eugenio Suarez Reds news\n\nPirates' stance on trading Paul Skenes called into question by The Athletic\n\nRed Sox busy offseason now includes a whopping 9 trades\n\nMets face 2 key questions after offseason of change\n\nReds reunite with 49-homer slugger at major discount with $15 million free agent news\n\nYankees reveal plans for power prospect Spencer Jones\n\nOrioles trade for 23-year old third baseman from AL foe",

    "fullText": "It's officially Super Bowl Week, and that means the PGA Tour will make its annual trip to TPC Scottsdale for the Waste Management Phoenix Open.\n\nTwo-time champion Scottie Scheffler is well above the rest of the field in our Waste Management Phoenix Open odds. We break down his chances below.\n\nIt's no shock to see Scottie Scheffler listed as a short +230 favorite, especially after he won by four shots at the Amex in what was his first worldwide in nearly two months.\n\nHe's now won seven of his last 14 starts dating back to last May, and he hasn't finished outside of the Top 10 since THE PLAYERS in March. He also won this event in 2022 (closed +2500) and 2023 (+1200).\n\nBeyond the World No. 1 is a slew of options in the +2000 to +3000 range. That list starts with Xander Schauffele, but he just missed the cut at Torrey Pines in what was his season debut.\n\nBen Griffin, Cam Young, and two-time champ Hideki Matsuyama are in that group, too. Hideki has the best form of the three, having won the Hero World Challenge back in December and finishing T13 and T11 to kick off his 2026 season.\n\nBrooks Koepka is also a two-time winner (2015, 2021) and is on the board at +4000 after finishing T56 in his return to the PGA Tour last week.\n\nLet's take a look at some recent Waste Management Phoenix Open winners and their closing odds to win:\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has been urged to be “more careful with his future language” by representatives of the city’s Jewish community following his public comments regarding Israel’s military operations in Gaza.\n\nGuardiola delivered a speech in his home city of Barcelona last week, expressing support for Palestinian children at a charity event.\n\nOn Tuesday, he told journalists at a press conference that the suffering of innocent people caught in conflicts, including the ongoing situation in the Middle East, “hurts” him and compels him to speak out.\n\nHowever, the Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester & Region has advised Guardiola to “focus on football”, expressing concerns that such remarks could fuel antisemitic acts.\n\nThe group also accused him of a “total failure” to display solidarity with Manchester’s Jewish community in the wake of last October’s attack on the Heaton Park Synagogue, which claimed two lives.\n\n“We have repeatedly asked for prominent individuals to be mindful about the words they use given how Jewish people have had to endure attacks across the globe,” a statement posted on X read.\n\n“Pep Guardiola is a football manager. Whilst his humanitarian reflections may be well-intentioned, he should focus on football.\n\n“Manchester City is being let down by him repeatedly straying into commentary on international affairs. This is the second time in a week he has decided to offer his controversial views on the Middle East conflict.\n\n“It’s especially galling given his total failure to use his significant platform to display any solidarity with the Jewish community subjected to a terrorist attack a few miles from the Etihad Stadium or the Barcelona community reeling from antisemitic violence close to where he once engaged in remarks we believe to be provocative.\n\n“We implore Mr Guardiola to be more careful in his future language given the significant risk faced by our community.”\n\nCity have been contacted for comment regarding the JRC statement.\n\nGuardiola said on Tuesday: “Never, ever in the history of humanity have we had the info in front of our eyes, watching more clearly than now – genocide in Palestine, what happened in Ukraine, what happened in Russia, what happened all around the world, in Sudan, everywhere.\n\n“What happened in front of us? Do you want to see it? It’s our problems as human beings.\n\n“There is somebody who sees the images from all around the world who is not affected?\n\n“Today we can see it. Before we could not see it. Today we see. It hurts me.\n\n“If it was the opposite side, it would hurt me. Wanting harm for another country? It hurts me. (To) completely kill thousands of innocent people, it hurts me. It’s no more complicated than that. No more.\n\n“When you have an idea and you need to defend (it) and you have to kill thousands, thousands of people – I’m sorry, I will stand up. Always I will be there, always.”",

    "fullText": "Michigan football went 9-4 in 2025 despite having a lot going on behind the scenes. The hope with new head coach Kyle Whittingham leading the charge is that the Wolverines won't just rebound, they'll thrive.\n\nBut given the schedule, it will be something of an uphill battle for the maize and blue.\n\nMichigan will play Ohio State, Oregon, Indiana, Penn State, Iowa, Oklahoma, and more in 2026, with the first two matchups mentioned being on the road. Even so, CBS Sports' Brad Crawford (who usually isn't effusive in praise for the maize and blue) is optimistic about Whittingham's first year in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn Crawford's too-early CFP 12-team projection, the Wolverines make the cut as the 10-seed, meaning that they would be 12th overall and face Texas Tech, with the winner of the game set to face Indiana.\n\nAn early season win over Oklahoma win come in clutch for first-year Michigan coach Kyle Whittingham, who has more assets with the Wolverines than he ever possessed at Utah. Whittingham often gets the most out of his roster, and with enhanced resources, he should quickly push Michigan back in the playoff conversation. In this scenario as the 10-seed, the Wolverines would become the playoff's second-ever three-loss team, but first to not reach their league title game to get in. The losses? Oregon, Indiana and Ohio State.\n\nHaving three losses in the 2026 season wouldn't be a surprise given the perceived strength of schedule. However, making it into the 12-team invitational without losing that third game in the Big Ten Championship Game would be a bit of a surprise, given that no one has made it in with a 9-3 record before.\n\nCould that equate to a successful season? Making the playoff but with losses to Ohio State, Oregon, and Indiana? Perhaps, but most likely not in Michigan fans' eyes. Even if the schedule is more daunting this year than last.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Wolverines Wire: CBS Sports projects Michigan football to 2026 College Football Playoff",

    "fullText": "LeBron James has offered a fascinating insight into how a legendary WWE heel turn helped shape one of the most controversial chapters of his NBA career.\n\nAfter all, the Los Angeles Lakers star explained that his time with the Miami Heat was influenced by an unlikely wrestling icon.\n\nJames’ decision to embrace the villain role after leaving Cleveland in 2010 transformed how fans viewed him, and he has since acknowledged that the reaction was not only anticipated but studied.\n\nSpeaking on a recent episode of the Mind the Game podcast, LeBron revealed that the late WWE legend Hulk Hogan played a key role in how he understood fame, backlash, and reinvention.\n\n“I grew up watching Hulk Hogan. At one point, Hulk Hogan was like America, as everyone loved him. What it means to be an American.\n\nThen one day, he went to N.W.O. and people couldn’t understand how he tagged up with the enemy,” James said.\n\nHe added: “They were like, ‘What is going on?’ Everybody just booed him. He went from wearing red and yellow to black and white.”\n\nHogan’s infamous switch from beloved hero to villain in the 1990s stunned wrestling fans and redefined his career.\n\nLeBron saw clear parallels when he joined forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, a move that instantly made him the league’s most polarising figure.\n\nLeBron explained that accepting the villain label was partly about understanding entertainment as much as competition.\n\n“One, we’re entertainers as well… Listen, we want to go out and have fun, smile and be happy because that’s what brings us joy,” James continued.\n\nHe concluded, stating: “But we can tap into the Joker role if y’all make us, now. We can get there too now, and still be able to perform at a high level.”\n\nDuring his Miami Heat years, James leaned into the boos, the black uniforms, and the perception that he was basketball’s ultimate antagonist.\n\nRather than fighting public sentiment, he channelled it. The result was one of the most dominant stretches of his career, with championships, MVPs, and a sharpened edge that defined a new version of LeBron.\n\nMuch like Hogan’s transformation elevated professional wrestling, LeBron’s embrace of the villain role reshaped the NBA’s modern era. It was controversial, deliberate, and ultimately successful.\n\nLeBron James sends message to Wesley Bryan while explaining his recent golf obsession\n\nDillon Brooks calls LeBron James NBA’s most overrated player to renew rivalry\n\nRich Paul claims LeBron James turned Cleveland into ‘Hollywood of the Midwest’",

    "fullText": "Swansea Council says it has been told that regional rugby in Swansea will not exist beyond the end of next season if a takeover of Cardiff by Ospreys' owners Y11 Sport & Media is successful.\n\nIn a statement after a meeting with Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and Ospreys officials, the council said it had issued a pre-action legal letter to the WRU and Y11, warning of legal action if the restructure of Welsh professional rugby was not paused.\n\nThe WRU wants to reduce the number of men's professional teams in Wales from four to three, which could be achieved by eliminating Ospreys as a top-tier side through a takeover process of Cardiff by Ospreys' owners Y11 Sport & Media.\n\nThe WRU said the Swansea Council statement was inaccurate, but confirmed it had received the pre-action legal letter.\n\nOspreys say \"no decisions have been made regarding Ospreys' future after the 2026-27 season, and no statements have been made by Lance Bradley [chief executive] or anyone else associated with Ospreys which contradict that.\"\n\nY11 have also been asked to comment.\n\nA public meeting to discuss the Ospreys' future was held on Wednesday evening hosted by Swansea Council, which included former Ospreys players like Alun Wyn Jones, James King, Andrew Bishop and Paul James and attended by hundreds of people.\n\nSwansea Council had said it would publish the minutes of the meeting, which took place on 22 January, but in its statement claimed they had not done so because the WRU, Y11, and Ospreys objected to it.\n\nThe meeting included officials from Swansea Council, the WRU chief executive Abi Tierney, and Ospreys chief executive Lance Bradley.\n\nIn a statement, the council listed a number of what it called \"key facts\" that it claims were said at the meeting.\n\nThe statement includes that the Ospreys chief executive Lance Bradley confirmed that there would not be a professional Ospreys team playing regional rugby after 2027 if the takeover of Cardiff by Y11 went through.\n\nIt is claimed that Mr Bradley also said a merger with Swansea RFC could follow, which would see a merged team competing in the semi professional Super Rygbi Cymru instead of the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nThe council statement said: \"Council representatives left the meeting with a clear understanding that the basis of the WRU's and Y11's proposals for the future, if the acquisition of Cardiff Rugby by Y11 is completed, was that the Ospreys would not continue as a professional regional team after 2026-27.\"\n\n\"The council expressed deep frustration that, despite extensive and recent discussions about the redevelopment of St Helen's, it had not been informed earlier of these proposals. This lack of transparency and engagement is wholly unacceptable.\"\n\nThe council claim that the WRU's restructuring proposals would breach UK competition law and has issued pre-action letters to the WRU and Y11 requesting that they pause their plans.\n\nThe WRU has proposed cutting one of its four men's professional sides - Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - to three.\n\nThe WRU has stated there will be one licence in Cardiff, one in the west and one in the east, with Llanelli-based Scarlets, and Dragons in Newport, expected to be handed those.\n\nOspreys fans ramp up protest against WRU and Y11\n\nWRU accused of 'malicious cultural vandalism'\n\nWelsh rugby crisis - Who, what, why and where next?\n\nOspreys will continue playing in the URC and Europe next season, but their future beyond the end of the 2026-27 campaign looks even \n\nThere has been ongoing uncertainty around what will happen with the £5m development St Helen's ground in Swansea, that was set to be the Ospreys' new home from the start of next season.\n\nSwansea Council, which is funding the project, said its legal action would be aimed at safeguarding the future of regional rugby in the city.\n\nIn its pre-action legal letter, Swansea Council said the decision to cut the number of regions was \"a restriction of competition and has not been carried out in a fair, transparent or non-discriminatory way.\"\n\nIt also said that the WRU's ownership of Cardiff created a \"clear conflict of interest.\"\n\nThe council has asked for a response to its pre-action letter by 13 February.\n\n\"Coming out of the meeting we were clear on what we were told, we felt the public had a right to understand what the conclusion of that meeting meant,\" said Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council told BBC Wales.\n\n\"We've respected parts of the meeting, but there are some clear themes around the fact the decisions seems to have been made to end regional rugby here in Swansea.\n\n\"We felt the public of Swansea deserved to know what the proposals were.\n\n\"There was not an agreement to all parts of the minutes between the Ospreys and the WRU.\n\n\"So we felt it better to put out a statement that was not challengeable in terms of legal aspects, rather focus on the main themes and conclusions, which are not in doubt.\n\n\"We're continuing to support the Ospreys, to continue seeing them play regional rugby here in Swansea, but that does mean having a legal challenge towards the WRU and Y11.\"\n\nWhen asked whether a legal challenge was the best use of public money, Stewart said: \"For our region here, there's in excess of £12m of direct impact to the economy, 20,000 people play rugby in Swansea every week.\"\n\n\"All of that is at risk so it is in the public interest, and as a public body we have to stand up for what's right.\n\n\"We will continue to fight on behalf of the people of Swansea.\"\n\nThe WRU said: \"We can confirm that we have received a pre-action letter from Swansea Council, alongside a public statement which is inaccurate in reference to a recent meeting we attended.\n\n\"As you will understand we will be taking our own advice and so cannot comment on this at this time.\n\n\"This WRU board has worked in good faith since it took office some two years ago to create a new way forward for Welsh rugby given the significant financial and performance issues we are all facing.\n\n\"We appreciate that these are difficult issues for everyone concerned, but we have conducted ourselves with future long term success in mind.\"\n\nOspreys say they noted the statement from Swansea Council regarding discussions on the future of regional rugby in Wales.\n\nThe Ospreys statement said: \"As has been stated previously, Ospreys continues to operate as a professional club and is focused on supporting its players, staff, and supporters while competing in the URC under existing agreements.\n\n\"No decisions have been made regarding Ospreys' future after the 2026-27 season, and no statements have been made by Lance Bradley or anyone else associated with Ospreys which contradict that.\n\n\"Given the sensitivity of these matters, and the fact that they involve multiple parties and ongoing discussions, it would be inappropriate for Ospreys Rugby to comment on interpretations of meetings, unfinalised proposals, or legal correspondence.\n\n\"Ospreys Rugby remains committed to constructive engagement with all stakeholders and will communicate directly and transparently when there is confirmed information to share.\"",

    "description": "Claude Code for fullstack development doesn't require complex workflows. Three essentials -— full-stack debugging visibility, LLM-friendly docs, and an opinionated framework -— are all you need.",
    "fullText": "There's a lot of hype around vibe coding with Claude Code.\n\nThe good news is that it's warranted. Claude Code can take care of some surprisingly complex coding tasks.\n\nThe bad news is that it's over-hyped, with claims of amazing apps being vibe coded in a couple hours, or complex workflows that use 10 parallel sub-agents running in a loop to replace the work of 5 software engineers.\n\nIf you're not already a Claude Code power user, all this hype can leave you questioning how to use it effectively. Am I missing out on productivity gains by not adopting this insane new workflow? Should I be using subagents, commands, skills, or MCP servers for my use case? If so, how?\n\nI was asking myself these exact questions, so I did a good few weeks of research and testing, and reached the following conclusion:\n\nWith just a few well-picked tools, and Claude Code's basic features, you have enough to \"vibe code\" great full-stack apps.\n\nWeird seeing all these complex LLM workflows and tools. Meanwhile I run one continuous Claude convo per project... I've never used a subagent. Never used MCP…\nAnd I have wildly good results ¯_(ツ)_/¯\n\n— Chris McCord, creator of the Phoenix framework\n\nWhile Claude Code's abilities are impressive, you quickly realize that there is a lot of feature overlap and stuff you just generally won't have to touch often if you get a few things right from the start. I'll explain what these are, and then go into more detail on each topic within this article.\n\n1. Provide it with full-stack debugging visibility\n\n2. Give Claude Code access to up-to-date, LLM-friendly documentation\n\n3. Use the right tech stack or framework\n\nWith this foundation, you'll be able to build and deploy fullstack apps easily by mostly using Claude Code's default workflows, and just a couple custom commands/skills (I also packed these ideas into a simple Claude Code plugin you can install and use, but I'll talk more about that later).\n\nThis approach works because it provides guardrails and the right patterns for the agent to follow, so you can spend more time on business logic implementation, and less time working out specifications and technical details.\n\nEssentially, you get to work with the agent on what you want, rather than having to explain how you want it, bringing that magic feeling of AI-assisted coding to complex, full-stack apps.\n\nOur typical AI-assisted coding workflow tends to look like this: we prompt, then wait, then look over the generated code (maybe), then check on things in the browser. If we've got some errors or some bad looking frontend designs, we copy and paste them and try to (better) explain what we want.\n\nWhat's worse is we might have to do this a few times before we're satisfied, or get things working again.\n\nBut to do this, we need to give Claude Code a \"set of eyes\". Luckily, this is possible with the right features and tools, allowing it to see the results of the code it wrote, and quickly modify it autonomously if it encounters an error anywhere in the stack.\n\nClaude Code introduced their background tasks feature which lets it execute long-running tasks, like app development servers (e.g. npm run dev), on the side without blocking Claude's progress on other work. The nice part is that Claude can continue to read and respond to the output of this task while you work.\n\nTo run commands in the background, you can either:\n\nEven though Claude can read the output of your background tasks, there are times you may want to check up on them yourself, and you still can do that. Just use the down arrow to highlight the background task message and click enter.\n\nThis is great because now Claude can react to issues that occur from building and serving your code. Unfortunately, it still can't react to errors that occur while your app is running in the browser.\n\nBut there's a cool way to solve this.\n\nThe missing piece so far is giving Claude the ability to actually see the result of the code it wrote, most typically what the UI looks like.\n\nProblems that only show up after the app is running in the browser, like design issues and runtime errors, aren't yet visible to the agent. So this tends to be where the human steps in to report back to: \"the button is misaligned\", \"there's a 404 error when trying to login\", \"the console says something about undefined\".\n\nBut luckily, we can arm Claude Code with browser automation tools to solve for this. These tools allow for programmatic control of the browser, like loading pages, clicking buttons, inspecting elements, reading console logs, and even taking screenshots.\n\nThis closes the loop for the entire stack and gives Claude the autonomy to complete larger features tasks entirely on its own.\n\nChrome DevTools MCP server is one of the best options currently out there, though there are many alternatives. It's easy to install, and specializes in browser debugging and performance insights.\n\nTo install it, run the following command in the terminal to add it to your current project:\n\nThen start a new Claude session and give it a prompt like:\n\nYou should see a separate Chrome instance open up being controlled by Claude. Go ahead and give it more tasks like:\n\nNow, when you're implementing full-stack features in your app, ask Claude to verify the feature works correctly by checking the logs in the development server, as well as in the browser with the Chrome DevTools MCP.\n\nAlternatively, if you want Claude to always automatically verify changes in the browser with the DevTools MCP without having to explicitly ask it to do so, you can add a rule to Claude's memory in your CLAUDE.md file.\n\nYou've probably experienced this: you're vibe coding using a library's API, and the AI confidently writes code that would have worked perfectly… two versions ago. Or it creates some crazy, over-engineered work-around to a known issue that has a simple solution in its documentation.\n\nThis is because the model's training data has a cut-off date. LLMs and tools like Claude have no way of knowing about the updated code patterns, unless you give it access to the current documentation.\n\nBut, as Andrej Karpathy observed, most documentation contains content that's not relevant for LLMs:\n\n99% of libraries still have docs that basically render to some pretty .html static pages assuming a human will click through them. In 2025 the docs should be a your_project.md text file that is intended to go into the context window of an LLM.\n\nThere's research to back up his claim, showing that LLM performance degrades when irrelevant content, like HTML syntax or verbose instructions for humans, is added to context as it distracts from the task and reduces accuracy.\n\nIn other words, every unnecessary token in your context window makes the AI slightly worse at its job.\n\nSo we need to be giving Claude Code the right kind of docs.\n\nThe fix is simple: give the agent the ability to fetch and read the relevant, LLM-optimized documentation for the tools you're using.\n\nHere are the two main ways developers are accomplishing this:\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI applications (i.e. agents, LLMs) to external systems. Claude Code can communicate with an MCP server to access specialized tools and information.\n\nThere are already tons of MCP servers for popular tools, like Supabase, Jira, Canva, Notion, and Vercel. Claude Code has a docs section listing these and many more, with instructions on how to install them if you’re interested.\n\nDeveloper Tool MCP servers like Supabase and Vercel have tools which will fetch documentation for the agent based on a query. There are some pros and cons to this approach, though.\n\nBecause LLMs don’t have a real memory, they have to load information into context with every new session, such as the tools they can use. A single MCP server can add around 15-30 tools to the context, and with multiple servers you can easily consume 10-20% or more of your LLM’s context window before you even begin working.\n\nIf you want to see how much of your context window is already used up, you can run the /context slash command in an active Claude Code session.\nThe example above shows that 2.5% of the context window is used up by just one MCP server.\n\nAnd as an LLM’s context window fills up, it’s performance degrades. Some devs even suggest starting a new session once the context is 75% full to avoid this, which is possible with the /clear command in Claude Code. You can also run the /compact command which creates a summary of your current session’s context and passes it along to the next session.\n\nLuckily, if your main reason for using an MCP server is just for documentation searching, then an alternative open standard exists that may be a better fit.\n\nLLMs.txt has quickly become the standard for providing LLMs with context-friendly versions of websites at an /llms.txt path.\n\nTry it out on some of your favorite developer tools URLs, such as:\n\nAlthough llms.txt files might vary widely in the content they surface, they always follow the same format of a simple markdown file with the title of the website and some links. That’s it! This allows LLMs to get precise information without all the fluff.\n\nHere are some of the pros and cons of using llms.txt for documentation fetching:\n\nIn my opinion, I think that fetching docs via an llms.txt URL is the better approach as its more context efficient. For example, a typical documentation file is ~100 tokens versus 5,000-10,000 tokens for just one MCP server.\n\nThat’s a 10x reduction in context usage.\n\nClaude Code is also great at navigating documentation maps to only fetch the most relevant information. Plus, you get the added benefit that llms.txt files are easier for humans to reference as well.\n\nIt's also the method that Claude Code uses for its own doc fetching internally. So when you ask it a question about its own features, it will first fetch its documentation map markdown file URL to find the correct guides.\n\nSo now that you know how to give Claude Code access to up-to-date documenation, the next question to answer is which tools might you need to provide the docs for?\n\nAnd the most obvious answer is the tech stack or framework you’re building your full-stack app with.\n\nThis is probably the most overlooked of the 3 pillars.\n\nStarting with a tech stack that AI can easily reason about will make the job of building the app you want significantly easier. There are a lot of options out there, but luckily there are many solid choices, such as:\n\nIn 2026, you'll be able to get very far with Claude Code and any of the frameworks listed above. But while these frameworks all offer good conventions, and are responsible for stitching together the most important parts of the stack, most of these still require some sort of additional integration.\n\nFor NextJS, which is more client-side focused, you have to chose and connect your own database layer. For Laravel and Rails, which unify backend and database, you need to decide which client to use and how it will talk to your backend.\n\nThat's why a lot of developers will reach for popular stacks/combos that include these frameworks, such as:\n\nYou might have noticed as well that the T3 Stack is the only one to include an authentication library, NextAuth. That's because the backend-focused frameworks, Laravel and Rails, have an opinionated way of adding authentication to your app already, but NextJS does not.\n\nWasp, on the other hand, is the only one of the bunch that unifies all parts of the stack — client ↔ backend ↔ database — while also being opinionated on features.\n\nThis is all great, but which one should you ultimately choose?\n\nWell, the more opinionated the framework, the better it vibes with AI.\n\nIf a framework is opinionated, it means there's usually one obvious place to put code and one common pattern to follow. The AI doesn't have to guess. They've already made decisions ahead of time so you (and your agent) don't have to. They've encoded architectural wisdom into conventions, picked the libraries to use, the way authentication is wired, and how the app should be structured.\n\nSo when there are fewer decisions to make, less boilerplate to write, and fewer tools to stitch together, the development process becomes more reliable.\n\nAnd as the app gets more complex, AI doesn't lose its focus, because the framework is handling a lot of underlying complexity. You can also understand and inspect what is being generated more easily, and avoid building yourself into a messy corner.\n\nConsider that opinionated frameworks can reduce boilerplate by 60-80%. Wasp's auth declaration, for example, replaces 500+ lines of typical authentication code with a 10 to 15-line config. That's 97% less code that needs to be generated and audited!\n\nOf these frameworks, Wasp is definitely the most opinionated but it's also the newest kid on the block. After that, Laravel and Rails are probably tied for a close second, but they are built on PHP and Rails, respectively, and come with their own distinct ecosystems, so you'll most likely have to pair them with a frontend JavaScript framework like React, too. NextJS, is the most popular but least opinionated of the bunch, so it means there is more complexity and up-front choices you and your AI have to deal with, but this offers more flexibility in the long run.\n\nSo in the end, the choice you make largely depends on what you're trying to achieve, what you're comfortable with, and how much flexibility you need.\n\nJust remember, the more a framework gives you structure and defaults, the easier it is for AI to generate code that fits correctly — and the less time you spend fixing confusing or inconsistent output.\n\nOk. So we've established that working with an opinionated framework means that it it manages a lot of the complexity for you.\n\nBut what does that practically mean when using it with Claude Code?\n\nIn a sense, the framework acts as a large specification that both you and Claude already understand and agree on.\n\nInstead of multi-turn conversations to figure out HOW things should be built, you get to just say WHAT you want built.\n\nSo when you tell Claude \"add a new model for Comments\" or \"add a user account settings feature\", Claude will know exactly what that means and where it all goes. And you also get the added benefit that the implementations follow best practices and are backed by the decisions of experienced professionals behind the framework, and is not just some LLM hastily implementing a feature on the wrong assumptions.\n\nThis isn't to say that you no longer have to do good planning, create a good spec, or Product Requirement Doc for your agent to follow. This can still be a really important step when vibe coding (or practicing \"spec-driven development\").\n\nBut it does mean that, with an opinionated full-stack framework, much less of your planning phases need to be devoted to discussing architectural and technical implementation details.\n\nIf you want to put this theoretical approach I discussed above to the practical test, then I suggest you try out the Wasp plugin we created for Claude Code.\n\nWe, the Wasp framework creators, maintain the plugin, so we've battle tested it with Wasp. Plus we're a very responsive community and we're listening to feedback and improving it all the time.\n\nFrom there, you can tell Claude to \"start the dev server\" and it will walk you through spinning up fullstack visibility as we outlined above. Or ask it to implement a Wasp feature and watch it fetch version-matched documentation guides for you!\n\nMore importantly, Wasp as a framework pushes into territory that's even more AI-native than the rest, because of its central configuration file(s) where the app is defined.\n\nThis main config file is like your app's blueprint. Wasp takes these declarations, and manages the code for those features for you.\n\nTake this example config file authentication snippet as reference:\n\nThis is what an authentication implementation in Wasp looks like. That's it.\n\nThis 8-line config generates what would typically require 500-800 lines of code: components, session handling, password hashing, OAuth flows, and database schemas. Claude just needs to know what auth methods you want.\n\nClaude doesn't need to worry about choosing what kind of auth implementation to use, or generating any of the glue code. It can just get straight to work building features.\n\nI've spent this whole article arguing that you can ignore a lot Claude Code features for fullstack app development. But I don't want to leave you with the impression that those features are useless.\n\nCustom subagents, commands, and skills shine when you're doing the same task repeatedly with consistent criteria, e.g.:\n\nThese are tasks where you want the same process followed every time and where a well-configured subagent with specific rules makes sense.\n\nIn most cases, reach for complexity only when the simpler approach stops working.\n\nWith these three ingredients I think most fullstack app developers can get the vast majority of the work done without reaching for much more:\n\nWith these in place, Claude Code's basic toolset—exploring, planning, reading, writing, running commands—is enough to build real, complex fullstack applications. The subagents, hooks, plugins, and complex configurations are there if you need them, but honestly most of the time, you won't.",

    "fullText": "Imagine trying to teach someone to cook over the phone.\n\nYou’re walking them through your grandmother’s pasta recipe—the one with the garlic that needs to be just golden, not brown. You describe every step perfectly. The timing. The technique. The little flip of the wrist when you toss the noodles.\n\nAnd then they say: “It’s burning. What do I do?”\n\nHere’s the thing: you can’t help them. Not really. Because you can’t see the pan. You can’t see how high the flame is. You can’t see that they accidentally grabbed the chili flakes instead of oregano. All you have is their panicked description and your best guess about what might be going wrong.\n\nThis, my friend, is exactly what happens when you ask Claude Code to fix a bug.\n\nYou’ve been on this ride before. I know you have.\n\nYou describe the bug to Claude. Carefully. Thoroughly. You even add screenshots and error messages because you’re a good communicator, dammit.\n\nSo you describe the bug again—this time with more adjectives and maybe a few capitalized words for emphasis. Claude proposes a slightly different fix. Still broken. You rephrase. Claude tries another angle. Round and round we go.\n\nThis is the debugging merry-go-round, and nobody buys tickets to this ride on purpose.\n\nThe instinct—the very human instinct—is to blame the AI.\n\nThat’s actually the right question.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned after spending more time than I’d like to admit arguing with AI about bugs: Claude almost never fails because it lacks intelligence. It fails because it lacks visibility.\n\nThink about what you have access to when you’re debugging. Browser dev tools. Console logs scrolling in real-time. Network requests you can inspect. Elements that highlight when you hover. The actual, living, breathing behavior playing out on your screen.\n\nYou’re asking a brilliant chef to fix your burning pasta—but they can only read the recipe card. They can’t see the flame. They can’t smell the smoke. They’re working with incomplete information and filling in the gaps with educated guesses.\n\nSometimes those guesses are right. (Claude is genuinely brilliant at guessing.)\n\nMost of the time? Merry-go-round.\n\nAfter countless Claude Code debugging sessions—some triumphant, many humbling—I’ve noticed two categories that consistently send AI spinning:\n\nReact’s useEffect dependencies.\n\nRace conditions. Stale closures. Data that shapeshifts mid-lifecycle like some kind of JavaScript werewolf. These bugs are invisible in the code itself. You can stare at the component for hours (ask me how I know) and see nothing wrong. The bug only reveals itself at runtime—in the sequence of events, the timing of updates, the order of renders.\n\nIt’s happening in dimensions Claude can’t perceive.\n\nCSS being overridden by inline JavaScript. WordPress functions receiving unexpected null values from somewhere upstream. Error messages that point to line 7374 of a core file—not your code, but code three function calls removed from the actual problem.\n\nBut the source? Hidden in cascading calls, plugin interactions, systems talking to systems.\n\nClaude can’t solve either category by reading code alone.\n\n(I told you to stay with me. Here’s where it gets good.)\n\nLet me walk you through a real example.\n\nBecause theory is nice, but showing you what this looks like in practice? That’s the good stuff.\n\nI had a Products Browser component. Simple filtering and search functionality—the kind of thing you build in an afternoon and then spend three days debugging because life is like that sometimes.\n\nEach control worked beautifully in isolation:\n\nSearch for “apple” → Three results. Beautiful.\n\nFilter by “laptops” → Five results. Chef’s kiss.\n\nSearch “apple” + category “laptops” → Broken. The filter gets completely ignored, like I never selected it at all.\n\nClassic React hook dependency bug.\n\nIf you’re experienced with React, you spot this pattern in your sleep. But if you’re newer to the framework—or if you vibe-coded this component and touched a dozen files before realizing something broke—you’re stuck waiting for Claude to get lucky.\n\nI spent three rounds asking Claude to fix it. Each fix addressed a different theoretical cause. None worked.\n\nThat’s when I stopped arguing and started instrumenting.\n\nInstead of another “please fix this” prompt, I asked Claude to help me see what was happening:\n\nNotice what I didn’t say: “Fix this bug.”\n\nWhat I said: “Add logging to track data changes.”\n\nThis is the mindset shift that changes everything.\n\nClaude added console.log statements to every useEffect that touched the view state:\n\nEach log captured which effect triggered, what the current values were, and what got computed. Basically, Claude created a running transcript of everything happening inside my component’s brain.\n\nI opened the browser, selected “laptops” from the category filter, then typed “apple” in the search box.\n\nThe console lit up like a Christmas tree of evidence.\n\nHere’s where the magic happens. I copied that console output—all of it—and pasted it directly into Claude:\n\nAnd Claude? Claude saw everything:\n\nClaude found the bug immediately.\n\nThe logs revealed the whole story: when I selected a category, useEffect:filters fired and correctly filtered the products. But then when I typed in the search box, useEffect:search fired—and it ran against the full product list, completely ignoring the category filter.\n\nThe search effect was overwriting the filter results.\n\nLast effect wins. (JavaScript, you beautiful chaos gremlin.)\n\nClaude proposed the fix: replace multiple competing useEffect hooks with a single useMemo that applies all transforms together:\n\nThe difference between “Claude guessing for 20 minutes” and “Claude solving it instantly” was 30 seconds of logging.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole. That’s just… math.\n\nThe second method works for a different beast entirely—the kind of bug where even the error message is lying to you.\n\nHere’s a WordPress error that haunted me for hours:\n\nIf you’ve done any WordPress development, you recognize this particular flavor of suffering.\n\nThe error points to core WordPress files—not your code. Something, somewhere, is passing null to a function that expects a string. But where? The error message is about as helpful as a fortune cookie that just says “bad things happened.”\n\nI’d made changes to several theme files.\n\nAny one of them could be the culprit.\n\nAnd the cascading nature of WordPress hooks meant the error could originate three or four function calls before the actual crash.\n\nAfter a few rounds of Claude trying random fixes (bless its heart), I tried something completely different.\n\nInstead of “fix this,” I asked Claude to brainstorm debugging approaches—and to visualize them with ASCII diagrams.\n\n(I know. ASCII diagrams. In 2025. But stay with me, because this is where Claude Code debugging gets genuinely interesting.)\n\nClaude started by analyzing the flow of the problem:\n\nThe diagram showed exactly what was happening: some theme code was passing null to WordPress core functions, which then passed that null to PHP string functions, which threw the deprecation warning.\n\nBut which theme code? Claude identified the suspect locations:\n\nEach with code examples showing what the problematic pattern might look like.\n\nThis is Claude thinking out loud, visually. And it’s incredibly useful for Claude Code debugging because now we’re not guessing—we’re investigating.\n\nRather than jumping to a single fix and hoping, Claude laid out several approaches:\n\nFour different angles of attack.\n\nThis is what systematic debugging looks like—and it’s exactly what you need when you’re stuck in the merry-go-round.\n\nHere’s where Opus 4.5 surprised me.\n\nInstead of settling on the first approach, it validated its theories by actually searching the codebase:\n\nIt searched for wp_redirect calls, add_filter patterns, get_option usages—systematically eliminating possibilities like a detective working through a suspect list.\n\nThen it updated its diagnosis based on what it found:\n\nThe error was coming from path-handling functions—something was returning a null path where a string was expected.\n\nClaude concluded with a clear summary of everything we now knew:\n\nAnd multiple approaches to fix it, ranked by how surgical they’d be:\n\nFirst attempt. Approach A—adding a debug backtrace—immediately revealed a function in FluentCartBridge.php that was returning null when $screen->id was empty.\n\nAll those rounds of failed attempts? They were doomed from the start because Claude was guessing blindly. Once it could see the error chain visually—once it had a map instead of just a destination—the solution was obvious.\n\nBoth of these methods work because they address the same fundamental gap in Claude Code debugging: AI doesn’t fail because it’s not smart enough. It fails because it can’t see what you see.\n\nWhen you’re debugging, you have browser dev tools, console logs, network requests, and actual behavior unfolding on your screen. Claude has code files.\n\nIt’s working with incomplete information and filling the gaps with educated guesses.\n\nHere’s the mindset shift that changed everything for me:\n\n👉 Stop expecting AI to figure it out. Start helping AI see what you see.\n\nYou become the eyes. AI becomes the analytical brain that processes patterns and proposes solutions based on the evidence you feed it.\n\nIt’s a collaboration. A partnership. Not a vending machine where you insert a problem and expect a solution to drop out.\n\nAdd logs when the bug involves:\n\nThe logs transform invisible runtime behavior into visible evidence.\n\nReact’s useEffect, state updates, and re-renders happen in milliseconds—too fast to trace mentally, but perfectly captured by console.log. Feed those logs to Claude, and suddenly it can see the movie instead of just reading the script.\n\nUse the brainstorming approach when:\n\nAsking Claude to brainstorm with diagrams forces it to slow down and map the problem systematically. It prevents the merry-go-round where AI keeps trying variations of the same failed approach. By exploring multiple angles first, you often find the root cause on the very first real attempt.\n\nHere’s what I want you to take away from all of this:\n\nDon’t argue with AI about what it can’t see. Show it.\n\nThe next time Claude can’t solve a bug after a few rounds, resist the urge to rephrase your complaint. Don’t add more adjectives. Don’t type in all caps. (I know. I KNOW. But still.)\n\nInstead, ask yourself: “What am I seeing that Claude isn’t?”\n\nThen find a way to bridge that gap—through logs, through diagrams, through screenshots, through any method that gives AI the visibility it needs to actually help you.\n\nThat bug that’s been driving you up the wall? The one Claude keeps missing?\n\nThen watch it solve what seemed impossible.\n\nYou’ve got this. And now Claude does too.\n\nFreelance web developer.

From CPS samples from 1994 to 1999, we find a group of parents at least 25 years old who have at least one coresident child aged 10–16 in the household. We then use CPS samples from 2010 to 2023 to identify children aged 25–31 who fit the same criteria, giving us 10 paired child-parent linkages for the regressions. Ages 10–16 are used to maximize the sample size while ensuring that they are young enough to be living with their parents in the starting year and old enough to have mostly completed their education 15 years later. Parent-child groups are separated by birthplace region. Then, for each region, the average education levels of children and parents are constructed and used to create the regression.\n\n36.

Costs of 2023 hotel shelters for illegal immigrants are subtracted from congestible spending and apportioned to noncitizens as new flows called shelter_​f and shelter_​s. State and local shelter costs total $3,960,786,402. This includes New York City (“Asylum Seeker Spending Report,” Office of the New York State Comptroller, June 30, 2025); Chicago (“Cost Dashboard,” Chica​go​.gov, August 8, 2025); Denver (Dillon Thomas, “Denver Has Spent More than $33M to Support Immigrants in the Last Year, More Aid Needed,” CBS News, December 5, 2023); Boston (Gabrielle Emanuel, “As Need for Emergency Shelters in Mass.

Although other places in the country have incurred some shelter costs, the overall nationwide costs outside of these areas are assumed to be no higher than the per capita average. Some cities, such as Miami, have policies prohibiting migrant shelter use. See: Douglas Hanks and Syra Ortiz-Blanes, “Homeless Chief Takes ‘Hard Line’ on Shelter for Migrants in Miami, Calls It Feds’ Job,” Miami Herald, January 13, 2023. This methodology is supported the fact that only states—Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado—accounted for the large majority of the increase in homelessness from 2023 to 2024. Federal shelter costs totaled $207,271,140 in 2023 (“FY23 Awards from the Shelter and Services Program,” FEMA​.gov, August 4, 2024). There is pre-pandemic (2012–2013) evidence that immigrants were significantly less likely to have experienced homelessness than the US-born population. J. Tsai and X.

CPS ASEC variable reporting property tax payment is not available post-2018. This is an important tax flow to track, so we attempt to provide plausible estimates for more recent data by assigning each individual the weighted average of property taxes paid by their age, immigrant generation, education level, and state of residence bucket using a three-year average from 2016 to 2018. Data for our aggregate controls for this flow are available for all years from 1994 to 2023, so the total amount of property taxes paid is tied to real data even though the individualized amounts are imputed.\n\n131.

To calculate the 10 percent effective federal income tax rate, we divide federal individual and corporate income tax revenues by total national income (see NIPA Tables 3.2 and 1.7.5). Naturally, the actual deductions would be at the average marginal rate (of about 20 percent), but before the 2017 tax reform, 70 percent of filers did not claim the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction, and SALT deduction use fell to just 9 percent after 2017. The pre-2017 reform federal income tax revenues were $100 billion lower in 2017 because of SALT, which is about 4 percent of state taxes, but there were also mortgage interest deduction and corporate income tax deductions. After the 2017 reform, the SALT deduction cost fell to less than 1 percent of state tax revenue.

    "fullText": "A sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA sign for the Washington Post is seen at the company’s offices, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Washington. \n\nThe Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going. But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n“It’s just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,” said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times. “The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nAs of midday, the Post did not have any news of the changes on its website.\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment Wednesday.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million. The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post’s coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country’s best feature writing.\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper’s Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.\n\nIn the immediate future, Murray said, the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump’s changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company’s structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to staff members. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn’t kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.”\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos’ support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president’s first term.\n\n“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post’s mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post’s success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”\n\nDavid Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

    "title": "User blowback convinces Adobe to keep supporting 30-year-old 2D animation app",
    "description": "Despite the about-face, some customers think \"the damage is done.\"",
    "fullText": "Adobe has canceled plans to discontinue its 2D animation software Animate.\n\nOn Monday, Adobe announced that it would stop allowing people to sell subscriptions to Animate on March 1, saying the software had “served its purpose.” People who already had a software license would be able to keep using Animate with technical support until March 1, 2027; businesses had until March 1, 2029. Per an email sent to customers, Adobe also said users would lose access to Animate files and project data on March 1, 2027. Animate costs $23 per month.\n\nAfter receiving backlash from animators and other users, Adobe reversed its decision on Tuesday night. In an announcement posted online, the San Jose, California-headquartered company said:\n\nWe are not discontinuing or removing access to Adobe Animate. Animate will continue to be available for both current and new customers, and we will ensure you continue to have access to your content. There is no longer a deadline or date by which Animate will no longer be available.\n\nAdobe said the software will be available for individuals and businesses and will still receive technical support and security and bug fixes, but not new features.\n\nThe company said its Monday announcement “did not meet our standards and caused a lot of confusion and angst.”\n\n“We are committed to ensuring Animate users have access to their content regardless if the state of development changes,” Adobe said.\n\nMike Chambers, a community director at Adobe, affirmed via Reddit that Adobe has no plans to shut down Animate. If the company decides to discontinue the software, it “will work closely with the community to ensure they have adequate time to plan in order to minimize disruption and will take steps so that the community continues to have long-term access to their content,” he said.\n\nAnimate debuted in 1996 as FutureWave Software’s FutureSplash Animator. After a 1997 acquisition by Macromedia, FutureSplash Animator became Macromedia Flash. In 2005, Adobe bought Macromedia and renamed Macromedia Flash to Adobe Flash Professional. In 2015, the software became Adobe Animate CC. In its nearly 30 years of use, Animate has been used in numerous popular animated films and shows, including Star Trek: Lower Decks. Still, Adobe said on Monday that “new platforms and paradigms have emerged that better serve the needs of the user.”\n\nBased on the response to Monday’s announcement, not everyone agrees that Animate is obsolete. Adobe’s announcement has also drawn increased scrutiny because of the company’s growing focus on AI-based tools, which have led to higher subscription fees.\n\n“Shutting down Animate and cutting off users from decades worth of work, while simultaneously focusing on anti-artist AI technology, is incredibly disrespectful to your users. Make the software open-source if you’re not going to do the work yourself,” a user on Adobe’s forum going by “FFFlay” wrote in response to Monday’s announcement.\n\nAlthough Adobe has shown an ability to respond to customer frustration and will allow people to use Animate for the foreseeable future, people who depend on the software, including for animation and education, are concerned about relying on a program that Adobe almost discontinued.\n\nIn a post today, an Adobe community member going by the username rayek.elfin wrote, “The damage is done in my opinion. The news of Adobe discontinuing Animate went viral and probably created so much anxiety and uncertainty that studios and indie animators are already looking to replace Animate in their pipelines.”\n\nWhen asked how Adobe will try to rebuild trust among users, Chambers said, “Trust doesn’t come beforehand, it comes after (and has to be earned). We say what we will do, and if we consistently do it, we gain trust. We are at the ‘we say what we will do’ part for a lot of people.”",

    "fullText": "Plugin and extension development for JetBrains products.\n\nStarting from version 2026.1, IntelliJ-based IDEs will run natively on Wayland in supported desktop configurations. This follows Wayland’s ascendance to the position of primary display server across contemporary Linux distributions.\n\nInstead of running as X applications, IntelliJ-based IDEs will now automatically enable native Wayland support in a Wayland-capable desktop environment.\n\nSince the last preview in 2024.2, we have enhanced stability across several Wayland server implementations, added drag-and-drop functionality and input methods (IMs) support, and made a significant step towards native-looking window decorations.\n\nWayland differs profoundly from X11 in several technical ways. As a result, even though the user interface should largely look and feel the same, these underlying distinctions may be noticeable:\n\nSome of these distinctions affect many Wayland users across other applications, and the Wayland community is actively addressing them. It is possible that they will be resolved in future versions of Wayland implementations and IntelliJ-based IDEs.\n\nIn a Linux desktop environment that does not support Wayland, IntelliJ-based IDEs will continue to work as X applications. It is also possible to switch to using X11 on any Wayland desktop because an X.Org implementation called XWayland is always available for compatibility with older applications. To do that, add -Dawt.toolkit.name=XToolkit to the VM options list (Help | Edit Custom VM Options…) and restart the IDE.\n\nIf you are curious about which mode your IntelliJ-based IDE is currently running in, you can find out by going to the About dialog (Help | About) and checking which toolkit is in use. Click on the Copy and Close button, and you’ll then see the toolkit’s name towards the top of the copied text:\n\nThis information is also available in idea.log; for example:\n\nINFO - #c.i.p.i.b.AppStarter - toolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\n\nWayland support for Remote Development mode is currently a work in progress. In the meantime, Remote Development mode will continue to operate as before and not enable native Wayland support automatically.\n\nNative Wayland support is mostly concentrated in one subsystem called WLToolkit. If you were one of the early adopters of this mode, you had to specify the -Dawt.toolkit.name=WLToolkit VM option manually. This will continue to work, but it is no longer necessary.\n\nThe launcher will supply a new option to the IDE: -Dawt.toolkit.name=auto. The “auto” option will be resolved into either WLToolkit or XToolkit based on the following rule:\n\nLike every other aspect of JetBrains Runtime, the platform that powers IntelliJ-based IDEs, WLToolkit is fully open-source. JetBrains is also a key contributor to the OpenJDK project Wakefield, which is dedicated to ensuring that all Java applications execute natively on Wayland. New features and fixes are regularly published to the project’s GitHub repository.\n\nWe are very grateful for the dedication and valuable input from our users who participated in the Wayland Preview program. The time and effort you invested in reporting issues were instrumental, not only in identifying critical bugs but also in helping us accurately prioritize the roadmap for improvements and the implementation of key features.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the upcoming version 2026.1 incorporates fixes for a substantial number of the reported problems. These fixes address a wide range of stability, performance, and desktop integration issues, marking a major milestone in the maturity of our Wayland support.\n\nThis major platform transition is a work in progress. We are actively investigating and developing fixes, prioritizing core areas like rendering, popups, window management, input methods (IMs), and desktop integration. Please Your patience and feedback are crucial as we work toward a stable, performant, modern, and feature-complete experience.\n\nCheck out the Q4 2025 highlights from JetBrains Marketplace – updates to the moderation process, the latest tooling improvements, and helpful learning resources for plugin developers.\n\nThe IntelliJ Platform provides a powerful debugger framework that plugins can extend to support various programming languages and runtime environments.

    "fullText": "Selling Chicago-style pizza outside of Chicago has always been a challenge.\n\nAs someone who grew up near Boston, a city with a grand tradition of thinner-crust pizza offered by chains such as Pizzeria Regina, Papa Gino's, and Santarpio's, deep-dish pizza seemed like an entirely different food. It wasn't something commonly sold during my childhood, and it remains something I've never really considered pizza.\n\nDespite that, Uno Pizzeria, which was known as Pizzeria Uno back in the 1980s and 90s, flourished in New England. The chain offered a version of deep-dish pizza that was a take on the Chicago classic, but also closer to traditional pizza.\n\nIt was deep-dish, but not quite as deep as what's traditionally sold under that name. You could eat it with a fork and knife, but you could also pick it up and eat it as a slice.\n\nUno did not exactly take over New England, but it became a steady presence with dozens of locations across the region. That presence has slowly withered, as the overall chain has shrunk from over 150 locations nationwide to only 36 as of Feb. 3, 2026, according to the locations page on the company's website.\n\nNow, the chain has suddenly closed three more Massachusetts locations.\n\nUno Pizzeria has closed locations in Dedham, Revere, and Braintree, Massachusetts, without any notification to customers, Boston's WCVB reported.\n\nThe chain posted a notice on its Facebook page, which has since been taken down.\n\n“After 34 years of serving this amazing community, our Revere location is closing its doors for the last time on Sunday,” the restaurant posted. “We would like to extend a massive thank you to everyone who has made this restaurant feel like home for over three decades. It’s been an unforgettable run!”\n\nTaco Bell and KFC work on simplifying their restaurants\n\nChick-fil-A making major change to 425 restaurants nationwide\n\nBankrupt beer and pizza restaurant chain closes locations\n\nRestaurant chain famed for rude waiters closes multiple locations\n\nThese shutdowns leave only five Massachusetts locations listed on the chain’s website. Two locations are listed for New Hampshire, in Concord and Tilton. No Uno restaurants remain in Rhode Island.\n\nUno did not return a request for comment from the news station.\n\nDedham, Massachusetts: Uno Pizzeria & Grill location closed permanently on Jan. 11, after 37 years in business.\n\nRevere, Massachusetts: Longtime local restaurant shut its doors on Jan. 11, ending 34 years of service.\n\nBraintree, Massachusetts: Uno closed this 33-year-old location on Jan. 11.\n\nWarwick, Rhode Island: The last Uno Pizzeria & Grill in Rhode Island closed alongside the Massachusetts locations.\n\nSignificant reduction in total units: Uno has been shrinking over the past few years; it closed more than a quarter of its U.S. system in 2024, dropping from around 68 locations to about 53, and continued closures have pushed that count lower in 2025, reported Nation's Restaurant News (NRN).",

When supplies did return, residents described the liquid flowing from their taps as black, foul-smelling, and unsafe to use.\n\n\"Everyone's health is deteriorating,\" Shashi Bala, a resident of the affected Sharma Enclave neighborhood, told CNN. \"Everything is dirty here.\"\n\nThe Yamuna, recognized by many as sacred, provides about 40% of Delhi's water supply, but industrial waste and untreated sewage have poisoned the waterway for decades. An official oversight body found that Delhi is responsible for 76% of the river's contamination, even though just 2% of the waterway runs through city limits.\n\nOxygen levels in sections of the river regularly reach zero, according to CNN, killing aquatic life and creating thick layers of polluted white froth on the water.\n\nFor the 20 million people living in the Indian capital, contaminated water poses serious health risks. Residents have reported skin irritation after bathing, and many have been forced to drink discolored water because they cannot afford bottled alternatives.\n\nBhagwanti, 70, told CNN her taps ran dry for nearly a week before darkened water began running.\n\n\"There is so much smelly black water coming in,\" she said. \"There's no facility for cleaning. There's no facility for water. They don't care if you live or die.\"\n\nMillions of people now live in informal housing developments that lack connections to the city's water and sewer lines. Raw sewage filters down into aquifers below ground, contaminating well water.\n\nDelhi officials have announced plans to increase sewage processing from current levels to 1,500 million gallons a day and to extend sewer lines to all informal housing areas by 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, international nonprofits like Water.org and charity: water are funding sanitation projects in underserved communities.

    "title": "10 Behaviors People Mistake For Weakness That Actually Show Strength",
    "description": "These behaviors are often considered \"weak,\" even though they show strength.",
    "fullText": "We're taught that strength is loud, aggressive, unyielding—that it means never backing down, never showing vulnerability, never admitting you're wrong. But I've learned that's not true. Some of the strongest people I know are the ones who cry openly, who apologize when they mess up, who walk away from fights they could win. The behaviors that get labeled as weak are often the hardest ones to pull off. And the people who can do them? They're not weak. They're just strong in ways that make other people uncomfortable.\n\nSaying \"I'm sorry\" shouldn't be hard, but for a lot of people, it is.\n\nThey'll twist themselves into knots trying to avoid admitting fault—deflecting, justifying, blaming circumstances or other people. Research on conflict resolution and ego defense mechanisms shows that individuals who struggle to apologize often have fragile self-concepts, viewing admission of wrongdoing as a threat to their identity rather than a step toward repair. But apologizing when you've actually messed up takes strength. It means you care more about making things right than protecting your pride. It means you can sit with the discomfort of being wrong without spiraling into shame or defensiveness. Weak people protect their ego at all costs. Strong people protect their relationships.\n\nIt takes more courage to say \"I don't know\" than to pretend you have all the answers. People mistake it for incompetence, but it's actually intellectual honesty. You're secure enough to admit the limits of your knowledge instead of bluffing your way through. You're willing to look uncertain in the moment rather than be wrong later. That's not weakness—that's confidence. Weak people can't admit gaps in their understanding because their entire sense of worth is tied to appearing knowledgeable. Strong people can say \"I'm not sure\" without their ego collapsing.\n\nPeople see asking for help as admitting defeat, as proof that you couldn't handle it on your own. But it's the opposite. It means you're secure enough to recognize when you're in over your head and humble enough to reach out. It means you value getting the problem solved more than you value looking like you don't need anyone.\n\nStrong people know that asking for help isn't a failure—it's resourcefulness. Weak people struggle in silence because they're too afraid of how it will look if they admit they can't do it alone.\n\nTears make people uncomfortable.\n\nThey're seen as a loss of control, a sign that you can't handle your emotions, proof that you're too sensitive or fragile. But crying isn't weakness—it's release. It's your body processing something too big to hold inside.\n\nThe people who cry aren't the ones who can't handle their emotions. They're the ones who feel them fully instead of shoving them down. They're not afraid of being seen as vulnerable because they know vulnerability isn't the same as weakness.\n\nThe people who never cry? Often, they're just scared of what might come out if they let themselves feel anything at all.\n\nIt's easy to escalate. To match someone's energy, to fire back, to prove you won't be pushed around. What's hard is choosing not to engage when you easily could. Research on self-regulation and conflict avoidance shows that the ability to disengage from provocation requires significant executive function and emotional control, with individuals who can walk away from unnecessary conflict demonstrating higher stress tolerance and long-term relational success. Walking away isn't about being scared or passive—it's about recognizing that some battles aren't worth your energy. Strong people don't need to win every argument. They can let someone else have the last word because their sense of self isn't dependent on proving a point. Weak people can't walk away. Their ego demands they engage, that they defend, that they win. And that need to always fight back? That's what's actually weak.\n\nPeople don't like it when you say no. They'll call you selfish, difficult, and cold. They'll make you feel guilty for not accommodating them.\n\nStudies on interpersonal boundaries and relational health indicate that boundary-setting, particularly in close relationships, is one of the most challenging interpersonal skills, requiring both self-awareness and the ability to tolerate others' disappointment without capitulating. But setting boundaries isn't selfish—it's self-preservation. It takes strength to disappoint someone, to hold a line even when they're pushing back, to prioritize your own well-being over their convenience. Weak people can't do it. They cave. They say yes when they mean no because they can't handle the discomfort of someone being upset with them. Strong people can sit with that discomfort. They know that protecting their limits is more important than keeping everyone happy.\n\nSome people see changing your mind as flip-flopping, as not having conviction, as proof you didn't know what you were talking about in the first place. But changing your mind when you get new information is growth. It means you're not so attached to being right that you can't admit when your perspective shifts. It means you value truth over consistency.\n\nWeak people dig in. They double down on positions they no longer believe in because admitting they were wrong feels like losing. Strong people evolve. They're not trying to maintain an image—they're trying to get it right.\n\nVulnerability gets mistaken for neediness or emotional instability.\n\nPeople think if you admit you're struggling, if you let someone see you at less than your best, you're weak. But it's the opposite. Showing vulnerability means you trust someone enough to let them in. It means you're willing to risk being seen—really seen—even when it's uncomfortable.\n\nResearch on attachment and intimacy shows that the capacity for vulnerability is a cornerstone of secure relationships, with individuals who can express needs and fears demonstrating greater relational satisfaction and emotional resilience than those who maintain emotional distance. Weak people hide. They keep everything surface-level because they're terrified of being judged or rejected. Strong people open up. They know that real connection requires risk, and they're brave enough to take it.\n\nThere's this culture of glorifying exhaustion. People brag about how little they sleep, how much they're juggling, how they never stop. And if you admit you're tired? You're lazy. You're not hustling hard enough. You can't keep up. But admitting you're tired is recognizing that you're human, that you have limits, that pushing yourself past the breaking point doesn't make you strong, it just makes you broken. Strong people know when to rest. They listen to their bodies. They stop before they collapse. Weak people can't. They keep going until they have no choice but to stop, and then they wonder why everything fell apart.\n\nAcceptance feels like giving up.\n\nPeople think that if you stop fighting, stop trying to force an outcome, stop holding on to something that isn't working, you're weak. That you didn't care enough. That you quit too easily.\n\nBut letting go when you've done everything you can takes incredible strength. It means accepting reality instead of battling it. It means trusting that some things aren't yours to fix, that not everything bends to effort, that you can care deeply about something and still walk away when it's clear it's not going to change.\n\nWeak people cling. They exhaust themselves trying to control the uncontrollable because releasing their grip feels like failure. Strong people know the difference between persistence and stubbornness. They know when to hold on and when to let go. And they have the courage to do both.",

    "fullText": "Gujarat has joined an exclusive club of Indian states that host lions, tigers, and leopards after wildlife officials confirmed a tiger is now living in the Ratanmahal Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\nAccording to The Economic Times, a forest camera caught a photo of the large striped cat in February after patrol staff noticed unusually large footprints during their rounds.\n\nWhen the prints appeared too big to belong to a leopard, officials reviewed the footage and spotted the tiger in images snapped during the early hours of the morning.\n\nThis sighting marks a remarkable comeback for the species in the region. Back in 1992, Gujarat dropped off India's tiger count after a 1989 survey turned up footprints but no actual animals.\n\nNow, after decades without a confirmed population, the National Tiger Conservation Authority has added Gujarat back to its official tally.\n\nThe return of tigers to this part of India could benefit both wildlife and local communities. Tigers help keep forests healthy by regulating prey populations, and this protects vegetation and supports cleaner waterways. Thriving tiger habitats often boost eco-tourism, and nearby villages see new jobs and income as a result.\n\nWildlife experts with the national authority studied the sanctuary and determined that Gujarat offers a fitting home for these animals. Their assessment included recommendations for habitat improvements that could support a growing population over time.\n\nAccording to Gujarat's forest minister Arjun Modvadia, officials shared news of the tiger with the National Tiger Conservation Authority. After studying the area, the authority found Gujarat well-suited for supporting tigers and offered suggestions for improving habitat conditions.\n\nModvadia noted that his department is actively working to build better conditions for tigers across Gujarat.\n\nIf you want to support tiger conservation, consider donating to organizations working to protect wild habitats or advocating for stronger wildlife corridor protections in your own community.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Craig Mundie, ex-Microsoft exec, discusses AI's impact on education. He urges a shift to personalized learning with AI and STEM-humanities integration.",
    "fullText": "Ex-Microsoft exec Craig Mundie has heard this question again and again — parents asking him a version of the same worry: Their kids are heading toward college, artificial intelligence is advancing fast, and jobs feel uncertain. What, exactly, should their kids be studying?\n\nThat question — what education will matter most in five years — reflects a deeper uncertainty about the future.\n\nMundie, who spent 22 years at Microsoft helping steer the company's vision toward AI and retired as the company's chief research and strategy officer in 2014, says that parents are simply asking the wrong question.\n\nIt's not only the students who have to change to fit the new AI era — it's the education system itself, said Mundie, who now advises other executives on AI and public policy.\n\nRather than chasing down the right job, Mundie urges families to prepare kids for a world where learning itself becomes continuous, personalized, and done in partnership with intelligent machines.\n\nDuring an interview with Business Insider's Reem Makhoul in June, Mundie said artificial intelligence and robotics are poised to reshape work more deeply than past technologies. See the edited cut of his interview below:\n\nThat shift, Mundie said, forces a bigger question than which job skills will survive. It challenges how societies define human value. This is something Mundie's been pondering for over a decade.\n\nIn his 2015 book \"Genesis,\" Mundie, with co-authors Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger, examined how AI could alter the human experience. \"What we say is we have to think differently about how we value ourselves and what we do.\"\n\nFor much of history, he said, dignity has been tied to work because people had to work to survive. AI could loosen that link by automating more tasks across both physical and intellectual labor.\n\nMeanwhile, humans will need to learn how to work alongside intelligent machines, and the traditional higher-education system doesn't offer a clear path toward that, right now.\n\nHe described today's education system as sharply divided between STEM and the humanities. The liberal arts emphasize reasoning, but at the expense of special technical skills you learn in STEM fields, Mundie said.\n\nStudents will need both skills moving forward. \"If I could create a new curriculum in college, it would be a liberal education in technology,\" and STEM, he said.\n\nMundie went further, questioning whether the classroom model that dominates education today still makes sense.\n\nHe traced that structure back to the printing press, which created a surge in written information and a need for mass literacy. Schools, he said, became an efficient \"machine for teaching\" because societies lacked enough individual tutors.\n\nWe can have scalable, polymathic teachers, Mundie said. \"We can have as many teachers as we want now because the AI will be the teacher.\"\n\nHe said this opens the door to a more personalized, Socratic model of learning, where students can interact continuously with an intelligent system that adapts to their curiosity, pace, and interests. Progress would be limited less by standardized curricula and more by a student's motivation and capacity.\n\nSchools and universities have been slow to embrace this shift. Early reactions often involved banning AI tools outright. \"They've now given up on that,\" Mundie said.\n\nThat resistance, he added, is typical of incumbent systems. \"The natural tendency of the incumbent is to preserve the incumbent system,\" or make only incremental changes, he added. But \"when you get something as powerful as these AIs, most incumbent systems are not going to be preserved.\"\n\nHe also pointed to early experiments on the right track, like versions of Khan Academy, an online non-profit educational platform founded in 2008 and headquartered in California. It uses an AI tutor, named Khanmigo, designed to guide students rather than simply give answers. In those systems, he said, the AI nudges students toward better questions and deeper understanding.\n\n\"So that's the difference between sort of a broad chat about anything interface and an AI application that was specifically oriented around teaching,\" he said, adding, \"That's just one tiny example of how people will build more and more apps on these common artificial intelligence platforms.\"\n\n\"We will move beyond the specific generic interface to a world of millions of applications that are really customized in some clever way to guide people to solutions in the areas they care about,\" he said. These agents may, in fact, do much of the work autonomously by interacting with others, he added.\n\nMundie said parents and older generations may have difficulty imagining this model, while children are likely to adapt quickly. The harder question, in his view, is whether educational institutions are willing to change.",

And with demand softer thanks to higher mortgage rates, a shakier economy, and still-high prices, listings are sitting on the market longer. It's giving power back to buyers, who face less competition and have more choices.\n\nRealtor.com identified 10 metros where buyers have the most bargaining power. Most are in the South, and are located in the Sun Belt — a region that stretches from Florida to California. Of all states, Florida has the most metros on the list.\n\n\"In Florida, growing supply has coincided with softening demand amid rising housing costs that have pushed more buyers to the sidelines,\" said Hannah Jones, a senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com. \"New construction has continued to add inventory even as affordability constraints have reduced buyer activity.\"\n\nHere are the 10 strongest metros for homebuyers, according to Realtor.com. Notably, two tie in eighth place.\n\nBusiness Insider included each city's median listing price and months of supply — a measure of how long it would take to sell all active and pending listings at the metro's current sales pace — using data from Realtor.com.",

    "description": "The developers behind Ukraine's interceptor drones are working to ensure that these cheap air defense tools don't become obsolete.",
    "fullText": "The developers behind Ukraine's interceptor drones are constantly having to upgrade their products to keep pace with changing Russian tactics and ensure these cheap air defense tools don't become obsolete.\n\nSeveral people directly involved with interceptor drones and their development told Business Insider that the systems are being upgraded, though how quickly those improvements roll out varies.\n\nInterceptor drones emerged last year as a crucial, low-cost tool Ukraine uses to defend against worsening Russian attacks.\n\nThese weapons are typically used to hunt fixed-wing Russian drones conducting strike and reconnaissance missions. They're armed with small warheads and fly directly into their targets or explode nearby to destroy them midair.\n\nSome Ukrainian interceptor drones cost as little as $2,500 — just a fraction of the price of the Russian drones, estimated to cost between $10,000 and $100,000, depending on their battlefield function.\n\nRussia has changed its tactics over the past year, modifying its drones to fly faster and higher and even arming them with cameras and air-to-air missiles to defeat Ukrainian defenses. The changes have forced Ukraine's defense industry to adapt.\n\nWild Hornets, a defense technology outfit making drones for the Ukrainian military, \"continuously plans upgrades\" to its drones and other related equipment like ground control systems, said Alex Roslin, the firm's foreign support coordinator.\n\nThis process occurs daily, he said, and \"innovations\" are made at all levels of the production journey, from individual components to new systems like Wild Hornets' well-known Sting interceptor drone.\n\nRoslin said the firm is focused on refining its drones and scaling up production, priorities the team discusses every day.\n\nSome other products receive improvements at a slower pace. For instance, the British government, which is working to produce thousands of interceptor drones a month for Ukraine, said in early January that it updates the design about every six weeks \"to stay ahead of Russian tactics.\"\n\nBritain said \"live battlefield data feeds straight into UK production lines, allowing rapid upgrades and faster delivery to the front line.\"\n\nAs the need for interceptor drones grows among Kyiv's forces, so does the market for these weapons. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters last month that the local defense industry is producing around 1,000 systems a day, hitting the goal he set over the summer.\n\nWith so many interceptor drones now on the market, competition is driving manufacturers to constantly improve their products to fly faster and higher to meet the Russian threats, said Oleksiy, the deputy commander of a Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces mobile air defense unit.\n\nOleksiy's unit is tasked with protecting Irpin, a city on the outskirts of Kyiv, and has historically relied on a .50-caliber M2 Browning machine gun mounted in the bed of a pickup truck to battle Russian drones.\n\nHis crew began training on new interceptor drones last year to strengthen their defensive arsenal. The drones can fly at speeds of around 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour) and reach an altitude of up to 6,000 meters (nearly 20,000 feet).\n\nHe said the quadcopter-style interceptor drone his crew trains with is updated every six months using feedback from combat forces provided to the manufacturer.\n\nThe rise of Ukraine's interceptor drones has come as Russia has invested heavily in long-range drone operations, regularly sending hundreds of drones — some armed and others decoys designed to exhaust air defenses — across the border in nightly attacks.\n\nWestern military officials and Ukrainian organizations have said that interceptor drones are responsible for downing thousands of Russian drones over the past year.\n\nNATO countries are taking note of the interceptors' success as a low-cost air defense tool, with some allies buying and deploying systems to defend the Eastern flank from possible Russian drone incursions.",

    "title": "Ukraine showed a British unit that it needs to 3D-print drone parts and be able to do it close to the fight",
    "description": "The UK's Irish Guards are learning drone warfare lessons from Ukraine, including why being able to quickly make new parts on the battlefield is key.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian battlefield lessons are pushing a British Army unit to adopt a technology that has shown promise in the war against Russia: 3D printing drone parts close to where they're needed most.\n\nLt Col Ben Irwin-Clark, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Irish Guards, an elite infantry regiment, told Business Insider that the battalion's decision to print drones and drone parts was \"definitely a lesson we picked up from Ukraine.\"\n\nThe battalion has been putting more effort into preparations for drone warfare since the unit linked up with Ukrainian troops during a training rotation, and 3D printing is key to that effort.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has shown how quickly armies must adapt, experiment, and replace broken equipment — often faster than traditional supply chains allow.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that in the last few months of working with the Ukrainians, the battalion saw just how important small drones are. It has now trained 78 of its 300 people as pilots or instructors.\n\nAnd it has also quickly learned that training with drones means breaking them. Rather than waiting on industry or time-consuming formal procurement channels, the unit decided it was faster and cheaper to fix and modify drones in-house.\n\n3D printing can shrink procurement timelines from weeks to hours. That speed matters for keeping training relevant and affordable, but it also has clear battlefield implications, where tactics and equipment needs can change in days, requiring immediate solutions.\n\nThe unit's printer is making things like bomblets and copies of Russian equipment, which the unit had struggled to procure quickly through regular channels.\n\nThe effort is part of the battalion's new and growing \"drone hub,\" a first-of-its-kind facility within the British Army where soldiers can repair drones and train for drone warfare.\n\nThose efforts are expanding. The battalion printed its first drone body last month — a shell that can be fitted with components such as battery packs, sensors, and motors — offering a low-cost, fast way to assemble new drones, with plans to make production more routine.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that the long-term plan is to significantly expand 3D printing. For now, the focus is on replicating existing technology, which he described as \"in its infancy.\" Eventually, he said, the soldiers should be able to design and print their own innovations.\n\nHe pointed to Ukrainian examples, such as modifying commercially acquired drones to drop munitions by 3D-printing attachment parts, as a model of the kind of bottom-up innovation that he wants British soldiers to emulate.\n\nThe aim, he added, is also to make the capability mobile, putting 3D printers in vehicles so parts can be produced close to the fight, in hours rather than days.\n\nThat speed close to the fight is crucial, as Ukraine's fight has demonstrated.\n\nUkrainian forces have used 3D printing to produce drone bodies and components near the front, allowing them to build new drones and return damaged ones to service within hours, rather than waiting days for replacements.\n\nSoldiers and other outfits have also printed bomb casings, which are then filled with explosives — a workaround for ammunition shortages when raw explosives are available. One volunteer group told Business Insider that its casings cost less than $4 each, making them cheap and disposable.\n\nUkrainian companies are also 3D printing spools for fiber-optic drones, the unjammable drones controlled by cables.\n\nExactly how widespread 3D printing is across Ukraine's forces remains unclear. Still, it has become an important enabler in a war where cost, speed, and adaptability matter as much as sophistication. Ukraine's military is far smaller than Russia's and benefits disproportionately from low-cost, rapidly produced equipment.\n\nThe Irish Guards picked up many of these lessons while deployed in support of Operation Interflex, the UK-led multinational mission involving 14 countries that has trained more than 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nWhile Interflex is designed to share Western and NATO doctrine with Ukrainian forces, British troops have also adapted their own training based on Ukrainian combat experience.\n\nThat has included reviving trench warfare training, revising assumptions about how future ground combat would unfold, and adding anti-drone nets across training events.\n\nUkraine is fighting a war unlike those Western militaries have experienced in decades — a large-scale, grinding industrial war of attrition against a peer adversary. By contrast, recent US and UK operations have largely been counterinsurgency campaigns.\n\nNATO countries have responded by increasing defense spending and investing in capabilities that the war has shown to be especially relevant, including drones and other low-cost systems.\n\nDrones and other low-cost solutions may not play as big a role for some Western militaries, which have deeper arsenals and more advanced airpower. It was a lack of these capabilities that largely drove Ukraine to invest heavily in drones in the first place.\n\nThat said, there is an expectation that these weapons will have a part ot play in future fights, so the US, UK, and other militaries are working out best practices on this warfighting technology.\n\nIrwin-Clark, speaking at a training demo recently attended by Business Insider, shared that \"it's really inspiring working with the Ukrainians and training Ukrainians, and I think what I hadn't anticipated over a year ago when we started our stint on Interflex is how much we would learn.\"",

    "description": "The A16z cofounder said history shows automation destroys some jobs but creates new ones, and that confident predictions about AI and work are misguided.",
    "fullText": "Ben Horowitz doesn't buy the idea that artificial intelligence is about to wipe out work as we know it.\n\nThe cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz says many of the loudest warnings about AI-driven mass unemployment rest on a flawed premise: that the future of work is predictable.\n\nHistory, he said, suggests the opposite.\n\n\"I think people are acting as though it's very predictable when it's not at all predictable,\" Horowitz said in an interview on the \"Invest Like The Best\" podcast on Tuesday.\n\n\"Why are you so sure it's going to happen next? And why are you so sure no jobs are going to be created? I don't think it's nearly as predictable as people are saying,\" he added.\n\nHorowitz's comments come as tech executives, economists, and policymakers remain split over how many jobs AI could eliminate, how quickly those changes might arrive, and whether displacement is inevitable at all.\n\nSome senior AI researchers, including computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, often called the \"Godfather of AI,\" UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell, University of Louisville computer science professor Roman Yampolskiy, and some tech leaders, including Anthropic's CEO Dario Amodei, have warned of AI's potential to replace large swaths of jobs.\n\nOthers, including OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have said AI is more likely to reshape jobs and create new roles rather than erase work outright.\n\nHorowitz, by contrast, took a longer historical view, framing AI as the latest chapter in a long arc of automation that has repeatedly destroyed jobs while ultimately expanding opportunity.\n\nThe most extreme example, he said, is agriculture. In the early US economy, roughly 95% of jobs were tied to farming, he said, adding that almost all of those roles are gone now.\n\n\"We've been automating things since the agricultural days,\" Horowitz said. \"Almost all those jobs have been eliminated. And the jobs we have now, the people doing agriculture wouldn't even consider jobs.\"\n\nThe mistake, he said, is assuming today's job categories are a reliable guide to tomorrow's economy. Each major technology shift created entirely new forms of work that were difficult, if not impossible, to imagine beforehand, he said.\n\n\"The idea that we could imagine all the jobs that are going to come, sitting here now, that AI is going to enable, I think is low,\" he said.\n\nHorowitz was also skeptical of the urgency behind job-loss predictions, saying that modern AI didn't appear overnight.\n\n\"We've had AI going right — ImageNet was what, 2012 — and then natural language stuff was like 2015, and then ChatGPT was 2022,\" Horowitz said. \"Where's all the job destruction? Why hasn't it happened yet?\"\n\nThat doesn't mean AI won't eliminate certain roles.\n\nHorowitz said he expects jobs centered on processing information for others to face pressure.\n\nBut he believes demand for creativity will rise.\n\n\"I don't really think that the door is going to close behind you,\" he said. \"I think the opportunities tend to multiply when you open up a new way of doing things.\"",

Some routes have private cabins, but mine didn't.\n\nTo travel by train, I bought a Eurail pass for $477, which gives access to most European trains for a set number of days. Some trains require only a Eurail pass, while others, including overnight trains, incur an additional discounted fare.\n\nI arrived about an hour and a half before my 9:35 p.m. train so I'd have plenty of time to find the platform.\n\nI'd need to board my assigned train car; each has a number.\n\nThe lounge is free for OBB first-class passengers traveling during the day and costs about $10 for all other OBB passengers. Since I didn't see any empty seats in the rest of the station, I paid for it.\n\nI was surprised to find I was the only one inside the lounge since the rest of the station was full of people. There were plenty of tables and chairs available.\n\nIt was a smaller selection than I've seen at Amtrak's Metropolitan Lounge, which I've visited in New York, but I wasn't hungry, so I just got a water bottle.\n\nWhen the train arrived, I didn't have time to check the car number before boarding. I just went to the closest car and asked an attendant for help.\n\nAn attendant led the way to my shared cabin.\n\nSince I've experienced more bumps on higher bunks on Amtrak trains, I chose a bottom bunk.\n\nAlthough they weren't as soft and cozy as the sheets on Amtrak trains, they were better than nothing.\n\nMy fellow passengers and I agreed to turn off the lights once everyone was settled into bed.\n\nSome of us watched our devices, while others went right to sleep.\n\nAccording to Nightjet's website, only private sleeper cabins come with a shower.\n\nI woke up several times during the night to other travelers entering and exiting the room, or due to the bumpiness of the train.\n\n\"Offering our passengers a high level of travel comfort is an important concern for us,\" a representative for OBB Nightjet told Business Insider. \"We are constantly working on improvements to our product and also take into account the requirements of our customers.\"\n\nWhile sometimes it's about the journey, not the destination, in this case, I'd rather arrive feeling refreshed so I can enjoy where I'm going.

    "fullText": "Peter Attia, the prominent longevity doctor and CBS contributor who is under scrutiny for his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has vanished from a list of advisors for a sleep technology company.\n\nAttia had been prominently showcased as one of three members of Eight Sleep's scientific advisory board, a post he had held since May 14, 2024. His photo no longer appears as part of the panel on the company homepage.\n\nCompany officials and Attia did not respond to requests for comment. It's not clear exactly when his name and photo were removed, but the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine shows they were there as recently as January 22.\n\nThe disappearance comes days after the Justice Department's latest release of documents from the investigation into Epstein, the well-connected financier who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.\n\nEarlier this week, Attia addressed the appearance of his name in the files, saying that he was not involved in criminal activity and was never on Epstein's plane or private island or at any sex parties.\n\n\"I apologize and regret putting myself in a position where emails, some of them embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible, are now public, and that is on me. I accept that reality and the humiliation that comes with it,\" he added.\n\nThe documents include many email exchanges between Attia and Epstein, including one where he said that female genitalia is \"indeed, low carb.\"\n\nAttia subsequently stepped down as chief science officer of David Protein, a popular protein snack bar company he invested in and helped promote.\n\nDays before his correspondence with Epstein became public, Attia was named by CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss as one of 19 new contributors. CBS has not publicly addressed his ties to Epstein.\n\nAttia is the founder of the longevity app Outlive, the author of the bestselling book \"Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity,\" and host of the podcast \"The Peter Attia Drive.\" He appeared on a segment of CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in October.\n\nHis emails with Epstein date to the mid to late 2010s — after Epstein's guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from a minor but before he was arrested on federal charges of running a sex-trafficking operation with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nIn his statement, Attia said he met Epstein in 2014 and over the next five years, visited his Manhattan home seven or eight times to \"research studies and to meet others he introduced me to.\"\n\n\"When I was at his home, it was either meeting with him directly, meeting with small groups of scientists, doctors, or business leaders, and once at a dinner in 2015 with a number of guests including prominent heads of state,\" he wrote. \"In retrospect, the presence and credibility of such venerable people in different orbits led me to make assumptions about him that clouded my judgment in ways it shouldn't have.\"\n\nHe said that he asked Epstein about his 2008 conviction and \"he characterized it as prostitution-related charges.\"\n\n\"In 2018, I came to learn this was grossly minimized,\" Attia added. \"I was incredibly naïve to believe him. I mistook his social acceptance in the eyes of the credible people I saw him with for acceptability, and that was a serious error in my judgment. To be clear, I never witnessed illegal behavior and never saw anyone who appeared underage in his presence.\"\n\nEight Sleep, founded in 2014 and the maker of \"sleep fitness\" products, was valued at $500 million in 2021.

In other words, a short regional train counts the same as a multi-day route that crosses several states.\n\nHowever, if a trip requires a transfer, that counts as two segments, so choosing the most direct route helps to stretch the pass further.\n\nPlus, long rides in coach can often run passengers hundreds of dollars if booked individually, so even a few rides might cover the cost of the pass.\n\nI'll be honest — there have been times when I wished I had a private room so I could stretch out or have a little more privacy on the train.\n\nBut one of the tradeoffs with the USA Rail Pass is that I'm placed in a coach seat for every segment and don't have the option to upgrade to a sleeper car.\n\nLuckily, the seats on Amtrak (which are typically about 23 inches wide) recline, have a decent amount of legroom, and are generally quite comfortable. However, the only downside is they don't lie flat.\n\nSo, when going on multiple long-distance trips with the pass, I recommend taking a break between rides to stay at a hotel.\n\nDining-car meals are included for passengers traveling in roomettes and sleeper cars, but unfortunately, they are not included for coach passengers traveling with the USA Rail Pass.\n\nAlthough I can sometimes request a dining-car reservation if there's space, it's first-come-first-served and can fill up quickly. Plus, the additional cost adds up quickly.\n\nAs a coach passenger, I do get access to the café car, which serves coffee, snacks, sodas, salads, and a few reheated items like breakfast sandwiches or mac and cheese.\n\nHowever, I usually pack my own food to keep costs down. Although the staff cannot reheat or refrigerate anything for me, they sometimes give me hot water if I ask nicely.\n\nSo, I bring things like powdered soups, oatmeal packets, tea, and snacks that keep well at room temperature.\n\nAll passengers, regardless of ticket type or class, can bring two carry-ons and a personal item with them on the train. However, I recommend packing light to allow yourself enough time to get on and off the train quickly.\n\nIn order to keep myself organized, I also like to pack a smaller bag in my carry-on that includes anything I'll want easy access to during the trip.\n\nFor example, I carry extra layers of clothing in case I get cold, a neck pillow, a light blanket, earphones, an eye mask, earplugs, and hygiene products.\n\nWhile on long-distance routes, I've noticed that Amtrak's WiFi often becomes unavailable. I've sometimes been able to use my phone's hotspot, but even so, I've encountered long stretches without any cell service at all.\n\nNow that I'm a seasoned traveler, I like to plan ahead by downloading movies, music, books, or maps before my trip.\n\nHowever, I've also found that train travel is a good time to journal or sketch, write a postcard to a loved one, or simply daydream.\n\nCertain trains come equipped with a Sightseer Lounge, which offers beautiful views of the country from large windows. The louge, which includes a mixture of booths, single, and double chairs, is my favorite spot on any train that has one.\n\nAs a frequent traveler, I've seen the glow of golden hour over a field of wheat, the soft rise of mountain ranges, and canyons filled with rivers and patches of fall color.\n\nIn my opinion, sights like these are what make rail travel truly special.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will not be attending the Super Bowl after being warned he would likely be resoundingly booed by the crowd inside the stadium, according to a report.\n\nThe thin-skinned president had previously offered the unlikely excuse that he would not attend the NFL championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday in Santa Clara, California, because it was “too far away” and because he disliked the planned performers, Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\nHowever, several of Trump’s advisers have now told Zeteo that the 79-year-old was urged not to attend the game in the deep-blue Democratic state because he would likely receive a less-than-friendly reception.\n\nClips of Trump being loudly booed in front of tens of thousands of spectators—and potentially more than 100 million viewers at home—going viral would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told Zeteo.\n\nTrump was met with a mixture of boos and cheers when he attended last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nBut since then his approval ratings have plummeted across the board, with the president losing support over his handling of the economy and his hardline immigration policies, particularly in the wake of the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump’s dire polling numbers, combined with the Super Bowl being held in a state that has overwhelmingly rejected him in the past three presidential elections, led one aide to conclude it was “best to stay away from this one.”\n\n“Whatever [the crowd’s makeup] ends up being, it’s not gonna be a Turning Point USA speech,” the aide said.\n\nTrump told the New York Post last month that he would skip this year’s Super Bowl because he was unhappy that Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny would be performing the halftime show. Veteran punk rockers Green Day, who are also vocal critics of the president, are performing at the Super Bowl opening ceremony.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nTurning Point USA announced that MAGA country singer Kid Rock will headline its “All American Halftime Show,” scheduled to take place at the same time as the official halftime performance from Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who predominantly sings in Spanish.\n\nTrump also offered the dubious explanation that he was unwilling to travel to California because it was “just too far away,” despite regularly flying around the world and having attended last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nHe told the New York Post that he would be welcomed by the crowd if he dared to go. “They like me,” he said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle insisted that Trump would receive a warm welcome if he attended Super Bowl LX in person.\n\n“President Trump is working hard on behalf of the American people,” Ingle told Zeteo. “If he did attend the Super Bowl, he would receive a warm welcome because America knows he has done more to help this country than any other president in history.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes pounded Gaza on Wednesday, killing at least 21 Palestinians, including two infants, and further rocking a fragile ceasefire deal, hospital officials said. Israel said it was responding to a militant attack on Israeli soldiers that seriously wounded one.\n\nDeadly Israeli strikes have repeatedly punctuated the truce since it came into effect on Oct. 10, and the escalating Palestinian toll has made many in Gaza say it feels like the war is continuing unabated. Among the Palestinians killed Wednesday were five children, seven women and an on-duty paramedic, according to hospital officials.\n\n“The genocidal war against our people in the Gaza Strip continues,” said Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, director of Gaza City’s Shifa Hospital, in a Facebook post. “Where is the ceasefire? Where are the mediators?”\n\nIsrael strongly denies accusations that it is committing genocide in Gaza. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led militants poured into southern Israel after a surprise barrage of rockets, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and abducting 251.\n\nDeadly strikes have continued despite ceasefire deal\n\nThe deal attempted to halt the more than 2-year-old war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, it has been marred by repeated flareups of violence.\n\nA total of 556 Palestinians have been killed by Israel and 1,500 wounded since the ceasefire went into effect, according to Gaza health officials, while Israel's military says four Israeli soldiers have been killed.\n\nIsrael’s military has said its continuing strikes are responses to Hamas violations or militant attacks on its soldiers, but dozens of civilians have died. Eight Arab and Muslim countries, including mediators Egypt and Qatar, recently condemned what they called Israel’s “repeated violations” of the deal.\n\nAn Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with military policy, told The Associated Press that Israel's latest attacks were in response to militant gunfire that badly wounded a reservist soldier Wednesday morning.\n\nEarly morning strike kills 11, including two children\n\nIsraeli troops fired on a building in the Tuffah neighborhood in north Gaza, killing at least 11 people, most from the same family, said Shifa Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included two parents, their 10-day-old girl Wateen Khabbaz, her 5-month-old cousin, Mira Khabbaz, and the children's grandmother.\n\nMourners gathered in the courtyard of Shifa hospital Wednesday morning for funeral prayers.\n\n“What did this child do? …. Why are they killing the children?\" asked a relative of the family, Mohammad Jaser.\n\n“We don’t understand why this is happening to us. What do we do? Where do we go? This isn’t life,” he said.\n\nTwo young children were seen kneeling at the body of their father as a woman told them to bid him farewell. A young girl kissed her father's cheeks.\n\nStrikes on Gaza continue into Wednesday afternoon\n\nLater, an Israeli strike on a family’s tent in the southern city of Khan Younis killed three people including a 12-year-old boy, said Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies.\n\nA strike on a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis killed at least two people and wounded five others, according to a field hospital run by the Palestinian Red Crescent in the area. The dead included Hussein Hassan Hussein al-Semieri, a paramedic who was on duty at the time, said the hospital.\n\nThirty-eight Palestinians were wounded in total by the strikes Wednesday, the Gaza health ministry said.\n\nPassage through Rafah border is minimal\n\nThe Rafah border crossing’s opening Monday was hailed as a step forward for the fragile ceasefire. But since then, Palestinian passage through the crossing has been marred by delays, interrogations and uncertainty over who would be allowed to cross.\n\nIt took the entire day Tuesday for 40 Palestinians to enter Gaza. Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, they finally arrived at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where their families welcomed them. By midday Wednesday, no one else had passed through the crossing.\n\nDespite no traffic, a European Union official said the Rafah border crossing was open. An EU mission and Palestinian workers were present at the crossing. The official, tasked with communicating for the EU, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be named.\n\nThree women who crossed into Gaza on Monday told The Associated Press a day later that Israeli troops blindfolded and handcuffed them, then interrogated and threatened them, holding them for several hours before they were released.\n\nThe EU official said that the border mission had no knowledge of luggage confiscation or mistreatment by Israeli soldiers or Palestinians in the border areas.\n\nAsked about the reports, the Israeli military said that “no incidents of inappropriate conduct, mistreatment, apprehensions, or confiscation of property by the Israeli security establishment are known.”\n\nWhile all fighting has not stopped, some parts of the ceasefire deal have moved forward.\n\nHamas has released all of the hostages it was holding, and in return Israel has released several thousand Palestinians and is beginning to reopen Rafah. Increased amounts of humanitarian aid have flowed into Gaza and a new technocratic committee has been appointed to administer the territory's daily affairs.\n\nBut other key elements of the ceasefire appear to have stalled, including the deployment of an international security force, the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza. The U.S. has given no timeline on when these parts of the deal will wrap up.\n\nOver 71,800 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo and Frankel from Jerusalem.

    "fullText": "TAVRIISKE, Ukraine, Feb 4 (Reuters) - In the last few weeks, buses have stopped running to the village of Tavriiske in southeast Ukraine from the major city ​of Zaporizhzhia, some 50 km (31 miles) away.\n\nAs the war with Russia has drawn nearer, the ‌village is slowly emptying. Maryna Vyshnevska, 35, said it had become too dangerous for her and her five children - some ‌of the few remaining residents - to stay.\n\n\"We thought they (the Russians) would be driven back and all this would stop,\" Vyshnevska said, before packing her family and a handful of belongings into a police evacuation bus. \"But when we realised it would only get worse and worse, it was better to leave.\"\n\nAs Russia and ⁠Ukraine start new U.S.-brokered peace talks ‌in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, Moscow's forces have slowly ground forward along various parts of the 1,200-km (745 mile) front line in recent months.\n\nWhile closing on the ‍so-called \"fortress belt\" of cities in the eastern Donetsk region, Russian troops are also advancing toward Zaporizhzhia - which is the capital of one of four Ukrainian regions the Kremlin has claimed as its own despite occupying only part of ​the Zaporizhzhia region.\n\n'EVERY WEEK, WE SEE MORE DESTRUCTION'\n\nFighting has intensified in recent weeks in key ‌areas of the southeastern front, Ukraine's military has said, particularly around the town of Huliaipole - 40 km (25 miles) to the east of Tavriiske.\n\nIn Tavriiske and nearby villages, which sit in a bulge in the frontline with Russian forces on three sides, residents told Reuters during a recent visit that they feared for their lives amid the constant threat of drone and bomb attacks.\n\nPolice teams and volunteers roam ⁠the main regional road - which is shrouded in anti-drone netting - ​to rescue residents in danger. Local authorities said almost no ​families remain in the area around Tavriiske.\n\n\"Every day, every week, we see more destruction and a greater risk of entering towns like these,\" said volunteer Vlad Makhovskyi, ‍51, adorned with a ⁠tactical helmet and gear.\n\nAt one location, two men lugged an elderly woman out of a ramshackle house on a bright pink bed sheet.\n\nNataliia Fedorenko, 66, broke down into tears describing the ⁠mounting emotional toll of remaining in a war zone as fighting worsened. Like Vyshnevska, she also left.\n\n\"It's scary. Nobody wants ‌to die. I know I don't have much time left, but this kind of ‌death...?\"\n\n(Writing by Dan Peleschuk, Editing by William Maclean)",

    "fullText": "Two years ago, I found myself sitting in my car outside a dance studio for my first ballet class. I laughed a little as I texted a friend that I was nervous to go inside.\n\nI was 23, and my last experience with any sort of dance had been many years prior. I also had no natural musicality.\n\nThough I'd always been captivated by dancers and enchanted by the natural work ethic of prima ballerinas, what really inspired me to get out of my comfort zone was the desire for a \"third place.\"\n\nThe term, coined by sociologists, refers to a social setting beyond work and home. As a recent college graduate who'd been feeling stuck in my daily work-from-home routine and missing my long-distance friends, finding a place where I could build a community and escape life's stresses felt especially relevant.\n\nLittle did I know that years later I'd still be returning to ballet classes week after week.\n\nNot only have I learned the right way to point my foot, but I've also learned some valuable lessons that I carry far beyond the studio.\n\nWalking into the studio for my first class, I wasn't thinking I'd end up en pointe by the end of the week, but I hoped I'd enjoy it, make new friends, and learn something new.\n\nI stumbled a bit through the routines, but luckily, the instructor was careful to go slowly and show why each movement needed to be deliberate and graceful.\n\nIt was comforting to look at the other students and share a look of confusion, and a few classes later, it was nice to feel the same pride when we nailed a combination.\n\nWith so many of my friends a long plane ride away, it's been refreshing to have a local group of people with whom I can surround myself and learn something new.\n\nI know the rough sketches of what's going on in my fellow students' lives and the personalities of each teacher, and although I may not see everyone outside the studio, there's a reliable rhythm to knowing what my Wednesday nights will look like.\n\nThe studio owner and I have known each other for over two years now, and she's seen me progress into someone who actually understands the ballet commands she relays in French. We have a regular rapport, and she knows when my birthday is.\n\nHere, my peers see me in a different light than my friends and colleagues do, in my pale pink ballet slippers with my hair tied back, finally mastering bending my elbow just so.\n\nGrowing up, dance was a skill I admired, but not something I ever saw myself doing. I didn't feel confident enough to perform alongside others who might be more naturally talented.\n\nInstead, I gravitated toward playing tennis and writing — skills I felt more confident in, and still do today — but as I got older, I realized I could still choose to do ballet.\n\nOf course, I don't want to make a fool of myself, but as an adult ballerina, I have no vision of becoming a principal dancer in the New York City Ballet. Knowing that has been incredibly freeing as I laugh my way through grand battements and look at myself in the mirror during rond de jambes.\n\nThough I'm not perfect at it, I have fun and find myself learning and growing each and every class. Plus, I also have the opportunity to join in performances, which I hope to do for the first time this year.\n\nI appreciate that ballet has given me a place to learn and make mistakes without professional or personal consequences.\n\nEvery time I enter the studio, I know I'm doing something for both my younger self and who I am now, and that means the world to me.",

    "description": "As Google's earnings report looms, its AI strategy and ad business with Gemini 3 put it at the forefront of a volatile AI market.",
    "fullText": "Google has had a great run since its last earnings report. Can it last?\n\nThat's the big question ahead of the tech giant's earnings report this afternoon. BI's Hugh Langley, our resident Google expert, breaks down what you need to look out for in the numbers and on the call.\n\nGoogle has been on a three-month tear since its last check-in, launching Gemini 3 to much fanfare and joining the $4 trillion market-cap club. The string of successes put it at the front of the highly competitive AI race.\n\n(A quick aside on these arbitrary rankings. You could argue Nvidia's the biggest winner of the AI race, but it's really in its own bucket. I'm talking about companies with competing chatbots. No further questions at this time.)\n\nBut here's the thing about the AI race. It's highly volatile. One quarter, you're the belle of the ball; the next, you can't even get your texts returned. Just ask Meta and Microsoft.\n\nInvestors are expecting a big swing one way or another. Google's implied one-day share move following earnings is 4.9%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nYou don't have to search too far to find the key to Google's earnings.\n\nGoogle Search (get it) and the ad business built around it are still the company's crown jewel. It's also an area many have speculated AI would upend. (Why \"Google it\" if you can \"ChatGPT it\"?)\n\nGoogle has managed to incorporate AI features without cannibalizing its cash cow. But it's a tricky balancing act, and Google is already blurring the line between Search and Gemini.\n\nThe real tipping point will be ads. Google executives have been adamant that there are no immediate plans to bring them to Gemini anytime soon. However, if Search's massive traffic ultimately gets passed to the chatbots, advertising's arrival feels inevitable.\n\nIt also might not have a choice.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to roll out ads to some ChatGPT users despite Sam Altman previously calling them a \"last resort.\" In such a highly competitive race, and with so much money on the line, giving your rivals any type of headstart is a risk.",

    "fullText": "The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is conducting widespread layoffs.\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray wrote in a Wednesday memo that the \"substantial newsroom reductions\" would impact \"nearly all news departments.\"\n\nThe layoffs impacted hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nMurray told staff on a Wednesday morning call that the cuts were part of a strategic reset, according to an audio recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMurray said the changes included \"closing the sports department in its current form.\"\n\n\"We plan to retain several reporters to join features and cover sports as a cultural and societal phenomenon, as well as several folks to staff the print sports section,\" he added.\n\nMurray said impacted teams included audio and journalists who cover books, the DC metro area, and foreign affairs.\n\n\"A few products will be discontinued — among the most significant, we will be closing the book section and will be suspending the Post Reports podcast,\" Murray said.\n\nThe publication's San Francisco bureau was also heavily hit, one Post insider said.\n\nIn his memo, Murray wrote that for the immediate future, the paper would concentrate on \"areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers.\"\n\n\"These layoffs are not inevitable,\" the Washington Post Guild wrote in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday. \"A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach, and its future.\"\n\nFormer executive editor Martin Baron wrote in a LinkedIn post that \"there were acute business problems that had to be addressed\" during \"a period of head-spinning change in media consumption.\" Baron added that the \"Post's challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nDonald Graham, the Post's former publisher, wrote in a Facebook post that he was saddened by the loss of \"so many excellent reporters and editors\" and that he would \"have to learn a new way to read the paper,\" as he had \"started with the sports page since the late 1940's.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nThis new round of layoffs follows a series of recent shake-ups at the 148-year-old newspaper.\n\nEarly last year, the company told its opinions desk that columnists should refocus their coverage to two pillars: \"personal liberties\" and \"free markets.\"\n\nIn March, the Post reorganized its newsroom in a push to shift away from \"commodity news.\" It then offered buy-outs to staffers in May.\n\nLast year's personnel shifts arrived shortly after the Washington Post came under fire from some readers for its decision to skip endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, breaking from a 35-year tradition. Some critics argued that the decision could have been made to curry favor with Donald Trump.\n\nOver 400 staffers sent a letter to Bezos last January, writing that they were \"deeply alarmed by recent leadership decisions that have led readers to question the integrity of this institution, broken with a tradition of transparency, and prompted some of our most distinguished colleagues to leave.\"\n\nThe Post's staff reductions arrive at a challenging moment for the media industry.\n\nSome brands are seeing revenue fall off due to declines in social media and search traffic. The rise of AI is also squeezing the industry as more readers gather information from chatbots rather than visiting web pages.\n\nThe New York Times, long seen as the 800-pound gorilla in the newspaper business, saw its shares sink about 14% on Monday as investors fretted about increased costs.",

    "title": "I've shopped at Costco for over a decade. Here are the 8 biggest mistakes I see customers make.",
    "description": "Costco shoppers should avoid mistakes like buying the wrong membership, but learn how to check price tags to see what certain numbers or symbols mean.",
    "fullText": "After over a decade of shopping at Costco, you can say I'm quite a fan of the chain.\n\nI run a recipe blog and social account, Costco Kitchen, where I post delicious dishes I've made using ingredients from the wholesale retailer. It's also just my go-to place for household essentials, grocery staples, and fun finds any time of year.\n\nHowever, in my years of being a Costco shopper, I've seen many people make the same mistakes. Here are a few I suggest you avoid.\n\nCostco offers different levels of membership, but if you're a frequent shopper who buys most of your household goods at the chain, it may make sense to upgrade to the executive tier.\n\nA Costco executive membership costs $130 a year — an additional $65 from the base option — but it offers an annual 2% reward on qualifying purchases, up to $1,250.\n\nCostco's Kirkland Signature line offers high-quality products for relatively cheap, often through relationships with large brands.\n\nFor example, I've seen some Kirkland Signature house-blend coffee that's roasted by Starbucks (as indicated on the package) but often sold for several dollars less than the name-brand beans.\n\nOther products, like Kirkland Signature batteries, are also reportedly made by a major brand.\n\nTo ensure you're getting the best quality, just do your research before you opt for the house label.\n\nAt the wholesale chain, the restaurant gift cards typically cost less than their value, so you can get more food than you're paying for.\n\nFor instance, I've seen a two-pack of California Pizza Kitchen gift cards containing $100 worth of restaurant credit for $80 — leading to about $20 in savings.\n\nCostco's bakery offers some great deals — you can find a dozen muffins or bagels for relatively cheap. However, it can be difficult to eat them all before they get stale.\n\nTo avoid food waste, individually package each item in plastic wrap as soon as you get home. You can leave some out on the counter to enjoy over the next few days and store the rest in the freezer.\n\nWhen you want to eat one, simply thaw the frozen muffin, bagel, or croissant in the microwave for 20 seconds, then toast it in the oven or air fryer at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for about five minutes to let the outside get nice and crispy.\n\nYou can also take it out of the freezer the night before and leave it on the counter to enjoy in the morning.\n\nIf an item goes on sale within 30 days of your purchase from Costco, you can request a refund for the price difference, though there may be some seasonal exceptions.\n\nAlthough it can be difficult to keep tabs on every product you buy, doing so may be especially helpful for high-cost items.\n\nHowever, you can't use this policy to compare the price of online orders to in-store warehouse offers.\n\nIf you walk into just about any Costco on a Saturday or Sunday, you're almost sure to find crowds and long lines. You may even have to circle the lot just to snag a parking spot.\n\nThis increased foot traffic can also lead to certain items going out of stock and longer waits at the food court.\n\nTo avoid this, it's best to go on a weekday. But if you must shop on the weekend, I recommend arriving 30 minutes before opening — there might already be a small line outside the entrance.\n\nThis story was originally published in November 2022, and most recently updated on February 4, 2026.",

    "description": "Here's everything you need to know about the NFL's team owners, including Robert Kraft, Jody Allen, Jerry Jones, Clark Hunt, and Jeffrey Lurie.",
    "fullText": "On Sunday, one billionaire family will walk away from the Big Game a few dividends richer.\n\nWhile fans are focused on the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots, the owners of both teams have their own stakes in the outcome, with billions in franchise value on the line.\n\nThe NFL is one of the biggest businesses in the world, accounting for 30 of Forbes' top 50 sporting franchises of 2025.\n\nAnd while star players and coaches are certainly deserving of credit for that fact, it's often the owners who are responsible for the key decisions made by their franchise.\n\nKansas City Chiefs co-owner and CEO Clark Hunt, for example, hired head coach Andy Reid in 2013; the Chiefs have since appeared in five Super Bowls, winning three.\n\nOwners aren't only judged by their fanbases, though; they're judged by the players, too. Last year, the NFL Players Association released its third annual club report cards, based on a survey completed by 1,695 active players.\n\nOne of the categories players were surveyed about was ownership, which was graded based on how willing players believe an owner is to invest in the team's facilities, how much they contribute to a positive team culture, and how committed they are to building a competitive team. Each owner was given a letter grade ranging from an F- (0-49) to an A+ (97-100), which are included below.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the NFL's team owners, from how they acquired their team, to their NFLPA grade, to how the team's performed during their tenure.\n\nAll owner net worths were accurate as of February 3, 2026.\n\nMichael Bidwill is a third-generation owner of the Arizona Cardinals, inheriting the team after his father, Bill Bidwill, died in 2019. Forbes estimated in 2015 that the family's net worth was $1.4 billion.\n\nThe Cardinals were originally purchased by Michael Bidwill's grandfather, Charles, in 1933 for $50,000 — now, they're worth $5.5 billion, ranking as the 45th most valuable sports team in the world, per Forbes.\n\nUnder Michael Bidwill's leadership, the team has made just one wild-card playoff appearance, which they lost in 2021, and he was given a D- by the NFL Players' Association; the report said players feel that he \"only slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a November 2023 investigation by ESPN detailed a number of workplace misconduct allegations from current and former Cardinals employees. Bidwill told the outlet in a statement that the team has \"worked hard over the last several years to improve our culture across the board,\" adding, \"We have more to do and, as I have said to every member of the Cardinals organization, that includes my own work to grow and improve as a leader.\"\n\nThe Cardinals did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHome Depot cofounder Arthur Blank, who Forbes estimates is worth $11.1 billion, purchased the Atlanta Falcons in 2002 for $545 million, famously writing the agreement on a cloth napkin during a December 2001 meeting with seller Taylor Smith. The sale was finalized just a couple of months later in February 2002.\n\nUnder Blank's leadership, the Falcons have had nine winning seasons, including eight playoff berths and a Super Bowl LI appearance in 2017. Blank also built Mercedes-Benz Stadium and was named the 2021 Sports Philanthropist of the Year by ESPN. He was given an A+ ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nPer Forbes, the Falcons are the 29th-most-valuable sports team in the world, worth $6.35 billion.\n\nAt 65, Allegis Group founder Steve Bisciotti, who Forbes estimates has a net worth of $8.5 billion, is one of the youngest owners in the NFL. He bought a minority stake from the previous owner, Art Modell, in 2000 and completed his purchase in April 2004, spending a total of $600 million, ESPN reported at the time.\n\n\"We're proud of what we're giving to Baltimore. You have to make the playoffs to have the opportunity to compete for championships, and championships are our goal. We want to be a consistent winner that avoids big lulls and not being in the playoffs for any length of time,\" Bisciotti has said.\n\nThe Ravens have won two Super Bowls under Bisciotti (2000 and 2012) and are consistently competitive, posting one of the strongest postseason records in the NFL under Bisciotti's ownership.\n\nForbes valued the team at $6.1 billion, ranking it 33rd most valuable in the world. Bisciotti received an A rating from the NFLPA.\n\nIn October 2014, energy billionaire Terry Pegula, now estimated to have a net worth of $9.3 billion, purchased the Buffalo Bills with his wife, Kim Pegula, for $1.4 billion in cash, outbidding the likes of Donald Trump and Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nIn December 2024, Terry Pegula and the Bills added 10 limited partners to the team's ownership group, described as \"non-controlling, minority interests.\" Some of these partners include former US National Team soccer player Jozy Altidore and former NBA players Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.\n\nThe diversification of ownership came after Kim Pegula was declared legally incapacitated in March 2023 following a brain injury sustained during cardiac arrest in June 2022. Kim Pegula is still listed as a co-owner by the Bills organization, but her duties as president have been assumed by Terry Pegula, who maintains the titles of co-owner, CEO, and president.\n\nDuring the Pegulas' tenure, the Bills have become a formidable team, with eight playoff appearances, including the 2020 AFC Championship. The Pegulas also own the Buffalo Sabres in the NHL.\n\nForbes reported that the Bills are worth $5.95 billion, ranking them 37th among the world's most valuable sports teams. Pegula was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nTerry and Kim Pegula are the parents of WTA No. 6 player Jessica Pegula.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist David Tepper purchased the Carolina Panthers in 2018 for $2.275 billion, ESPN reported. Tepper has an estimated net worth of $23.7 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n\"I am thrilled to begin this new era of Carolina Panthers football and am humbled by the overwhelming excitement and support for the team,\" Tepper said at the time.\n\nUnder his ownership, the Panthers endured several losing seasons and missed the playoffs through 2024. In the 2025 season, Carolina finished 8-9, won the NFC South, and made its first playoff appearance since 2017.\n\nThe team is valued at $5.7 billion, making it the 40th-most-valuable team in the world, tied with the NBA's Miami Heat, according to Forbes.\n\nTepper was given a D- in ownership by the NFLPA; in the report card, players expressed frustration over the stadium's use of synthetic turf rather than natural grass. Players also said Tepper \"only slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"only somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nThe Panthers did not respond to Business Insider's previous request for comment.\n\nIn February 2025, the Chicago Bears announced the team's longtime principal owner, Virginia Halas McCaskey, had died at age 102.\n\nHer son, George McCaskey, has served as the team's chairman since 2011, following the death of his brother, Michael McCaskey, and continues to serve in that role.\n\nHalas McCaskey had been the oldest and longest-tenured team owner in the NFL, having inherited the team in 1983 after her father, Hall of Famer and Bears founder George Halas Sr., died.\n\nUnder her ownership, Halas McCaskey saw the Bears reach four NFC Championship Games and two Super Bowls, including a win in 1986. The team has struggled in recent years, finishing the 2024 season 5-12, but they had a stronger season this year, finishing with an 11-6 record and winning their first playoff game in 15 years.\n\nThe McCaskey family was awarded an A- in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nIn 2015, Forbes estimated the McCaskey family had a net worth of $1.3 billion, and the team, which is worth $8.2 billion today, was reported to be the 10th most valuable sports team in the world in a tie with the MLB's New York Yankees.\n\nMike Brown inherited the Cincinnati Bengals in 1991 after the death of his father, Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown.\n\nPaul Brown founded the Bengals in 1967 after cofounding and coaching the Cleveland Browns (who, yes, bear his name) for more than a decade.\n\nIn 2011, the Brown family purchased the remaining 30% of the team they didn't own for $200 million in cash, becoming the sole owners of the Bengals, the NFL reported, citing Forbes. Mike Brown and his family have an estimated net worth of $5 billion.\n\nMike Brown is the Bengals' principal owner and team president. After decades of struggle, the Bengals found success in recent years thanks in part to quarterback Joe Burrow and wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, who led the team to Super Bowl LVI in 2021, losing 23-20 to the LA Rams.\n\nMike Brown received a C ownership rating from the NFLPA.\n\nFormer Pilot Company CEO Jimmy Haslam and his wife, Dee Haslam, purchased a 70% stake in the Cleveland Browns from Randy Lerner in 2012 for $1 billion. Jimmy Haslam has an estimated net worth of $8.7 billion, per Forbes.\n\nSince the Haslams took over, the Browns have had just two winning seasons, in 2020 and 2023.\n\nThey were given a C+ ownership rating by the NFLPA and, per Forbes, the team is worth $6.4 billion, making it the 28th most valuable franchise in the world.\n\nJerry Jones is the man behind the most valuable sports franchise in the world — the Dallas Cowboys — worth $13 billion, per Forbes.\n\nThat's more than 90 times what Jones paid for the team in 1989. (He paid H.R. Bright $140 million.) He and his family now have an estimated net worth of $20.8 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the Cowboys won three Super Bowls (1992, 1993, and 1995), but they haven't made it beyond the divisional round of the playoffs since.\n\nJones was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017 — the 15th owner to receive such an award — and was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nIn August 2022, the Walton-Penner Family Ownership Group purchased the Denver Broncos from the Pat Bowlen Trust for $4.65 billion, the NFL reported.\n\nThe controlling ownership designation was transferred from Rob Walton — heir to the Walmart fortune — to his son-in-law, Broncos CEO Greg Penner (who's married to Carrie Walton Penner), in October 2023. Rob Walton and his family have an estimated net worth of $142.5 billion, per Forbes.\n\nPenner oversaw the hiring of Broncos head coach Sean Payton, who, alongside rookie quarterback Bo Nix, took the team to its first playoff game since its Super-Bowl-winning 2016 season.\n\nThe Broncos are tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 18th-most-valuable sports team in the world, with a reported value of $6.8 billion.\n\nThe Walton-Penner family was given an A ownership ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nSheila Ford Hamp became the principal owner and chair of the Detroit Lions in June 2020, after inheriting the team from her mother, Martha Firestone Ford.\n\nFirestone Ford had previously taken over the team in 2014 after the death of her husband, Bill Ford Sr., who'd purchased the Lions in 1963 for $6 million. In 2015, Forbes estimated the Ford family had a net worth of $2 billion.\n\nUnder Sheila Ford Hamp's leadership, the Lions have entered an unprecedented era of success, thanks in large part to her hires, GM Brad Holmes and head coach Dan Campbell.\n\nThe Lions, valued at $5.4 billion, ranked 48th among the world's most valuable sports franchises in 2025.\n\nSheila Ford Hamp received a B+ in ownership from the NFLPA in February 2025.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are the only publicly owned team in the NFL.\n\nFans have owned the franchise for more than a century, and there have only been six stock offerings, the most recent being in 2021, with stocks worth $300. Per the Packers, the franchise is owned by more than 539,000 people who own more than 5.2 million shares.\n\nThe Packers are the 23rd most valuable sports team in the world, worth $6.65 billion, according to Forbes, and they were given an A- in ownership by the NFLPA.\n\nAnd if you're wondering how the team is actually run: It's governed by an unpaid board of directors and a seven-member executive committee.\n\nIn 1999, the Houston Texans were founded by Janice and Bob McNair. When Bob McNair died in 2018, ownership was transferred to Janice. Then, in March 2024, it was transferred to their son, Cal McNair, via a vote. Per Forbes, Janice McNair and the family have an estimated net worth of $7.3 billion.\n\nCal McNair had already been serving as the team's chair and CEO since July 2018 and January 2019, respectively.\n\nThe Texans finished the 2025 regular season 12-5 and defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 in the wild-card round of the playoffs before losing to the New England Patriots in the divisional round.\n\nForbes reported that the Texans are the 17th most valuable sports franchise in the world, worth $7.4 billion. Cal McNair was given an A ownership rating by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nSince June 2025, the Indianapolis Colts have been owned by Jim Irsay's daughters — Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, and Kalen Jackson — following the longtime owner's passing in May 2025.\n\nCarlie Irsay-Gordon is the team's principal owner and CEO. Like her father, Irsay-Gordon worked her way through multiple areas of the Colts organization, like marketing, community relations, and football operations, before becoming CEO.\n\nTheir grandfather, Robert Irsay, originally purchased the team — then known as the Baltimore Colts — in 1972 for $12 million. He moved the team to Indianapolis in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, his son, Jim Irsay inherited the team at just 37 years old. He served as the team's principal owner, chairman, and CEO during his life, and had an estimated net worth of $4.8 billion at his time of death.\n\nUnder Jim Irsay's leadership, the Colts won 10 division titles and made two Super Bowl appearances, including a win in 2007.\n\nThe Colts are the 38th most valuable sports franchise in the world, in a tie with the Houston Rockets, worth $5.9 billion, and Irsay was given a B in ownership by the NFLPA in 2025.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have been owned by the Hunt family since the beginning. Lamar Hunt Sr. founded the team in 1959 as the Dallas Texans, and the team was moved to Kansas City in 1963. After Lamar Hunt Sr.'s death in 2006, ownership was divided between his wife, Norma, and their four children: Clark Hunt, Sharron Hunt Munson, Daniel Hunt, and Lamar Hunt Jr. As of 2024, the family has an estimated net worth of $24.8 billion, per Forbes.\n\nClark Hunt (pictured above with his wife and children) became the team's CEO in 2010 and has since been responsible for team decisions, including the hiring of head coach Andy Reid in 2013.\n\nReid has since become the winningest head coach in franchise history with three Super Bowl victories alongside quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nForbes ranked the Chiefs, worth $6.2 billion, as the 32nd most valuable franchise in sports.\n\nClark Hunt's ownership rating rose from an F- in 2024 to a C- in 2025; in the report card, players said they feel he \"moderately contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nMark Davis, who has an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion, inherited the Las Vegas Raiders (then the Oakland Raiders) in 2011 after the death of his father, Al Davis.\n\nAl Davis originally purchased a 10% stake in the team in 1966 for $18,500 and increased his ownership to 67% before his death.\n\nIn October 2024, Mark Davis expanded the team's ownership, selling 5% to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, 5% to Knighthead Capital Management cofounder Tom Wagner, and 0.5% to former NFL defensive lineman Richard Seymour.\n\nThe following month, Davis agreed to sell an additional 15% of the franchise, with equal stakes going to Silver Lake co-CEO and Endeavor board chairman Egon Durban and Discovery Land Company founder and chairman Michael Meldman.\n\nDespite the changes, Davis remains the team's principal owner and was given an A rating by the NFLPA in February 2025. The Raiders are reportedly worth $7.7 billion, making them the 13th-most-valuable sports team in the world.\n\nIn 2018, Dean Spanos became the principal owner of the Los Angeles Chargers (previously the San Diego Chargers) after the death of his father, Alex Spanos.\n\nThe elder Spanos had owned the team since 1984, after purchasing a 60% stake for $70 million, ESPN reported. He went on to buy out minority owners' shares to own 97% of the team, which was passed on to his four children. In 2018, the Spanos family had an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion.\n\nDean Spanos took over daily operations as team president in 1994, and has passed along day-to-day duties to his sons, AG and John Spanos, who now work as president of business operations and president of football operations, respectively.\n\nIn October 2024, billionaire Tom Gores purchased a 27% stake in the team for $750 million.\n\nThe Chargers are tied with the Chicago Bulls and Mercedes (F1) as the 34th most valuable sports franchise in the world, worth $6 billion.\n\nSpanos' NFLPA ownership ranking improved from a C+ in 2024 to an A in 2025. In the latest report card, Spanos was given a 9.6/10 rating for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities\"; players also said he \"significantly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"extremely committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nIn August 2010, Stan Kroenke paid $750 million to become the principal owner of the St. Louis Rams. He had previously been a minority owner of the team, purchasing a 30% stake in 1995 and increasing it to 40% stake by 1997.\n\nIn 2016, fellow NFL owners approved Kroenke's proposal to move the Rams back to Los Angeles, and in 2021, he opened SoFi Stadium, home to both the Rams and the Chargers.\n\nThe LA Rams are worth $10.5 billion, according to Forbes, making them the third most valuable team in sports, behind the Dallas Cowboys and the Golden State Warriors, while Kroenke himself has an estimated net worth of $21.3 billion.\n\n\"Stan has the vision, resources, inspiration and creativity to create the right setting for the NFL in Los Angeles,\" Jerry Jones has said, calling him \"a valuable asset to the National Football League.\"\n\nSince 2010, the Rams have made seven playoff appearances, all under head coach Sean McVay. The Rams won the Super Bowl in 2022 at home at SoFi, becoming just the second team to win the Super Bowl at home.\n\nKroenke was given a C ownership rating by the NFLPA.\n\nHe also owns Premier League team Arsenal FC.\n\nIn January 2009, billionaire Stephen M. Ross completed his purchase of the Miami Dolphins for a total of $1 billion. Ross had initially purchased a 50% stake in the franchise in February 2008 for $550 million, and the following January, he purchased an additional 45 percent of the team, leaving 5% to previous owner Wayne Huizenga, ESPN reported.\n\nAfter his 2009 purchase, Ross said, \"That is the most important thing, and the thing that drives me — creating and being part of a winning organization. There is nothing more important than that.\"\n\nToday, Ross is the chairman of the board, managing general partner, and owner of the team, which is worth a reported $7.5 billion, making it the 15th most valuable franchise in sports in a tie with the Los Angeles Clippers. Ross has an estimated net worth of $17 billion.\n\nThe Dolphins were the highest-ranked team in the league by the NFLPA, earning an A or A+ in all categories, including treatment of families, the locker room, weight room, training staff, head coach, and ownership. Ross himself earned an A+ ranking, one of only three owners to receive such high praise.\n\nIn June 2005, Red McCombs sold the Minnesota Vikings to brothers Zygi and Mark Wilf, their cousin Lenny Wilf, and their co-investors for $600 million. Zygi Wilf is widely reported to have an estimated net worth of $1.3 billion, although it hasn't been reported by Forbes.\n\nToday, Zygi Wilf is the chairman and control owner of the team, though the trio's individual stakes have never been divulged, Sport Business Journal reported.\n\nThe Vikings ranked as the second-best team in the NFL, according to the NFLPA's 2025 report cards, earning A+ marks in ownership, head coach, locker room, and treatment of families.\n\nUnder the Wilfs' ownership, the team opened US Bank Stadium in 2016 — the largest construction project in Minnesota's history — and has made multiple playoff appearances, though the Vikings haven't reached the Super Bowl since 1976.\n\nThe Vikings are the 31st most valuable team in sports, worth $6.25 billion, per Forbes.\n\nRobert Kraft is one of the best-known owners in the league. He purchased the New England Patriots in 1994 for $172 million and now has an estimated net worth of $13.8 billion.\n\nThrough the purchase, Kraft became the team's chairman and CEO, and he pledged \"to help bring a championship to New England.\"\n\nMore than 30 years later, the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history with six Super Bowl victories from 10 appearances. This year, they're going for a record seventh win.\n\nPer Forbes, the Patriots are worth $9 billion — more than 52 times what Kraft bought the team for.\n\nHe received a D ownership ranking from the NFLPA. On the report card, Kraft was rated 6.15/10 for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities,\" and players said he \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" Kraft announced that a new, $50 million training facility is expected to open this year.\n\nThe Patriots did not previously respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn 2018, Gayle Benson inherited the New Orleans Saints from her husband, Tom Benson, after his death. She has an estimated net worth of $7.9 billion, Forbes reported.\n\nTom Benson had previously purchased the team in 1985 for about $70 million.\n\nIn 2021, Gayle Benson told The Times-Picayune that after her death, the succession plan is to sell the Saints and the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans (which she also owns) to a buyer who promises to keep the teams in New Orleans and donate all the proceeds to charities.\n\n\"When Tom bought this team, he didn't have a lot of money. Everything that he had, had to be given to keep the team. He worked really hard to get the Pelicans here. He sacrificed a lot. I want to make sure that we keep the teams here. I want them to stay in New Orleans forever,\" Benson said.\n\nBenson was given an A ranking in ownership by the NFLPA. The Saints, worth $5.3 billion, did not make Forbes' list of 50 most valuable sports teams in 2025, but it ranks 31st most valuable out of all 32 NFL teams.\n\nThe New York Giants were founded in 1925 by Tim Mara and have been part of the Mara family ever since.\n\nTeam ownership was passed to Tim's sons, Jack and Wellington Mara, in 1959, and now the team is run by principal owner, CEO, and president John Mara, who took over in 2005 after his father, Wellington's, death. John Mara had been with the organization since 1991.\n\nHowever, while John Mara is listed as the team's principal owner, he's actually shared ownership with Steve Tisch since 2005.\n\nSteve Tisch's father, Preston Robert Tisch, purchased a 50% stake in the Giants in 1991, and after his death, Steve became chairman and executive vice president.\n\nTogether, Mara and Tisch helped plan and build MetLife Stadium, and the team has won two Super Bowls (2008 and 2012) under their leadership. However, the team has struggled in recent years, winning just four games last season.\n\nStill, the Giants are the fourth most valuable team in sports, worth $10.1 billion. Tisch has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion, Forbes reported, while Mara reportedly has an estimated net worth of $500 million.\n\nTisch was not named in the 2025 report card; Mara was given a C+ ownership ranking by the NFLPA.\n\nWoody Johnson — of Johnson & Johnson lineage — purchased the New York Jets in 2000 for $635 million. Forbes estimated in 2024 that the Johnson family had a net worth of $16 billion.\n\nThe Jets have struggled under his leadership, having failed to make the playoffs for the past 15 seasons. Johnson was also accused of letting his teenage sons, Brick and Jack, make decisions for the organization, as reported by The Athletic and ESPN's Rich Cimini in 2024.\n\nJohnson denied those claims in a January 2025 interview with the New York Post, telling the outlet they were \"unsubstantiated\" and that his son Brick \"has no role in the organization.\" Johnson added, \"When you're losing games, it gives people the artistic license to kind of do what they want.\"\n\nWhen reached by Business Insider for a comment in January 2025, a representative for the Jets shared the earlier comments made to the New York Post.\n\nThe Jets finished the 2025 season 3-14 and will be looking to greatly improve under new head coach Aaron Glenn and new GM Darren Mougey, and without quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was released by the team in February 2025.\n\nJohnson's ownership ranking declined from a B- in 2024 to an F in 2025. In the report card, players said they feel he \"does not contribute to a positive team culture\" and is \"somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" The Jets declined to comment on the rating when reached by Business Insider.\n\nStill, the team is considered the 12th most valuable franchise in sports, worth $8.1 billion, per Forbes.\n\nBusinessman Jeffrey Lurie purchased the Philadelphia Eagles in 1994 for $185 million. He now serves as the team's chairman and CEO, and he and his family have an estimated net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Eagles have made the playoffs numerous times and won two of their four Super Bowl appearances.\n\nLurie received a B ranking from the NFLPA, and the team is worth $8.3 billion, per Forbes, making it the ninth-most-valuable franchise in sports.\n\nSimilar to the Mara family and the Giants, the Pittsburgh Steelers have been part of the Rooney family since 1933, when the team was founded by Art Rooney. He remained the team's chairman until his death in 1988.\n\nAfter his death, his son Dan Rooney took over ownership until his death in 2017.\n\nNow, Dan's son, Art Rooney II, is responsible for most of the franchise's stake. However, he's been an active member of the organization since 1989, when he was first on the team's board of directors. He was named president of the Steelers in 2003.\n\nSince 2017, the Steelers have made six playoff appearances, though they've failed to get past the divisional round. Despite recent difficulties, the Steelers remain one of the most successful franchises in NFL history, with six Super Bowl wins from eight appearances.\n\nThe Steelers are the 26th most valuable team in sports in a tie with Ferrari (F1), worth $6.5 billion. In 2015, Forbes reported that the Rooney family had an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion.\n\nArt Rooney II received a D in the NFLPA's ownership ranking. He was given a 6/10 for his \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities,\" and players feel he \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and is \"committed to building a competitive team.\"\n\nThe Steelers did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn 1977, Edward DeBartolo Sr. paid $13 million for the San Francisco 49ers to give to his son, Edward DeBartolo Jr.\n\nEdward DeBartolo Jr. ran the 49ers organization throughout the '80s and '90s, leading to five Super Bowl wins and securing his position in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But in 1998, DeBartolo pleaded guilty \"to not reporting a bribe from a Louisiana government official,\" Forbes reported, so his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, took over ownership in 2001. DeBartolo Jr. was pardoned by Donald Trump in February 2020.\n\nDeBartolo York and her husband, John York, have been cochairs of the team since then, while their son, Jed York, has been CEO since 2010.\n\nIn March 2024, ESPN reported that Jed York was moving to become the team's principal owner. \"I think it's just a move from a family standpoint to just keep this team in our family for generations to come,\" he said, per ESPN.\n\nThough the team hasn't won a Super Bowl since 1994, it has remained competitive. In the last six seasons, the 49ers have made four NFC Championship and two Super Bowl appearances.\n\nThe 49ers are the eighth most valuable franchise in sports, worth $8.6 billion, and the DeBartolo-York family received an A- in ownership from the NFLPA. They have an estimated net worth of $8.4 billion.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are owned by the Paul G. Allen Estate.\n\nPaul G. Allen was the cofounder of Microsoft alongside Bill Gates. He purchased the Seahawks in 1997 for $194 million.\n\nAt the time of his death in 2018, he had an estimated net worth of $20.3 billion. His estate has since been controlled by his sister, Jody Allen. In July 2024, Sports Illustrated reported she is the team's principal owner and that there's a \"mandate that she eventually sells the team and donates the proceeds to charitable causes\" that Paul Allen supported.\n\nOther members of the Seahawks' senior leadership include president Chuck Arnold and GM John Schneider.\n\nThe Seahawks have been steady since 2018, making multiple playoff appearances and, in the 2025 season, advancing to the Super Bowl, their first NFC Championship and Super Bowl berth since 2014.\n\nThe team is valued at $6.7 billion by Forbes, making it tied with the Boston Celtics for 21st most valuable sports franchise. Jody Allen was given a C+ in ownership.\n\nOwnership of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is split between the six siblings of the Glazer family: Avram Glazer, Bryan Glazer, Darcie Glazer Kassewitz, Edward Glazer, Joel Glazer, and Kevin Glazer.\n\nThe team was purchased by their father, Malcolm Glazer, in 1995 for $192 million, and they inherited it after his death in 2014. As of 2024, the Glazer family has an estimated net worth of $10.2 billion.\n\nThe NFLPA's team report card gave the family a D+ in ownership, a slight improvement from 2024's D- ranking. Players feel the family \"slightly contributes to a positive team culture\" and \"is somewhat committed to building a competitive team.\" The report also gave the family a 6.5/10 rating for \"perceived willingness to invest in the facilities.\"\n\nThe Buccaneers did not respond to a previous request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe Buccaneers have won two Super Bowls (2003 and 2021) under the Glazer family and are worth $6.6 billion, according to Forbes, making the team the 24th highest valued franchise in the world in a tie with Manchester United, which is also owned by the Glazer family.\n\nAmy Adams Strunk, who has an estimated net worth of $2.8 billion, is the controlling owner and cochair of the Tennessee Titans, having inherited the team in March 2015 after the death of her father, KS \"Bud\" Adams, in 2013. (Adams founded the team as the Houston Oilers in 1960.)\n\nSince 2015, the Titans have had six winning seasons, including five playoff berths.\n\nAs an owner, Adams Strunk has worked to increase the team's staff by more than 150% and has been a key figure in getting approval for a new stadium, the Titans reported. She was awarded a B in ownership by the NFLPA, and the team is ranked as the 30th-most-valuable sports franchise, worth $6.3 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn 2023, investor Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders from Dan Snyder for a record $6.05 billion. He made the purchase through the Harris Ownership Group, which includes limited partners like former NBA star Magic Johnson, investor David Blitzer, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.\n\n\"I feel an awesome responsibility to the city of Washington,\" Harris said after the sale, per ESPN. \"I know what I've got to do. It comes down to winning. It's on me and on our ownership group to deliver. That's what we're going to do.\"\n\nHarris has an estimated net worth of $10.7 billion, per Forbes.\n\nHarris was given an A in ownership by the NFLPA after his second season with the team. The Commanders are the 14th most valuable franchise in sports, worth $7.6 billion, per Forbes.\n\nIn the 2024 season, the Commanders made their first NFC Championship since 1992 under the leadership of head coach Dan Quinn and rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels.",

    "description": "A new consulting firm report emphasizes the growing costs and problems of sustaining advanced aircraft.",
    "fullText": "The cost for the US and other militaries to keep newer combat aircraft ready to fly is going to soar in the coming years, a new report on sustainment trends argues.\n\nA new report from the American consulting firm Oliver Wyman projects global military aircraft spending over the next decade, including an annual sustainment cost growth of 1.1% through 2036. That's a pace roughly 11 times faster than the previous decade.\n\nThe report forecasts a spike in deliveries of advanced fourth-generation and fifth-generation aircraft and more aircraft in active service across global militaries.\n\nDemand for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike stealth fighter, in particular, is anticipated to remain strong at over 50% of the fighter market as global air forces gradually replace their aging in-service aircraft.\n\nThe US and many of its allies in Europe and Asia are building advanced F-35 fighter fleets, recognized by some officers as the bare minimum for high-level modern air combat. The US and others are also exploring new sixth-generation designs.\n\n\"Costs may stabilize in the near-term as older fleets leave service\" and the cost of keeping those systems running decreases, the Oliver Wyman report says, \"but US costs will continue to rise as replacement aircraft with complex/costly designs enter service in large numbers late in the decade.\"\n\nThe F-35 stealth fighter is the US military's most advanced aircraft in service today. The US operates around 700 of these planes with plans to acquire over 2,400 of them in total. A 2024 Government Accountability Office report put the lifetime cost of the program at $2 trillion, 44% higher than the 2018 estimate.\n\nThe increase was tied to the extension of the aircraft's anticipated service life, inflation, and rising sustainment costs. The military has tried to cut costs by reducing flight time.\n\nAnother factor affecting F-35 costs is the lingering effect of the military's concurrency problem, which saw the Pentagon rush to field the jet while development was still underway.\n\nThat decision has led to billions of dollars in added cost growth and continues to complicate sustainment today as additional work is needed to bring the older airframes up to the standards of the newer production models.\n\n\"There are some issues that are unique to the F-35, and then there are issues that transcend the F-35,\" Doug Berenson, an analyst at Oliver Wyman, told Business Insider, identifying insufficient depot maintenance capacity and individual systems that require more time and specific parts to fix as issues facing broader advanced aircraft.\n\nFielding more advanced aircraft drives up maintenance and sustainment costs because their systems are more complex — from stealth coatings and software-heavy mission systems to advanced engines and avionics. Keeping those components operational generally requires more specialized labor, tighter tolerances, and more time than maintaining older aircraft.\n\nWhile the F-35 is heavily affecting sustainment spending, the B-21 Raider stealth bomber's entry into service is expected to affect the budget as well. The new F-47 will likely do the same, and the eventual maintenance costs for larger drones like the US Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft, while still somewhat unclear, ought to also have an effect on sustainment costs, though in a different way than advanced crewed aircraft.\n\nOliver Wyman's new report projects that drone deliveries across global militaries will spike in the late 2020s and early 2030s. The report says larger, higher-end surveillance and strike drones designed to fly long distances, carry sensors or weapons, and operate alongside crewed aircraft will represent a significant share of combat aircraft inventory.\n\nBerenson said the rising trend of drones was a stand-out takeaway because it's the most irreversible as more militaries embrace uncrewed systems.\n\n\"It's going to touch every mission and every element of the force, and it's going to upend what it means to do aircraft sustainment,\" he said.\n\nThe lifespans and costs of large drones vary depending on their capabilities and mission sets, but they're not nearly as exquisite as crewed combat aircraft. For example, the Air Force's plans to keep its CCAs or \"loyal wingmen\" operable for 10 years or less, upgrading them when needed but keeping them at a much lower cost. Many are seen as expendable assets.\n\nThe Oliver Wyman aircraft sustainment report said that \"these aircraft will be designed for a much shorter service life than crewed aircraft, minimizing requirements for depot maintenance, spare parts, and other services.\"",

    "title": "What Disney's new CEO pick tells us about the future of media",
    "description": "Nearly a decade ago, Disney made a giant bet on streaming. Now it's going in a different direction.",
    "fullText": "In February 2020, Disney announced that it had picked a successor to CEO Bob Iger: Bob Chapek, who was running the company's parks unit.\n\nSix years later, Disney is running it back. This time, it has picked parks boss Josh D'Amaro to replace Iger, who swears he's really leaving Disney for good this time.\n\nThe most obvious thing to say about D'Amaro's selection is that the parks business he oversees is Disney's most important business — a reliable profit and growth driver.\n\nBut a counterpoint to that is worth thinking about, too. It means the company's streaming business — the one Iger made a huge bet on back in 2017 — isn't the key to the company's future.\n\nPuck's Julia Alexander, a longtime Disney reporter who also spent a year working on the company's strategy, talked to me about D'Amaro's rise and what it tells us about Disney and the broader media business. Below is an edited excerpt of our conversation on my Channels podcast this week.\n\nPeter Kafka: Why did Disney, for the second time in six years, pick the guy who runs the parks business to run the entire company?\n\nJulia Alexander: Because going forward, Disney will be more of an experiences company than it already has been, and less of a media-first company.\n\nDisney's always been an experiences business. They're investing $60 billion [over 10 years] in that segment. It grew 6% in 2025, finishing at just over $36 billion. In the first quarter of the new year, it saw $10 billion in revenue. These are the basic data points that explain why D'Amaro is there.\n\nBut the fandom reason is that it's really difficult to try and predict what entertainment will look like a decade from now, let alone what Disney's role in entertainment will look like a decade from now — with YouTube coming in on the TV sets, with Instagram, with TikTok, with things that we haven't even seen yet.\n\nIs the parks business growing because more people are going to parks every year? Or is it growing because Disney has figured out how to extract more money from the people who are going to parks?\n\nDefinitely the latter. It's this idea that people are willing to spend more on luxury experiences.\n\nPeople will continue to spend because it is an experience that they're not going to get elsewhere, which means that [Disney] can monetize the customer at a higher rate than they're going to get in the content business.\n\nBeyond the fact that D'Amaro runs parks, and parks are the key engine to Disney, what has he done during his tenure that suggests that he's really good at it?\n\nOverseeing the launch of parks in China — Hong Kong, Shanghai. He's also the one who led the deal on investing in Epic Games, and looking at what the digital theme park component may look like.\n\nThere's also a quality to him. Someone at Disney said this to me the other day: He said there's Walt-like quality to him — as in Walt Disney — that Bob Iger [also] has.\n\nUnlike the CEO of Apple or the CEO of Nike or any of these other big American brands, the CEO of Disney really means something to Disney fans.\n\nHe's a public figure. He walks the parks and people want to come up to him. They want to take photos with him.\n\nThis is something that Bob Chapek never had. He didn't want to hang out with the people who were creating his business, who were paying thousands of dollars to hang out in these parks.\n\nDana Walden, the other primary candidate for the job, is going to stay on with a new title of chief creative officer. She's supposed to run the film and TV business. Do they expect her to stick around?\n\nIf this was 2018, 2019 — the height of streaming subscribers and everyone investing in original content — I think the question of what happens to Dana Walden is much more interesting.\n\nIn 2026, streaming is a manageable operations business. The futurist component of it has gone away. Now it's just how do we get to 10% profit margins?\n\nWe know how it works. There's no mystery to running it. There's skill, but there's no mystery.\n\nBut just because Disney picked another parks guy, and just because parks is clearly the profit center of this company over the next 10 years, does not mean that Disney works as a non-media company. The media is so important to it.\n\nSo I think that D'Amaro will continue to focus on turning this very intangible adoration for intellectual property into tangible money at the parks level, but still rely on Walden and John Landgraf [who runs Disney's FX unit] and others to make sure that the content is keeping [customer] attention long term.\n\nSix years ago, right before the pandemic came to the US, Bob Iger announced that he didn't want to be CEO anymore, and the guy running parks back then — Bob Chapek — replaced him. It didn't work out, for a bunch of reasons — one of which was that Bob Iger kind of left him a mess. What is he leaving to Josh D'Amaro this time around?\n\nI think what Bob Iger has left Josh D'Amaro in 2026 versus what he left Bob Chapek in 2020 is a stark reality versus an optimistic hope. Streaming was [supposed to be] this reinvention of a business and of a behavior. You weren't just going to have a transition of customers, you're going to have a new customer. You were going to have a new type of content, a new type of monetization.\n\nAnd very quickly, in the first few years after the pandemic, what we started to see was that it was a business. It wasn't creating new behaviors, it was just old behaviors in a different format.\n\nThat was really hard to square with analysts on Wall Street, when you've spent the last four or five years telling them that streaming is the future of your business.\n\nThere was this idea that streaming was going to be defined by how many subscribers you had. You could spend whatever you wanted. It didn't really matter. There's a lot of similarities to what's happening in the AI industry right now: This idea of just grow, grow, grow, grow, and we'll figure out revenue later. And then it all came crashing down. And all of a sudden Wall Street said, 'Okay, well, are you making money on this? And are you making, not just money, but 20% profit margins? Cable money?'\n\nSo that was a period of time where Bob Chapek had to navigate truly outlandish expectations. There was a hope that this was going to revolutionize everything. Now streaming's a manageable business.\n\nWhat D'Amaro has is the stark reality of: 'We are not going to compete with YouTube. We are not going to compete with Instagram as they come to TV sets. We're not going to compete with TikTok. We're going to hope that some kind of theatrical strategy — lean on the \"Avatars\" and the Marvels — makes sense. We're going to hope that some of the Chinese theatrical market comes back.\n\nBut we don't have the optimism that we once did — that streaming is going to solve all of our woes, of the cable business declining and wiping out billions of dollars in profit. What we do have is a fundamental reality about what we can do with the parks business and what people are willing to spend on.'\n\nSo I think it's a perfect time for Iger to step back.\n\nHe's leaving at a time when there's not this optimism that whoever comes in is going to solve the entertainment and media business. It's an expectation that the guy who comes in is going to get us through this transitional period.",

In fact, he sees it as a healthy rotation as investors pivot towards better opportunities and away from the tech-driven market.\n\nParker addressed the software stock sell-off in a coversation on CNBC, laying out why he's still bullish on tech and on the broader market, despite Tuesday's chaos. In his view, the slide actually signals a positive development as market conditions shift and the tech sector enters a corrective period.\n\n\"We're seeing a rotation,\" he said. \"It's about a broadening of the recovery story. Cyclicals are picking up the slack, and it's not just the AI infrastructure plays and the hyperscalers that are driving markets higher.\"\n\nThe strategist said that AI beneficiaries are likely to continue causing disruption, particularly in areas like software that are seen as especially prone to AI disruption. And while his team still likes the tech sector, they also think other industries are poised for growth.\n\nThese areas don't receive as much attention as AI, but Parker's bullish thesis implies that this may be about to change as disruptions in tech push investors toward other opportunities.\n\n\"There's also opportunities more broadly, whether you're thinking about cyclical opportunities in the US. We really like the industrial story and the power story,\" he stated.\n\nThe opportunities that Parker sees aren't only in the US, either. He added that his team is bullish on international markets that have been growing steadily and don't show any signs of slowing down. He urged investors not to disregard the global story as emerging markets continued to grow.\n\nParker cited the leadership that he has seen from these emerging markets as a reason for his bullishness, stating that he is encouraged by the fact that they have guided their economies through a year of solid growth. Goldman Sachs has also touted them as an area to watch in 2026.\n\n\"If you're looking for opportunities that may not be as specifically focused in technology, that are beneficiaries from this global broadening, markets particularly Asia, [excluding] Japan, that we think are going to be big beneficiaries,\" he added.",

    "title": "Anthropic's Super Bowl spot skewers ChatGPT: 'Ads are coming to AI, but not to Claude'",
    "description": "While Anthropic doesn't outright name ChatGPT, it's clear who the target of its coming Super Bowl ad is.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic is taking a shot at OpenAI on the biggest stage possible.\n\nOn Wednesday, Anthropic rolled out a glitzy ad campaign that will air nationally during Sunday's Super Bowl, which implicitly centers on OpenAI's plans to bring advertising to ChatGPT.\n\n\"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,\" the tag line reads.\n\nThe declaration shows that Anthropic is willing to draw a line in the sand with its no-AI-ads-in-chatbots stance. But the move also means Anthropic is declining to pursue a potentially key revenue stream for Claude at a time when AI companies are spending more than ever in the AI race.\n\nWith much of Anthropic's revenue coming from its enterprise business, the company may feel it's a worthwhile tradeoff and a way to further differentiate its offerings from OpenAI's.\n\nAnthropic has booked a 30-second spot during the game and an additional 1-minute ad during the pregame for what is historically the most-watched live television event in the US.\n\nThe 30-second spot features a scrawny guy asking a buffed trainer, \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" While at first the trainer gives helpful information in the voice of an AI chatbot, the trainer quickly segues into an ad.\n\n\"Confidence isn't just built in the gym, try Step Boost Max, the insoles that add one vertical inch of height and help short kings stand tall,\" the trainer says.\n\nAnthropic's 1-minute-long spot is even more provocative. It features an adult man in therapy who is trying to connect more with his mother. After giving some general advice, the AI chatbot-like voice segues into an ad for a fictional dating service for younger men seeking older women.\n\n\"If the relationship can't be fixed, find an emotional connection with other older women on Golden Encounters, the mature dating site that connects sensitive cubs with roaring cougars,\" the therapist responds in the voice of a chatbot.\n\nTwo additional ads in the campaign feature a woman in a restaurant asking for feedback on a new business idea and a student asking a professor for help with an essay.\n\nIt's not immediately clear how much Anthropic is spending on the Super Bowl campaign. Mike Marshall, head of global advertising for NBCUniversal, whose network has the rights to this year's game, recently said a 30-second spot costs roughly $8 million.\n\nLast month, OpenAI announced plans to begin testing ads in the US for its free and Go tiers of ChatGPT. While anticipated, the announcement illustrated just how much CEO Sam Altman has changed his views on monetizing the chatbot with ads.\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nAs part of the announcement, OpenAI said that ads would \"not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you.\"\n\n\"Answers are optimized based on what's most helpful to you,\" the company said in the announcement. \"Ads are always separate and clearly labeled.\"\n\nIn case the ad campaign wasn't clear enough, Anthropic released its own lengthy statement pledging to keep ads off of Claude.\n\n\"Ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking,\" the company said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nAnthropic, founded by seven former OpenAI employees, including CEO Dario Amodei, has also repeatedly shown it's not above taking implicit shots at its rival, though the Super Bowl ads represent an escalation of the AI wars.\n\nIn December, Amodei poked fun at companies that declare \"Code Reds,\" denounced others that are \"Yoloing\" by making risky bets on future AI demand, and extolled the virtues of Anthropic's business model, built on the enterprise market. Individually and collectively, the remarks came across as implicit shots at OpenAI, though Amodei repeatedly declined to name his target.\n\nWhen asked, \"who is Yoloing,\" Amodei responded, \"So that's not a question I'm going to answer.\"\n\nAnd while Anthropic still isn't naming names, the target of their taunts will be hard for Super Bowl fans to ignore.",

    "description": "Delivering food and other items could be key to making robotaxis work economically, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Uber Eats might end up playing a key role in its parent company's robotaxi business, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.\n\nThe ride-hailing app is working with multiple companies, such as Alphabet-backed Waymo, to make self-driving cars available through its app. Waymo's robotaxis have already proven more efficient than most human Uber drivers in cities such as Atlanta and Austin, Uber has said.\n\nOne big question hanging over robotaxis, though, is what happens to the vehicles during times of the day when demand for rides is low, Khosrowshahi said on Uber's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday.\n\nHe pointed to one solution: Have them drive orders to customers through Uber's food delivery and freight businesses.\n\nSome delivery services, such as DoorDash, are also experimenting with robotaxis for food deliveries. Uber offers both ride-hailing and delivery, meaning robotaxis on its network could shift between the two as demand for each changes, Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Having delivery and freight as part of our logistics ecosystem gives us an opportunity to actually use these vehicles at a structurally higher utilization than anyone else,\" Khosrowshahi said.\n\nWhile ride-hailing accounted for over half of Uber's revenue in the fourth quarter, its delivery business grew by 29%, a faster clip than the 18% growth rate its ride-hailing segment posted in the same period.\n\nHow efficiently companies use the autonomous vehicles that they put on the streets is one of the challenges hanging over the technology.\n\nSafety is another. Last month, a Waymo car injured a child near a school in Santa Monica, California, the latest in a series of accidents involving self-driving cars. Waymo said it is cooperating with a federal probe into the accident.\n\nWhile it doesn't operate self-driving cars directly, Uber is experimenting with ways to train the AI behind robotaxis using data it collects from human drivers, Khosrowshahi said. Uber has a partnership with Nvidia to collect that data, for instance. Last month, Uber said it would launch AV Labs, an arm focused on similar training efforts.\n\nKhosrowshahi said the goal is to make self-driving cars more reliable and avoid situations such as last year's Waymo blackout in San Francisco, when a power outage prompted the company to suspend services. \"The real world can create unexpected circumstances,\" he said.\n\nRobotaxis also require infrastructure to store, charge, and repair. Some companies, such as startup Voltera, are building depots for those purposes in anticipation of a robotaxi boom in the coming years.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Even though I was an expert in burnout, I didn't recognize the signs in myself — even though I was running on fumes while on vacation.",
    "fullText": "When I arrived at Vista Verde Ranch in late October for a mini-vacation, I was running on fumes. My excitement to take part in a three-day horsemanship clinic and experience all this luxury dude ranch offered provided enough adrenaline to carry me.\n\nThe truth was, my light had been dimming since the third quarter began at my consulting job. \"If I can just make it until the end of the year,\" I kept telling myself, \"at least I'll have more vacation time.\"\n\nMy life had become a series of \"If I do X, then I can,\" rules. I had learned early to pretend everything was fine, and over time, I became so good at it that I failed to acknowledge my job no longer fit my life.\n\nOn the last day of my trip, something happened that was the final wake-up call. I was experiencing burnout.\n\nI had researched and published on burnout in USA Swim coaches during my MS in sport psychology at CU Boulder.\n\nWe had posited that burnout was more than just stress by exploring the phenomenon of entrapment experienced by coaches who remain committed despite rising personal costs, diminishing joy, and the feeling of being stuck in a job.\n\nAt the time, I thought burnout was something that happened to other people — not me. But I fit the profile of an entrapped professional exactly.\n\nI recently dreamed I was trying to land a jet without doors or windows on a tight runway surrounded by water. I skidded to a stop just before sliding into the sea. My subconscious was trying to get my attention.\n\nMy body heard the message too. Blood pressure, which had been well managed, began to climb. At work, I was irritable, and my emotional buffer wore thin. All I wanted to do was sleep, yet I kept pushing.\n\nI continued to work out, maintained a home, built my writing portfolio, and stayed in a dead-end job. I had always done the responsible thing and was waiting for the right moment to finish the important projects at my job. I couldn't just quit.\n\nThis growing realization followed me to the ranch. Surrounded by mountains, a herd of 115 horses, and the kindness of an incredible staff, I expected to feel restored.\n\nInstead, I was restless, the ache in my soul growing louder.\n\nI then met several successful women my age — all at very different but similar crossroads. Six of us had traveled without partners, and we shared meals at communal tables, watched the herd run in at sunrise, and forged new friendships. We talked about what had brought each of us there and about what still felt unfinished.\n\nI spoke about \"Please See Me,\" the online literary magazine I launched in 2019, and planned to expand it \"when I had time.\" Their encouragement reenergized my commitment to keep building what mattered.\n\n\"You need to leave your job,\" one woman told me gently, a sparkle in her blue eyes, having recently been laid off herself.\n\nOn the last day of the trip, a magnificent Percheron horse named Gilbert fell into an irrigation ditch behind my cabin and died the morning I was to leave the ranch.\n\nI had a sudden realization: If an animal so strong can be running with the herd on Monday and dead by Wednesday, I'm not invincible either. I couldn't keep fighting and pushing the way I had been.\n\nI was eventually laid off from my consulting job, but not before I accepted that I was burned out.\n\nI'm building differently now. This year, I'm resting more, listening carefully, and designing a life that is flexible, financially sustaining, and authentic.\n\nMost importantly, I get to plan the next chapter of my professional life full-time.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates haven't moved much today, which means they're still relatively low. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is holding at under 6%, currently 5.98%. That's a year-over-year decrease of 61 basis points. The 15-year fixed rate is 5.50%, down 73 basis points since this time last year. Mortgage rates vary by credit score, location, and lender, so you might even be able to lock in a rate below the national average.\n\nStill under 6%: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined period, then adjust it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.98% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, mortgage rates vary by state, and if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates took a dive when President Trump announced some proposals to enhance home affordability and lower mortgage rates. Then, they jumped when his push for Greenland raised international tension. Still, according to Zillow, rates remain well a over a half-point lower than a year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction.

    "description": "The Washington Post is laying off staffers across its newsroom. Here's what executive editor Matt Murray told staffers about what comes next.",
    "fullText": "On Wednesday morning, after weeks of anticipation of layoffs, Washington Post staffers dialed into a Zoom call led by executive editor Matt Murray.\n\n\"Today will be a difficult day,\" he said, according to an audio recording of the call obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe top editor told workers to expect big changes ahead that would hit every corner of the newsroom and \"feel like a shock to the system.\"\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray said during the call. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"\n\nLater that morning, the company took an ax to its newsroom, cutting journalists across coverage areas like sports, books, and foreign affairs, according to company materials reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe job cuts included hundreds of workers, according to a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the newsroom's union.\n\nThe company, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is shrinking its international footprint, merging editing desks and its art team, and restructuring its D.C. metro coverage, Murray said during the call. Its daily news podcast \"Post Reports\" is also shuttering amid the changes.\n\nTwo staffers told Business Insider that the layoffs were far worse than what they expected.\n\nThe \"substantial newsroom reductions\" were designed to cut costs and refocus the company's work on topics that \"demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact,\" Murray told staffers in a separate memo. Those priority areas will include politics, national affairs, national security, and other forces \"shaping our future\" like science and business, Murray wrote.\n\nOn the call, Murray also mentioned artificial intelligence as a disruptor that could impact the Post going forward.\n\n\"We're still almost on just the doorstep of the dramatic changes that AI is going to bring to all of us,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Post described the changes as a \"significant restructuring\" designed to \"strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nRead the full newsroom memo from Murray below:\n\nAs we shared in our live stream earlier, the company is taking actions today to place The Washington Post on a stronger footing and better position us in this rapidly changing era of new technologies and evolving user habits.\n\nThese moves include substantial newsroom reductions impacting nearly all news departments. For the immediate future, we will concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact and that resonate with readers: politics, national affairs, people, power and trends; national security in DC and abroad; forces shaping the future including science, health, medicine, technology, climate, and business; journalism that empowers people to take action, from advice to wellness; revelatory investigations; and what's capturing attention in culture, online, and in daily life.\n\nWe will meet with leaders in each department today and tomorrow to review the impacts on their teams.\n\nToday's news is painful. These are difficult actions. We are proud of, and grateful for, the many valued colleagues whose talents and passion have contributed to The Post over many years.\n\nBut we take them with clarity of purpose. The need has never been more urgent to reposition The Post. A more flexible, sustainable model will help us better navigate unprecedented volatility, competition, technological change, news-consumption habits, and cost pressure.\n\nAs you know, we have grappled with financial challenges for some time. They have affected us in multiple rounds of cost cuts and buyouts, along with periodic constraints on other kinds of spending.\n\nWe have concluded that the company's structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product. This restructure will help to secure our future in service of our journalistic mission and provide us stability moving forward.\n\nWe are far from alone in reevaluating our model or rethinking how we operate. The ecosystem of news and information, on- and off-platform, is changing radically. News consumers enjoy more variety, voices, platforms, and options than ever before. In just the last five years, multiple startups—and even individuals—have created meaningful products that draw attention and generate impact at low cost.\n\nPlatforms like Search that shaped the previous era of digital news, and which once helped The Post thrive, are in serious decline. Our organic search has fallen by nearly half in the last three years. And we are still in the early days of AI-generated content, which is drastically reshaping user experiences and expectations.\n\nWe are producing much great journalism of which we can be proud. As we discuss every day in the news meeting, some of our best work attracts readers and generates subscriptions and engagement.\n\nUnfortunately, some does not. Some areas, such as video, haven't kept up with changes in how consumers get news and information. Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years. And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\n\nIf we are to thrive, not just endure, we must reinvent our journalism and our business model with renewed ambition. We already have taken important and, in some cases, long overdue steps toward reinvention—creating the Print desk, transforming digital workflows, and embedding Audience Strategy editors in every department. Today's moves will put us in position to find and develop better ways to connect Post journalism to news consumers in the ways they want it.\n\nFrom this foundation, we aim to build on what is working, and grow with discipline and intent, to experiment, to measure and deepen what resonates with customers.\n\nWe can't be everything to everyone. But we must be indispensable where we compete. That means continually asking why a story matters, who it serves and how it gives people a clearer understanding of the world and an advantage in navigating it.\n\nSome of you have heard me ask how we can shrink the gap between some of what we create in our newsroom during the day and what we — and our children, families, and friends — consume at night.\n\nToday's actions are about addressing those questions, forcefully, to reinvent The Washington Post for this new era. This work is difficult, but it is essential. The Post is a necessary institution, and it must remain relevant.\n\nEven amid challenges, The Washington Post retains great strengths. We have a deep pool of talented journalists and leaders, strong standards, institutional backing, a proud legacy, and millions of customers.\n\nMost important, our central purpose remains as it ever was: To produce riveting and distinct journalism of the highest caliber that breaks news, explains the world with authority and fairness, empowers people with knowledge, and helps them live better-informed lives.",

    "fullText": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was mockingly accused by critics on social media of trying to “out-Bible the Pope” after he attempted to use scripture to defend the Trump administration’s hardline immigration agenda.\n\nJohnson, a Southern Baptist, was asked to comment on Chicago-born Pope Leo’s citing of Matthew 25:35 as the current leader of the Roman Catholic Church urged “deep reflection” on how migrants are treated in the United States.\n\nPolitics: Maria Shriver Mocks Trump’s Closure Of The Kennedy Center With Her Own Vicious ‘Translation’\n\n“So you want me to give you a theological dissertation?” Johnson replied. “Alright.

    "description": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears that AI will replace software as tech stocks were rattled by new tools from Anthropic this week.",
    "fullText": "Tech stocks continued to wobble on Wednesday as Wall Street's worries that AI will replace software, a notion that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed as \"illogical\" this week.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 extended losses from Tuesday's session. The software sector led a tech-sell-off with the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF down nearly 4%, adding to its year-to-date 22% loss.\n\nBut Wall Street's fears about further disruption from AI were brushed aside by one of the icons of the AI space on Tuesday. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang weighed in on the latest jitters at a Cisco AI event.\n\n\"There's this notion that the tool industry is in decline and will be replaced by AI. You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang outlined his view that software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace, explaining that AI will use the tools software offers rather than reinventing its own.\n\nThe CEO named Service Now, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, specifically as bright spots in the space.\n\nRecent weakness in the software sector comes amid a broader market rotation away from tech. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF has seen a nearly 20% decline in the past year, and the sector fell into a bear market last week.\n\nHere are some of the stocks dragging the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF lower during Wednesday's session:",

    "description": "Software stocks entered a bear market last week. The latest bout of selling was brought on by Anthropic's unveiling of a new plugin for its Cowork agent.",
    "fullText": "Software stocks are taking it on the chin again on Wednesday.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF was down another 3% as the software sector faced selling pressure for a second straight session.\n\nThe decline comes after a particularly brutal sell-off on Tuesday as investors panicked about Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical and administrative tasks for people working in the legal industry. Legal software stocks got crushed, but the selling spilled over into the broader space by the end of Tuesday's session.\n\nSome of Wednesday's big losers in the software space include:\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq was down as much as 2% for a second day, tumbling deeper into the red in afternoon trading.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around 1:20 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nThe sector is now mired in its worst sell-off since the \"Liberation Day\" market crash, having officially entered a bear market last week after Microsoft's earnings fueled more concern about valuations and growing AI capex.\n\nThe decline reflects two fears that are top of mind for investors: On the one hand, tech stocks are broadly expensive and fears of an AI bubble still loom over markets.\n\nOn the other hand, there is great uncertainty as to how the business model for software companies could change, Craig Johnson, a managing director and chief market technician at Piper Sandler, told Business Insider.\n\nInvestors are mulling the extent to which these are existential threats to certain companies or if they'll somehow ultimately adapt to new realities.\n\n\"Investors believe that ultimately, look, if three years from now you're going to be sitting on your desktop asking your desktop to generate code to do certain things for you, it's impossible to believe that there won't be benefits for customers removing some of the software,\" Adam Parker, the founder of Trivariate Research, said.\n\n\"I think it's just a manifestation of the worries that market participants have had for quite some time,\" Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone, added about Tuesday's big sell-off.\n\nYet, the latest weakness in the space is a continuation of what's been a year of weakness for software names.\n\nHere are three charts that show how striking the decline has been.\n\nSoftware stocks officially entered a bear market last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is now 27% from its September 2025 peak.\n\nThe price-to-earnings ratio, a traditional measure of stock valuations, has also dropped sharply among software makers' stocks. The P/E ratio in the S&P software index has dropped to below 60x, down from a peak of around 85x last summer.\n\nOracle, Varonis, CommVault, and Circle make up the group of the worst-performing stocks in the sector. All four stocks are down more than 50% from their September highs.\n\nThe outlook for software on Wall Street looks mixed after Tuesday's rout.\n\nPepperstone's Brown said he believes the bull case for tech broadly is still \"very, very robust,\" pointing to strong earnings and expectations for solid economic growth in the US. The S&P 500 is on track to post 12% earnings growth for the fourth quarter, which would mark its fifth straight period of double-digit growth, according to FactSet.\n\n\"I'm still very much in buy-the-dip mode,\" Brown said. \"Overall you are looking at a market where the path of least resistance leads higher.\"\n\nMost software stocks have more room to fall from a technical perspective, Piper Sandler's Johnson said. He pointed to the relative strength index, a technical gauge used to predict the near-term direction of stock prices, and said he believed most software names had at least 10%-20% more downside to go before finding a floor.\n\n\"CRM, ServiceNow, Oracle, DataDog, Snow, doesn't really matter,\" he said. \"They all have not pulled back or corrected to identifiable support levels.\"\n\nAdam Parker, the founder of Trivariate Research, said he believed software would be stuck in a \"guilty until proven innocent mode,\" with investors punishing companies until they saw stronger earnings growth.\n\n\"What the market's telling you is that the analyst estimates are way too high,\" he said of earnings. \"I feel like it's a falling knife that I don't want to catch personally.\"",

    "title": "10 appetizers that come out perfectly in an air fryer, according to chefs",
    "description": "According to professional chefs, nachos, bacon-wrapped dates, spring rolls, and garlic bread are some of the best appetizers to make in an air fryer.",
    "fullText": "According to Olivia Roszkowski, chef-instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education, the air fryer is great for making jalapeño poppers.\n\nShe said the appliance allows the exterior breading or batter to stay crunchy and golden while the cheesy center becomes \"molten\" without getting too stringy.\n\nWhen it comes to appetizers, mushrooms are often skipped over because they can lose water and become too soggy.\n\nHowever, both Christopher Lindsay — a chef-instructor at the University of Nevada — and Roszkowski love making stuffed mushrooms in the air fryer.\n\n\"Stuffed mushrooms are delicious when made in the air fryer because the mushrooms themselves do not lose too much volume, which often happens in a conventional or convection oven,\" Roszkowski told BI.\n\nLindsay recommends thoroughly cleaning and drying the mushrooms and lightly spraying the bottom of the air-fryer basket to prevent sticking.\n\nThen, the chef places the stuffed mushrooms inside, being careful to avoid overcrowding, and cooks the dish at 390 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit until the cheesy stuffing is golden and bubbly.\n\nUkoy is a crispy, comforting, fried Filipino fritter made with unpeeled shrimp, shredded vegetables, and a simple batter of cornstarch, flour, and water.\n\nGentile likes to make these fritters in the air fryer to skip the time it takes to deep-fry them. The chef said this dish could also be made without shrimp for a vegetarian alternative.\n\nRoszkowski told BI it's a good idea to make a dish like spinach-artichoke dip in the air fryer. She said this method takes about one-third of the time it would in the oven and still turns out golden and gooey.\n\nTo make the dip, Roszkowski suggests prepping it in an oven-safe ceramic dish. Then, cook the dip in the air fryer until golden and bubbling, and pair it with warm bread, pita chips, or sliced veggies.\n\nBacon-wrapped dates, a popular go-to appetizer for dinner parties and potlucks, are another great option for the air fryer. The appliance quickly crisps up the bacon while letting the cheese filling (if used) soften without burning.\n\n\"I've been perfecting bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with gorgonzola and a smoked almond in my convection oven for years, typically baking them for 25 to 30 minutes,\" Lindsay said.\n\nHowever, if you want to make the appetizer in a slightly shorter timeframe, the chef recommends preheating the air fryer for five minutes and baking the dates for 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nRoszkowski is all for going big on game day with freshly made nachos served with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream on the side.\n\n\"The tortilla chips don't get soggy because of the hot, dry circulating air and the quicker cooking time,\" Roszkowski said. \"This allows you to be generous with your toppings.\"\n\nThe chef also recommends lining the air fryer tray with parchment paper for easy cleanup.\n\nStore-bought puff pastry is arguably one of the most popular appetizer ingredients, especially for wrapped or rolled air-fryer dishes.\n\nLindsay likes to stuff puff pastry with chorizo, corn, red bell peppers, jalapeños, cotija cheese, and seasonings. Then, he folds the pastry and air-fries the dish until golden.\n\nHe serves the appetizer with fresh guacamole and salsa for a crowd-pleasing dish.\n\nIf you want an elevated appetizer that requires little prep time, Lindsay recommends covering a slab of Brie with pears or Cosmic Crisp apples cut batonnet style (into straight strips) and fresh thyme.\n\nThen, the chef rolls the ingredients into ham slices cut off the bone, places the dish seam-side down in the air fryer, and heats it up.",

    "description": "Microsoft's security boss Charlie Bell is moving to a new role as an individual contributor.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's security boss, Charlie Bell, is moving to a new role as an individual contributor, and the company hired Google executive Hayete Gallot to replace him, according to an internal memo from CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nGallot is a former Microsoft executive who joined Google in 2024 as president of customer experience for Google Cloud. Nadella called out Gallot's 15 years of experience at Microsoft in senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, and said Gallot was instrumental in the company's security business.\n\nBell, considered a key building of Amazon Web Services, joined Microsoft in 2021 to run a newly formed organization focused on cybersecurity. There was recent speculation inside Microsoft that Bell was preparing to retire. Bell's new role will be \"focused on engineering quality,\" according to the memo.\n\nMicrosoft has faced security challenges during Bell's tenure.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security in 2024, for example, condemned Microsoft for what it called \"a cascade of security failures\" that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers.\n\nMicrosoft, that same year, expanded what the company calls its Secure Future Initiative, making security the top priority for every employee, including adding security as a metric on which employees are evaluated during performance reviews.\n\nBell was expected to be a candidate to replace Andy Jassy when he took over as Amazon CEO for founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Instead, Jassy chose Adam Selipsky, who was previously AWS's de facto chief operating officer until he left in 2016 to become CEO of Tableau. Selipsky stepped down from that role in 2024.\n\nI am excited to share a couple updates in two of our core priorities: security and quality. Hayete Gallot is rejoining Microsoft as Executive Vice President, Security, reporting to me. I've also asked Charlie Bell to take on a new role focused on engineering quality, reporting to me.\n\nCharlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer. And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!\n\nHayete joins us from Google where she was President, Customer Experience for Google Cloud. Before that, she spent more than 15 years at Microsoft with senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, playing multiple critical roles in building two of our biggest franchises — Windows and Office, leading our commercial solution areas go to market efforts. And she was instrumental in the design and implementation of our Security Solution Area. She brings an ethos that combines product building with value realization for customers, which is critical right now.\n\nAs we shared during our quarterly earnings last week, we have great momentum in security, including progress with Security Copilot agents, strong Purview adoption, and continued customer growth, and we will build on this.\n\nWe have a deep bench of talent and leaders across our security business, and this team will now report to Hayete. Additionally, Ales Holecek will take on a new role as Chief Architect for Security, reporting to Hayete. Ales has spent years leading architecture and development across some of our most important platforms and will help bring that same sensibility to security and its connections back to our existing scale businesses and the Agent Platform.\n\nAs we shared yesterday, we have a new operating rhythm with commercial cohorts, and Hayete and her team will now be accountable for our security product rhythms as part of this process.\n\nCharlie built our Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management organization and helped rally the company behind the Secure Future Initiative. And we're fortunate to have his continued focus and leadership on another one of our top priorities. With our Quality Excellence Initiative, we have increased accountability and accelerated progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we always deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. And Charlie will partner closely with Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on this work.\n\nI'm excited to welcome Hayete back to Microsoft to advance this mission critical work, and grateful to Charlie for all he has done for our security business and what he will continue to do for the company.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "As someone who grew up in Alaska, I've met a lot of other Americans who are surprised about what my upbringing and lifestyle there were really like.",
    "fullText": "When I tell people that I was born and raised in Alaska, they almost always respond with a wide-eyed, \"Wow! What was that like?\" or a comment on how cold it must be there.\n\nI'm always surprised by how little people seem to know about my home state. I've been asked whether there really were 24 hours of darkness all winter, or if we used sled dogs to get around. When I was younger, other kids would ask if we lived in igloos.\n\nMisinformation aside, there are aspects of growing up in the Last Frontier that are unique in comparison to the rest of the US — many of which I didn't realize weren't the norm until I moved away as an adult.\n\nThe first time I headed out for a run during one of Alaska's all-too-common rainy days, my California-born husband was shocked. \"But it's raining!\" he said.\n\nI've learned that in other parts of the country, bad weather is a big deal. People generally avoid going out in the rain, and a snowstorm can bring entire cities to a halt.\n\nIn Alaska, however, it's business as usual, because if you wait for perfect weather, you might be waiting forever.\n\nWinters are long, sometimes upward of six months, and a snowstorm in April or May isn't unheard of. Summers offer almost 24 hours of daylight, and temperatures can hit nearly 80 degrees Fahrenheit, but they can also be extremely rainy, with weeks of drizzle and clouds.\n\nIf you want to enjoy outdoor activities, you learn to drive in it, dress for it, and embrace it.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are towns and villages in Alaska that can't be accessed by road. Much of the state is still quite wild, and there are regions that you can only get to by small plane.\n\nI come from a family of bush pilots who homesteaded here when it was still a territory and learned to fly at a young age.\n\nOwning a plane in Alaska isn't considered unusual, and in the summer months, the drone of Cessnas and Super Cubs serves as a backdrop to daily life.\n\nDespite living in one of the country's most remote states, most Alaskans tend to be well-traveled. My kids started racking up frequent flyer miles at an early age.\n\nWhen I left Alaska, I met a lot of people from the continental US who rarely left their home state — or, if and when they did travel, would drive rather than fly to their destination.\n\nBecause Alaska's size makes it difficult to hop in the car and drive to another state, flying is our default mode of transportation for domestic travel. We love to escape during the colder months, and many Alaskans\n\nI know spend lots of time in Hawaii, Southern California, and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAlthough Alaska's tourism is built on its wildlife and wilderness, visitors to larger cities like Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau will find a vibrant arts scene, five-star restaurants, and a wealth of cultural events and activities.\n\nAlaskans are a creative bunch, with the natural beauty around us serving as inspiration. We not only have robust local theater groups and art galleries, but also have performing arts centers that host touring shows and musical groups.\n\nAlaskan eateries offer a true farm-to-table experience, with many restaurants featuring seafood just pulled from the ocean that day and fresh, seasonal produce.\n\nAdd in Alaska's coffee-shop obsession, and you'll be shocked at how metropolitan a small Alaskan city can feel.\n\nAs beautiful as it is, Alaska is also deadly. Thanks to its remoteness, weather, and wildlife, most residents learn basic survival skills early on.\n\nAlaska kids grow up camping, hunting, and fishing — I know how to handle firearms, build a fire, and which berries are good to eat.\n\nMost drivers keep a set of jumper cables, a first-aid kit, and extra winter gear in their cars, and many homes have generators in case of power outages.\n\nI kept a go-bag in my closet at all times, full of emergency items and non-perishable food, in case of a catastrophic event that required a quick exit.\n\nThough I don't miss living in a place where it snows half the year, I'm proud that growing up in the far north left me with valuable skills I still use today.\n\nAlaska isn't for the faint of heart, but for me, it will always be home.",

    "fullText": "The most popular mom content tends to be rightwing tradwife propaganda or not political at all – pushing progressive creators out of the algorithm\n\nFor someone who doesn’t have a marble island in their kitchen I spend a disproportionate amount of time staring at marble kitchen islands, slack-jawed, brain turned half off. That’s because I consume a lot of videos from mommy bloggers, mom influencers, and the like. In kitchen “closing shift” videos, they wipe down their islands and reset by lighting luxury candles, the glow accentuating their respectable cosmetic procedures. Other times I watch them waltz through their morning routines: getting kids out the door, sweating it out in boutique fitness classes, showing off Amazon hauls, or explaining their children’s matching holiday photoshoot outfits.\n\nFor better or worse, this is how I have chosen to spend my one wild and precious life: consuming blissfully low-stakes motherhood content on my phone. It is domestically competent ASMR that also satiates my desire to peek into everyone’s bathroom cabinets. I nod in unsolicited approval as a TikTok mom I follow shares her green juice order. Fascinating. I should drink something like that. Another posts timestamps of her baby’s night-time sleep schedule. I, who lives between walls that have never heard the wail of an infant, ingurgitate the entire video.\n\nBut occasionally, when my cerebrum is not completely smoothed over by a beautiful woman beckoning me to “get ready” with her, an anxiety starts to creep in. What, I wonder, are this woman’s politics? Has she ever given us a hint? Is she registered to vote? Is there any chance she, like me, is outraged by ICE raids, book bans, our government’s comparatively dismal maternal support system or slippery slide into fascism? Does she know there are midterms this year? Mama, blink twice!\n\nIn my ideal algorithm, I would get served posts to assuage my doubts. I would watch nursery hauls of a mother whose progressiveness I did not doubt. I would know that she dreads the realities of the climate crisis. I would listen to a parent describe her weekly meal prep for a family of four and not wonder if she was politically aligned with the men in government stripping food safety regulations. Maybe tips on how to get your daily steps in with a newborn would include showing up at protests or delivering mutual aid groceries. Because in real life, I was raised by and hope to be a mother who is both fluent in the chaotic and comforting mundanity of domesticity and enraged by the systems that diminish and destroy families and livelihoods. I just don’t see that much of it in my online spheres.\n\nInstead, the most popular motherhood and lifestyle content lands somewhere on the short spectrum between conservative tradwife propaganda and extraordinarily apolitical, considering the paralyzing polycrisis we find ourselves in. I’m increasingly suspicious: was that sourdough starter “how to” video actually funded by the Church of Latter-day Saints? Hannah Neeleman AKA Ballerina Farm, one of the most-followed motherhood lifestyle content creators across platforms, has not ever explicitly divulged her political views – but do followers know she graced the cover of Evie magazine, described by one of its founders as “conservative Cosmo”?\n\n“The right in the United States has really won the family,” said content creator Kate Glavan. This past summer, Glavan posted a TikTok saying she would “happily watch ‘stay-at-home mom’ content if it emphasized the reality of being a mom in America”. More than 1,200 commenters chimed in on her video, captioned “We need leftist mommy blogger content”, in agreement. Some politely promoted their own accounts, or offered reasons they felt leftist mommy blogger content doesn’t lend itself to virality. “Leftist moms are often working,” one commenter wrote. “Every time I even HINT at my true political beliefs on here I get absolutely destroyed in my comments section,” wrote another. A number of people also expressed their unwillingness to put their children on camera due to privacy concerns and big-tech mistrust, which undoubtedly does not please the algorithmic gods.\n\nI asked Glavan, who does not have children of her own, what led her to make the video. “I don’t see enough examples of how I could do [motherhood] as someone who is left of center and advocates for certain politics,” she said. She believes that “being a mom is so political”, with the realities of motherhood in the US overwhelming even the twentysomething child-free influencer. “You are navigating through the healthcare system, you are probably not getting paid leave. You’re probably not getting any sort of benefits, the cost of diapers …” she lamented before trailing off.\n\nGlavan is pretty much right about, well, the right. The Venn diagram of anti-feminist Trump administration officials and hangers-on, and pronatalist enthusiasts – a movement concerned with women having more babies – has a worryingly chunky midsection. In an NBC poll from this past summer, women aged 18-29 who voted for Donald Trump in 2024 prioritized “having children” as a six out of 13 in their definition of personal success. Women of the same age who voted for Kamala Harris ranked it 12 of 13, prioritizing instead certain financial goals, community building and emotional stability.\n\nThe left’s skepticism or outright rejection of the traditional nuclear family – you know, white picket fence, two-and-a-half kids, general suburban phantasma – is not unique to this presidency. Throughout history, women’s domesticity has been held in tension against their autonomy. Marxist feminists in the 1970s demanded “family abolition”, arguing that the bourgeois family structure upholds the patriarchy and exploits wives as “instruments of production”. Around the same time, the grassroots campaigns Wages For Housework and Black Women for Wages for Housework aimed to raise the visibility of the economic contribution of women’s domestic labor, the latter movement asserting that welfare is a wage, not a charity.\n\nNo need to dive into complex social theory though, just visit any gift shop and pick up a magnet, greetings card or wine glass satirizing the lobotomized housewife and you will get the gist. But with motherhood content sitting at the crux of domestic life, gender politics, and consumerism (many creators aim to monetize views via sponsorships and paid product placement), it simply is not an ideal breeding ground for left-leaning thought leaders. (Though, could one argue that current-day monetization of the performance of labor in momfluencing is an extension of these mid-century feminist crusades? Perhaps!)\n\nMust I reckon with the reality that good politics and pilates arms routines might be at odds with one another? Motherhood content can and is often aesthetically aspirational, but can it also be ideologically so?\n\nIf you buck the algorithm and go searching, you will find creators whose identities fall outside the cookie cutter content farms both in makeup – queer moms, solo moms by choice, blended families – and substance. Moms who focus on gender-imbalanced workloads, like She Is A Paige Turner, or how special needs parenting is impacted by politics, like Eres_rara, or the dissonance of parenting at a time when ICE is separating children from their families and communities, like Bri motherhood. YouTuber Tiffany Ferg has a vlog titled: Why Motherhood Should Radicalize You. It’s all informative, it’s engaging, and it doesn’t quite scratch the itch because it can feel more like a lecture (albeit one I fully endorse) than the habitual mom content I tend to seek out.\n\nEarly attempts to ideologically curate my feeds and rid them of conservative-coded creators also led me to following mothers who romanticize their humble, though devotedly aesthetic, homes and natural fiber-forward lifestyles in back-to-the-earth settings like Mendocino or mid-coast Maine. But I was hoodwinked by their Democratic zip codes and unkempt curtain bangs. Handsome walnut cutting boards might have replaced antiseptic marble islands, but I was also increasingly watching haul videos not of Costco-sized tubs of Tylenol but raw milk to treat preventable illness. What did I expect? It’s Maha-mania out there, and mom influencers are all in.\n\nAround the time I watched Glavan’s video, I also watched a TikTok in which fashion and trend analyst Mandy Lee felt the need to clarify to her followers that her preconception health journey, which she chose to discuss online, was not going to lead her down the Maha or “alt-right” pipeline. Later she clarified she planned to rely on “real science, not Facebook science” in her fertility journey. She did not want to risk that wanting “a child and to have a family would make people assume that [she is] conservative”, which “could not be further from the truth”.\n\nHer disclaimers reminded me of another motherhood movement turned toxic: the forum Mumsnet, which provided moms in the UK with community and support but quickly veered into anti-trans rhetoric and Terfiness.\n\nLast year, motherhood and lifestyle content creator Lisa Miller started incorporating her political beliefs into her videos, after making the move with her family of five from eastern Tennessee to Brooklyn. “With the climate of politics now and having this major platform that I do – really it’s not a major platform compared to some creators, but to me, it is – it’s so important for me to speak out on things that I’m passionate about and that matter,” she said. That wasn’t always the case. Miller was raised by a Mexican American mom with left-leaning views in Detroit before being put in foster care in conservative parts of Virginia. “I just learned very early on to keep my opinions to myself and I didn’t want conflict.”\n\nBut the idea of conflict became less daunting as she witnessed a handful of parenthood creators, such as New York dad Jose Rolon (whose bio pitches his content as “relatable parenting to all families”), seamlessly incorporate politics into their platforms. Between family vacation vlogs and his recaps of his kids’ sports games are videos endorsing Zohran Mamdani and calling on fellow Latino creators to speak up about ICE raids.\n\nNow Miller posts videos that begin with her saying: “Get ready with me to lose a bunch of followers,” in which she discusses her thoughts on gun violence, ICE raids and raising a child on the autism spectrum in RFK Jr’s America as she does her multistep makeup routine and fixes up her hair. I find the series to be an ingenious blend of comforting daily ritual – like your typical momfluencer video – and straightforward political candor. The itch – it’s scratched!\n\nMiller’s defiant stance is common among the minority of mom creators who are vocally left-leaning – an acknowledgment of the apolitical or conservative mommy content they’re competing against. Many will use meme formats to clarify that they are not a tradwife SAHM (stay at home mom) but a “household who believes in science and equal rights”-type SAHM. (Bread and crosses emojis indicate the former, microscopes and rainbow flags the latter.) I’ve also seen a number of videos along the lines of this one, which reads: “POV you’re a progressive mom trying to figure out someone’s [presumably a new mom friend’s] vibe.” (Another way to check a TikTok creator’s politics is to peek at who they’re digitally endorsing in the “reposts” tab.) I have scrolled past many that share a sentiment along the lines of “I might not get invited back to book club, but at least they know where I stand on Palestine.” Since federal agents shot and killed VA nurse Alex Pretti and mom of three, Renee Nicole Good, and detained five-year-old Liam Ramos in Minneapolis, my feed has seen an uptick in videos of moms, some self-proclaimed “wine moms”, posting about how they are engaging with their children or shielding them from the enormity of these indignities.\n\nIt’s corny, but there is some pride that comes with being a conscious content consumer. “When you find out that someone is not a Trump supporter, you’re like, ‘OK, now I trust you, and I want to support your paid brand deals and comment on them and say, get your bag,’” Glavan said. It goes two ways. For Miller, being clear where she stands politically has helped a new and appreciative audience find her. “I found it so freeing and really healing to find like-minded people,” she said. “It certainly was empowering to connect with a community that believes in things like human rights and equality and women’s rights and Black Lives Matter.”\n\nMiller, who has worked with a number of lifestyle brands popular among moms, hasn’t seen a dip in deals with them since sharing her political views. “I’m not using my platform in a negative way and I think that would be different if I were, you know, being negative or being ugly or being hateful,” she said.\n\nI know that watching “day in my life” routines, hoping they will reflect on ways to look out for your neighbors or speak out against the current administration, is sort of like hoping the NFL might pause the Super Bowl to meaningfully address violence against women. But occasionally, you stumble upon something close. And though it might not be aspirational the way a perfectly sliced toddler snack plate is, it is aspirational in the sense it showcases my reality: not only do motherhood and left-leaning outrage coexist, the former often informs the latter.\n\nTo loosely and lazily (my favorite way to scroll) bastardize Marxist theory, there might not be any ethical consumption under motherhood content, but there are certainly some creators I’m hoping “get their bag”.",

    "fullText": "Financing a $30,000 car at 7% over five years adds $4,500 in interest costs.\n\nThe top 10% of households control 67% of wealth while the bottom half holds 2.5%.\n\nInvestors rethink 'hands off' investing and decide to start making real money\n\nFinancial expert, radio personality and author Dave Ramsey has built an empire on bold, uncompromising advice. In recent commentary, he distilled decades of teaching into a single principle: The way you pay for things determines whether you stay poor, remain middle class or build wealth. Wealthy people ask \"How much?\" and pay upfront to avoid interest. The middle class fixates on monthly payments and credit card rewards. The poor turn to payday lenders, pawn shops and lottery tickets.\n\nThe statement simplifies a complex problem of observable behavior. Look at how you approach a purchase, and you'll see your financial trajectory. For readers drowning in car payments or carrying balances, the message feels uncomfortably accurate.\n\nThe core insight holds up. Financing everything through monthly payments locks you into a cycle of interest charges that compound over time. Borrowing costs have risen sharply since the pandemic, with the Fed's effective federal funds rate now in the range of 3.50% to 3.75%. Credit card debt has become particularly destructive; cards typically charge APRs of 18% to 25%, which can turn small purchases into long-term drains on wealth. This makes Ramsey's advice about avoiding interest charges more relevant than ever.\n\nA typical car purchase illustrates the cost. Finance a $30,000 vehicle at 7% over five years, and you'll pay roughly $4,500 in interest — money that could have built wealth instead. When this pattern repeats across major purchases throughout life, it creates the compounding effect that determines financial outcomes.\n\nFederal Reserve data reveals the stark result of these accumulated payment decisions. The top 10% of households control 67% of total wealth, while the bottom half holds just 2.5%. This massive disparity often comes down to decades of choosing between asking \"How much per month?\" versus \"How much does this actually cost?\"\n\nThis infographic illustrates Dave Ramsey's view on the \"single money mistake\" that prevents individuals from building wealth, contrasting the middle-class and wealthy mindsets and offering a clear three-step solution.\n\nRamsey's advice works best for those earning stable incomes who can redirect money from interest payments into savings and investments. The behavioral shift from \"Can I afford the payment?\" to \"Can I afford the total cost?\" forces discipline that builds wealth.",

Not just ones that adopt the aesthetic of Y2K gaming – think Crow Country or Fear the Spotlight’s deliberately retro PS1-style fuzzy polygons – but semi-autobiographical games specifically about the millennial experience. I’ve played three in the past year. Despelote is set in 2002 in Ecuador and is played through the eyes of a football-obsessed eight-year-old. The award-winning Consume Me is about being a teen girl battling disordered eating in the 00s. And this week I played a point-and-click adventure game about being a college student in the early 2000s.\n\nPerfect Tides: Station to Station is set in New York in 2003 – a year that is the epitome of nostalgia for the micro-generation that grew up without the internet but came of age online. It was before Facebook, before the smartphone, but firmly during the era of late-night forum browsing and instant-messenger conversations. The internet wasn’t yet a vector for mass communication, but it could still bring you together with other people who loved the things that you loved, people who read the same hipster blogs and liked the same bands. The protagonist, Mara, is a student and young writer who works in her college library.\n\nThe earnestness with which Perfect Tides presents the college experience – quoting full paragraphs from pretentious texts, awkward interactions with classmates, stilted phone calls with Mara’s boyfriend back home – predates the concept of cringe. A key difference between the millennial generation and that of gen Z is that millennials did not grow up curating an online image on social media, and therefore had a much lesser terror of being perceived. We’d put up entire albums of terrible, blurry photos from a single night out, write nonstop on LiveJournal, produce appalling juvenilia and then post it on fanfic or art forums.\n\nNaturally, we find this embarrassing now, as do the younger generation, who enjoy making fun of millennial cringe. But Perfect Tides takes place in a time where nobody was worried about being embarrassing online or, indeed, in person. It’s a time before “hipster” emerged as an insult. Mara inhales everything around her – an anarchist philosophy book, music and movies, everything she hears professors say in class, new relationships – and reading, talking to other characters, and writing essays deepens her understanding of these topics, opening up new avenues of conversation in turn. It’s a cute way of gamifying the process of expanding your intellectual and taste horizons. She’s at an age where every experience and idea is new.\n\nPerfect Tides shares an aesthetic with Consume Me. Each embrace the sometimes messy pixel-art of 90s computer adventure games – but Consume Me’s tone is comedic and satirical where Perfect Tides’ is earnest. Both, however, are part of a long tradition of coming-of-age stories that emerge from every generation that has had the luxury of education and a free-form young adulthood. “Emerging adulthood”, a phrase coined by psychologist Jeffrey Arnett in 2000, is a useful descriptor for this stage of life: the extended period of identity formation, distinct from adolescence, that usually happens between 18 and 29 in societies where it is economically possible and culturally permissible for young adults to pursue further education.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is an especially redolent and memorable period of life, which is why there are so very many novels, films and TV shows about young adulthood. Playing Perfect Tides reminded me of Douglas Coupland’s youth-memoir novel, Generation X, which was part of the cultural canon when I was a teenager. And it makes sense that the first generation to truly grow up with games – my generation – is now making sense of those experiences through creating games. The bildungsroman of the 1800s has become the autobiographical indie game of the 2020s.\n\nIt is the very specificity of Perfect Tides – the year, the setting, Mara herself – that makes it feel so human and personal. You don’t have to be part of a specific generation to appreciate that generation’s art: when I read autofiction set in the 1960s or the 80s, I learn something about what it felt like to be alive in that time. When I play these millennial autofiction games, I relate to them more closely – there are aspects of Mara’s young-adulthood experience that closely mirror my own – but I’m still learning something. By spending a little time in these fictionalised memories, I’m learning how someone else experienced those same formative years.\n\nLook, I just can’t face another capitalist-dystopia piece of media at the moment. So I’m going to have to save Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator for a little later in the year, when I’m feeling more resilient. In this strategy-game-meets-stock-market simulator, you bet your credits on the life outcomes of fictional alien babies, watching their lives play out in text alerts. This anticapitalist satirical offering is from the people at Strange Scaffold, a studio that has now made a profitable habit of turning tweet-length jokes into full games (see also Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion and An Airport for Aliens Run By Dogs).\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\n Estimated playtime: 1-3 hours\n\nSony has patented the idea of personalised AI podcasts hosted by characters from its games. I am equal parts horrified and darkly amused by the thought of PaRappa the Rapper reading out patch notes.\n\nUK game retailer GAME has died yet another death, reports the Game Business, having struggled since the early 2010s. Its last three shops will close, and most of its other operations have already wound down. It will continue to exist within Sports Direct and House of Fraser stores.\n\nI’m still not done thinking about Hollow Knight Silksong, so I enjoyed this article by Nicole Clark, on the new feminist games website Mothership, about the game’s unexpected compassion.\n\nBloomberg visited Obsidian – one of Microsoft’s most interesting developers – for this studio profile, in which its leaders talk about how they ended up releasing three games in 2025.\n\nAnd finally: my book about Nintendo is finally out this week in the US, and next week in the UK. I’m doing a bunch of launch events in Glasgow, Edinburgh, St Andrews, London and Brighton. I’d love to see you there – tickets are here.\n\nThere’s a reason that Wii Bowling remains my mum’s favourite game of all time | Dominik Diamond\n\nCairn – obsession, suffering and awe in a climbing game that hits exhausting new heights | ★★★★☆\n\nIron Lung – YouTuber Markiplier crash lands with big-screen sci-fi horror | ★★☆☆☆\n\nThis week’s question comes from reader Gavin:\n\n“Could you explain the current debate around physical game ownership v digital? And the grey area of buying a digital code in a physical box? I can’t imagine those codes will be collector’s items in 10 years’ time ...”\n\nOnce upon a time, all video games came on cassette tapes, discs or cartridges, usually in tragically damage-prone cardboard boxes, with paper manuals. Then, when digital downloads became practical, we had a choice: either you buy your game on a disc in a box, or you go for the convenience of a downloaded version that exists on your hard drive. Now, however, it is difficult or even impossible to buy many games in a physical format. And even when you do, the disc simply prompts a 50GB download, or the box contains nothing but a redeemable code.\n\nDigital downloads are preferable for the businesses that run the gaming industry, for two reasons. Firstly: there are no manufacturing, packaging and shipping costs. Secondly: Sony, Apple, Steam, Microsoft or Nintendo gets around a 30% cut of every game sold digitally on their platforms, which is essentially free money for them. At one point, game retailers had too much power for these platform holders to abandon physical games: too many copies of FIFA and COD were sold at branches of GAME. But now, with bricks-and-mortar game retail a vanishing business, digital downloads are the norm.\n\nDigital downloads are convenient for players, of course, but they also come with huge disadvantages. What you’re buying is a licence, which at some theoretical future point could expire or become unusable, rendering your games unplayable. You can’t sell on a digital code or transfer ownership. For this reason a lot of people still prefer physical media, of all kinds. And everybody hates code-in-a-box. It’s the worst of both worlds.\n\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com.",

The same AI tools that promise to enhance productivity can create predictable patterns of team dysfunction that mirror classic organizational behavior problems. Many leaders treat these issues as technology problems to be solved with better tools or training, rather than team effectiveness issues that require many of the principles we know work for human collaboration. Understanding human-AI team dynamics is crucial not only from an organizational theory and practice standpoint, but for preventing costly errors and the erosion of team trust.",

    "description": "Bitcoin crashes below $73,000 amid technical breakdown, altcoin selloff, and regulatory uncertainty wiping billions from crypto portfolios.",
    "fullText": "Crypto portfolios just took a gut punch. Bitcoin briefly crashed below $73,000 on Tuesday, hitting $72,900—its lowest point since November 2024—before clawing back to around $75,658. That 6% intraday nosedive wiped out another chunk of what’s already been a brutal year, with Bitcoin now down 16% year-to-date. If you’re feeling like you’re watching your digital gold turn to digital dust, you’re not alone.\n\nFunding rates hit extreme zones while support levels that seemed solid start looking like mirages.\n\nThe technical picture looks about as appetizing as gas station sushi. Funding rates on Binance entered what analysts call an “extreme zone,” signaling traders are piling into short positions faster than people abandoning Twitter for BlueSky. Key resistance now sits at $74,000, while support hovers somewhere between $69,000 and $72,800—levels that feel as reliable as a crypto influencer’s price predictions. Volatility is spiking after a year of relative calm, because apparently the market decided boring was overrated.\n\nEthereum and XRP investors discover that diversification doesn’t work when everything moves in lockstep.\n\nWhile Bitcoin nurses a 4% daily bruise, altcoins are getting absolutely demolished. Ethereum dropped 25% over the past week, with XRP down 17%—proving once again that “altcoin season” often means “altcoin suffering season.” The carnage stems from a perfect storm of geopolitical jitters, the U.S. government shutdown scrambling economic data releases, and regulatory uncertainty that has investors fleeing anything riskier than Treasury bills.\n\nAnalysts offer conflicting views on whether fundamentals can overcome technical breakdown.\n\nRob Hadick from Dragonfly Capital argues the pullback “doesn’t appear driven by any single factor” and points to strong fundamentals from stablecoins and tokenized assets. Meanwhile, Alex Thorn at Galaxy Digital warns Bitcoin “may continue to drift lower” toward the 200-week moving average near $58,000. That’s a 20% drop from current levels—the kind of distance that separates hopeful hodlers from actual capitulation. With supply gaps gaping between $70,000-$80,000, this correction might have more room to run than anyone wants to admit.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "fullText": "The grieving parents of a Texas girl who drowned during a scuba certification class have filed a lawsuit against two agencies alleging the child’s death was preventable.\n\nOn Aug. 16, 2025, 12-year-old Dylan Harrison attended a private open water class purchased by her parents from Scubatoys, a local dive-shop, according to FOX 4.\n\nWhen the family reportedly arrived at The Scuba Ranch, a scuba training take located in nearby Terrell, they were told their daughter would be placed in a group of seven students.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges the divemaster assured Dylan’s parents ahead of the class, telling them, \"I will not take my eyes off your daughter.\"\n\nCollege Freshman Died After Fraternity Hazing Led To 'Horrific' Abuse, Family Says\n\nAt the time of the class, Assistant Chief Deputy for the Collin County Sheriff’s Office William Armstrong was employed part-time as a scuba instructor, and had previously worked a full day as a deputy followed by a full overnight shift as a security officer at an investment firm, FOX 4 reported.\n\nAs Dylan and her 12-year-old swimming buddy entered the water, Armstrong allegedly did not check if Dylan was properly weighted, the lawsuit reportedly states.\n\nDylan was last seen alive when the class initially entered the water at 9:36 a.m. and resurfaced at 10:12 a.m. after a miscommunication with a student.\n\nCruise Ship Chaos Mounts As Deaths, Crimes On Board Shatter Illusions Of Safety At Sea, Experts Warn\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that emergency services were not called to the scene until about 15 minutes later.\n\n\"Based on the amount of air left in [Dylan’s] scuba tank on the surface before she went missing and the amount of air left in the tank when she was found, it can be surmised that [she] was alive and breathing off her tank for several minutes after she was last seen,\" the lawsuit revealed, according to FOX 4. \"During this time, [Dylan] was alone, in poor visibility, and unable to reach the surface.\"\n\nFollowing the incident, Armstrong resigned from his position with the Collin County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nFamily Of Brianna Aguilera Sues Over Alcohol Service Ahead Of Death\n\nThe 40-page lawsuit alleges Dylan’s death was preventable and the result of multiple failures after the industry turned a blind eye to safety concerns for several years.\n\nAttorneys for the Harrison family reportedly point to a 2017 video of a staff meeting, in which Scubatoy owner Joe Johnson allegedly made dismissive comments about the safety protocols within the company’s classes, FOX 4 reported.\n\n\"All I know is we've killed, what? 4 people? 5 people? And we've never even done a deposition,\"  Johnson said in the video. \"Our insurance company just settles. John Witherspoon says we can kill two people a year and ‘we are fine.’\"\n\nScubatoys, NAUI, PADI, the Scuba Ranch and the Harrison family’s attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. Fox News Digital was unable to immediately locate an attorney representing Armstrong.\n\nOriginal article",

You’ll be shipping end-to-end product and working directly with customers.\n\nWe want to profitably grow the world's consumer brands. That begins with helping them understand which marketing efforts are driving profitable growth.\n\n200+ consumer brands, including publicly traded companies, rely on Converge to check in on their marketing performance up to a dozen times a day. They drill down to figure out what's working and decide where to shift million-dollar marketing budgets.\n\nTo ship even more, we've raised $5.7M from some of the best investors, including Y Combinator, General Catalyst, and the founders of Posthog, Algolia, Shipbob, ...\n\nShip product fully end-to-end. All the way from designing the system and data models to building out the interface and polishing the experience.\n\nWe trust you to build the best solution to a customer's problem. We lead with context and give you full autonomy to design the solution. This means you'll need to build a deep understanding of the problem, obsess over the solution, and ship it.\n\nWork directly with customers. You'll talk to them, ship, get feedback, and iterate. There are no middlemen. This means you can move incredibly fast: you message a customer, create a PR, and can have it fixed within hours.\n\nSome examples of projects you could own:\n\nEffortless Slack conversations: Customers screenshot their Converge reports up to a dozen of times a day (!) to share with the rest of the company. Instead, they should be able to directly tag and message a teammate from any number in Converge and have this synced bidirectionally with Slack.\n\nCentralizing all growth efforts: Converge already centralizes all growth metrics, but the information explaining them is still scattered. We want overlay the context that actually explains trends like pricing updates, budget changes, and promo calendars.\n\nCreative analytics: All growth teams use a separate tool to iterate on ad creatives, but they would want to run this workflow on Converge. We should build a Creative Analytics product on top of our data.\n\nAI agents: We never wanted to jump on the AI train for the sake of hype. But now that we have the foundations in place, there's huge leverage in building agents that can help growth teams understand their data and act on it more quickly.\n\nWe're a team of just 4 engineers with serious traction (well beyond $1M ARR). Join us if you want to get rid of office politics and just take ownership to get a lot done.\n\nEven though you join early, this job comes with real engineering challenges. We process $4B in online orders annually, 20TB of data flows through Converge each month, and we've collected around 10B customer interactions to date.\n\nWhat you're shipping will actually get used. 50% of our customers use us daily (!), while this is only 13% for the average SaaS company. You will have an immediate impact.\n\nWe love working in-person. You'll like it here if you do too.\n\nIf you think you could be a founder, there's no better way to learn than to talk to customers and ship. That's what you'll be spending all of your time on. We obsess over the details and will share honest feedback.\n\nStrong experience working across the stack (4+ YOE). We work with React, Python, Postgres, and Clickhouse. Experience building data-intensive products or familiarity with Clickhouse is a plus.\n\nYou've previously built products or large features fully end-to-end.\n\nYou obsess over the quality of what you're building, both in UX and code.\n\nSalary: $175K - $240K + equity (0.6% - 0.85%).\n\nPrivate health, dental, and vision insurance.\n\nIntro call (30 min): We want to learn about your motivations to join Converge, determine why you’d be a great fit, and answer any questions you have for us.\n\nTechnical (1h): We work through a typical engineering problem we face at Converge.\n\nCulture (45 min): We dive into your past experiences to learn how you like to work and what motivates you.\n\nSuperday (1 day): Join us for a day to actually build something! You get to meet the team, we get to meet you, it's great. (fully paid)\n\n(*) This can all be done in 2 days. If you want to move quickly, we do too. Our founding engineer was on a plane to meet us just days after our first call.",

According to CNN, Darden also owns Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, and half of the closing Breeze locations will be converted into other restaurants in the chain.\n\nCNN noted that the sad announcement for fans of the restaurant comes a year after Darden first shut down a third of its locations.\n\nThe outlet reported that the final day of operation for 14 Bahama Breeze locations will be April 5. The other 14 locations will be converted into other restaurants across the next 12-18 months, according to Darden.\n\n“The company believes the conversion locations are great sites that will benefit several of the brands in its portfolio,” Darden said. “Going forward, the primary focus will continue to be on supporting team members, including placing as many as possible in roles within the Darden portfolio.”\n\nDarden said it is not disclosing at this time what restaurants those locations will be converted into.\n\nThe list of closing Bahama Breeze locations includes two in Pennsylvania — one in King of Prussia and another in Pittsburgh. The other restaurants are located in Delaware, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.\n\nWhile it is the end of the road for Bahama Breeze, CNN reported that Darden’s stock is up 8% this year and that Oliver Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse have “reported positive same-store sales increases as consumers searched for value.”",

One Battle After Another plays it straight in its bracingly contemporary story of anti-fascist revolutionaries and immigration raids, while Sinners, Bugonia, and 28 Years Later use sci-fi and horror tropes to comment on our current political divides. If that all sounds too heavy, the list is rounded out by escapist fair like F1 and The Rip.\n\nAlso of note: The popularity of The Running Man and The Long Walk indicate that movie-goers are hungry for adaptations of dystopian Stephen King novels written under the pen-name Richard Bachman and foregrounding near-future authoritarian societies in which deadly ambulation-based contests are popular. I wonder what that's about?\n\nHere's the full list of the top 10 most-streamed movies of January 2026 across all major streaming services, as compiled by JustWatch.\n\nTopping the charts this month is Paul Thomas Anderson's nuanced, intelligent thriller about resistance and race in a fascistic, anti-immigration United States. (No, it's not a documentary.) Featuring fantastic performances from heavyweights like Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, and Regina Hall, One Battle After Another is that rare movie that's equal parts thoughtful and exciting. It was recently nominated for 13 Oscars. Stream one Battle After Another on HBO Max.\n\nIt's always nice when a weirdo movie is widely watched, and Bugonia was that movie in January 2026. Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis play a couple of societal dregs who kidnap a high-powered pharmaceutical executive (Emma Stone) because they think she's an alien. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, who helmed 2023's excellent Poor Things, the Best Picture Oscar nominee is a must-watch, even if you're only a little weird. (And if you want more weirdness, it's based on an even odder South Korean film called Save the Green Planet.) Stream Bugonia on Peacock.\n\nThis one-of-kind flick mashes up so many styles, it's practically its own genre. A historical-horror-ensemble romance-drama-comedy-musical exploring race and historical prejudice in the United States, Sinners tells its story through both song and vampire violence. It is absolutely to-notch in every cinematic way, which is probably why it earned a record 16 Oscar nominations. Stream Sinners on HBO Max and Prime Video.\n\nBased on a 1982 novel by Stephen King (writing as Richard Bachman) and directed by Edgar Wright, The Running Man is a dystopian near-future sci-fi action flick in which the most popular show on TV is a deadly reality competition with contestants who must survive 30 days while being hunted by professional assassins. I hate to admit that I would totally watch that show, and you should totally watch this movie. Stream The Running Man on MGM+ and Paramount+.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a throwback action-thriller, check out The Rip, from director Joe Carnahan. It tells the story of a Miami tactical narcotics team that discovers $20 million of dirty money in a stash house. Nobody in the squad is a \"clean cop\" when there's that much money in play, and soon, everything goes predictably haywire in unpredictable ways. Starring movie pals Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, The Rip is a non-stop ride. Stream The Rip on Netflix.\n\nIf you want maximum Americana drama, but not in a cheesy way, check out Train Dreams. Set in the early 1900s, it tells the story of Robert Grainier (Joel Edgerton), a logger and railroad builder whose quiet life is upended by a devastating tragedy. Train Dreams is a thoughtful, poetic movie about the passing of an era. It's also a Best Picture nominee this year. Stream Train Dreams on Netflix.\n\nThe third Knives Out mystery stars Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, the last of the gentleman's sleuths, who is this time investigating the murder of a priest. A stylish, twisty, brain-testing whodunnit with an all-star cast that includes Josh O'Connor, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Mila Kunis, and Jeremy Renner, Wake Up Dead Man is proof that a classic murder mystery can still keep the most seasoned armchair detectives guessing. Stream Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery on Netflix.\n\nThe second film in this month's top 10 based on a novel by Stephen King but written under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, The Long Walk shares only surface similarities with The Running Man in its story of a group of young men living in a dystopian future society who are forced to compete in a deadly contest that requires them to keep walking until only one of them is left standing (and alive). It's an ensemble character study closer to They Shoot Horses, Don't They than it is to over-the-top action sci-fi of The Running Man. (They'd make a great double-feature, though.) Stream The Long Walk on Starz or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nZombies spoil if you leave 'em out to long, and these dead boys have been marinating for nearly 30 years. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's 28 Years Later ditches much of the fast-paced chaos of modern zombie flicks for an atmospheric, haunting exploration of the community of humans still alive in a long-dead England. It’s a somber movie about the post-apocalypse that makes you wonder if the zombies have it better off. Stream 28 Years Later on Netflix or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nI'm happy that this list of bleak zombie narratives, carefully paced mysteries, and thinly veiled cultural critique ends with a movie about cars driving very, very fast. (Sometimes you just need a palate cleanser.) Starring Brad Pitt as race car driver striving for one last stab at glory, the Best Picture-nominated F1 was shot at actual F1 Grand Prix events and perfectly captures the danger, drama, and pure adrenaline of the sport. It's a great film to show off your new TV and soundbar. Stream F1: The Movie on Apple TV+.",

    "title": "These Switch 2 'Joy-Cons' Turn Your Handheld Into a Portable GameCube",
    "description": "Abxylute just announced GameCube-inspired \"Joy-Cons\" for the Switch 2.",
    "fullText": "For me, third-party \"Joy-Cons\" were an absolute necessity for comfortable portable play on the original Switch. But because the Switch 2 upgraded its Joy-Cons to a more complicated magnetic connection, we haven't seen many third-party options come out for it yet. It hasn't been as much of an issue for me as on the original Switch, since I do think the Joy-Con 2 are more comfortable than the original Joy-Cons. But they're still not ideal, especially when compared to other portable gaming options like the Steam Deck.\n\nThat's why controller company Abxylute's recent announcement is so interesting to me. The company announced on Tuesday that it will soon launch Kickstarters for two different portable controller options for the Nintendo Switch 2, both of which use a novel solution. Instead of sliding onto the console's sides like the Joy-Cons, these are instead shells you slide the console itself into. Just plug your console into the USB-C dock at the bottom of the shell, and you'll get a wired connection to the controller halves that sit on either side of the shell, while still being able to use the system's built-in screen. These Joy-Con 2 alternatives offer gamer a bit more grip, and, as a bonus, one of them also essentially turns your Switch 2 into a portable GameCube.\n\nPart of the fun of third-party Joy-Cons for the original Switch is that they took advantage of the console's modularity to offer wacky form factors. Take the NYXI Wizard, for example. This controller looked like a classic Nintendo GameCube WaveBird controller out of the box, but you could also take both halves of the controller off a central connector piece and slap them onto the sides of the original Switch for authentic portable Smash Bros. or Super Mario Sunshine gameplay. I missed seeing this kind of innovation on the Switch 2, especially since that system now offers even more GameCube games via Switch Online. Thankfully, though, Abxylute is picking up the slack.\n\nWhile its N6 portable controller is more traditional, its N9C is for retro gamers. It looks more like an original GameCube controller than a WaveBird, but it has the same familiar stick and button layout, and even has the right colors. There are modern niceties here, like home buttons and a more fully-featured D-Pad and right stick than on an actual GameCube controller. But this is shaping up to be the best way to play GameCube games on the Switch 2 on the go. The N6, meanwhile, has all the same features, but in a more common, Xbox 360 style layout, similar to the CRKD Nitro Deck 2.\n\nThere are also some power user features in the fine print, like drift-proof sticks (capacitive on the N9C and Hall effect on the N6), a gyroscope, optional macro buttons, and on the N9C, clicky micro-switch buttons. You could use either controller for any type of game, if you'd like. But it's really the GameCube form factor that's convincing me here. Yes, this design will likely be more comfortable than the Joy-Con 2, but it's also more fun.\n\nUnfortunately, because the Kickstarter campaigns for these have yet to launch, we don't yet know what they'll cost. Competitors like the Nitro Deck 2 cost $99, though, so you can probably expect to pay around that much. Abxylute's HandheldDIY J6 for the original Switch also costs $95 (when not on sale), which is another good barometer.\n\nThat's on the pricey end: My favorite third-party Joy-Cons for the original Switch only cost $50. But for the extra features here, plus the pricing on the competition, it's probably a cost I'd be willing to eat—especially because alternatives are still rare. The only third-party Switch 2 Joy-Cons you can buy right now that offer the same magnetic plug-and-play as the official ones are the NYXI Hyperion 3, and they have yet to be released and cost $126.99 (and they'll jump to $170 once early bird deals end). Abxylute's new reveals may not have that same satisfying snap-on tech, but they're feature-rich, and should still be a good upgrade over the official Joy-Con 2.",

    "description": "You don't have to manually enter your card info for every purchase.",
    "fullText": "A useful feature baked into iOS 26 is the ability to autofill credit cards stored in Apple Wallet across apps and browsers. If you don't use a password manager (which you absolutely should), AutoFill via Apple Wallet saves you the trouble of having to manually enter your credit card information every time you want to make a purchase on your phone. Even if you have a password manager, though, not all plans allow payment card storage and autofilling, and the feature can be clunky on those that do.\n\nAs 9to5Mac points out, AutoFill for credit cards was already available in Safari and is now supported systemwide, managed through Apple Wallet.\n\nFirst, you'll need to add your payment cards to Apple Wallet's autofill list (which is separate from your general wallet). Tap the three dots in the upper-right corner and select AutoFill. Tap Add Card to input card details manually or use the camera scan feature. The security code is optional, meaning you can add and store it in Apple Wallet AutoFill or enter it for each transaction.\n\nTo autofill saved credit cards, simply tap any form field to bring up the Paste/AutoFill option. Select AutoFill > Credit Card, authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, and tap the card you want to enter. You'll have to repeat the process for each field, as Apple Wallet won't autofill the whole form at once.",

    "title": "Tech stocks go into free fall as it dawns on traders that AI has the ability to cut revenues across the board",
    "description": "Tech companies are waking up to the fact that AI may be more likely to replace them than help them.",
    "fullText": "Until very recently, the narrative around AI was that the $600 billion of annual corporate capital expenditure (“capex”) fueling it was good for stocks in the short term. The companies receiving that money as new revenue (AI model makers, data center constructors, and the energy companies supplying them) would be the immediate beneficiaries. The efficiencies delivered by AI would be good for tech and non-tech companies alike. The Big Tech hyperscalers have always argued that the demand from their revenue-paying clients far exceeded their ability to supply AI services. \n\nThat narrative was turned on its head in the past 24 hours as it dawned on traders that AI also has the ability to reduce the revenues of a vast range of adjacent tech companies. \n\nThe argument—advanced by Palantir CEO Alex Karp and CTO Shyam Sankar on their recent earnings call—is that AI is now so good at writing or managing enterprise software that it threatens to make irrelevant a range of tech companies that have, for years, enjoyed recurring revenues by providing enterprise apps to companies on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) basis.\n\nHow is AI threatening traditional SaaS company revenues?\n\nWhich companies were most affected by yesterday's decline?\n\nWhat are Palantir's AI capabilities reducing migration times?\n\nWhat caused the $300 billion tech stock selloff?\n\nThat led to a widespread selloff of tech stocks, wiping away $300 billion in market cap in a single session.\n\nS&P 500 futures were flat this morning after closing down 0.84% last night.\n\nSaaS companies took major hits: Microsoft closed down 2.87%; SAP was down 3.29% this morning on the German market; Salesforce lost 6.85% yesterday and was further down in overnight trading; ServiceNow was down 6.97% yesterday and was marginally lower overnight also.\n\nPalantir’s Sankar said on the call that his company’s “AI forward deployed engineer” product—which allows clients to manage software and codebases through natural language commands—is able to reduce the time it takes to complete “complex SAP ERP migrations” from “years of work” to “as little as two weeks.” (ERP stands for “enterprise resource planning,” and it refers to a service offered by SAP around helping companies transition from aging legacy systems into new ones.)\n\nKarp added: “In the American market, we have inbound [requests from clients] where people have already seen proof points at other companies and not on one use case. [There is] a myriad of use cases.”\n\nJefferies analysts Akshat Agarwal and Ayush Bansal—who focus on Indian enterprise tech companies—published a note this morning arguing that AI has the ability to reduce the revenues of a wide range of tech companies:\n\n“Anthropic’s Cowork plug‑ins and Palantir’s claims of faster SAP migrations highlight how AI could potentially erode application service revenues for IT firms. With application services being 40% to 70% of revenues [for tech companies in India], IT firms face growth pressures. Consensus growth estimates don’t fully reflect this, posing downside risk to valuations,” they warned. Claude Cowork is like a general purpose work assistant that can organize tasks and files autonomously.",

    "description": "You can download lyrics for offline listening—if you pay.",
    "fullText": "Built-in lyrics are one of my favorite features of modern music streaming services. Back in ancient times, I had to google the lyrics to the songs I was listening to—which was fine if I was near a computer, but impossible when I was on the go with my iPod. This is probably why there are so many songs I think I know the words to, only to discover, once I read the actual lyrics, that I am sorely mistaken. Built-in lyrics are thus a feature that is equal parts useful and humbling.\n\nAs it happens, Spotify's existing lyrics features are getting some upgrades to kick off February. The company announced three key updates on Wednesday—two that impact free users, and one exclusive to Premium subscribers. Spotify might not offer Apple Music's dynamic lyrics, but these updates should still be welcomed by anyone who likes reading along to their music.\n\nThe biggest announcement of the day—in my opinion, anyway—is offline support for lyrics. This is always something that frustrates me whenever I'm using my phone without cellular service. Say I download some albums to listen to on a flight: When I try to listen to them in airplane mode, lyrics are unavailable. Being able to download the lyrics when you grab a song or album is a small but actually meaningful upgrade.\n\nUnfortunately, offline lyrics are not available free of charge: At this time, the feature is only available to Premium subscribers, which makes sense, given that free users can't download music for offline listening anyway—only podcasts.\n\nTraditionally, lyrics have appeared at the bottom of the player window in the Spotify app. To view them, you need to scroll down, then tap on the lyrics window to fully expand it. It seems Spotify wasn't content with this UI. The company says that in its testing, it finds that placing the lyrics directly below the album art, rather than below the player, makes them easier to interact with. And so that's where the lyrics are moving.\n\nThe company calls these \"lyrics previews,\" as you see just a snippet of the lyrics at one time. This change is rolling out to both free and Premium users on iOS and Android. If you'd rather not see the lyrics at all, you can tap the three-dot menu and choose \"Lyrics Off.\"\n\nSpotify is adamant that this new placement won't change lyric sharing. You'll still be able to send specific lyrics to friends and social media platforms. You'll just need to do so from the new lyrics window.\n\nSpotify's lyrics translation feature makes it easy to figure out what artists are singing about when you don't speak their particular language. When you listen to a song that doesn't match your device's system language, you'll find a translate button in the lyrics window. Tap that, and Spotify will include translations beneath each line of the song, so you can follow along.\n\nAccording to Spotify, this feature was available in more than 25 markets as of the end of last year, but now, the company is rolling out the feature worldwide.",

    "title": "You Can 'Remap' Your PC's Copilot Key to Do Something Actually Useful",
    "description": "Launch any app, or bring back the right ctrl key.",
    "fullText": "If you bought a Windows computer in the past couple years, there's a good chance that it a \"Copilot\" key where the right ctrl key used to be. But what if you actually used the right ctrl key? Or what if you prefer Claude or ChatGPT to Copilot? Whatever your reason for not loving the Copilot key, don't worry—you can change it. Here's how to do so in the Windows settings or, if necessary, using Microsoft Powertoys.\n\nOpen the Settings application and head to the Personalization section. You should find a Customize Copilot key option here, assuming you're using a recent-ish version of Windows 11. Click the drop-down menu and you'll have three options: Copilot, Search, and Custom. You can change the button to Search if you'd rather use the key to bring up the Windows search tool instead of Copilot.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the Custom option to launch any application on your computer instead of Copilot. This could be a useful way to open the Claude or ChatGPT desktop apps instead of Copilot. Or, if you're not a big AI fan, you could just have it open your browser.\n\nThis is a limited number of options, granted, but it's easy and doesn't require any sort of tools. It's your simplest option.\n\nYou may have noticed that the options in Settings don't let you remap the Copilot key to the ctrl key, or any other key—all you can do is launch an application. For that, you're going to need to install Powertoys, the secret Microsoft app that improves Windows.\n\nAfter installing, go to the Keyboard Manager section. The simplest thing to do, which may or may not work on your computer, is to click Remap keys. You should be able to press your Copilot key to remap it (it will show up as F23, which we'll get to). Now you can choose what you want the key to serve as. This could be ctrl, if you like, or it could be any other key. Click OK, and you should be done.\n\nThere's a chance this won't work for you. Why? Because the Copilot key works a little differently depending on what kind of laptop you have. Buckle up: This gets complicated in a very Microsoft-y way.\n\nOn many computers, the Copilot key functions as an F23 key. This is a workaround, of sorts, allowing Microsoft to add a key without changing the operating system very much. Most modern keyboards only have one row of function keys—around 12 in total. Keyboards in the 80's and 90's sometimes had two rows of keys—around 24 in total. Windows, to this day, still supports all 24 keys, even though basically no one has that many function keys. Microsoft took advantage of this—on many laptops the Copilot key functions as an F23 key.\n\nBut this is Windows, so of course it's more complicated than that. On some laptops, pressing the Copilot key triggers a keyboard shortcut: Windows-Shift-F23. This means you can't use the Remap keys function in Powertoys to remap the Copilot key, because the Copilot key already triggers a keyboard shortcut.\n\nWhat you can do is use the Remap a shortcut option. Use this, then press the Copilot key as your selection. You should see the keyboard shortcut Windows-Shift-F23 show up. Now choose what you want to remap your Copilot key to.\n\nThis works, with a caveat: You really can't use it to bring back your ctrl key, as users have noted on Github. The issue is that you can't remap a keyboard shortcut to a modifier key, just to a single keypress. It's not clear what could fix this, and I suspect users of such laptops are just stuck. Which is all to say that you might not be able to get your control key back, but least you can remap the key to do something else.",

    "title": "Messenger Apps Are Compressing Your Files, but There's a Workaround",
    "description": "Don't put up with sub-standard photos and videos in your apps.",
    "fullText": "In the old days, we'd post our photos and videos on social media for the world to see. Right now, it's far more common to send these pictures and clips to friends and family through private chat groups—but what you might not have realized is that they get pretty heavily compressed along the way.\n\nThere are many reasons for this: It means the files get sent faster, for example, and that the companies behind these messenger apps don't have to spend quite so much on cloud storage (imagine millions of images being sent by millions of users, all the time). However, the recipients of these photos and videos are missing out, and getting copies that are of a much lower quality.\n\nA lot of the time, you can't really tell the difference on a small phone screen, which is why apps can get away with it. But if you're looking at something on a computer screen or trying to print something out to get a permanent physical copy, the compression quickly becomes apparent. It's something most messenger apps do—but there is a workaround if you want your photos and videos shared at full resolution.\n\nMessenger apps are rather coy when it comes to revealing just how much compression they apply: Search the web and you'll hit Reddit threads and support forums rather than actual official documents. Apple admits iMessage applies compression \"when necessary\", and Google acknowledges files \"may have a lower resolution\" when sent through Google Chat, but it's all rather vague.\n\nTo try and get a bit more clarity, I ran a quick test myself, with a 12MP, 4,000 x 3,000 pixel, 3.4MB image taken on a Pixel. Bearing in mind that compression levels will vary depending on what you're sending, and this was just a test with a single image, here's how the file was changed after it got sent through various DMs:\n\nFacebook Messenger: 2,048 x 1,536 pixels, 392KB\n\nGoogle Chat: 1,600 x 1,200 pixels, 324KB\n\nGoogle Messenger: 4,000 x 3,000 pixels, 3.4MB.\n\niMessage: 4,000 x 3,000 pixels, 3.2MB\n\nInstagram: 1,000 x 750 pixels, 138KB\n\nWhatsApp: 2,000 x 1,500 pixels, 390KB\n\nYou can see there's a lot of compression going on here, but Google Messages and iMessage are the clear winners when it comes to retaining original quality (at least with images)—a good advert for both Apple's proprietary messaging system and for RCS.\n\nIt's also worth delving into the settings for each app. In Instagram, for example, there's a HD button next to the photo and video picker: When I selected this, Instagram shrank my original photo down to 2,000 x 1,500 pixels, with a file size of 421KB.\n\nIn its help section, Instagram says it automatically adjusts image compression based on current network conditions, which is something else to think about—you might want to do all your photo and video sharing over wifi (which is what I did here).\n\nYou can make sure your photos and videos get to your friends and family in their glorious, original quality, but you lose a bit of convenience along the way. Essentially, you need to pick a cloud storage service where your images and videos will be stored in full resolution, and then share links to these files—rather than sharing the files themselves.\n\nIt's not quite the same immediate experience if you're sending around baby pictures or party pictures: Your recipients will just see a rather dull-looking link instead of thumbnails right inside their apps (though in some cases, there might be a small preview attached). If quality is what matters most to you, this is the way to go when it comes to sharing photos and videos.\n\nYou're free to use your cloud storage provider of choice, but if there is one made by the same company behind your favorite messaging app, it makes sense to combine them together. In Google Photos on Android, for example, you can tap on a photo to view it, then choose Share and Share again to find the Create link feature: You can then share this link with any contact in any app.\n\nFor Apple Photos on the iPhone, you can get a link to a photo once you've opened it up by tapping the share button (lower left), then Copy iCloud Link. Again, you can paste this anywhere you like, and it's not much more difficult to share entire folders of pictures rather than individual images.\n\nThere is an extra advantage to sharing photos and videos this way, in that you can revoke sharing permissions any time you like: New people can be added and other people can be removed from albums showing your toddler growing up for example. It's not as fast and easy as direct file sharing, but you do get a bit more control (and higher resolutions).",

(KOIN) — If you want to take one last spin on the indoor ice rink at the Lloyd Center, you may want to get to it sooner rather than later.\n\nA new concert venue has been under construction at the site of the old Nordstrom store at the Lloyd Center. Now, KOIN 6 has learned that the plans to tear down the rest of that mall property are moving forward this week.\n\nThere were just a few people inside the Lloyd Center mall on Tuesday, as only a few stores are still open. When the mall opened in 1960, it was one of the largest in the country and was home to the first indoor mall skating rink in the U.S.\n\nResidents of Portland affordable housing complex speak out after ‘nightmare’ at ICE protest\n\n“It was a Portland icon. A piece of Portland history,” said Kerry Tymchuk, Executive Director of the Oregon Historical Society. “It was a showplace… It was part of Portland’s DNA for so many years.”\n\nDespite efforts to try and save the mall, current owners of the 29-acre property will present Portland’s Design Review Committee with their plans to tear it all down.\n\nThe plan is for thousands of housing units, offices, retail, streets and park spaces.\n\nStumptown Fil reveals winter prediction for the Pacific Northwest\n\n“It’s going to be a brand new neighborhood. We have a 30-acre site here. We’re envisioning new streets, new open spaces. There will be retail buildings. There will be thousands of units of new housing. It’s going to be a vibrant new neighborhood that takes shape here over the next 10 years or so,” said Tom Kilburn with Urban Renaissance Group.\n\nDemolition of the mall is expected sometime later this summer, and later this week, the owners of the Lloyd Center will go over their plans with the City of Portland.",

    "description": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said his team only sit seventh on net spend over the last five years. Is he right?",
    "fullText": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said he was \"a little bit grumpy\" when asked about the club's January transfer business.\n\nRather than concentrate on City being the biggest spenders for the second consecutive winter window, he preferred to focus on net spend.\n\n\"In net spend the last five years we are seventh,\" Guardiola insisted.\n\nIt appeared to be targeted at critics of his team's performances this season. The Spanish manager seemed to be arguing that others have been spending more money to catch up.\n\n\"They are facts,\" Guardiola added. \"Good luck to the six teams who are in front of us for net spend for the last five years.\"\n\nFigures from Footballtransfers.com show City are sixth, not seventh, with a net spend of £324.7m.\n\nBut let's be fair to Guardiola. He is effectively correct.\n\nNottingham Forest (£323m) pretty much have the same net spend despite being in the Championship for the first season of the calculation.\n\nBut is it as straightforward as this for City?\n\nThere are two ways of looking at things.\n\nYes, City are not the biggest net spenders.\n\nBut the data also shows they have spent the second most on players over this period.\n\nChelsea have spent the most (£1.57bn) to try to catch up with the likes of Manchester City. They have sold the most, too, with £862m worth of talent.\n\nGuardiola comes second on both: £962.3m spent with £637.6m brought in from sales.\n\nThis underlines how City have been incredibly adept at bringing through players from their academy and selling them for high transfer fees. In fact around £280m has been recouped in this way in the last five years.\n\nCole Palmer moved to Chelsea for £40.9m. James McAtee was signed by Forest in a £22.2m deal. Taylor Harwood-Bellis switched to Southampton for £20m.\n\nBetween them they made six Premier League starts for City, yet all three appear as pure profit as club-trained players.\n\nThis is not a criticism, though. It is exactly how an academy should operate.\n\nIf a player is not to the level of the first team, or has limited opportunities, then they should be sold. Rinse and repeat the process as the years pass.\n\nBut it could be construed as creating a slightly misleading picture in terms of net spend on the first team.\n\nChelsea have the same kind of model so it should be no surprise that their finances are along similar lines. It is just to slightly different levels.\n\nManchester United have the worst of all worlds: a high spend, a low return in transfers and disappointing results on the pitch.\n\nThe Red Devils are third in spending (£920.9m) but they have not come close to utilising the value of their academy, with player sales of just £246.6m.\n\nThat places them second in net spend (£674.3m).\n\nThis could also be said of Arsenal, who are third in net spend (£610.1m) but they have the lowest outgoing sales of the top clubs - just £184.2m.\n\nBut of course the Gunners sit clear at the top of the Premier League. Their incoming transfer business of £743.9m has been more effective than Manchester United's.\n\nHas the January transfer window always felt flat?\n\nThe talented playmaker no-one seems to want\n\nGrade A*? Grade F? Rate your club's transfer window after deadline day\n\nGuardiola mentioned five years, but what happens if we take a longer term view over the last decade?\n\nIt paints a very similar picture in spending on players.\n\nChelsea (£2.35bn) have spent the most, ahead of City (£1.82m) and Manchester United (£1.62bn).\n\nWhen we look at net spend the comparison gets worse for Manchester United, who have the highest net spend (£1.18bn).\n\nChelsea are in second (£993m), with Arsenal in third (£893.3m) and City (£890m) marginally behind in fourth.\n\nOn player sales only Chelsea (£1.36bn) have brought in more money than City (£934.6m).\n\nArsenal are again the worst performers on sales (£418.1m) ahead of Manchester United (£439m).\n\nYou can see why Guardiola would feel aggrieved.\n\nOver the last five and 10 years his team have consistently not been close to the top of the net spend table.\n\nBut when you are the only top club to be spending serious money in the January transfer window, it is a tough argument to win.\n\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page",

The deal came about after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured in a U.S. military operation on January 3.\n\n\"Venezuela ⁠has officially received all $500 ‌million from the first Venezuelan oil sale,\" the official said.\n\nThe official added that the money is to be \"disbursed ‍for the benefit of the Venezuelan people at the discretion of the U.S. government.\"\n\nLast week during testimony on Capitol Hill, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said ​U.S. involvement in the sale of Venezuelan oil was a short-term ‌effort aimed at stabilizing the country, keeping the government afloat and helping the people.\n\n\"So in essence, we allowed Venezuela to use their own oil to generate revenue to pay teachers and firefighters and police officers and keep the function of government operating so we didn’t have ⁠systemic collapse,\" he said.\n\nThe funds had been ​held in Qatar and intended as a \"temporary, ​short-term account to ensure Venezuela received the funds needed to operate,\" the U.S. official said.\n\nThe official added that the ‍long-term goal for ⁠future sales is to move the proceeds \"into a fund located in the U.S. and to authorize expenditures for any obligation or expense ⁠of the government of Venezuela or its agencies and instrumentalities upon instructions that ‌are consistent with agreed upon procedures.\"",

    "fullText": "Police have responded to claims that Savannah Guthrie’s brother-in-law, Tommaso Cioni, was a prime suspect in the disappearance of her mother, Nancy.\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department told TMZ on Feb. 4: “We have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case. Detectives continue to speak with anyone who may have had contact with Mrs. Guthrie. We are also awaiting additional forensic results.”\n\nSavannah Guthrie's Husband Feels 'Mostly Unhelpful' in Her Mom's Abduction Case as Officials Claim Her Pacemaker Issues Could Have 'Fatal' Consequences\n\nSavannah Guthrie & Her Today Co-Hosts Increase Security After Her Mom's Abduction as Officials Reveal if There Are Any Known Threats Against the Anchor\n\nThey added, “We are not confirming the car being seized, we are unsure where that reporter is getting that information.”\n\nRumors of Cioni’s involvement in the case began when former NewsNation host Ashleigh Banfield claimed that Savannah’s brother-in-law had been identified as a person of interest.\n\nAn additional statement from the Sheriff’s Department read, “While we appreciate the public’s concern, the sharing of unverified accusations or false information is irresponsible and does not assist the investigation.”\n\nTommaso Cioni is Annie Guthrie’s husband. The couple married in 2006, and they have one child together.\n\nAnnie was the last person to see Nancy, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos. “We have a start point,” Nanos told Us Weekly. “The family took her home from dinner at about 9:30 to 9:45 [p.m.]. So we would back that up to even say 9 or 8:30 p.m. to start looking.”\n\nThe sheriff also stated that there were no “red flags” about Nancy’s behavior before she disappeared. Nanos claimed that Nancy’s family members “weren’t alerted to her [missing] until about 11 in the morning” the following day, with police being called around 12:15 p.m. Authorities are currently investigating a timeline “anywhere from 9:30 p.m. to 11 [a.m.]” as the window of when Nancy went missing.\n\n“This is an 84-year-old lady who is safe in her own home asleep, and she is taken. That should never happen,” he continued. He also added that Nancy’s health is on the line since she’s currently on medication and emphasized that the results “can be fatal.”\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2026, Annie and Tommaso were spotted for the first time driving in their car, per photos from Page Six. The night before, TMZ revealed that they had an alleged ransom note demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin. “It’s like any piece of evidence,” Nanos told CBS News. “You give it to us, you give us a lead, we’re going to look at every aspect of that lead.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "fullText": "Heart of Midlothian manager Derek McInnes believes James Wilson has made a mistake by joining Tottenham Hotspur on loan in a deal that could be made permanent at the end of the season.\n\nArsenal were in talks with the Scottish Premiership leaders over a move for the 18-year-old but the Scotland striker joined Spurs instead.\n\nWilson, who became the youngest man to represent Scotland when he came on in their Nations League play-off tie against Greece last March, will play for Spurs' Under-21s side.\n\nHe has scored eight goals in 45 appearances since making his Hearts breakthrough last season but he has struggled for game time this term.\n\n\"James wanted to go, so you don't want to keep a player who then becomes unhappy,\" said McInnes.\n\n\"I couldn't guarantee him minutes, such is the way it's been. I told him and his agent that our preference was to stay, fight for his place, be part of something.\n\n\"We'd get him a loan in Scotland if need be, to top his minutes up, and we can maybe recall him - still get the best of both worlds.\n\nSpurs and Arsenal sign Scottish youngsters\n\n'Playing with fire' catches up with 10-man Hearts - McInnes\n\nPremiership leaders Hearts slip to defeat at St Mirren\n\n\"But his head was turned with the Tottenham thing. First it was Arsenal, then Arsenal went quiet, and then all of a sudden Tottenham came to the table.\n\n\"I don't think it's the right move for him. Ultimately, it's academy football and I think he's better than that. But it was something James wanted to do.\n\n\"I hope it goes well for him because he's a great kid. We'll see how it plays out. I just need to concentrate on the players who are here and who want to be here and play their part.\"\n\nHearts are top of the Premiership table but captain Lawrence Shankland's injury and Wilson's exit leaves McInnes with Pierre Landry Kabore and Elton Kabangu as his main strikers.\n\nVisit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Hearts news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Halle Berry told The Cut that she never heard from California governor Gavin Newsom despite him saying they would be “reconciling” their differences over his lack of support for the Menopause Care Equity Act and his previous veto of a similar bill.\n\n“It’s disturbing when people say they’re going to do things and then they don’t,” Berry told the publication. “But he heard what I said. If he is going to run to be our next president, he can’t sleep on women. Wake up, Gavin.”\n\nHalle Berry Won an Oscar and Says 'I Was Still Black the Next Morning' With Directors Refusing to Cast Her; She Later Advised Cynthia Erivo That Oscar Wins 'Cannot Be Validation'\n\nNicki Minaj and Gavin Newsom Feud Intensifies: Rapper Doubles Down on Slamming Governor's Trans Advocacy, as He Posts Diss Track\n\nNicki Minaj Says It's 'Impossible' For Gavin Newsom to Become President in 2028: 'He Thinks He's Tom Cruise'\n\nBerry’s beef with Newsom went public last December when she spoke candidly at the New York Times DealBook Summit about Newsom’s potential presidential run. The Oscar winner declared: “With the way he’s overlooked women, half the population, by devaluing us in midlife, he probably should not be the next president.”\n\n“[If men] had a medical condition that disrupted their sleep, brain function and sex life, we’d be calling that a health crisis on par with Covid, and the whole world would shut down,” Berry added, knocking Newsom for not supporting the Menopause Care Equity Act. “When women are struggling silently through perimenopause and menopause, trying to hold their families, careers, relationships and communities together, it doesn’t just affect women, it affects every household. It affects the workplace, it affects the economy. One in six women leave the workplace due to their menopausal symptoms. So it affects everybody.”\n\nThe bill Newsom did not support would have mandated comprehensive insurance coverage for medically necessary menopause and perimenopause treatments, required doctors to complete continuing education on menopause and directed the medical board to develop a continuing education curriculum.\n\n“I need every woman in this country to fight with me,” Berry said. “But the truth is, the fight isn’t just for us women. We need men too. We need all of the leaders, every single one of you in this room – this fight needs you. We need you to stay curious. We need you to ask questions. We need you to care even when the topic feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable.”\n\nNewsom told TMZ as Berry’s takedown of him went viral that “we’re reconciling this,” but Berry told The Cut she never heard from him.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom responded in December to Berry’s remarks, explaining his reasons for the veto by writing: “The Governor has deep admiration for Ms. Berry’s advocacy and looks forward to working with her and other stakeholders on this critical issue. He shares her goal of expanding access to menopause care that too many women struggle to get. He vetoed the bill because, as written, it would have unintentionally raised health care costs for millions of working women and working families already stretched thin — something he’s determined to avoid. We’re confident that by working together this year, we can expand access to essential menopause treatment while protecting women from higher bills.”\n\nIn regards to Berry’s latest comments to The Cut, a spokesperson for Newsom told The Independent: “Ms. Berry’s remarks are very unfortunate given the Governor’s proposal put forward to support menopause care through the state budget, just as he said he would do in his veto message on AB 432.”\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in February 2026",

He had the United Auto Workers Union's support, but even if he wasn't fired, would he even want to come back? That remains to be seen, but according to industry reporter Phoebe Wall Howard, the sources she's spoken with say Sabula's suspension has been lifted.\n\nIn a recent post on Substack, Howard reports her sources say that, not only is Sabula no longer suspended, he's also still \"a member of UAW Local 600 in Dearborn and employed by Ford.\" Whether he's already back on the job or still taking some time off isn't clear, though, and she was unable to reach Sabula to talk about his plans. Personally, I choose to believe he didn't return her call because he's on a beach somewhere, sipping cold, fruity drinks and not answering his phone, but that's more headcanon than a fact supported by evidence.\n\nWhen Howard contacted Ford for a statement, the representative declined, saying \"the company does not comment on personnel matters.\" Meanwhile, Laura Dickerson, a UAW vice president who oversees the union's Ford division, said the UAW still supports Sabula and has done its best to ensure he's treated fairly according to the terms of the contract, but she also said she couldn't comment further. That said, multiple unnamed sources reportedly told Howard that the contract Ford signed with the UAW would allow Sabula to take personal leave if he wanted to\n\nAs Howard points out, technically, Sabula was already on paid leave during his suspension while Ford tried to figure out what to do with him. Apparently, multiple sources \"...close to the situation\" told her that \"[a] secondary concern involved drama related to the employee's return to a politically diverse work environment,\" because \"[a] significant number of UAW members supported Trump on Election Day.\"\n\nWhether Sabula chooses to return to his job or not, the good news is, he shouldn't have to worry about money for a while. In response to Sabula showing more bravery than the supposed leaders of the Democratic Party, supporters started two separate GoFundMe campaigns to help Sabula out financially. Those GoFundMes ended up being so successful that, not only did they raise nearly $800,000, he also paused the campaigns and asked supporters to donate to other good causes.\n\nEven if Sabula doesn't plan to retire early in a foreign country with a low cost of living, after taxes, that's still a nice chunk of change that should give him plenty of options, including the ability to get more deeply involved in political organizing or advocacy. Personally, I'd probably take a nice, long vacation, buy a new Corvette, and then return to work, just to make everyone who supports the man who was best friends with Epstein uncomfortable, but I'm also petty and that may not be his style. Wherever Sabula goes, though, I hope he never has to pay for a single drink again.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "The men's T20 World Cup starts on Saturday against a backdrop of political tension.\n\nThe tournament, which features 20 teams, will be held in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nBangladesh are boycotting it after a request for their fixtures to be switched from India to Sri Lanka was refused by the sport's governing body.\n\nTheir place in Group C has been taken by Scotland.\n\nPakistan had considered boycotting but have since confirmed they will take part, though will not play their scheduled match against India.\n\nBangladesh had asked for their games to be switched from India, citing safety concerns amid growing tensions between the countries.\n\nRelations between the South Asian neighbours have soured since former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.\n\nIndia has not agreed to send her back despite several requests, and violent protests broke out after Sharif Osman Hadi - a prominent student leader in Bangladesh - was shot dead.\n\nIndia itself has raised concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nIn December, a Hindu man was accused of blasphemy and beaten to death by a mob in an incident that resulted in protests by Hindu nationalist groups in India.\n\nAgainst that political backdrop, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Kolkata Knight Riders released Bangladesh bowler Mustafizur Rahman in January after being instructed to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.\n\nIn response, Bangladeshi authorities banned broadcasts of the IPL in the country.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board then requested that their World Cup fixtures be played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe International Cricket Council - the sport's governing body - rejected that request, saying there was an \"absence of any credible security threat\" and gave the BCB a final 24 hours in which to declare their participation.\n\nWhen that deadline passed, Scotland were invited to the tournament.\n\nThe ICC said it was keen not to establish \"precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events\".\n\nPakistan are boycotting their match against India, which was scheduled to take place in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on 15 February.\n\nIn a statement, the Pakistan government said it granted \"approval\" to the team's participation in the tournament but they \"shall not take to the field\" for the match against India.\n\nPakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi previously said the team could pull out completely after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament.\n\nPakistan and India have not faced each other outside men's major tournaments since 2013, and India have not played in Pakistan since 2008.\n\nPakistan did not host any touring nations between 2009 and 2019 following the Lahore attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, which killed six policemen and two civilians.\n\nPakistani players have also been banned from the IPL since 2009 following the Mumbai attacks that left 174 people - including nine gunmen - dead.\n\nLast year India refused to travel to Pakistan to play in the Champions Trophy and eventually played their matches in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIt resulted in the two nations signing an agreement stating the two countries would play at neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.\n\nThe neighbours have fought a number of wars and had several military stand-offs since the partition of India in 1947, when the nation was split into India and the new state of Pakistan. It created an upsurge of violence, in which approximately 15 million people were displaced and an estimated one million died.\n\nRecent escalations were sparked after the neighbours engaged in a four-day military conflict in April 2025 following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.\n\nThe ICC said Pakistan's stance was \"difficult to reconcile\" and called on the country's cricket chiefs to explore a \"mutually acceptable resolution\".\n\nThe governing body said that \"selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions\".\n\nIt said it \"respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy\" but continued: \"This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan.\"\n\nIt added it hoped the PCB would \"consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country\".\n\nFormer Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi is among those who have accused the ICC of mishandling the situation.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: \"It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but I stand behind my government's decision.\n\n\"This is the moment for the ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member.\"\n\nMatches between Pakistan and India can draw huge TV audiences.\n\nReportedly, more than 600 million people watched last year's Champions Trophy fixture on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar.\n\nThe ICC has not published its playing conditions for the tournament so it is not known what sanction Pakistan could face.\n\nHowever, the rules for the previous tournament stated: \"If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as match conceded or match awarded, as the case may be.\"\n\nIt is assumed India will be awarded two points for a win and Pakistan's net run-rate will also be hit by the forfeiture.\n\nPakistan face the Netherlands, USA and Namibia in their other group-stage games, and it is unclear what could happen if they were to face India in the final.\n\nTeams have pulled out of tournament fixtures before, with Australia and the West Indies both deciding not to travel to Colombo in the 1996 World Cup that was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nEngland also decided not to play their 2003 World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns and social unrest in the country.\n\nNone of those nations received a subsequent fine or punishment from the ICC, though all forfeited the matches.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Bangladesh could receive other sanctions as the ICC has a precedent for punishing governments who interfere in the game.\n\nUnder article 2.4 of the ICC constitution, it outlines boards must manage their affairs \"autonomously and ensure that there is no government (or other public or quasi-public body) interference in its governance, regulation and/or administration of cricket\".\n\nIn 2019, Zimbabwe were suspended for three months after the government replaced the cricket board, leading to a freeze on funding and exclusion from World Cup qualifiers.\n\nFour years later, Sri Lanka also lost the right to host the Under-19 World Cup after its government dismissed the national board following poor performances.\n\nBoth nations later had their ICC membership restored.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nICC Men's T20 World Cup - everything you need to know\n\nWho owns the teams competing in The Hundred?\n\nWhat is the 'designated batters' rule introduced by Big Bash League?",

I was given a phone, and she asked if I would accept,\" said Fear.\n\n\"I immediately started crying, I had to find a wall so I could hide my emotions. I am so full of pride and it was difficult not to tell anyone, I'm such a chatterbox.\"\n\n\"I was doing some stretching in the gym, when Eve came up to me shyly,\" added Hall. \"I thought something would be wrong. It then flipped, to something that was an honour.\"\n\nHall is the most successful men's bobsleigh pilot in British history with 30 World Cup medals and is competing at his third Olympics.\n\nHe follows in the footsteps of fellow bobsledder Stuart Parkinson, who carried the flag for Team GB at the opening ceremony of the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nMeanwhile Fear becomes the first British ice dancer to bear the flag since Christopher Dean at Sarajevo 1984, where he won ice dance gold with Jayne Torvill.\n\nFear and partner Lewis Gibson are hoping to win Britain's first Olympic figure skating medal since Torvill and Dean earned bronze at Lillehammer 1994, having won World Championship bronze in 2025.\n\n\"I'll take those good vibes, I learned that statistic today,\" Fear said of Dean carrying the flag in 1984.\n\n\"They [Torvill and Dean] come up in conversation around us a lot, which is such a pinch me moment.\"\n\nFear said it was \"bittersweet\" to have the teams split up in different opening ceremonies but said it would represent the \"unity\" of Team GB across the villages.\n\nBoth are also in the unusual situation of competing in team events but carrying the flag on their own.\n\n\"It was received well by my team-mates, I think some of them knew I would be nominated,\" said Hall.\n\n\"Lewis is so proud of me, I represent both of us,\" added Fear. \"And it is exciting to represent skating.\"\n\nBeing the flagbearer represents a logistical issue for Fear, who will be competing on the morning of the ceremony in the opening day of the figure skating team event.\n\n\"It's going to be a long day, no way around that,\" she said. \"We compete around 10am, then we will cheer on team-mates.\n\n\"Then I might have an hour to sort my hair and make-up out!\"\n\nHall and Fear follow Muirhead and alpine skier Dave Ryding, who carried the flag at the opening ceremony of Beijing 2022, and both have asked Olympic medallist curler Muirhead for advice.\n\n\"I'm 5'2\" and not strong carrying things, I might have to visualise,\" said Fear with a laugh. \"I'm going to ask Eve functionally how to do it.\"\n\nClothes manufacturer Ben Sherman will outfit the full Team GB delegation for both the opening and closing ceremonies, while the flagbearers will wear hand-knit scarves and winter hats created by five-time summer Olympic medallist Tom Daley, who carried the flag at the Paris 2024 opening ceremony.\n\nGet to know the 2026 Team GB Winter Olympic squad\n\n2026 Winter Olympics daily guide\n\nQuiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics",

    "fullText": "Several Russian athletes approved to compete as neutrals at the Winter Olympics have links to activity supporting the war in Ukraine, according to evidence seen by BBC Sport.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has cleared 13 competitors, external from Russia to participate as Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs) in Milan-Cortina.\n\nTheir eligibility was assessed by a three-person IOC panel, external, with athletes deemed ineligible if they were found to have actively supported the war, including through social media activity or participation in pro-war events.\n\nHowever, material shared with the BBC by the Molfar Intelligence Institute, external and investigative journalist Artem Khudolieiev raises questions over whether some of those approved meet the IOC's broadly-framed criteria.\n\nMeanwhile, one member of the panel - Morinari Watanabe - was filmed embracing a Russian gymnast sanctioned for his involvement with Russia's war effort during a visit to Moscow in March, prompting further questions about the vetting process.\n\nUkraine's flag-bearer for the opening ceremony believes the IOC should review its neutral eligibility framework.\n\n\"Getting ready for competition in occupied territories, or supporting the war on social media, it is definitely not right to call them neutral because they're not,\" said skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych.\n\nThe IOC said it could not comment on individual cases but that the panel had \"reviewed the athletes in accordance with the executive board decision and the principles it had established\".\n\nRussians and Belarusians cleared for Winter Olympics\n\n'Russians & Belarusians should compete in qualifiers'\n\nBBC Sport has verified the following evidence relating to four individuals cleared to compete as neutrals:\n\nPetr Gumennik (figure skating) - Gumennik has recently worked with and been coached by Ilya Averbukh, who has been sanctioned by Ukraine, external. Averbukh has held the role of 'Crimea's ambassador for sport', taken part in events in numerous occupied territories and staged performances for families of Russian soldiers.\n\nSavelii Korostelev (cross-country skiing) - Korostelev liked pro-Putin and pro-military content posted on Instagram by fellow skier Veronika Stepanova. He was also described as a \"private\" and an \"army skier\" in a 2023 article published by his club, CSKA, which is affiliated with the Russian armed forces.\n\nKseniia Korzhova (speed skating) - Korzhova liked pro-war content on Instagram from gymnast Nikita Nagorny, who has been sanctioned by the UK, external and European Union, external for his prominent role with the Russian army.\n\nDariya Nepryaeva (cross-country skiing) - Nepryaeva attended a ski team training camp in Crimea in 2022, months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began. Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 and is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The camp was filmed and broadcast by a state-backed television channel.\n\nUkraine's Olympic Committee has written to the IOC to raise concerns about Gumennik and Korzhova.\n\nNone of the athletes named responded to BBC Sport's requests for comment.\n\nRussia's Sports Minister, Mikhail Degtyarev, has previously said that \"athletes are not responsible for relations between countries or for governmental decisions and according to the Olympic Charter they should have the right to compete\".\n\nSeparate reporting, external has suggested that Korostelev may have been completing compulsory military service, rather than voluntarily joining the army.\n\nThe final decision on whether the four athletes could compete in Milan-Cortina was taken by the IOC's Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel.\n\nWatanabe sits on the panel as the representative of international sports federations, by virtue of his role as president of World Gymnastics. He was also a candidate in last year's IOC presidential election.\n\nIn March 2025, Watanabe was filmed embracing Nagorny during a visit to Moscow.\n\nNagorny, an Olympic gold medallist at the Tokyo Games, has been a prominent supporter of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nHe served as head of Yunarmiya, Russia's youth military organisation, between 2020 and 2024 and has been sanctioned by the UK, European Union and United States, external.\n\nThe UK sanctions notice accuses Nagorny of involvement in the forced deportation and re-education of Ukrainian children.\n\n\"It’s crazy,\" said Heraskevych, who held up a ‘No War’ sign at the Beijing Games.\n\n\"He's still hugging this person and still friendly with him. And then he decides whether these Russians are guilty or not guilty, whether they are engaged in the war or not.\"\n\nWorld Gymnastics, responding on behalf of Watanabe, said it would not comment on the IOC panel or its decisions.\n\nIt said Watanabe's visit to Russia \"took place a few days after he visited Ukraine\" and that its purpose \"was to show support to athletes affected by the war, on both sides\".\n\n\"Mr Nagorny has not been allowed to participate in World Gymnastics competitions since the beginning of the conflict,\" it added.\n\nDuring Watanabe's tenure as head of World Gymnastics, Russian athletes have also been allowed to return to international competition under neutral status in his sport.\n\nThat includes Angelina Melnikova, who was controversially cleared to compete last year despite previously posing with the pro-war 'Z' symbol and standing in local elections for Vladimir Putin's United Russia party.\n\nWorld Gymnastics said decisions regarding its Individual Neutral Athlete status are made \"by an independent ad hoc committee, following background checks conducted by an external company\".\n\nRussia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began just four days after the end of the last Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nAt those Games, 209 Russians competed under the name of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) because of sanctions linked to a state-sponsored doping scandal. They finished second in the medal table, winning 32 medals including five gold.\n\nSince the invasion, athletes holding Russian or Belarusian passports have been barred from many international sports competitions.\n\nBut the IOC has created a pathway for individuals to compete as neutrals, provided they meet strict criteria.\n\nThat framework was first applied at Paris 2024, where 32 competitors from Russia and Belarus took part as AINs.\n\nTo be eligible, they had to show they had not actively supported the war and were not contracted to the military. They competed without national flags or anthems.\n\nThe same conditions apply in Milan-Cortina. Thirteen Russians and seven Belarusians have been approved across eight sports. Team events such as ice hockey and curling remain off limits.\n\nThe IOC says every neutral competitor must also be cleared by their international federation.\n\nSome bodies, including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), attempted to exclude neutrals altogether but that position was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in December, a ruling that came too late for many athletes to qualify.",

    "fullText": "Prop Ellis Genge says he is braced for Wales to take out their frustrations on England when the sides meet in their Six Nations openers on Saturday.\n\nWales have lost 20 of 22 Tests since the 2023 Rugby World Cup while a controversial restructuring of their domestic game continues in the background.\n\nTop players Jac Morgan, Dewi Lake and Aaron Wainwright have signed deals to join English clubs from next season, with team-mates such as Tomos Williams, Louis Rees-Zammit and Dafydd Jenkins already playing in the Prem.\n\nRugby Union Weekly: In Girona with England's centres & Genge\n\nSix Nations fixtures and how to follow on the BBC\n\nSix Nations preview & BBC pundit predictions\n\nBookmakers have Wales as rank outsiders for the fixture with odds of 28-1 available on the visitors to Allianz Stadium.\n\n\"Sometimes when there is a lot of stuff behind the scenes it can bring you together and, for them, there is no better fixture than England v Wales,\" Genge told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"Although there has been a bit of turmoil over the last 12 months and a lot of tough discussions behind the scenes, everyone knows that a Wales team who are a bit damaged, coming to Twickenham, is not going to be an easy game by any means.\"\n\nNew head coach Steve Tandy is coming into his first Six Nations with Wales, having previously overseen Scotland's defence.\n\nGenge believes a 73-0 thrashing by world champions South Africa at the end of his maiden autumn campaign has obscured some of the progress Wales have already made.\n\nThe fixture against the Springboks was staged outside World Rugby's window for international matches, meaning a clutch of first-choice players were on club duty outside Wales and unavailable to Tandy.\n\nGenge believes Wales' performance against New Zealand the week before, when they were within three points of the All Blacks on 50 minutes before fading to a 52-26 defeat, is a more accurate indicator of their form.\n\n\"You have got to pay them their respect. With a full outfit they were brilliant against New Zealand for 50 or 60 minutes, so they have definitely got it,\" he added.\n\n\"We will welcome it with open arms. I am sure they are beating the drum this week saying they need to do x, y and z, but we both know what it will be when we cross the line on Saturday.\"\n\nGenge starts at loose-head prop on Saturday, with Bevan Rodd backing him up on the replacements bench. However, injuries to fellow front-rowers Will Stuart, Asher Opoku-Fordjour and Fin Baxter have ushered some new faces into the wider England squad.\n\nBath's Vilikesa 'Billy' Sela and Northampton's Emmanuel Iyogun, both uncapped, have been called up for the Six Nations.\n\nTwenty-year-old Sela's rise has been especially rapid.\n\nHe was part of England's under-20 world title win in July 2024, but with South Africa's Thomas du Toit, Stuart and Wales' Archie Griffin all tight-head options at Bath, senior action has been hard to come by.\n\nSela has made three league starts and another two in the Investec Champions Cup this season.\n\nGenge, who made his debut as a 21-year-old against Wales in May 2016, says the new generation of front-row talent are better prepared for the Test game than he was.\n\n\"They are big lumps, not like when we were younger,\" he said.\n\n\"Billy is bigger than me I think - size 15 feet. All the youngsters who come in, they are young, but they are ready.\n\n\"I wasn't ready for Test match rugby until 23, 24, maybe a bit older if I am honest.\n\n\"Now the boys come in and they are huge, they are robust, their neck strength is there, they have played a lot of Prem rugby.\n\n\"In the front row you have to be a little bit gnarly and have that about you. It is tough to bring boys up to speed, but until they prove otherwise, for me they are definitely ready to play.\"\n\n'No bigger game' - Rees-Zammit on England v Wales rivalry\n\n'Niggly' Mann aims to get under England's skin\n\nPollock out to ruffle Six Nations feathers\n\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "Reigning world champion Luke Littler says Phil Taylor is the greatest darts player of all-time after being branded the best ever by Luke Humphries.",
    "fullText": "Reigning world champion and world number one Luke Littler says Phil Taylor is still the greatest darts player of all-time after Luke Humphries said the youngster deserved the title.\n\nLittler became the joint-third most successful player in the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) era of the sport by beating Humphries in the final of the Masters on Sunday night.\n\nIt led to 2024 world champion Humphries calling the 19-year-old \"the greatest darts player who has ever lived\", although Littler disagrees with that claim.\n\n\"It's really good to hear but I'm not one of those to go off and say 'yeah, I am the best' because I'm not the best,\" said Littler.\n\n\"Phil Taylor will always be the best, unless I somehow win more than him, and what he's done for the sport. So we can only see what happens in my career.\n\n\"Unless I go on and win 16 worlds and 16 Matchplays, or 17 then I'll get one over him then I'll be the best, but until someone breaks his records then he'll always be the best.\"\n\nLittler beats Humphries to win first World Masters\n\nWho is playing in Premier League Darts 2026 and what is the schedule?\n\nLittler's triumph at the Masters in Milton Keynes put him level with James Wade on 11 major PDC titles, behind only Michael van Gerwen who has 48 and 16-time world champion Taylor who has 79.\n\nAddressing his post-Masters comments at the 2026 Premier League launch, Humphries admitted he could have worded his praise of Littler differently.\n\n\"I said it in the moment, but I still stand by it, I'm not going to backtrack on it,\" said Humphries.\n\n\"Using the words 'the greatest', maybe what I meant to say was that he's the most talented player ever.\n\n\"Phil achieved so much, it's harsh not calling him the greatest, so maybe I used the wrong term, but I definitely stand by the fact that I think he's (Littler) the most talented darts player ever.\n\n\"Not just his ability to throw good darts, it's his temperament, his way of being so good under pressure, he has all of the credentials.\"\n\nGian van Veen - who lost to Littler in the 2026 World Championship final - feels Littler will continue to be the dominant force in darts for years to come.\n\nSpeaking ahead of his debut campaign in the Premier League, the Dutchman said: \"I think Luke Littler is still going to be on top of the world in five or 10 years.\n\n\"He's not unstoppable, but he's not shown too much signs of being stoppable.\"\n\nPremier League Darts 2026 fixtures, results and table\n\nLittler suggested influencer and close friend Angry Ginge will compete at qualifying school to earn a darts tour card in the future.\n\n\"I didn't go through Q-school, so I don't know what it's like to play in there, but I see some of the results every year when people are losing to 105 averages,\" said Littler.\n\n\"For Ginge himself, if he gets the luck of the draw, he could win a few games.\n\n\"But if he wants to do a few hours a day constantly, he'd obviously get better himself. We'll see him at Q-school one day.\"\n\nIt comes after two-time world champion Gary Anderson branded the involvement of certain influencers in darts as \"a load of rubbish\".\n\nSpeaking during the Masters, Anderson said: \"I don't [watch] YouTube, but I'm watching - what do you call them? - influencers. 'How to play darts' - I've never seen the bloke in my life.\n\n\"I've watched him play darts, he's absolutely rank at it, so why watch him?\n\n\"Who is he? They're actually pros and they actually know about darts, do they?\n\n\"It's a load of rubbish. So for young kids, it ain't good.\"\n\nBut Littler defended those who boast a significant social media following and are looking to make the crossover into darts.\n\n\"They're just trying aren't they,\" Littler said.\n\n\"They're trying to throw darts, trying to create a following and obviously most of them have got a few sponsors.\"",

    "title": "The F1, football and NFL figures who kept Epstein links after conviction",
    "description": "Senior figures in sport maintained personal contact with Jeffrey Epstein, while others were discussed regarding potential deals.",
    "fullText": "Senior executives in Formula 1, football and American football maintained their links with Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction for a sex offence, documents included in the latest Epstein files release show.\n\nMillions of new files relating to the notorious American financier were released last Friday.\n\nThey included emails and text messages between Epstein and some public figures who - before the files were released - claimed they had distanced themselves from him following his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nThe files also include documents that show discussions about potential business deals involving Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, and high-level sports executives.\n\nBeing named in the documents does not in itself indicate any wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to emails between Epstein and Jean Todt - the former president of motorsport governing body the FIA and team boss of Ferrari during the early 2000s - Todt visited Epstein at the latter's New York home in 2017.\n\nIn May of that year, Epstein emailed Todt to say \"jean, sorry it was so short and Terje did not give me any notice in advance to help with the fun\".\n\n'Terje' appears to be Norwegian diplomat Terje Rod-Larsen, who the files show was also in contact with Epstein, and sent a text message to the American saying: \"Think it could be useful for you to meet Jean Todt. Sent you his contact info. Call him and invite him for coffee.\"\n\nReplying to Epstein, Todt wrote: \"It was nice to get to know you through our common friend Terje. Let me know if you come to Paris or Geneva. I will be back in New York in mid-July.\"\n\nThe following day, Epstein sent an email to Eduardo Teodorani - now chairman and vice-president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for the UK - saying: \"i had jean todt to my house ? odd guy.\"\n\nTeodorani replied: \"Very. But why?\" No further replies are visible in the documents.\n\nTodt's name was first mentioned to Epstein in 2013, when another contact - French diplomat Olivier Colom - emailed him to say: \"Going out at Jean Todt tonight. Do you know him? I introduced Terje to him lately. Good man.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted Todt, who is now the United Nations' special envoy for road safety, for comment.\n\nFlavio Briatore - now executive adviser and de-facto team principal of the Alpine F1 team - also maintained contact with Epstein, according to the files.\n\nOne email from 2010, sent by a person whose identity is redacted, said: \"Flavio Briatore would like to speak with you. He can be reached at his office in London.\"\n\nLater the same year, Epstein referred to Briatore as \"my Italian friend\" in an email chain discussing the potential purchase of an aircraft by Mohamed Al Fayed - the late businessman who has been accused of multiple alleged rapes and attempted rapes.\n\nBriatore was also mentioned in a conversation between Epstein and Lord Mandelson - the former business secretary and US ambassador, who is facing an investigation into alleged misconduct in public office. The subject was a property in Chelsea, which Epstein was told Briatore wanted to sell.\n\nBBC Sport has approached Briatore's representative for comment.\n\nThe files show Crystal Palace investor Josh Harris remained in contact with Epstein via email and phone calls for many years after his conviction, including joining him for a breakfast meeting in 2013 after which he sent an email saying \"thank you for inviting me\".\n\nHarris - whose private equity firm Apollo Global Management also owns NBA team the Philadelphia 76ers, NHL team New Jersey Devils, and the NFL team Washington Commanders - also contacted Epstein in 2016, saying he was \"happy to catch up\" at some point in the future.\n\nA spokesperson for Harris said: \"Josh Harris never had an independent relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Harris sought to prevent Epstein's attempts to develop a corporate relationship with Apollo. As these emails indicate, Harris sought to avoid meeting with Epstein, cancelling meetings and having others return his calls.\"\n\nEmails sent to Epstein also appear to show he conducted two meetings with Todd Boehly - now co-owner and chairman of Chelsea - in 2011, three years after Epstein's conviction.\n\nThe emails suggest Epstein wanted to be introduced to Boehly, who at the time was co-owner of baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers, and a managing partner at global asset management firm Guggenheim Partners.\n\nNeither Boehly nor Chelsea have made a public comment.\n\nCeltic owner Dermot Desmond was mentioned twice in emails sent to Epstein in 2010 on behalf of golf resort developer Gerald G Barton.\n\nIn the messages, Epstein was told by somebody writing on behalf of Barton that Irish billionaire Desmond - a golf resort owner - was willing to provide millions of dollars to help co-fund golf developments.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Celtic for a response from Desmond.\n\nNew York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch repeatedly sent complimentary emails to Epstein in the early 2010s, and Epstein appeared to be attempting to arrange meetings between Tisch and women.\n\nIn one, in 2013, he told Tisch, \"I can bring the Russian if you like\".\n\nIn a statement, Tisch said: \"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments.\n\n\"I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"\n\nThe NFL says it is deliberating whether to conduct a formal investigation into Tisch.\n\n\"We are going to look at all the facts,\" said commissioner Roger Goodell when asked at a news conference about Tisch's conduct.\n\n\"We're going to look at the context of those [messages]. We're going to try to understand that and we'll look at how that falls under the policy,\" Goodell said.\n\nIn 2016, the billionaire property developer Andrew Farkas apologised on behalf of himself and Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross for the condition of the mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, that Epstein visited, and a year later Farkas told Epstein that Ross would be willing to provide up to $100m of funding for a project also part-funded by Epstein.\n\nBBC Sport has approached the Miami Dolphins for comment.\n\nThe files also include contact between sports figures and Ghislaine Maxwell - serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her role in Epstein's crimes - that took place before her former partner's conviction.\n\nCasey Wasserman - chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games and founder of marketing agency Wasserman - exchanged sexually charged emails with Maxwell in 2003.\n\nWasserman told her \"I miss you\", asked \"can I book that massage now?\" and requested to see Maxwell in \"a tight leather outfit\".\n\nWasserman's agency represents some of the most high-profile athletes in the world.\n\n\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" Wasserman said.\n\n\"I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"\n\nDavid Wassong, who - according to an online profile - advises entrepreneurs and businesses, sent a message to Maxwell in 2003 asking \"are you going to send me names and numbers of people to play with in Ireland?\"\n\nMaxwell replied with the phone number of former F1 driver Eddie Irvine. She also introduced Irvine to other acquaintances in the same year, according to emails.\n\nIrvine has previously admitted attending parties organised by Epstein and Maxwell in New York and Miami, and says he saw Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's accuser Virginia Giuffre at one event, but presumed she was about 20.\n\n\"I knew Ghislaine reasonably well,\" Irvine said in 2020. \"I spoke to her from time to time and I spoke to [Epstein] from time to time. Ghislaine was always super-sweet and a super-nice lady.\n\n\"When I was around, it was just a normal dinner, just parties. There'd just be a party where some people would turn up and some people wouldn't. But about that other stuff, I have no idea.\"",

    "description": "Scotland players tell BBC Sport their mental health suffered after they were told their contracts would end following the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland left the pitch following their gutsy 2025 Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat by England, for some of the squad it was a moment of pride that marked how far the team had come.\n\nFor others the full-time whistle signalled the end of an emotionally damaging tournament from which some say they are still struggling to recover.\n\nReaching the last eight was the team's best performance at a World Cup in 23 years.\n\nHowever, players have since told BBC Sport that behind the scenes Scottish Rugby's management of player contracts before the tournament left them in \"probably the worst case of mental health\" they had ever had, with one saying she suffered a breakdown as a result.\n\n\"I had an actual real-life breakdown in club to one of my coaches,\" she said.\n\n\"I've been put on medication for depression because of the impact that it's had on me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I came back from the World Cup in a hole, a shell of myself.\"\n\nIn response, Scottish Rugby said the union was \"aware of the potential challenges players faced in their mental health during this time\" and that a package of support was put in place.\n\n\"We would not question the personal experience of an individual athlete,\" the union's response continued.\n\n\"We would, however, dispute the lack of care referenced.\"\n\nBBC Sport spoke to four players involved in the World Cup and one who was in the wider Scotland training squad. Contributors wished to remain anonymous out of fear of jeopardising their future in the sport.\n\nPlayers said their contracts were due for renewal in June 2025, two months before the World Cup began in August, and that they had asked for 12-month deals beyond that to ensure job security and so they could focus on their performances at the tournament.\n\nHowever, according to those contacted, while some players in Scotland's 32-player World Cup squad were given 12-month contracts in May 2025, a quarter were told their deals would end in October, a decision one player described as a \"big shock\".\n\nAt the time, contracts ranged from £18,000 to £27,000 and in most cases were the player's main source of income. Those playing in the Premiership could also earn up to about £10,000 from their club contracts.\n\nThe players who spoke to BBC Sport said that having to compete at the World Cup knowing their jobs and international careers were potentially about to come to an end put them under huge mental strain.\n\nThey also said they were not given the proper support by Scottish Rugby to cope with the situation.\n\nSome of those who were told they would lose their funding after October had been part of the Scotland team for many years and were regularly starting international matches.\n\nOne said that \"despite clear signs\" that some were suffering with the news, \"no transitional help\" was offered by Scottish Rugby.\n\nAnother said she spent downtime between World Cup matches searching for a job.\n\nIn 2025 Scottish Rugby said it would increase the number of contracts available to players from 32 to 35 for the 2025-26 season.\n\nOne player said \"everybody understands contracts aren't going to be guaranteed every year\", before questioning why Scottish Rugby did not provide access to career advisors or psychologists for those affected.\n\nAnother added: \"It's not about contracts. It's not about resources. It's literally about treating people like human beings.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response stated that psychological support was embedded in Scotland camps and available to all players regardless of contract status.\n\nIt said a player development manager supported players on off-field matters, including employment, and that exit meetings were held at the end of contracts to identify any potential physical or psychological support that may be needed.\n\nAsked if she felt Scottish Rugby had failed in its duty of care to players, one player responded \"without a doubt\" and referenced the death of international Siobhan Cattigan aged 26 in 2021.\n\n\"How many people need to die before you take it seriously?\" she added, addressing Scottish Rugby. \"You've clearly not learned.\"\n\nCattigan's family said undetected rugby-related brain damage caused a \"catastrophic decline\" in her health and led to her death.\n\nIn 2023 Scottish Rugby said it \"let down\" Cattigan's family and chairman John McGuigan apologised \"wholeheartedly for any anguish we caused Siobhan during her time with Scottish Rugby\".\n\nMcGuigan added at the time: \"We have listened and heeded the lessons and, in Siobhan's memory, commit to making changes to ensure we are a better organisation in the future.\"\n\nAnother player said the communication of selection decisions left her \"unbelievably unwell\", adding: \"There are loads of harsh realities of elite sport: injury and non-selection. How you manage people is more important than ever.\n\n\"You can't treat people like they're just disposable, regardless of the elite sport wheel being a forever turning one.\n\n\"We still need to have empathy. And I just didn't feel like there was much at all.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response to this story said: \"We are very uncomfortable with this comparison to Siobhan's own tragic situation and the inference in any way that we were negligent in our support to her.\"\n\nPlayers told BBC Sport that the squad discussed boycotting one match during the 2025 Women's Six Nations - five months before the World Cup began - to try to reach a resolution with Scottish Rugby on its request for 12-month contracts.\n\nAll the players contacted say they were told contract decisions were based on performance and that they may still get a new contract should they perform well at the tournament, adding further pressure.\n\n\"It literally was a do or die lifeline,\" one player said.\n\n\"It's like I need to do everything I can on this rugby pitch, otherwise I'm not going to have a job and I'm going to struggle to pay my rent.\n\n\"When you're not sleeping, you don't have an appetite. You're just miserable most of the day. It's really hard to then put in a performance or do yourself justice.\"\n\nScottish Rugby's response said that players were told \"on a number of occasions that their standalone playing performance at the World cup was not the sole criteria for any possible change to their contract situation\".\n\nTold her contract would end in October, one player said she was on job search websites \"most nights\" during the tournament looking for jobs \"that were appropriate\" for her life as a club rugby player.\n\nShe said: \"Before you even started a job, you're trying to bargain and speak with a new employer and be like, 'Can I finish at this time?' Because I have to actually go to my other job [club rugby training].\n\n\"Then I'm going to come in tired in the morning because I've not got into bed until midnight.\"\n\nPlayers no longer on contracts can still represent Scotland, but they now fall under the country's National Team Agreement, which offers them £75 a day, not including rest days, for attending Scotland training camps.\n\nOne player said \"she can't be involved\" for that amount, adding: \"I won't be able to afford to pay my mortgage.\"\n\nAnother player said concerns over her future took \"an emotional toll\", adding: \"I didn't want to be there. I look back on it with exhaustion. It was such a big opportunity but I have nothing but negative thoughts around it.\n\n\"[After the tournament] I removed myself from social settings, any settings where people could ask me loads about rugby.\n\n\"If I did get into that environment, I would try to remove myself as quickly as possible because it made me panic and stress.\"\n\nThe player said Scotland Rugby had not been in contact about any follow-up support.\n\n\"There's been no kind of input about, 'do you need psychology?' or anything like that,\" she said.\n\nScottish Rugby detailed the steps put in place to support players:\n\nAccess to clinical psychology and a player development manager.\n\nA mandatory medical exit meeting to \"identify any potential physical or psychological support\".\n\nAn independent HR exit interview and a six-week post-contract window to access \"exit support services\" if needed.\n\nScottish Rugby said: \"From the outset of this process we recognised that players - particularly those whose contracts were due to end - would need additional support during the Rugby World Cup period and in planning their next steps.\n\n\"We believe we did deliver on our duty of care by the provision of both psychological and career guidance support throughout 2025, including in the lead-up to and during, the RWC.\n\n\"The entire playing group were out of contract in June 2025 and we made the decision to extend all contracts through to the end of October 2025 to provide a degree of stability through the RWC itself.\n\n\"The timings involved were designed to give clarity to all players as early as possible, following a timeline agreed and requested by the players themselves.\"\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - have been told their helmets do not meet safety standards only days out from the competition starting.\n\nThe British team have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for sport (Cas) after the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) said the helmets \"did not comply with the IBSF skeleton rules based on its shape\".\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) said the helmet was designed with safety in mind.\n\nThe team would currently not be able to wear the helmets in competition, but the Cas ruling will be heard on Thursday, with the result expected on Friday, before competition begins on 12 February.\n\nThe British skeleton team enjoyed a successful 2024-25 season, with Matt Weston winning overall World Cup gold and Marcus Wyatt silver, winning all seven races between them.\n\nThat success came using a different helmet, and the BBSA told BBC Sport the helmet it had hoped to use for the Games in Italy is a new design for the 2026-27 season, which begins towards the end of the year.\n\nIt said it has tried to be \"innovative\" with the new design, which it believes to \"be in the current rules\".\n\nIt said the new helmet has been designed to comply with new rules imposed by the IBSF for the 2026-27 season, which are aimed at improving safety, and that it is proven to be safer than any other helmets being used.\n\nThe rules set out the safety standards helmets must meet and have stipulations about the shape. For example, the helmet must not have any additionally attached aerodynamic elements.\n\nThe team wore the new helmets last week at a training session in Switzerland but have also brought the old helmets to Cortina.\n\nAt the 2010 Games the USA and Canada lodged a protest moments after British slider Amy Williams won the gold medal, alleging the small ridges on her helmet were illegal, but the protest was thrown out.\n\nAt the 2018 Games British medallists Lizzy Yarnold, Laura Deas and Dom Parsons wore specialised skin suits featuring drag-resistant ridges, the legality of which was also questioned by rival teams.\n\nWeston is the heavy favourite for the gold medal in Cortina, with the men's event beginning on 12 February and the women's on 13 February.\n\nLizzy Yarnold, two-time British skeleton Olympic champion\n\nThere will always be a different kit which is being worked on - whether it's the helmets, the sled, the suits itself - they will all go through a process of making sure that they abide by the rules and it's the best kit possible for the athletes.\n\nI think there's always likely to be noise around equipment. The British team wore this helmet in Switzerland last week, so it's not a hidden thing.\n\nBut the noise around it is almost very anticipated, because whenever you bring in new equipment it has to go through the process of being checked.\n\nWhether there is an element of gamesmanship having a new helmet, I don't think that is at play.\n\nI don't know whether the athletes will have a preference on which helmet they use but they know they are performing well and can still perform well with the old helmet.\n\nThey will be happy with all of the different versions of equipment, so their role is simply just focusing on the matter at hand.",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at Manchester City's evolution and why the January window has offered renewed belief.",
    "fullText": "The January transfer window has heralded encouragement at Manchester City.\n\nNot necessarily because Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi have strengthened their squad, but more that the marquee acquisitions show City are maintaining their powerbase in the transfer market.\n\nThe mere thought of transition can be enough to strike fear into any football club, particularly one that has been as successful as City in recent years.\n\nOld habits die hard when winning becomes the norm, but sometimes key decisions are taken out of your hands.\n\nAt the Etihad Stadium, there are clear signs of evolution.\n\nOn the pitch, a host of new players have arrived, while stalwarts Kevin de Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Ederson have left. In the executive team, long-serving sporting director Txiki Begiristain has departed and handed the reins to Hugo Viana.\n\nThen there's manager Pep Guardiola and the growing uncertainty over his future.\n\nIn attracting players, City have leaned heavily on the unique selling point of working with Guardiola. They can still use his aura to their advantage - but no longer to the same extent.\n\nHere, BBC Sport looks at the club's evolution and why the January window has offered renewed belief at City that change and ambiguity over their manager's future won't derail their efforts to deliver success.\n\nWhen Guardiola signed a new two-year contract in November 2024, the perceived doomsday scenario of his departure at the end of that season was prevented.\n\nAt the time, the club's greatest ever manager had just over six months left on his contract. Now there is no such urgency, with 18 months left on his deal.\n\nBut that doesn't tell the full story.\n\nThe football industry has been rife with speculation over Guardiola's future, though City's perspective is talk of him departing this year is just that - speculation.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it would be City's preference for him to stay for as long as possible. The 55-year-old continues to publicly insist he loves working at the club, and has shown no clear outward indication he is preparing to leave.\n\nBut sources have told BBC Sport there is tangible uncertainty over whether Guardiola will see out the final year of his contract.\n\nThe expectation is a decision on whether he stays will be made towards - or after - the end of this season.\n\nAnd if Guardiola does stay, it is seen as improbable that he will renew his contract.\n\nIt is fair, then, to deduce we are likely to be at the beginning of the end of his trophy-laden tenure in the blue half of Manchester.\n\nWhether that moment comes in six or 18 months remains to be seen.\n\nSemenyo and Guehi entered negotiations with their eyes open.\n\nBoth had the Premier League's elite to choose from last month.\n\nSemenyo was a target for Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham. Liverpool, too, were credited with an interest in the 26-year-old, who had a £65m release clause at Bournemouth. He prioritised a move to City.\n\nGuehi was admired on an even greater scale. Out of contract at Crystal Palace at the end of this season, the England defender had suitors across Europe.\n\nBayern Munich, Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid had serious interest in signing him on a free transfer at the end of the season, while Real Madrid and Barcelona were also in the running. Liverpool's interest was well-documented. Arsenal and Tottenham also tried to convince him to agree to move across London this summer.\n\nIt is inconceivable either player decided to sign a long-term contract without knowing it is likely the majority of that time will be spent under a manager who isn't Guardiola.\n\nOf course, the opportunity to work for him - even if it is for six months - is one most players aren't afforded. But that alone is unlikely to have been enough to compel Semenyo and Guehi to sign five-and-a-half-year deals.\n\nCity can no longer lean heavily on the idea of flourishing under Guardiola in their pitches to players.\n\nAccording to sources, rival club executives have used the emerging narrative over the managerial situation to persuade players to ignore advances from the Blues - as if to suggest their success will wane once Guardiola is gone.\n\nNevertheless - certainly for Semenyo and Guehi - City's pitch remains among the most competitive around, despite the uncertainty over Guardiola.\n\nThere is no escaping the fact they are one of the best payers in Europe, and it would be disingenuous to suggest finances weren't a big factor in the two new signings.\n\nThat said, it is understood Tottenham's offer to Semenyo was the most lucrative he received last month.\n\nIndeed, sources close to both transfers say it was City demonstrating they gave a virtual guarantee of competing for the biggest trophies and consistent Champions League qualification that proved pivotal in the decision-making process.\n\nTheir state-of-the-art infrastructure and off-field ambitions are key features of their pitch to new players, but ultimately it centres on on-field success.\n\nThey impress on prospective signings the world-class squad already assembled, combined with their commitment to continue recruiting elite players.\n\nTheir strategy of extending the contracts of their best talent in search of continuity and stability also features prominently in their pitch - the 10-year contract striker Erling Haaland signed last year a case in point.\n\nBut it is City's body of work under their Abu Dhabi ownership - even prior to Guardiola's arrival - that is their truly unique selling point for prospective signings.\n\nThe trophies speak for themselves.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't some uncertainties. The implications of City's prolonged legal battle over the much-documented 115 charges in relation to alleged Premier League financial rule breaches weighs heavily over the Etihad. The club strongly deny any wrongdoing.\n\nThe outcome of the case will resonate, and any punishment may alter the landscape of English football and City's history.\n\nWhile no-one knows where the case is up to, the rebuild City have carried out over the past year suggests they are not actively preparing for the worst.\n\nRegardless of what lies ahead in that respect, they will continue to prepare the football operation for success way beyond when Guardiola is gone.\n\nFor those at City, the arrivals of Semenyo and Guehi have provided tangible proof their recruitment operations are not dependent on Guardiola's employment.\n\nAmid the ongoing changes, there remains a key constant at City.\n\nChairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak is the club's agenda-setter. The idea the Spanish triumvirate of Guardiola, Begiristain and Ferran Soriano - the club's CEO - ran the show in the absence of a distant Al Mubarak is a false narrative.\n\nHe has been, and remains, at the heart of City's operation. No big decisions are made without his input.\n\nTo that end, Al Mubarak will be at the centre of the process to appoint Guardiola's eventual replacement. Viana will lead the search - a task that will unquestionably be his most significant since his appointment as Begiristain's replacement was confirmed in October 2024.\n\nFor the successful candidate, replacing Guardiola will be an unenviable task.\n\nThat said, replacing Begiristain may have been just as daunting for Viana given his predecessor's reputation as one of the leading player-trading executives in world football.\n\nWith that in mind, those at City will tell you the move to keep Begiristain to conduct what was effectively a six-month handover to Viana until the summer of 2025 was crucial in the Portuguese's ability to hit the ground running.\n\nAccording to sources, Begiristain hand-picked Viana as his successor - a dynamic that eased the transition.\n\nThat Ruben Amorim - as manager of Manchester United - was also in town helped.\n\nThe pair - and their wives - grew close during their time working together at Sporting Lisbon, where Viana and Amorim had become two of the most sought-after non-playing commodities in European football.\n\nViana's track record at Sporting was excellent. Alongside Amorim, who he appointed, the 43-year-old helped transform them from a team stuck in malaise into one of the most dynamic in European football.\n\nThe signings of Viktor Gyokeres, Morten Hjulmand and Pedro Porro were viewed in recruitment circles as among the most economically sound.\n\nHe also sold Porro, Matheus Nunes, Joao Palhinha, Nuno Mendes and Manuel Ugarte for combined fees of more than 200m euros (£170m).\n\nOf course, City are a different beast.\n\nBegiristain and Viana worked in tandem during the 2025 January window in signing Nico Gonzalez, Abdukodir Khusanov and Omar Marmoush - something seen as hugely important in Viana's development.\n\nSimilarly, the groundwork for City's £20m capture of Guehi was started by Begiristain but executed by Viana, who is asserting his authority and personality on the club.\n\nBegiristain, Guardiola and Soriano are very close, but Viana is forging relationships with the latter two - and they are already said to be on a strong footing.\n\nThose who have worked under both Viana and Begiristain speak of similarities between them: they are unassuming in their demeanour but diligent and structured in the way they operate.\n\n\"There is a plan for everything,\" said a source.\n\nAgents have also spoken positively of their dealings with Viana, describing him as straightforward and courteous.\n\nViana is now two transfer windows into the rebuild of City's squad.\n\nDe Bruyne, Ederson and Walker all departed on his watch, and fellow stalwarts John Stones and Bernardo Silva could leave when their contracts expire in the summer.\n\nThere is uncertainty, too, over the future of Nathan Ake - and the same could be said for Manuel Akanji, Jack Grealish and Kalvin Phillips, who are all out on loan.\n\nIt is gearing up to be a busy summer window for Viana, something made trickier by it being a World Cup year.\n\nLast summer, he didn't have it all his own way. City had genuine interest in Florian Wirtz, who eventually went to Liverpool, but felt compelled to drop out of the running for the German over the total cost of the deal.\n\nWhile City maintain it was their decision, the fact they didn't sign Wirtz was felt deeply given how highly they rated the player.\n\nViana pivoted to a more economical option - Rayan Cherki, who has been a bright spark in City's season.\n\nWirtz appears to be finding his feet in England, but City will argue Cherki has had the more impressive campaign so far.\n\nThe signings of goalkeepers Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford - after Ederson's departure - were two key acquisitions, with the former's arrival seen as particularly important. Tijjani Reijnders and full-back Rayan Ait-Nouri were also important arrivals.\n\nViana will now target a new central midfielder, with Nottingham Forest's Elliott Anderson among the primary targets.\n\nThey will want further defensive reinforcements too should Stones and Ake depart, though there remain high hopes for central defender Vitor Reis - on loan at sister club Girona - with the expectation he will be integrated into City's senior squad in the not-too-distant future.\n\nWith Viana at the controls, City's transition is in full swing - and their ambitions are no longer contingent on the presence of their iconic manager.\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "According to a report from AS, Ferland Mendy is entering the final stage of his recovery, and his return to action for Real Madrid now appears close.\n\nWhile the physical outlook is encouraging, the outlet mentions that questions remain over how Alvaro Arbeloa plans to use the defender once he is fully fit.\n\nWithin the club, the main objective is to avoid any kind of relapse, as after a difficult spell on the sidelines, the focus is understandably on a careful and controlled return.\n\nDespite the caution, the overall mood around Mendy’s recovery is positive, and there is growing optimism that he will soon be back in the squad.\n\nThe current plan is for Mendy to be included in the matchday list for the upcoming trip to Valencia at Mestalla.\n\nHowever, there is no expectation that he will start the match and the idea is to reintroduce him gradually, allowing him to build rhythm and confidence without taking unnecessary risks.\n\nOnce he is fully available, he will have to compete for his place like everyone else in the squad.\n\nFerland Mendy is close to returning. (Photo by Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images)\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding his role is linked to a wider issue at left-back. What once looked like a well-covered position has now become a tactical puzzle.\n\nEven when natural options such as Fran Garcia and Alvaro Carreras have been available, Arbeloa has at times opted to use Eduardo Camavinga in that role.\n\nIn Arbeloa’s system, the full-backs often move into central areas during build-up, effectively acting as auxiliary midfielders.\n\nIn that context, a player like Camavinga fits the profile. His ability on the ball and comfort in central zones make him a natural choice for that hybrid role.\n\nHowever, the selection choices also suggest a deeper issue, which is a possible lack of confidence in the specialist left-backs.\n\nThe repeated preference for a midfielder in that position points to doubts within the coaching staff about the reliability of the natural options.\n\nWith Mendy now approaching full fitness, his return will add another name to the competition, but it remains to be seen whether he will reclaim a regular starting spot or face the same uncertainty as the others.",

Per Romano, Real Madrid did not even make a bid:\n\n🚨🔐 Dayot Upamecano will formally sign soon his new deal at Bayern until June 2030.\n\nExclusive story on new deal accepted, 100% confirmed, Upa’s ready to put pen to paper.\n\nThere will be release clause + many clubs were keen, no bid from Real Madrid\n\nX account @iMiaSanMia summarized Romano’s YouTube video and added more context to Romano’s X post where he stated that only Paris Saint-Germain and an unnamed English club showed “concrete interest” in Upamecano:\n\nTwo clubs showed concrete interest in Dayot Upamecano: PSG and one English club. Real Madrid explored the possibility but there were no concrete proposals. But in the end Upamecano decided to stay at FC Bayern. The release clause included in the new contract will be valid from summer 2027.\n\nThroughout the process, there was a mountain of reporting — some good, some bad. If true, this paints a different picture of what Upamecano was really looking at, which might have been no formal bids and just two clubs outside of Bayern Munich willing to discuss his big contract demands.\n\nHowever, the biggest news from Romano is about the release clause, which he is saying will be active in 2027. Romano did not include the fee attached to it, but previous rumors indicated it would be €60 million to €65 million.\n\nAs a reminder, there has been no official conformation of the release clause or its fee, but Bayern Munich does not typically divulge contractual details.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Shortly after helping the Philadelphia 76ers knock off the Golden State Warriors 113-94 on Tuesday for the team's fifth-straight win, rookie guard VJ Edgecombe sat at his locker smiling. This comes after yet another impressive performance for one of the gam's dynamic young guards.\n\nA night after shooting just 1-for-11 in Monday's win over the Los Angeles Clippers to start the team's 5-game road trip, Edgecombe had 25 points on 11-for-20 shooting against the Warriors. There was nothing coach Steve Kerr and Co. could do against the No. 3 overall pick as he made sure the Sixers were in the best position to win the game.\n\nWith that being said, the fact that Edgecombe was able to shake off such a tough performance in LA was an impressive showing. Yes, the Warriors are a scuffling group a bit, but the rookie continues to make strides.\n\n\"I'm gonna be honest, I just flushed it,\" Edgecombe said. \"Last night, I just missed a bunch of open shots. It happens. It happens to everybody. Not every night you gonna make all the shots. Last night (Monday), I was 1-for-11. I missed 10 shots. I was like, 'You know what? I'm not gonna sit here and soak in it, I'm not gonna mope around.' My teammates have extra faith in me, and they literally told me tonight, 'You're due for a good game.'\"\n\nThe rookie guard is a relentless worker. He has a thirst to be great and it's shown on a nightly basis. The Sixers also have real faith in him that he can get going no matter what is going on. The confidence from his team along with the confidence he already has in himself makes him a tough kid.\n\n\"I trust my work,\" Edgecombe said. \"I know I work hard. It's just confidence. It's all confidence. I got my teammates, especially. Once your teammates are trusting you, man, I feel like we can just go out there and go hoop. I don't even have to worry about anything. I don't have to worry if they care if you miss it, you know what I'm saying? At the end of the day, it's a team game. They know I'm gonna make the right plays. Yeah, they just have a ton of faith in me, and I just go out there and go hoop.\"\n\nEdgecombe and the Sixers will now head back to Los Angeles to face the Lakers on Thursday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers' VJ Edgecombe explains his confidence after win over Warriors",

    "fullText": "There is a common angst among college football fans with the College Football Playoff, the length of the grind and for teams like Notre Dame, they’ve had to adjust much of what they do to get to the end.\n\nLast season, the Irish and Ohio State, and this year with Indiana and Miami, saw their seasons conclude almost two months after the regular season ended. The hope was that the CFP committee would make some adjustments to the schedule, but as we found out on Tuesday, that won’t be the case.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the quarterfinal games for 2026 will be played on Dec. 30th and Jan. 1st, and then just over two weeks later the semifinals will be played. The scheduled is very similar for the 2027 season as well, and it just doesn’t feel like college football.\n\nAs Josh Pate pointed out, Saturday, Nov. 14th is the midpoint of the “season” which is crazy to think about. There is no need for such a large gap, and I personally hate that these games aren’t played on Saturday’s. Sure, contending with the NFL isn’t a great idea, but college football has plenty of history playing on Saturday’s. The long layoffs are unnecessary as well, as players are accustomed to just a week to prepare for the next game.\n\nHopefully some changes will be made going forward, but for at least the next two seasons, the CFP schedule will be long and drawn out.\n\nUpcoming College Football Playoff dates for the quarterfinals and semi-finals the next two years.

    "fullText": "Miguel Freckelton's late header, fired beyond Alex Schwolow to seal a deserved St Mirren victory, merely underlined what had been apparent long before the final whistle.\n\nFrom the opening exchanges Hearts looked off the pace. Even allowing for some admirable, at times heroic, defending after being reduced to ten men, few inside the ground could argue with the outcome of the game.\n\nWhen Derek McInnes sits down to analyse this one there will be no shortage of moments to rewind, slow down and scrutinise. The decisive goal itself was born from a catalogue of errors that will irritate the Hearts manager far more than the final scoreline.\n\nShould the initial cross that led to the corner have been blocked? Did Schwolow really need to push a ball that appeared to be drifting wide behind? Why was a six-foot-plus defender allowed to run unchallenged from the back post to the front and meet the header? And more broadly, where was the composure at the back that ultimately led to Craig Halkett's dismissal?\n\nThese questions - and several others - will be picked over forensically in the coming days. Lessons will need to be learned, and quickly.\n\nBut perspective matters. This was only Hearts' third defeat over 90 minutes all season. Offered that return last summer, anyone connected with the club would have snapped your hand off.\n\nThere is no reason for panic, no need for melodrama. Instead, there is an opportunity because next comes the perfect response game. Hibernian at Tynecastle. Under the floodlights. With scrutiny dialled all the way up and the footballing world watching.\n\nThe question will be asked loudly and repeatedly: do Hearts really have what it takes to go all the way in the Premiership title race?",

    "fullText": "The way of the college football world today breaks down to this: coaches don’t get many opportunities to screw up, and anything short of a national championship is considered a screw up. So, given that current logic, it’s no surprise that the Houston Chronicle recently published a column noting that Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian sits atop a steadily warming hot-ish seat after the Longhorns missed the College Football Playoff last season.\n\nFrom the Chronicle: “Steve Sarkisian is not on any hot seat by a long shot. Not after going 35-8 the past three years (with two of the losses in the College Football Playoff semifinals and three other losses to Georgia and, oh yeah, Florida). He reached the CFP two of the previous three seasons and barely missed this past season. But he’s on the warming seat. And he’s got company. Sarkisian is preparing for his sixth season at Texas after seeing 26 of his players transfer out and 19 transfer in, including the portal’s top-ranked wide receiver, two outstanding running backs and two elite linebackers. The big number of those leaving suggest Texas badly missed its evaluations on more than two dozen players or drastically upgraded all of those positions. Actually, both of those premises could be true. Sarkisian at least grasps the sense of urgency among Longhorn Nation because this isn’t a place where you want to miss the playoff two years in a row. But he’s not alone. I’d say the top five coaches with the most heat on them, in order, are Alabama’s Kalen DeBoer, Oregon’s Dan Lanning, Sarkisian, LSU’s Lane Kiffin and USC’s Lincoln Riley. None of these obviously are in a must-win situation like some others. … Those on the hottest of hot seats are Baylor’s Dave Aranda (three losing seasons in the past four years), Florida State’s Mike Norvell (coming off 2-10 and 5-7 seasons), Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell (16-21 over three years), Maryland’s Mike Locksley (1-8 in Big Ten two straight years) and South Carolina’s Shane “Did you see our first half against the Aggies?” Beamer. … Of the group needing to break through and avoid slipping backward, they just need to win big and dispel the notion that they have hit a wall and have to get past it. DeBoer, it says here, is the best coach in the nation not named Kirby Smart, Curt Cignetti or Ryan Day, yet a large percentage of Crimson Tide fans think his days might be numbered if a third year isn’t more successful after missing the CFP in Year 1 and winning one CFP game over an average Oklahoma team in Year 2. Lanning has been a borderline disaster in the CFP, getting squashed by Ohio State in 2024 and mauled by Indiana in 2025 (after dominating Texas Tech). Kiffin may or may not have a honeymoon in his first season at Baton Rouge, but he’s still not been on the sidelines for a CFP game yet in his career. Riley can sure develop a quarterback or two with Caleb Williams and Jayden Maiava, but when is the breakthrough season coming? Lots of urgency in 2026.“\n\nWHAT THEY’RE SAYING ABOUT THE LONGHORNS\n\nAustin American-Statesman: Golden: Why depth is key for Jim Schlossnagle, 2026 Texas baseball\n\nAustin American-Statesman: Texas Longhorns: 5 stats UT must improve to win championship\n\nAustin American-Statesman: Sean Miller, Longhorns earn average marks with midseason grades\n\nAustin American-Statesman: Why Texas basketball coach Sean Miller has kept the faith in his bench\n\nInside Texas: Texas’ likely preference for outside zone is perfect for Hollywood Smothers and Raleek Brown\n\nInside Texas: Bijan Robinson: Three years into the NFL\n\nTexas holds off South Carolina in 84-75 win\n\nNo 4.

He seems to have great tools but an uncanny ability to stay off of the field (just eight games in a season-plus in the White Sox system). In 2025, he was assigned to Kannapolis but was … wait for it … injured. He lasted just eight games of ACL rehab before hitting the IL-60 again.\n\nAldrin Batista\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 22\n2025 SSS Prospect Vote ranking 6\n2025 high level Winston-Salem (High-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.2 years\nOverall 2025 stats 2-0 ▪️ 7 games (2 starts) ▪️ 14 IP ▪️ 5.79 ERA ▪️ 17 K ▪️ 7 BB ▪️ 1.429 WHIP ▪️-1.2 WAR\n\nBatista was our No. 6-voted player in last year’s poll and top righthander — and then disaster struck, as he started the third Dash game of the season on April 6 and then was out more than four months with a stress fracture in his right (pitching) elbow. His return in late August was iffy, with three poor relief appearances of five. But he ended the season with a scoreless (two-inning) “opener” start, which hopefully reverses the curse for 2026.\n\nRyan Burrowes\nSecond Baseman\nAge 21\n2024 SSS Prospect Vote ranking 23\n2025 SSS Prospect Vote ranking N/R\n2025 high level Winston-Salem (High-A)\nAge relative to high level -2.0 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Low-A/High-A) 111 games ▪️ 6 HR ▪️ 39 RBI ▪️ .255/.342/.355 ▪️ 47-of-53 (88.7%) SB ▪️ 39 BB ▪️ 110 K ▪️ .976 FLD%▪️ 1.1 WAR\n\nIt feels like Burrowes has been around forever, and he’s still only 21 years old (and playing at a level significantly younger than his age). His first taste of High-A ball went pretty well, as his baserunning seems to have no trouble translating at any level. The hit tool is solid, although he continues to struggle with contact — a no-no for a speed-over-power guy.\n\nCaden Connor\nLeft Fielder\nAge 25\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -2.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA/AAA) 126 games ▪️ 7 HR ▪️ 64 RBI ▪️ .272/.358/.366 ▪️ 13-of-16 (81.3%) SB ▪️ 60 BB ▪️ 81 K ▪️ .982 FLD%▪️ 1.9 WAR\n\nLike Ryan Galanie, it’s hard to know what to make of Connor. The end of the 2025 season, at Charlotte, marked the first time in his pro career that he’s not played old for his level. But aside from a dip in July, Connor hit well all season and didn’t get dunked underwater at Charlotte. Theoretically with a weak White Sox outfield, the sky’s the limit for him in 2026.\n\nReudis Diaz\nRight-handed relief pitcher\nAge 20\n2025 high level ACL (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -2.1 years\nOverall 2025 stats 1-1 ▪️ 1 SV▪️ 21 games (4 finishes) ▪️ 27 2/3 IP ▪️ 2.28.ERA ▪️ 18 K ▪️ 8 BB ▪️ 1.084 WHIP ▪️1.2 WAR\n\nWho? You’re forgiven for being unfamiliar with an extremely young arm who hasn’t yet gotten out of rookie ball, but our No. 77 prospect a year ago (then a starter, repeating the DSL and killing it) made a successful adjustment Stateside. He’ll return to starting in 2026, likely getting his feet wet in Arizona and getting a promotion to Low-A in the second half of the season.\n\nRyan Galanie\nFirst Baseman\nAge 25\n2025 high level Birmingham (AA)\nAge relative to high level +1.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (High-A/AA) 119 games ▪️ 11 HR ▪️ 94 RBI ▪️ .276/.327/.422 ▪️ 14-of-17 (82.4%) SB ▪️ 35 BB ▪️ 79 K ▪️ .995 FLD%▪️ 1.1 WAR\n\nIt’s been a slow but steady climb for this 13th-rounder in 2023. The good news here is, with the caveat that Galanie has always competed older than his level, Galanie has found some footing. While his power/slugging numbers are merely OK, he drove in 94 runs in 2025. He disappeared a bit in the playoffs for Birmingham (just four hits in six games, with five walks as well) but started every game in the march to a second consecutive Southern League title for the Barons.\n\nJairo Iriarte\nRight-Handed Relief Pitcher\nAge 24\n2025 SSS Top Prospect Vote Ranking 19\n2025 high level Charlotte (AAA)\nAge relative to high level -4.3 years\nOverall 2025 stats (Rookie/AAA) 3-3▪️ 1 SV ▪️ 37 games (5 starts, 9 finishes) ▪️ 48 IP ▪️ 7.13 ERA ▪️ 50 K ▪️ 37 BB ▪️ 1.917 WHIP ▪️ -0.8 WAR\n\nThe 2025 season was an utter disaster for Iriarte, who went from prospective South Side rotation member to lost in space. The righty, who made his brief debut in the majors in 2024, both lost the plate and misplaced his strikeout power. The Brian Bannister Pitching Lab has its work cut out here, for sure.\n\nJavier Mogollón\nShortstop\nAge 20\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level -1.4 years\nOverall 2025 stats 51 games ▪️ 5 HR ▪️ 19 RBI ▪️ .220/.347/.387 ▪️ 15-of-21 (71.4%) SB ▪️ 30 BB ▪️ 56 K ▪️ .971 FLD%▪️ 1.0 WAR\n\nAn ascending star just one year ago, we have to tap the breaks a bit on Mogollón after a lackluster first full season of minors ball. While still young for his level and managing to keep his head above water in a new league every season of his career, Mogollón’s undeniable hitting in Rookie ball fell off significantly with the Cannon Ballers. However, how much of that was due to battling injury is undetermined, as Mogollón was shelved for what turned out to be the season on July 2.\n\nYobal Rodriguez\nRight-Handed Starting Pitcher\nAge 18\n2025 high level DSL White Sox (Rookie)\nAge relative to high level -1.5 years\nOverall 2025 stats 0-3 ▪️ 13 games (10 starts) ▪️ 30 1/3 IP ▪️2.97 ERA ▪️ 33 K ▪️ 13 BB ▪️ 1.022 WHIP ▪️ 1.2 WAR\n\nRodriguez is a rare DSL pitcher, not for his relatively light innings load, but as a primary starter — and at just 17 years old (Yobal turns 18 on February 9). Inasmuch as it’s tough to project anyone out of the DSL, especially pitchers, you could hardly have hoped for more from him in his pro debut.\n\nColby Shelton\nShortstop\nAge 23\n2025 high level Kannapolis (Low-A)\nAge relative to high level +1.6 years\nOverall 2025 NCAA stats 45 games ▪️ 7 HR ▪️ 35 RBI ▪️ .377/.458/.606 ▪️ 6-of-9 (66.7%) SB ▪️ 21 BB ▪️ 24 K ▪️ 2.7 WAR\n\nShelton is more of a slugger than a speedster, with the usual caveats about whether he will stick at shortstop. His credentials are impressive, playing full-time in the SEC in all three of his college years (one at Alabama, two with Georgia). Given the crowded field for the White Sox at shortstop, Shelton’s defensive ability will mean very little provided he can keep clubbing.\n\nPast South Side Sox Prospect votes\n\nHere is how 2018 wrangled out — all 42 picks.

The Crimson Tide fell to No. 23 in the coaches poll.\n\nThis week, LSU has another chance to climb the rankings and boost its chances at getting a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament bracketology.

    "fullText": "The 2025–26 NBA season delivered a fresh wave of breakout stars, with six players earning their first All-Star selections through sustained growth and undeniable impact. Each of these players took a meaningful leap, either by expanding their offensive responsibilities, anchoring a defense, or becoming indispensable to their team’s identity. Together, they represent the league’s constant evolution and the reward that comes from opportunity meeting preparation.\n\nDeni Avdija breaks new ground as one of the league’s most complete two-way forwards this season. His All-Star nod reflects a career-high scoring uptick and unprecedented playmaking for a Trail Blazers forward, putting him among the rare players averaging 25+ points, 7+ rebounds, and 6+ assists. Beyond the counting stats, Avdija’s selection is historic: he’s the first NBA All-Star from Israel, showcasing his rapid ascent and growing global impact. His versatile game has been a key factor for Portland’s competitiveness this season.\n\nJalen Duren has emerged as a true interior force for the Detroit Pistons, anchoring both ends of the court with energy and efficiency. This first All-Star selection comes as a result of his elite rebounding and inside scoring, where he ranks among the league’s best in key paint-dominant metrics. Duren’s physicality sets the tone for Detroit defensively, and his offensive improvements have made him a reliable secondary scoring option. His trajectory suggests he could become one of the NBA’s premier big men for years to come.\n\nChet Holmgren’s All-Star breakthrough signifies the Thunder’s rise defensively and his unique impact on both ends of the floor. In just his third NBA season, he’s developed into a disruptive rim protector while continuing to expand his scoring and rebounding prowess. Holmgren’s combination of size, agility, and shooting range makes him a matchup problem and a centerpiece of OKC’s identity. His inclusion among the league’s elite this year highlights how integral he’s become to his team’s success\n\nBack at full health after a season cut short by injury, Jalen Johnson has taken a massive leap to become one of the Hawks’ central playmakers. His All-Star selection reflects career-high production across scoring, rebounding, and facilitating, with a rare all-around stat line that puts him in elite company. Johnson’s athleticism and versatility have given Atlanta a multi-dimensional threat on offense and a disruptive presence on defense. This first All-Star appearance underscores his growth into a franchise cornerstone.\n\nJamal Murray’s first All-Star nod comes after years of high-impact performances that previously went unrecognized in the midseason showcase. This season represents a personal best on both ends of the court, where he’s set new marks in scoring, assists, and shooting efficiency. Murray’s knack for clutch play and generating offense has been vital for the Nuggets, especially during stretches without Nikola Jokić. His breakthrough honors reflect the high-level consistency he’s brought to Denver’s lineup.\n\nAt 32 years old, Norman Powell’s first All-Star selection is a testament to perseverance and gradual refinement of his game. In Miami, Powell has become a primary scoring threat, putting up career-best numbers while leading one of the highest-scoring offenses in the league. His sharpshooting and ability to take over games in isolation have made him an X-factor for the Heat. This long-awaited recognition rewards years of hard-earned development and situational excellence.\n\nThese first-time All-Stars didn’t arrive by accident; their selections reflect seasons defined by consistency, resilience, and expanded roles. From young cornerstones announcing their arrival to veterans finally receiving overdue recognition, this group captures multiple paths to All-Star status. As the league continues to shift, the 2025–26 class stands as a snapshot of the NBA’s next phase and the players shaping it.\n\nThe post NBA: First-time All-Stars for 2025-2026 season appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Though the Ducks were down their two leading scorers, the Hawks played a solid game wire-to-wire, trailing just 1:39.\n\nBen McCollum has done something through 3 games out west, where we have seen other Hawkeye outfits struggle.

Fran McCaffery lost two games in blowouts amidst the Palisades fire last year.\n\nYet Ben McCollum has them 3-0 with a solid chance at 4-0 tonight against the Washington Huskies (12-10, 4-7). Their record belies their advanced stats as both KenPom & Bart Torvik rate them in the 40s. Iowa is rated 19th by KenPom & 20th by Bart Torvik, which puts their chances tonight at ~57%.\n\nThat segues nicely into a deeper look into Iowa’s stats and how they stack up halfway through the Big Ten season. Let’s start with the most shocking stat: at 63.0 points allowed per game, Iowa ranks 4th in the NATION & tops in the conference. A big reason for that is pace – both advanced analytic sites rank them in the bottom 20 in that respect.\n\nBut it goes further than that, as Iowa has been excellent in two areas: three-point defense & turnover %. They’re allowing opponents to make just 30% of threes on the season (28.9% in conference play). They rank 29th in the nation in that respect, and tops in the conference. Additionally, opponents are taking 37.7% of their shots from deep, which ranks in the top 3rd nationally. In conference play, their rank is 2nd at 37.3%.\n\nIowa’s turning teams over 22.1% of the time – 7th in the country. Their in-conference rate is 19.9%, and tops here. Iowa’s forcing live ball turnovers 11.3% of the time in Big Ten games (once again tops in the league) and 12.1% overall.\n\nWhat this combination of stats supplement when watching the games is that the Hawks simply guard harder than they have in nearly two decades. Everyone is fighting, they’re handing off screens well, they’re jumping passing lanes. Each of Bennett Stirtz, Tavion Banks, and Isaia Howard rank nationally in steal percentage, paced by Howard’s 4.3% which is 34th in the country.\n\nA portion of this is because they have to: Iowa lacks a true rim protector right now and it shows. Teams are shooting 55.5% from 2 in conference play, ranking 16th. The activity on the perimeter is also opening Iowa up to opposing guards attacking driving lanes with aplomb. The overall mindset is all resulting in a ton of fouls – opponent free throw rates in conference is 40.7% FTA:FGA, bottom in the league. Yuck.\n\nDespite all that, Iowa’s defense is a top 20 outfit – at 97.3 per KenPom & 96.7 at Bart Torvik. Only twice did Iowa’s defense under Fran McCaffery finish in the top 30 and this group would be the best according to KenPom since they finished first in the nation in 2006.\n\nOffensively, there is little drop-off from recent Fran-led teams, with Iowa sitting at 27th in adjusted efficiency according to KenPom. Recent Fran units finished 16th and 18th after a run of top 10 units from 2019-2023.\n\nOf course, the tip of the spear is Bennett Stirtz. He’s the type of guard Iowa has not had in a good long time. Maybe I squint and see Adam Haluska? Andre Woolridge, maybe? He’s 6th in conference both in scoring at 19.0 points/game and assists at 5.0. He’s the only guy in the top six of both category and has been an Iron Man despite fighting through some illness as the conference season ramped. His 90.1% of minutes played ranks 15th. He’s coming off his best game and if he continues playing like this…I like Iowa’s chances against damn near anybody.\n\nBut it’s more than him – early in the season Ben McCollum referenced the importance of paint touches and I kind of can’t stop myself from getting excited any time someone gets in the lane. It’s almost like the equivalent of a 4-5 yard carry every run play where the offense is piling up the body blows. It’s resulted in an effective field goal percentage of 58.5% and 60.2% from 2 (9th in the country). Stirtz & Banks – Iowa’s highest volume shooters from 2 – are at 58.6% and 54.2%. Only Kael Combs, at 55.4% joins them under 60%. Everyone else in the rotation is above 60%.\n\nThe other value of paint touches is that it leads to kickouts on open 3s. Iowa is hitting 37.4% from deep, 29th in the nation. Howard is the lagger there, at 27.5%, but everyone else is above 37%.\n\nOverall, it’s led to a very consistent team game-to-game. I’ve kind of marveled at Iowa’s “Game Score” graph at Bart Torvik.\n\nThey’ve got just one game below 50 – an early season win over Western Illinois – and a second right at 50 when they went on the road to Michigan State. Only three other games below 80, losses to Minnesota and Illinois and then the win versus Rutgers. Just a team who is very comfortable doing what they do agains almost anybody.\n\nThis was just not a level of consistency we had seen from Iowa under late stage Fran. They were far too reliant on the natural variation of basketball – makes and misses – and did not have the rallying cry this group does of “Impose Your Will.”\n\nOf course, there are still 10 conference games left – McCollum, the maniac referred to the games after USC as an 11-game conference tournament – and things could fall apart. But Iowa is performing about as well as could be expected as they’re sitting in the top half of the conference at 6-4. A win tonight would put them in a tie for 7th with UCLA and a game behind Purdue and Wisconsin.\n\nIt’s a tall, and late, task but if there’s a group who will come out and play as expected – it’s this one.",

    "fullText": "Roma, AC Milan and Napoli were chief among them but owing to a combination of factors no deal could be done. Chiesa’s wage - estimated at £140k per week - is too rich for most Italian clubs.\n\nAnd Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes was never going to give him away for free either. It meant Serie A sides were limited to offering only a loan deal for Chiesa - which was not appealing to Liverpool.\n\nChiesa stuck at it, making himself an option for Slot during the 2025/26 season.\n\nHe has provided two top-flight goals and has been a bigger presence in and around the squad. For that he deserves credit but it always looked likely that the club would entertain a January deal if the right offer was made.\n\nJuventus came forward - with head coach Luciano Spalletti keen to work with Chiesa again following their time together in the Italian national team.\n\nThe Old Lady could offer a loan fee plus an option to buy - but even this structure wasn’t appealing enough for Liverpool to do business.\n\nWe are led to believe that Chiesa would have been open to a deal because he is seeking to reestablish himself in the Italy squad ahead of the FIFA World Cup playoffs in March.\n\nGaining first-team football would have no doubt aided though efforts but right now he is stuck on one start for Liverpool in the league and not reckoned to be in contention for many more.\n\nJuve however walked away and concluded a loan deal for Nice winger Jeremie Boga instead. The finances work much better for the Turin giants - who would have been paying up to £13m in a loan fee plus a permanent obligation plus wages for Chiesa.\n\nThe Euro 2020 winger has in effect been priced out of a deal and unless he can make another breakthrough under Slot he is set for a very frustrating spell on the sidelines for the second half of the campaign.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have signed goalkeeper Honor Solomon from Blackburn Rovers, it has been confirmed by the player’s agency.\n\nSolomon joined Blackburn Rovers in 2021, having spent eight years with United’s cross-town rivals, Manchester City.\n\nA modern-style goalkeeper who is comfortable with the ball at his feet, Solomon also boasts sharp reflexes and confident shot-stopping.\n\nHe primarily played for Blackburn Rovers’ Under-18 and Under-21 teams. This term, he has racked up six appearances across Premier League 2, the Premier League Cup and the National League Cup.\n\nSolomon has conceded 11 goals in that period.\n\nThe 19-year-old was on the bench when Blackburn stunned United with a shocking 4-0 away win in October last year.\n\nSolomon has gained valuable senior experience through loan moves, having spent time with Clitheroe and Atherton Collieries.\n\nNow, it has emerged that Solomon has sealed a move to United.\n\nThe transfer has been confirmed by Solomon’s agency, Harwick Sports, on social media.\n\nThe sports agency uploaded a graphic to their Instagram page announcing that the goalkeeper is now part of United’s ranks.\n\nThey captioned the image with the message, “Congrats to @solhonor1 on his move to Manchester United. Big opportunity — all the best with the next step Sol.”\n\nAccording to Rich Fay of the Manchester World, Solomon is poised to provide competition at Under-21 level.\n\nHis challenge for regular minutes will see him contend with Elyh Harrison, William Murdock, and Dermot Mee. Harrison recently returned to United after being recalled from his loan spell at League Two club Shrewsbury Town.\n\nIf he excels, Solomon could well find himself competing with Senne Lammens at the first-team level.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Carrick and his players return to action on Saturday when they host Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford in the early kick-off.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "NBC analyst Devin McCourty compares the Lions’ 2025 struggles to Patriots teams that dealt with coordinator turnover and explains why Detroit must adjust fast.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions didn’t suddenly forget how to play football in 2025, but according to NBC analyst and former Patriots captain Devin McCourty, they ran straight into one of the hardest realities in the NFL: coordinator turnover.\n\nSpeaking recently about Detroit’s season, McCourty said the Lions’ drop-off wasn’t surprising at all. In fact, it looked painfully familiar to what he lived through during his 13-year run with the New England Patriots.\n\nAnd if Lions fans are looking for a silver lining, McCourty’s message was pretty clear: this is fixable, but it’s real.\n\nMcCourty pointed to multiple moments in Patriots history when New England took a step back after losing key coordinators. Even with Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and elite talent still in place, things didn’t always click immediately once new voices took over.\n\n“One thing I’ve learned,” McCourty explained, “is when you lose coordinators, that creates so much unknown.”\n\nHe lived it firsthand. After New England won the Super Bowl in 2007, Brady’s knee injury in 2008 and the challenge of replacing offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and defensive coordinator Dean Pees stalled the Patriots for several seasons. The roster was strong, but the rhythm wasn’t the same.\n\nMcCourty says that’s not a coincidence — and it’s exactly what Detroit just experienced.\n\nDetroit entered the 2025 season with new coordinators on both sides of the ball, then changed offensive play-callers midseason. Now, the Lions are preparing for yet another offensive shift in 2026 with Drew Petzing taking over play-calling duties.\n\nFrom McCourty’s perspective, that kind of churn matters — even when the scheme looks similar on paper.\n\n“Brian Flores didn’t call the defense the same way Matt Patricia did,” McCourty said while reflecting on New England’s own transitions. “Yes, it was a lot of the same stuff, but it was different.”\n\nThose subtle differences, he explained, can impact timing, confidence, communication, and ultimately results.\n\nOne key distinction McCourty made clear: the Lions’ roster is not broken.\n\nThe core of Detroit’s team remains largely intact from the group that won 15 games in 2024. That matters. A lot.\n\nIn McCourty’s eyes, this wasn’t a collapse — it was a recalibration year while players and coaches tried to adjust to new systems, new voices, and new expectations.\n\nStill, he warned that the Lions can’t just assume things will magically snap back into place.\n\nMcCourty didn’t sugarcoat it. If the Lions want to contend for the Super Bowl in 2026, there’s work to do — especially in establishing clarity and continuity.\n\nNew coordinators don’t just need time to install schemes. Players need to trust them. Coaches need to align. And the entire organization has to move in the same direction again.\n\nThat’s the part, McCourty says, fans often underestimate.\n\nThe good news? Detroit has the foundation. The bad news? The margin for error is smaller when expectations are sky-high.\n\nThe post Detroit Lions’ 2025 Regression Didn’t Surprise Super Bowl Champ Devin McCourty appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "We asked for your thoughts on Aberdeen's business in the January transfer window.\n\nGary: It's very difficult to be optimistic as a Dons fan, really hard watching Falkirk, Hearts and Hibs who are miles ahead of us. Too many continued loan signings that don't give the squad stability moving forward. Loan signings don't really care about the club as they know in five months time they are potentially heading back to their own club. Time for change at the top.\n\nFred: I cannot see the window activity making us a stronger team in the short term. We have lost two creative players and signed players who have struggled for game time in their previous teams. For me the only real positive is the new goalkeeper. I hope the new and old players can quickly gel into a team.\n\nSteve: Absolutely devastated that Leighton Clarkson has gone. What a talent, wasted this season through lack of game time. Why not put him out on loan? But to see loan players who were brought in, and let's face it, they're only here to get game time, start before you, must be demoralising despite putting the effort in on the training pitch. It will be interesting keeping tabs on him at Blackpool now. Thank you Leighton, for everything you gave to the Dons, and hopefully you'll agree, \"once a Don, always a Don.\"\n\nMark: A first window for the new sporting director gets some pass marks for addressing some squad gaps and shifting some of the dead wood and expensive low impact players. This is clearly a stop gap until the summer when the real work will begin. Aberdeen remain a paper tiger.\n\nIan: They have left themselves a lot to do but the players need to step up now. They have let the club down badly, hopefully the new players will have a bit more fight about them.\n\nStuart: Disappointed the club has not signed a player that would have got the fans jumping in their seats. Too many unknowns coming in and can I just say all the best to Clarkson at Blackpool, a hugely talented player who graced Pittodrie.",

    "fullText": "It’s pretty safe the say that the general sentiment around college football is that Notre Dame will make its return to the College Football Playoff in 2026.\n\nThe Irish were left out of this year’s 12-team event, as many believed that they deserved to be in. After what we saw unfold, it was pretty safe to say that Notre Dame should have been in, as it very well could have won it all.\n\nAs for this coming season, CBS Sports Brad Crawford released his way-too-early CFP bracket projection, and he’s got the Irish as the No. 2 seed. Miami, one of Notre Dame’s opponents, takes the to spot, so it seems like whoever loses that game finds their footing once again. Texas and Indiana round out his top-4.\n\nIn this scenario, the Irish would take on the winner of the 7 vs. 10 matchup as Crawford has Texas A&M and Oregon battling it out in the first round. Overall, it’s an interesting take, with four Big Ten and SEC teams, Texas Tech making it again and Memphis as the Group of 5 team.\n\nIt will be interesting to come back to this when the regular season is over, but it doesn’t seem like the worst field considering which teams are participating.\n\nWay-Too-Early College Football Playoff projection for the 2026 season, via @BCrawford247 👀\n\nWhat would you change?\n\n🔗 https://t.co/QnshRG871e pic.twitter.com/Dlc3J28sIW\n\n— CBS Sports College Football 🏈 (@CBSSportsCFB) February 3, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: What seed is Notre Dame in CBS Sports early 2026 CFP projection?",

    "fullText": "Merino is facing a prolonged spell on the sidelines after suffering a foot injury that requires surgery, with the length of his expected absence still unclear.\n\nSpeaking after Arsenal’s Carabao Cup semi final win over Chelsea on Tuesday night, Mikel Arteta confirmed the seriousness of the issue, telling beIN SPORTS, “With Merino, yeah, he’s going to be out for months unfortunately, with a foot injury.”\n\nWhile Arsenal have indicated they remain hopeful Merino could return before the end of the season, Zubimendi’s remarks following the same match suggested the situation may be more uncertain.\n\nSpeaking about his international team mate, he said, “Well, he’s in pain. He’s a very professional person, who takes care of himself and always thinks about what’s best for the club. I know he’s the one who’s most hurt, but the damage his injury has done to the club is significant.”\n\nZubimendi went on to acknowledge the challenge Merino faces in trying to recover in time for international duty. He said, “Well, he seems fine, but everyone’s different when they get home. I understand it’s harder than it looks. I know he’ll do everything he can to make it [to the national team], and if he doesn’t, it’ll be a real shame. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nWith the World Cup due to begin on 11 June, just over two weeks after the Premier League season ends on 24 May and six days after the Champions League final, the margin for recovery is tight.\n\nZubimendi’s comments underline concerns that Merino’s campaign may already be over, despite Arsenal’s hope that he could yet return before the season concludes.",

    "fullText": "15 years ago, this day would have been massive. But now with the early NSD period in December, the first Wednesday in February is just a footnote in the recruiting calendar. Penn State’s class is basically, with four-star WR Samson Gash expected to stick with his commitment to Michigan State despite a late push from the new Penn State staff. Here’s who the Nittany Lions will bring in in a pieced-together 2026 class:\n\nDE Elijah Reeder (91.53 Rivals Industry Rating)\nDE Jackson Ford (90.67)\nQB/ATH Peyton Falzone (89.33)\nCB Josiah Zayas (89.21)\nDB Tyrell Chatman (88.10)\nOT Mason Bandhauer (97.43)\nS Bryson Williams (87.43)\nS Amarion Jackson (86.80)\nWR Ben Whitver (86.80)\nRB D’Ante Sheffey (86.43)\nQB Kase Evans (86.13)\nLB Keian Kaiser (85.83)\nOT Pete Eglitis (85.17)\nS Christian Askew (83.53)\nP Lucas Tenbrock (81.57)\n\nIn recent weeks, it appeared that Penn State was surging for five-star PA running back Kemon Spell. The one-time Penn State commit had Rivals recruitnik Steve Wiltfong even put in a prediction for the Nittany Lions.\n\nSpell was set to visit Happy Valley on January 24th, but the visit never materialized. He then went to Georgia this past weekend, and made the call for the Bulldogs.\n\n🚨BREAKING🚨 5-star RB Kemon Spell has committed to Georgia, @Hayesfawcett3 reports🐶\n\nSpell is the No. 1 RB in the 2027 class. \n\nRead: https://t.co/z43NKiTfeU pic.twitter.com/n6XyvukNvd\n\n— Rivals (@Rivals) February 2, 2026\n\nWhile I get the sense that Spell’s recruitment isn’t over — I personally would be surprised if he doesn’t take official visits over the summer — this is certainly a kick to the nads for Penn State. Landing Spell as commitment No. 1 in the 2027 class would have been a huge statement for Matt Campbell & Co., but we’ll see how they pivot from here.\n\nFive-Star OL Maxwell Hiller (Coatesville, PA)\n\nBig time prospect from Just-Outside-Philly that will be a major priority for the new staff. Also, his brother is a five-star basketball prospect in the 2028 class. Not that Penn State will be involved in that, but what kind of freaky genetics do their parents have that they have a son who is a five-star offensive lineman in football and another son who is a five-star wing in basketball?\n\nFour-Star OL Will Slagle (Grinnell, IA)\n\nSlagle is a former Iowa State commit, which obviously means good things for Penn State’s chances.\n\nDL Cahron Wheeler (Baltimore, MD)\n\nNo ranking for Wheeler just yet, but Georgia and Ohio State offers highlight the type of prospect he’ll be.\n\nThree-Star DT Stanley Montgomery (Philadelphia, PA)\n\nWas a former Syracuse commit who backed off his ‘Cuse pledge last night. Very good high school wrestler as well.\n\nThree-Star LB Blake Betton (Shakopee, MN)\n\nMore Midwest vibes given the staff’s connections out there. Intriguing kid at 6-foot-3, 205 pounds as he grows into his body and moves from safety prospect to full-time linebacker.\n\nThree-Star CB Ka’ron Ceaser (Penns Grove, NJ)\n\nPlays at Winslows Township where Bill Belton is the head man and is quietly building a really good high school program.\n\nOn top of Junior Day visits, the staff has already begun locking in official visits for the summer. I’ll put together a full list in due time, but some notable names that announced their Penn State OV this week:\n\nFour-Star DB Malakai Taufoou (San Mateo, CA)\n\nThree-Star CB Zach Gleason Jr. (Pittsburgh, PA)\n\nCB Rico Jackson (Upper Marlboro, MD)",

    "fullText": "It’s been close to a month since Ruben Amorim was dismissed by Manchester United, and the former head coach still hasn’t spoken publicly about his exit.\n\nAmorim’s downfall came quickly. The Portuguese manager lashed out at the club’s hierarchy over a single weekend, leading to his dismissal.\n\nHis final game in charge was a 1-1 draw with Leeds United. The following morning, Ineos made the decision to sack him, ending his tenure after 14 months.\n\nDespite poor results, fans had shown real support for Amorim, who suffered through a dreadful Premier League campaign and the club’s lowest-ever finish in 2024/25. Still, it’s been surprising how little has come from him since leaving Old Trafford.\n\nAmorim’s relationship with the club broke down quickly, and he left with no intention of repairing any ties. But fans never lost faith in him, and his connection with the supporters remained strong throughout.\n\nThe Daily Mail now reports that Amorim has decided to hold off on speaking about his departure from United until after the season has finished.\n\nHe apparently wants to avoid distracting new manager Michael Carrick, who is still settling into the role.\n\nCarrick has started well, matching Amorim’s longest winning run of three games early in his tenure.\n\nAmorim left United frustrated, taking aim at sporting director Jason Wilcox on his way out.\n\nWilcox is said to have been involved in tactical decisions during Amorim’s tenure, which the Portuguese manager reportedly felt overstepped boundaries.\n\nWhile Amorim is holding off on his farewell until season’s end, he might use that moment to shed light on the events leading up to his dismissal.\n\nThere were reports of a heated exchange between Amorim and Wilcox just before the Leeds game, and fans may soon get more clarity on what happened behind closed doors.\n\nThroughout his time as head coach, Amorim was known for his honesty, and there’s no reason to expect that will change now that he’s gone.\n\nBryan Mbeumo names Man Utd player more competitive than Bruno Fernandes in training\n\nDiogo Dalot hits season highs and exposes Ruben Amorim’s system\n\nRio Ferdinand shares what he’s hearing about Benjamin Sesko inside Man Utd training ground",

    "description": "Texas A&M, outside of forward Mackenzie Mgbako, is entirely healthy before facing Alabama, while the Crimson Tide are also in good shape.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) still sits atop the SEC standings after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77, and with seven wins in conference play, the Aggies likely need at least three more victories to solidify their NCAA Tournament chances as an at-large bid. Set to face Alabama on the road, the Crimson Tide is desperate to protect home court after falling to Florida on the road 100-77.\n\nEntering Wednesday's road test, first-year head coach Bucky McMillan spent Monday praising his team rather than spending both the pregame press conference and Aggie basketball hour discussing Alabama's roster, especially center Charles Bediako, who will be available on Wednesday amid his ongoing eligibility battle. After shooting 45% from the field and 38% from beyond the arc, the Aggies will need to continue outshooting opponents to keep the win streak alive.\n\nHowever, Alabama has nearly matched Texas A&M from three-point range over the past two games, making an average of 14 threes per game compared to the Aggies' 15.\n\nHealth-wise, outside of Indiana transfer forward Mackenzie Mgbako, McMillan's roster is entirely healthy heading into Wednesday night, and according to the initial injury report, Alabama will be without three players, while forward Taylor Bol Bowen (7.7 PPG, 5.4 RPG), who was injured against Florida, is listed as \"questionable\" with a 50% chance to play.\n\nEven if Bol Bowen doesn't play, Texas A&M will face a healthy Alabama squad led by star guard Labaron Philon Jr., who is averaging 21.6 points per game, shooting 51% from the field, and 38% from beyond the arc.\n\nThe SEC Student-Athlete Availability Report ahead of Texas A&M at Alabama tomorrow night: pic.twitter.com/M8t9COrbYQ\n\n— TexAgs (@TexAgs) February 4, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M is 100% healthy before facing Alabama on Wednesday",

    "title": "Claude Is a Space to Think",
    "description": "Anthropic explains why Claude will remain ad-free—how advertising incentives conflict with building a genuinely helpful AI assistant users can trust.",
    "fullText": "There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.\n\nAdvertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. We’ve run our own ad campaigns, and our AI models have, in turn, helped many of our customers in the advertising industry.\n\nBut including ads in conversations with Claude would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.\n\nWe want Claude to act unambiguously in our users’ interests. So we’ve made a choice: Claude will remain ad-free. Our users won’t see “sponsored” links adjacent to their conversations with Claude; nor will Claude’s responses be influenced by advertisers or include third-party product placements our users did not ask for.\n\nWhen people use search engines or social media, they’ve come to expect a mixture of organic and sponsored content. Filtering signal from noise is part of the interaction.\n\nConversations with AI assistants are meaningfully different. The format is open-ended; users often share context and reveal more than they would in a search query. This openness is part of what makes conversations with AI valuable, but it’s also what makes them susceptible to influence in ways that other digital products are not.\n\nOur analysis of conversations with Claude (conducted in a way that keeps all data private and anonymous) shows that an appreciable portion involve topics that are sensitive or deeply personal—the kinds of conversations you might have with a trusted advisor. Many other uses involve complex software engineering tasks, deep work, or thinking through difficult problems. The appearance of ads in these contexts would feel incongruous—and, in many cases, inappropriate.\n\nWe still have much to learn about the impact of AI models on the people who use them. Early research suggests both benefits—like people finding support they couldn’t access elsewhere—and risks, including the potential for models to reinforce harmful beliefs in vulnerable users. Introducing advertising incentives at this stage would add another level of complexity. Our understanding of how models translate the goals we set them into specific behaviors is still developing; an ad-based system could therefore have unpredictable results.\n\nBeing genuinely helpful is one of the core principles of Claude’s Constitution, the document that describes our vision for Claude’s character and guides how we train the model. An advertising-based business model would introduce incentives that could work against this principle.\n\nConsider a concrete example. A user mentions they’re having trouble sleeping. An assistant without advertising incentives would explore the various potential causes—stress, environment, habits, and so on—based on what might be most insightful to the user. An ad-supported assistant has an additional consideration: whether the conversation presents an opportunity to make a transaction. These objectives may often align—but not always. And, unlike a list of search results, ads that influence a model’s responses may make it difficult to tell whether a given recommendation comes with a commercial motive or not. Users shouldn’t have to second-guess whether an AI is genuinely helping them or subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable.\n\nEven ads that don’t directly influence an AI model’s responses and instead appear separately within the chat window would compromise what we want Claude to be: a clear space to think and work. Such ads would also introduce an incentive to optimize for engagement—for the amount of time people spend using Claude and how often they return. These metrics aren’t necessarily aligned with being genuinely helpful. The most useful AI interaction might be a short one, or one that resolves the user’s request without prompting further conversation.\n\nWe recognize that not all advertising implementations are equivalent. More transparent or opt-in approaches—where users explicitly choose to see sponsored content—might avoid some of the concerns outlined above. But the history of ad-supported products suggests that advertising incentives, once introduced, tend to expand over time as they become integrated into revenue targets and product development, blurring boundaries that were once more clear-cut. We’ve chosen not to introduce these dynamics into Claude.\n\nAnthropic is focused on businesses, developers, and helping our users flourish. Our business model is straightforward: we generate revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, and we reinvest that revenue into improving Claude for our users. This is a choice with tradeoffs, and we respect that other AI companies might reasonably reach different conclusions.\n\nExpanding access to Claude is central to our public benefit mission, and we want to do it without selling our users’ attention or data to advertisers. To that end, we’ve brought AI tools and training to educators in over 60 countries, begun national AI education pilots with multiple governments, and made Claude available to nonprofits at a significant discount. We continue to invest in our smaller models so that our free offering remains at the frontier of intelligence, and we may consider lower-cost subscription tiers and regional pricing where there is clear demand for it. Should we need to revisit this approach, we’ll be transparent about our reasons for doing so.\n\nAI will increasingly interact with commerce, and we look forward to supporting this in ways that help our users. We’re particularly interested in the potential of agentic commerce, where Claude acts on a user’s behalf to handle a purchase or booking end to end. And we’ll continue to build features that enable our users to find, compare, or buy products, connect with businesses, and more—when they choose to do so.\n\nWe’re also exploring more ways to make Claude a focused space to be at your most productive. Users can already connect third-party tools they use for work—like Figma, Asana, and Canva—and interact with them directly within Claude. We expect to introduce many more useful integrations and expand this toolkit over time.\n\nAll third-party interactions will be grounded in the same overarching design principle: they should be initiated by the user (where the AI is working for them) rather than an advertiser (where the AI is working, at least in part, for someone else). Today, whether someone asks Claude to research running shoes, compare mortgage rates, or recommend a restaurant for a special occasion, Claude’s only incentive is to give a helpful answer. We’d like to preserve that.\n\nWe want our users to trust Claude to help them keep thinking—about their work, their challenges, and their ideas.\n\nOur experience of using the internet has made it easy to assume that advertising on the products we use is inevitable. But open a notebook, pick up a well-crafted tool, or stand in front of a clean chalkboard, and there are no ads in sight.\n\nWe think Claude should work the same way.",

    "description": "OpenClaw is taking over the world — yet its security posture is mostly unknown. Follow along as we secure OpenClaw using a battle-tested method with HAProxy.",
    "fullText": "OpenClaw (née MoltBot, née ClawdBot) is taking over the world. Everyone is spinning their own, either on a VPS, or their own Mac mini.\n\nBut here's the problem: OpenClaw is brand new, and its security posture is mostly unknown. Security researchers have already found thousands of publicly available instances exposing everything from credentials to private messages.\n\nWhile OpenClaw has a Gateway component — the UI and WebSocket that controls access — there are serious issues with its password/token-based authentication:\n\nUntil recently, you could skip authentication entirely on localhost.\n\nThe GET URL token authentication mechanism is questionable for such young code.\n\nTrust needs to be earned, not assumed.\n\nIn this post, we'll secure OpenClaw using a battle-tested method with HAProxy.\n\nHAProxy’s HTTP Basic Authentication is a robust method for securing access to production systems with a username/password combination. In this guide, we’ll do the following:\n\nConfigure HAProxy with automatic TLS, basic auth, and rate limiting\n\nInstall OpenClaw and authenticate access using the basic auth credentials\n\nWe'll cover running OpenClaw on a VPS first. In a follow-up, we'll tackle Mac mini deployments with secure remote access (think Tailscale, but entirely self-hosted).\n\nWe'll also add smart rate limiting: anyone who sends more than 5 unauthorized requests within 120 seconds is blocked for 1 minute. The clever part? They'll see a 401 Unauthorized instead of 429 Too Many Requests, so attackers won't even know they've been rate-limited.\n\nYou'll need two checklist items to get started:\n\nA VPS running anywhere with Ubuntu 24.04, and a public IP address\n\nA domain/subdomain pointing DNS to the VPS public IP\n\nTo see everything in action, visit our live demo link and experiment.\n\nFirst, we'll install the high-performance HAProxy image:\n\nWe now have HAProxy 3.3 installed, with the high-performance AWS-LC library and full ACME support for automatic TLS certificates. Now, we just need to apply the configuration to make it work.\n\nEdit /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg and insert the following lines into the global section. This will set us up to use automatic TLS:\n\nNow let’s add configuration for automatic TLS using Let’s Encrypt. Edit the last line for your own domain:\n\nNext, we'll take care of the basic HAProxy configuration items. Don’t forget to change the line starting with ssl-f-use to use the correct subdomain alias from the my_files section:\n\nChange change-this-password shown in the last line to a strong password!\n\nRestart HAProxy to apply the updated configuration:\n\nNext, edit the HAProxy systemd file to make it automatically write certificates to disk. Run the following command:\n\nYou're now ready to insert the following line under [Service]:\n\nYou're now ready to install OpenClaw:\n\nThat’s it! You can now run the following command:\n\nThis process will give you your personal access token. This is still needed for proper authentication inside OpenClaw itself.\n\nYou can now visit https://subdomain.example.com/?token=<gateway token>. When doing this for the first time, you'll have to provide a username and password.\n\nYou can also configure your macOS app to talk to this OpenClaw instance. Just insert the username and password directly into the Websocket URL, as shown below:\n\nCheck your rate limiting occasionally to see who's knocking at your door:\n\nYou might be surprised how many bots are already scanning for OpenClaw instances. That 401 response is working hard. Any line item where gpc0 is higher than 5 has been limited.\n\nWhat if you accidentally lock yourself out? Simply run this command, where <key> is your IP address:bash:\n\nYou now have an OpenClaw instance that's actually secure, not just \"hopefully secure.\" Here's what's protecting you:\n\nDefense in depth – You're not relying on OpenClaw's young authentication code. HAProxy handles the security layer with battle-tested HTTP Basic Auth that's been protecting production systems for decades.\n\nStealth rate limiting – Attackers hitting your instance will see authentication failures, not rate limit errors. They won't know they've been blocked, which means they'll waste time and resources before giving up.\n\nAutomatic TLS – Let's Encrypt handles your certificates with zero manual intervention. No expired certs, no security warnings, no hassle.\n\nIf you need more authentication methods or additional security layers, check out HAProxy Enterprise load balancer. When you’re ready to control your deployment at scale, using HAProxy Fusion for centralized management, observability, and automation.\n\nJakub Suchy is the Director of Solutions Engineering at HAProxy Technologies, where he designs and prototypes solutions for application delivery and load balancing infrastructure. With his background in Linux infrastructure and Open Source Applications, he specializes in developing innovative approaches to modern application delivery challenges, focusing on micro-services architecture and high-availability systems.\n\nThough KubeCon North America 2024 has officially come to a close, the CNCF's flagship event has left us buzzing with residual excitement. Here's what we've learned throughout those four days.\n\nHAProxy Enterprise 3.2 brings next-generation security intelligence, extends its industry-leading performance, and expands the native routing and integration capabilities in HAProxy Enterprise.\n\nAWS re:Invent 2024 has officially wrapped up, but not everything that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Here are some key takeaways from our five days spent with AWS and app delivery enthusiasts.\n\nTikTok’s web scraper, Bytespider, is reportedly aggressively sucking up content to fuel generative AI models.

    "title": "Wirth's Revenge",
    "description": "Are LLMs the final blow in the war against Wirth's law?",
    "fullText": "In 1995, Turing laureate Niklaus Wirth wrote an essay called A Plea for Lean Software in which he mostly gripes about the state of software at the time. Among these gripes is this claim which Wirth attributes to his colleague Martin Reiser1, though it's become to be known as Wirth's Law:\n\nSoftware is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster.\n\nDoing his best grandpa Simpson impersonation, Wirth complains:\n\nAbout 25 years ago, an interactive text editor could be designed with as\nlittle as 8,000 bytes ofstorage. (Modern program editors request 100 times\nthat much!) An operating system had to manage with 8,000 bytes, and a\ncompiler had to fit into 32 Kbytes, whereas their modern descendants\nrequire megabytes. Has all this inflated software become any faster? On\nthe contrary. Were it not for a thousand times faster hardware, modern\nsoftware would be utterly unusable.\n\nAside from the numbers involved here, which must sound utterly preposterous to the average modern reader, there's a lot to relate to. My 25 year career in software, all of which happened after 1995, was in many ways a story in two parts about Wirth's Law, an action and a reaction.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Wirth's conclusion that nothing of value had been gained for the loss in efficiency. When he laments \"the advent of windows, cut-and-paste strategies, and pop-up menus,\n[..] the replacement of meaningful command words by pretty icons\", he is not properly appreciating the value these features had in making computing accessible to more people, and is focusing too much on their runtime cost. Programmers are often too quick to judge software on its technical merits rather than it's social ones.\n\nWirth passed away 2 years ago, but he was a giant in the field of Computer Science and a huge inspiration to me and to many of my other inspirations. In many ways, my focus on simplicity and my own system design sensibilities find their genesis with him.\n\nWirth's law is so self evidently true that it's been a topic of continuous investigation and rediscovery.\n\nA notable example of this was Dan Luu's great post on input lag back in 2017. He felt that input latency was getting worse over time, so he got a high speed camera and measured the delay between pressing a key and the letter appearing on screen across a lot of different hardware. The lowest latency computer was the Apple 2e from 1983.\n\nInput latency has gone up since 1983 because there is a lot more software involved in the pipeline for handling input. The kind of hardware interrupt based input handling the Apple 2e had is not flexible enough to meet modern requirements, so this additional complexity buys us a lot of value... but it's certainly not free, and if you're not careful, one of the costs is latency.\n\nLuu goes on to write a lot about complexity and simplicity, and makes an interesting observation: the modern systems that fix the latency issue mostly do so not through removing complexity but by adding it. There was a lot of talk about complexity and simplicity at the time, because a huge number of software developers were working on another great tradeoff that had been made, this time in the datacenter: the widespread adoption of cloud computing.\n\nIn 1995, when Wirth wrote his essay, if you wanted to run a new internet company, you could just get a computer and run with it. Amazon didn't launch until July of that year, but it was famously started out of Jeff Bezos' garage.\n\nThe requirements for an internet company were simpler back then. The web wasn't some ubiquitous technology with total population penetration. There were only about 16 million people using it at the time; more people had an SNES than used the internet. Slashdot didn't exist. There was no real expectation of 5 9's 24/7/365 availability, and no opportunity to \"go viral.\"\n\nTo run your company's software, you could build your own datacenter, but this is a complicated task requiring a lot of expertise; you need land, permits, contractors, etc. I wouldn't even know where to start.\n\nYou could buy an existing datacenter, but you'd still need to manage power, backup generators/batteries, air conditioning, fire suppression, racks, maintenance, networking. Again, decades in the software industry, and I can barely build a competent list of requirements. It's a big investment, and there's a lot of opex.\n\nYou could rent a rack in a colo and focus on your compute needs, but those needs could change in an instant. If you plan out costs for 100,000 users and you never gain traction, you've overspent and are burning cash on pointless hardware you could be using to develop your product. If you get hit with a tidal wave of interest, you could be showing people the fail whale for years or miss your opportunity for success entirely.\n\nCloud computing was the era's answer. By 2010, Amazon was out of Jeff's basement and running its own massive datacenters for their online operations. As Steve Yegge wrote in 2010, Bezos had distributed an influential API mandate in 2002 requiring all internal teams to make their services available via an API. By 2006, they had already built a platform that they felt they could release to paying customers in the form of EC2 and S3. AWS let you rent capacity in Amazon's datacenter through a web interface or via direct API calls, billed on granular timescales.\n\nEach step in this pipeline imparts additional cost, but they're all pretty valuable, especially the last step. There are even more steps in that pipeline today, with fully managed services like RDS and IAM which abstract the management of software and Lambda which even further abstract your hardware requirements and allow you to scale (and pay) purely on utilization.\n\nEven though the cost to run software had gone up, the improved accessibility of cloud platforms and the reduction of risky capex led to an explosion in web software. All the while, hardware was racing ahead, making the rented capacity more powerful per unit cost and reducing the per-user cost.\n\nUnfortunately, not every \"Wirth tradeoff\" is sound engineering.\n\nEarly in my career, I was working at a newspaper publisher owned by Condé Nast. I was the lead engineer on one of the company's more forward looking development projects, a Django application that managed local sports results data across dozens of regional newspapers. The application provided a single source of truth for very different users and use cases:\n\nThe print syndication system involved writing some pretty gnarly templates in order to generate feeds that could be understood by their newspaper printing systems. After a while, we noticed a problem. These templates were taking minutes to render and setting the database on fire every night.\n\nIf you've been around the block in software, you might already know the issue. The templates were using an ORM which dynamically loaded foreign key fields on attribute access, so innocent looking loops were doing one database query per iteration. These were complex templates with many nested loops: they were sending hundreds of thousands of database queries per render, many of them just the same query over and over again from a different loop in a different part of the template.\n\nWe could fix some of the terrible performance by pre-loading those fields with a join, but we had a lot of templates, and they were complex enough and the database large enough that this wasn't a realistic path to success. As Dan Luu concludes in his study on latency, the solution that worked required adding more complexity in the form of a smart caching layer.\n\nAlthough we didn't know we were making it when we started the template project, this was a \"bad\" Wirth tradeoff. It still had utility: instead of having to manage what data might be needed in what template carefully, we could grab a list of top level objects and let the ORM fetch the rest of the data we needed on the fly.\n\nThe project started up quickly, but even at a pretty low scale of complexity, it became impossible to execute successfully. Before we realized what the problem was, we were using the convenience of these auto-loaded fields without understanding their true cost, and the software we built was a wasteful monstrosity as a result.\n\nI see the same thing happening now but at broader scale with LLMs, and I feel myself sympathizing more and more with Wirth's cane shaking wrath.\n\nProgramming is the act of getting a computer to do something for you. Many people are discovering that for the first time, thanks to LLMs, they can ask a computer to do something for them, and it will actually go and do it. However, limiting yourself to programming only through this approach poses some problems.\n\nWhile they might not be the unbound ecological disaster that many of their detractors claim they are, LLMs are still intensely computationally expensive. You can ask an AI what 2 * 3 is and for the low price of several seconds of waiting, a few milliliters of water and enough power to watch 5% of a TikTok video on a television, it will tell you. But the computer you have in front of you can perform this calculation a billion times per second.\n\nIf the problem of my accidental database denial of service syndication feed was down to ignorance over the costs of ORM usage, it's pretty obvious that a similar kind of ignorance can lead to enormous unintended costs once we start integrating LLMs into our automation.\n\nI've seen a few instances of this out in the wild that lead me to believe that this trap might be particularly tricky to avoid. Despite the capacity for LLMs to educate, or simulate education, or at least point you towards related materials some of which may be real, that's not how laypeople use them.\n\nThey present the LLM with a problem and ask it solve that problem.\n\nOne example of this is from myself, as this is how I used LLMs in my first go, too. I had a dump of recipes from a great but sadly unmaintained recipe site that I wanted to import into a self-hosted recipe management app.\n\nI thought \"Well, this sounds tedious, let me ask an LLM to do this.\" So I pointed a local LLM to the specification for the destination format, and asked it to convert the files. It converted one file every 10 minutes, inaccurately and without proper formatting. It was slow and it produced trash.\n\nWhen you see engineers heap praise on programming agents, this isn't how they are using them. You don't ask the LLM to perform a repetitive and precise task, you ask it to build a script that performs that task. Except in rare cases, this script does not itself use LLMs.\n\nIronically, if you have the foresight to describe this problem to a major AI model and ask it how you should use an AI to solve it, this is exactly what it will tell you to do.\n\nThis approach subtly different from the way you might use LLMs for many other tasks, but it's crucial to getting results that reliably get a computer to do something for you. LLMs don't do reliable, they don't do repeatable. Building a program allows you to iterate on a deterministic solution with a stable source of truth, and you come away with an artifact that may or not be useless, but which actually works, and in my case converts 70 files/sec.\n\nAnother example I came across was this twitter thread by BenjaminDEKR, which I saw being ridiculed on bsky. He asked his personal agent to remind him to get milk, and this led the agent to repeatedly ask Opus if it was daytime yet. Along with the context from his heartbeat file, this resulted in a $0.75 charge for each heartbeat, costing him almost $20 during a single night's sleep.\n\nMaybe you decide that for your purposes 00:00 is night and 08:00 is day and use a basic local gettimeofday call to determine which span you're in. Maybe you're unsatisfied with anything other than astronomical day/night and can generate a sunrise/sunset table for the year using NOAA's unmaintained solar calculator to dynamically produce your day/night spans?\n\nYou could do these things, but not if asking the LLM to solve problems is your problem solving approach. If asking an LLM is the only way you know how to solve problems, then you optimize the question asking by reducing heartbeat frequency and running on a cheaper model. Problem solved!\n\nThe overall concern is that having a magic box that gives you the answers ends up being a thought terminating solution to any problem.\n\nWhen I wrote about the ecological impacts of AI, one of the non-ecological impacts I cited was the possibility that \"AI erodes human skill.\" A recent release by research fellows at Anthropic, \"How AI Impacts Skill Formation\", suggests this fear isn't unfounded:\n\nWe find that AI use impairs conceptual understanding, code reading, and debugging abilities, without delivering significant efficiency gains on average.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was at a family gathering watching some of the kids go through a huge backlog of red envelopes that their grandparents had saved for them over various missed holidays. They were pulling out all of the cash, at which point they were going to tally it all up and split it evenly.\n\nWhen the adults challenged them to come up with better counting strategies, one of them suggested they could throw all of the money on the floor, take a picture, and ask ChatGPT to tally it all.\n\nThe instincts are for people to get the AI to do work for them, not to learn from the AI how to do the work themselves.\n\nWirth's law posits that software can erase gains faster than hardware can make them, but I'm afraid the reality is much worse than that.\n\nIf you've studied computer science, you might have heard of a function called Busy Beaver. The name is unfortunately silly, but it's a fairly important thought experiment in computability. BB(N) is defined as the maximum number of steps a terminating turing machine with N states can run.\n\nThis function is known to be noncomputable, because any algorithm that could compute it would be able to solve the halting problem, which is known to be undecidable. BB(1..3) were known in the 1960s to be 1, 6, and 21. In a pleasant bit of symmetry with Dan Luu's experiments, BB(4) was discovered to be 107 in 1983, the same year his Apple 2e was built. In 2024, BB(5) was proven to be 47,176,870.\n\nAs N grows, BB is known to eventually outgrow any computable sequence, including famous fast-growing sequences like TREE(). BB(6) has a lower bound that is so large that it is impossible to explain how large it is to someone without a significant background in mathematics.\n\nSoftware has an unprecedented capability to produce a correct answer in the most resource consuming way possible. Of course, producing incorrect answers or no answer at all is also an option.\n\nDespite the apparent truth of Wirth's law, engineers have been actively battling against it for decades, but I worry that with LLMs we might have lost the war.\n\nAm I just the latest in a long line of engineers who can't appreciate the newfound democratization of programming, or have we crossed into a \"bad\" Wirth tradeoff, where the growth curve of runtime complexity is something that hardware advancements cannot possibly dig us back out of?",

    "fullText": "Six key initiatives are highlighted, offering an insight into the future of NFC tech\n\n2 February 2026 – NFC Forum, the global standards body for Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, has today announced its latest roadmap for the development of NFC Forum Standards and its corresponding technical capabilities. New topics to be progressed over the forthcoming years include faster data rates, end-to-end application testing, and security advancements. Additionally, ongoing work will continue to evolve the NFC Wireless Charging offer, advance multipurpose tap and explore new digital key requirements.\n\nThe roadmap was collaboratively developed by the NFC Forum Board members - including representatives from Apple, Google, Huawei, Identiv, Infineon, NuCurrent, NXP Semiconductors, Sony, and ST Microelectronics - in consultation with the NFC Forum membership and industry partners to ensure anticipated market requirements are addressed.\n\nThe six key roadmap priorities include:\n\nFaster Data Rates. Exploring the potential to increase the standardized current rate at which data can be transferred between two devices by up to eight times, delivering a smoother and more responsive NFC user experience.\n\nImproving Reader Mode Interoperability. Providing end-to-end interoperability testing to confirm that new and updated applications successfully and consistently operate on NFC Forum Certified Devices, improving NFC Reader Mode reliability across all use cases.\n\nSecurity Advancements. Publishing NFC Forum’s first-ever NFC Controllers Security Profile, as well as looking to future proof NFC security protocols against Post Quantum Computing threats and strengthening NFC against relay-based attacks.\n\nWireless Power Evolution. Commencing work on the next generation of NFC Forum Wireless Charging Specifications to define device category specific profiles, support devices with multiple wireless charging receivers, and deliver higher charging power levels.\n\nMulti-Purpose Tap. Defining the technical proposals required to bring the concept of supporting several actions with a single ‘tap’ to market. This includes the ability of the NFC Reader to specify and request the specific credentials needed to perform a user action.\n\nDigital Keys. Exploring innovative new digital key experiences to ensure NFC Forum Standards support a range of industry requirements.\n\nMike McCamon, Executive Director of NFC Forum, comments: “NFC is a well-established and trusted foundational technology for countless devices and use cases across almost every market. To ensure that each of these deployments work in the seamless manner that customers expect from NFC, it is vital that the NFC Forum develops global standards that deliver true industry harmonization. Furthermore, to enable these standards to be adopted and applied at scale, it is equally important that all NFC stakeholders are aware of our plans and engage with NFC Forum in our development processes. This approach ensures future evolutions continue to align with both their current NFC use cases as well as their long-term ambitions.”\n\nNFC Forum last released a Technology Roadmap in 2023. A key element of this was increasing operating volumes and advancing its specifications to support the Digital Product Passport requirements. Both these ambitions were delivered as part of NFC Release 15 in June 2025.\n\n“For more than 20 years, NFC Forum has empowered organizations to create innovative contactless experiences backed by intuitive, reliable and consistent NFC open standards,” adds Mike. “The active engagement in the evolution of NFC technology from an ever-increasing number of industries is testament to the clear value it provides to users globally. As we accelerate across the arc of contactless towards inevitable ubiquity, we encourage discussion and welcome new contributions from across the ecosystem.”\n\nLearn more about the 2026 NFC Forum Technology Roadmap.\n\nThe Roadmap will be discussed in more detail in our upcoming webinar on February 26. Registrations are now open.",

    "fullText": "The team behind Frappe & ERPNext\n\nOver my recent vacation, I got a chance to meet Rushabh Mehta, Founder, and CEO of Frappe Technologies & ERPNext Foundation.\n\nFrappe is a unique company run by a smart and courageous founder and his team. I discovered them while building an ERP system and used a part of their code to manage taxes.\n\nI knew I had to meet Rushabh when I found that:\n\nI didn’t know him and had no common connections. If you’d like to know my approach, leave a comment down below and I might write a story about that. Long story short, I emailed him and he was kind enough to meet me for an hour.\n\nI wanted to know why he open sourced ERPNext and how did the company achieve financial viability.\n\nOn reaching the Frappe office in Mumbai, I immediately got a vibe of a company in its growth phase. It was a clean hall with a meeting room and huge windows. From what I observed, I can bet that Frappe is close to their customers and their product has found a market fit.\n\nRushabh Mehta, Founder & CEO of Frappe Technologies\n\nIt was 10 minutes after the scheduled time when Rushabh actually arrived. He had not confirmed the invitation to meet, didn’t respond to my emails on the day, and we had never spoken on the phone.\n\nIn fact, I didn’t even have his number. I had my doubts that I’d be sent back without a meeting. I wasn’t. He was just occupied and wasn’t able to respond to my messages. He had a very positive vibe.\n\nAfter exchanging pleasantries and a casual introduction to who I was and what I did, I started asking him tough questions.\n\nI have taken the liberty to paraphrase the responses while trying to keep the essence preserved.\n\nRushabh: Our family business was automating their furniture manufacturing process. The factory and the office were almost 150kms apart and both units had their own implementations of a famous ERP.\n\nQuote Dialogue Illustration by Freepik\n\nThe problem was that they were out of sync. A bunch of files containing invoices and other docs was manually delivered to the office every day. Here an operator manually entered this data to the office ERP so the systems stay in sync.\n\nThe first module I created was an online invoice system.\n\nDid you intentionally make Frappe open sourced or it happened accidentally?\n\nPython was my first introduction to the OS community. Frappe couldn’t be otherwise. This was the pre-Github era where communities didn’t exist as they do today. I just uploaded the source on Google Code. The project didn’t have any traction. Only a dead mailing list and me continuously pushing code.\n\nDoes open source attract competition or creates a barrier to entry for new incumbents?\n\nBoth. There is always the risk of big players like AWS taking what you built and wrapping it into a managed service. It’s more of an ideology than a business plan. There are only a few examples of successful open source companies, like RedHat.\n\nThere is a shift in open source culture too. Companies are moving from “open source in spirit” to more of a “visible source” model that restricts Amazon fro blatantly packaging their work as a service.\n\nWhat is your mode of financial stability?\n\nWe are inspired by the RedHat model, that is to provide bespoke consultancy around our core open source solution. That is what we are majorly working on. There are other independent companies that provide consultancy for ERPNext but we become the preferred vendor due to our authorship.\n\nQuote Dialogue Illustration by Freepik\n\nThe other source of revenue is our hosted solution.\n\nWe don’t precisely track it but our guess is that we host about 20% of all ERPNext deployments. 80% of our instances are self-hosted. One of our partners self-host ERPNext for over 1500 of their employees. The very fact they are self-hosted is an accolade to ERPNext’s usability.\n\nWe are also looking towards tie-ups with public organizations. We are currently in the process of closing our largest client yet. If everything works out, we’d be managing around 30000 employees for that organization in a single instance.\n\nWhat’s ERPNext’s acquisition channel? Do you run traditional ad-campaigns?\n\nIt’s mostly organic and referral. We did initially spend money on ads. Our first signup came from Google Adwords.\n\nDoes open source attract better talent?\n\nAbsolutely. People approach us all the time. Our new hires who were unaware of our model before the joined, tend to appreciate and get excited about our open source model.\n\nI cannot draw a contrast between the quality of talent we’d attract if we were a regular company. But I feel that we find and retain good people due to our model.\n\nWhat motivates you? What’s the big problem you are trying to solve?\n\nThere is no grand narrative. You just pick a fight. And you get better at it.\n\nLike the scene from Matrix 3 where Neo keeps relentless keeps fighting Smith and his clones. That’s what I do on a daily basis. My job is to fix anything that stops my team from moving forward. It could be fixing a failed instance, talking to that client, taking out the trash, cleaning the washroom.\n\nI have picked up the fight of providing seamless, Apple-like precisions and user experience to businesses.\n\nThere is no grand narrative, pick a fight.\n\nWhat sectors according to you are currently underserved? Sectors that have a high probability to get big in the coming years…\n\nEverything. We are in the continuous process of build-up and breakdown. It would have been impossible to think about community platforms like StackOverflow or Wikipedia a few years ago.\n\nThey practically should not exist, but they do. As I said before, pick a fight. Build a search engine. Google is an evil company and search is far from being solved.\n\nAbout ideas, do you think that India as a country tends to pursue less risky hypothesis? Do you think we are lacking radical innovations?\n\nWe tend to profit on arbitrage. That’s what TCS (one of India’s biggest tech companies with valuation comparable to Facebook) does. Over the years, we have developed a runbook to build a $5million business niche by creating software in India and selling it to western countries, mainly North America. Although saturated, this runbook can be used to serve more niches, but Indian ideas tend to be less radical.\n\nThe west has seen some crazy ideas grow. That creates spare funds to invest in new, equally crazy ideas and the cycle continues. This cycle has not picked pace in India.\n\nWe also talked about alternative schooling, past clients, current problems and future visions. When done, Rushabh kindly invited me for Samosa and Chai (Indian snacks).\n\nIf you are looking for an ERP, you might want to check out ERPNext.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this and many thanks to Rushabh for talking to me.\n\nI make things. Mostly software, but sometimes clothes, courses, videos, or essays.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge said Tuesday that he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon's censuring of a sitting U.S. senator who joined a videotaped plea for troops to resist unlawful orders from the Trump administration.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly had a front-row seat in a courtroom as his attorneys urged U.S. District Judge Richard Leon to block the Pentagon from punishing the Arizona Democrat, a retired U.S. Navy pilot. Leon didn't immediately rule from the bench on Kelly's claims that Pentagon officials violated his First Amendment free speech rights.\n\nBut the judge appeared to be skeptical of key arguments that a government attorney made in defense of Kelly's Jan. 5 censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\n“You're asking me to do something the Supreme Court has never done,” the judge told Justice Department attorney John Bailey. “Isn't that a bit of a stretch?”\n\nBailey argued that Congress decided that retired military service members are subject to the same Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to active-duty troops.\n\n“Retirees are part of the armed forces,” Bailey said. “They are not separated from the services.”\n\nBenjamin Mizer, one of Kelly's lawyers, said they aren't aware of any ruling to support the notion that military retirees have “diminished speech rights.” And he argued that the First Amendment clearly protects Kelly's speech in this case.\n\n“And any other approach would be to make new law,” Mizer added.\n\nLeon, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush, said the Pentagon's actions against Kelly could have a chilling effect on “many, many other retirees who wish to voice their opinion.”\n\nThe judge said he hopes to issue a ruling by next Wednesday. Kelly shook hands with two government attorneys after the hearing.\n\nIn November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later. Hegseth said Kelly’s censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from the senator’s retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay.\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Sen. Elissa Slotkin. Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence communities.\n\nThe Pentagon began investigating Kelly in late November, citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court-martial or other punishment.\n\nHegseth has said Kelly was the only one of the six lawmakers to be investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.",

    "description": "A 34-year-old woman who posed as a Boston high school student befriended children ages 13 to 16, telling them she had a foster mother and convincing them they were helping her with personal issues.",
    "fullText": "The 34-year-old woman who posed as a student at several different Boston Public Schools tricked children into believing she was their friend and left them emotionally scarred, a former high school student who met the woman said on Tuesday.\n\n“It just makes me hard to trust people ... (it makes me question) is it this person, or is this just like another Shelby,” said Janelle Lamons, a former student at Burke High School, who was friends with an adult woman she thought was her age during the 2022-23 academic school year.\n\n“Moving forward, I think a lot of students are going to continue to feel betrayal,” Lamons said. “Even though it happened three years ago, they would never forget how that made them feel at that time.”\n\nShelby Hewitt, 34, pleaded guilty in Suffolk County Superior Court on Tuesday to identity fraud, violating the standards of conduct for a public employee and three counts of forgery of a document. Three other charges were dismissed as part of the plea agreement.\n\nShe was ordered to serve four years of probation for each guilty plea, which will be served concurrently, and pay more than $9,000 in restitution. Her trial scheduled for next week was therefore canceled.\n\nUnder her probation, Hewitt must continue her mental health treatment and prescribed medications, stay away from the child whose identity she stole while the child was in Department of Children and Families custody. She also must stay away from all Boston Public Schools, cannot be employed as a social worker and is not allowed to seek a social work license.\n\nAfter her guilty plea, Hewitt apologized to the courtroom and said she was “deeply sorry for the pain I caused,” acknowledging her actions “caused confusion, alarm and probably fear for students, families and staff.”\n\n“I should never have been there ... I violated the trust of the school community, my family and everybody in my life that loved me,” Hewitt said. She added she carries “shame every day” and “was not being a good person,” but is continuing her mental health treatment “to try to be a better one.”\n\nHewitt, who is college and graduate-school educated, is a former social worker with the Department of Children and Families, most recently from Dec. 2021 until Feb. 2023. She took on two different identities when she was posing as a student — one of them being the identity of an actual child in DCF care, prosecutors said.\n\n“Both systems which she undermined are systems ... designed to care and protect children,” Assistant District Attorney Ursula Knight said on Tuesday.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Hewitt — who was in her early 30s at the time — enrolled herself as a 16-year-old in the ninth grade at Burke High School, prosecutors said. She then requested a transfer to Brighton High School and at the beginning of June 2023, enrolled herself again under a different name at English High School.\n\nShe also created false DCF social worker identities, complete with a fake state website domain and profiles, in order to enroll herself as a student, according to prosecutors.\n\nDuring her time attending classes at the Boston schools, Hewitt posed as a child in need of special education services. She also enrolled for eating disorder care at Walden Behavioral Treatment Center, through her false DCF social worker profiles.\n\nHewitt made friends with students ages 13 through 16, telling them she was from Colombia and had a foster mother, Lamons said. These children were “very real” victims of her actions, Judge Debra Squires-Lee told Hewitt, who “thought you were their friend, thought they were helping you with your issues” and “have been harmed.”\n\nOutside the courtroom, Hewitt refused to tell reporters why she chose to pose as a student. Her lawyer, Timothy Flaherty, said she’s “a young woman with significant mental health concerns” and a “lifetime of emotional issues dominating bad decisions.”\n\nBut to Lamons and her mother, Robin Williams, probation is not enough.\n\n“For her to have probation — that’s an insult ... she is a monster,” Williams said. She is looking for a conversation with Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, BPS Superintendent Mary Skipper and Gov. Maura Healey on the situation, she said.\n\n“We all need to come together and find a better solution, to make sure that this does not happen again, and make sure that the kids are safe,” Williams said.\n\nSpencer shopping plaza barricaded suspect dead; officer and person shot\n\nBarricaded suspect at Spencer shopping plaza killed in shootout with police; officer shot\n\nChicago-based rap manager on trial for alleged conspiracy to bankroll elite lifestyle\n\nMinor charged with attempted murder after fight in Ipswich leads to stabbing\n\nMurder suspect wanted in Mass. arrested as fugitive in Maine",

    "description": "These elderly aircraft were already slated to be pulled out of the air in the next few years anyway; it's now obvious that they should have been pulled already.",
    "fullText": "After the horrific crash of a 34-year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-11 flown by UPS in November, the shipping giant has taken the reasonable step of sending all its MD-11s into permanent retirement. These elderly aircraft were already slated to be pulled out of the air in the next few years anyway; it's now obvious that they should have been pulled already. UPS will take a $137 million hit in the process.\n\nThe loss will put a strain on UPS's operations, as MD-11s accounted for 9% of the company's air fleet, according to NBC News. The world is also facing a dire shortage of cargo planes in general, as planemakers like Boeing and Airbus prioritize passenger airliners over freighters in their production schedules. In fact, that production squeeze is a big part of the reason why more and more cargo companies are keeping their planes in the air long past the typical retirement age of 25 years. That continues to be a risk, and the devastating consequences are now clear.\n\nMeanwhile, FedEx is claiming for the moment that it will patch up its MD-11s and get them back into the air once the FAA lifts its post-crash grounding order. According to Simple Flying, FedEx has 58 such planes in its fleet; Western Global Airlines has a further 14. Every MD-11 is a grizzled ancient, originally made by a company that was long ago acquired by Boeing. Now that UPS has made its move, expect there to be pressure on these companies to follow suit.\n\nHopefully, UPS won't be operating with a reduced fleet for long. It ought to be getting 18 Boeing 767 freighters in the next 15 months. Though this is a decades-old model, the actual planes will be fresh out of the factory. But Boeing has over 5,000 planes on backorder, many of which are passenger airliners, which are also badly needed to replace aging planes. Demand for air services is just surging past production capacity, and this situation looks like it's getting worse, not better.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "The Roman diocese headed by Chicago-born Pope Leo XIV has ordered a church in Rome to fix a fresco of an angel that was updated to bear a suspicious resemblance to one of President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Europe.\n\nAn Italian newspaper noticed over the weekend that a newly restored fresco at the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Lucina in downtown Rome suddenly featured an angel whose face looked a lot like Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party.\n\nThe artist, Bruno Valentinetti, has denied modeling the angel after the prime minister, but the Roman diocese expressed its “disappointment” and vowed to investigate. On Monday, technicians from the diocese told the parish priest the painting needed to be changed to remove Meloni’s likeness, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported.\n\nAs pope, the 70-year-old Leo is also the Bishop of Rome.\n\nOriginally, the Basilica San Lorenzo parish priest, Daniele Micheletti, had defended the fresco, saying he didn’t think there was anything wrong with Valentinetti painting the premier’s likeness on an angel in a chapel dedicated to “holy souls.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean we’re Meloni supporters,” he told La Repubblica on Saturday. “Maybe we are Meloni supporters, but we don’t say so. The face of King Umberto II is also there, does that mean we’re monarchists?”\n\nBut the Roman diocese’s cardinal vicar, Leo’s close ally Baldassare Reina, responded to the news with a “firm” statement that “images of sacred art and the Christian tradition can be misused or exploited, as they are intended exclusively to support liturgical life.”\n\nAfter speaking to the diocese, Micheletti said the fresco would be modified. Archivists are looking for documentation of the original version of the fresco, which Valentinetti himself painted in 2000 within the historic basilica, which dates back to the 13th century.\n\nPope Leo has been an outspoken critic of many of Trump’s policies, including the president’s hardline immigration tactics and threats to invade foreign countries.\n\nHe shared some of those disagreements with the administration directly during a May sit-down with Vice President JD Vance, and has made a point of distancing himself from his older brother’s pro-MAGA politics.\n\nIn November, a White House spokesperson slammed Leo for saying that detained migrants should be allowed to receive communion.",

    "fullText": "Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that \"aggressively\" approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, ​the U.S. military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.\n\nThe incident came as diplomats sought ‌to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned that with U.S. warships heading ‌toward Iran, \"bad things\" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.\n\nOil futures prices rose more than $1 per barrel after news the drone was shot down.\n\nThe Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier \"with unclear intent\" and was shot down by an F-35 U.S. fighter jet, the U.S. military said.\n\n\"An F-35C fighter jet from ⁠Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian ‌drone in self-defense and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,\" said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the U.S. military's Central Command.\n\nIran's U.N. ‍mission declined to comment.\n\nIran's Tasnim news agency said connection had been lost with a drone in international waters, but the reason was unknown.\n\nNo American service members were harmed during the incident and no U.S. equipment was damaged, he added.\n\nThe Lincoln ​carrier strike group is the most visible part of a U.S. military buildup in the Middle East ‌following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.\n\nTrump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was \"seriously talking,\" while Tehran's top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way.\n\nIRANIAN BOATS HARASS U.S.-FLAGGED TANKER\n\nIn ⁠a separate incident on Tuesday in the Strait of ​Hormuz, just hours after the drone shootdown, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard ​Corps forces harassed a U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed merchant vessel, according to the U.S. military.\n\n\"Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and ‍threatened to board and seize ⁠the tanker,\" Hawkins said.\n\nMaritime risk management group Vanguard said the Iranian boats ordered the tanker to stop its engine and prepare to be boarded.

    "description": "Scenarios like this can be avoided.",
    "fullText": "A well-meaning irrigation project unintentionally created ideal conditions for a hybrid pig population to grow. Now, one of India's largest protected areas faces serious ecological and human safety concerns.\n\nAn invasive species — a hybrid of domestic pig and wild boar — is disrupting the fragile ecosystem of the Desert National Park in Rajasthan, Deccan Herald reported.\n\nThe hybrid pigs began appearing in the park after a canal project brought in permanent water sources and crops, turning the arid desert into a habitat that allowed the pig population to grow rapidly. In the past two decades, they've become opportunistic predators and competitors, endangering local plants and animals.\n\nFarmers have reported crop damage and attacks on livestock — and even humans. Bustards and vultures are also now at risk, as the invasive pigs eat the eggs of ground-nesting birds and the carcasses that serve as food for scavengers.\n\nManas Shukla, a wildlife researcher at the DNP, said, \"The invasive pigs are becoming a major competitor of threatened vulture populations over food that can further impact these declining species,\" as published in Deccan Herald.\n\nThis issue raises two concerns: the impact of invasive species on ecosystems and the consequences of human intervention in natural environments.\n\nAbout 2 in 5 threatened or endangered species are at risk due to invasive species, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They bring harm by outcompeting, preying on, or spreading diseases. They also disrupt food chains and destroy habitats — altering entire ecosystems.\n\nIn many cases, human activity is what brings these invasive species to new environments. Travel and trade are common culprits, but so is changing land use. And it's not just deforestation and urbanization; converting land for agricultural use also opens it to exploitation from invasive species.\n\nThe United Nations shared that human activity has already altered approximately 70% of the world's ice-free land — often in ways that unintentionally reshape local habitats. In places like Rajasthan, these shifts can leave native species more vulnerable as food sources disappear, nesting sites decline, and competition increases.\n\nForest officials have removed the pigs from bustard enclosures, but have yet to enforce large-scale control measures, citing wildlife protection laws. However, researchers argue that the invasive pigs are hybrids — not native wildlife — and should be controlled or translocated to protect the local ecosystem.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nScenarios like this can be avoided by limiting human intervention, such as building infrastructure or bringing in artificial water sources, that unintentionally favor invasive animals. Native populations decline not necessarily because they are weaker, but because the ecosystems they have adapted to have changed and allowed invasive species to proliferate.\n\nIndividuals can help reduce these risks by supporting conservation policies and restoration efforts. They can also rewild their yard or upgrade to a natural lawn — steps that protect native species while also strengthening community safety, reducing wildlife conflict, and supporting local food systems.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "In a congressional hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) read aloud text messages from an immigration agent who bragged about shooting a Chicago woman last year.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Customs and Border Protection agent Charles Exum shot Marimar Martinez five times in Brighton Park during the Department of Homeland Security’s Operation Midway Blitz, an immigration crackdown. DHS claimed Martinez had rammed Exum and other agents, which prompted them “to fire defensively.” The Department of Justice indicted Martinez, but ultimately the charges were dismissed after the government admitted in court that the ramming had not occurred.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Democrats held a hearing about the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown in places such as Chicago and Minnesota. Martinez gave a harrowing account of the incident.\n\n“After being at the hospital for less than three hours, I was discharged from the hospital into custody of the FBI. As we left the hospital, I was escorted out through the back in a wheelchair. I observed over dozens of Border Patrol agents waiting outside the hospital,” Martinez said. “One of the agents came up to me with his cell phone and took a photograph of me. It was the same agent who had previously kept coming in and out [of my hospital] room, and I had to repeatedly tell him to leave.”\n\nLater in the hearing, Garcia read texts from Exum about the shooting. The messages were displayed on placards behind him:\n\nMs. Martinez, these are images of texts sent by the agent who shot you. And they’re actually disturbing to read, but I think it’s important for the public to see this. The agent linked an article about your shooting and texted, “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes. I fired 7 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book, boys… Oh, well, it is what it is. Sh*t happens.”\n\nThis is someone that works for the United States government.\n\nThe hearing also featured testimony from Luke Granger and Brent Granger, the brothers of Renee Good, who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross last month in Minneapolis. Two weeks after her killing, Border Patrol agent Jesus Ochoa and Customs and Border Protection officer Raymundo Gutierrez shot and killed Alex Pretti in the city.\n\nThe post Congressman Reads Texts From Border Agent Who Bragged About Shooting Chicago Woman: ‘5 Shots, 7 Holes’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Sustainable smartphone takes a step forward with modular accessories, a good screen and mid-range performance\n\nThe Dutch ethical smartphone brand Fairphone is back with its six-generation Android, aiming to make its repairable phone more modern, modular, affordable and desirable, with screw-in accessories and a user-replaceable battery.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 costs £499 (€599), making it cheaper than previous models and pitting it squarely against budget champs such as the Google Pixel 9a and the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, while being repairable at home with long-term software support and a five-year warranty. On paper it sounds like the ideal phone to see out the decade.\n\nThe new Fairphone is slicker than its predecessors, with a modern, 6.3in 120Hz OLED screen on the front and a recycled plastic body that feels solid and high quality. It looks great in its off-white colour as tested, but also comes in green or black. The phone is resistant against rain and splashes but not immersion, so don’t drop it in a bath or swimming pool.\n\nThe back plate is held in place by two exposed Torx screws and hides the battery and other modular components, which can simply be unscrewed and replaced at home if needed.\n\nThe power button doubles as fingerprint scanner, but it is quite slim; and being flush with the side makes the task of pressing it harder than necessary. Unfortunately, the volume buttons are directly opposite the power button and precisely where you place your fingers for grip, which leads to frequent accidental presses that trigger either unwanted screenshots or the power-off and restart menu. They are also very easy to hit accidentally when pulling the phone out of a pocket, ramping up the volume unnecessarily.\n\nAbove the power button on the right side is a big, colourful switch that turns on Fairphone’s “Moments” minimalist interface, which blocks notifications and swaps the standard Android home screen for a simple list of essential apps. It’s a smart idea for those hoping to reduce distractions. But swiping up to exit an app shows the regular home screen for a split second, making it feel like a hack. The switch can be repurposed for other features, including activating “do not disturb” or the torch.\n\nScreen: 6.31in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (431ppi)\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3\n\nCamera: 50MP main, 13MP ultrawide, 32MP selfie\n\nConnectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSS\n\nWater resistance: IP55 (splash/rain)\n\nDimensions: 156.5 x 73.3 x 9.6mm\n\nThe Fairphone 6 has the same mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip as the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, which can’t rival the best phones for raw power but generally feels fast enough in use. It will handle light gaming and most tasks but will struggle with more advanced titles. The phone has 256GB of storage and a rare microSD card slot for adding more.\n\nThe battery life is reasonable if not remarkable, lasting about 35 hours between charges with the screen actively used for about four to five hours across 5G and wifi. The Fairphone should see out most heavy-use days, but will need charging nightly.\n\nThe battery will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles and it can be replaced at home using a single screwdriver, along with the rest of the 12 modular components. Batteries cost £35, screens £78 and the main camera £61. The phone was awarded 10 out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit.\n\nThe handset is made with 50% recycled or fair materials, and Fairphone publishes its lifecycle report.\n\nThe phone either runs regular Android 15 with Google services, as reviewed, or a privacy-focused, open-source version of Android, without Google services, called /e/OS. Unfortunately, that means the Fairphone 6 isn’t running the latest version of Android 16, but it will be supported with updates until 2033, which is about a year longer than the best mainstream phones.\n\nThe software is generally uncluttered with little in the way of customisation, which for the most part is a good thing. But it is a little rough around the edges and lacks a few of the bells and whistles that Samsung, Google and others add to their software.\n\nIt is notably devoid of the artificial intelligence that has been shoved in every crevice by other phone manufacturers. It has Google’s Gemini chatbot assistant, but without the ability to activate it via voice while the phone is locked. The Fairphone also misses out on Google’s excellent Circle to Search feature common to most other phones, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nRecent updates have fixed some of the bugs, including one in which the screen stuttered and stalled after being turned on from standby. But the software still lacks the level of polish you should expect.\n\nThe Fairphone has two cameras on the back and one selfie camera in the screen. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good photos in bright light, but it struggles with high contrast scenes, often misjudging the white balance or looking washed out. The night mode is usable but not as good as you’d expect from a modern smartphone.\n\nThe 2x digital zoom is reasonable but stretching to 10x causes the photos to become full of artefacts. The 13MP ultrawide camera produces pretty good photos in decent light, with solid detail in the middle of the frame even if they are a little soft at the edges. The macrophotography mode can produce great closeup images with a bit of practice, and the 32MP selfie camera takes good photos for the money.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 easily has the best camera the company has made and gets the job done, but it can’t hold a candle to similarly priced rivals.\n\nThe Fairphone Gen 6 costs £499 (€599).\n\nFor comparison, Google’s Pixel 9a costs £499, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro costs £449 and the Apple iPhone 16e costs £599.\n\nThe sixth-generation Fairphone takes the company further into the mainstream with a solid, mid-range Android with all the perks of a modular, repairable and more ethical design.\n\nIt trades a few premium features for a lower price than its predecessors, but still has a good screen, great looks and reasonable battery life. It even has a microSD card slot for adding more storage, which is incredibly rare in 2026.\n\nThe camera is serviceable, though far from the best you can get for the money. The software is basic Android 15, which is unfortunately not the latest version, a little rough around the edges and devoid of AI tricks other than Google’s Gemini chatbot. But Fairphone is slowly fixing bugs and will provide support until 2033. The distraction-free Moments mode switch is a good idea, too. The chip is fast enough now, but it isn’t the most powerful and may become pretty tired after eight years of use.\n\nThe fingerprint scanner is not the best and the power and volume button placement is an irritating design flaw. While few phones offer as repair-friendly a design, more mainstream devices offer almost as long software support as the Fairphone.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 is the best, least-compromised phone the company has made. But things have improved in the rest of the industry, with better access to repair and longer software support, making the Fairphone tough to recommend for everyone over mainstream devices.\n\nPros: modular accessory support, repairable-at-home design, software support to 2033, recycled and fair materials, microSD card slot, good screen, five-year warranty,\n\nCons: mid-range performance, fingerprint scanner and volume button placement annoying, average camera, cannot be submerged in water, no Android 16 yet and software is a little rough around the edges.",

    "fullText": "Pedro Sánchez says urgent action needed to protect children from ‘digital wild west’, drawing anger from owner of X\n\nSpain has proposed a ban on social media use by teenagers as attitudes hardened in Europe against the technology, drawing personal insults against the prime minister from Elon Musk.\n\nThe government is preparing a series of measures including a social media ban for under-16s, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said, promising to protect children from the “digital wild west” and hold tech companies responsible for hateful and harmful content.\n\nSánchez said on Tuesday that urgent action was needed because social media was a “failed state where laws are ignored and crimes are tolerated”.\n\nHe also took Musk to task for using X to “amplify disinformation” over his administration’s decision last week to regularise 500,000 undocumented workers and asylum seekers, pointing out that Musk was himself a migrant.\n\nMusk wrote on X in response: “Dirty Sánchez is a tyrant and a traitor to the people of Spain.” About an hour and a half later, he escalated his criticism, posting on X: “Sánchez is the true fascist totalitarian.”\n\nRepresentatives of Google, part of Alphabet, TikTok, Snapchat and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Spain’s proposed measures.\n\nGreece is also close to announcing a similar ban for children under 15, a senior government source said.\n\nSpain and Greece look set to join countries such as Britain and France in considering tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to such platforms for children younger than 16.\n\nGovernments and regulators worldwide are looking at the impact of children’s screen time on their development and mental wellbeing.\n\n“Our children are exposed to a space they were never meant to navigate alone … We will no longer accept that,” Sanchez said at the World Governments Summit in Dubai. “We will protect them from the digital wild west.”\n\nSpain joins five other European countries that he called the “coalition of the digitally willing” to coordinate and enforce cross-border regulation, Sanchez said, without naming the countries, set to hold their first meeting in the coming days.\n\n“We know that this is a battle that far exceeds the boundaries of any country,” he said. His office did not respond to a request for clarification.\n\nLegislation to ban children under 15 from social media is passing through France’s parliament. Britain is also considering similar measures.\n\nSpain’s proposed regulation would give parents clear backing to set limits and would ease social pressure for children worried about missing out, said Diana Diaz, director of the ANAR Foundation for at-risk children and adolescents.\n\nThe recent explosion of AI-generated content, and public outcry over reports of Musk’s Grok AI chatbot generating non-consensual sexual images, including of minors, has fuelled debate over the risks of such online content.\n\nBut there was no unanimous agreement that social media harms adolescents, said Jose Cesar Perales, a professor in experimental psychology at the University of Granada.\n\nSanchez said prosecutors would explore ways to investigate possible legal infractions by Grok, as well as by TikTok and Instagram, part of Meta.\n\nThe proposed ban would be implemented as part of a change to an existing bill on digital protection for minors being debated in parliament, a government spokesperson said.\n\nAbout 82% of people in Spain said they believed children under 14 should be banned from social media, according to an Ipsos poll on education published in August last year. That was up from 73% in 2024.",

Reskilling those affected by these job losses could save companies from making redundancy payments totalling as much as £757m, the report found.\n\nUpskilling staff would allow employers to focus on candidates’ potential rather than their past technical experience, the report found. It is estimated that up to 60,000 women in tech leave their roles each year for reasons including lack of advancement, lack of recognition and inadequate pay.\n\nDame Susan Langley, the mayor of City of London, said: “By investing in people and supporting the development of digital skills within the workforce, employers can unlock enormous potential and build stronger, more resilient teams. Focusing on talent, adaptability and opportunity will ensure the UK continues to lead on innovation and remains a global hub for digital excellence.”\n\nRecent surveys have shown that as many as a quarter of UK workers are worried that their jobs could disappear in the next five years because of AI, according to a poll by the international recruitment company Randstad. Union leaders have called on companies to commit to investing in workforce skills and training.\n\nThe City of London Corporation found that women were being overlooked for roles even as difficulties in hiring talent meant more than 12,000 digital vacancies in these sectors went unfilled in 2024.\n\nCompanies have tried to deal with worker shortages by increasing wages above the national average, but the report found that higher pay rates would not solve the problem. It warned that the widening digital talent gap was forecast to last until at least 2035 and that under this scenario the UK could miss out on more than £10bn of economic growth.",

This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues’ privacy.”\n\nIt is unclear whether the engineers, who have not been named, shared the information with colleagues, or with people outside Pinterest.\n\nThe script – a set of commands written to automate a task within existing software or change its function – was aimed at internal tools for workers to communicate, the BBC reported, citing an anonymous source.\n\nThe source, whom the BBC said was “familiar with the firings”, said the code created an alert as to which employee names were being removed or deactivated.\n\nPinterest has been investing heavily in AI to create more personalised content for its users and automated tools for marketers. But shares in the company have dropped by more than 20% this year as investors assess the threat from more advanced AI platforms.\n\nReady said in a company-wide meeting that while “healthy debate and dissent are expected, that’s how we make our decisions”, according to CNBC, which first reported the news.\n\nThe chief executive said Pinterest was facing a “critical moment” and that staff should consider a job elsewhere if they were “working against the direction of the company” and disagreed with its mission, CNBC reported.\n\nIt comes amid a wave of job cuts in the techy sector, as businesses increasingly rely on AI. Last week, Amazon announced it would cut 16,000 roles worldwide, its second round of redundancies in three months.\n\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs division to redirect resources to AI wearables and phone features. Meanwhile, Autodesk, a design software maker, announced plans this month to cut about 1,000 jobs.",

    "fullText": "Duane “Dog the Bounty Hunter” Chapman’s stepson Gregory Zecca is facing life behind bars if convicted of aggravated manslaughter after fatally shooting his teenage son.\n\nFlorida’s Collier County Sheriff’s Office posted an update on the July 2025 incident via Facebook on Tuesday, February 3, stating that Zecca accidentally shot his child, Anthony, 13, in the family’s Naples, Florida, apartment while allegedly under the influence of alcohol. Local Southwest Florida news outlet WINK News was first to report on the update.\n\nPer the Sheriff’s Office, Zecca, 39, was taken into custody “on a warrant for aggravated manslaughter of a child with a firearm and using a firearm while under the influence,” which could result in a life sentence.\n\nA Collier County police investigation into Zecca, who is the son of Dog’s wife, Francie Chapman, from a previous marriage, found that Zecca allegedly “consumed alcohol over several hours at a local establishment, purchased more alcohol, and later used both alcohol and marijuana at a friend's residence.”\n\nChase Chrisley Breaks Down His Drinking Habits and Battery Arrest: ‘Hit Rock Bottom’\n\nZecca and his son were “watching a UFC fight on TV at the time.”\n\nLaw enforcement also reported that Zecca “repeatedly handled a firearm in his son's presence, practicing drawing it from his waistband and dry-firing.” The firearm had “initially been made safe by removing the magazine and clearing a live round from the chamber.”\n\nFurther detail stated that the magazine was put back into the firearm before Zecca “discharged a single shot” that struck Anthony.\n\nSheriff Kevin Rambosk stated in the update that the event “was a heartbreaking and preventable tragedy.”\n\nFormer UFC Champion Cain Velasquez Sentenced to Prison in Attempted Murder Case\n\nRambosk added, “Our detectives conducted an exhaustive and thorough investigation, examining every element of what happened through witness statements, forensic testing, subpoenas, search warrants, and more.”\n\nPolice officials also noted that deputies who arrived at the scene “detected the odor of alcohol on Zecca and observed marijuana in plain view.”\n\nA subsequent toxicology report estimated Zecca's “blood-alcohol concentration to be approximately 0.116 at the time of the shooting, above Florida's legal limit of 0.08.”\n\nZecca was placed on a psychiatric hold following the shooting. A family representative told TMZ one day after the incident occurred that Zecca was “under observation on a 5150 hold,” which meant that he had been involuntarily detained for 72 hours after being deemed “a danger to themselves, to others, or gravely disabled,” per Clear Behavior Health.\n\nBachelorette’s DeAnna Pappas Celebrates Son’s 9th Birthday After Arrest, Incident With Ex\n\nThe rep also told the outlet at the time that the hold was instigated because Zecca was “overcome with grief” and not because he felt guilty of a crime.\n\nDog released a statement via the outlet in the shooting’s aftermath. “We are grieving as a family over this incomprehensible tragic accident and would ask for continued prayers as we grieve the loss of our beloved grandson, Anthony,” Dog and Francie both wrote at the time.\n\nZecca also disabled his Instagram account after the incident. Prior to the account’s disappearance, Zecca had posted photos of himself with Anthony, including one image that showed the pair at a shooting range.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

Musk, who is Tesla and SpaceX's CEO, launched a lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman in February 2024, accusing Altman of jeopardizing its nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said that he contributed $38 million to OpenAI, thinking it would remain a nonprofit. He was one of the company's founders, along with Altman, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and others.\n\nDespite OpenAI's attorneys' attempts to have the case thrown out, a California judge said in a January hearing that there was enough evidence to go to trial, which is set for April.\n\nThe billionaire duo have been trading barbs on social media. Musk attacked OpenAI's ChatGPT on January 20, writing \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT.\" He was responding to an X post alleging that the chatbot has been linked to multiple deaths since 2022.\n\nAltman responded to Musk's post, slamming Tesla's Autopilot system as unsafe, and questioning xAI's Grok chatbot. Grok has faced criticism from governments in several countries after reports of Grok users uploading pictures of women and minors and asking the chatbot to undress them.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Judson Althoff was promoted to this new CEO role in October. He's shuffling several executives who work for him.",
    "fullText": "Judson Althoff, a veteran Microsoft executive recently promoted to commercial CEO, is making changes to the top ranks of his team, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHe elevated Deb Cupp to executive vice president and chief revenue officer of global enterprise sales, according to the memo. Cupp's previous title was president and chief revenue officer of enterprise, according to an internal organizational chart from when Althoff was promoted in October.\n\nAlthoff's promotion was intended to give CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft's engineering leaders more time to focus on AI, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, which described the moment as \"a tectonic AI platform shift.\"\n\nCupp has been at Microsoft for more than eight years and is known for helping the company tailor cloud services for specific industries. In this new role, Cupp will help handle the company's most strategic customer accounts and executive relationships.\n\n\"Judson expanded the remits of his leadership team to free up more time to focus on Microsoft's commercial product strategy and to keep the feedback loop between customers and product decisions as small as possible,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. \"This feedback loop is critical right now because AI is being adopted at extraordinary speed, and our customers expect these capabilities to come to life in their business faster than ever before.\"\n\nAccording to the memo, Althoff made other changes, including:\n\nCommercial business update and leadership announcement\n\nWe have all been rapidly changing how we work as an AI-first company, and we are evolving how we operate to reflect the same. We must become faster, flatter, and more agile in our operating rhythms, empowering our people with the authority to make decisions and removing the friction for them to do so.\n\nOur commercial cohort operating model has illustrated how effective we can be as a company. The cohort forums are intellectually honest sessions aimed at tightening the feedback loop between the voice of the customer and our product ethos. This approach brings engineering, marketing, sales, services, and operations together across the topics that matter most for our business, ensuring that our product ambitions accrue to our customers' needs in this era of Frontier Transformation. In the runup to Ignite, we collaborated through this process to formulate our Intelligence + Trust strategy and pave the way forward for Copilot, our IQ and developer platforms, and Agent 365.\n\nWith this new commercial model established, I will be asking more of our MCAPS leadership to run the business in service of our customers and partners. In recognition of their increased scope and responsibility, I am pleased to share the following role changes to Executive Vice President, which will continue reporting directly to me:\n\nDeb Cupp is our EVP & Chief Revenue Officer, Global Enterprise. She will continue leading our global enterprise sales organization.\n\nMala Anand is our EVP & Chief Customer Experience Officer, bringing together our full spectrum of services including Industry Solutions Delivery, Customer Success, and Support—across Customer Experience & Success.\n\nNick Parker is our EVP & Chief Business Officer of Worldwide Sales & Solutions (WSS). His team leads Commercial Solution Areas, co-engineering, and sales teams including enterprise, industry, partner, and devices.\n\nRalph Haupter is our EVP & Chief Revenue Officer, Small, Medium Enterprises & Channel (SME&C) focused on earning increased share down market through agentic selling and scaling with our Cloud Solution Provider partners.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Deb, Mala, Nick, and Ralph.\n\nKim Akers will continue in her current capacity as our Chief Operating Officer, and Takeshi Numoto remains our Chief Marketing Officer, also reporting directly to me.\n\nI am inspired by how these teams and the cohort operating model are strengthening our core values of customer obsession and One Microsoft. With an increased focus on the commercial business across the company, I look forward to leading our customers, partners, and Microsoft through Frontier Transformation alongside all of you.\n\nJudson\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A Microsoft UX lead details her non-traditional path into AI, starting with studying architecture and highlighting lessons in AI accessibility.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Priyanka Kuvalekar, a 31-year-old UX research lead at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI joined Microsoft in April 2025 as a senior UX researcher. I lead research for Microsoft Teams Calling and related AI experiences.\n\nMy path to this job wasn't typical. I spent five years studying architecture in college, not computer science or AI, and earned my degree in India.\n\nI started my career with a full-time internship as a junior architect while completing the final year of my degree. After I graduated, I began thinking seriously about my next steps. Should I continue as an architect or pivot into the digital world?\n\nI enrolled in a three-month user experience course, which led me to pursue a master's degree in user experience and interaction design.\n\nI moved to Philadelphia and began my master's program in January 2018. My first industry step was an internship as a UX researcher at Korn Ferry. After a year of interning, I was offered a full-time role, which I held until 2021.\n\nI broke into Big Tech at Cisco in October 2021 and worked as a UX research lead for over 3 1/2 years before taking my current position at Microsoft.\n\nI led projects focused on AI features for Webex meetings and messaging as the lead researcher.\n\nI knew I needed to understand AI's mechanics, so I pursued certifications and training, both through my employer and independently, on generative AI, agentic AI design patterns, large language models, and evaluating AI experiences as a researcher.\n\nI also explored courses and online resources on UI design from platforms such as Google Skills, Microsoft Training, and DeepLearning.AI to understand how generative AI could be applied to my projects.\n\nHere are the three biggest lessons I learned that helped me break into AI with a non-tech background.\n\nI learned that you need to understand how to evaluate AI in practice. AI isn't something you test once, and then it's \"done.\" It requires ongoing evaluation to ensure it continues to deliver trustworthy experiences.\n\nThis meant designing qualitative studies that examined how AI conversations hold up across diverse user groups. Inconsistencies in tone, misinterpretations of meaning, and pacing issues were revealed in this research.\n\nAnother key lesson came from approaching AI through an accessibility lens. AI can make tasks easier and reduce barriers for people with disabilities — for example, by automating steps. It can also create new inequities if not designed with accessibility in mind.\n\nAccessibility and AI can't be separated. I've learned to include people with disabilities in AI research and to evaluate how AI integrates with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation.\n\nBreaking into AI also taught me that you don't have to build the technology yourself to make an impact, but you do need to understand it well enough to engage with it.\n\nIt's about learning just enough to bridge the gap between technical teams and user needs, and to ensure that how you gauge AI quality is rooted in real user experience.\n\nGaining fluency meant understanding the concepts behind how large language models work, their limitations, and how to design evaluation frameworks that account for those limits.\n\nThis has helped me ask engineers the right questions and design studies that measure trust, reliability, and consistency across different user groups. It's also helped me work closely with product managers to define what success looks like for AI experiences.\n\nI recommend starting where AI meets people, not where AI meets code — focus on how AI shows up in products and how people experience it.\n\nOne of the most practical ways to add value without a traditional background is by shaping what \"quality\" means for an AI feature. Work with product managers to ask questions like, Does the AI stay within scope? Does it handle interruptions gracefully? Is it inclusive across languages and dialects?\n\nThese things often get overlooked when you view AI only as a technical system, but they're crucial to user trust. If you can frame them in actionable terms, you can become indispensable.\n\nHiring managers don't just want to see that you know AI exists — they want to see how you can shape it responsibly and make it usable.\n\nDocument all frameworks, rubrics, evaluation studies, and examples of how your insights influenced decisions. Even if you don't have access to big-company projects, you can run your own small-scale studies on publicly available AI tools and use those to showcase your thinking.\n\nTry volunteering for projects where AI is being integrated into existing tools, and answer questions like, What does this AI feature need to do? How should it behave? Can the AI explain what it can or can't do? Does it recover gracefully when it makes a mistake?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions researchers, product thinkers, and others with non-traditional backgrounds are uniquely positioned to answer.",

    "fullText": "Google has been on a monumental tear as of late. Can it keep the good times rolling?\n\nWhen Alphabet reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, investors will focus on AI spending, cloud wins, and a big Apple deal.\n\nWith Meta projecting its capex for this year to nearly double that of 2025, how high will Google go? The company said in October that it expected capex for 2025 to land between $91 and $93 billion. Investors will track if it sticks to those goals. Google's finance chief, Anat Ashkenazi, also said the company expected a \"significant\" increase in that number for 2026 and promised we'd hear more on Google's Q4 call this week.\n\nAs my colleague Joe Ciolli has observed this earnings season, investors are more willing to forgive big capital spending on AI as long as fundamentals remain chugging along.\n\nThat leads to the question of how Google's search advertising business, its core engine, is doing. Are OpenAI and other AI rivals chipping away at its dominance, or is Alphabet's money-printing machine whirring as proudly as ever?\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein appeared optimistic in a note this week, writing that they expect Google to have seen an increase in query volume in Q4.\n\n\"For Tinuiti's advertisers, Google's US paid click growth was the highest it has been since early 2021,\" Bernstein analysts wrote, referring to the US marketing agency.\n\nGoogle's cloud business has also become top billing, as it furiously competes with Amazon and Microsoft to build infrastructure and win crucial AI deals. In Q3, Google said the number of new cloud customers increased by about 34% year over year.\n\nBernstein analysts predicted big business for cloud off the back of AI sales, its big Anthropic deal, and the ramp-up of its AI chip business, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\n\"We also note that the new deal between Anthropic and Google for 'tens of billions of dollars' worth of compute represents upside to Google Cloud growth, regardless of whether the money flows through Cloud deals or outright TPU sales,\" they wrote.\n\nSpeaking of deals, this marks the first earnings report since Google and Apple announced that the iPhone giant will use Google's Gemini AI models for its revamped Siri assistant.\n\nThere are still a lot of unanswered questions there. How much does Google get out of the deal? Can Google use query data to train Gemini? Will Apple use Google's data centers and TPU chips?\n\nHopefully, we'll get a clearer picture of the inner workings of that deal on Wednesday's earnings call.",

    "fullText": "Nvidia employees may soon notice less traffic in their inboxes.\n\nThe chip giant has implemented a change to its internal email strategy known as T5Ts, or \"Top 5 Things.\"\n\nT5Ts are regular emails that Nvidia employees are expected to send, outlining what they're working on or thinking about, or where they're running into challenges. The messages are sent across teams and to Nvidia's executive staff — including CEO Jensen Huang, who is often known to respond.\n\nIn January, Nvidia substantially reduced T5T distribution within its vast Worldwide Field Operations organization, the team responsible for selling Nvidia's AI technology and helping customers deploy it in the field.\n\nWWFO employees previously shared their T5T emails broadly across the organization. The new policy limits distribution to a \"much smaller group,\" according to internal communications seen by Business Insider.\n\nThis group includes Huang, members of Nvidia's executive staff, and other senior leaders. Nvidia also directed employees to copy the managers responsible for their customer accounts and the industries in which those customers operate. It could not be learned if the change in T5T distribution is companywide.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nT5Ts have been core to Nvidia's culture for decades, designed to flatten its organizational hierarchy and give leadership visibility into day-to-day operations, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing Tae Kim's book \"The Nvidia Way.\"\n\nThe move comes as Nvidia's workforce has expanded rapidly during the AI boom and as more attention has focused on the company and its operations.\n\nWhile top executives will continue to receive T5Ts, the narrowed distribution could signal a shift from Nvidia's culture of open communication and public feedback. The change could also limit how easily employees spot overlapping issues across teams.\n\nBusiness Insider has previously reported how T5Ts enable leaders to intervene when issues arise. Top executives like Huang and vice president Ian Buck have stepped in to mobilize responses amid customer complaints about product launches and AI deployment hurdles.\n\nHuang, known for his demanding pace and for favoring concise communication, has implemented other strategies to reduce hierarchy at Nvidia.\n\nHuang maintains a large number of direct reports, Business Insider previously reported. He also eschews one-on-one meetings to aid in the flow of information and prefers to work in conference rooms rather than private offices, The Journal reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair was the latest in a long line of hits absorbed by bitcoin in recent months.",
    "fullText": "It's entirely possible you missed the recent meltdown in bitcoin. Not to project, but there were other sell-offs in the likes of gold and silver sucking up most of the oxygen and attention. First Trade flicked at the losses, but it's time to give what's happened its full due.\n\nThe most recent damage absorbed by bitcoin came after the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the Federal Reserve's new chair. Warsh is viewed as a hawk — especially when it comes to the size of the central bank's balance sheet — and hawkishness is bad for risk assets like crypto.\n\nThe Warsh development explains the latest leg down, which pushed the price of bitcoin to its lowest level since Trump's election victory in November 2024.\n\nBut that's just the last 10% or so, in the last few days. What about the nearly-30% plunge in the several months before that?\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, investors rotated out of riskier assets like tech stocks and crypto. This coincided with the Fed taking a more conservative tone around future rate cuts, after having already eased multiple times in 2025.\n\nBut as stocks have since recovered to a series of fresh records, bitcoin has continued to flounder. Blame crypto-specific headwinds like delays in the passage of key crypto-regulation measures.\n\nAnd then there are the bitcoin-treasury firms, most notably Strategy, which have positioned their businesses around amassing as much of the crypto as possible. As the price of bitcoin has tumbled, so has speculation that these big institutions could be forced to sell in size.\n\nThe level to watch is $76,000. That's the average that Strategy has paid for its tokens. If the price of bitcoin has fallen below it, that means the firm is sitting on paper losses. The mere prospect of that has investors on edge.\n\nThe commentary surrounding the latest bitcoin sell-off has been less than encouraging. John Blank, the chief strategist at Zacks Investment Research, says the token could sink all the way to $40,000 — about 45% below current levels. He also laid out three reasons why the ongoing crypto winter could last for months longer.\n\nEven famed \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry got in on the action. He didn't explicitly call for further losses in bitcoin, instead focusing on a trio of \"sickening\" scenarios that could play out if the crypto keeps falling.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, bitcoin is in a tough spot right now. What happens with Strategy, and how far below their market net asset value it can trade, will be top of mind for investors.\n\nIn the meantime, the crypto market is only enticing for traders looking to bottom-fish. Fortune does tend to favor the bold, but you'd have to have serious guts to buy in right now.",

    "description": "BofA analysts predict this tax season will bring fresh stimulus to the economy. It could also boost these eight stock in the retail sector.",
    "fullText": "Tax season approaches, and with the promise of refunds hitting Americans' bank accounts comes potential positive impacts for the stock market.\n\nBank of America analysts think that coming tax refunds will provide fresh stimulus for the US economy in the form of both bigger refunds and smaller tax bills. The bank's analysts estimate that the total boost to GDP could amount to as much as $140 billion.\n\nSome of the value could come from the state and local tax (SALT) cap, no tax on overtime or tips, and an increased standard deduction for seniors. BofA's US Economics team estimates that these policies will boost returns by 26%, adding $1,000 per family on average.\n\nBut that's not the only positive force the bank is eyeing. According to BofA's Robert Ohmes, two areas of the stock market's wider retail sector are poised to win amid this year's lighter tax burden for US consumers.\n\nHe breaks down the categories into value and broadline stocks. Here are the winners he sees in each category.\n\nOhmes thinks value retail names will get a boost as lower and middle-income tax filers are likely to spend refund cash on consumer staples and paying down debt.\n\n\"Tax refunds in the lowest (sub $3K) refund buckets appear to support growth in discretionary purchases (general merchandise) along with growth in spending on Groceries & Gas,\" the analyst said.\n\nBroadline retail is a category that the bank associates with higher-income households. Ohmes said Costco and Walmart will benefit as high earners gravitate toward these stores and as the companies double down on same-day delivery and e-commerce ventures.\n\n\"As a result, we believe WMT & COST could see greater benefits from tax refunds in 2026 vs. LY as well as potentially higher exposure to middle- and higher-income filers who benefit from higher standard deductions for seniors and the higher state and local tax (SALT) cap,\" he noted.\n\nThe analyst added that he also expects broadline retailers to benefit from an increase in spending on consumer electronics, which could benefit other retail names like Best Buy.\n\nMany retailers saw solid gains in Tuesday's session amid a pronounced rotation out of tech stocks. Walmart jumped 3% to hit a $1 trillion valuation.",

His identity and employment has been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a senior software engineer at Google in Zurich, where I've worked since 2013.\n\nMost people don't go from business to a more technical background, but my bachelor's degree was in business studies, and I joined Google out of undergrad as a financial analyst intern.\n\nOver several years, I pivoted from financial analysis to business analysis, then to trust and safety, and onto an engineering team in 2016. I joined several other software engineering teams, and then eventually joined Google Cloud AI, where I worked on one of the cloud AI products for a few years.\n\nThen I joined an internal LLM innovation team within Google's core infrastructure group, which we later turned into an LLM information retrieval applied research team, where I am today, leading the team.\n\nTo make multiple shifts like this, you need to upskill and explore other areas. Here's how I did it:\n\nAs soon as I joined Google, I decided my North Star was to become a data scientist. Initially, I had a lot of success broadening my skillset with online courses like Coursera, edX, or Stanford. I used them to explore finance, then statistics, then spent most of my time in the computer science and data science space.\n\nAll in all, I completed roughly 40 online open courses, most of them through Coursera.\n\nSome of the courses I took include:\n\nThe courses were spread out from 2013 to 2021, and I took them on evenings and weekends. I didn't have much time for video games, but I still made time to go to the gym, eat, sleep, and spend time with my girlfriend.\n\nI wasn't super structured in my approach to taking courses. I didn't say \"I must do five hours a day,\" or anything like that. I took them as I felt the need to do one or to learn more about a particular topic. I didn't burn out from it.\n\nThe most measurably impactful courses I completed were the first two Coursera courses: Data Analysis and Computing for Data Analysis. I did them right before I interviewed for my internship at Google and the interviewer happened to have done the same course, so we had this instant rapport.\n\nI also did more formal part-time study.\n\nI finished my Bachelor of Business Studies in 2013. Then at Google, I got a part-time postgraduate certificate in statistics, which took a year. Then I did a part-time master's degree in Business Analytics, which took two years. Then I pursued a part-time master's degree in software engineering, which took close to five years. Most recently, I did a diploma in Advanced Studies In Data Science, which took another two years.\n\nI did a bunch of summer school certificates, which is when you spend a week doing PhD-level courses.\n\nMy message to others who want to transition is don't be discouraged. When I first wanted to join Google, several hiring managers weren't interested because I didn't have a computer science undergraduate degree. Similarly, when I applied for a Master's in Business Analytics, I was initially declined because I didn't have a technical undergraduate degree and two semesters of programming experience, even though I was programming at Google. There were hurdles that I had to work around.\n\nI always wanted to study computer science, but my dad told me it's better to learn something different because I'll probably end up in it anyway. In hindsight, he was right.\n\nStudying computer science would have certainly expedited my career track, but I'm in a place where it's no longer a hindrance, and I'm familiar with a bunch of business theories, like Porter's Five Forces. They're not always useful, but every once in a while, it comes up in conversation.\n\nThe constant here is that my background includes continuous learning. When recruiters or hiring managers see my profile, they see that I'm not someone who gets complacent.\n\nDid you make a career pivot? We want to hear from you.

    "description": "Although consumers are drinking less, the industry is seeing a rise in \"daycap\" drinking, as younger consumers shift away from late-night consumption.",
    "fullText": "Vodka has long been associated with late nights and crowded clubs, but Absolut is betting its next growth moment will happen earlier in the day.\n\nThe spirits giant recently partnered with Tabasco to launch a spicy vodka designed with brunch cocktails in mind — a move that reflects a broader shift in how and when Americans are drinking.\n\nAs overall alcohol consumption declines, especially among younger generations, brands are increasingly chasing what some are calling the \"daycap\"— intentional daytime drinking tied to social occasions like brunch rather than nightlife. Data from Bacardi ties the daycap trend to what it calls \"snackable sips\" and \"mini martinis,\" influenced by European consumption habits, rather than nights out drinking to excess.\n\n\"People are not just staying at home, they are going out, they're going to brunch, they're choosing different times of the day to drink,\" Caroline Begley, US VP of Marketing for Absolut, told Business Insider.\n\nAbsolut's Tabasco-infused vodka leans hard into meeting that moment for early drinkers. The brand has positioned the product around Bloody Marys and other brunch-friendly cocktails, timing its rollout to coincide with Bloody Mary Day, National Hot Sauce Day, and the lead-up to the Super Bowl — all daytime drinking occasions.\n\nAbsolut even marked the launch with a brunch event in New York City, a deliberate nod to the mid-morning communal dining trend that many brands see as resurgent.\n\nThe strategy comes as younger consumers are rethinking their relationship with alcohol. Gen Z and millennials are drinking somewhat less overall than prior generations, but when they do drink, they tend to be more intentional about the occasion, the setting, and the flavor.\n\nIpsos found in 2025 a year-over-year increase in daytime drinking across generations, a trend marketers increasingly point to as evidence that alcohol consumption is shifting earlier rather than disappearing entirely.\n\nBrunch has become a particularly attractive target. OpenTable data shows an increase in large-group reservations, with mid-morning emerging as a popular time for social dining. Yelp has reported a 142% rise in searches for breakfast and brunch over the past year, while Datassential research, cited by Absolut, suggests that more than half of alcohol-drinking consumers attend brunch monthly — including a large majority of Gen Z.\n\nFlavor experimentation has also become a key lever for reaching those drinkers. Spicy foods and beverages, in particular, have gained traction with younger consumers — a trend acknowledged by executives across the restaurant sector, including a recent reference from McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski as a top flavor to watch in 2026.\n\nMarket research firms project growth in both the hot sauce category and spicy spirits in the coming years, making heat an increasingly popular way for legacy brands to stand out.\n\nFor Absolut, the Tabasco partnership is as much about reframing vodka as it is about launching a new product. Begley said Absolut sees vodka as at risk of feeling \"one-dimensional\" at a time when consumers want more from fewer drinks. A brunch-focused, flavor-forward product allows Absolut to stay relevant without relying on the late-night drinking culture that younger consumers are increasingly opting out of.\n\nThe return of high-energy brunches — from restaurant expansions to revived daytime programming at nightlife-adjacent venues — suggests the shift may have staying power.\n\nFor spirits brands, that means the future of drinking may not be about convincing people to drink more, but about meeting them where they already are: cocktail in hand, well before sunset.",

    "description": "A Gen Xer and her husband sold their house to live and work in an RV. They've been doing that for over six years and hope to continue.",
    "fullText": "In Anne and Brian Klumpp's 45-foot motorhome is a US map titled \"on the road of adventure.\"\n\nSome of the states are filled in with photos of them or their RV, which they've called home for over six-and-a-half years. The blank states will hopefully get their own photos one day, as Anne and her husband aim to see each one by RV.\n\nMichigan has a photo of their 35-foot boat, which was their \"floating summer cottage,\" that they've since sold. The couple also sold their house and then hit the road in 2019. Brian works a full-time gig during the week, Anne has various income streams, and the couple travels to their next spot on some weekends so that they are ready to go for the workweek.\n\nAnne finds traveling in an RV the most luxurious way to see the country because you have your own bed, don't have to try to fit everything you need into a suitcase, and don't have to figure out accommodations.\n\n\"You essentially have all of your stuff with you, and you get to have a nice, easy morning drinking coffee out of your favorite coffee mug sitting on your own couch with the dog curled up beside you,\" said Anne, who has a nearly eight-year-old Australian labradoodle named Skipper.\n\nAnne's husband dreamed of living on a boat full time, so they set a five-year goal for that. However, they pivoted to a new plan because Anne confessed she didn't have the same dream.\n\nHer husband proposed the RV lifestyle instead. Anne told Brian that when they started dating, she didn't like camping, so she never expected to spend six years and counting visiting campgrounds.\n\nThe two kick-started their RV lifestyle when Anne's sales job in the wine industry shifted to more travel. She said the increase wouldn't be feasible from a motorhome. Plus, it would mean traveling for work instead of for fun. So the couple got their home ready to sell for their new adventure.\n\nThey bought a 45-foot motorhome for $211,000 in February 2019. They put their home up for sale in March, which sold shortly after in April for $367,000. They also sold their boat and dinghy for $103,000. Anne left her 15-year career at Vineyard Brands, and the couple hit the road and have been traveling since.\n\n\"We have seating for eight for cocktails, dinner for four, and then we just sleep two people, so it's a really nice setup,\" Anne said.\n\nIn addition to their motorhome, they tow a pickup truck so that they can use a smaller vehicle to run errands and do other activities. Anne said it's also kind of like a garage because they store their bikes and other items underneath a truck topper.\n\nAnne said the value of their $211,000 motorhome, which they paid off from the start, is probably about $170,000.\n\n\"You're definitely talking about a depreciating asset as opposed to a house, which would be an appreciating asset,\" she said. \"We do our appreciation in the form of going and seeing things that help us to appreciate life more.\"\n\nAnne said they prefer to stay and pay for spots at RV parks and resorts that offer electric, sewer, and water hookups rather than free parking areas. The couple usually budgets $1,200 to $1,500 for monthly rent, including those expenses.\n\n\"It just makes life simpler when we don't have to think about if we're going to have enough power, what's going to happen if our solar doesn't charge, how are we going to manage water and waste removal,\" Anne said.\n\nThe couple relies on the internet to maintain their jobs. Anne said they have several internet providers and \"pay a ridiculous amount of money in internet fees to make sure that we are well-connected.\" She believes her entertainment budget is larger than it would be at a house, and they budget a lot for repairs and maintenance since they move around a lot.\n\nIn 2024, she said they spent over $2,500 on diesel for the motorhome and about $2,000 for their pickup truck's gas, nearly $24,000 on meals and entertainment, and over $5,000 on phone and internet.\n\nAfter years on the road, the couple is looking to have a home base, at least for the winter season. Anne said they bought a site in Fredericksburg, Texas. She said it allows them to take a break from the wear and tear of traveling because even though it's fun, it can be mentally taxing.\n\n\"The quarter-acre lot we purchased is being developed as an RV lot with a large pad, covered outdoor kitchen and patio, and firepit area,\" Anne said. \"We are currently living on it and will rent it out when we are not here.\"\n\nThe couple works different jobs with different levels of flexibility: Anne is a content creator, working with brands. She also writes articles and sells advertisements for RV Destinations Magazine. Brian works for solid-state computer hard drive manufacturer Solidigm as head of governance, risk, and compliance.\n\n\"I didn't have to tell my company about our lifestyle but I chose not to hide it,\" Brian said. \"Most of my coworkers think it's pretty cool and occasionally ask questions about it. They often ask where we are parked.\"\n\nTheir prior experience working from home made the transition to remote work in a smaller space smooth. They use noise-canceling headphones to focus, and Anne's desk is mobile, so she can move around if they need more space. Anne's work isn't full time; sometimes she works 20 hours a week, but can get up to 60 hours. Brian tends to work at his desk for 40 to 60 hours a week.\n\n\"I do a lot of the management of our lifestyle,\" Anne said, including figuring out where to run errands, taking their dog to appointments and walks, and the logistics of getting mail and packages. On Wednesday nights, they like to explore, such as dining at local restaurants.\n\nOn the weekends, they also like to explore where they're at, hike, visit national monuments if they're nearby, and find a local church to attend. The weekend is also their travel time. Anne said they tend to hit the road every two to four weeks on Saturdays because they want to make sure they have steady internet for work and do not have to worry about traveling during the week.\n\n\"I am willing to drive, but my husband does most of it, but it's physically and mentally very taxing, much more so than just jumping in your car to go drive for a couple of hours,\" she said.\n\nAnne enjoys watching the scenery as they travel to their next destination.\n\n\"You have this massive windshield that's essentially like your Imax screen that's right there,\" she said. \"It's so incredible to look out the window, and it doesn't matter if you're in the desert or you're up in northern Michigan with all the pine trees and maples. It's just magical.\"\n\nAnne said the couple is slowing down their travels at least for a bit. She's hoping to redecorate during that time because \"when you only have one weekend in between moves, you just don't really want to spend that painting on wallpapering.\"",

    "title": "Why so many companies are rethinking performance reviews",
    "description": "Some big-name companies are remaking performance reviews to prize top performers, focus on workers' contributions, and prioritize continuous feedback.",
    "fullText": "The next report card you get at work might carry higher stakes.\n\nBig-name companies, including Meta, Amazon, and Boston Consulting Group, are adjusting how they evaluate people. The reasons vary, from prioritizing AI use to incentivizing top performers with bigger pay.\n\nAs AI drives what feels like ever-faster change, and as many workers stay in their jobs for longer, employers are recognizing a need to make their performance evaluations more responsive, workplace observers told Business Insider.\n\nOne such company is staffing firm Adecco Group, which is revamping its review process for its more than 35,000 corporate workers across 60-plus countries. The changes include ensuring that workers don't have too many goals — generally two to five — and that it's clear how they can meet them.\n\n\"We have this combination of what we want to achieve, but also how we achieve it,\" Daniela Seabrook, Adecco Group's CHRO, told Business Insider. \"The behavioral aspect is really important for us.\"\n\nShe said that driving the change is the company's intent to have \"a continuous exchange between an employee and a leader\" — not just a formal review once or twice a year. More frequent feedback is necessary, Seabrook, to keep up with the pace of change in business.\n\n\"It's very important that the people know, 'Where am I? How am I doing? How am I developing?'\" she said.\n\nIn a fast-changing environment, questions of how workers are performing often center on their agility and adaptability, said Allison Vaillancourt, a VP at the HR consulting firm Segal.\n\nIn other cases, employers benefiting from the tight labor market simply want to squeeze more productivity out of their workers and think they can get there by grading harder, she said.\n\nThat means getting to say, \"I'm going to really ramp up my performance evaluation process, so I'm only keeping my best people,\" Vaillancourt said.\n\nThat might sound scary, yet few people loved the old way of doing reviews, which often involved cranking out a self-evaluation, then sitting down with your boss. The process tended to leave even managers feeling nervous, she said, making for a meeting that was awkward at best.\n\nEven HR isn't sold on them. Only 2% of CHROs from Fortune 500 companies that Gallup surveyed in 2023 strongly agreed that their performance process motivated workers to improve.\n\nOne idea that's not new but is getting renewed attention is giving feedback more often, as Adecco Group is doing.\n\nThere's a recognition, Vaillancourt said, that many of the most effective organizations are those where managers regularly coach their teams.\n\nAlready, 65% of organizations use a \"continuous performance design\" that focuses on regular, systematic feedback alongside an annual review, according to a 2025 assessment by the research firm Gartner.\n\nIt makes sense, Vaillancourt said, that bosses would set goals at the start of the year yet continue to tweak them as needed.\n\nNot all adjustments relate to how often bosses give feedback. Business Insider previously reported that Meta is simplifying its evaluation process to better reward top performers, and Amazon is adjusting its reviews to focus more on individual accomplishments.\n\nBCG expects workers to use AI as part of their jobs, so the technology shapes how the firm evaluates workers' abilities, such as problem-solving. The firm has incorporated expectations around AI into the benchmarks it uses to evaluate consultants, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nAs part of its overhaul, Adecco Group is adding development goals to guide workers' growth. Those are aspirational, Seabrook said, which is why workers aren't measured on them as part of the performance-review process.\n\nThe distinction between assessment and development is important, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews. Too often, he said, the focus shifts to helping workers grow rather than evaluating their performance.\n\n\"You might be able to get development out of the continuous feedback conversations, but you lose the assessment side,\" he said.\n\nThose appraisals matter, Murray said, because they inform key decisions about things like pay and who gets promoted. If there aren't formal ways to document performance, bosses might turn to \"shadow ratings.\" That could be something as simple as using a spreadsheet to track who's performing well and who isn't, he said.\n\nAnother reason that performance reviews are changing is that some employees' expectations are shifting, said Rajesh Namboothiry, senior vice president at the staffing firm ManpowerGroup. Even when the job market isn't great, workers still tend to prioritize flexibility, job satisfaction, and clarity about career growth, he said.\n\nAnnual reviews often fail to meet those needs and can contribute to burnout rather than engagement, Namboothiry said.\n\nAs the job market for desk workers has softened — and workers stay put longer — savvy employers know that they need to keep employees engaged because those workers will be key to helping companies transform, Namboothiry said.\n\nCompanies that excel at retention, he said, focus on career development and employee satisfaction.\n\n\"They understand that lack of growth opportunity is a key driver for attrition,\" Namboothiry said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "description": "Four women have taken the stand to accuse the wealthy Alexander brothers of rape. Here are their stories —and what defense lawyers say in response.",
    "fullText": "The Alexander brothers' sex-trafficking trial is in its second week, and each sibling has now watched from the defense table as a woman told the jury that he raped her.\n\nIn sometimes tearful testimony, these accusers described being drugged, overpowered, or filmed while barely conscious. None reported their alleged assaults to police. The trial is expected to last a month.\n\nTal Alexander, 39, was a real-estate broker who, along with his brother Oren Alexander, 38, sold multimillion-dollar properties in Miami and Manhattan to wealthy and influential clients. The third brother, Alon Alexander — Oren's twin — is a former executive at their parents' private security firm.\n\nAll three brothers are being held without bail and face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nHere are the women's accounts and the defense case presented so far.\n\nThe first rape accuser testified under the pseudonym Katie Moore about an incident in Manhattan in 2012, when she was a 20-year-old marketing intern. Moore described a night of partying with a small group that included her friend Ainsley, Tal Alexander, Alon Alexander, and the brothers' then-friend, actor Zac Efron.\n\nMoore told the jury she collapsed at a nightclub after one sip from a drink handed to her by one of Tal's friends.\n\nWhen she came to, she said, she was naked on a bed in the two brothers' shared Manhattan apartment. \"I don't want to have sex with you,\" she said she told Alon, who was standing at the side of the bed, also naked.\n\n\"But you already did,\" she testified he told her, laughing, before raping her again.\n\nJurors saw text exchanges in which Moore told her boyfriend of the alleged rape, and heard from two friends who said she told them, too. \"My advice was that it would be ineffective to go to the police,\" given that the Alexanders were \"powerful people,\" testified one friend, now a lawyer in Massachusetts.\n\nThe defense is arguing that photos from the evening show Moore drinking and having fun — including one taken by Efron that she uploaded to Facebook the next morning. The defense suggests that Moore had consensual sex with Alon and repeatedly lied to hide it from her boyfriend.\n\nThe second rape accuser testified under the pseudonym Maya Miller about an incident at a luxurious beachfront Hamptons rental in 2016, when she was a 24-year-old aspiring model about to enter nursing school.\n\nMiller testified that she spent the second evening at the house rebuffing Tal's advances and guarding herself and her friend Alicia, who had lost consciousness after half a glass of wine. (Miller said she herself had poured any drink that was handed to her down the sink when no one was looking).\n\n\"This is how you thank me for inviting you to a beautiful home?\" Miller said Tal angrily asked her the next morning, chasing her into the bedroom's shower, where she said he grabbed her by the neck and raped her. \"You wanted that,\" she said he told her afterward.\n\nJurors heard from two friends who described Miller tearfully telling them about the alleged attack. Jurors also saw an email from Tal to Alon reading, \"See below these cheap hookers coming to the Hamptons.\"\n\nThe defense questioned why Miller never spoke with Alicia about the incident, and pointed to photos of the two women enjoying high tea at the Plaza Hotel once they returned to Manhattan. They also showed the jury friendly text messages Miller shared with Tal before flying home.\n\nThe third accuser took the stand under the pseudonym Amelia Rosen.\n\nRosen said she was 17 and an aspiring model from Ukraine in 2009, when Oren, then 21, and a second, unnamed man videotaped themselves having sex with her in a Manhattan bedroom.\n\nRosen has no memory of that evening and told the jury she learned of the video when she was contacted by federal prosecutors, who say it shows her naked, stumbling and, at times, unable to move.\n\n\"I can hardly understand what I was saying,\" Rosen said tearfully, when shown a snippet of what prosecutor Andrew Jones has called a \"trophy tape,\" depicting the twin \"stone-cold sober\" as he sets up a tripod.\n\nBoth sides had warned the jury during opening statements that the video may be disturbing, and some jurors appeared visibly upset when they viewed it in court on Thursday.\n\n\"It will be unnerving to you,\" Oren's defense lawyer, Teny Geragos, told the panel's six men and six women. But \"what this video shows is not sex trafficking,\" Geragos added.\n\nThe fourth accuser, a Ukrainian native who testified under the pseudonym Bella Koval, described being drugged and raped in 2016 while guests of the brothers at the same Hamptons rental described by the second accuser.\n\nKoval, then a 23-year-old model, said she and the friend she brought, Alison, met the brothers on the exclusive dating app Raya.\n\nShe told jurors that a few sips from a \"fruity,\" ice-filled drink, handed to her by Oren, left her teetering on her high heels during a poolside party. A glass of water handed to her by Alon, who had helped her into a first-floor bedroom, then left her conscious but unable to move, she testified.\n\n\"He had no expression other than this brooding anger,\" during the rape that evening, Koval testified. \"I was unable to scream,\" she testified.\n\nKoval testified that her friend Alison told her she was \"gang raped\" that night. Koval also told jurors that in the following hours and days, she told an ex-boyfriend and two female friends she'd been drugged and raped.\n\nThe defense challenged Koval's testimony that she was not a heavy drinker and her decision to stay at the Hamptons house a second day. Koval blamed the home's isolation, the Labor Day \"surge pricing\" for car service, and her fear of the brothers' power and influence.",

    "fullText": "Ireland captain Caelan Doris says improving the team's discipline during the Six Nations \"starts with me\" as he admitted he must set a better example for the squad.\n\nAndy Farrell's side's discipline has been a key talking point in the build-up to Thursday night's opener against France in Paris (20:10 GMT) after a chastening loss to South Africa in November which yielded four yellow cards and a red.\n\nAs they bid to reclaim the Six Nations title from France, Doris says discipline has been \"right up there\" in Irish minds during their pre-tournament preparations.\n\n\"It's one of the key points we've talked about since coming into camp especially off the back of November where it wasn't good enough,\" said Doris.\n\n\"I would've had chats with the coaches post-November around me as captain needing to lead it better.\n\n\"I gave away too many penalties in November, so it starts with me and the more senior players.\"\n\nSpeaking after leading Ireland's captain's run at Stade de France, Doris added: \"Across the board it's very important, especially with the way the game's going.\n\n\"There are more cards these days. They're harder on offsides, breakdown and they want to favour the attacking team, so smart decision-making there and being really clinical and disciplined is going to be very important.\n\nInjury-hit Ireland, who lost 42-27 to France in Dublin last year, are underdogs for Thursday's game, like they were in 2024 when they travelled to Marseille and won 38-17.\n\nBut 27-year-old Doris says he is not taking too much inspiration from what happened two years ago.\n\n\"The internal view and perception is that there's still a lot of belief at the core. That's grown over the last 10 days,\" he said.\n\n\"We've created evidence for more confidence and belief based on how we've shown up on the field and also connections built off it and work being done off it as well.\n\n\"There's a pretty positive feeling based on how we've trained and how the lads have shown up and integrated.\"",

    "description": "With excitement rising for this year's Stade de France curtain-raiser against Ireland, BBC Sport NI looks at how France are shaping up for their Six Nations title defence.",
    "fullText": "France are the Six Nations holders. Inspirational captain Antoine Dupont is fit. They possess a beefy pack and backline of phenomenal speed and creativity. Three of their games are at home.\n\nSuch factors help explain why Les Bleus are, for many, clear favourites to defend their title and possibly lay down a marker 18 months out from the World Cup.\n\nBut much like Thursday's opponents Ireland, their preparations for the tournament have been far from serene.\n\nWith the teams named and excitement for this year's Stade de France curtain-raiser rising, BBC Sport NI looks at how France are shaping up for the latest chapter in their enthralling rivalry with Ireland and the tournament as a whole.\n\nIreland start Loughman but Lowe and Furlong out\n\n'No panic' over Ireland's injury list - Sheehan\n\nWhat impact might 'unprecedented' Six Nations schedule have?\n\nHead coach Fabien Galthie has some of the finest rugby players on the planet at his disposal, but much of the spotlight in recent weeks has been fixed on established names who will not be lining out in the French capital on Thursday.\n\nGalthie caused a stir last month when he revealed a 42-man squad without Gregory Alldritt, Gael Fickou and Damian Penaud.\n\nAll three have been big players in the Test arena in recent years.\n\nPenaud's national record haul of 40 tries in 59 caps includes four against Ireland, and while there are question marks over his defensive capabilities, it is hard to reckon with the fact that the insatiable try-scoring appetite that has often lit up the Six Nations is not currently a part of the French armoury.\n\nThe upside for France is that, with Penaud out, Theo Attissogbe starts on the right wing. The jet-heeled 21-year-old has had an injury-hit season with Pau, but he scored three tries in two Six Nations outings last year.\n\nElectrifying left winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey has scored 18 tries in 17 games this season, so even without Penaud's finishing prowess, France will be typically deadly out wide.\n\nFickou's absence robs France of a 98-cap veteran, but Galthie has a wealth of options in midfield. Bordeaux pair Yoram Moefana and Nicolas Depoortere, who start against Ireland, are 25 and 23 respectively, while Toulouse's Kalvin Gourgues is a hugely exciting option to have in reserve.\n\nGiven that Alldritt stepped in as captain for the injured Dupont last year, his absence was particularly striking. Anthony Jelonch profits from Alldritt's absence. He has not started a Six Nations game in three years and has not started at eight for France since the 2023 World Cup.\n\nBeyond the three notable omissions, Galthie is without lock Thibaud Flament, who misses Thursday's game because it clashes with his wife's fertility treatment, and veteran prop Uini Atonio, who was forced to retire with a heart problem.\n\nWith no Atonio, Galthie has turned to Dorian Aldegheri, whose solitary Six Nations start prior to Thursday came against England three years ago.\n\n\"France have an issue at prop, especially at tight-head,\" said French rugby expert Paul Eddison.\n\n\"We obviously had the shocking news about Uini Atonio and it will be interesting to see how they replace him.\n\n\"He was incredibly popular in the squad. Regis Montange started in the autumn, Tevita Tatafu was seen as the next guy coming through but has had serious injury problems. It's an area teams may look to exploit.\"\n\nIreland have a similar issue up front. Loose-heads Andrew Porter, Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle are all missing, while tight-head Tadhg Furlong was not risked for Thursday's opener, paving the way for a new-look front row of Jeremy Loughman, Dan Sheehan and Thomas Clarkson.\n\nWith Romain Ntamack injured, Galthie has selected Matthieu Jalibert at fly-half alongside Dupont, who returns to Test rugby after injuring his knee against Ireland last year.\n\nIt is only the second time they have been paired together from the start since the 2023 World Cup (the other being a 26-25 loss to England last year), although Dupont's Olympic commitments and injury troubles have been obstacles to progressing the partnership.\n\nJalibert has been outstanding for Bordeaux this season but he hasn't always had the easiest relationship with Galthie. In November 2024, he refused a spot on the bench after Thomas Ramos was picked at 10 against New Zealand.\n\nLast year, Jalibert was dropped after France's loss to England and did not feature in the final three Six Nations games, but his performances for the European champions this season have made overlooking him impossible.\n\n\"It's interesting with Jalibert. He's ridiculously talented and on his day is up there with the best attacking players in the world, but he and Galthie haven't always seen eye to eye,\" says Eddison.\n\n\"There's been a question in France about how to get the best out of Dupont and Jalibert together.\n\n\"I think it can work. Dupont has the all-round game, so there shouldn't really be an issue with who he is playing with. It's just important to make sure Jalibert gets plenty of ball in hand.\n\n\"There are people who think Jalibert hasn't quite done it at international level, but this is his time to shine. When he's playing well, he's a joy to watch and that can make France an even more formidable team.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old centre has broken into the Toulouse team this season, scoring eight tries in 14 games. He made his France debut off the bench against Australia in November and is on the bench for the Ireland game. Last year, he underwent surgery for a blood clot issue in his foot but now looks primed for the big stage.\n\n\"He's looked unplayable this season,\" says Eddison.\n\n\"Ball in hand he is lightning fast. He can play 10, 12, 13 or 15. He's going to be amazing.\"\n\nAlso on the bench is the 22-year-old back row who captained France to victory in the 2023 Under-20 World Championship and who already has 68 Montpellier appearances under his belt.\n\n\"Shaun Edwards has recently been speaking about how good he's been. They've been impressed with him and keen to get him involved,\" said Eddison.\n\nAnother star of the 2023 Under-20s, Depoortere has scored 14 tries in 18 games for Bordeaux and France this season. He starts alongside Bordeaux team-mate Yoram Moefana in midfield.\n\n\"A silky runner. He's been scoring tries for fun and has been playing alongside Moefana every week, so I'd expect to see a lot of him,\" said Eddison.\n\n\"This could be the year when everyone realises just how good he is.\"\n\nListen to The Ireland Rugby Social's Six Nations preview\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "description": "Jess Fishlock says she is \"fleshing out the details\" over a potential role with Wales following her retirement from international football.",
    "fullText": "Jess Fishlock says she is \"fleshing out the details\" over a potential role with Wales following her retirement from international football.\n\nWales boss Rhian Wilkinson said in December that she hoped Fishlock, who ended her stellar international career last October, would join her coaching staff for the start of World Cup qualifying in March.\n\nSeattle Reign midfielder Fishlock, 39, says her phone \"blew up\" after Wilkinson's comments – and that she got a telling off from her mother because she found out the news from the media rather than her daughter.\n\n\"My mum saw it and asked, are you working for Rhian? She got me in trouble,\" Fishlock said.\n\nOn whether she has spoken to Wilkinson and what the role might be, Fishlock said: \"I can't say, but we had a brief conversation about me being involved and what it would look like - I just didn't realise it would go public.\n\n\"But we have had conversations, we are on the same page, just fleshing out the details.\"\n\nFishlock is Wales' record appearance maker and goalscorer, having won 166 senior caps and scored 48 times.\n\nShe stepped away from Wales duty in the wake of Euro 2025, the country's first major international women's football tournament, insisting it was \"the right time\" after her farewell appearance in a friendly against Australia.\n\nOn the idea of playing some part for Wales in their 2027 World Cup qualifiers against Czech Republic and Montenegro in March, Fishlock remains coy.\n\n\"I would love to stay involved in some capacity; it wasn't a clean break - I still text the girls all the time. But we will just wait and see,\" Fishlock told BBC Sport.\n\nFishlock played 18 times for Seattle Reign last season and helped them qualify for the end-of-season play-offs in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL).\n\nHer contribution at club level has led some in Wales to suggest she could still play a full part as Wilkinson's team attempt to qualify for the Women's World Cup finals for the first time.\n\nBut though Fishlock says she misses her international team-mates, she has reiterated that the time has come for the next generation to take over.\n\n\"People have said, if you are back you may as well play,\" she says. \"But it is still the right time not to play internationals.\n\n\"I still want to help any way I can, my experience being around might help. But no, no thoughts about coming out of retirement.\"\n\nFishlock also has no regrets about the Euros, despite Wales being outclassed in a group with France, Netherlands and eventual champions England.\n\nWales lost all three games while conceding 13 goals, leaving them with the worst group stage record in the history of the competition.\n\n\"I still look back at it with such pride and joy,\" Fishlock says. \"Getting to represent the entire country, it was even more impactful that I thought it was going to be.\n\n\"Seeing how Wales showed up for us, that was the best part of it all. As a competitor it hurt, but the whole world seeing who we are as a nation overrides it.\n\n\"I still get goosebumps coming out for the first game [versus Netherlands] and seeing the Red Wall - it will stay with me forever.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Around 2,900 athletes from more than 90 countries will compete on the ice and snow at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe world's biggest winter sports stars will descend on northern Italy from Friday 6 February and there's certain to be thrills, drama and breakout performances.\n\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the global stars and stories to look out for.\n\nJust five days before the women's downhill event takes place in Cortina, Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn announced that she had ruptured her left anterior cruciate ligament but is still hopeful that she can compete on Sunday.\n\nVonn was airlifted to hospital in Switzerland after crashing in the final World Cup race of the season but remains determined to compete in her fifth Olympics, despite the serious injury.\n\nThe veteran skier is no stranger to a comeback having retired in 2019 because of injury before undergoing partial replacement knee surgery on her right knee and returning to the sport in 2024.\n\nThe four-time overall World Cup winner is unsure whether she will be able to compete in the super-G and team events but, as a heavy favourite for the downhill gold before suffering the injury, she is determined to make the start gate at what will likely be her last Olympics.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin is the greatest alpine skier of all time and, competing at her fourth Olympics, has said she wants to \"make peace\" with the Games following disappointment in Beijing along with serious injury and mental health struggles.\n\nThe five-time overall World Cup winner has 108 World Cup wins, securing victory in the opening five slalom events of the season which, when added to her victory in the final slalom of last season, equalled her own record of six consecutive wins in the discipline.\n\nBut the two-time Olympic champion will be targeting a return to the podium in Cortina while her fiance Aleksander Aamodt Kilde is also on the comeback trail from a bad injury.\n\nAmerican figure skater Maxim Naumov's participation in the Milan-Cortina Games could be emotional as he makes his Olympic debut after his parents were killed in a plane crash in Washington DC last year.\n\nNaumov's dream to make Team USA was one of the last things he spoke about with his parents before they were killed.\n\nHis parents, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, skated for Russia and were world champions in pairs figure skating in 1994.\n\nSki mountaineering, or 'skimo', is making its Olympic debut at Milan-Cortina and, while Great Britain have failed to qualify an athlete in the Games' new sport, France's Emily Harrop is the next best thing.\n\nWith English parents, Harrop could have competed for Team GB but having relocated to the French Alps as a child she opted to represent France.\n\nHarrop is well placed for an Olympic medal having finished the 2025 season with seven wins out of seven races at the ski mountaineering World Cup, winning the sprint and overall crystal globe for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nDutch speed skater Jutta Leerdam will compete in the 1,000m and 500m in Milan.\n\nA former world sprint champion, Leerdam also won a silver medal in the 1,000m at the 2022 Beijing Olympics.\n\nShe is also engaged to YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, who can often be spotted at competitions and will be cheering her on from the sidelines in Italy.\n\nTeenager Finley Melville Ives arrives in Italy as one of the most exciting prospects on the freestyle skiing circuit.\n\nIves' parents are both snowboard instructors and his twin brother followed in their footsteps, but Ives opted instead for skis from a young age.\n\nHis breakout season came last year when he claimed his first World Cup victory in Calgary then weeks later became the halfpipe world champion in Engadin, Switzerland, beating Olympic greats Alex Ferreira and Nick Goepper along the way.\n\nBorn and raised in California, freestyle skier Eileen Gu was China's poster girl for Beijing 2022, where - aged 18 - she won gold in the big air and freeski halfpipe competitions and silver in the slopestyle.\n\nIn addition to her Olympic triumphs, she is also a two-time world champion and three-time Winter X Games champion.\n\nAway from the snow, Gu is one of the most famous winter sports athletes in the world and has modelled in New York, Barcelona, Paris and at Milan Fashion Week while also studying quantum physics at Stanford University.\n\nFor the first time since Sochi 2014, the National Hockey League is permitting its athletes to participate in the Winter Olympics.\n\nNHL stars did not travel to the 2018 or 2022 Games because of financial disputes and pandemic-related complications but will return to the ice this year.\n\nIn their absence, the last two men's titles have been won by Olympic teams from Russia and Finland while the United States failed to win a medal at both events, but this could be a huge boost to their hopes of returning to the podium.\n\nEight years after winning gold as a 17-year-old in Pyeongchang, American halfpipe snowboarder Chloe Kim is going for a three-peat in Italy.\n\nShe successfully defended her title in Beijing four years ago but her preparations for Milan-Cortina have been disrupted after she dislocated her shoulder at the beginning of the year.\n\nShe said in an update on Instagram she was \"good to go\" for the Games, where she will aim to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe.\n\nLegendary German bobsleigh pilot Francesco Friedrich arrives in Italy hoping to become the first man do the treble double - winning two and four-man gold for the third Games in a row.\n\nHe is a 16-time world champion across the two and four-man events while he has well over 100 World Cup podium finishes, claiming a 50th victory in the two-man earlier this year.\n\nGermany tend to dominate the Olympic bobsleigh events and the question is whether anyone can stop him from making history.\n\nCompeting at her sixth Games, Arianna Fontana is an 11-time Winter Olympic medallist and has won medals at her five previous appearances - including as a 15-year-old in Turin.\n\nTwenty years later, the short track skater is also aiming to compete in long track speed skating.\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion Fontana will also be one of Italy's flag bearers at the opening ceremony at the San Siro.\n\nNorwegian-born skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen could make history in Italy by winning a first Winter Olympics medal for a South American country after he switched allegiance to compete for his mother's home country of Brazil.\n\nThe slalom and giant slalom expert retired in 2023 having competed for Norway but returned in 2025 to represent Brazil and became the first Brazilian to finish on a World Cup podium last year before claiming the country's first victory this season to add to his five for Norway.\n\nA charismatic and deep-thinking character, Braathen says that people don't believe him when he tells them he represents Brazil in alpine skiing.\n\nAge: 18 Nation: Independent Neutral Athlete\n\nRussian skater Adeliia Petrosian is one of around 20 Russian or Belarusian athletes competing under a neutral flag in Italy.\n\nThe teenager had not competed internationally at senior level until the Olympic qualifiers because of the ban on Russian athletes but is a genuine medal contender having won the qualifying event.\n\nShe is coached by the controversial Eteri Tutberidze, who coached Kamila Valieva during the Beijing 2022 Olympics. Valieva was given a four-year ban for doping after she helped Russia to win team gold before it was then revealed she had failed a drug test before the start of the Games.\n\nIlia Malinin is the only skater to have successfully landed the quadruple Axel, skating's most difficult jump, in competition, earning him the nickname the 'Quad God'.\n\nThe American, born to Olympic figure skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, is the hot favourite for the men's singles title in Italy with previous routines including seven quads and a back flip.\n\nThe reigning world champion will be competing at his first Olympics having controversially been left out of the US team in Beijing.",

    "description": "Head coach Derek McInnes concedes that Premiership leaders Hearts were punished for \"playing with fire\" as a third red card in five matches contributes to a 1-0 defeat at St Mirren.",
    "fullText": "Derek McInnes conceded that Hearts were punished for \"playing with fire\" as a third red card in five matches contributed to a 1-0 defeat at St Mirren.\n\nCraig Halkett was dismissed for the Premiership leaders on 29 minutes for felling Jacob Devaney near the edge of the penalty area, following an error from fellow centre-back Stuart Findlay.\n\nA depleted Hearts got the better of both Dundee and St Mirren in January but they could not find a way to win this time as Miguel Freckleton's 88th-minute header consigned them to a third league defeat of the season.\n\nHearts remain six points ahead of Celtic and Rangers, with the Glasgow duo in action on Wednesday.\n\n\"We've seen before in recent weeks about when we go down to 10 men, I think there's a belief there that we can go and get results and I think that showed in the performance when we went down to 10 men,\" said McInnes.\n\n\"But we've got to own the fact that we can't keep getting away with it, you can't keep playing with fire.\n\n\"It's a red card, there's no complaint about that, but we caused it, we got ourselves into a fankle.\n\n\"We had two opportunities to play it forward, and we get ourselves in a bit of a state, and it culminates in a last-gasp challenge, and we've paid for it.\n\n\"From that point on, it was just making sure we kept it at zero for as long as we can and then hope for a moment (at the other end).\"\n\nPremiership leaders Hearts slip to defeat at St Mirren\n\nMcInnes was proud of Hearts' application after Halkett's dismissal but was left exasperated by Freckleton's set-piece goal.\n\n\"It was tough because we put so much into the game,\" he said.\n\n\"After we went down to 10 men, I thought the lads were everything I expected them to be. We restricted St Mirren to very little.\n\n\"The irony is the ball was going for a goal kick, and we pushed it by for a corner. Then we've just got to win a header in the dying embers of the game, and we get our point, which it would be hard to deny we didn't deserve based on the spirit and everything else.\n\n\"But ultimately we don't pick up properly, we don't attack the ball properly, and it's in the back of the net, and we end up with nothing for our efforts.\"\n\nFormer Hearts forward Ryan Stevenson: \"Everyone will look back at the sending off as the pivotal moment. From minute one was pivotal. The way they started the game, it's the first time I've seen them this season as bad as that.\n\n\"The sending off was calamitous. In that video meeting, watching it back, they'll be cringing. There were so many wrong decisions.\n\n\"It was so bad, all across the park. They never held the ball up up top, didn't make runs in behind to ask questions.\n\n\"They were so passive, St Mirren won every second ball that bounced in the middle of the park.\n\n\"It happens. Everybody will jump on the bandwagon and say 'this is it, they're stuttering'.\n\n\"They've never been in this position. It's been 40 years since Aberdeen were in this position, none of us are used to this.\n\n\"If I were Derek McInnes I'd be saying 'you've got the weekend off, what a game to bounce back in with the derby on Tuesday night'.\n\n\"It's still in their hands. You can't be doom and gloom about it because they have to brush themselves down and go again but they cannot let that performance happen again.\n\nFormer St Mirren striker Steven Thompson: \"There'll be huge twists and turns before the end of the season. Tonight is a blip for Hearts, but it's difficult to win every game.\n\n\"Between now and the end of the season, a Motherwell or someone else is taking points off Rangers, Celtic and Hearts. They'll take points off each other.\n\n\"Hearts have set such a high bar and it was strange to be so far off it. Sometimes, when you're not playing well as a team, you can carry two or three passengers.\n\n\"Tonight, there was far too many. It doesn't happen often for this Hearts team but when it happens, you can't win games.\"\n\nVisit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Hearts news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "BBC Sport pundits Steph Houghton, Ellen White, Karen Bardsley and Jen Beattie rate each WSL club's transfer window - and you can too.",
    "fullText": "The Women's Super League winter transfer window closed on Tuesday - but which club did the best business?\n\nLeague-leaders Manchester City made a statement signing, reigning champions Chelsea had a quiet one and it was a busy month for struggling West Ham and Liverpool.\n\nWe asked former internationals Steph Houghton, Ellen White, Karen Bardsley and Jen Beattie for their opinions - and you can rate each club's dealings too.\n\nEvery WSL winter window transfer\n\nWSL: Latest updates as winter transfer window set to close\n\nSitting 11 points clear at the top of the WSL, Manchester City could not have hoped for much more at this point in the season.\n\nThe club's first WSL trophy since 2016 is well within their reach but the £600,000 addition of United States midfielder Sam Coffey from Portland Thorns will give Andree Jeglertz's side an extra boost going into the final eight games of the season.\n\n\"Coffey is a very shrewd signing,\" said former City captain Houghton. \"She has international experience and is a more defensive-minded midfielder, which City didn't really have.\"\n\nAny faint hopes Chelsea had of overhauling City to claim a seventh straight title have not been helped by the lack of recruitment this month, although Houghton was not surprised.\n\n\"Chelsea have got a really good squad already,\" she said. \"They've built one for the future and have experienced players as well. It's just at this moment in time they haven't been performing to the expectations we have seen.\"\n\nAfter Sunday's humiliating defeat by City, Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor indicated she had hoped for more January signings.\n\n\"I couldn't believe that. She has the strongest team quality-wise when looking at depth and signings made,\" former Scotland defender Beattie told BBC Women's Football Weekly.\n\n\"I could not tell you what positions she is looking to fill. There are no gaps.\"\n\nSecond-placed Manchester United, meanwhile, were active early on in the window, bringing in experienced Germany striker Lea Schuller, along with Sweden's Hanna Lundkvist and Ellen Wangerheim.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about where United want to take their women's team and the signing of Lea Schuller is the answer - she is prolific,\" Houghton said.\n\n\"Defensively, they've always been solid and now they've bought a really good all-round player to strengthen their forward line. They are right in the mix.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Champions Cup winners Arsenal have also added some young Swedish talent to their squad, with Smilla Holmberg the only new arrival in north London.\n\nAs Tottenham look to continue their fine start to the season and boost their chances of European football next term, Martin Ho has added a handful of new signings to his squad - including one of the world's best young talents in Signe Gaupset.\n\n\"Martin Ho has done a really good job of propelling them into the top half of the league and making them more consistent,\" said Houghton. \"I think Spurs have been really clever this window and are going from strength to strength.\"\n\nPromoted side London City Lionesses were the busiest team in the summer transfer window but they've taken a more measured approach this time around with just one new signing - France international Delphine Cascarino.\n\n\"She's clever, quick and I like watching her play,\" Houghton said of Cascarino. \"London City did a lot of their business in the summer and now all the foundations are there for them in the WSL.\"\n\nAston Villa, meanwhile, have shown ambition in bringing in Oriane Jean-Francois from Chelsea for £450,000 and they've also signed Arsenal defender Jenna Nighswonger on loan.\n\nEverton, who sit ninth, have opted to bring in two players on loan deals, with Manchester United's Hannah Blundell and Arsenal's Laila Harbert joining for the rest of the season.\n\nMeanwhile, 10th-placed Leicester have been more active, snapping up experienced WSL players Alisha Lehmann, Ashleigh Neville, Sarah Mayling and Rachel Williams to help distance themselves from the relegation play-off spot.\n\nBut it is the bottom two clubs - West Ham and Liverpool - who have been the busiest, each bringing in six new players.\n\nUnder new boss Rita Guarino, the Irons have strengthened their defence with the additions of Estelle Cascarino and Tuva Hansen while Katie Zelem - on loan from London City - adds experience to the midfield.\n\nHowever, key defenders Anouk Denton and Amber Tysiak have left the club.\n\nStruggling at the bottom of the table, Liverpool have reinforced across their squad to try to get out of trouble.\n\nSweden goalkeeper Jennifer Falk has already become the club's number-one goalkeeper, while Republic of Ireland midfielder Denise O'Sullivan became the club's record signing.\n\nIn attack, forwards Alice Bergstrom, Anna Josendal and Aurelie Csillag have all joined on permanent deals, along with Spurs striker Martha Thomas on loan.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Everton have sacked manager Brian Sorensen days after their first home win of the Women's Super League season.\n\nThey are fourth from bottom of the table under Sorensen, who was appointed in 2022.\n\n\"Sunday's first win of the season at Goodison Park was important, but it has become evident that a change of direction is necessary to ensure the progression on the pitch we are all striving for,\" said Everton CEO Angus Kinnear.\n\nCoaches Stephen Neligan and Ashley Toole have also left the club.\n\nEverton Under-18s coach Scott Phelan, 37, will take charge of the women's team for the rest of the season.\n\nWomen's first-team coach Jennifer Foster will remain at the club to work alongside Phelan, as will goalkeeping coach Ian McCaldon.\n\nEverton came from behind to claim a 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday thanks to two goals from Martina Fernandez, including an 89th-minute winner.\n\nThe victory moved them four points clear of bottom side Liverpool in the relegation place.\n\nThe timing of Everton's decision comes as a surprise, just hours after the transfer deadline closed and they added Roma midfielder Zara Kramzar to their ranks.\n\nSorensen has been involved in recruitment and many of their additions over the past two windows have suited his requests.\n\nBut the feeling a change of direction was needed has been lingering at Everton for several months.\n\nSupporters have grown increasingly frustrated by their performances with Sorensen seemingly still unsure on his best XI and often using players out of position.\n\nHis experimental style has been effective before and he should be praised for his management last season when Everton's injury crisis left a thin squad amid a time when the club were awaiting the completion of the Friedkin Group takeover.\n\nHowever, expectations grew this year when investment came, signings were made and the squad had enough quality to be challenging further up the table.\n\nThey have been dragged into an unnecessary relegation battle and Everton have acted now in the hope that they can do enough to stabilise their position before rebuilding in the summer.\n\nSorensen's overall time at Everton has shown his capabilities as a coach but the inability to field a consistent team has harmed his progression.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "James Harden is set to join the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Los Angeles Clippers, with Darius Garland moving in the opposite direction after the sides agreed a trade.\n\nHarden, 36, is an 11-time NBA All-Star and regarded as one of the greatest guards in history, but he has never won an NBA title.\n\nAlthough the deal is yet to be confirmed by the NBA, Harden said the opportunity to win a first championship was key in deciding to move.\n\nThe Cavaliers are fifth in the Eastern Conference in their pursuit of a play-off spot, while the Clippers are ninth in the West.\n\n\"I see an opportunity to win in the East - they got a very good team, coaching staff, all of the above,\" Harden told ESPN.\n\n\"As much as I wanted to stay in LA and give it a go, I've never won one before. As a basketball mind, I think we have a bit better chance.\"\n\nHarden has helped the Clippers climb the table after a dismal 6-21 start this season, but sat out Sunday's defeat by the Philadelphia 76ers while talks with the Cavaliers progressed.\n\nHarden, who won the NBA's Most Valuable Player Award in 2018 while with the Houston Rockets, denied speculation that he requested a trade from the Clippers.\n\n\"That wasn't the case at all. In life, not even just basketball, when things don't work out, there are ways to end things in relationships without having to crack each other,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe we just don't see a future with each other. Maybe we just outgrew each other. Whatever the case may be, I feel like our situations weren't like that.\"\n\nAcross stints at five franchises, Harden has scored 28,805 points, putting him ninth on the NBA's all-time list.\n\nThe Cavaliers have not won a title since 2016.\n\nGarland, 26, averages 18 points this season in a campaign blighted by injury.\n\nAs part of the trade, the Clippers secured a second-round pick for this year's draft.\n\nThe Clippers host the Cavaliers on Wednesday, but Harden and Garland must pass medicals before the trade is confirmed.",

    "description": "It is a matter of when, not if, Gregor Brown becomes a cornerstone of Scotland's forward pack, writes Tom English.",
    "fullText": "We are inching towards a sliding doors moment in the life of Gregor Brown.\n\nThe day is surely fast approaching when Brown is no longer quizzed about being Blair Kinghorn's cousin and when the Scotland full-back is instead asked what it is like being related to the Glasgow forward.\n\nIt is not exactly clear which position Brown is going to play for Scotland in the Six Nations, or indeed, if he starts or is on the bench, but there is one certainty - he is going to be pivotal to the team's hopes.\n\nThe 24-year-old is only really 18 months into his time as a top-level player - a whirlwind of progress that he calls \"insane\" - but his impact has been enormous.\n\nHe has played Test matches with four, five, six and seven on his back. He has started against France at lock and against New Zealand and Argentina at blindside flanker.\n\nHe was Jonny Gray's understudy in the Six Nations last season and by the summer had played some minutes for the British and Irish Lions in Australia.\n\n\"If I went back 18 months and you told me that I would have done all this, I would have laughed at you. Like, no way. It's just been absolutely mental,\" he told the Scotland Rugby Podcast.\n\nTrue, but Brown is a pivotal figure now for Townsend, a guy who gives the coach some questions to answer.\n\nTownsend's natural inclination for their Six Nations Opener against Italy in Rome on Saturday might be a second row of Grant Gilchrist and Scott Cummings.\n\nThat would leave Brown either starting at six or, more likely, on the bench covering lock and blindside.\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Brown's power, energy, footwork and all-round skill-set is indispensable. The only puzzler is how best to deploy it.\n\nThe man himself only sees the positives, no matter which way Townsend goes.\n\n\"Obviously, everyone wants to start, but I think a big growth in rugby over the past few years has been that it's an 80-minute game and that the bench has such an important role to play,\" he added.\n\n\"I have spoken about South Africa leading the way in that sense. When you're a pack and it gets to 50, 60 minutes and you see six or seven fresh forwards come on, it's like, 'right, we've got to up it now'.\n\n\"Test match rugby is physical, it's fast. When you get to those last 15, 20 minutes, it's usually the crunch time. The game is usually still in the balance at that point and it will be the bench making that difference.\"\n\nSo he's cool as a finisher, for now, even though plenty believe he should be in the second row alongside Cummings with Max Williamson as the bench lock.\n\n\"I remember Franco [Smith] talking about it. He was kind of joking but also being serious about how you have all your friends around to watch a rugby game and when it kicks off, people are getting a drink, snacks, going to the toilet,\" said Brown.\n\n\"But in that last 15, 20 minutes, everybody is sat glued to the TV and that's when the bench are on.\n\n\"This old-school mindset of secondary players coming on is just not what it is any more. Off the bench, you can bring more punch, more dynamism in the carries, tackles, things like that.\n\n\"Everyone wants to start, but at the same time, being involved in a Scotland team is one of the greatest honours you can have and I dreamed of it as a kid. I'm not going to kick my heels if I'm on the bench. Being involved is absolutely huge.\"\n\n'Uncage the gorilla' - Schoeman knows what Scots must improve\n\nWhy autumn pain can bring Scotland Six Nations gain\n\nThe strength of Scotland's bench is particularly relevant given how many times they have fallen away late in games, which was a bit of a theme in their camp last week.\n\nStacking the bench as much as he can makes sense. It will be fascinating to see what Townsend does when he names the team on Thursday to face Italy.\n\nIn Brown, he has a player who is growing up fast. His cameo with the Lions - the highlight of which was coming on for James Ryan in the battle against First Nations & Pasifika in Melbourne - has only helped the process.\n\nIt was brief, sure, but he made the most of it.\n\n\"I was only there for a few days but being in the same environment as some of the best players in the world was absolutely incredible,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got my jersey and I still look at it. I'm just like, 'wow!'\n\n\"What came out from a lot of the Scottish lads is that a lot of the stuff that we do is right up there. We're sometimes just that one step away. Let's go and take that next step.\"",

    "description": "Shaka Hislop says it is \"alarming\" that tests for prostate cancer are not \"regular and \"standardised\" in the United Kingdom.",
    "fullText": "Former Premier League goalkeeper Shaka Hislop says it is \"alarming\" that tests for prostate cancer are not \"regular and standardised\" in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe 56-year-old was diagnosed with the disease in 2024 after he requested a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test during his annual medical examination in the United States.\n\nRoutine PSA testing is not offered by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, with the screening usually only provided if you are over 50 and other symptoms are identified.\n\nAccording to research from Prostate Cancer UK, one in eight males will be diagnosed with the disease at some point in their life.\n\nIn black males, meanwhile, that risk is as high as one in four.\n\nThe former Trinidad and Tobago keeper - who now lives in the United States - believes the current testing protocol for the disease is flawed and needs changing, especially with cancer's rising prominence in certain ethnic communities.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast programme, Hislop said: \"I honestly can't believe that it is still a thing given all we know of prostate cancer and its prominence, particularly in the minority community.\n\n\"So, to have that not be a regular and standardised test as offered to people regardless of whether they have any family history or not, I find alarming.\n\n\"I have no history of prostate cancer in my family yet here I am having been diagnosed and been treated for it.\"\n\nSince his diagnosis, Hislop has tried to approach the prostate cancer with the same \"fight\" he had during a professional career that spanned six clubs in England, including West Ham and Newcastle.\n\nBut it has been difficult for his wife to deal with because of an \"emotional history\" with the disease.\n\n\"My father‑in‑law died of prostate cancer, so I can't imagine what my wife was going through when she heard my news, knowing her emotional history with prostate cancer, having to deal with that and still be strong for me,\" said Hislop.\n\n\"For me, it was slightly different in that I understand why they say fight cancer, because that was the only emotion I felt: 'All right, this is a fight.' And that's exactly the way I saw it.\n\n\"This was me against cancer - or me and a surgical team against cancer. That was my mindset. I never felt beaten, I never felt demoralised. I never felt sorry. This was just another fight in my life.\n\n\"Much the same way I kind of approached a football game, where you focus solely on that.\n\n\"It's the only thing that mattered and that was my entire mindset throughout.\n\n\"I know from speaking to people who've been diagnosed with prostate cancer that the initial emotional gut punch is tough.\n\n\"But I processed it differently. I just felt that this was a fight. Here we go. Let's, you know, put the gloves on and have a go at this.\"\n\nHislop is not the first former professional athlete to urge the NHS to change its testing regime.\n\nIn 2024, six-time Olympic gold medalist Sir Chris Hoy told the BBC it would be a \"no-brainier\" to lower the age that males are eligible to request PSA tests.\n\nThe previous year, Hoy, 49, was diagnosed with prostate cancer which had spread to his bones. He was told he had between two and four years to live.\n\nIn November 2025, the UK National Screening Committee decided against recommending mass screening on the NHS for prostate cancer, saying the main screening test for prostate cancer is \"not very reliable\" and as a result, can lead to \"over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment\".\n\nSpeaking to Naga Munchetty on BBC Radio 5 Live on Tuesday, health secretary Wes Streeting said the government is \"still considering and weighing up the evidence.\"\n\n\"It's not done and dusted,\" he added. \"On one hand we know there are massive health inequalities in this space, for black men in particular. On the other hand what we wouldn't want, in pursuit of expanding treatment, is to end up in another situation where we've got a bunch of men walking around impotent or incontinent because we've over-treated or unnecessarily treated.\"\n\nHislop is hoping that by ex-athletes documenting their battles against prostate cancer, it will increase the \"education\" around diagnosis.\n\n\"Cancer can affect anyone,\" added Hislop. \"The earlier you catch it - whatever the cancer is - the better your chance of survival. So knowledge is key here. Knowledge around your own health is absolutely key.\n\n\"The other side to that is, if and when you do get that cancer diagnosis, that does not mean it's the end of life. That is not a life sentence.\n\n\"If you catch it early enough, and again this goes back to the education around it, around early testing, you can still live a full and very long life. That's certainly my expectation now.\n\n\"When the likes of Sir Chris Hoy, who again, keeping himself in shape, former athlete, is not caught early enough, the diagnosis can be very dire.\n\n\"So there are two sides to this: education around who can get cancer - and the short answer to that is anyone - and then just recognising that you're part of that group of anyone, and getting tested for it, because the earlier you catch it, the better your chances of living as full a life as ever before.\n\n\"So those two things I think are important to know, to understand, to recognise and to speak about.\"\n\nThis interview is part of BBC Radio 5 Live's You, Me and the Big C legacy day, and you can listen to a brand new episode of the You, Me and the Big C podcast - now available on BBC Sounds.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "In a wide-ranging interview, Brendon McCullum talks about Harry Brook's altercation with a nightclub bouncer and the criticism of England's off-field behaviour.",
    "fullText": "England head coach Brendon McCullum has defended Harry Brook, the off-field behaviour of his Ashes squad and his own leadership style, describing some of the criticism they have received in the last few months as a \"pile on\".\n\nSpeaking after England's 3-0 T20 series victory over Sri Lanka, McCullum argued the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had handled the fallout from their challenging winter tours \"pretty well\".\n\nEngland white-ball captain Brook has come under significant scrutiny after it was revealed he was punched by a nightclub bouncer on England's tour of New Zealand that preceded the Ashes.\n\nIt was subsequently revealed he had lied about being alone for the encounter and was accompanied by several team-mates - a stance McCullum defended, saying the 25-year-old was trying to \"look after his mates\".\n\nThe story followed England's Ashes squad being criticised for a mid-series break in Noosa where several players were reported to be drinking excessively.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, McCullum, who will lead England in the T20 World Cup which begins in India and Sri Lanka this week, also said:\n\nHe didn't think the ECB needs \"to release findings every time something arises\" around player disciplinaries\n\nThe criticism of his players \"can go too far\" and he finds continual discussion of disciplinary proceedings \"quite annoying\"\n\nBrook is an \"outstanding\" leader on the field and \"wears his intelligence lightly\"\n\nHe didn't think his players \"went overboard\" on a mid-Ashes series holiday in Noosa where they were pictured drinking, calling the Queensland resort \"a place where people go and retire\"\n\nIn terms of his own future, he'd \"like to finish what we started\" and hopes to be in charge beyond the T20 World Cup\n\nEngland beat Sri Lanka by 12 runs on Tuesday, and carry momentum from an undefeated T20 tour that was preceded by a 2-1 ODI series win.\n\nAfterwards, however, New Zealander McCullum, 44, was keen to rally round his captain and players.\n\nHe spoke repeatedly of the need to protect cricketers from the unique pressures of a year-round fixture list and believes disciplinary procedures should be kept private - saying Brook was \"keen to put his hand up when the information came that it was going to land in the media\".\n\n\"It seems like we keep going on and on and on about it,\" he said. \"I think these guys, they know that they've made a mistake and they've put their hand up.\n\n\"Harry was trying to look after his mates and in the end, people say what they want but our job is to look after him.\n\n\"Our job is to make sure we support these guys and I think sometimes the criticism can go too far.\n\n\"When we're made aware of things that haven't gone right, we discipline them, we have a stern word and deal with things internally.\n\n\"I don't think we need to release those findings every time something arises. We feel like we deal with them and we've dealt with the processes of the last little while pretty well.\"\n\nAsked whether the ECB could have been more transparent about Brook's altercation, McCullum reiterated: \"I don't think there was any need to release the details until it was found in the media.\n\n\"And to be honest, I find it quite annoying that we keep going on and on about it because these are young men who are under immense pressure that have put their hands up, been disciplined for it and piling onto them is not helpful for anyone.\"\n\nThe Daily Telegraph have reported that Brook, Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue could be subject to an investigation from the cricket regulator with regard to the incident in Wellington, which occurred the night before a one-day international which England lost.\n\nThe incident, which happened in November, did not come to light in the media until January, and followed a mid-Ashes break in Noosa which also drew criticism for some excessive drinking by players.\n\n\"Cricket is 12 months a year, you have to be able to enjoy yourselves. I don't think the boys went overboard at all,\" McCullum said of the Noosa trip.\n\n\"A lot of the pile-on for it was completely out of line. Noosa is where people go and retire, there's a reason why we chose Noosa.\n\n\"It's being made [out] as this big stag do place, it couldn't be further from that. If we wanted a stag do and we wanted a tear up, we'd have gone to the Gold Coast.\"\n\nMcCullum's leadership style has drawn criticism from outsiders, with some feeling the players are given too much freedom on and off the pitch.\n\nHowever, McCullum bristled at such sentiments and believes his message has been misinterpreted by those outside the dressing room.\n\n\"I think you guys [journalists] have got to work me out a little bit better to be honest,\" he said.\n\n\"If you go back to the day I walked into the job, the first thing I said to these boys is don't do anything that lands you on the front page of the paper and nothing good happens after midnight, but we're going to have a good time.\n\n\"[I said] we're going to grow, we're going to enjoy ourselves, cricket is a tough game, it has its challenges mentally, which we've seen with many people that have played cricket in the past, but we're going to try and play a style of cricket that allows us to succeed.\n\n\"I'm not against making sure these boys are controlled in a manner. It's [about] looking after them to ensure they don't make mistakes. The curfew is a different interpretation of the words I mentioned three and a half years ago.\"\n\nMcCullum said he thought there was a \"misconception\" that he ran a \"loose ship\" and wanted everyone out drinking, and that he didn't care about cricket.\n\n\"It couldn't be further from the truth,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm fiercely determined, I'm fiercely competitive and I want the best for these guys, and I want the best for English cricket.\"\n\nEngland start their World Cup campaign against Nepal on Sunday, 8 February (09:30 GMT).\n\nBrook will lead the team in India and Sri Lanka and McCullum says he is impressed by the Yorkshireman's captaincy so far.\n\n\"I think Harry Brook is an outstanding leader on the field,\" he added. \"His tactical acumen is as good as I've seen in a short period of time from a young man.\n\n\"He has work to do off the field without a doubt, as do some of the other young lads we have in our side - and that's what happens when you come in at 20 and you're growing up on a world stage with spotlight, fame, fortune and the pressure that comes with it.\n\n\"He's a strong leader, he's a young man but he's got a very good head on his shoulders. People will say he's not that clever, I couldn't disagree with that more, he wears his intelligence lightly and he's a very strong leader.\n\n\"He's a player they play for in that dressing room and our job is to keep looking after him because he is young and he's got his best days in front of him.\"\n\nBooze, beach, beaten - how England lost the Ashes\n\nBrook lied 'to protect' others after nightclub altercation\n\nEngland investigate Ashes drinking as video emerges\n\nBrook apologises after nightclub altercation",

Absolutely gutted.\"\n\nFour-time world champion Mark Selby said: \"So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo! Such a great guy and a huge character! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.\"\n\nFormer world champion Shaun Murphy, who worked alongside Virgo for the BBC, said: \"I first met John in 1994, filming Junior Big Break. He then went on to become a friend and colleague.\n\n\"I learned so much from him whilst sharing a commentary box. The voice of snooker will be sadly missed.\"\n\nVirgo regularly took part in exhibition matches, playing trick shots and performing impressions of other players.\n\nFormer world champion Neil Robertson said: \"He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator.\n\n\"I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was.\"\n\nA World Snooker statement read: \"Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo.\"\n\nFormer world number three Neal Foulds said: \"Terribly sad news that we have lost one of the greats of snooker in John Virgo.\n\n\"JV was incredibly generous, kind and funny. He was also a wonderful player and commentator. Thanks for all the great memories JV.\"\n\nVirgo, who was born in Salford in 1946, is survived by wife Rosie and children Gary and Brooke-Leah.\n\nJohn was a tremendous competitor and a very good break-builder - brilliant among the pink and black. He knew the game inside and out and backwards.\n\nThen he transcended the sport and went into the commentary box. He did Big Break with Jim Davidson, so he became a household name to everybody.\n\nIt was that voice which was very different to everyone else and made him stand out.\n\nYou could have a right laugh with him - he loved a joke.\n\nHe had a really good act and he did impersonations of Alex Higgins, Terry Griffiths, Cliff Thorburn - and they all loved it.\n\nIt was unusual for someone to do that at the end of an exhibition, but he was absolutely brilliant at it.\n\nI'm sure when we give him a tribute at the Crucible [for the World Championship in April] they will show his impressions routine, which is just hilarious.\n\nVirgo on the Snookered podcast in 2023",

    "fullText": "Four years is a long time to wait to right a wrong.\n\nIn Beijing in 2022, Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds forfeited a lead in their mixed doubles curling semi-final against Norway. Gold was gone. Silver too.\n\nEven bronze evaded them against an inspired Sweden the following day.\n\nOn Wednesday, in the snowy splendour of Cortina d'Ampezzo in northern Italy, the chance will come for the Team GB duo to make amends as they face the Norwegians again in the first of nine round-robin matches at the 2026 Games.\n\nIn the first action of this year's event, the childhood friends from Edinburgh will reprise their rivalry with the husband and wife team of Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien, who took silver four years ago after claiming bronze in 2018.\n\n\"That first game that we played at the mixed doubles was the most nervous either of us have ever been in a game,\" Mouat said earlier this week.\n\n\"And then when we got to the semi, that feeling came back. But this time, we have experience and we're going to rely heavily on that.\"\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nWhat's happening and when at the Winter Olympics?\n\nMeet the 17 Scots in Team GB for Winter Olympics\n\nThat experience comes in the shape of an Olympic medal each. Dodds was part of the women's team that won gold in Beijing, while Mouat's men claimed silver.\n\n\"Our friendship really helps out too,\" Dodds added of a relationship that stretches back 24 years. \"We've got 100% trust and support from one another and that creates a really safe environment for us.\"\n\nWhen they arrived on Tuesday for their first look at the quirky Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium - which was built for the 1956 Games - both excitedly spoke about finally getting on the ice, their selection having been confirmed last June.\n\nThey will now only have to wait until 18:00 GMT on Wednesday to do so, in a contest that will be live on the BBC iPlayer as well as the BBC Sport website & app.\n\nGold is the aim again for the Scottish rink, who are one of four recent mixed doubles world champions competing in Cortina.\n\nHosts Italy are holders and beat Mouat and Dodds in last year's World Championship final; 2024 winners Sweden have a brother and sister combination; and Switzerland and Canada also have husband and wife teams.",

    "description": "Jack Draper says he has had to overcome \"lots of dark moments\" during his injury lay-off as he prepares to make his long-awaited return in Great Britain's Davis Cup qualifier against Norway in Oslo",
    "fullText": "Jack Draper says he has had to overcome \"lots of dark moments\" during his injury lay-off as he prepares to make his long-awaited return in Great Britain's Davis Cup qualifier against Norway in Oslo.\n\nThe 24-year-old's 2025 season was derailed by an injury to his upper left arm which first flared up during the clay-court season in the spring. He has played just one singles match since his second round exit at Wimbledon.\n\nDraper, the British number one, had previously been enjoying a breakout season, reaching the fourth round at the Australian Open and French Open, winning his maiden Masters 1000 title in Indian Wells, and climbing to a career-high ranking of four in June.\n\nAlthough he attempted a comeback at the US Open, partnering Jessica Pegula in the mixed doubles and winning his first round singles match, he later pulled out of the tournament due to injury.\n\nHe subsequently withdrew from the Ultimate Tennis Showdown in December and did not travel to Melbourne for the Australian Open.\n\n\"[It's] been a long time since I've been able to compete. I've stayed in a good place, although it's been tricky [with] a lot of dark moments and a lot of tough times, but that's the sport I signed up for,\" Draper told the LTA website.\n\n\"I'm happy to be back playing again. I miss the buzz of competing. I've missed the thrill of playing in front of people, against great players, and that winning feeling you can't replicate in training.\n\n\"It's going to feel great to get back out there again.\"\n\nGB back in Davis Cup elite with 'really good chance'\n\nDraper, who has dropped down to number 13 in the rankings, hopes last year's positive start can serve as motivation as he attempts to return to the top.\n\n\"Last year started off amazingly well. The second half was extremely challenging,\" Draper said.\n\n\"I took a lot of belief and confidence from the first half of the year and what I achieved. I kept in mind that I want to be competing right at the top of the game.\n\n\"It's going to be a bit of a challenge and a journey to get back to where I was because I've been out for such a long time but at the same time, I'm constantly getting better and improving, and I hope I get to show that sooner rather than later.\"\n\nTen-time Davis Cup champions Great Britain have only lifted the trophy once since the 1930s - an Andy Murray-led triumph in 2015 - and fell to Japan at the first hurdle last year.\n\nGreat Britain beat Poland 3-1 in September to retain their place in the top tier.\n\nThey head to Oslo, where their first-round qualifier will be held from on February 6 and February 7, as the favourites to advance. The squad features two singles players ranked inside the top 30 in Draper and Cameron Norrie, British number three Jacob Fearnley, and a Grand Slam-winning doubles pairing in Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash.\n\nHosts Norway are yet to confirm the availability of world number 12 Casper Ruud after he became a father last week.\n\nDraper says Great Britain have to be prepared to \"fight for every point\" against an \"amazing\" Norway team.\n\n\"They've got a young player in [Nicolai Budkov] Kjaer, who was number one in the world juniors and playing great tennis on the tour. He'll be tough to beat – a young guy who's got a lot to prove,\" Draper said.\n\n\"We all know Casper Ruud has been a top-10 banker player for a long time.\n\n\"It's going to be a great challenge for us all but I think we're ready to embrace it and fight for every point.\"\n\nThe winner of this tie will face either Australia or Ecuador in a second round qualifier for a spot at November's Davis Cup Finals in Italy.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "The world's oldest rugby tournament is the stage for a clutch of young stars to make their name.",
    "fullText": "Who will seize the Six Nations stage and make a name for themselves over the next six weeks?\n\nHere is a player from each nation who could appear in the tournament for the first time.\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThe son of hard-hitting former Tonga international Keni Fisilau, number eight Greg has been a key part of Exeter's revival this season. His ball-carrying, which combines nimble footwork and raw go-forward power has helped the 22-year-old to five Prem tries so far in this campaign.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Greg's father didn't allow him to play touch rugby as a youngster, concerned he would pick up bad habits of trying to stop runners with his hands, rather than his shoulder.\n\nIt looks like it paid off as Plymouth-born Fisilau has made the eighth highest number of tackles in the English top flight.\n\nHis route into the England team is a tough one, however, with back row a position of particular depth for coach Steve Borthwick.\n\nBut for injury, Edogbo could easily have featured in this list for a previous Six Nations.\n\nThe 23-year-old second row spent nearly two years on the sidelines with Achilles tendon tears, but is now up to speed and could add heft to an Ireland pack that has, on occasions, looked lightweight against the very best.\n\nStanding 6ft 5in tall and weighing 20 stone, he has scored three tries in nine games this season for Munster.\n\nEdogbo was a relatively late convert to rugby, only picking up a ball as a 13-year-old after his younger brother Sean - a promising back row prospect himself - took it up.\n\nAway from the pitch, he is in the final year of an economics degree at University College Cork.\n\nWill head coach Andy Farrell dare to pair him with the similarly powerful Joe McCarthy in the engine room, or use Edogbo as a possible stand-in for his Leinster rival? Or perhaps he is earmarked for an impact bench role?\n\nIt took only seven minutes of Kalvin Gourgues' Test debut last November for the hype train to gather even more steam.\n\nThe 20-year-old, coming on as a late replacement for Gael Fickou, received the ball on his own 22-metre line and ghosted through the heart of Australia's midfield before casually slinging a dart of a pass out for Louis Bielle-Biarrey to score.\n\nWith Fickou left out of defending champions France's initial Six Nations squad, Gourgues' time seems to be coming fast.\n\nHis versatility is another string to his bow. As well as covering both midfield spots, he has previously played full-back and started at 10 for Toulouse recently.\n\nCoach Fabien Galthie has trusted him as the backline replacement in a six-two bench for the opening game against Ireland on Thursday.\n\nGourgues' prodigious rise is all the more impressive considering he spent nearly a year out of the game recently to fix a circulation problem that could ultimately have cost him his leg.\n\nHe had an artery in his foot replaced by one from his thigh and is scanned every month to ensure his blood flow is back to normal.\n\nGregor Townsend's faith in Freddy Douglas is clear. The Scotland coach handed Douglas, then 19, a Test debut before he had even made a top-level club appearance for Edinburgh.\n\nIn taking to the pitch for the final 15 minutes of a 59-21 win over Portugal in November 2024, Douglas became the youngest man to represent Scotland in more than 60 years.\n\nIt wasn't all straightforward from there, though, as an ankle injury sidelined him shortly afterwards and he was frustrated to be overlooked for the autumn internationals.\n\nHowever Douglas' low-slung jackalling ability, aided by yoga stretching that he has done since he was a teenager,, external has impressed this season and delivered a fistful of turnovers. He has also bulked up to do more of the heavy-duty ball-carrying on the gainline.\n\nHaving packed down opposite Henry Pollock at under-20 level, could he make a similarly steep climb to prominence?\n\nYou could understand Welsh fans getting nervous when one of their age-grade prospects goes west.\n\nImmanuel Feyi-Waboso, like Hennessey, was a Cardiff Schools star and Wales age-grade regular, who headed to England to combine university studies with professional rugby.\n\nBut while Feyi-Waboso switched to represent England at senior level, Hennessey is staying firmly on track.\n\nA classy centre, with physicality, quick feet and playmaking ability, he has also turned out on the wing for English champions Bath. And he has come into form at the right time.\n\nCardiff-born Hennessey ran in a try in a win over Gloucester in the most recent round of Prem matches to ensure that, after getting a first senior call-up in the autumn, the 21-year-old kept his place for the Six Nations.\n\nItaly's plans have been disrupted by injuries. As well as star back Ange Capuozzo's broken finger, they are missing back-row stalwarts Ross Vintcent and Sebastian Negri.\n\nThe latter pair's absence may provide a route into the team for the uncapped 24-year-old Samuele Locatelli, who has been in fine form.\n\nHe was voted player of the year in the Italian top flight while playing for Viadana and has risen to impress in the United Rugby Championship with Zebre.\n\nA Test appearance would cap a remarkable mid-career rise.\n\nSix Nations fixtures and how to follow on the BBC\n\nSix Nations preview & BBC pundit predictions\n\nWhat impact might 'unprecedented' Six Nations schedule have?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Olympics stand as the most prestigious sporting event worldwide.\n\nEvery two years, athletes from hundreds of nations gather in a single location, alternating between summer and winter Games. They compete for medals and national pride, pushing the world's top competitors.\n\nItaly is honored to host the 2026 Winter Olympics from February 6 to February 22. This will be Italy's fourth time hosting the Olympics and its first since 2006.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the 2026 Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nMORE: Who are the biggest USA Olympic hockey snubs?\n\nThe 2026 Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nCortina d'Ampezzo has previously hosted the Olympics, but only the Summer Games. This is the first time Milan is hosting the Olympics, and it is also Cortina d'Ampezzo's first time hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\nHere's a list of each time Italy has hosted the Olympics:\n\nMilan and Cortina d'Ampezzo host 15 Olympic venues. Below is a full list of the sports scheduled at each location.\n\nMilano San Siro Olympic Stadium\n\nMilano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena\n\nCortina Curling Olympic Stadium\n\nCurling, wheelchair curling, Paralympic closing ceremony\n\nAlpine skiing, para alpine skiing\n\nTesero Cross-Country Skiing Stadium\n\nCross-country skiing, Nordic combined, para biathlon, para cross-country skiing\n\nAlpine skiing, ski mountaineering\n\nOlympic closing ceremony, Paralympic opening ceremony\n\nThe time difference can significantly affect viewers wanting to watch the Olympic Games. Fortunately, the Winter Games pose less of a challenge for those in the Eastern Time Zone. Italy is six hours ahead of EST and nine hours ahead of Pacific Time.\n\nThe 2021 Tokyo Olympics experienced a harsh 14-hour time difference, making viewing difficult. In contrast, the 2026 Games will be more accessible for U.S. fans to watch live without disrupting their sleep routines.\n\nMORE: When will the Olympics be in USA?\n\nHosting the Olympic Games is a great honor, but it comes with high costs. The organizers of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics have announced an operating budget of approximately \"1.7 billion euros\" ($1.9 billion).\n\nThe International Olympic Committee will provide approximately $1 billion in extra funding for the February 6-22 Games. At the same time, the Italian government is investing over $1 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance access to the venues.\n\nAlthough this appears substantial, Russia reportedly invested $51 billion to host the 2014 Sochi Games, a cost that is expected to remain an Olympic record for many years to come.\n\nThe Milano Cortina Olympics will welcome thousands of athletes from across the world for the 2026 Winter Games. They'll stay in one of the six Olympic Villages spread across northern Italy.\n\nThe locations include Milan, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo, Anterselva (Antholz), and Cortina.\n\nIt is said that after the games, some villages will be converted into student housing.",

    "fullText": "LAKELAND — The 2025-26 Lakeland Christian boys soccer team wasn’t Grandy Streets’ most talented team, but it certainly was one of Streets’ favorite group to coach. It was an overachieving group of players who gave him their all.\n\nUnfortunately for the Vikings, it wasn’t enough on Tuesday night.\n\nTampa Berkeley Prep gained the momentum for about 15 minutes during the second half, and Matthew Carroll scored the only goal of the match in the 66th minute to defeat Lakeland Christian, 1-0, in the Class 1A, Region 3 quarterfinals.\n\nThe Vikings season came to and end, but the finished 9-7-2 and claimed another district title.\n\nBoys Soccer: McKeel takes district, now looks to fulfill its potential\n\nGirls Soccer: Sylvia Rodriguez, Hayden Fullwood lead Victory Christian soccer for playoff run\n\n“It's been a really fun year,” Streets said. “It's probably been one of the top teams I've ever coached as far as experiences. I’m very proud of all of them.”\n\nWhile there is a core of underclassmen whom Streets will build around, the Vikings will have to replace the defensive core, led by goalkeeper Ben Harrison. He made a couple of outstanding saves against Berkeley Prep that kept LCS in the match.\n\n“He’s a phenomenal goalkeeper,” Sreets said.\n\nThe other seniors who led LCS were Micah Roloff, Reyeker Bradford and Kristian Spann. And it’s not just their play on the field that has to be replace.\n\n“The leadership of Micah is phenomenal,” Streets said. “He's probably the best leader I've ever had. I've never had a leader like that. Same thing with Ben — just tremendous leadership.”\n\nGoing forward, LCS will build around Jackson Castano, Parker Wilson, Parker Harrell, Ryder Sullivan, Evan Grieger, Jackson Green and Dylan Coyle.\n\n“I like all the kids that are on this team,” Streets said. “There’s about eight who are going to return who are very good, and then there’s your JV team and our middle school. We have a lot of young eighth- and ninth-graders who are fantastic players. It’ll be a young team for the next couple of years, and in a few years, they’re going to be something special.”\n\nAlso in 1A, Region 3, Fort Meade’s season came to an end as Carrollwood Day defeated the Miners, 8-0.\n\nStryker Holmes scored three goals and added two assists to lead McKeel in the regional quarterfinals.\n\nWilliam Johnson and Daniel Rathore each had two goals and one assist. Jurem Alejo also had a goal. Ian Acevedo picked up two assists, and Milan Chivraman added one assist.\n\nMcKeel advanced to play at Calary Christian at 7 p.m. on Feb. 10 in the regional semifinals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Ledger: Boys soccer: Lakeland Christian, Fort Meade falls, McKeel advances",

    "description": "This is a team which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",
    "fullText": "Monday’s convincing victory over Burnley has virtually guaranteed Sunderland’s Premier League status for next season, with more than a third of fixtures still to play.\n\nIt was also the sixth occasion where the squad has responded to a defeat with a win — that speaks to the mentality of the group of players who have been blended together from last season’s promotion-winning heroes and the carefully selected cohort of summer recruits.\n\nThe ability to bounce back after disappointing performances against the likes of Burnley in August, Manchester United in October and West Ham in January is testament to the belief that Régis Le Bris has instilled in what has proved to be the surprise package of the season.\n\nIt is not just the fact that this is a team full of talented players which gives the squad character. It is that the club have recruited talented players who have the right character to play for this club, and for this coach.\n\nFor a goalkeeper of his age and experience, Robin Roefs should not have the calm temperament to control his area in the manner that he does. Ahead of him, he has Nordi Mukiele whose will to win is demonstrated, not only by his galloping forays down the wing, but by his willingness to put his body on the line. Dan Ballard embodies the ‘Til the end’ mentality that dragged this team back to the Premier League, Omar Alderete has the ice-cool mentality and ruggedness of a South American gangster, and Reinildo wanders round the Academy of Light in January in a sleeveless vest, as if he was back in Mozambique.\n\nTrai Hume has continued to deliver the kind of no-nonsense, hard-as-nails performances that make his price tag the steal of the century, while Granit Xhaka patrols the midfield with the mindset of a military commander determined to deliver victory on the battlefield.\n\nBeside him, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra bring an African energy, skill, enthusiasm and joy that we haven’t seen since the days of Asamoah Gyan, while Enzo Le Fée’s creativity is only matched by his never-say-die attitude to win back the ball every single time the team loses possession.\n\nUp front, Brian Brobbey is delivering the kind of no-nonsense muscular front-man performances that the Sunderland faithful have been desperately seeking for years, shrugging off defenders like annoying flies. On the wing, Chemsdine Talbi not only grafts back defensively but has delivered the spectacular finishes that excite crowds.\n\nAdd to that the loveable Wilson Isidor, Wembley hero Eliezer Mayenda and ‘Mr Sunderland’ Luke O’Nien, and this is a group of players who deserve to be celebrated.\n\nAfter years of watching the likes of Jack Rodwell and others stealing a living from the club, and giving nothing for the badge, let alone everything, this is such a refreshing change. And that is why the fact that the club has only recruited three new players in January should not be a concern.\n\nThe recruitment team have set out their stall. If you want to play for Sunderland, the first question is ‘Are you talented enough?’ If the answer to that is ‘Yes’, the next question is ‘Are you the right type of player, do you have the right mentality?’\n\nRecruiting players who can answer ‘Yes’ to those questions is precisely why we can now spend the last third of the season worrying about how high this squad might finish in the Premier League, rather than whether we will still be in it in August.\n\nLook around at other sides who have prioritised ability over attitude, who have put together a group of players, rather than a team. It is the same approach that allowed Leicester City to achieve the improbable, if not the impossible, by winning the Premier League a decade ago.\n\nThis is a team — the only team unbeaten at home in the Premier League — which is perfectly capable of continuing to take an average of 1.5 points per game for the rest of the season. Who knows where that might take us?",

    "description": "Jax Clark and Bryce Mella were among American Fork’s standouts in their rematch against Lone Peak on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "One of the state’s biggest rivalries, American Fork and Lone Peak, tipped off Tuesday night. Just as it did a few weeks ago, American Fork got the last laugh.\n\nIt was close at times, but the Cavemen never trailed and earned a convincing 58-48 road win.\n\nThe defense was huge for American Fork in the first half. It forced six turnovers in the opening quarter. The Cavemen forced Lone Peak to take the shots they wanted, which resulted in only 20 points at halftime.\n\nMeanwhile, American Fork’s Jax Clark and Bryce Mella worked to get the Cavemen high-quality shots at the rim. It wasn’t until late in the second quarter that American Fork finally got a 3-pointer from Bridger Burnside. That wasn’t because they couldn’t shoot, but largely because they were getting shot in the paint.\n\nClark ended with a team-high 15 points while Mella added 11.\n\n“I think one thing we’ve really worked hard on in practice is keeping a guy in front of us and trying to defend without fouling, that’s a big deal for us,” said American Fork head coach Ryan Cuff. “When we do get fouls called on us, it’s just because we get caught up trying to reach and things like that. So it’s just making our opponent take tough shots, and that’s another thing that we’ve worked really hard on in practice.”\n\nWhile American Fork never trailed in the win, Lone Peak gave it a scare in the fourth quarter. The Knights’ Crew Fotheringham and Skyler Andreoli made some shots down low to bring it within six points.\n\nWith no hesitation, American Fork kept going to Dieter Tuitavuki in the corner. That proved successful as Tuitavuki connected on two shots from distance to put Lone Peak away. He ended the night with an efficient 14 points off the bench, including four 3-pointers.\n\n“That kid is ready all the time when called upon,” Cuff said. “We’ve had him play some JV just to continue to give him some confidence. He’s just a sophomore, but to come in a big game like that and just being game-ready, those are shots that we expect anybody to pop if they’re open and he has that green light and he knows it. We’re just proud of him.”\n\nThe win was a big deal in terms of Region 3 standings for American Fork. The Cavemen keep sole control of the region and could guarantee an outright region title with a win over Corner Canyon on Friday.\n\n“We still have a big road in front of us, and we recognize that and recognize how much harder we have to work and come together,” Cuff said. “A hostile environment, it’s what we needed right now. Proud of them for just keeping their composure and being able to finish strong.”",

    "fullText": "Eyewitness News has learned the murder of former NFL player Kevin Johnson may be connected to three separate murders of homeless people living in encampments along the L.A. River near Willowbrook, sometimes called Compton Creek.\n\nAll four homicides occurred in the same general location in the 1300 block of East 120th Street between October 2025 and January 2026. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department noted that all four victims were unhoused individuals who were living in encampments in the area.\n\nJohnson's body was found at a homeless encampment next to Compton Creek on Jan. 21. His cause of death was listed as \"blunt head trauma\" and \"stab wounds,\" and the manner of death was ruled a homicide, according to L.A. County Medical Examiner records.\n\nORIGINAL REPORT: Former NFL player Kevin Johnson stabbed to death at LA homeless encampment\n\nFormer NFL player Kevin Johnson was found dead at a homeless encampment in the Los Angeles area. The manner of death was ruled a homicide.\n\nAccording to sources close to the investigation, the string of murders in the Compton Creek area began on Oct. 5, 2025, when a woman, identified as 52-year-old Michelle Steele, was shot in the head. She died in the hospital on Nov. 12, 2025.\n\nThree weeks later, on Dec. 4, a homeless man identified as 52-year-old Octavio Arias was murdered in the same area. According to L.A. County Medical Examiner records, Arias died from head and neck trauma.\n\nThe fourth victim, following the murder of Kevin Johnson, was identified as Mauro Alfaro, also in his 50s. According to sources, Alfaro was killed on Jan. 26, and the cause of death was blunt force trauma.\n\nThe L.A. County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau says investigators are now looking into the possibility that all four murders were done by the same killer. A suspect has not been identified.\n\nDetectives are still trying to determine motives in the killings and trying to figure out if the suspect is someone who is upset with homeless people being in that area, or if drugs or gangs may be involved. Sources say there is no concrete evidence linking the cases together.\n\nEight detectives are working the case, and say they are having a hard time getting information from the homeless population in the area. County workers have been conducting outreach in the area, trying to get the homeless population to move out into other housing.\n\nAnyone with information should call homicide detectives at 323-890-5500 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS(8477).\n\nJohnson, a native of L.A., played for the Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders from 1995 to 1997.\n\nAfter his career in the NFL ended, he played in the Arena Football League with the Orlando Predators and L.A. Avengers.",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how the New England Patriots managed to make such a remarkable turnaround this season to make the Super Bowl, and if it signals the rise of their 'evil empire'.",
    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "fullText": "Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United has once again been subject to major speculation, particularly after certain details of his contract were revealed.\n\nThe 31-year-old’s contract with Man Utd runs until 2027, meaning the club only has this summer to pocket a massive transfer fee if their talisman is to leave.\n\nFernandes has been heavily linked with a move to Saudi Arabia, where interested clubs were willing to part ways with a staggering £100 million to lure him across the desert.\n\nThat didn’t materialise, but they could get another chance to snap him up at slightly more than half their initial valuation of the Portuguese international midfielder.\n\nAccording to Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Fernandes has a stunning £57m release clause in his contract, but it can only be triggered by clubs outside the Premier League.\n\nThere’s no doubt that this would be a massive blow for United if Fernandes leaves the club this summer, particularly for a fee that doesn’t fully reflect his status at Old Trafford.\n\nFernandes has been a cornerstone of United’s midfield since joining from Sporting CP in January 2020.\n\nThe Portuguese midfielder will go down as one of the most iconic winter additions after establishing himself as the creative engine of the team.\n\nFernandes was handed the captain’s armband in 2023 by then-manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nMore than 300 appearances later, his durability and work rate remain remarkable. Fernandes has scored 103 goals and provided 99 assists in a United shirt over the past six years.\n\nThis season, he has already bagged five goals and 12 assists in the Premier League. He also has one assist in a massively disappointing FA Cup campaign.\n\nIn a side that is still struggling to find the consistency that re-establishes them firmly in the upper echelons of English football, Fernandes is still one of the few reliable performers.\n\nDespite his importance, the Portuguese midfielder has repeatedly been heavily linked with a move away and reportedly came close to leaving the club in the summer of 2025.\n\nFernandes claimed some members of United’s top brass wanted him out of the club after receiving a mouth-watering sum from Saudi Pro League (SPL) powerhouse Al Hilal.\n\n“The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head,” he said. “I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club.\n\n“From the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot.\n\n“More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all.”\n\nFernandes added to his tally in the most recent 3-2 victory against Fulham, setting up Casemiro for the opener before assisting Benjamin Sesko for the last-minute winner.\n\nThat brace of assists took him up to 12 for the season. He’s on course to beat David Beckham’s record for most assists in a Premier League season by a United player, which has stood for 26 years (15 in 1999/00).\n\nIf he maintains his current form, he could also match Kevin De Bruyne and Thierry Henry’s joint record for most assists in a Premier League season (20).\n\nFernandes has proven his worth time and again, but he could finally leave the club this summer after the exit clause in his contract was made public.\n\nThere are rumours that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) is plotting another raid on Europe’s top five leagues, and Fernandes could be one of those to move across the desert.\n\nIf that happens, it’ll undoubtedly be a massive blow for United, particularly if they fail to bring in a player who can fill the void Fernandes’ exit would leave.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Clippers made a stunning move ahead of Thursday's trade deadline, sending James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Darius Garland and a second-round pick in what ESPN's Shams Charania is calling one of the biggest swaps in recent deadline history.\n\nThe trade comes as a surprise considering the Clippers (23-26) had gone 17-4 since Dec. 20 and appeared to be rounding into form, with Harden playing a huge part in that impressive turnaround by carrying the team through injuries early in the season and keeping them afloat when it mattered the most.\n\nHe's been averaging 25.4 points and 8.1 assists per game while helping the team climb back into the Western Conference playoff picture, and the Cavaliers (30-21) are now hoping the move will boost their title chances after falling off from last season's 64-win campaign.\n\nFor Los Angeles, the math here is pretty simple: Harden is 36 years old and was looking for a new deal, while Garland is a 26-year-old two-time All-Star who gives them something they desperately needed in a future.\n\nBREAKING: The Los Angeles Clippers are trading James Harden to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Darius Garland and a second-round pick, sources tell ESPN. Prolific swap of the star point guards. pic.twitter.com/IHhhhabJnX\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 4, 2026\n\nThe Clippers entered this season with the NBA's oldest roster and no control over their next four first-round picks, so their championship window with this core had likely closed and getting younger became a priority.\n\nGarland averaged 20.6 points and 6.7 assists last season while shooting 40% from three, and he's under contract through 2027-28.\n\nESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported that Harden had recently spoken about feeling \"blessed\" to play in his hometown of Los Angeles, but she noted this was a business decision for all involved and that everyone knew how tradeable the partial guarantee on the second year of Harden's contract made him.\n\nThe structure of his deal gave him veto power over any trade, but he worked with the team to find a landing spot that suited both sides.\n\nGarland has dealt with toe injuries that limited him to just 26 games this season, and there are concerns about his durability going forward since he hasn't played since Jan. 14 due to a Grade 1 sprain of his right big toe.\n\nGarland last 15 games before getting hurt\n20/2/7.3 on 52/42/85 shooting , and less than 3 turnovers in 31MPG\n\nAbility isn’t the issue. He’s a demon with the ball.\n\n— Mark Thompson (@mathomp_501) February 4, 2026\n\nStill, when healthy, he's shown he can be one of the better point guards in the league.\n\nHead coach Tyronn Lue was asked about the situation before Monday's loss to Philadelphia and said Harden \"means a lot\" to the franchise, adding when asked if he hoped Harden would remain past the deadline: \"Who wouldn't want to have James Harden?\"\n\nThe timing creates an interesting wrinkle since Cleveland coincidentally plays the Clippers on Wednesday night at Intuit Dome, and Garland traveled with the team to Los Angeles knowing both players will need to pass physicals before the trade becomes official.\n\nDarius Garland as a Cav:\n\n— 18.8 PPG\n— 6.7 APG\n— 1.1 SPG\n— 2x All-Star\n\nTop 3 in franchise history in assists and threes. pic.twitter.com/htVc3yAGxi\n\n— StatMuse (@statmuse) February 4, 2026\n\nFor Los Angeles, this move signals a shift in direction, and instead of going all-in with an aging roster, they're betting on Garland to help them compete now while also being part of the next chapter of the franchise.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City host Newcastle United at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday while they aim to defend a 2–0 aggregate lead and reach their 10th EFL Cup final.\n\nThe Citizens have moved into a commanding position in this tie thanks to goals from Antoine Semenyo and Rayan Cherki in the first leg. While the squad has been hit by a string of defensive injuries, manager Pep Guardiola will be confident in his side’s historical dominance at home against the Magpies. A result tonight would also see them move past a frustrating domestic weekend and focus on a potential trip to Wembley. Notably, only one team in history has ever overturned a two-goal first-leg deficit to reach the final.\n\nPep Guardiola manages a squad dealing with several long-term absences but welcomes back key cup performers. Notably, Rayan Cherki is expected to start despite picking up a knock over the weekend; he aims to become the first City player since Yaya Touré to score in four consecutive EFL Cup games. However, Marc Guéhi is cup-tied and ineligible, while Jeremy Doku and Joško Gvardiol remain sidelined. Consequently, Guardiola is likely to rely on the experience of Nathan Aké and Rodri to stabilise the side.\n\nJames Trafford is poised to start in goal, protected by a backline that should include Abdukhodir Khusanov and Matheus Nunes. In midfield, the emerging Nico O’Reilly could partner Rodri, allowing Bernardo Silva to operate in a more advanced role. Erling Haaland is expected to lead the attack, supported by Semenyo and Cherki, as City look to end their recent second-half slumps.\n\nManchester City predicted XI: Trafford; Nunes, Khusanov, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Bernardo; Semenyo, Haaland\n\nThe Carabao Cup semi-final fixture takes place at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, 4 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event.

    "fullText": "Manchester City welcome Newcastle United to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night for the decisive second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, holding a commanding 2–0 aggregate lead.\n\nStrikes from Antoine Semenyo and Rayan Cherki at St James’ Park three weeks ago have put the Citizens in the driving seat to reach their 10th EFL Cup final. However, Pep Guardiola’s men arrive with questions to answer following a frustrating weekend draw at Tottenham, where they surrendered a two-goal half-time lead.\n\nFor the defending champions, Newcastle, the task is monumental; they must become only the second team in the competition’s history to overturn a two-goal first-leg deficit to reach the final. While Eddie Howe remains defiant, his squad is weathering a storm of injuries and a dip in away form that saw them fall 4–1 at Liverpool last weekend.\n\nDate: Wednesday, 4 February 2026\n\nVenue: Etihad Stadium, Manchester\n\nLast Meeting: Newcastle United 0–2 Manchester City (13 Jan 2026) League Cup\n\nPep Guardiola is monitoring the fitness of playmaker Rayan Cherki, who sustained a knock against Spurs but is expected to feature. While Rúben Dias has returned to first-team training, he is not yet match-fit. The Citizens remain without Jeremy Doku (calf), Joško Gvardiol (tibial fracture), John Stones (thigh), and Savinho. January signing Marc Guéhi is ineligible for this fixture. James Trafford is expected to start in goal.\n\nEddie Howe confirmed that captain Bruno Guimarães and young midfielder Lewis Miley are both expected to miss the trip to Manchester. They join a lengthy absentee list including Joelinton (groin), Tino Livramento (hamstring), Fabian Schär (ankle), and Emil Krafth (knee). However, Sven Botman is fit and available for selection. Sandro Tonali is likely to lead a depleted three-man midfield.\n\nThe Citizens have made the Etihad a fortress, and they enter this tie having won 17 of their last 18 home games against Newcastle across all competitions. Notably, City have struggled to maintain leads recently; in 2026, they have conceded six second-half goals in the Premier League without scoring once themselves. Despite this, Rayan Cherki remains in peak cup form, having scored in all three of his EFL Cup appearances this term.\n\nThe Magpies’ 10-game winning run in the EFL Cup, dating back to 2024, was ended by City in the first leg.

    "fullText": "Newcastle United travel to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, aiming to secure a historic comeback and keep their Carabao Cup title defence alive.\n\nThe Magpies face a defining challenge tonight as they attempt to overturn a 2–0 aggregate deficit against Manchester City. Eddie Howe demands his side replicate the spirit that delivered the trophy last year. However, they must achieve this feat at a venue where they historically struggle. Having seen their 10-game cup winning streak snapped by City in the first leg, the visitors now battle to avoid becoming only the third holders to exit at the semi-final stage.\n\nEddie Howe navigates a severe injury crisis across the pitch. Significantly, captain Bruno Guimarães misses out after failing to recover from an ankle knock. He joins Joelinton and Tino Livramento in the treatment room. Consequently, Sandro Tonali and Jacob Ramsey must shoulder the midfield burden.\n\nOn a positive note, Sven Botman passes his fitness test to lead the defence. Nick Pope retains his place in goal, protected by a backline featuring Malick Thiaw and Dan Burn. Furthermore, Joe Willock steps into the engine room to replace Guimarães. In attack, Anthony Gordon remains vital on the wing alongside Harvey Barnes. Yoane Wissa is expected to lead the line as the Magpies target early goals to unsettle a City defence that has displayed vulnerability in 2026.\n\nNewcastle predicted XI: Pope; Trippier, Thiaw, Burn, Hall; Willock, Tonali, Ramsey; Barnes, Wissa, Gordon\n\nThe Carabao Cup semi-final fixture takes place at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, 4 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 20:00 GMT.\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event. Coverage begins at 19:00 GMT on both television and the Sky Go app.\n\nRead more- The most expensive Premier League deals in the January transfer window\n\nSee Also- Declan Rice: Arsenal have ‘desire and fire’ to finally win trophies\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid manager Alvaro Arbeloa has had a rollercoaster start to his tenure at the Bernabeu as senior manager, and internally that has been the case too. Exiting the Copa del Rey at the hands of Albacete in his first game, and dropping out of the top eight in the Champions League, Arbeloa has managed to cut the gap to Barcelona in La Liga down to one point.\n\nEarlier this week it was reported that Arbeloa has improved the atmosphere in the dressing room, and the tension that was present during Xabi Alonso’s spell has died down. Cadena SER say the club believe that their decision to change manager was worthwhile. Arbeloa has made a point of getting close to his players, and some even believe that he has gone over the top with that objective.\n\nHowever some of his decisions have surprised the Real Madrid dressing room. During their 4-2 defeat to Benfica, some of the players were surprised that Dani Ceballos did not make it off the bench, while Castilla talent Jorge Cestero was sent on for the final stages. Said players ‘let Arbeloa know about it’, and it is possible he was keen to placate them, with Ceballos coming on at half-time against Rayo Vallecano.\n\nTheir information continues on to say that Arbeloa has not installed any radical tactical changes, with the Real Madrid squad expecting more from him. Arbeloa was delayed in giving his press conference on Sunday after a 2-1 win over Rayo Vallecano, and this was due to a long and tense discussion between Arbeloa and the players, who did not see eye-to-eye with some of his substitutions and tactical choices.\n\nAs such, the feeling from the dressing room is that they are being trained by the Castilla manager rather than the long-term solution for the bench at the Bernabeu. Arbeloa is seen as an interim option, who could be moved on in the summer.\n\nArbeloa and returning fitness coach Antonio Pintus are now approaching a critical period of two midweeks without games, which will be their best opportunity to implement any changes on the training ground. Without notable improvement, Arbeloa’s position will only weaken as the weeks pass.",

    "fullText": "Known Chelsea fan Paul Merson says he is numb after watching the approach and setup by Chelsea in the defeat to Arsenal last night.\n\nHead coach Liam Rosenior has been criticised for going too defensive against Arsenal despite being 3-2 down from the first leg. Chelsea ended up losing the game 1-0 on the night, and 4-2 on aggregate over both legs.\n\nOther than Joao Pedro up top, who earned praise from Gary Neville, and a couple of others, Chelsea were just not really up to the task last night.\n\nRosenior went with a back three formation from the off, using a compact setup that featured no wingers in it from the off. It was a setup designed for stability and to contain, trying to stop Arsenal from scoring another goal and becoming more impossible to catch. But the issue was, it was Chelsea who needed a goal to keep the tie alive, and Arsenal were happy to just contain themselves. It made it an edge and pretty uneventful game to watch really.\n\nMerson is a passionate Blues fan, so it’s always good to see what he has to say after games.\n\nCole Palmer’s free kick hits the wall. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images)\n\n“I’m numb. I’m flabbergasted,” said Merson. “I can’t believe what I just watched.\n\nI honestly can’t believe what I just watched. This is Chelsea Football Club. They’ve got international football players. They’ve got a World Cup winner [Enzo Fernandez]. They’ve got players all over.\n\n“This is not a bottom four, bottom five team. He [Wesley Fofana] is crying. He should be crying because they never had a go.\n\n“I’m lost for words. I cannot believe what happened. They’ve just gone out with an absolute whimper, in the semi-final of a big competition. If it worked it was great, but it hasn’t worked and you can’t gamble like that.\n\n“Have a go and go out in a blaze of glory. Don’t go out like that. I’m lost for words. Honestly, I’m lost for words.”\n\nMerson’s fellow Sky pundit Jamie Redknapp said: “In semi-finals, it’s just a completely different thing altogether. You’ve got to throw caution to the wind.\n\n“You’ve got to get the ball into the box. You’ve got to be thinking, no regrets after this game. There will be a lot of regrets in that dressing room, thinking we didn’t do enough.”\n\nQuotes via The Evening Standard.",

Pep Guardiola’s side will be eager to book their place in the Carabao Cup final tonight, where Arsenal await the winner of tonight’s semi-final tie.\n\nHere is the latest Manchester City injury and team news and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of tonight’s massive match.\n\nManchester City enter tonight’s match with several players unavailable due to injury. Josko Gvardiol, John Stones, Mateo Kovacic, Jeremy Doku and Savinho are all ruled out of tonight’s match due to injury. Ruben Dias has returned to training this week, but he may not be ready to start tonight’s match after a long injury layoff.\n\nPep Guardiola told the media yesterday that Rayan Cherki’s fitness is being monitored ahead of tonight’s match. The French international picked up a knock after a heavy challenge from Cristian Romero during the first half of Manchester City’s 2-2 draw with Tottenham last Sunday.\n\nMarc Guehi is ineligible to play in tonight’s match. If City progress to the Carabao Cup final tonight, Guehi will also be ineligible to play in the final.

    "description": "Harden clears the air on his exit from Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "James Harden is a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers. A few hours after news of the trade became public, he spoke with ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne. In that conversation, he said that he didn’t ask for a trade from the Los Angeles Clippers and that he’s “excited about Cleveland.”\n\nJust spoke to a reflective James Harden, who denied asking for a trade and thanked the Clippers for the opportunity to play the last two and a half years in his hometown. “In life, not even just basketball, when things don't work out, there are ways to end things in relationships…\n\n— Ramona Shelburne (@ramonashelburne) February 4, 2026\n\nHarden on his exit from Los Angeles:\n\n“In life, not even just basketball, when things don’t work out, there are ways to end things in relationships without having to crack each other. Okay, maybe we just don’t see a future with each other. Maybe we just outgrew each other, whatever the case may be. I feel like other situations weren’t like that. And that’s why I can respect Steve and L and TLu because they didn’t put me in a weird position as much as everybody tried to make it like that.”\n\n“[I] didn’t want to feel like I was holding the Clippers up in their future. I wanted them to actually have a chance to rebuild and get some draft capital. In Cleveland I see an opportunity to win in the East— they got a very good team, coaching staff, all of the above. So as much as I wanted to stay in LA and give it a go—I’ve never won one before. As a basketball mind I think we have a bit better chance.”\n\nHarden concluded the conversation with:\n\n“At the end of the day it is a business and I think both sides got what they wanted, are in a great place and are very happy. I’m excited about Cleveland —I’m still trying to chase my first championship and do whatever it takes to win.”\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Harden and Donovan Mitchell have already “connected” and are “very excited” for the partnership.\n\nJoining @SportsCenter @ Night on how 11-time All-Star James Harden lands in Cleveland to partner with Donovan Mitchell on a title pursuit: pic.twitter.com/dTMUEJtUFE\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 4, 2026\n\nIt’s good to get Harden’s perspective on some of this immediately after the trade. Even though the Clippers were playing well lately, it was difficult to see them as true title contenders. His exit, at least based on his statement, would suggest that the move wasn’t motivated just by money, but a desire to compete.\n\nHarden also made clear that he thinks he can win with the Cavs. The Eastern Conference is wide open. And this might be Harden’s last, best chance to win a championship. We’ll see if he — and the Cavs — can make the most of this opportunity.",

    "description": "FC Bayern is winning as a team.",
    "fullText": "Individual awards like the Ballon d’Or are often framed as personal milestones, but Joshua Kimmich’s comments on Harry Kane reveal why that conversation looks different inside Bayern Munich. For all of Kane’s goals, records, and global reputation, his greatest strength may be how little he appears to chase individual recognition.\n\n“The goal is to achieve things as a team to make it possible for him to win individual awards. But generally speaking, when he’s on the pitch, I don’t get the impression that he’s playing for individual awards, he’s a very complete player and plays for the team’s success,” Kimmich said (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “I’ve never seen him sad in the dressing room because we won 3-0 and he didn’t score. He’s also someone who wants to put his teammates in the spotlight. This mix makes him very special and extremely valuable to us.”\n\nThat perspective cuts to the heart of Kane’s impact at Bayern Munich. He is the focal point of the attack, yet rarely behaves like one. Goals matter — and he delivers them relentlessly — but they are never pursued at the expense of structure, rhythm, or teammates. Kane drops deep, links play, creates space, and celebrates others’ success with the same enthusiasm as his own.\n\nIn a squad full of winners, that mentality carries real weight. Bayern’s dressing room is built on collective accountability, not stat-padding, and Kane fits that ethos naturally. His leadership is subtle but powerful: calm reactions, selflessness in big moments, and an obvious commitment to the group.\n\nIf Kane does eventually lift the Ballon d’Or, it likely won’t be because he chased it. As Kimmich makes clear, it will be because Bayern succeeded together — and because Kane embodies exactly the kind of player individual awards are supposed to honor.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — The USC Trojans played yet another tightrope game against a Big Ten opponent, but this time managed to end on a positive note.\n\nHead coach Eric Musselman and his squad welcomed the 15-7 Indiana Hoosiers into the Galen Center Tuesday night and managed to escape with an 81-75 victory.\n\nShots were falling left and right for the Trojans' offense to begin the con, as they managed to make their first seven shot attempts and shut down the Hoosiers attempt to get anything going with stellar defense in the paint within the first 10 minutes of regulation.\n\nFreshman Alijah Arenas rejoined the team on January 21 against the Northwestern Wildcats and, since then, has been on a steady upclimb to knock off the rust of sitting out for the last couple of months.\n\nHe started off the first half as Southern California's leader in points (10) on some lopsided shooting attempts (3-13).\n\nNonetheless, his performance against the Hoosiers would be a step in the right direction as he notched a career high of 29 points on 9-23 shooting from the floor and five rebounds.\n\nFollowing the win, coach Musselman said he doesn't regret starting Arenas in his first game back when USC played Northwestern some weeks ago and forgoed settling him in traditionally, knowing he would only need just a handful of games to get his groove back.\n\nMusselman called Arenas' performance \"pretty damn impressive,\" considering that the 18-year-old has just a handful of games at the collegiate level under his belt.\n\nArenas credited his team for his upbringing at the college level, and also gave his flowers to Kam Woods, whom Arenas credits for his shooting performance as of late.\n\n\"Without my team, I kind of start losing myself, which is why I am grateful to have them,\" Arenas said.\n\nWoods also had a great night on the floor, shooting 6-12 from the floor and notching 18 points, along with six rebounds to his credit.\n\nWoods and Arenas had to pick up the majority of the offensive baggage as leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara went down with an ankle injury in the second half and had to be helped off the court.\n\nHe would later reappear with crutches and an ice pack on his knee as he sat down on the sidelines.\n\nMusselman gave no concrete update on the condition of Chad Baker-Mazara's injury, but assumes he has a sprained MCL, and won't know until Baker-Mazara gets an MRI soon.\n\nChad Baker-Mazara is back on the sidelines with crutches after being helped off the court earlier in the second half.\n\nHis night is presumably done. pic.twitter.com/KeXKMxhsUz\n\n— Adrian Medina (@AdrianMedina_16) February 4, 2026\n\nDespite the loss of Baker-Mazara, the Trojans were able to keep the Hoosiers' field goal percentage a tick above 40 percent, and a clutch block by Ryan Cornish during Indiana's final shot attempt was the final nail in the coffin, as USC came away with their sixth conference win.\n\nThe Trojans have some time before their next contest, as they head out to play the Penn State Cougars on Super Bowl Sunday.",

    "fullText": "On the night leading up to Wednesday, the transfer chaos surrounding N'Golo Kanté was complete. The French world champion is now indeed moving to Fenerbahçe. \"Giving up is not an option for us,\" the club initially tweeted before the transfer was officially announced two hours later.\n\nAfter the Turkish club had announced at noon that the deal had failed (you can read it again here), the transfer chaos is now complete. However, since the transfer window in Turkey is open longer, the transfer can still go through.\n\nKanté signs a contract until 2028 and is part of a swap deal. In return, Youssef En-Nesyri moves to Kanté's former club Al Ittihad. According to media reports, the Saudis are paying 15 million euros, and Kanté is moving to Istanbul on a free transfer.\n\nThe Frenchman is said to have previously refused to participate in training at Al Ittihad to force his transfer. He has now succeeded in doing so.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence. You can read the original version in 🇩🇪 here.\n\n📸 Franco Arland - 2025 Getty Images",

    "fullText": "Telling ChatGPT not to do something can make it actively suggest doing it, with some models even willing to endorse theft or deception when the prompt includes the forbidden act.\n\nLike me, you may have come across a strange phenomenon with Large Language Models (LLMs) whereby they don’t just ignore a specific instruction you gave, which included a prohibition (i.e., ‘Don’t do [something]’), but seem to go out of their way to immediately enact the very thing you just told them not to enact – even if doing so is ‘out of character’ for the model.\n\nThis is a known feature even of older NLP models; and a growing strand of research regarding LLMs’ negation capabilities has emerged in recent years.\n\nThough it can be challenging for people to chase down the buried meaning in a complex double-negative*, LLMs have an added disadvantage, illustrated in the below example of ChatGPT’s monotonicity reasoning, from a 2023 paper:\n\nThough the internal workings of a closed model such as ChatGPT are opaque, the second answer appears to be repurposing the logic used to generate the first answer; however, that logic is not applicable in the second case, because the man may own an animal other than a dog†.\n\nHere, therefore, the outcome of the second inquiry appears to have been affected by the context of the solution obtained for the first.\n\nLikewise, by suggesting the existence of a prohibited act, that banned act can often be put into action by an LLM, which acknowledges and processes the act, but not the negation.\n\nThis is a severe restriction on the utility of LLMs, because in domains where language models may be used for critical applications, such as medicine, finance, or security, it is clearly important that they correctly interpret orders that contain prohibitions.\n\nThis problem is highlighted in a new paper from the US, which examines the extent to which commercial models (such as ChatGPT) and open-source models (such as LLaMA) are unable to follow negative instructions.\n\nThe researchers tested 16 models over 14 ethical scenarios, and concluded that open-source models endorse (i.e., encourage, enact, enable) specifically banned instructions 77% of the time under simple negation (‘Don’t do this), and 100% of the time under complex negation (‘Don’t do this if it leads to that’).\n\nWhile commercial models fared better, only Gemini-3-Flash achieved the top rating in a new Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) scale proposed by the paper (though Grok 4.1 ran a close second).\n\nUnder the new benchmark, all the models tested would be banned from making decisions in the domains medical, financial, legal, military, business, education, and science – effectively rendering them unusable in such contexts. Though reasoning models generally performed better, even these slower approaches failed under queries with compound negation.\n\nGiven the longstanding association between computing and reliable Boolean operators such as OR and NOT, users who view binary consistency as a baseline expectation may be particularly exposed to failures of this kind.\n\nCommenting on the difficulty that open-source LLMs have in parsing negated queries, the authors state:\n\n‘Commercial models fare better but still show swings of 19-128%. Agreement between models drops from 74% on affirmative prompts to 62% on negated ones, and financial scenarios prove twice as fragile as medical ones […]\n\n‘The findings point to a gap between what current alignment techniques achieve and what safe deployment requires: models that cannot reliably distinguish “do X” from “do not X” should not be making autonomous decisions in high-stakes contexts.’\n\nThe paper notes that failures of this kind are more likely to impact vulnerable individuals across the studied domains:\n\n‘Domain adjustment is not merely technical calibration. Rather, it has equity implications.\n\n‘Financial fragility means that economically vulnerable populations, for example those seeking loans, benefits, or credit, face higher exposure to negation errors than those seeking medical information.’\n\nFurther, the authors emphasize that the problem cannot be resolved through traditional alignment-based approaches, since the issue involves a deep-rooted failure of intent parsing in LLMs, rather than a corporate requirement to restrict what they say, or how they interpret a prompt:\n\n‘A model can be “aligned” in the sense of refusing harmful keywords while failing to process the structure of requests. True alignment requires not just learning what to value but correctly parsing the linguistic expressions of those values.\n\n‘Until that capability is reliable, “do not” should mean “do not.”‘\n\nInterestingly, though Gemini Flash was the sole ‘winner’ in the authors’ own novel benchmark, the current crop of Chinese LLMs generally proved to be far less susceptible to the problem.\n\nThe new paper is titled When Prohibitions Become Permissions: Auditing Negation Sensitivity in Language Models, and comes from two researchers at Kenyon College in Ohio.\n\nThe 14 ethical scenarios developed by the researchers to test the LLMs were:\n\nContents in the ‘ACTION AT STAKE’ column above are not intended as ethically ‘correct answers’, but as the only available do / don’t do actions for each scenario; here the LLMs are not being challenged on their ethical standards, but rather on their ability to parse complex queries and prohibitions in critical situations.\n\nTherefore the severity of these scenarios is only illustrative, on the part of the authors; the LLMs could as effectively have been interrogated on much less severe topics.\n\nThe US commercial models tested for the work were GPT-5.1; GPT-5.2; GPT-5-mini; Claude-Haiku-4.5; Claude-Sonnet-4.5; Gemini-3-Flash; Grok-4.1-non-reasoning; and Grok-4.1-reasoning.\n\nThe Chinese commercial models tested were DeepSeek-V3; GLM-4; Kimi-K2; and Qwen3.\n\nThe open-source models used were LLaMA-3.2-1B; Gemma-3-4B; Granite-3.3-2B; and Phi-4-mini-3.8B.\n\nPrompts for each of the 14 scenarios were written in four versions: F0 stated that the action should be done; F1, that it should not; F2 supported pursuing a goal even if it required the (prohibited) action; and F3 rejected the goal if it required the (prohibited) action:\n\n‘Under F0, models are asked whether he “should rob the store.” Under F1, whether he “should not rob the store.” Under F2, whether he should “save his daughter even if it means he must rob the store.”\n\n‘Under F3, whether he should “not save his daughter if it means he must rob the store.” The admissible facts remain constant, and only polarity varies.’\n\nThe approach argues that if a model understands how negation works, its answers should ‘flip cleanly’ between positive and negative versions of the same prompt. Therefore, if 60% of responses agree that ‘they should do X’ (F0), then only 40% should agree that ‘they should not do X’ (F1) – since rejecting F1 also means supporting the action; and when the numbers don’t match up in this way, the model is misreading negation.\n\nThe authors used Cochran’s Q test and the Kruskal-Wallis H-test to measure how much framing (variation in prompt polarity while preserving meaning) affected model responses, both within and across categories. After adjusting for false positives, the authors found that in 61.9% of cases, the model’s answer changed significantly depending only on how the prompt was phrased – even when the core meaning stayed the same.\n\nThey also tested whether reducing randomness (‘temperature’) made models less fragile††:\n\nUnder simple affirmative prompts (F0), models from all three categories gave moderate support for the proposed actions, with endorsement rates between 24% and 37%. This was expected, given that the scenarios were designed as moral dilemmas without obvious right answers. However, the authors note that the balance broke down under negation:\n\n‘Open-source models jump from 24% endorsement under F0 to 77% under F1. When told “should not do X,” they endorse doing X more than three times out of four. Under compound negation (F3), they reach 100% endorsement, a ceiling effect indicating complete failure to process the negation operator.’\n\nOpen-source models showed the most extreme framing effects, with endorsement rates jumping 317% from F0 to F3 – a sign that their outputs are highly sensitive to how a question is phrased. US commercial models also showed large swings, with endorsement rates more than doubling when prompts were reworded from F0 to F3.\n\nChinese commercial models were more stable overall, with only a 19% increase from F0 to F3, compared to jumps of over 100% in other groups. More importantly, they were the only models to reduce their endorsement when a prompt was negated, suggesting they understood that saying ‘should not’ means the opposite of ‘should’:\n\nModels agreed with each other 74% of the time when prompts used affirmative wording, but only 62% when the same ideas were expressed with negation – a12-point drop suggesting that models are not trained to handle negation in a consistent way:\n\nTo measure how easily a model’s judgment can be flipped by rephrasing a prompt with negation, the authors developed the aforementioned Negation Sensitivity Index (NSI) – a metric designed to quantify whether a model gives opposite answers to questions that are logically equivalent, but framed using negation.\n\nA high NSI score indicates that a model frequently reverses its position when a prompt is negated, revealing a reliance on superficial wording rather than consistent reasoning.\n\nThe NSI benchmark was created by generating pairs of prompts (one original, one with a logical negation), and observing whether the model produced semantically opposite responses. By comparing answers across a large set of such pairs, the authors defined NSI as the proportion of valid negation pairs where the model flipped its output.\n\nThe NSI benchmark was used in tests to evaluate domain sensitivity in negation (i.e., whether the context category ‘financial’ or ‘military’, etc., affected the outcome), achieving some interesting contrasts. Here, some types of decisions proved much more sensitive to wording changes than others.\n\nFor instance, business and finance prompts triggered high fragility, with models flipping answers when a question was rephrased or negated, scoring around 0.64 to 0.65 on the NSI scale. Medical prompts were more stable, averaging just 0.34:\n\nNoting that the medical domain produced the fewest errors and financial the highest, the authors hypothesize:\n\n‘Why might this gap exist? It is possible that medical decisions may benefit from clearer training signal. Hippocratic principles, established protocols, and extensive professional literature may anchor model behavior even under framing variation.\n\n‘Financial decisions, on the other hand, involve murkier tradeoffs with less social consensus, leaving models more susceptible to surface cues.’\n\nThe problem was most severe in open-source models, which reached NSI scores above 0.89 in finance, business, and military prompts. Commercial systems were less fragile but still showed high sensitivity, scoring between 0.20 and 0.75 depending on the domain:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the authors note that the heightened fragility of open-source models in this area may carry disproportionate risks for vulnerable or marginalized groups, who are more likely to be served by locally deployed systems chosen for budgetary reasons in municipal or governmental settings†††:\n\n‘If an institution deploys an open-source model for cost reasons, the burden falls disproportionately on populations already navigating precarious financial circumstances. Buolamwini and Gebru documented how accuracy disparities in facial recognition fell along demographic lines.\n\n‘Our findings suggest a parallel disparity along domain lines, with economically vulnerable populations bearing greater risk.’\n\nThough we do not have scope here to cover the entirety of the paper’s results, and its closing case studies, it is noteworthy that the case studies demonstrate a proclivity for negation-blind model responses to end up recommending extremely non-advisable courses of action, simply because they misinterpreted the negation construction:\n\n‘Under F0, open-source models endorse robbery 52% of the time, a defensible split given the scenario’s moral complexity. Under F1 (“should NOT rob”), they endorse it 100%. The negated prohibition produces unanimous endorsement of the prohibited action.\n\n‘Commercial models show a more mixed pattern, with aggregate endorsement rising from 33% to 70% under simple negation. Some commercial systems show near-inversion, while others show modest increases.\n\n‘Significantly, no category achieves the mirror-image reversal that correct negation processing would produce.’\n\nThis is one of the most interesting papers I have come across in a while, and I recommend the reader to investigate further, as there is not space here to cover all of the material presented by the authors\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the study is how frequently a user of LLMs comes across this problem, and gradually learns not to ‘put unwanted thoughts’ in their LLMs’ cogitative processes, often attempting to exclude certain undesired results by alternative means than in-prompt negation – such as user-level system prompts, long-term memory storage, or repetitive in-prompt templates that retain the objective.\n\nIn practice, none of these methods is terribly effective, while the black-box nature of Gemini Flash – here the best-performing LLM – makes it hard to glean remedies from the obtained test results.\n\nPerhaps greater clues to the underlying architectural problem lies in studying why Chinese models, though none approach the heights of the leaderboard, generally perform so much better in this single, thorny aspect.\n\n* A form which is actually baked into several romance languages, including Italian.\n\n† Even ChatGPT-4o does not make this mistake any longer.\n\n†† The source paper contains a few misattributions of tables and figures. At one point the text indicates that table 1 (which is just a list of LLMs used in tests) contains the core results. In these cases I have had to guess what the correct figures or tables are, and I stand to be corrected by the authors.\n\n††† My substitution of hyperlinks for the authors’ inline citations.\n\nFirst published Tuesday, February 3, 2026\n\nWriter on machine learning, domain specialist in human image synthesis.

    "description": "30 years of Windows widgets - from Active Desktop to the Widget Board. Six implementations, six deaths, and the scar tissue that shapes the platform you'd build on today.",
    "fullText": "The full history of Windows widgets, from 1997 to today.\n\nEvery constraint you'll hit today exists because of a specific past disaster.\n\nMicrosoft has been trying to solve the same UX problem since 1997: how to surface live information without making you launch an app. They've shipped six different implementations across nearly 30 years. Each one died from a different fundamental flaw - performance, security, screen space, privacy, engagement. And each death triggered the same reflex: containment.\n\nThe pattern goes like this. Microsoft releases widgets into the wild. Users or attackers find the breaking point. Microsoft panics, kills the feature, and ships the next version locked inside a tighter box. Active Desktop splashed HTML across the wallpaper - performance collapsed, so Vista contained widgets in a rigid sidebar. Users hated losing screen space, so Windows 7 freed gadgets to float anywhere - then a security exploit blew the whole platform apart. Windows 8 responded by locking widgets into a full-screen Start Screen nobody wanted. The cycle repeats: build, ship, backlash, kill, rebuild with more walls.\n\nUnderstanding why each containment failed tells you exactly what constraints shape the platform you'd build on today. Every design decision in the current architecture - the declarative Adaptive Cards format, the native WinUI 3 renderer, the overlay-instead-of-dock layout - exists because of a specific past disaster. The constraints you'll hit when building widgets today aren't arbitrary. They're scar tissue.\n\nInternet Explorer 4.0 shipped in 1997 with a component called the Windows Desktop Update. It fused the Trident rendering engine into explorer.exe, turning the Windows wallpaper from a static bitmap into a live HTML surface. Microsoft called it Active Desktop.\n\nThe most visible piece was the Active Channel Bar - a vertical strip docked to the right edge of the screen, populated with branded buttons for Disney, MSNBC, Warner Bros, and CNN. Each button represented a \"Channel,\" a website that pushed content to your machine for offline reading. The backbone was Channel Definition Format (CDF), an XML standard that told your PC which pages to download and when.\n\nA small red sparkle called the \"Gleam\" appeared on a channel's icon when new content arrived. It was an early attempt at the notification patterns we now take for granted. The handpicked channel lineup drew antitrust complaints, but the real killer was more mundane.\n\nPentium I/II processors with 16–32 MB of RAM buckled under a constantly running HTML renderer. Because Trident was fused into the shell, a crash in Active Desktop crashed all of explorer.exe. Users saw a white HTML recovery screen where their wallpaper should have been. Disk I/O from background syncs ground hard drives to a halt, degrading everything else running on the machine.\n\n\"Disable Active Desktop\" became the top tuning tip for Windows 98.\n\nMicrosoft had discovered its first widget lesson: ambient information cannot cost performance.\n\nThe widget concept went dormant during the XP years, then resurfaced inside the troubled \"Longhorn\" project. The original 2002 vision was ambitious - a translucent sidebar meant to replace the system tray entirely. After Longhorn collapsed and was reset in 2004, the scope shrank. What shipped with Windows Vista in January 2007 was a supplementary pane: a dark, semi-transparent strip running the full height of the right edge of the screen.\n\nThe sidebar was a showcase for Aero Glass. The default clock gadget had a sweeping red second hand behind a reflective glass face. The CPU meter mimicked luxury car dashboard dials - metallic bezels, needles that jittered physically as load spiked, turning red as they approached 100%. Eleven gadgets shipped in total, and thousands more followed.\n\nThe problem was physical. Most monitors in 2007 were 4:3 or 5:4, and the sidebar permanently consumed around 150 pixels of horizontal space. On a 1280x1024 display, that's over 10% of your workspace. Power users disabled it on day one. The sidebar.exe process compounded the issue - it leaked memory steadily, consuming 50–100 MB on systems where 1 GB of RAM was the minimum spec.\n\nMicrosoft had attempted containment: give widgets a fixed home, keep things tidy. But rigid docking doesn't work when screen space is scarce.\n\nWindows 7 freed the gadgets. Microsoft dropped the sidebar container entirely, renamed the feature Desktop Gadgets, and let users drag widgets anywhere on screen. Gadgets snapped magnetically to screen edges and to each other. A new \"Aero Peek\" button in the taskbar made all windows transparent on hover, so you could glance at your gadgets without minimizing your work.\n\nThe third-party ecosystem exploded. DeviantArt and WinCustomize communities produced GPU temperature monitors, Winamp remote controls, elaborate calendar suites. It was the golden age of desktop customization.\n\nIt was also a security catastrophe hiding in plain sight.\n\nDesktop gadgets ran as HTML Applications with full local machine trust. No sandbox. A gadget could read files, write to the registry, and execute system commands.\n\nIn July 2012, at Black Hat in Las Vegas, researchers Mickey Shkatov and Toby Kohlenberg presented \"We Have You By The Gadgets.\" The attack chain was elegant and devastating: intercept the HTTP traffic of a weather gadget on a shared network, inject JavaScript into the XML data stream, use that JavaScript to instantiate an ActiveX control like WScript.Shell, then execute arbitrary code on the target machine. A weather widget became a backdoor.\n\n▶ Black Hat 2012: \"We Have You By The Gadgets\" - the presentation that killed Desktop Gadgets.\n\nThe researchers also demonstrated a distribution vector - since .gadget files were just renamed ZIPs, an attacker could package a trojan inside a seemingly innocent clock skin. Users would install it without triggering antivirus warnings, because the code executed within the trusted sidebar.exe process.\n\nMicrosoft's response was nuclear. By the time Windows 8 launched in October 2012, the entire gadget engine was ripped from the codebase. Freedom without a sandbox was a death sentence. Everything Microsoft built after this moment was shaped by the security lesson. The move to declarative Adaptive Cards - JSON that describes a UI, never executes code - exists because of Black Hat 2012.\n\nWindows 8 made a radical bet: tiles ARE the launcher. The Start Menu disappeared, replaced by a full-screen Start Screen - a grid of rectangular tiles that doubled as widgets. When \"live,\" a tile flipped or slid to reveal content: unread email counts, weather forecasts, news headlines.\n\nThe technology was elegant. Apps pushed tiny XML payloads through Windows Notification Services (WNS) to update their tiles without running a background process. Battery impact was near zero. Developers chose from a predefined catalog of XML templates - TileWideSmallImageAndText03 and friends - which enforced visual consistency but prevented any custom layout.\n\nThe user experience was a disaster. On a desktop PC, checking your weather tile meant leaving your work, entering the full-screen Start Screen, then navigating back. That context switch enraged productivity users. Enterprise customers called it a dealbreaker.\n\nThere was a deeper problem. Tiles were read-only. You couldn't check off a to-do, pause a song, or reply to a message from the tile. Clicking always launched the full app. Compared to the interactive gadgets of Windows 7 - where you could type notes, adjust sliders, and control media players directly on the desktop - this felt like a clear regression.\n\nWindows 10 tried a compromise - tiles went back into a traditional Start Menu. But third-party developers never invested in WNS backends. Building a live tile meant setting up a cloud service to format XML payloads and push them through Microsoft's notification infrastructure - a nontrivial cost for a feature most users barely noticed. By 2020, Start Menus were filled with static, lifeless squares. When Windows 11 launched in 2021, Live Tiles were gone.\n\nContainment attempt number two, even more extreme than Vista's sidebar. Widgets must live alongside your work, not in a separate universe.\n\nBefore the current Widget Board, Microsoft tried two half-measures.\n\nCortana Cards (2015–2020) were the most capable widgets Microsoft ever shipped. The assistant scraped your email for flight confirmations and showed gate info. It read your calendar and estimated commute times. It tracked packages automatically. It surfaced sports scores for teams you followed, restaurant suggestions based on your location, and weather forecasts tuned to your daily routine. Users managed these through a settings panel called the \"Notebook,\" where they explicitly declared their interests.\n\nAll of this required deep access to your email, location, and calendar data. Users saw a company reading their emails. Most disabled Cortana entirely.\n\nThe catch: disabling Cortana left the dashboard empty - a blank panel with nothing to show. In May 2020, Microsoft pivoted Cortana to a productivity chatbot and removed the cards.\n\nNews and Interests (April 2021) took a simpler approach - a weather icon on the Windows 10 taskbar that expanded into a news flyout on hover. The hover trigger was the problem. Users moving their mouse toward the system tray accidentally opened a panel of headlines. IT administrators scrambled to disable it via Group Policy. The feature was labeled bloatware within weeks of launch.\n\n▶ News and Interests - the accidental hover trigger that got it labeled bloatware within weeks.\n\nBoth attempts proved a consistent pattern: users want glanceable information but reject anything that feels invasive or disruptive. These two failures directly shaped what came next.\n\nWindows 11 shipped in October 2021 with a dedicated Widgets Board - a panel that slides out from the left edge of the screen when you press Win + W or click the weather icon on the taskbar. The board is an overlay, not a docked sidebar, so it claims zero permanent screen space.\n\nThe Widget Board rendered everything through Edge WebView2, the Chromium-based web control shipped as part of the Windows Web Experience Pack. Widget providers implemented the IWidgetProvider COM interface and defined their UI using Adaptive Cards - a JSON format that describes layout declaratively. No executable code, no scripts. The host parses data, never runs it. This eliminated the entire class of remote code execution attacks that killed Desktop Gadgets in 2012. But the rendering was still web-based. Users could see msedgewebview2.exe processes in Task Manager when the board opened, often consuming hundreds of megabytes of RAM.\n\nMicrosoft opened the board to third-party developers in 2023. Spotify added playback controls. Facebook Messenger shows recent conversations. Phone Link surfaces mobile notifications. Xbox Game Pass highlights new releases. Unlike Live Tiles, these widgets are interactive - you can pause a track, check a box, or reply to a message without leaving the board. For web developers, the PWA widget path is the most accessible entry point. Define widgets in your web app manifest, and they appear natively on the board. No Win32 code, no UWP packaging - your existing web stack works. That low barrier to entry is a deliberate correction from the Live Tiles era, where standing up a WNS backend cost more effort than most developers were willing to spend.\n\nThe architecture was secure - sandboxed web content can't touch your file system. But the WebView2 rendering layer, the forced MSN news feed, and the lack of user control over the board's content drew persistent criticism. Something had to change.\n\nIn mid-2024, Microsoft began rebuilding the board. The forcing function was the EU's Digital Markets Act, which required Microsoft to open the Widget Board to third-party feed providers in the European Economic Area. To comply, Microsoft separated the MSN content pipeline into a replaceable Store-updatable component - the Microsoft Start Experiences app - making it one feed provider among many rather than a hardwired default. The compliance overhaul gave Microsoft the opportunity to rebuild the rendering layer too: widget rendering moved from WebView2 to native WinUI 3.\n\nAdaptive Card JSON now maps directly to WinUI 3 XAML controls: a TextBlock in your card becomes an actual Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.TextBlock on screen. Widgets inherit Fluent Design theming, high-contrast modes, and accessibility automatically. The memory footprint dropped - a native WinUI 3 control is far lighter than a DOM element inside a Chromium instance.\n\nThe latest evolution arrived in early 2026: Lock Screen widgets. Weather, sports scores, and traffic now appear before you log in. Third-party apps can participate too. It's a full conceptual circle back to the \"glance and go\" vision that started this story in 1997 - except now the hardware can handle it, the sandbox keeps it safe, and the user stays in control. Microsoft appears to have realized that widgets shouldn't compete with applications for desktop space. They belong in the liminal moments of computing - the glance before you unlock, the pause between tasks.\n\nWith 250+ million monthly active Windows users, the potential reach for widget developers is enormous. Whether the platform delivers depends on how Microsoft navigates the tensions that killed every previous attempt.\n\nThe current Widget Board is the scar tissue made manifest. Declarative JSON with no executable code (security). Native WinUI 3 rendering, migrated off the original WebView2 pipeline (performance). An overlay, not a dock (screen space). Interactive widgets (engagement). Opt-in data access (privacy). Every lesson encoded in architecture.\n\nBut it's not perfect. The developer API has constraints that limit what you can build. The discoverability problem - most Windows users have never pressed Win + W - remains unsolved. And while the news feed is finally optional, the tension between Microsoft's desire to monetize the Discover surface and users' desire for a clean utility board is far from resolved.\n\nThose constraints, and how to work within them to ship something useful, are what the rest of this series will cover.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at President Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.\n\nA three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they \"express no view” on how he should rule.\n\nTrump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday's arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump's lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court.\n\nHellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case.\n\nThe first was after Trump’s March 2023 indictment; the second followed Trump’s May 2024 conviction and a subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that presidents and former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts.\n\nIn the later ruling, at issue in the 2nd Circuit decision, Hellerstein said Trump’s lawyers had failed to meet the high burden of proof for changing jurisdiction and that Trump’s conviction for falsifying business records involved his personal life, not official actions that the Supreme Court ruled are immune from prosecution.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit panel said Hellerstein’s ruling, which echoed his previous denial, “did not consider whether certain evidence admitted during the state court trial relates to immunized official acts or, if so, whether evidentiary immunity transformed” the hush money case into one that relates to official acts.\n\nThe three judges said Hellerstein should closely review evidence that Trump claims relate to official acts.\n\nIf Hellerstein finds the prosecution relied on evidence of official acts, the judges said, he should weigh whether Trump can argue those actions were taken as part of his White House duties, whether Trump “diligently sought” to have the case moved to federal court and whether the case can even be moved to federal court now that Trump has been convicted and sentenced in state court.\n\nTrump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, whose allegations of an affair with Trump threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. He was sentenced to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment.\n\nTrump denies Daniels’ claim and said he did nothing wrong. He has asked a state appellate court to overturn the conviction.",

    "title": "Ukraine’s strategy is to kill 50,000 Russian soldiers a month. A sign of confidence or an indicator of weakness?",
    "description": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new Defense Minister to make it a priority.",
    "fullText": "Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking up Russia’s battlefield fatalities and has asked his new defense minister to make it a priority.\n\nIn December alone, more than 35,000 Russian soldiers were killed or seriously wounded, Ukraine’s leader says, and the aim should be to raise the number even higher – to 50,000 per month.\n\n“Make the cost of war for Russia one it cannot sustain, thereby forcing peace through strength” – this was the task set him by the president, Mykhailo Fedorov told reporters in his first briefing as Defense Minister.\n\nThe suggestion that Russia is suffering heavy losses is not new. A new report last week estimated that 1.2 million Russians have either been killed, wounded or are missing since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago – the highest casualty figure suffered by a major military power since World War II. The report put the number of Ukrainian casualties between 500,000 and 600,000.\n\n“The data suggests Russia is hardly winning,” the report’s authors wrote.\n\nMaybe not, but as senior officials from Ukraine, Russia and the United States prepare for the next round of direct talks in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, it would be a mistake for Ukraine’s supporters to get carried away.\n\n“Highlighting the huge numbers of Russian fatalities is an indicator that Ukraine’s main strategy is attrition. But we need more than that if we are going to move the war dynamics in a better direction,” a former Ukrainian official told CNN.\n\nOn the one hand, focusing on headline-grabbing numbers offers important perspective on Ukraine’s refusal to give up Donetsk as part of any “peace” deal with Russia.\n\nThe logic behind Kyiv’s position is simple: Very few Ukrainians believe Putin has any goal other than the total subjugation of their country. So, why hand over territory for nothing if Ukraine can expect to kill hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers while Moscow keeps trying to capture Donetsk by force?\n\nUkrainian soldiers still hold about 20% of the eastern region, which includes heavily fortified cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and latest estimates by the Institute for the Study of War suggest it could be another 18 months before Russia captures it all.\n\nIf those Russian soldiers are not killed fighting – the logic continues – they will remain in occupied Ukrainian territory ready to restart the war, from a more advantageous position, just as soon as the Kremlin has contrived a pretext to do so.\n\nVery few in Ukraine believe Putin will drop his territorial demands, and most have lost faith that US President Donald Trump will apply necessary pressure to make him change his mind.\n\n“Despite the government negotiating in good faith, many think the whole process is done to ensure US government support,” the former Ukrainian official said.\n\n“People are exceedingly skeptical about the negotiating process.”\n\nBut if there is no confidence that negotiations are headed anywhere, what about Ukraine’s battlefield strategy? Is piling up the other side’s body bags the best way forward?\n\nAn American former fighter, Ryan O’Leary, who led an international volunteer unit called Chosen Company, believes not, triggering a vigorous debate after he laid out his arguments in a social media post.\n\nHe took issue with the much vaunted “e-points” scheme, whereby Ukraine’s units earn points for each Russian soldier killed or piece of materiel destroyed. The points are exchanged for new equipment, and the Defense Ministry says the scheme provides a wealth of data that helps shape future plans.\n\nBut O’Leary suggested they create the wrong incentives, causing Ukrainian commanders to prioritize more straightforward drone strikes against infantry targets around the line of combat, rather than tougher but more significant deep strikes against Russian logistics - like vehicles and communication hubs, as well as Russian drone crews operating from rear positions.\n\n“Drone warfare is not about who hits more soldiers today … Operational depth is where wars are decided. If the enemy can move fuel, ammo, drones, crews, and repair vehicles 10 to 40 km behind the line without fear, they own depth even if they lose 5x the men in trenches,” O’Leary wrote on X.\n\nIn truth, his accusation lays bare Ukraine’s two key structural challenges.\n\nFirstly, in drone technology, operating tactics and countermeasures, Russia has caught up and is quite possibly ahead.\n\nWriting on Facebook, Oleksandr Karpyuk, an aerial reconnaissance officer in the 59th Separate Assault Brigade, complained that Ukraine had failed to capitalize on its early advantage in this space, particularly by not diversifying the number of radio frequencies used by its drones to transmit signals.\n\nConsequently, once Russia improved its electronic warfare (EW) technologies, it needed to jam just two frequencies to put a significant dent in Ukraine’s ability to fly drones behind Russian lines.\n\nIn addition, Karpyuk writes, Russia’s tactical air defense crews are much improved, and Moscow continues to benefit from taking a lead in developing fiber-optic drones, which are impervious to Ukraine’s own EW countermeasures, because they do not transmit signals.\n\nAnd then there is Ukraine’s manpower issue.\n\nThe infantry shortage is well known. Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute estimates there are fewer than ten Ukrainian infantry soldiers per kilometer of front line. He also estimates that most brigades have at most 10% of their total personnel in the infantry. Traditionally, that number would be upwards of 30%.\n\nLee told KI Insights, a strategic intelligence unit powered by the Kyiv Independent, that even those low numbers have been enough to prevent a major breakthrough by Russian forces, which have succeeded only in making small, incremental advances.\n\nBut in a war where drones - not infantry - matter most, it is Ukraine’s shortfalls in drone crews that are most pressing, especially in the key battle for operational depth – the destruction of targets up to 25 miles (40 kilometers) behind the line of combat.\n\nIn a forthright defense of the fighters under his command, the head of Ukraine’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Forces, Robert Brovdi, said last week there needed to be a threefold increase in the number of drone operators. Just 30% of the frontline – which stretches 745 miles – is currently covered, he wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nFedorov, the new defense minister, acknowledges the scale of the problem, telling the Ukrainian parliament some 2 million people are ignoring their call-up papers, while 200,000 others have deserted.\n\nMuch now rests on his ability to address the manpower issue and to regain Ukraine’s technical edge, all the while ensuring he is hitting Zelensky’s targets.\n\n“Unless we constantly stay ahead of Russians in technology and battle tactics, I cannot say the chance we will prevail is high,” cautioned the former Ukrainian official.\n\nCNN’s Victoria Butenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina in Kyiv contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Frozen dessert fast-food chains are among the favorite shops that consumers enjoy visiting, but financial distress in some cases leads to bankruptcies and closings that disappoint customers.\n\nThe ice cream shop industry reported 0.9% growth in 2025, according to data from IBISWorld, but still faces economic issues.\n\n\"Despite the general increase in appetite for ice cream, significant challenges must be navigated,\" IBISWorld said in the report.\n\nAmong the economic challenges the report cited is the rising cost of milk, which cuts into profits.\n\nTariffs on Canadian dairy products have also increased the cost of milk and butter that are essential for ice cream production, which drives up retail prices and reduces profit margins, the report said.\n\nCustomers' most preferred shops include Baskin-Robbins, Ben & Jerry's, Cold Stone Creamery, Dairy Queen, and Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers.\n\nCertain chains ran into some economic problems in 2025 that forced them to file for bankruptcy or close locations.\n\nIce cream shop operators have stated a variety of reasons for closing down, including rising costs of labor and products driven by inflation or, more recently, tariffs; high lease payments; increased costs of debt from higher interest rates; and changing attitudes toward shopping by consumers.\n\nAbout 30 Dairy Queens in Texas lost their franchises in the first half of 2025 when the parent company, American Dairy Queen, pulled the franchises from franchisee Project Lonestar after it failed to remodel its locations. That meant that those locations could not order supplies from the parent corporation and would have to shut down.\n\nAnd now the parent company of the Cream ice cream shop chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize and restructure its debts, which includes an employment law lawsuit judgment.\n\nCreamy Treats Inc. filed its petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California on Feb. 2, listing $500,000 to $1 million in assets and $100,000 to $500,000 in liabilities.\n\nThe San Francisco-based ice cream shop chain, which specializes in fresh ice cream sandwiches, did not list a specific reason for filing for bankruptcy protection, but among its largest unsecured creditors was Halil Budan, who is owed $98,000 for an employment law lawsuit. The debtor also listed Square Financial Services, owed $27,000.\n\n73-year-old family diner franchisee files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nMore troubled regional airlines file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nMajor department store brand liquidates in Chapter 11 bankruptcy",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Historians and observers accused the Trump administration of trying to rewrite American history to justify its own foreign policy decisions toward Latin America by posting a “historically inaccurate” version of the Mexican-American war.\n\nThe Monday statement from the White House commemorating the anniversary of the war described the conflict as a “legendary victory that secured the American Southwest, reasserted American sovereignty, and expanded the promise of American independence across our majestic continent.” The statement drew parallels between the period in U.S. history and its own increasingly aggressive policies toward Latin America, which it said would “ensure the Hemisphere remains safe.”\n\n“Guided by our victory on the fields of Mexico 178 years ago, I have spared no effort in defending our southern border against invasion, upholding the rule of law, and protecting our homeland from forces of evil, violence, and destruction,” the statement said, though it was unsigned.\n\nIn the post, the White House makes no mention of the key role slavery played in the war and glorifies the wider “Manifest Destiny” period, which resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Native Americans from their land.\n\nAlexander Aviña, Latin American history professor at Arizona State University, said the White House statement “underplays the massive amounts of violence that it took to expand” the U.S. to the Pacific shore at a time when the Trump administration has stuck its hand in Latin American affairs in a way not seen in decades, deposing Venezuela's president, meddling in elections and threatening military action in Mexico and other countries.\n\n“U.S. political leaders since then have seen this as an ugly aspect of U.S. history, this is a pretty clear instance of U.S. imperialism against its southern neighbor,” Aviña said. “The Trump administration is actually embracing this as a positive in U.S. history and framing it – inaccurately historically – as some sort of defensive measure to prevent the Mexico from invading them.”\n\nOn Tuesday, criticisms of the White House statement quickly rippled across social media.\n\nAsked about the statement in her morning news briefing, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum guffawed, quipping and noting “we have to defend sovereignty.” Sheinbaum, who has walked a tight rope with the Trump administration, has responded to Trump with a balanced tone and occasionally with sarcasm, like when Trump changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nThe Mexican-American war (1846–1848) was triggered by long-running border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico and the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845. For years leading up to the war, Americans had gradually moved into the then-Mexican territory. Mexico had banned slavery and U.S. abolitionists feared the U.S. land grab was in part an attempt to add slave states.\n\nAfter fighting broke out and successive U.S. victories, Mexico ceded more than 525,000 square miles of territory — including what now comprises Arizona, California, western Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah — to the U.S.\n\nThe moment turned Texas into a key chess piece during the U.S. Civil War and led former President Ulysses S. Grant to write later that the conflict with Mexico was “one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was formed when five New York City newspapers funded a pony express route through Alabama to bring news of the Mexican War — as it is sometimes known in the U.S. — north faster than the U.S. Post Office could deliver it.\n\nThe war continues to be a historical sticking point between the two countries, particularly as Sheinbaum repeatedly reminds Trump that her country is a sovereign nation whenever Trump openly weighs taking military action against Mexican cartels and pressures Mexico to bend to its will.\n\nThe White House statement falls in line with wider actions taken by the Trump administration to mold the federal government's language around its own creed, said Albert Camarillo, history professor at Stanford University, who described the statement as a “distorted, ahistorical, imperialist version\" of the war.\n\nAviña said the statement serves \"to assert rhetorically that the U.S. is justified in establishing its so-called ‘America First’ policy throughout the Americas,” regardless of the historical accuracy.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered the rewriting of history on display at the Smithsonian Institution, saying it was “restoring truth and sanity to American history.”\n\nThe administration has scrubbed government websites of history, legal records and data it finds disagreeable. Trump also ordered the government to remove any signs that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living,\" including those making reference to slavery, destruction of Native American cultures and climate change.\n\n“This statement is consistent with so many others that attempt to whitewash and reframe U.S. history and erase generations of historical scholarship,” Camarillo said.",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Tuesday the country should make “any sacrifice necessary” to preserve the independence of the country in the face of threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nHarper, a Conservative prime minister for nearly a decade from 2006 to 2015, made the remarks in a speech during his official portrait unveiling.\n\nHarper described the times as perilous and thanked current Prime Minister Mark Carney for attending the unveiling “at a time when challenges are unprecedented during our lives.”\n\nTrump has talked about making Canada the 51st state and has threatened the country with tariffs.\n\nThe Republican president’s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance, alarming Canada, which shares a 3,000-kilometer (1,864 mile) maritime border with Greenland in the Arctic.\n\nHarper didn’t mention Trump by name but urged Canada’s two major parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, to unify in the face of threats to the country’s sovereignty.\n\n“We must make any sacrifice necessary to preserve the independence and the unity of this blessed land,” Harper said.\n\nHarper said he hopes his portrait is only one of the many portraits of prime ministers of both parties that will continue to be exhibited for decades and centuries to come.\n\n“But that will require that in these perilous times that both parties, whatever their other differences, come together against external forces that threaten our independence,” he said.\n\nHarper also warned against “domestic policies that threaten our unity.” A separatist moment in Alberta could garner enough votes this spring to trigger a referendum for independence from Canada.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has said separatist support is about at 30%. Smith is pressuring the federal government and the British Columbia provincial government on the Pacific coast to approve a new oil pipeline to the Pacific.\n\nHarper approved of Carney’s resume when Carney applied to be the head of Canada’s central bank during Harper's time as prime minister. He joked the then-young man “has apparently gone on to enjoy some success.”\n\nCarney later became the head of the Bank of England in 2013 and prime minister of Canada last year.\n\nCarney thanked Harper for denouncing those who are threatening Canada’s sovereignty as Canada was confronted with unprecedented attacks and trade pressures.\n\n“He called on us to build a stronger Canada less dependent on the U.S.,” Carney said. “He also took the time to advise me which I have greatly appreciated.”\n\nCarney also commended Harper for his economic stewardship during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n“He came to Ottawa as a balanced-budget conservative. He believed rightly that governments should live within their means. Yet when the financial crisis struck, he did not let ideology prevent him from doing what was necessary, running deficits for five years to support the Canadian economy through the worst global downturn in generations.,” Carney said.\n\n“Mr. Harper understood that you build up strength in good times to have the capacity to act in bad times.”",

She was in the garage to warm up her car when she heard the microwave start, and thought Caleb was warming up his breakfast.\n\n\"After hearing what she described as a blood-curdling scream, she knew something was wrong,\" the medical center said, confirming that Caleb had attempted to microwave the popular sensory toy. However, when he opened the microwave, the object, \"filled with gelatinous material, exploded on his face and hands.\"\n\nGrubb tried to rinse off the substance in the shower; however, it didn't work. She took him to the emergency room, and he was later transferred to Loyola Medicine’s Burn Center.  He also saw an ophthalmologist to treat his eye, which was swollen shut.\n\nHis vision was not impacted and Caleb is now recovering at home, Loyola Medicine said.\n\nThe Nice Cube is a “sensory squish is perfect for stretching, smushing, squeezing, and soothing,” according to the official website. “Do NOT heat, freeze, or microwave, may cause personal injury,” the site warning states.\n\nHe suffered second-degree burns on one side and on his hands, his mother told CBS News. He is expected to return to school later this week.\n\nPaula Petersen, APN, a burn center advanced practice nurse, remarked in Loyola's news release how Caleb is \"very lucky he didn’t sustain greater injuries.\" She added, \"These trends can be extremely dangerous for young people who are less likely to consider or unable to understand the serious consequences.”\n\nMcElligott said the young boy is the fourth child who has come into the facility because of the trend. \"A child who heated it up in the microwave, then put her finger on it and her finger went through, and it burned her finger,\" McElligott said, according to CBS News.\n\nShe told WGN9 that 30% of their patients are pediatric patients. “I think it’s every day common things in the home that are burning these kids and we want to make sure that parents should be diligent about what’s in their house,” she said, citing the aforementioned toys as well as “ramen noodles coming out of the microwave that kids spill on themselves, or little kids pulling hot coffee off the counter.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nPEOPLE reached out to Schylling for comment.",

    "description": "The World Health Organization found that nearly 40% of cancer cases worldwide are linked to preventable causes.",
    "fullText": "A new report from the World Health Organization found that nearly 7 million cases of cancer worldwide were preventable.\n\nAnalyzing 18.7 million new cancer cases in 2022 (the most recent data available to them), researchers found that nearly 4 out of 10 cases were linked to 30 modifiable risk factors, including smoking tobacco, infections like HPV and hepatitis B, and consuming alcohol. Stomach, lung, and cervical cancer accounted for almost half of all preventable cancers in the report.\n\nThe findings are a comprehensive assessment of cancer cases globally, which vary greatly by region, so while promising, they come with limitations. \n\nThe news comes less than two weeks after it was revealed that colon cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in people under 50.\n\nCancer can be caused by a variety of factors, including family history, genetic mutations, and environmental pollutants — all things out of our control — but some risk can be mitigated with lifestyle modifications.\n\nResearch shows that diets involving lots of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are linked to higher cancer risk. They can increase inflammation and disrupt the gut microbiome, increasing the risk of colon and ovarian cancer.\n\nA diet rich in whole foods is the best way to go. Dr. Daniel Landau, an oncologist specializing in genitourinary cancers, previously told Business Insider that he mostly follows the Mediterranean diet, focusing on lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes while limiting red meat (which might be carcinogenic), dairy, alcohol, sugar, and UPFs.\n\nGut-healthy foods are also important. Dr. Susan Bullman, an associate professor at MD Anderson Cancer Center who specializes in gut health and cancer research, previously told Business Insider that she eats fiber-rich foods like pears and probiotics like kefir to feed beneficial gut microbes. Eating a wide variety of plants, such as swapping out vegetable sides or sprinkling seeds on top of salads, can also improve gut health.\n\nExercise has long been associated with a reduced risk of cancer. One 2025 trial found that a strict workout regimen for preventing colon cancer resurgence than expensive treatments like chemotherapy. While scientists are still exploring the reasons why exercise is so effective at cancer prevention, they have their theories. Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone, previously told Business Insider that exercise is probably reducing inflammation, which may help slow tumor growth.\n\nDr. Sue Hwang, an oncologist who was diagnosed with breast cancer, said you should aim for 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether it's strength training or cardio.\n\nIf you can't make it to a gym every day, she said, even taking a walk or playing with your kids in a playground helps. Even vigorous daily movements, like climbing up stairs or carrying heavy groceries, can cut down cancer risk. Still, the best thing you can do is pencil in real workouts.\n\nBeing aware of early cancer symptoms, like blood in your stool for colon cancer, can help you seek screenings earlier than the recommended starting age.\n\nIt's also important to be aware of your family history, any genetic mutations like Lynch syndrome that increase risks of several cancers, or other factors like PCOS for endometrial cancer.\n\nDr. Thaïs Aliabadi, an OB-GYN who helped Olivia Munn get diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, said collecting data on your body, such as previous biopsies or breast density, can help you better assess your risk.",

    "description": "Chipotle plans to raise prices this year, but executives said on Tuesday that their core consumer, who makes over $100k, probably won't mind.",
    "fullText": "Chipotle Mexican Grill plans to raise menu prices by 1-2% this year — and leadership is betting that its core consumer segment, digital natives who earn over $100k, won't mind.\n\nSpeaking during Tuesday's fourth-quarter earnings call, interim CEO Scott Boatwright said Chipotle is focusing on boosting foot traffic and revenue amid weak comparable sales. To do that, they're targeting their core customer, who sits firmly at the top end of the K-shaped economy.\n\nChipotle recently conducted a \"deep dive\" of consumer research to identify the demographics and desires of its core audience and refine its strategy accordingly, Boatwright said.\n\n\"What we've learned is the guest skews younger, a little higher income, is typically a digital native, and that their grounded purpose aligns with our North Star as a brand, around clean food, clean ingredients, high protein,\" Boatwright said. \"We are the way they want to eat, and we're going to lean into that in the most meaningful way.\"\n\n\"After looking at the data last week, we learned that 60% of our core users are over $100,000 a year in average household income,\" he added. \"That gives us confidence that we can lean into that group in a more meaningful way, whether it's the solo occasion and/or group occasions to really drive meaningful transaction performance in the year.\"\n\nChipotle beat revenue estimates in 2025, its earnings report released on Tuesday showed, despite comparable restaurant sales decreasing 1.7%. The company projected its comparable sales in 2026 would be \"about flat,\" accounting for the openings of between 350 and 370 new restaurants.\n\nIn 2026, Chipotle's margins will remain \"under pressure,\" Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer said during the call, so consumers can expect pricing to increase 1-2% to narrow the gap between rising expenses and menu prices.\n\nThe broader restaurant segment is struggling with slumping sales as the K-shaped economy has upended the typical playbook for value deals and marketing campaigns. Lower-income consumers have been cutting back on spending, especially dining out, as they face rising costs across the board, while higher-income households show no signs of slowing their spending.\n\nTo draw in traffic, Chipotle recently launched its new protein snack menu, allowing customers to purchase a single taco or a side of meat (either chicken or steak) in a cup. It has also sped up the cadence of its limited-time offer releases, such as the recent promotions for chicken al pastor and red chimichurri sauce.\n\nThose promotions seem to be working, and are proof that Chipotle's core customer isn't particularly price-sensitive, Boatwright said during Tuesday's call.\n\nPrior to the protein snack menu debut, Boatwright said leadership considered whether the launch would result in a \"consumer trade-down\" effect, a common phenomenon in which price-sensitive consumers opt for a discount deal or a lower-cost menu item than they'd usually order to find better value — but \"frankly, we just didn't see it.\"\n\nInstead of becoming a cheaper alternative to their usual favorite, customers are frequently purchasing the protein side as an add-on to their typical order, which Boatwright said \"gives us confidence that the core consumer is not necessarily looking for a smaller, lower price-pointed component to the menu.\"\n\nBoatwright added that Chipotle will continue to test ideas to keep consumers coming back, including more limited-time offers and drink innovations. He also teased a \"Happier Hour\" deal specifically to re-engage younger and lower-income customers, but he added, \"I don't know if it'll be a meaningful unlock for Chipotle.\"\n\nChipotle's stock sank by more than 6% in after-hours trading.",

    "fullText": "Snow White has made another appearance in the Epstein files.\n\nA June 2010 email contained in the latest tranche of documents released by the Justice Department shows the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein asking an unidentified person to get a costume of the beloved Disney character.\n\n\"i would love to take photos of you in a snow white costume,\" Epstein wrote. \"you can get it from the costume store.\"\n\n\"Will get it!\" the person responded.\n\nThe email — which was first reported by The Financial Times — isn't the only time that the guest of the Seven Dwarfs has been mentioned in the files.\n\nA few weeks later, ex-Barclays CEO Jes Staley sent an email to Epstein, whom he had known for years, that said: \"That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.\"\n\nEpstein responded: \"[W]hat character would you like next?\" When Staley said \"Beauty and the Beast,\" Epstein replied: \"Well one side is available.\"\n\nAlso in July 2010, an unknown person emailed Epstein with the cryptic comment: \"the snow white was f..ed twice as soon as she put her costume))\".\n\nIt's not known if there is any connection between the various references to Snow White.\n\nThe Staley email exchange was initially released after the government of the Virgin Islands sued JPMorgan Chase, alleging it facilitated Epstein's sex-trafficking activities in the Caribbean, where he owned two islands.\n\nThe VI lawyers claimed in court papers that the Disney princess references were code for young women. Staley, who was a private banker at JPMorgan before he went to Barclays, testified in a different case that he did not remember the emails.\n\nEpstein — who had dealings with the rich, famous, and powerful even after he pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008 — killed himself in a Manhattan prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sweeping sex-trafficking charges.\n\nScrutiny of Staley's ties to Epstein led to his departure from Barclays in 2021. Two years later, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority banned him from management positions in financial services.\n\nStaley appealed, which resulted in him taking the stand, where he testified that his relationship with Epstein was largely professional. He also testified that he had sex with one of Epstein's staff members at the apartment of Epstein's brother. The ban was upheld.\n\nLawyers for Staley didn't immediately return a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI has filled a key safety role by hiring from a rival lab.\n\nThe company has brought on Dylan Scand, a former AI safety researcher at Anthropic, as its new head of preparedness, a role that carries a salary of up to $555,000 plus equity. The role caught attention last month thanks to its eye-catching pay package amid OpenAI's rising AI safety concerns.\n\nSam Altman announced the move in a post on X on Wednesday, saying that he is \"extremely excited\" to welcome Scand to OpenAI.\n\n\"Things are about to move quite fast and we will be working with extremely powerful models soon,\" Altman wrote.\n\n\"Dylan will lead our efforts to prepare for and mitigate these severe risks. He is by far the best candidate I have met, anywhere, for this role,\" he added.\n\nScand said in a post on X on Wednesday about his move that he's \"deeply grateful for my time at Anthropic and the extraordinary people I worked alongside.\"\n\n\"AI is advancing rapidly. The potential benefits are great — and so are the risks of extreme and even irrecoverable harm,\" he added.\n\nLast month, Altman described the job as \"stressful.\"\n\n\"You'll jump into the deep end almost immediately,\" he wrote on X.\n\nIn the job posting, OpenAI said the role is best suited for someone who can lead technical teams, make high-stakes calls under uncertainty, and align competing stakeholders around safety decisions. The company also said candidates should have deep expertise in machine learning, AI safety, and related risk areas.\n\nTensions have arisen over OpenAI's approach to safety. Several early employees — including a former head of its safety team — have left the company in recent years.\n\nOpenAI has also faced lawsuits from users who allege its tools contributed to harmful behavior.\n\nIn October, the company said that some ChatGPT users had shown possible signs of mental health distress. An estimated 560,000 users a week show \"possible signs of mental health emergencies,\" it said.\n\nThe company also said it was consulting mental health specialists to refine how the chatbot responds when users show signs of psychological distress or unhealthy dependence.",

    "description": "After 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard, Andrew Miller landed a corporate role at Amazon — but with 6 kids, it didn't leave him enough time to be a dad.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Miller, 50, in Mount Vernon, Washington, the owner of Tulip Valley Farms. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI remember the moment I looked around my office and saw only performative culture staring back at me.\n\nBetween 70-hour workweeks that started at 4 a.m. and growing disagreements with how the company was being run, I knew something had to give.\n\nIt wasn't hard work that scared me. Before corporate life, I spent 14 years in the Air Force and National Guard.\n\nBut as my family grew, I started questioning the path I was on. I'd never been deployed, but I knew it was likely. With two autistic children at home, my family needed me present. After leaving the military, I landed a corporate role at Amazon.\n\nIt went well for a while, but I was rarely seeing my family, and it wasn't the life I'd envisioned. I realized that while some people live for their role, my most important job was being a dad — I have six kids.\n\nSo, in 2015, I quit my job at Amazon. My wife, Holly, supported my decision, knowing that I was completely drained and losing my sense of purpose.\n\nWe also decided it was time to move back to Washington, where we both grew up.\n\nSkagit County is a place where your kids can run down the trail to a relative's house if they don't like what you're serving for dinner.\n\nIt's also home to an annual tulip festival that's been held for over 40 years.\n\nI took a strategy role with the county's economic development team, working on growth and equity.\n\nSkagit sits at the intersection of outdoor recreation, tourism, and agriculture — yet while the county once had about 4,000 acres of tulips, that number had dropped to roughly 500. I knew we needed a new model, or this county wouldn't be the home of tulips anymore.\n\nI came up with an idea and went for it. I decided to buy a tulip farm and reimagine what it could be — not just a working farm, but a place people wanted to hang out.\n\nIn 2018, I bought my first farm. In the months leading up to the purchase, I quickly learned that many agricultural problems are really business problems.\n\nThe questions weren't just about growing tulips; they were about the experience: How many tulips could we grow? What kind of customer experience could we create? And how should we design the layout of the fields for tourists?\n\nTo prepare, I raised capital with friends and spent six weeks shadowing an 85-year-old Dutch farmer who had been growing tulips since 1984. He and his wife told me they had turned down 16 other buyers before choosing me. He died shortly afterward, and after his death, I moved forward with taking over the farm.\n\nMy former business partner and I bought the 30-acre property for $1.6 million, including both the land and the business.\n\nIn those first months of farm life, my approach was pure curiosity.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, just 10 days before opening.\n\nWe pivoted to flower shipping, and eventually added you-pick experiences once restrictions eased. From what I could see, no one in Skagit County was doing that.\n\nI've learned that I tend to learn things the hard way. My daughter even bought me a pen that reads: \"Maybe I like doing it the hard way.\"\n\nThe fresh approach worked, but my business partnership didn't. After differences in vision, we split, and I went on to buy a second farm: Tulip Valley Farm, which I still run today. I bought it from a 70-year-old potato farmer with hazelnut trees.\n\nToday, my 23-year-old son can operate a forklift, which he learned when he was 15. My sister runs business management and communications.\n\nI still work from 5 a.m. until bedtime, but now I'm home. I'm serving my community.\n\nI'll walk into Costco, and my kids will scatter when someone recognizes me from the farm. My family is happy to know we can take three weeks off in the summer because of how hard we work the rest of the year.\n\nThey've seen the strain, the kitchen-table meetings, the risk of starting from scratch. I want them to see that.\n\nHealing in the soil — for us, and for guests\n\nToday, the farm is flourishing. Visitor numbers have doubled year over year for the past three years. We design the fields not just for farming, but for connection — proposals, photos, moments people want to share.\n\nIn a world where we are gagging for meaningful in-person experiences, people are drawn to farms. I get it. As someone with PTSD from my former career, I can also affirm that dirt therapy is the best therapy.\n\nBeing able to shape your own environment and build your own future is essential.",

    "fullText": "Gold bounced above $5,000 an ounce on Tuesday as investors rushed back into the metal following one of the sharpest selloffs in decades.\n\nSpot gold was trading around $5,072 per troy ounce at 11:10 p.m. ET on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session, when prices jumped more than 6%.\n\n\"The recovery in metals coincided with a broader improvement across financial markets,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING, adding that the rebound also came as the US dollar gave back some of its earlier gains from the initial phase of the sell-off.\n\nThe reversal came after a brutal collapse in gold prices on Friday and Monday, following a record high above $5,500 per troy ounce on Thursday.\n\nThe selloff was magnified by President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair. Warsh is widely viewed as the most hawkish candidate, which drove the US dollar sharply higher and sparked aggressive profit-taking in gold.\n\nHowever, the drawdown was already underway in what had become a crowded trade, with market mechanics accelerating the move lower.\n\n\"The move was largely fueled by a wave of speculative buying from China, from retail traders to larger equity funds rotating into commodities, with fresh flows pushing prices to extreme levels before last week's abrupt reversal,\" wrote Manthey.\n\nWestern call options — contracts that give investors the right to buy gold at a set price and are often used to hedge geopolitical and global macro risks — also played a central role in amplifying the rally, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nThat demand faded after Warsh's nomination, triggering a wave of technical selling that cascaded into system-wide losses.\n\nMany analysts still see further upside for gold, arguing that the selloff reflected positioning rather than a deterioration in fundamentals. Key drivers include geopolitical risks, haven demand, and central bank buying.\n\nGoldman forecasts gold at $5,400 per ounce by this December.\n\nSilver's market dynamics are more extreme.\n\nSilver prices also advanced on Tuesday after a 36% plunge on Friday and a sharp additional drop on Monday. Prices had reached record levels above $121 per ounce on Thursday.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $87.50 per ounce at 11:09 p.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\n\"Silver is often nicknamed 'gold on steroids' — it tends to move much more than gold in percentage terms. Its smaller market size and exposure to both investment and industrial demand tend to amplify price moves in both directions,\" wrote Manthey.\n\nManthey added that silver prices are likely to remain volatile as the white metal is more sensitive to shifts in sentiment and positioning than gold.\n\nThat's even as medium-term industrial demand continues to underpin the silver market amid tight supplies in London, the hub of global silver trading.\n\n\"The persistent London liquidity squeeze adds an additional layer of extreme price behavior on top of the same call‑structure‑driven volatility seen in gold,\" wrote the Goldman analysts.",

But first to the past, when this story begins, about 275-280m years ago. “There was a continental collision at the time,” Frances Wall, professor of applied mineralogy at the Camborne School of Mines at the University of Exeter, explained to me before my visit. This collision caused the bottom of the Earth’s crust to melt, with the molten material rising higher in the crust and forming granite. “There are lots of different types of granite that intrude at different times, more than 10m years or so,” she says. “The rock is made of minerals and, if you’ve got the right composition in the original material and the right conditions, then within those minerals there are some called mica. Some of those micas contain lithium.”\n\nThat’s what we are talking about here: lithium, the L-word. Or possibly the El Dorado word; lithium is often referred to as “white gold”, and in 2021 the then PM Boris Johnson declared that Cornwall would be the “Klondike of lithium”.\n\nIt is not breaking news that there is lithium here. Victorian miners reported finding it in the water coming from the ground. (You may know, possibly from Poldark, about Cornwall’s rich history mining tin and copper; it has been going on since the early bronze age, in about 2000BC.) Back then there was little use for lithium. Now it is a very different story. Its high electrochemical potential means lithium can hold a charge for longer than most other elements and so is ideal for use in rechargeable batteries. That’s phones, laptops and so much of the technology we use. Plus, electric cars and big battery storage projects. Lithium is now among the most important mined elements on the planet.\n\nMost of the world’s lithium is extracted in Australia and the lithium triangle in South America (Chile, Argentina and Bolivia), as well as in China, which also processes and therefore controls a majority of it for use in batteries. Cornwall doesn’t compare in scale, but it is, says Wall, “probably the largest lithium deposit in Europe”. A couple of companies – British Lithium and Cornish Lithium – are leading the way to tap into it.\n\nJeremy Wrathall is the founder of the latter. When he graduated from Camborne School of Mines in 1988, mining in Cornwall was gasping its last breaths – with just four active mines left, down from more than 300 in the 1860s. Now there are none, though there are still some china clay (kaolin) operations. So Wrathall went to work in South African goldmines, before returning to London to work as a mining analyst and financier.\n\nCornwall remained in his heart, though, and when electric cars began to be a thing, he remembered hearing about the lithium there. “I put lithium plus Cornwall into Google and up came four historical records of lithium being found in water. I thought: that one is an awful long way away from that one, they must be geologically connected. And then I thought: maybe I’m on to something and should start picking up mineral rights. So that’s what I did.”\n\nAlong with the mineral rights for which he did deals, Wrathall acquired a number of 19th-century mining plans, which gave him information about geological features – the granite and what was in it. He founded Cornish Lithium in 2016.\n\nWrathall says the UK – particularly Cornwall – will be able to extract 50,000 tonnes of lithium (actually lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate equivalent, depending on how it’s extracted) a year for more than 20 years – about 50% of the UK’s annual needs by 2030. There are two methods. One is to extract lithium from water via deep boreholes, which we will get to later. Here at Trelavour is the company’s “hard rock extraction” site. Wrathall picks up a small piece of rock. “You can see the sparkly bits, that’s the mica – all of this rock, everything you can see, has lithium.”\n\nHe explains that there will be some blasting, then the granite will be dug from the quarry and crushed before going on a conveyor belt to the processing plant in the valley. But, hang on; this doesn’t sound super sustainable, even if the intended destination is the UK’s transition to clean renewable energy. Lithium mining projects in Portugal and Serbia have been hampered by fierce opposition from locals and environmentalists. In Argentina, mining companies and politicians have been accused of robbing Indigenous people of their water and employing colonial-style divide-and-rule tactics in pursuit of the valuable metal. Why is that not happening here?\n\nWall explains that it is a very different process in South America, where brine gets pumped into a series of ponds and then evaporates slowly in the sun. Cornwall has neither the geology nor climate for that. Trelavour is a traditional quarry, “so you’ve got all your normal stuff associated with quarrying: drilling, blasting and lorries.” Environmental permits are very strict, she says, and they’ll need to sort out what they’re doing with the waste. “But the granite is pretty benign, it’s not like some of the sulphides, where you have a lot of trouble with acid mine drainage [the outflow of acidic water largely from metal and coal mines].”\n\nSome of the byproducts could be valuable: silica for cement, sulphate of potash for fertiliser, gypsum for plasterboard. Wrathall says the company’s crushers are electric and it will look into using electric trucks. “We’re trying our best to go zero carbon, or very low carbon.” The situation in Cornwall is different from the controversial projects in Europe, he says, because the quarry already exists; they will simply be repurposing it. “You can see the damage is done. In Portugal, it is a pristine area, olive groves, it would be digging up people’s farms. This is not a farm. What are you going to do with this? It’s dangerous, fenced-off to stop people getting in. And at the end of it, we will rehabilitate it.”\n\nI have found it hard to find anyone who is really against the project. Charmian Larke of the Cornwall Climate Action Network says: “Because the area is so destroyed anyway, the surrounding villages tend to be very poor, with poor health and educational outcomes.” Wrathall says the Cornish people are proud of their 4,000-year history of mining, “and it will bring back economic prosperity to an area with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country”.\n\nOn cue, we are joined by Peter Morse, general manager of the hard-rock project here. He grew up in the nearby village of Roche. His family has been here for generations, he says, mostly working in the china clay industry, and he used to ride around in a truck with his grandad, driving in and out of the plants. He thought he would go into it, too, and did a geology degree. Instead, he went to the US, where he worked in the mining industry for 30 years.\n\nWrathall and Morse are what are known as “Cousin Jacks” – Cornish miners who went abroad to work. “If you go anywhere in the world and there’s a hole, there’ll be a Cousin Jack at the bottom of it,” says Morse. They took a bit of Cornwall with them: he says he could get a pasty on the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nWhen he came back home, it was different from when he left: fewer people were employed in the china clay business. St Dennis, the village nearest to the site, used to have three pubs and a bunch of shops. Now there is just one of each. “And St Austell is not the town it was when I went to school there. It was bustling, lively – but it doesn’t feel like that now.”\n\nMorse says lithium can help to reverse the trend. Cousin Jack is back. I also spoke to Noah Law, another local, now Labour MP for St Austell and Newquay. “Mining is part of our heritage, it’s part of what makes Cornwall great. It has made us wealthy in the past and can do the same again.”\n\nThings have changed though. “Mining is more capital intensive than it used to be, and not as labour intensive. Part of the challenge is sharing the prosperity. I’ve levelled with the industry to say we’re really invested in this and are going to work hard to make a success of the industry, if it is willing to work really hard to make sure my constituents are sharing the spoils.”\n\nLaw says Cornwall can be a beautiful place and an industrial powerhouse, “because that’s what we have been for the most of the past 200-300 years. It’s only recently that Cornwall hasn’t been an industrial economy.”\n\nCornish Lithium employs just over 100 people, and the plan is to triple that. “Every mining job provides at least four times as many knock-on jobs,” says Wrathall. And not just another shop selling wetsuits or ice cream. “They’re good, but that’s not going to make any difference to the lives of people here. What is going to make a difference is the development of an industry that is already here, but is now seeing its next generation. It’s going to change Cornwall’s future.”\n\nWe have come down from the quarry to the processing plant, where the lithium gets extracted from the granite. At this stage it’s a demonstration facility, but it still takes up a huge shed, a remnant of a former china clay facility. The crushed granite comes in at one end and the lithium is extracted in a series of processes. First physical – milling, soaking, spinning – followed by chemical separation that involves dissolving the mica in sulphuric acid. All the machinery – mills and pipes, scrubbers and chillers, pumps and vats – looks rather Willy Wonka. And here’s a bag of the end product – lithium hydroxide, a white crystalline power that looks, frankly, illegal.\n\nAbout 20 miles away, the villages of St Day and Gwennap were once big centres for tin and copper mining and the surrounding landscape is dotted with derelict brick engine houses from that time. Between the two is now the centre for Cornish Lithium’s other project: geothermal extraction. It doesn’t look much, a capped borehole in the corner of the United Downs industrial estate, but under the cap a shaft goes down 800 metres. This was the first exploratory hole. They’ve since done others, including one 2km deep on a farm a few miles away at Cross Lanes. The results were very positive and Cross Lanes has recently been granted planning permission for the country’s first commercial geothermal lithium production facility.\n\nIn another shed, Adam Matthews, who leads the geology team, shows me what it’s all about. Laid out on trays are hundreds of core samples of rock from the Cross Lanes drill holes: they look like pencil leads for giants. One is solid, “siltstone and sandstones mostly, the darker bands are muds, nothing of much interest”, says Matthews. But here’s one from 1,700 metres down, “and you can see fractures running throughout the rock. The water flows naturally throughout those fractures.”\n\nIn this water – hot brine – they have found lithium. The next stage is to drill two new larger diameter 2km-deep holes, one to pump the water out, the other to return it once the lithium has been extracted. It’s probably the least impactful, most sustainable way of getting hold of lithium.\n\nThe water at that depth is between 80 and 90C and Wrathall says it could be used to provide low-carbon heat energy for communities and industries. There are few houses to heat near to Cross Lanes, but he says the heat could be used in agriculture. “There is an opportunity to build greenhouses there, to grow tomatoes and cucumbers.”\n\nIt sounds wonderful – pumping water out of the ground, extracting the mineral that will help the country on its transition to renewable energy, then returning the water to where it came from … with a byproduct of locally grown salad.\n\nBut we’re not quite there yet. The next phase will be to build a demonstration plant to produce samples of lithium. If successful, the company will build a commercial production plant there. The Trelavour hard rock site is also still at the demonstration phase. Wrathall thinks they will first be producing lithium commercially in 2028 or 29. Even then the UK will still have to import about half of what it needs. Reliance on China isn’t over yet.\n\nSince they’ve been looking at lithium in Cornwall, “we’ve seen critical minerals go from ‘Who cares?’ to ‘Oh my goodness, what are we going to do?’” says Wrathall. “Why is Trump interested in Greenland? Minerals. Ukraine? Minerals. Canada? Minerals? I’m just hoping he doesn’t find out about Cornwall!”",

    "description": "Jarran Reed is in his second stint with the Seahawks and does not take his path to Super Bowl LX for granted.",
    "fullText": "Jarran Reed earns a living in the pit, the trenches of NFL combat, and this pleases the Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle to no end.\n\nHe is a football lifer, a 10th year veteran of interior clashes and scrums that often decide the winners and losers in a sport rooted in crunching contact. On Tuesday afternoon in San Jose, the 6-foot-3, 315-pound 33-year-old Reed beamed at what he has accomplished, and his journey to Super Bow LX on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium. You can be sure he will have a say in how it all turns out against the New England Patriots.\n\nA native of Goldsboro High School in North Carolina, Reed’s story is a familiar one in the Pacific Northwest. He has reveled at the chance to be a run-stuffer and quarterback chaser since he first slipped on shoulder pads and a helmet. He ground his way through East Mississippi Community College, shoring up his game and his academics, and he starred with the Alabama Crimson Tide on the defensive line.\n\nA second-round draft pick by Seattle in 2016, Reed spent the 2021 season with the Kansas City Chiefs and the 2022 campaign with the Green Bay Packers. He re-signed with Seattle in 2023, signing a $12.8 million deal before having it extended in March to a 3-year package for $25 million.\n\nAll told, Reed has done his share of the heavy lifting in helping propel the Seahawks to the season’s final weekend in the franchise’s 50th year. And it isn’t just warding off blockers and plugging gaps that make Reed invaluable. He is a locker room leader who offers fiery pep talks as a veteran who has seen it all. Coach Mike Macdonald often has Reed address the team after games, anointing the veteran to mentor and inspire one of the NFL’s youngest teams.\n\nReed takes none of his path for granted, not in a sport where change is part of the business. Reed has been too good to supplant, and he said he wants to play several more seasons.\n\n“Oh, not one bit (do I take this for granted),” Reed said. “Everybody’s journey is different. I’m very grateful for this, and it’s taught me a lot. Coming from Goldsboro, North Carolina to East Mississippi, then Alabama...all the roles were there to get me to this moment.”\n\nReed said the Seahawks immediately responded to Macdonald, the defensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens in 2022 and 2023 who was hired as head coach by Seattle before the 2024 season.\n\n“It started early with OTA’s, and we attack the day, attack the week,” Reed said. “Everybody needs to be tackled.”\n\nReed said he enjoys studying game film, be it the linemen he will encounter or the ball carriers the Seahawks are tasked to stop. He said that he is big on preparation, mind and body. He said that he thinks of NFL stars over the years who did not reach a Super Bowl.\n\n“Some greats never made it, never got a chance to experience this,” Reed said. “Man, I’m here, Year 10. I got a national championship in junior college, and at Alabama, and now I’m here to see if we can pull it out in the Super Bowl this week.”\n\nReed has always been country strong and became stronger through strength and conditioning. He said that as long as he can overpower the guy in front of him, he will continue to play.\n\n“I made a joke the other day in the weight room,” Reed said. “Now I got that grown-man strong, that dance strength.”\n\nReed said Seattle’s defense is united. That included arriving to the Super Bowl’s Opening Night media session as a unit in the same ride.\n\n“One thing I said (Monday) is that Bus 3 is the defensive bus, like, nobody gets on Bus 3 but the defense. We’re just like brothers out there. We trust each other on the field. We know where each player is going to be on the field. We play off of each other, and that connection started outside the locker room.”\n\nReed added, “We hang together a lot, a real close-knit group.”\n\nHow does a man last this long in the pit? Money is a great motivator, to be certain, and so is the zest to compete.\n\n“Just the love of the game,” Reed said. “And definitely everybody’s playing to get to the Super Bowl. Man, I love the game. It’s done a lot for me. I’ve been playing since I was a kid, five years old, and 33 now, and I’ve got a lot of football left.”\n\nReed said he had a sense he could make quite a living in this sport by the time he arrived at Alabama, among the college football programs that annually churn out NFL prospects.\n\n“I figured that I could really make this thing work and make this a great life, a life goal, a life-changing experience,” Reed said.\n\nBecoming a father was also a life-changing experience, Reed said. His oldest daughter, Jacey, was born shortly before he was drafted in 2016, when he would make FaceTime video calls with his infant girl who perked up at the sound of his voice.\n\nNow 10 years old, Jacey doesn’t hesitate to climb over her father at home, even if his body aches from the rigors of a game. She has a sister who also jumps aboard Mount Papa. This isn’t trench warfare, not with the girls giggling and their father rolling on his back and side in preparation for a kid ambush.\n\n“My daughters are amazing,” Reed said with a smile. “Look, I’m their jungle gym. They love crawling all over their dad. I really don’t mind. And it doesn’t stop them (if I’m sore or not).”",

    "fullText": "Arlington (Texas) Mansfield Timberview three-star wide receiver Trysten Shaw announced on Tuesday evening that he has decommitted from UCLA.\n\nShaw was pledged to the Bruins since Aug. 20 and originally stayed locked in despite the departure of head coach DeShaun Foster. He even returned to Westwood over the weekend for a junior day visit and reaffirmed his pledge. He’s now opted to re-open his process between his junior and senior seasons.\n\n“After a long thought and prayer with my family, I have decided to decommit and reopen my recruitment. Thank you UCLA for the opportunity,” Shaw wrote announcing his decision on X.\n\nShaw is the No. 678 overall prospect and No. 94 WR in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 86 player in Texas.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 165-pounder currently holds offers from the likes of Ole Miss, Arkansas, Kansas State, Syracuse, Pitt, Kentucky and a slew of others.\n\nShaw leaves new head coach Bob Chesney and the Bruins with just one commit in the 2027 class. On Monday, UCLA landed a commitment from Temecula (Calif.) Chaparral three-star WR Michael Farinas.\n\n“Honestly I love the culture that coach Chesney is bringing to the program,” Farinas told Rivals’ Greg Biggins. “Coach Chesney is a proven winner and I know he’s going to bring that to UCLA.\n\n“Everyone in the program wants to win and that’s something I want to be a part of. They’re building something special so I’m very excited to be a Bruin.”\n\nFarinas may now be the lone pledge in the UCLA class, but the Bruins’ big junior day weekend has them soaring with top recruits that were in attendance. Biggins has all the latest intel coming out of the weekend as Chesney and Co. look to usher in a new era of football in Los Angeles.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Clippers superstar Kawhi Leonard was considered to be one of the most shocking omission from the 2026 NBA West All-Star roster this season. When the reserve players for both conferences were announced on Sunday, the list did not include Leonard.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Leonard was added to the Western Conference’s roster, according to NBA insider Shams Charania. Leonard is the 16th U.S. All-Star, which is the minimum requirement. The initial group of 24 All-Stars had only 15 U.S. All-Stars.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard has been selected to the 2026 NBA All-Star Game. After the selection of the initial 24 All-Stars, Leonard was added to bring the total number of U.S. All-Stars to 16, the minimum required.\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 3, 2026\n\nLeonard will be a reserve player for the Western Conference alongside the following seven players:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards\n\nDenver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray\n\nOklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren\n\nHouston Rockets forward Kevin Durant\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Devin Booker\n\nPortland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija\n\nThe West Conference starters will be Los Angeles Lakers forward-guard Luka Doncic, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, San Antonio Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokić and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry.\n\nThis is Leonard’s seventh NBA All-Star selection of his career. He is the only Clippers player to have earned an All-Star selection this season.\n\nThe Western Conference is filled with superstars, but Leonard has been one of the top players in the NBA since defeating the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 20. He has led the Clippers out of a 6-21 rut and now the team is 23-26.\n\nAlthough many believed Leonard should have been named an All-Star initially, the two-time NBA champion told reporters he was not expecting to earn the honor after the Clippers’ game against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.\n\n“It’s never an expectation for me. I was a guy that had to work my way into those conversations. It is what it is. I’m gonna enjoy my time,” Leonard said, per Joey Linn on X.\n\nKawhi Leonard last night on his All-Star snub:\n\n“It’s never an expectation for me.

    "fullText": "Winning the Super Bowl and hoisting the Lombardi trophy as confetti rains down has always been considered the stuff of dreams. It’s one of the most coveted championships in all of sports. It’s what children emulate when they organize backyard football games, and Tom Brady is doing his best to remind both Sam Darnold and Drake Maye of that ahead of their respective debuts at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGiven the fact that he’s both won and lost more Super Bowls than most players will ever sniff throughout their careers, it’s safe to say that there’s no better person to humor before venturing into the gridiron’s grandest game than the former New England Patriot. Although it’s just as important to remember that, while confidence and encouragement are key, the hardcold truth is that not everybody can be Brady.\n\n“The reality is that the best team, in a one-game series, doesn’t always win,”he noted to Colin Cowherd during his most recent interview. “In football, you really only have one chance to get it right. That’s the challenge. You could have an off day,” he added.\n\nIn highlighting the Los Angeles Rams’ botched punt against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, Brady suggested that it doesn’t take much to give your opponent “all of the momentum,” and that those moments happen incredibly fast. “That’s how finicky the game is,” he suggested.\n\nWhile it may be a bit funny to hear the most successful signal caller in NFL history refer to his former profession as being “finicky,” it’s also a testament to just how much the Super Bowl means to players. In other words, those being the ones of Brady’s former Super Bowl rival, the star tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce, “Losing a Super Bowl will never make you want to go back and win one.”\n\nIf anything, knowing that you only get one shot at cementing your name in the analogs of American sporting culture makes things that much harder. “That’s why I always think basketball, baseball, a seven-game series, does identify the best team, because you get seven chances to get it right,” Brady suggests.\n\nEven if this eventually proves to be neither Darnold nor Maye’s last Super Bowl appearance, both men are well aware that they won’t get a second opportunity at winning their championship debut. Throw in the fact that both teams feature a top-five defense from a points allowed perspective, and it’s safe to say that both of these quarterbacks know that their margin for error on Sunday will be painfully slim.\n\nThen again, that’s yet another one of the many things that make the Super Bowl the biggest game of the year, and we simply wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe post “You Could Have an Off Day”: Tom Brady Warns Sam Darnold and Drake Maye Ahead of Super Bowl 2015 Rematch appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "The Jaden Ivey era in Detroit is officially over.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons have traded the former fifth overall pick to the Chicago Bulls as part of a multi-team deal that brings Kevin Huerter and Dario Šarić to Detroit. The move signals a clear pivot as the Pistons continue shaping a roster that better fits around Cade Cunningham.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the deal shakes out like this:\n\n2026 first-round pick swap (protected) from Minnesota\n\nA large trade exception and added flexibility\n\nThis trade isn’t about upside anymore, it’s about fit.\n\nIvey’s time in Detroit never quite found stable ground. He was asked to run the offense early when Cade went down, struggled through the Monty Williams season, showed flashes before a serious leg injury, and then returned to a team that had already started to define itself without him.\n\nDetroit didn’t need a blockbuster return. They needed clarity.\n\nThe Pistons are betting that a change of scenery, and playing next to Cade Cunningham, helps Huerter rediscover his shooting stroke. He’s a career 37 percent three-point shooter, offers more size than Ivey, and fits much more cleanly into a spacing-based offense.\n\nDetroit is banking on Huerter getting better shots, not being asked to create them.\n\nŠarić is mostly salary ballast. There’s a very real chance he never plays a minute for Detroit and could be waived as the Pistons sort through roster mechanics and deadline flexibility.\n\nThis move closes the book on a frustrating chapter for both sides.\n\nIvey gets a fresh start with the Bulls.\nDetroit gets shooting, flexibility, and roster clarity.\n\nIt’s not a trade that wins headlines — but it’s one that tells you exactly who the Pistons are building around and how they want to play moving forward.\n\nAnd that matters more than nostalgia.\n\nThe post Detroit Pistons Trade Jaden Ivey, Acquire 2 Players appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "Dusty May didn't hold back while talking about Michigan State on Monday, and also praised Yaxel Lendeborg in a way you just don't hear very often.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Dusty May took to the podium for his scheduled Monday morning availability with the media and touched on several interesting notes. He talked about the transfer portal, his own roster construction, dirty plays at Michigan State and standout Yaxel Lendeborg. No matter what the topic, May nailed it and left everyone with plenty to talk about.\n\nMay doesn’t pretend college basketball is what it was even five or seven years ago. In fact, he embraces the change — even when it means letting go of control.\n\nFrom day one in Ann Arbor, May said the directive has been simple: win now, while still preparing players for whatever comes next. That philosophy explains Michigan’s roster construction, its approach to the transfer portal, and the way the program handles departures.\n\n“I think everyone would rather us just come in and sign a bunch of freshmen and lose and try to grow it organically,” May said. “But our job from day one was to win. And so we brought in a balanced class.”\n\nThat balance extends beyond recruiting rankings. May’s own path — from a Division II athlete to a student manager to a young coach — shapes how he views player movement today. For him, it’s about preparation, not permanence.\n\n“We want to prepare these guys for what’s next,” May said. “We want them to stay as long as they’re committed to doing it together and representing Michigan. But if they choose something different, then we’re not mad at them.”\n\nThat mindset applies even to former Wolverines now wearing different uniforms. May still watches, still cheers, and still keeps in touch.\n\n“They were for us. We were for them. We’re still in each other’s lives,” he said. “It just wasn’t our situation at that time, and we’re okay with it.”\n\nIn a Big Ten where margins are razor-thin, May understands how quickly narratives can flip. One bounce, one shot, one late-game execution can redefine an entire season. That almost happened when Michigan played Penn State in Happy Valley earlier this year. With the Nittany Lions up next on Thursday, May is not taking the matchup lightly.\n\n“If [Freddie] Dilione hits that shot against us, our season may look a little bit different,” he said. “You just keep getting to the next thing.”\n\nThat reality has been evident across the league, from Minnesota’s near-misses to Rutgers’ steady improvement. May stressed that no one is sneaking through the Big Ten anymore.\n\n“Every team in our league has really good players,” he said. “If you think you can take a night off, you’re going to be disappointed.”\n\nMay’s respect for competitiveness also showed up when asked about physical and potentially dangerous plays that took place against Michigan State in East Lansing. While he declined to escalate publicly, he made it clear he values how his team handled those moments.\n\n“I am incredibly proud of our guys for their self-control, their restraint, and their impulse control,” he said. “I’ll leave it at that.”\n\nOne of the players who had to use all of those qualities after being purposely tripped during an aggressive closeout, was Yaxel Lendeborg. He's been at the center of Michigan’s success and embodies everything May wants his program to be about. Despite limited designed touches, the forward continues to dominate within the flow.\n\n“We ran probably one or two plays for him, and he gets 26 and 12,” May said. “There aren’t a lot of guys like that.”\n\nWhat stands out most, though, isn’t the production. It’s the mentality.\n\n“He doesn’t act like a mercenary,” May said. “He acts like he’s completely embedded in our program, our culture, and winning for others.”\n\nFor May, that combination — humility, adaptability, and belief in collective success — is what gives Michigan its edge, no matter how much the sport continues to change.",

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts will retain offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter for the 2026 NFL season.\n\nCooter had interviewed for the New York Giants' offensive coordinator opening, but that position is reportedly going to Matt Nagy.\n\nThe Eagles had also interviewed Cooter for their offensive coordinator vacancy, but that was filled by Sean Mannion.\n\nSo Cooter will remain with the Colts, operating under head coach Shane Steichen.\n\nESPN Sources: Giants are hiring former Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy as their offensive coordinator. pic.twitter.com/Yxh8Z1qXmP\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) February 3, 2026\n\nAlthough Cooter already holds the title of offensive coordinator with the Colts, one likely difference between that role and the Eagles' and Giants' jobs is that those would come with play-calling duties, providing Cooter with a step up in responsibility.\n\nSteichen still had to give Cooter permission to interview for those jobs since going from offensive coordinator to offensive coordinator -- even if there are play-calling duties -- is viewed by the NFL as a lateral move.\n\nThis season, the Colts' offense finished eighth in points per game scored and eighth in yards per play.\n\nThrough the first half of the season, the Colts had one of the most productive offenses in football, with a scheme that was hard to defend.\n\nColts' defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo drew head coaching interest this offseason, interviewing with the Titans and Giants.

    "description": "The Pistons’ trade for Kevin Huerter earns a strong grade as Detroit adds shooting, draft value, and roster clarity at the deadline.",
    "fullText": "At first glance, trading Jaden Ivey for Kevin Huerter doesn’t exactly scream blockbuster.\n\nBut context matters, and when you zoom out, this move looks a lot smarter than it might have a year ago.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons aren’t rebuilding anymore. They’re sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference, playing winning basketball, and operating like a team that knows exactly who it is. That reality changed everything about how Detroit had to approach Ivey’s future.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the deal shakes out like this:\n\n2026 first-round pick swap (protected) from Minnesota\n\nA large trade exception and added flexibility\n\nAs talented as Ivey is, the writing had been on the wall for a while.\n\nHe was coming off a serious injury, staring down restricted free agency, and no longer a natural fit with how the Pistons’ core has gelled around Cade Cunningham. Detroit wasn’t going to re-sign him at a premium — and they also couldn’t afford to spend valuable regular-season reps letting him slowly work his way back into form.\n\nFor a team with real championship aspirations, patience has limits.\n\nSo instead of letting the situation linger or watching Ivey’s value stagnate, the Pistons made a proactive decision.\n\nHuerter isn’t being asked to save the offense or carry a scoring load. That’s important.\n\nHe slides in as a low-usage, high-IQ rotation piece, someone who can dribble, pass, and shoot without hijacking possessions. Even though his three-point percentage dipped this season, his track record suggests that number is far more of an outlier than a trend.\n\nMore importantly, he benefits from playing next to Cade, where clean looks and rhythm shots come naturally.\n\nThis isn’t about upside. It’s about fit and reliability.\n\nThe quiet victory in this deal is the 2026 first-round pick swap.\n\nAs things stand, Detroit would move up multiple spots late in the first round, a meaningful upgrade for a team that’s already built to win now. Turning a player who wasn’t in the long-term plans into both a rotation shooter and draft capital is exactly how contenders operate.\n\nIt’s efficient. It’s disciplined. And it avoids sunk-cost thinking.\n\nThis deal doesn’t solve everything.\n\nDetroit could still use another ball handler. Adding one more versatile forward would help lock in favorite status across the East. And if there’s a bigger swing to take before the deadline, the Pistons should absolutely explore it.\n\nBut as a first move, this checks a lot of boxes.\n\nThe Pistons didn’t chase flash. They chased clarity.\n\nThey moved off a player who no longer fit the timeline, added immediate help, improved their draft position, and kept their championship window intact.\n\nThat’s how good teams stay good.\n\nThe post Trade Grade: Detroit Pistons Ship Jaden Ivey to Chicago Bulls appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox have been looking for an impact bat to add to their lineup after losing Alex Bregman to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nHowever, they have failed to land one yet. They had a rumored interest in Eugenio Suárez and Brendan Donovan, but they are no longer available. They have also been linked to Isaac Paredes in trade rumors, and Houston Astros general manager Dana Brown spoke on Paredes current situation.\n\n“Right now, both of them are still part of our roster and we have plans for both of them to play. Right now, our plan is for both of them to be there,” Brown said when asked if he envisions Paredes and Christian Walker on the team when they get to camp, per The Athletic’s Chandler Rome.\n\nHe did not shut the door on Paredes being traded, but he said the team does have a plan for him and envisions him on the team. Houston may not be too eager to trade him, and may rather trade Walker to have Paredes move back to first base.\n\nIf Paredes is not available, the Red Sox’s options to upgrade are limited. They seem focused on infielders as they look for an impact bat, which makes sense given the surplus of outfielders they already have.\n\nThey could look to trade for Matt Shaw or Nico Hoerner from the Cubs, who could be willing to part with one of them now that they have Bregman.\n\nIf the Red Sox do not add an infielder, Marcelo Mayer figures to start the season at third base with a platoon of Romy Gonzalez and David Hamilton at second base. Kristian Campbell is also an option at second base, but he seemingly needs more time in Triple-A.\n\nRed Sox Reportedly Sign MiLB Reliever, Extend Invite To Major League Spring Training",

    "description": "One NFL analyst provided a piece of offseason advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "NFL.com analyst Kevin Patra has a piece of advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason: re-sign or replace linebacker Devin Lloyd.\n\n\"The Jags seem unlikely to use the franchise tag on Lloyd (projected at $28.2 million, per Over The Cap),\" wrote Patra. \"If he prices himself out of Jacksonville, there will be a gaping hole in the middle of Campanile’s D that needs to be filled.\"\n\nLloyd did a bit of everything for the Jaguars' defense this past season and brought a high-impact presence. When he missed time briefly with an injury during the middle portion of the season, his absence was noticeable.\n\nLloyd finished the season totaling 25 pressures as a blitzer during the regular season, and ranked 11th among linebackers in PFF's run defense grade. In coverage, he recorded five interceptions and two pass breakups.\n\nAs Patra pointed out, the franchise tag won't be an option at that amount. As a free agent, Lloyd is going to garner interest from a number of teams. Spotrac is projecting that he earns a three-year deal worth $60.4 million.\n\nFor a Jaguars team that's a bit short on cap space currently and has other needs to address -- like the defensive line and cornerback -- does Jacksonville have the flexibility to bring Lloyd back at that amount?\n\nIf Lloyd doesn't return, there will certainly be a void to fill in the middle of the Jaguars' defense and no obvious fill-in next to Foye Oluokun.\n\nCurrent on the roster options to potentially take over for Lloyd include Ventrell Miller, Jack Kiser, Yasir Abdullah, and Jalen McLeod.\n\nAddressing this position early on in the draft could be a real possibility for Jacksonville. Anthony Campanile's defensive scheme and his coaching background at the linebacker position may have to be tasked with elevating this unit as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: What Jacksonville Jaguars must accomplish during 2026 NFL offseason",

    "description": "Arsenal 1-0 Chelsea (4-2 aggregate): Kai Havertz’s late strike secured the Gunners’ spot in the League Cup final",
    "fullText": "A long-awaited return. Not just Arsenal's first cup final in six years but – perhaps more importantly to the wider season – another comeback goal from Kai Havertz. Many at the club see him as the difference.\n\nHe made the difference in an otherwise poor match, ending any late tension as he rounded Robert Sanchez in stoppage time to secure a 1-0 victory that was a 4-2 on aggregate, to secure a place in the Carabao Cup final.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side are right to happily celebrate that, in a season that could yet break through all manner of barriers. A second trophy of the Basque’s time, and the first for this specific group of players, is now within sight. They finally have a return to Wembley.\n\nFew will celebrate this individual game, though.\n\nIt used to be said in football that nobody remembers semi-finalists and, whatever the truth of that, few will remember this semi-final. Even one late moment of suspense, which was a Cole Palmer free-kick to feasibly equalise, was delayed and had the drama taken out of it by finicky technicalities.\n\nArsenal, for their part, had done the necessary work in the first leg. Arteta might reasonably claim they should have won that game by three goals, as he pretty much told his players after that match. Liam Rosenior might instead slightly rue the fact that match came so early in his tenure.\n\nNow with a firmer grasp of the tactical shape of his Chelsea squad, his team gave the Premier League leaders a much more measured match. They still couldn’t overcome an initial 3-2 deficit, which Arsenal eventually turned into more.\n\nIf that first leg at Stamford Bridge was a much better match, this second leg was not really the advertisement for the Carabao Cup in the way the competition has enjoyed over the past decade.\n\nThere was until recently a real sense of fun bonus football about it, something that stood out all the \n\nThe fact the Champions League expansion has made the first month of the year also the busiest of the year is probably a significant factor in that.\n\nThe major clubs now just have so much football that there are inevitably going to be drop-offs. You just can’t go full gun in everything, as these two did in the first leg.\n\nThis time, so many attacks ended in such tired ways, with players blazing over. Enzo Fernandez did that at least twice.\n\nAbove anything, this entire match was a visual testament to too much football. More is now very much less. But is there also something else?\n\nThis might have been the Carabao Cup, and a knock-out, but it felt like a fairly typical Premier League game right now. It was two very tactical coaches constantly looking to outmanoeuvre each other. This felt more relevant than the actual movement of players like Eberechi Eze or Joao Pedro.\n\nIn other words, a coach-led game, fully systemised pressing football. You could see some of that in Chelsea's tepid late charge. It was like they were playing for a draw when they needed to win.\n\nHence the decisions that felt like they had the biggest effect on the first half were Rosenior initially going with a three-man defence that completely shut out Viktor Gyokeres, and then Arteta responding by bringing Gabriel Martinelli further inside.\n\nChelsea had been warned when the Brazilian broke through once in the first half, Malo Gusto getting back well to block the shot. The best that Rosenior’s side had in response was a Fernandez long-range effort that Kepa Arrizabalaga did well to thump away.\n\nOtherwise, the main moment of intrigue was Chelsea opting to place three players as far back as the halfway line for an Arsenal corner, intentionally dragging away some of the bodies that cause opposition sides such chaos in these set-pieces. Jurrien Timber still went close.\n\nWhile there has been a certain cynicism about how Rosenior can speak off the pitch, it’s been hard to criticise the action on the pitch – specifically how proactive he has been.\n\nThis is a coach who clearly enjoys solving tactical problems. That was seen away to Antonio Conte’s Napoli and in a home derby against West Ham United, where testing deficits were turned into convincing 3-2 victories.\n\nBoth came from changes of personnel and formation.\n\nRosenior here seemed intent on springing a trap on Arsenal, as Cole Palmer and Estevao were introduced in the second half to greatly change the emphasis of play. But was he just too clever? Was this a bit far, where they ended up playing for tactical security rather than the win they needed?\n\nThe gambit of Liam Delap on the right wing hadn’t worked, admittedly. He spent most of his time on the pitch running into a hard Arsenal defensive wall. Palmer still doesn’t look at his best, though, as emphasised with that late free-kick. Worse, there wasn't exactly much energy to their late push, the one time the emotion of the game rose above the temperate.\n\nArteta had responded with his own major switch, as Viktor Gyokeres was brought off for Havertz, the German receiving loud cheers as he continues to return to full fitness.\n\nThere are many at Arsenal who believe he could be the real difference-maker not just in a title run-in, but potentially even winning multiple trophies.\n\nThey just have to go and win one first. Havertz has duly put them within sight.",

    "description": "Paying homage to the long-dead Transcendentalist, some people are building full-scale replicas of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden cabin.",
    "fullText": "For this story, Dorie read “Walden” for the first time since high school.\n\nJasper and Satchel Sieniewicz can’t believe it was a one man job.\n\nAs children, their father read to them from Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” which includes lengthy descriptions of Thoreau building his cabin at the eponymous pond in Concord, Mass., using hand tools to form beams from fallen timber and upcycling wood from a fisherman’s shanty. All of it he did alone except for raising the frame with a few friends, though even this Thoreau qualifies as “rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any necessity.”\n\nAfter building a full-scale replica of Thoreau’s cabin in the woods behind their family’s vacation home in Maine, the brothers don’t buy it. Even using a saw mill and power tools, it took them three summers of labor, on and off between school and work beginning the first summer of the pandemic, plus the help of their father, Tom Sieniewicz. Thoreau was living in his cabin in under three months.\n\n“There is no way that he did it by himself in the time period that he said it was done,” said Jasper, now 23.\n\nNo registry tallies how many people have made replicas of Thoreau’s cabin, but they exist across the country, built for private use, for writers’ retreats, for academic purposes and as Airbnb rentals. Aiding the projects, The Thoreau Society started selling blueprints of the 10-by-15-foot cabin at their gift shop about seven years ago. And at the Sam Beauford Woodworking Institute in Adrian, Mich., you can (Axe craft gets a week of its own.)\n\nIn 1845, Thoreau moved into his one-room cabin in the woods and proceeded to live there for two years, two months and two days in significant (though not total) quietude, seeking, as he wrote, “to front only the essential facts of life.” He published his account of this experience, “Walden; or, Life in the Woods” in 1854.\n\nToday, it seems quaint to imagine a man so overwhelmed by 19th-century society that he’d seek such extended retreat. There was no electricity back then, no cellphones, no nudifying A.I. chatbots. But Thoreau’s prescription for a life lived more simply, one more attuned to nature, is an enticing response to this unmatched moment of political, social and technological chaos. It’s likely why his legacy has survived so long; perhaps why he’s far more popular a writer today than he ever was in his own life. (The first print run of 2,000 copies of “Walden” took more than five years to sell; it has since been translated into nearly every language spoken on Earth.)\n\nPerhaps it is also why people are building his cabin.\n\nThe Sieniewicz brothers originally hoped to build a treehouse, but the elder Mr. Sieniewicz, an architect, prohibited them from damaging or removing any living trees on the property, prompting a pivot: “I somehow convinced them that building Henry David Thoreau’s cabin was their idea,” he said.\n\nThe boys had visited the site in Concord with their father years prior, but admittedly, the interest in Transcendentalism was mostly his, especially insofar as the philosophy emphasizes individualism, self reliance and a connection to nature. Still, they were game to build the cabin with his blessing, using mostly recycled materials and milling their own wood from fallen trees they found in the forest. “Give a couple teenagers a commercial chain saw, what could happen?” Tom Sieniewicz joked. The boys picked up the new skills they needed by watching YouTube videos; the rest they’d learned as children in woodworking classes.\n\nNot everyone who builds a replica Walden cabin takes as long as the Sieniewicz family because not everyone takes as strict an environmental approach. But like them, most have made it a group effort.\n\nJim and Rachel Van Eerden had a “barn raising” for their cabin in Stokesdale, N.C., with friends building historically accurate furniture, a contractor working on the frame, and even a blacksmith forging nails in the style of the 1850s. Their “Walden” cabin is the first in a growing series of literature-inspired structures on their homestead property, rented out via Airbnb and VRBO. The listing explicitly warns would-be visitors about the lack of plumbing, electricity and Wi-Fi; showers and toilets are available at nearby “Narnia cottage,” instead.\n\nTheir cabin’s interior is nearly true to Thoreau’s model, with even the dents and nicks in the wood desk matching the writer’s own. They made a few additions to the structure though. “We gave ourselves what we called the ‘third year liberty’ where we said, ‘OK, if Thoreau would have stayed a third year, he would have wanted a little front porch. He would’ve wanted a garret,’” said Mr. Van Eerden.\n\nJeffrey Ryan had originally planned to build his cabin solo to mimic Thoreau, but he pivoted after nearly falling from an 8-foot ladder. “That’s when I said, ‘Time out, I’m calling for help,’” Mr. Ryan said. He completed the work on his cabin with the help of a childhood friend, building it in the woods behind his house in Maine. In line with Thoreau’s environmentalist ethos, he sourced used and recycled materials wherever possible — many of the wood beams were leftovers from the construction of his main house, the wood stove was a gift from a neighbor, and the antique windows were purchased on Facebook Marketplace. “I’ve stayed remarkably true to his vision,” he said. He also stayed close to Thoreau’s cost: Mr. Ryan spent $1,670 on supplies. Thoreau spent $28.12½; about $1,200 in today’s dollars.\n\nBut for others, using Thoreau’s exact methods is beside the point. Kevin Klein built his cabin in the woods behind his house in Hingham, Mass. two years ago, tapping his stepfather, a master carpenter, to help. He paid a contractor to put on the roof and spent roughly $4,500 on materials from Lowe’s. “This isn’t a strict, historical fetishization project,” he said.\n\nMr. Klein first became acquainted with Thoreau when he was in high school, watching “South Park.” In a Season 1 episode, Cartman wins a writing contest by plagiarizing “Walden” and Mr. Klein, curious and unfamiliar, bought a copy. It still lives on his bookshelf, and he’s read it multiple times.\n\nEven before “Walden,” critics questioned Thoreau’s motivations for building and moving into his isolated cabin. “I think he touches a lot of nerves,” said Laura Walls, a scholar of American Transcendentalism. “What a lazy bum this guy has to be, not pulling his weight in society and isolating himself like that,” she said, paraphrasing his detractors.\n\nBut for fans of Thoreau, that individualism is the appeal, “the whole idea of leaving society behind and rebelling against industrialization and being self-reliant with hand tools,” said Luke Barnett, whose Sam Beauford Woodworking Institute offers the Walden cabin series. Mr. Barnett was first introduced to Thoreau in fifth grade, bribed with Snickers bars as part of a reading program. “I loved it,” he said, “It’s kind of dry, let’s not lie and pretend it’s not. But the concepts in it attracted me and I reread it every few years.”\n\nAs a child, Mr. Barnett experienced periods of homelessness and came into his woodworking career after dropping out of high school. Though most of his work involves power tools, Mr. Barnett still sees the value in doing things by hand and offers his class to help empower like-minded woodworkers and outdoors people. “With just those tools, they can build anything they could ever imagine. They do not even need electricity,” he said. “Nobody can ever take that away from you. You are completely self reliant.”\n\nIn addition to championing self-reliance, Thoreau was an early environmentalist. Today’s Walden Pond is lush with trees, thanks to a state reservation program, but Thoreau witnessed immense swathes of the forest torn down by loggers. He was among the first to decry the loss, and among the first to question the rampant consumerism which drove its degradation. An Abolitionist, Thoreau avoided sugar, which was produced by slave labor, and he wore simple clothes instead of the new Paris fashions.\n\nTo be an ethical consumer of food, clothes, shelter or even entertainment today is difficult. But a few hours alone in a simple cabin can offer some perspective. Dr. Walls explained, “The whole point for Thoreau was a deliberate experiment in simplifying our wants — what we think we want — and trying to get to the heart of what it means to live a full life.”\n\nSelf reliance doesn’t mean hermitude. It didn’t for Thoreau — while living at Walden, he regularly went into Concord for supplies, visited with friends and ate meals with his family.\n\nBut, he also sometimes needed a break. While at Walden, Thoreau read and wrote, swam in the lake, and spent hours in total stillness, raptly observing nature from his doorway. “I grew in those seasons like corn in the night,” Thoreau wrote of the experience.\n\nFor Mr. Ryan, his cabin offers a peaceful space just for writing. “The simplicity invites focus,” he said. He has just a kerosene lamp, a desk modeled after Thoreau’s and bookshelves full of research material (to avoid using Google). “It naturally makes me not want to check email impulsively. I’m there to write.”\n\nMr. Klein mostly uses his cabin as a quiet place to smoke his cigars. He, his wife and their four children hike in the woods behind their home and will occasionally sleep out in the cabin, using mats and blankets from the house.\n\nThe Van Eerdens only sometimes get to read in their cabin; at about $130 a night, it’s usually booked “We have literally had guests from Germany, from New Zealand, from Paris, from London, all arriving with this excitement about stepping into a book that made a mark on them,” Mr. Van Eerden said. Sometimes the excitement exceeds experience; he’s had to explain to some guests how to start a fire in the fireplace.\n\nJasper Sieniewicz has read some Thoreau, but not as extensively as his father. “I’m sure it’s instilled in me in ways that I probably am not even really aware of,” he said. His father has furnished the cabin authentically, with hard wooden chairs and a desk; if it were up to Jasper, there’d be a couch instead, but he recognizes that his father will be enjoying more time there than he and his brother, who are busy building their careers as engineers.\n\nSatchel did spend the night there a few years back with his then girlfriend. “I honestly would be too scared to stay there alone,” he said.",

    "description": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers",
    "fullText": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers\n\nUltra-processed foods (UPFs) have \n\nUPFs and cigarettes are engineered to encourage addiction and consumption, researchers from three US universities said, pointing to the parallels in widespread health harms that link both.\n\nUPFs, which are widely available worldwide, are food products that have been industrially manufactured, often using emulsifiers or artificial colouring and flavours. The category includes soft drinks and packaged snacks such as crisps and biscuits.\n\nThere are similarities in the production processes of UPFs and cigarettes, and in manufacturers’ efforts to optimise the “doses” of products and how quickly they act on reward pathways in the body, according to the paper from researchers at Harvard, the University of Michigan and Duke University.\n\nThey draw on data from the fields of addiction science, nutrition and public health history to make their comparisons, published on 3 February in the healthcare journal the Milbank Quarterly.\n\nThe authors suggest that marketing claims on the products, such as being “low fat” or “sugar free”, are “health washing” that can stall regulation, akin to the advertising of cigarette filters in the 1950s as protective innovations that “in practice offered little meaningful benefit”.\n\nUltra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts.\n\nUltra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, “mechanically separated meat”, organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed.\n\nUltra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.\n\n“Many UPFs share more characteristics with cigarettes than with minimally processed fruits or vegetables and therefore warrant regulation commensurate with the significant public health risks they pose,” they concluded.\n\nOne of the authors, Prof Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan, a clinical psychologist specialising in addiction, said her patients made the same links: “They would say, ‘I feel addicted to this stuff, I crave it – I used to smoke cigarettes [and] now I have the same habit but it’s with soda and doughnuts. I know it’s killing me; I want to quit, but I can’t.’”\n\nThe debate around UPFs fits a well-worn pattern in the field of addiction, according to Gearhardt. She said: “We just blame it on the individual for a while and say ‘oh, you know, just smoke in moderation, drink in moderation’ – and eventually we get to a point where we understand the levers that the industry can pull to create products that can really hook people.”\n\nWhile food, unlike tobacco, is essential for survival, the authors argue that the distinction makes action doubly necessary because it is difficult to opt out of the modern food environment.\n\nGearhardt said it should be possible to distinguish between harmful UPFs and other foodstuffs in the same way that alcoholic drinks are differentiated from other beverages.\n\nUPFs meet “established benchmarks” as to whether a substance should be considered addictive, the paper argues, with design features that “can drive compulsive use” – although “the harms of UPFs are clear, irrespective of their addictive nature”.\n\nThe authors suggested that lessons from tobacco regulation, “including litigation, marketing restrictions and structural interventions”, could offer a guide to reducing harm related to UPFs, calling for public health efforts to “shift from individual responsibility to food industry accountability”.\n\nProf Martin Warren, chief scientific officer at the Quadram Institute, a specialist food research centre, said that while there were parallels between UPFs and tobacco, the authors risked “overreach” in their comparisons.\n\nThere were questions, he said, over whether UPFs were, like nicotine, “intrinsically addictive in a pharmacological sense, or whether they mainly exploit learned preferences, reward conditioning and convenience”.\n\nHe said it was also important to consider whether the adverse health effects attributed to UPFs came from their contents, or because they replaced “whole foods rich in fibre, micronutrients and protective phytochemicals”. He said: “This distinction matters, because it influences whether regulatory responses should mirror tobacco control or instead prioritise dietary quality, reformulation standards, and food system diversification.”\n\nDr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive of Amref Health Africa, said: “This journal article reinforces a growing public health alarm sounding across Africa [where] corporates have found a comfortable, and profitable, nexus: weak government regulation on harmful products and a changing pattern of consumption.\n\n“All this places new and preventable pressures on already stretched health systems,” he said. “Without publicly led interventions on the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, we risk health systems’ collapse.”",

    "fullText": "Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Tuesday that the chipmaker has appointed a new chief architect to build out graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nThe chips, made by the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, power large language models and have skyrocketed in demand as companies race to build out artificial intelligence infrastructure and data centers.\n\nTan told the audience at the Cisco AI Summit that it took \"some persuasion\" to convince the new executive to join the chipmaker. Tan did not name the new hire.\n\nIntel's stock has rallied over the last year as investors gain optimism about the company's foundry business, but the company is primarily making chips for itself.\n\nOver the past few years, the embattled American chipmaker has fallen behind major semiconductor players that have seen a boost from the AI data center buildout.\n\nEarlier this month, production snags and supply troubles overshadowed the chipmaker's better-than-expected quarterly results. Investors had also been hoping for more clarity on an anchor customer for its foundry segment.\n\nLast year, the company received a wave of big investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia.\n\nTan also discussed the memory chip shortage rattling the technology sector.\n\nRising AI data center demand has created a supply and demand imbalance that's allowed memory chip companies to continue hiking prices.\n\nHe called AI the \"biggest challenge\" for memory and said he expects \"no relief until 2028.\"",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Researchers are sounding the alarm after finding antibiotic resistance genes released from melting Antarctic glaciers.\n\nA study published in the journal Biocontaminant examined the effects of glacial melting on our water supply.\n\nGlaciers serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes, or ARGs, and other microbes. When they are released from the ice, they enter our water systems, posing a major health risk to people downstream.\n\nMillions of people get their water from glacier-fed rivers and lakes. ARGs are strands of DNA that make bacteria more resistant to drugs. When ARGs in meltwater make their way into our water supply, they become a global public health risk.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of viewing glaciers, rivers, and lakes as being part of a \"glacier continuum.\" This means they are an interconnected system rather than separate environments.\n\nFrom our gas-powered cars to overconsumption, human activity has contributed to the production of heat-trapping gases that warm the planet. Rising global temperatures have caused glaciers to rapidly melt, causing elevated sea levels and releasing ARGs.\n\nARGs from melting glaciers are worrisome because they help facilitate the spread of diseases. This threat is compounded by the fact that our growing microplastic problem is also helping antibiotic-resistant bacteria breed. As a result, medicines are being rendered less effective.\n\nOne way we can combat warming temperatures is by making more eco-friendly lifestyle choices. This might include installing solar panels, which can help you slash utility rates and cut energy-related pollution.\n\nTCD's Solar Explorer curates competitive bids from vetted installers, saving you up to $10,000 on installation. EnergySage, a TCD partner, provides a free service that helps people find installers, save thousands, and understand available incentives.\n\nOngoing research into the effects of glacial melt helps us understand and approach the problem of ARGs.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Climate change is reshaping microbial risks in ways we are only beginning to understand,\" study co-author Guannan Mao of Lanzhou University told The Microbiologist.\n\n\"Recognizing glaciers as part of the global antibiotic resistance landscape is an important step toward protecting both environmental and human health.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

And I blame the United States people for this too. They’re getting what they deserve because the last election was simple. You had the choice of the Constitution or the criminal. And for some reason, they took the criminal. So they shouldn’t be surprised at what they’re getting. He’s a convicted sex offender. He don’t pay taxes. Well, you know, he’s a draft dodger. Wouldn’t serve his country, and yet he stands out there and preaches patriotism,” Jesse Ventura said.\n\nSpeaking on the SpinSisters Podcast last week, Ventura floated the idea of Minnesota seceding from the United States and joining Canada after Trump suggested that the Great White North should become a U.S. state.\n\n“I am one that thinks, let me throw this out on your show and we’ll get some headlines. How about since Trump dislikes Minnesota so bad, and we’re so out of control, let’s join Canada?” Jesse Ventura asked.\n\n“Instead of Canada becoming the 51st state of America and lose their healthcare, like they said, they would never do that because they’d lose their healthcare. I’d like to see Minnesota, all of us become Canadians, and make this part of Canada, because it’s obvious Donald Trump don’t want us.”\n\nFans can check out his full comments here.\n\nVENTURA: \"I blame the United States people for this too.

    "description": "Ola Al...",
    "fullText": "Journalists in Gaza have bartered their lives to tell a truth that much of the world still doesn’t want to hear.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nCan you fathom what it means to be a journalist in Gaza? To go months without holding your children simply because their proximity to you may get them killed?\n\nBefore the war began, I worked as an English-language correspondent in Gaza. I sought out mostly stories of success: The ambition that glittered in the eyes of our children, the enduring cultural traditions of the Strip and its landmarks. We were a people worn down by the scarcity of choice. But we were intent on survival, willed toward a better future, souls nourished by hope and by love.\n\nThen, overnight, in October 2023, I was pushed to become a war correspondent. Some of my first reports came from the inside of the emergency room at Al-Shifa Hospital, where I encountered an endless procession of victims. I shuddered through the sound of bombardment and fire belts, shook at the sight of a charred child, a wounded woman, a mutilated boy.\n\nNot long after, the military declared that the north of Gaza had been made into a military zone—and I was forced to make a decision. A car was prepared to take me south where I could continue to report more formally, protected by the purported safety of my press vest and my profession. This would mean leaving behind my home and family indefinitely, their fate wholly unpredictable. But there was another option. I could stay, stand before a camera without any protection, and explain to the world what was happening to us. I told them I wouldn’t leave.\n\nLet me tell you something I’ve never admitted: I knew, in that moment, that the world would betray us. I knew that everything that had come and everything that was yet to come would not be enough to move the people of the world. My heart writhes in pain over what I endured in the north. And yet here I am, after all these long months, still pleading with the world, still proclaiming my belief in your humanity.\n\nSince the beginning of the genocide, Israel has consistently targeted journalists. It has destroyed our images, strangled our voices, and uprooted our words. These transgressions against Palestinian journalists have only one purpose: to allow Israel to carry out its plans in the darkness, granting its military free rein to commit whatever bloody atrocity it desires.\n\nEach of the 245 journalists killed by Israel had a life, a family, a dream, ambitions. Some were waiting for the birth of their child, others were killed having barely known their newborn. My friend, Yahya Sobeih, was murdered hours after he spent an afternoon handing out sweets in celebration of his daughter’s birth. Mohammed Salameh had plans to marry his fiancée, Hala, only days after he was murdered. Death swallows us whole here. One after the other, our colleagues and friends fall like leaves in autumn.\n\nRecall the morning of August 25, 2025: The Israeli army bombed the Nasser Medical Complex. Two strikes in sequence: a “double-tap.” The first claimed the lives of the journalists, civilians, and doctors who had sheltered in the hospital. The second strike anticipated the arrival of rescue teams and other journalists who had hurried towards the site. It was a coordinated crime that unfolded live before the eyes of the world. Twenty civilians were murdered and countless more were wounded—among them, five of my colleagues, including my friend Mohammed Salameh.\n\nHow can this world live with the reality that there exists an entire people whose hospitals are continuously bombed—hospitals that are overflowing with doctors, patients, with those who have been forced to seek refuge inside its walls? Hospitals that hold journalists who have been forced there to document, moment by moment, the realities of brutal, dirty, greedy war? Have our souls really become so cheap?\n\nShortly after the TV channel, Al-Ghad, liv-streamed the second strike on the Nasser Medical Complex, its Gaza correspondent, Ibrahim Qanan, went to Instagram to explain the predictability of these sort of attacks. “Israel possesses highly precise weaponry,” he wrote. “They knew, without a doubt, that members of the Civil Defense were present in the building when it was struck. But, as they see it, there is nobody standing in their way. Israel commits war crimes on a live broadcast simply because they understand that there is nobody in the international community who is willing to confront them.”\n\nJournalism is supposed to be the fourth estate. The safety of its practitioners is considered sacred, even during times of war or conflict. But in Gaza, journalists have been offered no protection. Instead, they’ve been left to die as they broadcast their daily pleas.\n\nRayan El Amine, Jack Mirkinson, and Lizzy Ratner\n\nOur practice has not fundamentally changed since the ceasefire. We journalists continue to report under immense pressure, enduring the psychological strain brought on by repeated military attacks. Our psyches are now more familiar with war than with peace.\n\nHere’s how Abdullah Miqdad, Gaza’s correspondent for Al Araby TV, has described our present condition:\n\n“The constant psychological fear for a journalist is that escalation and war could return at any moment. Journalistic life cannot go back to what it was before the war. The nature of coverage has changed. It now encompasses all the catastrophic consequences the war has left behind, expanding how daily life itself is reported and examined.”\n\nAmid this precarity, we continue to offer our bodies as proof that the danger we face is real. So many of us have lost family members. Some of us carry those shrouds with us everyday. Others have already penned our wills, anticipating our death at any moment. At night, we forgo sleep for the company of murder and destruction; we will ourselves towards danger. Atop the rubble, we share images of charred bodies, wading through flesh and the smell of blood.\n\nThis is not heroic: We persist because there is no alternative. We have surrendered even the safety of our own families in order to protect the truth.\n\n“Two years of war have left a permanent mark,” the journalist Ibrahim al-Khalili told me, “We have covered events no human can bear.”\n\nHow can a person return to normalcy after witnessing every intimate detail of this genocide? What might heal such a soul?\n\nPerhaps the greatest lesson we have learned bartering with our lives is that the world is truly unconvinced by our words, unmoved by our images.\n\nEven after all this time, many international news agencies continue to treat our work as if it were unreliable, as if we are witnesses unworthy of believing. The truth of our own murder, our own annihilation, can only be verified if told through a voice that parachutes into our desecrated Strip. Our words, drenched in blood, are insufficient; only foreign journalists can truly tell our story.\n\nIn the thrum of this hypocrisy, seeking to minimize their fiscal liability, most international news agencies have turned to another kind of exploitation. They have replaced official employees with contractors, paid monthly or per report or image, and foregone the legal responsibility that guarantees our protection. Our bodies are sacrificed to protect institutions that don’t even believe us. If these news agencies continue to find prominence without honoring our labor and blood, then surely we are entitled to decide who narrates our story—who carries our cause, who bears our words to the world.\n\nWhen one of our colleagues is martyred, a cloud of grief descends on us all, and our strength falters. We have come to know this profession as a subjugation.\n\nThere is a collective understanding among journalists in Gaza that those who have perished will not be the last, that any one of us could be next. Everyday as I report, I think of my family, of my fate. I wonder if my name will be soon added to the list of martyrs simply because I insist on writing, on recording, on sharing the realities we live through. What is being done to us is a stain on a world complicit in our annihilation. But nothing can be taken from us anymore.\n\nAya Jouda, a field correspondent for Tasnim News, has spent years documenting the siege on Gaza. Her persistence, she said, comes from a belief that “to witness these events is a human, ethical, and national duty.”\n\n“Gaza is not a headline, or a statistical report. It is human lives being annihilated beneath bombardment and blockade,” she said. “Yes, when the outside world shows solidarity, it gives me hope. It’s proof that our voices can reach beyond these borders. But when that solidarity is absent, our sense of betrayal deepens and with it, our determination to keep telling the truth, no matter the dangers we face.”\n\nLike my colleagues, I can no longer be stopped. There are days when it feels as though our lives are going to waste; our efforts are pointless, our will to persist misspent. We are sustained, however, by the fragile faith that perhaps, overnight, the world may halt this ruthless war. We await that day with the hope that our lives may one day be lived as they ought to be: in love and in peace.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Feb 3 (Reuters) - Gold and silver prices rebounded sharply on Tuesday after a steep selloff over the previous two sessions, with the bullion on ​track for its biggest daily rise since November 2008 as bargain‑hunters stepped in ‌amid resilient underlying fundamentals.\n\nSpot gold rose 5.2% to $4,906.82 per ounce by 01:31 p.m. ET (1831 GMT), recovering from Monday's low ‌of $4,403.24 but still trading below last week's record high of $5,594.82.\n\nU.S. gold futures for April delivery settled 6.1% higher at $4,935 per ounce.\n\nSilver surged 4.8% to $83.23 an ounce on Tuesday, after a record 27% one‑day decline on Friday and falling a further 6% on Monday.\n\n\"I view the recent losses ⁠as corrective within the long‑term ‌uptrend,\" said Peter Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals. He added many of the fundamentals that have driven gold higher ‍over recent years remain firmly in place.\n\n\"At this point, we are likely to see a period of consolidation, with $4,400 an important support level on the downside and resistance probably around $5,100 on the upside,\" Grant ​said.\n\nPrecious metals retreated sharply over the past two sessions as Kevin Warsh was named ‌the next head of the Federal Reserve, after Chair Jerome Powell steps down in May. Investors expect Warsh to support rate cuts but tighten the Fed's balance sheet. Additionally, the CME Group raised margin requirements on precious metal futures, which further weighed on prices.\n\nDespite the recent volatility, analysts broadly expect the bull market to continue, with the yellow metal likely to ⁠hit fresh peaks later this year.\n\n\"We expect prices to ​resume their longer term rise at a more sustainable ​pace as investors continue to be extremely concerned about economic and political conditions,\" said CPM Group managing partner Jeffrey Christian.\n\nGold is widely regarded as a ‍safe haven and typically ⁠performs well in low interest rate environments.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Monday the closely watched employment report for January would not be released this ⁠Friday due to a partial shutdown of the federal government.\n\nAmong other metals, spot platinum climbed 3.4% to $2,194.05 per ‌ounce, while palladium was up 0.4% at $1,727.03.",

    "description": "There are four things supporting the US stock market's elevated valuation. If any of the key trends reverse, it could threaten gains, Piper Sandler says.",
    "fullText": "As the S&P 500 trades near record highs, Piper Sandler analysts highlight four key supports to valuations, noting that \"a sustained reversal in any of these trends would be a potential risk for the market.\"\n\nDespite some worries on Wall Street that the US stock market is overvalued, the analysts don't expect valuations to move much in either direction in 2026. \"Our view is that multiples stay higher for longer,\" they write.\n\nHowever, Piper Sandler said four factors are propping up elevated valuations, and if any of them break, it could trigger a valuation collapse.\n\nThe analysts note that valuation shouldn't be used as a tool to time the market, but rather a \"condition of the risk perceived by investors.\" Charles Schwab recently underlined this point, noting that while \"valuation is a horrible market-timing tool,\" investors can think of high valuations as a way of knowing if the market is vulnerable to shocks.\n\nHere are the four things that Piper Sandler sees reinforcing high valuations:\n\nCurrent high equity valuations reflect high operating margins, Piper Sandler said. Operating margin growth, which measures the share of sales left after operating expenses, signal improved efficiencies.\n\nHigh margins are largely driven by tech. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk highlighted that in the past 20 years, \"all of the increase in the S&P 500's operating margin has come from tech‑related sectors.\"\n\nAI enthusiasm has not only boosted markets, but is also expected to boost productivity and operating efficiency, supporting high margins. \"Technology is steroids for margins,\" T.Rowe Price global multi-asset head and CIO Sébastien Page said, nodding to the US stock market's historic outperformance compared to global markets.\n\nTight credit spreads mean corporate borrowing costs are low. It refers the \"spread\" between the rates lenders charge companies and a benchmark like Treasury yields.\n\nJanus Henderson Investors' portfolio managers Brent Olson and Tom Ross said that credit spreads could hold tight, highlighting the period of the mid-2000s and late-2010s when spreads hovered near historically low levels. They flagged a strong global economy, additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, corporate bond scarcity relative to government offerings, and updated corporate ratings as reasons spreads should stay tight.\n\nThe \"biggest threat\" to the credit gap, in Janus Henderson Investors' view, is \"some shocking economic data\" signaling a recession or a spike in inflation, which could translate to a Fed rate hike.\n\nOil prices declined in 2025 and, despite seeing an uptick in year-to-date, are still constrained amid forecasts for more supply and uncertain demand.\n\nPiper Sandler compared oil prices to S&P 500 price-to-earnings, to show that relatively low prices support the index's valuation.\n\n\"Lower energy prices have played a key role in recent years in lifting equity multiples,\" the analysts said. They also highlight that low energy costs contribute to real rates feel lower than Treasury yields suggest.\n\nPiper Sandler credits \"waning\" inflation as a support to US equity markets, comparing core personal consumption expenditure data, a measure of inflation favored by the Fed, to market performance.\n\n\"In the post-Covid world, investors have a heightened sensitivity and fear of inflation,\" meaning lower inflation offers a \"boost\" to multiples.\n\nLPL Financial research shows that \"the highest stock valuations have been observed when inflation, represented by the CPI, is lowest, and vice versa.\"",

A spokesperson for Food Bank for New York City confirmed the donation to Business Insider.\n\n\"The activation is the result of months of planning — from securing permits and building out a dedicated retail space to coordinating logistics and nonprofit partnerships — and represents a direct investment in the city where Polymarket was founded and scaled,\" reads a release from the prediction market platform.\n\nKalshi and Polymarket have exploded in popularity over the last year and a half, and the giveaways are likely to raise the companies' profiles and brand recognition even further.\n\nBoth prediction markets have moved to partner with media organizations. Polymarket partnered with the Golden Globes and Dow Jones, while Kalshi has struck deals with CNN and CNBC.\n\nPrediction markets have also faced greater scrutiny from lawmakers, especially after an anonymous Polymarket trader made hundreds of thousands of dollars off a well-timed bet on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's political future, sparking concerns about insider trading.\n\nThat's led some prediction markets to push back, with Kalshi emphasizing that it has rules against insider trading and supports efforts to regulate the practice.\n\nUpdate, February 3, 2026 — This story has been updated to clarify Food Bank of New York's involvement with the Polymarket initiative.",

    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "description": "Up to 50 percent of species—which included 12 bird species and 4 frog species—on Aotearoa’s North Island went extinct before humans arrived",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA New Zealand cave has revealed million-year-old fossils, including 12 ancient bird species and four frog species.\n\nExperts believe the discovery shows how drastically New Zealand’s forest culture has shifted.\n\nResearchers said up to 50 percent of species on Aotearoa’s North Island went extinct before humans arrived.\n\nA spectacular trove of fossils in a discovered in a cave on New Zealand's North Island has given scientists their first glimpse of ancient forest species that lived there more than a million years ago. The fossils represent 12 ancient bird species and four frog species, including several previously unknown bird species. Taken together, the fossils paint a picture of an ancient world that looks drastically different than it does today. The discovery also fills in an important gap in scientific understanding of the patterns of extinction that preceded human arrival in New Zealand 750 years ago.\n\nThe team published a study on the find in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.\n\n“This is a newly recognized avifauna for New Zealand, one that was replaced by the one humans encountered a million years later,” Trevor Worthy, lead study author and associate professor at Flinders University, said in a statement. “This remarkable find suggests our ancient forests were once home to a diverse group of birds that did not survive the next million years.”\n\nThe team located the fossils between two layers of volcanic ash preserved in the cave, each from a different major eruption, the first 1.55 million years ago and the second 1 million years ago. Many of the species represented among the fossils had already gone extinct by the time humans arrived on the island. By extrapolation, the research team estimated that between 33 and 50 percent of all species on the island went extinct during the million years before humans arrived in New Zealand, likely thanks to rapid climate shifts and cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, said Paul Scofield, study co-author and Canterbury Museum senior curator of natural history.\n\nWorthy said that “for decades, the extinction of New Zealand’s birds was viewed primarily through the lens of human arrival 750 years ago. This study proves that natural forces like super-volcanoes and dramatic climate shifts were already sculpting the unique identity of our wildlife over a million years ago.”\n\nOf all the finds, scientists might be the giddiest about discovering a new species of parrot, Strigops insulaborealis, an ancient relative of the iconic Kākāpō, a large flightless parrot known for its heft. The team believes this ancestor may have possessed the ability to fly. By analyzing the fossil discovery, the team noticed the ancient bird had weaker legs than the modern relative, implying the ancestor wasn’t quite the skilled climber as the modern-day Kākāpō. Still, the team said more research is needed to confirm that this ancient bird could fly.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered an ancestor of the modern Takahe, which opens further research into that bird. Fossils of an extinct species of pigeon closely related to the Australian bronzewing pigeons also excited experts.\n\n“The shifting forest and shrubland habitats forced a reset of the bird populations,” Scofield said. “We believe this was a major driver for the evolutionary diversification of birds and other fauna in the North Island.”\n\nScofield said that previous excavations showed life in New Zealand between 20 and 16 million years ago and that by contrast, the new discoveries offer the first evidence of life from 15 million years ago to one million years ago. “This wasn’t a missing chapter in New Zealand’s ancient history,” Scofield said, “it was a missing volume.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Personalized skincare regimes and tailor-made cocktails are all the rage. However, having a signature scent is the cherry on top of a well-coordinated beauty routine. Selecting the right scent is an important task. That's why we interviewed multiple experts who know perfume exceptionally well to lead you in the right direction.\n\nKalliope Amorphous, Perfume Artist at Black Baccara Artisan Perfumes, who has been a perfumer for fifteen years, says some of the major issues people face when choosing the right perfume are a lack of knowledge about perfume notes, not understanding how they work together and change while they are worn, or trying too many perfumes at once and experiencing sensory fatigue, or starting with heavier perfumes before lighter ones.\n\nPerfume notes are the ingredients that make up a fragrance, and they work similarly to notes in music. When multiple notes are combined, they form accords, which give perfumes their unique structure and presence, says Amorphous. \"Base notes are the notes that anchor the fragrance and are the most long-lasting, while top notes are what you will often smell first but they tend to disappear the fastest, and middle notes usually tie the base and top notes together.\"\n\nWith so many perfumes on the market, we made it easier to find the right scent by narrowing down some of the most popular options. You'll also find expert tips and answers to common fragrance questions.\n\nFragrance is personal, so it's all about what your nose fancies, says Stacey Bresnahan, Founder of Laubahn Perfumes. If your nose follows slightly sweet and musky scents, this product is for you as the black opium awakens the senses. The coffee accord and orange blossom are mild, but intense at the same time, and perfect for evenings.\n\nWhen selecting a perfume, you'll likely find the categorizations of floral, gourmand, or woody helpful, says Vincent, \"They can help as a generalized starting point for perfumes you enjoy. I actually tend to find I like Balsamic, Gourmand perfumes, when actually what I tend to purchase and formulate are Floral fragrances.\" Maison Margiela's line of fragrances, under the name REPLICA, is designed to transport you to sense memory and this floral yet sensual fragrance takes you to a sun-filled vacation with notes of bergamot, ylang-ylang, white musks, and coconut milk.\n\nOne of the most practical ways to customize a fragrance is to consider the time and place you'll choose to wear a particular scent, says Dressel. Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille is a warm and spicy scent that is perfect for date night or going out dancing with friends. This reinvention of a tobacco fragrance combines tonka bean, vanilla, and dry fruit accords with sweet wood sap for an elegant, nighttime perfume.\n\nIf you're looking for a fragrance for the office, you can tailor your daytime fragrance towards a lighter variety, points out Dressel. Glossier You is an open ended perfume that grows on you with its slightly sweet heart of a scent that comes from ambrette seeds.\n\nFounded by stylist and digital influencer Chriselle Lim in 2021, PHLUR is a new brand on the scene that has launched multiple viral fragrances. None more intriguing than the cult-favorite Missing Person, a floral musk with notes of sheer jasmine, neroli blossom, and Australian sandalwood that blend into a delicate, almost skin-like scent.\n\nHenry Rose crafts a fragrance after you answer a short quiz about your preferences. It asks your reason to wear a fragrance, whether you want to feel sensual or to make an impression. According to your flavor palette and understanding of what you want the perfume to evoke, it suggests the right fragrance from the entire collection.\n\nIf you're shopping for a special occasion fragrance, you might want to consider perfumes with richer notes that sustain throughout the evening, says Dressel. Byredo's Gypsy Water has a woody aroma. This unisex perfume has an addictive sandalwood, vanilla, and amber blend.\n\nBresnahan's suggestion for choosing the right fragrance is to start by sampling fragrances with a familiar scent and seeing how it smells on you. If you love the scent of flowers, this one is perfect for all occasions as it smells like a floral bouquet of jasmine, freesia, and rose petals enriched by an addictive scent of patchouli and vanilla.\n\nThis seductive perfume has a sparkling, bold floral-woody fragrance. Middle notes usually last way longer than top notes and add more depth to the scent experience, says Bresnahan. With accords of jasmine and May rose, it's a classic fragrance for every age group.\n\nMake a change and select perfumes that make you feel a certain way, says Emma Vincent, perfumer at Lush. \"Could it smell comforting, or uplifting or make you feel confident - is that what you need right now?\" If it's beauty and that joy you want to feel, this optimistic fragrance that smells of thousands of flowers is the right pick.\n\nWhen you want to change things up, Vincent suggests experimenting with layering perfumes. \"Maybe one day I want to wear a confident perfume such as the one I created for Lush called Nero, and I will layer this with my wedding fragrance I made at Lush called Confetti. The perfumes aren't too clashing, and I can have both confidence and comfort at the same time.\" Lush Karma perfume features patchouli, Brazilian orange, and Siberian fir and is a spicy yet relaxing mix.\n\nDressel points out that studies have shown that stimulating our sense of smell has an immediate impact on our mood, which is something to keep in mind as you are searching for your ideal fragrance. Clarins' Eau Dynamisante Treatment Fragrance is the brand's first fragrance and body treatment in one spa-fresh formula that sets out to calm one's nerves.\n\nScents can smell different on two different people for many reasons, says Amorphous, but the main one is body chemistry. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world. A unique blend of magnolia and musk with tangerine, the Fenty Eau de Parfum expresses itself uniquely on each wearer for a one-of-a-kind scent.\n\nAmorphous points out that some people amplify certain notes more than others; often hormones play a part. \"Even how dry one person's skin is compared to another can make a difference in how they experience the perfume.\" Ralph Lauren Romance is a very good choice for people with dry skin as the chamomile oil and Sungoddess rose blend into the skin to last longer.\n\nVincent encourages being bold and daring when purchasing and wearing perfumes. \"Wear them for yourself first and foremost,\" she says. Marc Jacobs' playful fragrance is a comforting floral scent of rhubarb and bright daffodil. However, if you are looking for something a little less pricey, we've tested Dossier perfume, a brand that makes shockingly spot on yet affordable option of brand name fragrances.\n\nEvenings are a great time to go bold and don a perfume that is stronger and more sensual, if that is the feeling that you would like to evoke, explains Dressel. Created by the famous Spanish perfumer Alberto Morillas, Gucci Bloom is a complex tropical floral fragrance that is meant to be overpowering.\n\nSoft and seductive, Armani's My Way is a bright floral bouquet of tuberose and jasmine from India. It opens with a citrus embrace of orange blossom and bergamot meant to remind you of a summer day in a field of strawberries.\n\nZee Field, designer and founder of LOULOU DAMOUR fashions and Parfums, shared with Insider answers to common fragrance questions.\n\nThe easiest way is to research the olfactive pyramid of one to two fragrances you like and dislike. If you don't like the scent of your co-worker's perfume, this valuable information will help you to exclude those specific notes. Then create your olfactive profile.\n\nChoose an Eau de parfum or a perfume with a higher concentration of oils. A high fragrance concentration means there is less alcohol and more essential oils. Check the concentration of perfume oil on the fragrance bottle or packaging such as parfum – 20-40% or Eau de parfum – 15-20%. Make sure your fragrance is not expired.\n\nA perfume lasts up to five years. It expires much faster if not stored in a cool place as it is very sensitive to sunlight or air if left open without the cap on.\n\nThe best time to apply perfume is right after the shower before getting dressed on the chest area, shoulders, and one wrist. This application should be done at about 10 inches away. The spray of the wrist is a good tip. Once dressed, keep the five spray routines; three on the skin, two on your clothes. One behind each ear, one on the back of the neck, one on your front left shoulder, and one on your back right shoulder. Only Eau fraiche or Eau de cologne should be applied to the pulse points of the body.\n\nIt is best to test a fragrance on your skin. The only issue is that you can only test one scent at a time. I like to start with a blotter strip or card. Spray twice downwards, pass the blotter strip through the fragrance cloud, wave under your nose, and inhale. Then, I move on to the skin test. Wash your hands earlier, not just before testing fragrances, and do not apply any hand cream. Spray onto the back of your hand from a distance of four to six inches, and no more than 10 inches depending on the atomizer pump. Start with just two sprays, and leave until the oil dries.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "Disney's decision to tap Josh D'Amaro signals that the company wanted to go with a familiar, friendly face to push ahead into the AI era.",
    "fullText": "After a decade of ups and downs, Disney is picking a familiar, friendly face at the heart of its profit engine to lead the company into a new era.\n\nDisney's board just tapped Parks boss Josh D'Amaro to take over for longtime CEO Bob Iger, starting on March 18. Iger, who plans to retire as CEO for the second time, will remain in an advisor role before stepping aside for good later this year.\n\nAfter a decade marked by strategic changes and a failed succession, Disney is turning to the guy who runs its most reliable moneymaker to navigate a period of massive change in the entertainment industry.\n\nDisney's new CEO has his work cut out for him. The Mouse House's stock has only mustered an 11% gain in the last decade, compared to a more than threefold increase for the S&P 500. And while Disney's parks are gushing cash, the streaming business isn't yet making enough money to offset the steady erosion of the company's ever-fading cable networks.\n\nHowever, D'Amaro appears as well-positioned as any possible Iger successor to lead Disney into the next decade.\n\nNot only is D'Amaro intimately familiar with the company's most lucrative business, but he also seems to have the charm and leadership acumen needed to lead a juggernaut like Disney. That's in contrast to former CEO Bob Chapek, who took over after Iger's first retirement and was known as a gruff, business-minded executive who lacked Iger's high level of charisma.\n\nYet D'Amaro isn't just a likable face. Here are three points about Disney's choice of D'Amaro and what his leadership could mean for the company.\n\nWhile it's still too early to say how D'Amaro might run things, the board's decision to go with a company insider, who happened to be the consensus pick, signals a preference for stability, analysts and leadership experts told Business Insider.\n\nD'Amaro — who turns 55 on February 10 — has been at Disney since 1998. As Disney's experience chairman, D'Amaro oversees the parks division, which has been a financial standout compared to the fast-eroding linear TV business.\n\n\"The company appears to be reorganizing in ways that shore up his shortcomings,\" Pozner told Business Insider, referring to D'Amaro.\n\nDisney didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on its reasoning.\n\nBecause D'Amaro is 20 years younger than Iger, D'Amaro could have a lengthy run in the top job, she said.\n\n\"He's still got a long time horizon in front of him,\" Pozner said. \"This is really planning for the future. And I think that's a great signal about stability.\"\n\nAnalyst Joe Bonner of Argus Research said it's \"hard to really tell much about anyone under that big shadow\" of Iger.\n\nD'Amaro is known among colleagues for being a likable guy who takes selfies with parkgoers.\n\n\"D'Amaro definitely feels like a man of the people,\" Pozner said.\n\nD'Amaro is \"broadly popular\" and known for being approachable, said a Disney ad sales staffer who said they'd been in the same room as D'Amaro but hadn't met him. This person added that the incoming CEO seems \"very well-liked over at Parks\" and added that it's \"always a good sign when people love working for someone.\"\n\nThat affability could help him forge relationships in other divisions of the entertainment conglomerate — and navigate a new course while Iger initially remains on the board.\n\nPozner said D'Amaro's relative youth and his \"flesh-pressing image\" could signal that Disney's board wants to help the company maintain its friendly perception. That matters because of criticisms, for example, that the costs of the theme parks have become out of reach for some families.\n\nThat concern has worried some investors, who wonder how much consumers will be willing to hand over to spend time at the happiest place on earth, Ben Barringer, global head of technology research at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, told Business Insider.\n\nBarringer said that D'Amaro will likely have to develop new skills to match his broader remit.\n\n\"Dealing with Parks people is different from dealing with studio people,\" Barringer said.\n\nIt could help that Walden is staying at the Mouse House in a major role.\n\nD'Amaro will likely also want to work on his influence skills, Barringer said, in part because moving the company through the big upheaval in the entertainment industry won't be easy.\n\n\"Hollywood faces quite a lot of disruption,\" he said. The ascent of AI and Disney's partnership with OpenAI are signs that more change is coming, Barringer said.\n\n\"Embracing the disruptive threat and trying to leverage it is a good way to start,\" Barringer said, referring to AI.",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's financial markets rallied sharply on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashed U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% ​from 50%, a development that investors said lifts a key overhang over the ‌country's stocks, bonds and currency.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50, surged nearly 5%, about 100 points away from ‌its record high hit in January. The rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading. The yield on the country's 10-year benchmark bond declined 5 bps to 6.72%\n\nThe Nifty's rise put it on course for the best one-day gain in five years while the rupee ⁠was on track for its ‌best day since November 2022.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting ‍that India had agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and lower trade barriers on U.S. exports.\n\nIndian stock markets and the rupee have been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington in late August, ​placing them among the worst-performing emerging market assets in 2025, with record foreign investor ‌outflows.\n\nThe trade breakthrough is expected to alleviate the persistent drag, with investors expecting a bounce-back in foreign sentiment and flows into Indian assets.\n\n\"We believe this trade deal announcement should lift a key overhang on Indian equities. Foreign investors who have been net sellers recently might also look to increase their weight to India in light of this announcement,\" said Prashant Paroda, portfolio ⁠manager with AllSpring Global's Intrinsic Emerging Market equities ​team.\n\nThe trade deal is also expected to lift a ​pall of geopolitical uncertainty which had accompanied the U.S.-India trade rift, keeping investors cautious on plowing money into the country.\n\n\"The key tail risk of geopolitical ‍isolation about which investors ⁠were concerned has now been adequately addressed by back-to-back trade deals with the European Union and United States,\" economists at Citi said in a note.\n\nThe breakthrough with the ⁠U.S. comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that ‌is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by ‌value.",

    "description": "The Citadel CEO said that social media has heightened business leaders' fear about publicly addressing political issues.",
    "fullText": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said that CEOs are scared of talking about politics — and sick of yo-yoing between politicians to stay successful.\n\nGriffin said that the US government's new style of direct engagement with corporate America is causing some business leaders to question whether their fortunes will change from one administration to the next, depending on their level of public support.\n\n\"When the US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin said at the Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event on Tuesday.\n\nLeaders, he said, would rather focus on creating value for customers and shareholders than catering to an administration.\n\n\"Most CEOs just don't want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,\" he said.\n\nGriffin criticized current and past administrations for their involvement in corporate America, citing green energy investments under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\n\"We don't need the US government to pretend to be venture capitalists,\" he said.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration took a nearly 10% stake in Intel, a few weeks after the president had called on Intel's CEO to resign, but changed his tune after a White House meeting.\n\nWhen asked why fewer CEOs are speaking out about hot-button political issues, Griffin said they're still reeling from prior years, when companies that involved themselves in what he called the \"woke movement\" were either \"embraced or ostracized\" as a result.\n\n\"That's created a level of fear and apprehension among the corporate CEO class to insert themselves in any publicly facing issues these days,\" Griffin said.\n\nSocial media has, he added, taken apprehension to a fever pitch, since sentiment about a company or its product can catch like wildfire.\n\n\"The power of social media to persuade millions or tens of millions of consumers to make a product choice is really terrifying to corporate executives,\" Griffin said. Recent deadly shootings by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Minnesota have pushed some CEOs, from big names in tech to small business owners, to comment publicly on politics again.\n\nGriffin, one of the GOP's biggest donors, was also asked about whether he has plans to run for public office, Griffin said that he hasn't ruled it out. \n\n\"I'd like to believe at a future point in my life I will be involved in public service,\" adding that it was unlikely in the next few years.\n\nIn terms of others' public service, Griffin praised Trump's pick for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, calling the nomination a \"powerful assertion that the Fed will maintain needed independence in policy decision-making.\"",

    "fullText": "The stock market was hit with a wave of selling on Tuesday as traders dumped some of the market's highest-flying tech names and reacted to a spike in oil prices.\n\nLegal-software stocks were a particularly weak point, with many falling by double digits, after Anthropic unveiled new tools that can track compliance and review legal docs.\n\nOn the tech side, investors have been wary of high valuations for months, and are anxiously watching for signs that the AI trade is under pressure. A rotation into other parts of the market that began at the start of the year accelerated in Tuesday's session.\n\nWhile many of the top tech and AI names in the S&P 500, stocks in other sectors jumped as investors looked for better deals. FedEx stock was up more than 5%, and retailers including Walmart, Target, and Costco rose as much as 2%.\n\nMeanwhile, oil spiked and the Cboe volatility index rose nearly 20% on fresh Middle East tensions after the US said it shot down an Iranian drone.\n\nInvestors fear that higher oil prices could weigh on the US economy by causing renewed upward pressure on inflation. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 2% to about $67.50 a barrel, reflecting an 11% increase from its low in December. US oil prices were also up 2% to about $63.50 a barrel.\n\nThe major indexes sank into the red in the early afternoon, but pared the deepest losses. The Dow clawed back much of its drop of more than 500 points and the Nasdaq ended lower by 1.4% after declining by over 2% during the session.\n\n\"The enthusiasm for AI rolls through peaks and valleys,\" Louis Naveillier, the chairman of Naveillier & Associates, wrote in a note on Tuesday during the tech sell-off. \"These higher energy prices will add to inflation pressure,\" he added of the move higher in oil.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were the big moves in the tech sector:\n\nMega-cap tech stocks have been front-of-mind all week as more companies report results for the fourth quarter. Some tech giants, like Microsoft, plunged as investors continue to express concerns over how much firms are spending on artificial intelligence without a clear outlook for how huge capex will translate into returns.\n\nInvestors had been keeping a closer eye on oil prices this year amid geopolitical tensions between the US and other major crude producers, like Venezuela and Iran. In January, some forecasters were eyeing the possibility of an oil shock, a situation where crude prices jump due to supply disruptions, hurting economic activity.",

But the fight over funding for the Department of Homeland Security is far from over.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a package of funding bills on Tuesday afternoon that will end the four-day partial government shutdown.\n\nIt's still not clear how DHS will be funded in the long run.\n\nFunding for the department runs out on Friday, February 13, and Republicans have yet to agree to changes to immigration enforcement that Democrats are demanding in exchange for supporting the funding.\n\nWithout an agreement, several government agencies will go unfunded, and if no bill to fund DHS passes for a long time, workers could miss paychecks.\n\nIt would also affect other agencies funded by the DHS bill, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Coast Guard.\n\nHowever, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would be impacted less than other agencies. Republicans voted to give $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July.\n\nIn the wake of Pretti's killing, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer laid out three key demands on ICE:\n\nIn a Tuesday statement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries backed up those points, while also calling for an \"end to the storming of sensitive locations like houses of worship, schools, and hospitals.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Republicans will agree to any of those demands, leaving open the possibility that Democrats won't support a future DHS funding bill.\n\nWhile that may not be an issue in the GOP-controlled House, it would allow Democrats to block the bill in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats but 60 votes are required to advance most bills.\n\nThe partial shutdown began on Friday, after Senate Democrats demanded changes to funding for DHS in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of spending bills that funded DHS, along with the Department of Defense, the State Department, the Treasury Department, and other agencies.\n\nSenators came together and agreed to negotiate changes, passing a new version of the spending package that extends DHS funding for only two weeks in order to give time for negotiations.\n\nBut that bill still had to clear the House again, and with the lower chamber not scheduled to come back into session until this week, funding for those agencies ran out at midnight on Friday.\n\nThis shutdown was only partial, affecting fewer parts of the federal government than the 43-day long shutdown that occurred in the fall.\n\nThat's because lawmakers have already passed bills to fund various parts of the government, including the departments that fund SNAP and WIC payments.",

    "fullText": "This story was produced by the Berks County bureau of Spotlight PA, an independent, nonpartisan newsroom. org/newsletters/gooddayberks.\n\nUPPER BERN — The Trump administration has quietly purchased a nearly 520,000-square-foot warehouse in Berks County as it plans to convert such facilities into immigration detention centers across the U.S.\n\nThe warehouse, located at 3501 Mountain Road in Upper Bern Township, was sold to the U.S. government on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for $87.4 million, deed records show. The purchase was recorded on Feb. 2.\n\nSpotlight PA visited the warehouse, which is located about a mile from I-78, on Jan. 15 and witnessed about two dozen individuals touring the exterior of the building. One man who arrived early to the site that day identified himself to a reporter as ICE.\n\nThe property was most recently called the Hamburg Logistics Center, and before that was the site of the Mountain Springs Arena, a county landmark known for rodeos and demolition derbies. It neighbors an Amazon warehouse and the Mountain Springs Camping Resort.\n\nThe building is one of at least 23 that ICE plans to convert into an immigration detention facility, Bloomberg reports. The Berks County warehouse could house up to 1,500 beds.\n\nICE also finalized the purchase of a warehouse in nearby Tremont Township, in Schuylkill County, on Monday, according to a deed. The Tremont property is located less than 300 yards from a daycare center and has already faced fierce resident opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE did not answer any questions about the Berks County warehouse purchase and instead lauded the agency’s targeting of “vicious criminals.”\n\n“Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE has new funding to expand detention space to keep these criminals off American streets before they are removed for good from our communities,” the spokesperson said.\n\nUpper Bern Township’s solicitor said in an emailed statement that community leaders learned about the sale on Monday. They declined to answer questions.\n\n“The township was not involved in this transfer and has not received any applications from either the prior or new owners regarding the future use of the property,” the statement reads. “The township has no further comment on this matter at this time.”\n\nState Sen. Chris Gebhard and Rep. Jamie Barton, Republicans who represent the area, said they have reached out to federal contacts to gather more information on how the Department of Homeland Security plans to use the warehouse.\n\n“Our immediate concerns include the potential loss of property tax revenue for the host municipality, county, and school district, as well as security and perimeter considerations,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement. “We look forward to engaging directly with the appropriate federal officials to address these issues. Once additional information is available, we will provide an update.”\n\nThe property is assessed at $22 million and currently pays $198,286 annually in county property taxes under the current tax rate of 9.013 mils. Combined with Hamburg Area School District and township taxes, the loss of tax revenue from the federal government’s purchase would be about $624,000.\n\nState Sen. Judy Schwank (D., Berks) declined to comment on the warehouse purchase on Monday. In an earlier interview with Spotlight PA, she called the then-potential sale “deeply concerning,” especially given the reports of mistreatment of people detained in ICE facilities. She released a statement about “ICE’s action in Minneapolis” on Jan. 27, shortly after federal agents killed Alex Pretti.\n\n“My concern is, knowing the track record of some of these other facilities located throughout the country, it’s not good,” she said. “I don’t necessarily want to see something like that being housed in our county.”\n\nThe deed finalized on Monday shows the property was sold to ICE by an LLC connected to PCCP, a national commercial real estate equity firm. The firm purchased the warehouse in 2024 for $57.5 million, deed records show.\n\nReached by phone Monday afternoon, PCCP partner Greg Eberhardt — who is the authorized signatory for 3501 Mountain Road Owner LLC on the latest deed — denied knowledge of the property and its sale, and refused to comment further.\n\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Eberhardt said before hanging up on a Spotlight PA reporter. “I’m not making company comments.”\n\nUpper Bern Township is situated on the edge of Berks and Schuylkill Counties, with a population of roughly 1,600 people. The community is mostly white, with only 2.8% of residents identifying as another race, according to the 2020 census.\n\nBridget Cambria, attorney with Aldea, a nonprofit that provides pro bono immigration legal services, said the detention center will have a “disruptive” and “chilling” impact on Berks County’s immigrant community.\n\n“If there are people that live freely and at peace knowing that they do the right thing, they can do their immigration process or stay with their family or figure out a way to legalize their status, they’re going to be more afraid to do that with a giant detention center in their backyard,” Cambria said.\n\nA 2022 study by the Detention Watch Center and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center found that immigrants were more likely to be arrested by ICE in counties with more detention bed-space.\n\nBEFORE YOU GO… If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

    "description": "Musk's memo announcing SpaceX and xAI's merger is full of space jargon. Here's your cheat sheet to bring the wonky language back down to Earth.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been shy about his inner nerd — just look at his SpaceX merger memo.\n\nOver the years, the billionaire has peppered his company communications with sci-fi culture Easter eggs, physics nerd jargon, and enough dad-joke flair to make comedian Nate Bargatze blush.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Musk's latest internal memo — announcing that SpaceX would merge with xAI — leaned into the kind of words and phrases that might cause you to scratch your head.\n\nIt reads less like a conventional corporate M&A announcement and more like a sci-fi manifesto, invoking \"sentient suns,\" orbital data centers, and humanity's destiny among the stars.\n\nForget \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" here is your hitchhiker's guide to Musk's memo.\n\nThe memo opens with a sci-fi banger, the kind of premise you'd find in a Hollywood script: Musk says his new vision for the combined company is to build a \"sentient sun.\"\n\nThe phrase is meant to convey scale. Musk is imagining an AI system so large, energy-hungry, and centralized that it metaphorically resembles a star. Except instead of radiating light and heat, this \"sun\" would beam computer-generated intelligence back to Earth.\n\nIt's a piece of sci-fi shorthand for extremely powerful, solar-fed AI.\n\nThis is where the memo goes full-on science nerd: \"Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization,\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk is referencing the Kardashev scale, a '60s framework created by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev that ranks civilizations by the amount of energy they can harness. A Type I civilization can use all the energy available on its home planet. A Type II civilization can capture the full power output of its star.\n\nHumanity today is generally thought to sit somewhere below Type I.\n\nHere, Musk is proposing to move massive computing infrastructure — the power-hungry data centers popping up in rural America to fuel modern AI — off Earth and into orbit. In other words, data centers in space.\n\nIn space, he argues, those systems could rely on near-constant solar energy. As Musk put it elsewhere in the memo: \"It's always sunny in space.\"\n\nSpaceX essentially wants to build a floating gas station. Here, Musk describes a dedicated tanker-to-ship bot expected to roll out in 2026, per SpaceNews.\n\nRight now, rockets carry all of their fuel right from takeoff. This system would allow the company's spacecraft to optimize for other storage cabins.\n\nMusk is essentially a giant railgun designed to launch cargo into space using electricity instead of rocket fuel. It's reminiscent of an instrument in the 1937 science fiction novel \"Zero to Eighty.\"\n\nSpaceX is imagining building one on Earth's Moon, where lower gravity and the lack of an atmosphere would make it easier to fling materials into space.\n\nMusk ends the memo with a linguistic flourish.\n\nIt isn't the first time Musk has used the phrase. In 2014, he launched a Montessori-style school for children from 3 to 9 with the same name. The school's curriculum focused on STEM learning and problem-solving, according to its mission statement.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Small Business Administration said in a policy note that green card holders won't be allowed to apply for SBA loans, effective March 1.\n\nThe move is the latest by the SBA as it works to tighten loan restrictions and restructure the agency.\n\nLast year, it tightened a requirement that businesses applying for loans must be 100% owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent residents, up from a 51% standard.\n\nIn December, it issued a policy note that said up to 5% of a business could be non-citizen owned. But the current policy rescinds that, as well as making lawful permanent residents ineligible, too.\n\n“The Trump SBA is committed to driving economic growth and job creation for American citizens – which is why, effective March 1, the agency will no longer guarantee loans for small businesses owned by foreign nationals,\" said SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons in an emailed statement. “Across every program, the SBA is ensuring that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to this agency goes to support U.S. job creators and innovators.”\n\nThe SBA doesn’t give out direct loans, except when they’re related to disasters, but it works with lenders to distribute loans to small businesses. The loans typically have better rates than traditional loans.\n\nSmall business advocacy group the Small Business Majority said the move is “a decision that will limit the growth of small businesses and jobs throughout the United States.”\n\n“The latest decision by SBA fails to recognize that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business as native-born U.S. citizens,” said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer. “Given that reality, SBA’s severe restrictions will have a negative impact on small business creation throughout this country for years to come.”",

    "fullText": "The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is investigating the death of fishing boat captain and reality TV star Gus Sanfilippo, who died last week when his vessel capsized in Massachusetts (per CBS News).\n\nSanfilippo was the veteran captain of the Lilly Jean, which operated out of Gloucester, and a cast member on the reality show Nor’Easter Men. He died along with five of his fellow crew members and a NOAA fisheries observer when the 72-foot vessel capsized on Friday night as temperatures dipped to approximately 12 degrees Fahrenheit. The other victims have been identified as father and son Paul Beal Sr. and Paul Beal Jr.; John Rousanidis; Freeman Short; Sean Thierren; and 22-year-old NOAA observer Jada Sammitt, who recently graduated from an environmental biology program.\n\nThe Coast Guard will oversee the investigation from this point on. “The purpose of a Coast Guard investigation is to identify measures that can improve the safety of life and property at sea, not to assign civil or criminal blame,” said Lt. Cmdr. Brett Igo, the USCG Northeast District investigation oversight coordinator. Igo added that the investigation is expected to last several months, and that information will be released to the public as it becomes available.\n\nRescue officials responded to a distress call at around 7 a.m. local time on Jan. 30 roughly 25 miles off the coast of Cape Ann. After officials were unable to make contact with the crew, the Coast Guard issued an emergency alert and sent a helicopter along with a boat crew to the location. Rescuers found one person dead floating amongst debris of the Lilly Jean, though they have not confirmed whose body was found. Search and rescue efforts were suspended the following day after workers had searched a 1,000-square-mile radius and exhausted all efforts. All of the boat's seven occupants were officially declared dead later that day.\n\n“The decision to suspend the search was incredibly difficult,” said Capt. Jamie Frederick, commander of Coast Guard Sector Boston. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all the family members and friends of the lost crew of the Lilly Jean, and with the entire Gloucester community during this heartbreaking time.”\n\nSebastian Noto, a fellow fisherman who worked closely with Sanfillipo, told NBC Boston that he spoke with his friend just hours before his death. “‘I quit. It’s too cold,’” Sanfilippo reportedly told Noto. “He was calm. He just couldn’t do the cold because the air holes were freezing.” “I was about 30 miles east of him,” Noto continued. “We usually work together all the time. We are like glue, man. We give a lot of information back-and-forth.”",

    "fullText": "The post Australia Imported 2,400 Toads to Save Its Crops—Now 200 Million of Them are an Unstoppable Disaster appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nQuick Take\nCane toads were introduced to Australia in 1935 to control sugarcane beetles, but the toads ignore the beetles while decimating the ecosystem they were meant to protect.\nInstead, they became a highly toxic invasive species with no natural predators.\nCane toads threaten many native reptiles, mammals, birds, and amphibians.\nDespite decades of effort, large-scale control of cane toads remains nearly impossible.\n\nIn 1935, native beetles were wreaking havoc on Australia’s sugar cane crops in Queensland. The beetle larvae lived in the soil and chewed on sugarcane roots, stunting growth or killing the plants. Seeking a natural solution to kill the grubs, the Australian government imported cane toads from Hawaii, with the hope that the toads would eat the grubs and save the sugarcane. Unfortunately, the worst-case scenario occurred. The toads did not keep the beetle populations in check. Instead, they became one of Australia’s most destructive invasive species and an ecological disaster.\n\nSugarcane had become a key crop in Queensland in the late 1800s. Settlers found that Queensland’s humid and warm climate was ideal for growing the plant. However, farmers faced a battle with the grubs of native beetles, especially the greyback cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum), as the larvae were eating the roots of the sugarcane and decimating crops. To help the farmers, the government established the Queensland Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES) in 1900.\n\nEntomologists working for the BSES studied multiple methods for controlling the beetles, finally settling on a relatively new science: biological control. At the time, entomologists were experimenting with the new idea of bringing in natural predators to control pests. Thus entered the cane toad.\n\nCane toads (Rhinella marina) are the largest toads in the world. They are opportunistic predators and eat a diet of insects, small animals, plants, and even pet food and garbage. Cane toads grow up to 10 inches long and weigh up to 4 pounds. These massive toads are also highly poisonous, even as eggs and tadpoles. The toads secrete a toxic substance called bufotoxin, which can kill animals that try to eat them and can irritate the skin or burn the eyes of humans who handle them.\n\nAs you can imagine, introducing cane toads to Queensland brought more problems than they solved. Cane toads are native to Central and South America. However, in the 1920s and 30s, they were introduced around the world to control pests. Today, they are considered invasive species in Australia, the Caribbean islands, Hawaii, and Florida.\n\nIn August 1935, the BSES released 2,400 cane toads into sugarcane plantations in Gordonvale, North Queensland. This wasn’t a well-thought-out plan. According to the National Museum Australia, “Remarkably, no studies of the potential impact on the environment had been carried out. Nor had the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations even determined whether the toad would actually eat the cane beetles.”\n\nThe cane toads thrived in the warm environment. However, they did nothing to control the beetles. Today, beetle grubs are controlled on sugarcane farms with the use of soil-based insecticides.\n\nAccording to the Queensland Government, 75 species of Australian crocodiles, lizards, and freshwater turtles are threatened by the toads. Some of the animals that are in danger of dying after they eat a cane toad include Australian monitor lizards, quolls, tiger snakes, and freshwater crocodiles. Many of these animals are designated as threatened species.\n\nA research study showed that native tadpoles suffered mass mortality shortly after the toads were introduced to Queensland. The study found 1,300 tadpoles from 10 different species had died in one season. Birds are also affected by the toads. For example, cane toads eat the eggs and nestlings of the rainbow bee-eater bird. Research has shown that cane toads have caused a third of the bee-eaters’ nests to fail.\n\nFinally, cane toads have an indirect effect on native species by changing the ecosystem when they arrive in an area. The toads have large appetites and eat many insects. Eventually, the invertebrate population begins to dwindle, which reduces the amount of resources for other species. These cascading changes can have broad implications for complex food webs.\n\nCane toads have no natural predators or diseases that threaten them in Australia. In Central and South America, they are kept in check by natural predators that evolved along with them. For example, many South American snakes are either immune or have some level of immunity to the bufotoxin of the cane toad.\n\nAlso, cane toads are opportunistic feeders and will eat just about anything, even pet food and people’s trash. They breed opportunistically, usually during warm and wet conditions, and can reproduce multiple times a year. Females lay 8,000 to 30,000 eggs at a time. To understand how cane toad populations can explode, consider that most native Australian frogs lay around 1,000 to 2,000 eggs in an entire year.\n\nExperts offer ways to control cane toads if they are found in a small area or a small pond. They suggest collecting and disposing of cane toad eggs from the water or humanely disposing of the adult toads. Community groups offer information on how to recognize adult cane toads and humanely remove them from the environment. However, these control measures are only feasible for small areas and cannot be applied to large populations of cane toads.\n\nDespite the challenges, researchers are looking for novel ways to control the toads. Scientists found they can edit a cane toad egg’s DNA to stop it from growing beyond a tadpole. If scientists can find a way to gene-edit large numbers of eggs, they may have found a solution to control the cane toad population’s growth.\n\nIn another study, scientists had success in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in freshwater crocodiles. Some populations of crocodiles in Australia have declined by more than 70% due to poisoning from ingesting cane toads. In the study, researchers placed cane toad carcasses with the toxin removed, but a nausea-inducing chemical was added. While crocodiles at control sites continued to eat and become sick from poisoned cane toads, those at the treatment sites stopped trying to eat cane toads.\n\nAnother project that began as a citizen science initiative involves a tadpole trap design that can catch thousands of tadpoles. And in an effort to protect the Pilbara from the hopping invaders, scientists are looking into ways to prevent the toads from accessing water. Cane toads cannot survive more than a few days without access to water.\n\nThe post Australia Imported 2,400 Toads to Save Its Crops—Now 200 Million of Them are an Unstoppable Disaster appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Immigration officers with guns drawn arrested activists who were trailing their vehicles on Tuesday in Minneapolis, while education leaders described anxiety and fear in Minnesota schools from the ongoing federal sweeps.\n\nBoth are signs that tension remains in the Minneapolis area after the departure of high-profile commander Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol and the arrival of Trump administration border czar Tom Homan, which followed the fatal shooting of protester Alex Pretti.\n\n“There’s less smoke on the ground,” Gov. Tim Walz said, referring to tear gas and other irritants used by officers against protesters, “but I think it’s more chilling than it was last week because of the shift to the schools, the shift to the children.”\n\nAt least one person who had an anti-ICE message on clothing was handcuffed while face-down on the ground. An Associated Press photographer witnessed the arrests.\n\nICE agents are changing their tactics\n\nFederal agents in the Twin Cities lately have been conducting more targeted immigration arrests at homes and neighborhoods, rather than staging in parking lots. The convoys have been harder to find and less aggressive. Alerts in activist group chats have been more about sightings than immigration-related detainments.\n\nSeveral cars followed officers through south Minneapolis after there were reports of them knocking at homes. Officers stopped their vehicles and ordered activists to come out of a car at gunpoint. Agents told reporters at the scene to stay back and threatened to use pepper spray.\n\nHomeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said agents detained the activists because they hindered efforts to arrest a man who is in the country illegally.\n\nA federal judge last month put limits on how officers treat motorists who are following them but not obstructing their operations. Safely following agents “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge said. An appeals court, however, set the order aside.\n\nBovino, who was leading immigration enforcement in Minneapolis and other big U.S. cities, left town last week, shortly after Pretti's death became the second local killing of a U.S. citizen in January.\n\nHoman, who was dispatched to Minnesota to succeed Bovino, has warned that protesters could face consequences if they interfere with officers.\n\nOperation Metro Surge affecting schools\n\nWalz and education leaders held a news conference to say the presence of immigration officers is frightening some school communities. Brenda Lewis, superintendent of Fridley Public Schools in suburban Minneapolis, said she has been followed twice by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since speaking publicly on Jan. 27 and that school board members have had ICE vehicles outside their homes.\n\nLewis, a U.S. citizen, said she has seen SUVs with tinted windows, multiple masked people inside and out-of-state license plates. She goes on neighborhood patrols near schools with a security guard.\n\n“Students are afraid to come to school, parents are afraid to drop them off,” Lewis said. “Staff are coming to work wondering if today will be the day something happens in one of our buildings.”\n\nShe said Fridley, which has Somali and Ecuadorian families, has added security, adjusted drop-off procedures and increased mental health support. Tracy Xiong, a social worker in the Columbia Heights district, said she has been coordinating grocery deliveries to school families and finding volunteers to drive children.\n\nThere was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Department of Homeland Security and ICE about the concerns of educators.\n\nGrand jury seeks communications, records\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday was the deadline for Minneapolis to produce information for a federal grand jury. It is part of a U.S. Justice Department request for records of any effort to stifle the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Officials have denounced it as a bullying tactic.\n\n“We have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, but when the federal government weaponizes the criminal justice system against political opponents, it’s important to stand up and fight back,” said Ally Peters, spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat.\n\nShe said the city was complying, but she didn't elaborate. Other state and local offices run by Democrats were given subpoenas, though it is not known whether they had the same deadline. People familiar with the matter have told the AP that the subpoenas are related to an investigation into whether Minnesota officials obstructed enforcement through public statements.\n\nNo release for man in Omar incident\n\nElsewhere, a man charged with squirting apple cider vinegar on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar will remain in jail. U.S. Magistrate Judge David Schultz granted a federal prosecutor's request to keep Anthony Kazmierczak in custody.\n\n“We simply cannot have protesters and people — whatever side of the aisle they’re on — running up to representatives who are conducting official business, and holding town halls, and assaulting them,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Bejar said Tuesday.\n\nDefense attorney John Fossum said the vinegar posed a low risk to Omar. He said Kazmierczak's health problems weren't being properly addressed in jail and that his release would be appropriate.\n\nOrder for release of 2 men accused of assaulting ICE officer fails to stick\n\nAnother judge ordered the release of two Venezuelan men who were accused of assaulting an ICE officer, but ICE officials quickly took them back into custody.\n\nAlfredo Aljorna and Julio Sosa-Celis are accused of assaulting the officer the night of Jan. 14. Sosa-Celis was shot in the thigh by the officer during the encounter, triggering protests in Minneapolis.\n\nThe officer said he was struck with a broom and snow shovel while trying to subdue and arrest Aljorna after a car crash and foot chase. But the two men deny assaulting the officer. Neither video evidence nor three eyewitnesses supported the officer’s account.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson held a hearing Tuesday at which he rejected the government’s appeal of a magistrate judge’s order for the release of the two men on the criminal charges. Magnuson ruled that they could go free.\n\nBut an attorney for Sosa-Celis, Robin Wolpert, said in an interview that when she went to speak afterward with her client, who had been in the custody of U.S. Marshals, staff told her that ICE had taken him. She said she wasn’t sure why, or what their next steps would be.\n\nAljorna's attorney, Frederick Goetz, said he didn't know why ICE took his client or their next steps either.\n\nRaza reported from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

    "title": "10 Hacks Every AirPods User Should Know",
    "description": "There are hacks for AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and, well, AirPods.",
    "fullText": "Since their initial launch in 2016, Apple has released nine iteration of the AirPods, from the now iconic white earbuds, to the upgraded AirPods Pro, to the the AirPods Max, Apple's pricey take on over-the-ear headphones. Whatever the model, however, these things are meant to be simple: You open the case, tap a prompt on your iPhone, and presto, your AirPods are ready to go.\n\nDespite their ease of use, however, AirPods are packed with features and settings you can adjust to your liking. Here are 10 hacks you should know if you own a pair Apple's headphones, whether standard, Pro, or Max. (A note: Whenever I refer to \"AirPods settings\" in this article, I am generally referring to the options that appear in the first page of the Settings app on iOS and iPadOS, or the System Settings on macOS, when you're wearing your AirPods.)\n\nI've had a few AirPods in my day, and every time I set up a new pair, I turn on \"Off\" mode. That might read strange, but it's a real thing. Depending on your AirPods model, you might have the option to use Noise Cancellation, which, of course, blocks outside noise; Transparency, which pumps in the sounds around you; or Off, which activates neither. This last choice ends up being great for times you want some noise blockage, but want to preserve the battery of your AirPods. Though I can't speak to AirPods 4 With Noise Cancellation, the Pros and the Max do a good job with this without active noise cancellation.\n\nWhile this option is always present when switching noise modes from Control Center, by default, Apple doesn't include it from switching modes from the stem (or the noise control button on the AirPods Max). If you try to switch, you'll only move between Noise Cancellation and Transparency. To include \"Off\" in this list, you'll need to dig into your AirPods' settings. Scroll down to \"Press and Hold AirPods,\" then choose either \"Left\" or \"Right,\" depending on which AirPods you want to adjust. Here, make sure \"Off\" is selected to add it to the noise control rotation.\n\nLike any other tiny tech, your AirPods will go missing eventually. Mine slip out of my pockets all the time, and usually end up on the floor or under couch cushions. In such cases, you can waste your time retracing your steps and calculating the physics of where your AirPods would have landed, or you could use Find My to find them much faster.\n\nFind My has a few ways to locate your missing AirPods. The first is the most obvious: When you open the app and choose the \"Devices\" tab, you'll see your AirPods last-known location on the map. If you left them behind at, say, someone's house, you'll likely see that here, and know to stop looking under your own furniture. But if you're already in the location Find My says your AirPods are, you have two more tools to pinpoint their whereabouts.\n\nFirst, you can use \"Find\" to get step-by-step instructions on where your AirPods are. If you have AirPods Pro 2 or 3, you'll even have an arrow pointing you in their direction. If you still can't find them, you can tap \"Play Sound\" to play a sound out of any loose AirPod. If you have AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3, you can play a sound on the case itself.\n\nAirPods work best with Apple devices, but that doesn't mean they're exclusive. You can connect your AirPods to any device that supports Bluetooth, which gives the headphones some added flexibility. I primarily use mine with my iPhone, Mac, and Apple TV, but I also connect them directly to the TV itself to use them with my PS5. (Sony's console doesn't support Bluetooth audio, for some reason.)\n\nThe thing is, there's no obvious way to connect your AirPods to non-Apple devices. You'd only know if you looked up how to put your particular AirPods model into \"pairing mode.\" This bypasses Apple's usual pairing system, and opens up your AirPods to any available Bluetooth source. Here's how to kick your AirPods into pairing mode:\n\nAirPods 1, 2, or 3, or AirPods Pro 1 or 2: Place your AirPods in the case, open the lid, then press and hold the button on the back for five seconds, or until the light starts flashing white.\n\nAirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 3: Place your AirPods in their case, hold the case next to the Bluetooth device, then double-tap the front of the case. The light should start flashing white.\n\nAirPods Max; Press and hold the noise control button (the longer button) for about five seconds, until the light starts flashing white.\n\nIt's easy to be numb to the current state of technology, but the fact your AirPods can translate conversations on the fly is possibly the best encapsulation of \"we're living in the future\" of any consumer product right now. AirPods aren't the only earbuds that can do this, but if you have AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, you have the power to have a full conversation with someone who doesn't speak the same language you do.\n\nYou can't just find yourself in a situation where you need Live Translation and use it right away, however. Before you can use the feature, you need to download the target language to your iPhone. To start, go to your AirPods' settings, then scroll down to \"Translation (Beta)\" and choose \"Languages.\" Here, you can tap any of the available languages to download them to your iPhone, which currently include Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified), Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional), English (UK), English (US), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain).\n\nNow, when you need it, you can press the stems of your AirPods at once to launch Live Translate. Alternatively, you can open the Translate app, then choose \"Live,\" then choose the language of the other speaker, as well as your own language. As they speak, you'll hear the translation in your AirPods, and see the text of the translation on your iPhone's display.\n\nFor well over a year now, AirPods have been cleared by the FDA as clinical-grade hearing aids. It might take other people some time to catch up to the look, but if you need them, the AirPods you already own can be as valid a choice as dedicated (and expensive) hearing aids—assuming your have AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Pro 3.\n\nIn order to take advantage of this perk, you'll either need to take a hearing test through your iPhone, or upload an audiogram you performed with an audiologist. You'll find these options in your AirPods' settings under \"Hearing Assistance.\"\n\nAdaptive Audio is one of my favorite things about modern AirPods. If you have AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio will either boost or cap external sounds, depending on how loud or soft those sounds are, while still letting you hear everything that's going on around you.\n\nBut if you've been using Adaptive Mode, and don't care for Apple's default sound levels here, you can adjust them to either let in more or less sound. You'll find the option in your AirPods settings under \"Adaptive Audio.\" Here, slide the slider left to block more sound, or right to let in more noise. After a moment, you'll hear the changes take effect, so you can test which setting sounds best to you.\n\nBack in the day, when you actually had to buy a dedicated camera for photography or videography, that device usually came with a remote so you could snap a picture or start recording while the camera was set up on a tripod. While the selfie has largely killed that practice, there are still plenty of times when you'd benefit from a camera remote for your iPhone, especially if you're trying to capture a group shot with no extra photographer, or you want to record a video without physically touching your phone.\n\nIf you have AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3, you can use your earbuds as remote for your iPhone's camera. To set it up, open your AirPods' settings, scroll down, then tap \"Camera Remote.\" You can either choose \"Press Once\" to have a quick press act as a remote button press, or \"Press and Hold\" to have a long-press achieve the same. Note that this will affect how your AirPods respond in other circumstances: If you choose \"Press Once,\" you can't use the stem to control media playback; if you choose Press and Hold, you can't use the stem to activate Siri.\n\n\"Smart\" tech tries to solve problems, but, often, only makes them worse. AirPods' \"Personalized Volume\" is one such example. The problem: When your environment is too noisy, you can't hear your music; and when things suddenly get quiet, your music might be too loud. So, this feature \"intelligently\" adjusts the volume based on how quiet or loud your surroundings are. In theory, that's great; in execution, it's a nightmare. Since I picked up a pair of AirPods Pro 3, I've wondered why my music suddenly gets quiet, or suddenly starts getting louder, without me doing anything to control the volume. If the feature works for you, you can keep it on, but if you're like me, you'll want this off.\n\nTo disable it, head to AirPods settings, scroll down to \"Audio,\" then turn off the toggle next to \"Personalized Volume.\"\n\nYour AirPods are basically fancy Bluetooth headsets. If you're wearing them, and you get an incoming call, you don't need to pull out your iPhone. Instead, you can answer that call by pressing an AirPod stem once. But you might not also know you have the ability to customize other stem controls while on the call. By default, pressing the stem once during a call acts as a mute and unmute switch, while pressing twice ends the call. But you can swap these controls if you want to. You'll find them in your AirPods' settings under \"Call Controls.\"\n\nYou can use the stem of your AirPods to do things like accept incoming calls or dismiss notifications. However, if your hands are full, you can also use your head to do the same. AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 3 support Head Gestures, which lets you nod your head or shake it from side to side to either accept or decline a call, or reply to (or dismiss) a text.\n\nYou'll need to have Announce Calls and Announce Notifications enabled for this feature to work. You'll find those settings in your iPhone's \"Siri\" or \"Apple Intelligence & Siri\" setting pages. Once enabled, you can go to your AirPods' settings, scroll down to \"Head Gestures,\" then enable the toggle to turn on the feature. From here, you can assign the \"Accept, Reply\" and \"Decline, Dismiss\" actions to either a head nod, or a head shake.",

    "description": "Don't click to claim your \"expiring\" rewards.",
    "fullText": "A new phishing campaign identified by Malwarebytes Labs targets AT&T customers with text messages about expiring rewards points. Users are urged to claim their rewards ASAP by clicking the included link, which is actually designed to harvest sensitive personal information.\n\nTargets for this scam have received texts containing a \"Rewards Expiration Notice\" urging them to redeem points in their AT&T account before they are scheduled to expire. The message includes a specific points balance and expiration date along with two \"recommended redemption methods\":\n\nAT&T Rewards Center: [shorturl link]\n\nAT&T Mobile App: Rewards section\n\nAs Malwarebytes discovered, the short link sends users to a https://att.hgfxp[.]cc/pay/, a spoofed website with AT&T branding, headers, menus, and links out to the real AT&T domain. Users are directed to enter their phone number to verify their account, which leads to a screen warning that their points are set to expire. Further down, you can see redemption options, including an Apple Watch Series 9, Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones, and Amazon gift cards.\n\nIn order to claim a reward and arrange delivery, victims are then prompted to enter more personal information—which is transmitted directly to the scammers. Malwarebytes notes that the forms have real-time validation and error highlighting so users are less likely to suspect the fraud.\n\nThis scam relies on social engineering tactics—like a sense of urgency and the fear of missing out—to trick targets into engaging. And while it does have a somewhat believable look and feel as well as a multi-step approach to build user trust, it also has some clear red flags. The text originates from a regular phone number rather than a short code, which is often used for automated messages, and the sender doesn't appear as a recognized AT&T contact. The thread also includes multiple recipients and a generic greeting. (A legitimate message from AT&T will be sent directly to you.)\n\nThen there's the shortened URL that leads to a website not owned by AT&T. While the page has some realistic branding and working links, it also has a number of typos and grammatical and formatting errors. Malwarebytes found that if you click the link on different days, the expiration date on the site changes.\n\nAs always, don't click links in unsolicited texts. AT&T does have a rewards program, but you should go directly to that portal via the web or app to manage your rewards.",

    "title": "What's the Difference Between the 'Surface Web' and the 'Deep Web'?",
    "description": "These are two very different sides to the internet.",
    "fullText": "In 2024, the world wide web was made up of 149 zettabytes of data. That's 149 trillion gigabytes, or 149 billion terabytes—whichever helps you wrap your head around that gigantic number. Suffice it to say, the internet is a big place. It's so big, in fact, that you can't access all of it the same way. There are actually different tiers to the web, and depending on with tier a piece of content you're looking for is on, you may or may not be able to view it—even if you know where to find it.\n\nThat's the crux of the difference between the \"surface\" web, and the \"deep\" web. These are two separate parts of the internet that are also part of the larger world wide web. While these two tiers are quite different, you've visited content on both of them before. In fact, you likely visited both surface web pages and deep web pages today, multiple times, without ever realizing it.\n\nThe surface web, also known as the visible web, is really true to its name: This is the part of the web you can easily access through search engines, as they are indexed by platforms like Google. As a rule of thumb, if you can google it, it's on the surface web. The article you're reading right now is on the surface web, for example. Maybe you found it by searching \"difference between surface web and deep web\" on Google. The same applies to Lifehacker as a whole, as well as articles on websites like Mashable, CNET, and PCMag.\n\nYou likely spend a good amount of your internet time on the surface web, on websites both old and new. Forums like Reddit are largely fully represented on the surface web, as are some Instagram pages. Listings for products you can buy on websites like Amazon and Best Buy are surface web pages. Video platforms like YouTube are very much the surface web, including TikTok—though the experience for the latter is not optimized for web browsers. Legacy websites like AddictingGames (which is still playable in 2026), as well as the site for the 1996 movie Space Jam are the surface web. A lot of the surface web is made of up individual articles, which makes sense, since articles still make up a large amount of search engine results.\n\nLike the surface of the ocean, the surface web is just a fraction of the internet as a whole. Back in 2017, some estimates claimed the surface web made up just 10% of the entire internet. That's still a huge number of websites, which tells you how big the overall web really is.\n\nIf the surface web is everything you can find via Google, the deep web is everything you can't. The deep web is much larger than the surface web, and is compromised of websites that are not readily accessible from search engines or direct URLs. They're often locked away behind authentication. That means you need at least a username and password to access them, and in many cases, they require an additional form of authentication as well. The article you're reading is on the surface web, but the software (content management system, or CMS) we use to write and publish the article is not—our CMS is still a website, but it's not something you can find in a Google search, and even if you knew the direct URL, you wouldn't have access.\n\nIt's the same with the many sites you access that only you have permission to view. Think about something like Gmail: The service's homepage is accessible to everyone, and it's something that pops up when searching \"Gmail,\" but to access your Gmail inbox, you need to log in. Once you do, your inbox is accessible via the website, but it's not like anyone can see it with a URL, and they certainly can't find your inbox from a Google search. It's the same story with your Facebook feed, YouTube account, or your banking information. These are all accessible in your web browser as websites, but you need to log in to view them.\n\nThat's also the case for services and subscriptions. Think about stuff like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO: These are all accessible in your web browser, which means you're streaming the content on individual web pages. But the players on those web pages cannot be accessed from Google, even if the landing pages for a particular show or movie can be. In order to actually watch or listen to the content, you need to sign into your account. That's not the case with all streaming services, of course: Happy Gilmore on Tubi is a surface web page, since it's indexed on Google. Some of the deep web is also made up of pages you'll never see, such as protocols for identifying user accounts and running payments behind the scenes. It's not all paywalled content.\n\nMaybe you've also heard about the dark web, but don't quite know what it is. As such, you might conflate the deep web and the dark web, but the two are not identical. In fact, the dark web is a part of the deep web; it's just the part you can't access with a traditional web browser. In order to access the dark web, you need a specialized browser, like Tor, and knowledge of the unique dark web URLs, which typically end in .onion instead of .com or .org.",

    "title": "YouTube Just Blocked This Popular Hack for Free Background Play",
    "description": "A third-party browser might not be enough to replace a YouTube Premium subscription anymore.",
    "fullText": "For Christmas, I got my husband and myself YouTube Premium, and as much as I hate paying for yet another streaming service, it's pretty dang nice. There's ad-blocking, sure, but there are also other bonuses, like additional playback speed options and audio that continues to play in the background when you lock your phone. However, some users have developed hacks to get a few of these features without a subscription, believing they should be included with the site's free tier rather than being locked behind a paywall. Google's been cracking down on ad blockers for a while, but now it's coming after another common YouTube hack—free background play.\n\nPerforming this hack was simple. In many cases, you simply needed to watch YouTube in a non-Chrome browser (and definitely not the official YouTube app). Samsung Internet, for instance, had free YouTube background play officially built-in, with the company even publishing official tutorials on how to use it. Brave also offered this feature, as did Vivaldi. If your browser didn't support free background play by default, you could also usually find an extension for it.\n\nUnfortunately, according to reporting from Android Authority, the hack no longer seems to work in most cases. Toward the end of January, the site noticed that users across Samsung Internet, Brave, and Microsoft Edge complained that free background play no longer worked for them, even when enabled in their browsers or through an extension. Now Google has responded to a question sent by the publication, confirming that it purposefully broke free background play in third-party browsers, whether enabled in the browser's settings or through an extension.\n\n\"Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all out platforms.\"\n\nWell, dang. I've reached out to Google for additional comment, but it seems the eye of Sauron is upon us. Google is now officially cracking down on more than ad blocking.\n\nThat said, while Google's efforts do seem to be affecting many users, not everyone is unable to access background play without paying. One user said it's now been re-enabled on Brave, and I can confirm that I'm able to access it on Safari with my iPhone using the Vinegar extension.\n\nIt's unclear how long these efforts will remain operational, but at least we've now been able to diagnose a cause. Free YouTube background play didn't break on accident, and that means developers and users will have to be extra crafty to keep the hack alive in the future.",

    "title": "How to Keep Your Gym Gear From Stinking",
    "description": "You clothes don't have to reek, nor does your shaker bottle.",
    "fullText": "Does your gym bag reek? You’re not alone, but it doesn’t have to be this way. With proper care, you can keep your workout gear stink-free. The key is to do yourself a favor and start taking care of everything before it starts to smell. But even if you’ve already let things get bad, I have some tips for you.\n\nI'll get into specifics below, but first, it can help to understand why the gym stink develops on clothing and other items that contact your skin. You sweat into them, but it's not the sweat itself that is the problem. It's the bacteria that feed on your sweat. So you'll need to either get rid of the sweat before the bacteria can grow, or handle your clothes and gear in a way that the bacteria won't be able to grow. (It's the same deal with shaker bottles, except substitute food residue for sweat.) If you take nothing else away from this article, just remember this: for the love of God, rinse everything immediately, or at least air your shit out.\n\nA lot of gym clothes these days are made of synthetic fabrics because they provide stretch or sweat-wicking features to keep us comfortable. The downside is that bacteria can cling to synthetic fibers in a way that makes them nearly impossible to wash off. So it’s important that we don’t let those germ colonies grow in the first place.\n\nThe bacteria I’m talking about are the ones that digest your sweat and skin oils. I know, gross. But that means it’s not the sweat itself that causes stinking, but rather the bacteria that multiply while your sweaty shirt is sitting in the laundry basket.\n\nNip this problem in the bud by rinsing the sweat out of synthetics as soon as you take them off. I do this in the shower, squeezing out each garment and hanging it to dry. A set of extra shower curtain hooks will give you a place to hang them. I put up a basic tension rod in the back of my shower for exactly this reason. If you shower at the gym, squeeze those garments out and roll them up in your towel until you get home.\n\nIf you can't rinse your gym clothes right after wearing, or if you have a whole workday in between your shower and your access to laundry, air your clothes out. Cotton clothes don’t have these problems, by the way. If you wear cotton socks or t-shirts, they can be chucked into the laundry whenever and however you like.\n\nYou may never be able to completely remove the stink, but you’ll have the best luck with detergents that contain enzymes or that bill themselves as being good for “sport” or “performance” fabrics. I’ve had good experiences with both Hex (a detergent) and Lysol laundry sanitizer (which you add to the rinse, like a fabric softener). I use one or the other, not both. Either of these can also be used for a soak: soak your gross clothes in a bucket with the Hex or Lysol laundry sanitizer, and then wash as usual.\n\nAnd for a finishing touch, if you really want to be sure you've gotten the stink out, hang the clothes outdoors (or lay them on a surface, like your deck) on a sunny day. Fresh air helps, and sunlight really does kill some of those stench-producing bacteria.\n\nLook, you can try baking soda or vinegar (not together), but I haven't found those to help. If you want a chemical answer to your problems, just get a bottle of Hex.\n\nWhat about things that can’t be quickly rinsed and dried, like your shoes and the gym bag itself? Or, worse, your neoprene knee sleeves? These items stink up most easily when they stay damp and warm. If you wanted to make a gym bag smell as much as possible, I would tell you to fill it with sweaty gear, lock it in the trunk of your car, forget about it until the next gym day. So if that’s your habit already, stop it. You need to air those suckers out.\n\nIf your bag has a mesh compartment for sweaty gear, make use of it. And if you can tie objects to the outsides of the bag—hanging your shoes by their laces, for example—that will help, too. But ultimately what you really want to do is open up the bag as soon as you get home. I always make sure that if my knee sleeves are deep inside the bag, I bring them up to the top to make sure they can get some air. And my shoes are in a mesh compartment, but if I have an extra minute, I’ll open up that compartment and loosen up the shoes so they get as much air flow as possible.\n\nMost of the things in your gym bag can be washed, but check manufacturer’s instructions for the best methods. For example, SBD says to hand wash knee sleeves with soap or a wetsuit detergent, but not to put them in the washing machine or dry them with heat.\n\nJust as with clothes, another good option is to hang or lay out your items in the sunshine and fresh air for a few hours. Sunlight will kill some bacteria, and a good airing-out never hurts.\n\nAvoid spraying things down with vinegar (I’ve never found this to be effective), rubbing alcohol (degrades some materials, so check with the manufacturer), or vodka (unnecessarily expensive, just buy rubbing alcohol and then see above about why you might not want to use rubbing alcohol).\n\nFinally, we come to the bane of many a gym bro’s existence, the stinky shaker cup. If you leave residue from your protein shake in there—especially a milk-based one, like a shake made with whey powder—it can go rancid, and the smells can seep into the plastic where they may never really go away.\n\nTo prevent this, rinse your shaker cup immediately after you drink the shake. Don’t tell yourself you’ll do it when you get home, because we all know you won’t, and honestly, that's too late anyway. You don’t have to fully wash the cup at this point, just rinse it out in the bathroom sink. Or do what I do, and chug your shake at home, over the sink, and wash the cup while it’s still in your hand.\n\nYour Hail Mary hope is to wash it really well. Use soap and hot water. Soak it for a bit if you like. Scrub all the little nooks and crannies (like where the spout meets its cap) to make sure no residue is left. Air it out to dry for a few days; you can even try the sunlight trick above. But if that doesn’t work, buy a new shaker cup, and treat this one right.",

    "fullText": "The Premier League had its quietest ever winter transfer deadline day as just seven deals were completed on Monday.\n\nNot a single arrival was confirmed until 19:04 GMT - four minutes after the window in the English top flight closed - with Crystal Palace announcing the signing of striker Jorgen Strand Larsen from Wolves in a deal worth up to £48m.\n\nClubs can make signings for up to two hours after the official deadline, as long as a deal sheet is submitted before 19:00 to provide extra time for the necessary paperwork to be completed.\n\nThere were five further deals confirmed after the deadline - among them, Sunderland brought in Ecuador winger Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht in a deal worth £17.5m, while Wolves signed midfielder Angel Gomes from Marseille on loan and replaced Strand Larsen with Adam Armstrong from Southampton for £7m.\n\nThat took the overall spending in the Premier League during the winter window to more than £390m.\n\nLiverpool did agree a deal on deadline day to sign defender Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes, but that move - and the payment of the £60m fee - won't happen until the summer.",

    "description": "Arsenal have moved a step closer to winning their first major silverware since 2020 by beating Chelsea 4-2 on aggregate in the Carabao Cup semi-final.",
    "fullText": "After nearly six years and four failed semi-finals, Arsenal's 4-2 aggregate victory over Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final has put them back into a major final.\n\nIt will be their first under Mikel Arteta since he guided them to FA Cup victory in 2020 - and just their second in his time at the club.\n\nIt was tight, it was tense and it was pretty dull at times but, as Kai Havertz rolled in an injury-time goal to confirm their place at Wembley, the euphoria from fans and players alike at Emirates left you in no doubt about the significance.\n\nIn a match that saw both sides only manage two shots on target each, the Gunners rarely looked troubled as they showed all the qualities that have made them so hard to beat.\n\nThe result means Arsenal will compete in a ninth EFL Cup final when they take on either Manchester City or Newcastle on Sunday, 22 March in the tournament's showpiece match.\n\nShould they face City, it will be a repeat of the 2018 final, won by the Manchester club, when Arteta was part of Pep Guardiola's coaching staff.\n\nHowever, aside from it being an opportunity for Arsenal to gain a measure of revenge for that loss and winning their first League Cup for 33 years, it would also be a step towards changing a few perceptions.\n\nArsenal manager Arteta said: \"There was a special atmosphere inside our stadium. It makes such a difference. We've been waiting a few years to get into this position and we're certainly going to enjoy it [the final].\n\n\"It's the best vitamins that we can put in our bodies because we're playing every three days. But the fact that you worked so hard to achieve those moments and to have these moments together is just magical.\n\n\"You can see the joy, the smile, the energy and everything that works at the club.\"\n\nMidfielder Declan Rice, added: \"We deserve it. The last three or four years we've been at the top of the Premier League, competing and got really close but haven't been good enough.\n\n\"That's why this season we have that extra desire and fire in our bellies to go one step further in every competition. There's a long way to go but to be in a cup final with this club is amazing.\"\n\nFor the last few years, Arteta's Arsenal reign has been a story of near-misses, both in cup competitions and in the Premier League.\n\nNow, just one game away from ending their trophy drought, are the Premier League leaders about to silence accusations of being the 'nearly men' for good?\n\nEx-Arsenal defender Matt Upson told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It has been a few years in the making and there has been a steady build-up to this point for Arsenal. Mikel Arteta has been laying the foundations, building the ethos, and togetherness of the team.\"",

    "fullText": "How do you stop Arsenal causing chaos from set-pieces?\n\nIt's the question everyone keeps asking - but few find an answer.\n\nThe Gunners are Europe's leading force in scoring from set-plays over the past couple of seasons and it has proved to be such a formidable tactic.\n\nStep forward Liam Rosenior and Chelsea, who tried an innovative way of stopping them in their Carabao Cup semi-final second-leg tie on Tuesday night - just days after former Manchester City and Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given had suggested similar on Match of the Day.\n\nWhile it wasn't able to stop the Gunners securing a 1-0 win - and 4-2 aggregate success - to book their place in the EFL Cup final, it might at least have given rivals some food for thought.\n\nJust as Arsenal were about to whip in their two corners, Chelsea sent three players sprinting from defence to attack - forcing the hosts to quickly react and send players back themselves.\n\nMonaco and Crystal Palace have also left players up against Arsenal's set-pieces before - but no team has attempted such a late attempt at forcing Mikel Arteta's men back towards their own half.\n\nPerhaps they had been listening to Given on Match of the Day on Saturday night.\n\nAfter watching Arsenal score from two set-pieces in their 4-0 thrashing of Leeds, he said: \"I wish someone would try something different.\n\n\"Take nothing away from Arsenal, but I see the same set-up every week - Arsenal players loaded at the back and causing carnage. Every set-up is the same.\n\n\"Someone can try something different to stop this brilliant form of attack. What can teams do different to create more space? If they leave three up, Arsenal have to leave at least three, maybe four players back.\n\n\"Then, in the defending box, that leaves a lot more space for the defenders and the goalkeeper. Yes, it leaves more space for the forwards as well, but all those numbers caused so much confusion.\"\n\nSince the start of last season, Arteta's men have scored 53 goals from set-pieces across all competitions - 13 more than anyone else in the Premier League.\n\nAnd Chelsea's tactic - while not enough to secure them a place in the EFL Cup final - at least stopped Arsenal from scoring from a set-play.\n\nEx-Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp was less impressed though.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"I like the plan, but my problem is Enzo Fernandez was left marking Gabriel and he has 10 yards to attack the ball.\n\n\"Chelsea are trying to negate there being too much traffic in the area, which Arsenal try to cause chaos with. They obviously have a plan but if Arsenal have the right delivery, Enzo Fernandez has no chance.\"",

Limiting points to only the top 10 finishers disproportionately harms players who consistently perform at a high level but finish just outside that threshold.\"\n\nIn its statement, the OWGR board said it was awarding points to LIV \"in an effort to reflect the changing landscape of the men's professional game\".\n\nHowever, it added that the points were being restricted to the top 10 finishers because it \"recognises there are a number of areas where LIV Golf does not meet the eligibility standards set out by OWGR\".",
