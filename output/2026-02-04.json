    "fullText": "The arrival of Munetaka Murakami leads to a big clubhouse change originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNot many people had the Chicago White Sox being aggressive this offseason on their bingo cards, but here we are. After years of not doing much, the club made a few splashes that excited the fanbase.\n\nThey struck deals wth pitchers Jordan Hicks, Anthony Kay, and Sean Newcomb while also signing reliever Seranthony Domnguez to potentially be the team's newest closer. They also traded away Luis Robert Jr. for Ronald Acuna Jr.'s brother, Luisangel Acuna.\n\nHowever, the biggest splash came when the team locked in Munetaka Murakami on a two-year, $34 million deal. He is expected to cover first base for the White Sox and should be a large part of their offense. But the question always remains with international players coming to the big leagues. Will the game at this level be too much?\n\nMORE: Former A's pitcher could be the 'x-factor' for the White Sox in 2026\n\nMurakami is a Japanese slugger, playing his career in the NPB up until this point. He is just one of the latest international players to make their way to the big leagues.\n\nBeing so far away from home can take its toll on some players. The White Sox understand this and are doing everything in their power to make their new slugger comfortable.\n\nSo, when Murakami requested the team install a bidet in the clubhouse, they got right on that, per Scott Merkin.\n\n\"One thing that stood out, one thing he did notice is I think we didn't have a bidet in our locker room,\" general manager Chris Getz told MLB.com. \"That's something that's new to him, and we are putting one in. So, it was like, 'Ok, that's new. We can do that.'\"\n\nAnything to make your potential star happy, right?\n\nNow, it would be real gamesmanship if Chicago only added the bidet to their locker room, and not the visiting locker room.\n\nMLB analyst puts the spotlight on Alek Manoah in the Angels rotation\n\nMLB analyst puts pressure on the Royals starting rotation to deliver\n\nReds biggest 'x-factor' sits outside the projected starting rotation\n\nMLB insider puts pressure on Cubs' Cade Horton to continue his success\n\nThe Red Sox projected starting rotation is built to dominate",

    "description": "Jarran Reed is in his second stint with the Seahawks and does not take his path to Super Bowl LX for granted.",
    "fullText": "Jarran Reed earns a living in the pit, the trenches of NFL combat, and this pleases the Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle to no end.\n\nHe is a football lifer, a 10th year veteran of interior clashes and scrums that often decide the winners and losers in a sport rooted in crunching contact. On Tuesday afternoon in San Jose, the 6-foot-3, 315-pound 33-year-old Reed beamed at what he has accomplished, and his journey to Super Bow LX on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium. You can be sure he will have a say in how it all turns out against the New England Patriots.\n\nA native of Goldsboro High School in North Carolina, Reed’s story is a familiar one in the Pacific Northwest. He has reveled at the chance to be a run-stuffer and quarterback chaser since he first slipped on shoulder pads and a helmet. He ground his way through East Mississippi Community College, shoring up his game and his academics, and he starred with the Alabama Crimson Tide on the defensive line.\n\nA second-round draft pick by Seattle in 2016, Reed spent the 2021 season with the Kansas City Chiefs and the 2022 campaign with the Green Bay Packers. He re-signed with Seattle in 2023, signing a $12.8 million deal before having it extended in March to a 3-year package for $25 million.\n\nAll told, Reed has done his share of the heavy lifting in helping propel the Seahawks to the season’s final weekend in the franchise’s 50th year. And it isn’t just warding off blockers and plugging gaps that make Reed invaluable. He is a locker room leader who offers fiery pep talks as a veteran who has seen it all. Coach Mike Macdonald often has Reed address the team after games, anointing the veteran to mentor and inspire one of the NFL’s youngest teams.\n\nReed takes none of his path for granted, not in a sport where change is part of the business. Reed has been too good to supplant, and he said he wants to play several more seasons.\n\n“Oh, not one bit (do I take this for granted),” Reed said. “Everybody’s journey is different. I’m very grateful for this, and it’s taught me a lot. Coming from Goldsboro, North Carolina to East Mississippi, then Alabama...all the roles were there to get me to this moment.”\n\nReed said the Seahawks immediately responded to Macdonald, the defensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens in 2022 and 2023 who was hired as head coach by Seattle before the 2024 season.\n\n“It started early with OTA’s, and we attack the day, attack the week,” Reed said. “Everybody needs to be tackled.”\n\nReed said he enjoys studying game film, be it the linemen he will encounter or the ball carriers the Seahawks are tasked to stop. He said that he is big on preparation, mind and body. He said that he thinks of NFL stars over the years who did not reach a Super Bowl.\n\n“Some greats never made it, never got a chance to experience this,” Reed said. “Man, I’m here, Year 10. I got a national championship in junior college, and at Alabama, and now I’m here to see if we can pull it out in the Super Bowl this week.”\n\nReed has always been country strong and became stronger through strength and conditioning. He said that as long as he can overpower the guy in front of him, he will continue to play.\n\n“I made a joke the other day in the weight room,” Reed said. “Now I got that grown-man strong, that dance strength.”\n\nReed said Seattle’s defense is united. That included arriving to the Super Bowl’s Opening Night media session as a unit in the same ride.\n\n“One thing I said (Monday) is that Bus 3 is the defensive bus, like, nobody gets on Bus 3 but the defense. We’re just like brothers out there. We trust each other on the field. We know where each player is going to be on the field. We play off of each other, and that connection started outside the locker room.”\n\nReed added, “We hang together a lot, a real close-knit group.”\n\nHow does a man last this long in the pit? Money is a great motivator, to be certain, and so is the zest to compete.\n\n“Just the love of the game,” Reed said. “And definitely everybody’s playing to get to the Super Bowl. Man, I love the game. It’s done a lot for me. I’ve been playing since I was a kid, five years old, and 33 now, and I’ve got a lot of football left.”\n\nReed said he had a sense he could make quite a living in this sport by the time he arrived at Alabama, among the college football programs that annually churn out NFL prospects.\n\n“I figured that I could really make this thing work and make this a great life, a life goal, a life-changing experience,” Reed said.\n\nBecoming a father was also a life-changing experience, Reed said. His oldest daughter, Jacey, was born shortly before he was drafted in 2016, when he would make FaceTime video calls with his infant girl who perked up at the sound of his voice.\n\nNow 10 years old, Jacey doesn’t hesitate to climb over her father at home, even if his body aches from the rigors of a game. She has a sister who also jumps aboard Mount Papa. This isn’t trench warfare, not with the girls giggling and their father rolling on his back and side in preparation for a kid ambush.\n\n“My daughters are amazing,” Reed said with a smile. “Look, I’m their jungle gym. They love crawling all over their dad. I really don’t mind. And it doesn’t stop them (if I’m sore or not).”",

    "fullText": "Arlington (Texas) Mansfield Timberview three-star wide receiver Trysten Shaw announced on Tuesday evening that he has decommitted from UCLA.\n\nShaw was pledged to the Bruins since Aug. 20 and originally stayed locked in despite the departure of head coach DeShaun Foster. He even returned to Westwood over the weekend for a junior day visit and reaffirmed his pledge. He’s now opted to re-open his process between his junior and senior seasons.\n\n“After a long thought and prayer with my family, I have decided to decommit and reopen my recruitment. Thank you UCLA for the opportunity,” Shaw wrote announcing his decision on X.\n\nShaw is the No. 678 overall prospect and No. 94 WR in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 86 player in Texas.\n\nThe 5-foot-10, 165-pounder currently holds offers from the likes of Ole Miss, Arkansas, Kansas State, Syracuse, Pitt, Kentucky and a slew of others.\n\nShaw leaves new head coach Bob Chesney and the Bruins with just one commit in the 2027 class. On Monday, UCLA landed a commitment from Temecula (Calif.) Chaparral three-star WR Michael Farinas.\n\n“Honestly I love the culture that coach Chesney is bringing to the program,” Farinas told Rivals’ Greg Biggins. “Coach Chesney is a proven winner and I know he’s going to bring that to UCLA.\n\n“Everyone in the program wants to win and that’s something I want to be a part of. They’re building something special so I’m very excited to be a Bruin.”\n\nFarinas may now be the lone pledge in the UCLA class, but the Bruins’ big junior day weekend has them soaring with top recruits that were in attendance. Biggins has all the latest intel coming out of the weekend as Chesney and Co. look to usher in a new era of football in Los Angeles.",

Leonard's addition brings the total number of U.S. All-Stars to 16, the minimum required.\n\nThere was some backlash online after Leonard, who's averaging a career-high 27.6 points per game, 6.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists and a league-leading 2.06 steals in 36 games played this season.  He's also been as efficient as he's ever been, shooting 49.7%, 39.1% from three-point range and has the fourth-best free throw percentage in the league at 91.3%.\n\nThis will be Leonard's seventh career All-Star selection.\n\nPer the NBA's statement, the All-Star teams will be revealed at 4 p.m. PT Tuesday night on Peacock during the pregame show ahead of the Boston Celtics-Dallas Mavericks game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard selected for NBA All-Star Game",

When the reserve players for both conferences were announced on Sunday, the list did not include Leonard.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Leonard was added to the Western Conference’s roster, according to NBA insider Shams Charania. Leonard is the 16th U.S. All-Star, which is the minimum requirement. The initial group of 24 All-Stars had only 15 U.S. All-Stars.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard has been selected to the 2026 NBA All-Star Game. After the selection of the initial 24 All-Stars, Leonard was added to bring the total number of U.S. All-Stars to 16, the minimum required.\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 3, 2026\n\nLeonard will be a reserve player for the Western Conference alongside the following seven players:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards\n\nDenver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray\n\nOklahoma City Thunder center Chet Holmgren\n\nHouston Rockets forward Kevin Durant\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Devin Booker\n\nPortland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija\n\nThe West Conference starters will be Los Angeles Lakers forward-guard Luka Doncic, Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, San Antonio Spurs forward Victor Wembanyama, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokić and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry.\n\nThis is Leonard’s seventh NBA All-Star selection of his career. He is the only Clippers player to have earned an All-Star selection this season.\n\nThe Western Conference is filled with superstars, but Leonard has been one of the top players in the NBA since defeating the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 20. He has led the Clippers out of a 6-21 rut and now the team is 23-26.\n\nAlthough many believed Leonard should have been named an All-Star initially, the two-time NBA champion told reporters he was not expecting to earn the honor after the Clippers’ game against the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday.\n\n“It’s never an expectation for me. I was a guy that had to work my way into those conversations. It is what it is.

    "fullText": "Winning the Super Bowl and hoisting the Lombardi trophy as confetti rains down has always been considered the stuff of dreams. It’s one of the most coveted championships in all of sports. It’s what children emulate when they organize backyard football games, and Tom Brady is doing his best to remind both Sam Darnold and Drake Maye of that ahead of their respective debuts at Super Bowl LX.\n\nGiven the fact that he’s both won and lost more Super Bowls than most players will ever sniff throughout their careers, it’s safe to say that there’s no better person to humor before venturing into the gridiron’s grandest game than the former New England Patriot. Although it’s just as important to remember that, while confidence and encouragement are key, the hardcold truth is that not everybody can be Brady.\n\n“The reality is that the best team, in a one-game series, doesn’t always win,”he noted to Colin Cowherd during his most recent interview. “In football, you really only have one chance to get it right. That’s the challenge. You could have an off day,” he added.\n\nIn highlighting the Los Angeles Rams’ botched punt against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, Brady suggested that it doesn’t take much to give your opponent “all of the momentum,” and that those moments happen incredibly fast. “That’s how finicky the game is,” he suggested.\n\nWhile it may be a bit funny to hear the most successful signal caller in NFL history refer to his former profession as being “finicky,” it’s also a testament to just how much the Super Bowl means to players. In other words, those being the ones of Brady’s former Super Bowl rival, the star tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce, “Losing a Super Bowl will never make you want to go back and win one.”\n\nIf anything, knowing that you only get one shot at cementing your name in the analogs of American sporting culture makes things that much harder. “That’s why I always think basketball, baseball, a seven-game series, does identify the best team, because you get seven chances to get it right,” Brady suggests.\n\nEven if this eventually proves to be neither Darnold nor Maye’s last Super Bowl appearance, both men are well aware that they won’t get a second opportunity at winning their championship debut. Throw in the fact that both teams feature a top-five defense from a points allowed perspective, and it’s safe to say that both of these quarterbacks know that their margin for error on Sunday will be painfully slim.\n\nThen again, that’s yet another one of the many things that make the Super Bowl the biggest game of the year, and we simply wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nThe post “You Could Have an Off Day”: Tom Brady Warns Sam Darnold and Drake Maye Ahead of Super Bowl 2015 Rematch appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "The Jaden Ivey era in Detroit is officially over.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons have traded the former fifth overall pick to the Chicago Bulls as part of a multi-team deal that brings Kevin Huerter and Dario Šarić to Detroit. The move signals a clear pivot as the Pistons continue shaping a roster that better fits around Cade Cunningham.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the deal shakes out like this:\n\n2026 first-round pick swap (protected) from Minnesota\n\nA large trade exception and added flexibility\n\nThis trade isn’t about upside anymore, it’s about fit.\n\nIvey’s time in Detroit never quite found stable ground. He was asked to run the offense early when Cade went down, struggled through the Monty Williams season, showed flashes before a serious leg injury, and then returned to a team that had already started to define itself without him.\n\nDetroit didn’t need a blockbuster return. They needed clarity.\n\nThe Pistons are betting that a change of scenery, and playing next to Cade Cunningham, helps Huerter rediscover his shooting stroke. He’s a career 37 percent three-point shooter, offers more size than Ivey, and fits much more cleanly into a spacing-based offense.\n\nDetroit is banking on Huerter getting better shots, not being asked to create them.\n\nŠarić is mostly salary ballast. There’s a very real chance he never plays a minute for Detroit and could be waived as the Pistons sort through roster mechanics and deadline flexibility.\n\nThis move closes the book on a frustrating chapter for both sides.\n\nIvey gets a fresh start with the Bulls.\nDetroit gets shooting, flexibility, and roster clarity.\n\nIt’s not a trade that wins headlines — but it’s one that tells you exactly who the Pistons are building around and how they want to play moving forward.\n\nAnd that matters more than nostalgia.\n\nThe post Detroit Pistons Trade Jaden Ivey, Acquire 2 Players appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "Dusty May didn't hold back while talking about Michigan State on Monday, and also praised Yaxel Lendeborg in a way you just don't hear very often.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this week, Dusty May took to the podium for his scheduled Monday morning availability with the media and touched on several interesting notes. He talked about the transfer portal, his own roster construction, dirty plays at Michigan State and standout Yaxel Lendeborg. No matter what the topic, May nailed it and left everyone with plenty to talk about.\n\nMay doesn’t pretend college basketball is what it was even five or seven years ago. In fact, he embraces the change — even when it means letting go of control.\n\nFrom day one in Ann Arbor, May said the directive has been simple: win now, while still preparing players for whatever comes next. That philosophy explains Michigan’s roster construction, its approach to the transfer portal, and the way the program handles departures.\n\n“I think everyone would rather us just come in and sign a bunch of freshmen and lose and try to grow it organically,” May said. “But our job from day one was to win. And so we brought in a balanced class.”\n\nThat balance extends beyond recruiting rankings. May’s own path — from a Division II athlete to a student manager to a young coach — shapes how he views player movement today. For him, it’s about preparation, not permanence.\n\n“We want to prepare these guys for what’s next,” May said. “We want them to stay as long as they’re committed to doing it together and representing Michigan. But if they choose something different, then we’re not mad at them.”\n\nThat mindset applies even to former Wolverines now wearing different uniforms. May still watches, still cheers, and still keeps in touch.\n\n“They were for us. We were for them. We’re still in each other’s lives,” he said. “It just wasn’t our situation at that time, and we’re okay with it.”\n\nIn a Big Ten where margins are razor-thin, May understands how quickly narratives can flip. One bounce, one shot, one late-game execution can redefine an entire season. That almost happened when Michigan played Penn State in Happy Valley earlier this year. With the Nittany Lions up next on Thursday, May is not taking the matchup lightly.\n\n“If [Freddie] Dilione hits that shot against us, our season may look a little bit different,” he said. “You just keep getting to the next thing.”\n\nThat reality has been evident across the league, from Minnesota’s near-misses to Rutgers’ steady improvement. May stressed that no one is sneaking through the Big Ten anymore.\n\n“Every team in our league has really good players,” he said. “If you think you can take a night off, you’re going to be disappointed.”\n\nMay’s respect for competitiveness also showed up when asked about physical and potentially dangerous plays that took place against Michigan State in East Lansing. While he declined to escalate publicly, he made it clear he values how his team handled those moments.\n\n“I am incredibly proud of our guys for their self-control, their restraint, and their impulse control,” he said. “I’ll leave it at that.”\n\nOne of the players who had to use all of those qualities after being purposely tripped during an aggressive closeout, was Yaxel Lendeborg. He's been at the center of Michigan’s success and embodies everything May wants his program to be about. Despite limited designed touches, the forward continues to dominate within the flow.\n\n“We ran probably one or two plays for him, and he gets 26 and 12,” May said. “There aren’t a lot of guys like that.”\n\nWhat stands out most, though, isn’t the production. It’s the mentality.\n\n“He doesn’t act like a mercenary,” May said. “He acts like he’s completely embedded in our program, our culture, and winning for others.”\n\nFor May, that combination — humility, adaptability, and belief in collective success — is what gives Michigan its edge, no matter how much the sport continues to change.",

    "description": "The Pistons’ trade for Kevin Huerter earns a strong grade as Detroit adds shooting, draft value, and roster clarity at the deadline.",
    "fullText": "At first glance, trading Jaden Ivey for Kevin Huerter doesn’t exactly scream blockbuster.\n\nBut context matters, and when you zoom out, this move looks a lot smarter than it might have a year ago.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons aren’t rebuilding anymore. They’re sitting at the top of the Eastern Conference, playing winning basketball, and operating like a team that knows exactly who it is. That reality changed everything about how Detroit had to approach Ivey’s future.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the deal shakes out like this:\n\n2026 first-round pick swap (protected) from Minnesota\n\nA large trade exception and added flexibility\n\nAs talented as Ivey is, the writing had been on the wall for a while.\n\nHe was coming off a serious injury, staring down restricted free agency, and no longer a natural fit with how the Pistons’ core has gelled around Cade Cunningham. Detroit wasn’t going to re-sign him at a premium — and they also couldn’t afford to spend valuable regular-season reps letting him slowly work his way back into form.\n\nFor a team with real championship aspirations, patience has limits.\n\nSo instead of letting the situation linger or watching Ivey’s value stagnate, the Pistons made a proactive decision.\n\nHuerter isn’t being asked to save the offense or carry a scoring load. That’s important.\n\nHe slides in as a low-usage, high-IQ rotation piece, someone who can dribble, pass, and shoot without hijacking possessions. Even though his three-point percentage dipped this season, his track record suggests that number is far more of an outlier than a trend.\n\nMore importantly, he benefits from playing next to Cade, where clean looks and rhythm shots come naturally.\n\nThis isn’t about upside. It’s about fit and reliability.\n\nThe quiet victory in this deal is the 2026 first-round pick swap.\n\nAs things stand, Detroit would move up multiple spots late in the first round, a meaningful upgrade for a team that’s already built to win now. Turning a player who wasn’t in the long-term plans into both a rotation shooter and draft capital is exactly how contenders operate.\n\nIt’s efficient. It’s disciplined. And it avoids sunk-cost thinking.\n\nThis deal doesn’t solve everything.\n\nDetroit could still use another ball handler. Adding one more versatile forward would help lock in favorite status across the East. And if there’s a bigger swing to take before the deadline, the Pistons should absolutely explore it.\n\nBut as a first move, this checks a lot of boxes.\n\nThe Pistons didn’t chase flash. They chased clarity.\n\nThey moved off a player who no longer fit the timeline, added immediate help, improved their draft position, and kept their championship window intact.\n\nThat’s how good teams stay good.\n\nThe post Trade Grade: Detroit Pistons Ship Jaden Ivey to Chicago Bulls appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox have been looking for an impact bat to add to their lineup after losing Alex Bregman to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nHowever, they have failed to land one yet. They had a rumored interest in Eugenio Suárez and Brendan Donovan, but they are no longer available. They have also been linked to Isaac Paredes in trade rumors, and Houston Astros general manager Dana Brown spoke on Paredes current situation.\n\n“Right now, both of them are still part of our roster and we have plans for both of them to play. Right now, our plan is for both of them to be there,” Brown said when asked if he envisions Paredes and Christian Walker on the team when they get to camp, per The Athletic’s Chandler Rome.\n\nHe did not shut the door on Paredes being traded, but he said the team does have a plan for him and envisions him on the team. Houston may not be too eager to trade him, and may rather trade Walker to have Paredes move back to first base.\n\nIf Paredes is not available, the Red Sox’s options to upgrade are limited. They seem focused on infielders as they look for an impact bat, which makes sense given the surplus of outfielders they already have.\n\nThey could look to trade for Matt Shaw or Nico Hoerner from the Cubs, who could be willing to part with one of them now that they have Bregman.\n\nIf the Red Sox do not add an infielder, Marcelo Mayer figures to start the season at third base with a platoon of Romy Gonzalez and David Hamilton at second base. Kristian Campbell is also an option at second base, but he seemingly needs more time in Triple-A.\n\nRed Sox Reportedly Sign MiLB Reliever, Extend Invite To Major League Spring Training",

    "fullText": "NFL.com analyst Kevin Patra has a piece of advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason: re-sign or replace linebacker Devin Lloyd.\n\n\"The Jags seem unlikely to use the franchise tag on Lloyd (projected at $28.2 million, per Over The Cap),\" wrote Patra. \"If he prices himself out of Jacksonville, there will be a gaping hole in the middle of Campanile’s D that needs to be filled.\"\n\nLloyd did a bit of everything for the Jaguars' defense this past season and brought a high-impact presence. When he missed time briefly with an injury during the middle portion of the season, his absence was noticeable.\n\nLloyd finished the season totaling 25 pressures as a blitzer during the regular season, and ranked 11th among linebackers in PFF's run defense grade. In coverage, he recorded five interceptions and two pass breakups.\n\nAs Patra pointed out, the franchise tag won't be an option at that amount. As a free agent, Lloyd is going to garner interest from a number of teams. Spotrac is projecting that he earns a three-year deal worth $60.4 million.\n\nFor a Jaguars team that's a bit short on cap space currently and has other needs to address -- like the defensive line and cornerback -- does Jacksonville have the flexibility to bring Lloyd back at that amount?\n\nIf Lloyd doesn't return, there will certainly be a void to fill in the middle of the Jaguars' defense and no obvious fill-in next to Foye Oluokun.\n\nCurrent on the roster options to potentially take over for Lloyd include Ventrell Miller, Jack Kiser, Yasir Abdullah, and Jalen McLeod.\n\nAddressing this position early on in the draft could be a real possibility for Jacksonville. Anthony Campanile's defensive scheme and his coaching background at the linebacker position may have to be tasked with elevating this unit as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: What Jacksonville Jaguars must accomplish during 2026 NFL offseason",

    "description": "Arsenal 1-0 Chelsea (4-2 aggregate): Kai Havertz’s late strike secured the Gunners’ spot in the League Cup final",
    "fullText": "A long-awaited return. Not just Arsenal's first cup final in six years but – perhaps more importantly to the wider season – another comeback goal from Kai Havertz. Many at the club see him as the difference.\n\nHe made the difference in an otherwise poor match, ending any late tension as he rounded Robert Sanchez in stoppage time to secure a 1-0 victory that was a 4-2 on aggregate, to secure a place in the Carabao Cup final.\n\nMikel Arteta’s side are right to happily celebrate that, in a season that could yet break through all manner of barriers. A second trophy of the Basque’s time, and the first for this specific group of players, is now within sight. They finally have a return to Wembley.\n\nFew will celebrate this individual game, though.\n\nIt used to be said in football that nobody remembers semi-finalists and, whatever the truth of that, few will remember this semi-final. Even one late moment of suspense, which was a Cole Palmer free-kick to feasibly equalise, was delayed and had the drama taken out of it by finicky technicalities.\n\nArsenal, for their part, had done the necessary work in the first leg. Arteta might reasonably claim they should have won that game by three goals, as he pretty much told his players after that match. Liam Rosenior might instead slightly rue the fact that match came so early in his tenure.\n\nNow with a firmer grasp of the tactical shape of his Chelsea squad, his team gave the Premier League leaders a much more measured match. They still couldn’t overcome an initial 3-2 deficit, which Arsenal eventually turned into more.\n\nIf that first leg at Stamford Bridge was a much better match, this second leg was not really the advertisement for the Carabao Cup in the way the competition has enjoyed over the past decade.\n\nThere was until recently a real sense of fun bonus football about it, something that stood out all the \n\nThe fact the Champions League expansion has made the first month of the year also the busiest of the year is probably a significant factor in that.\n\nThe major clubs now just have so much football that there are inevitably going to be drop-offs. You just can’t go full gun in everything, as these two did in the first leg.\n\nThis time, so many attacks ended in such tired ways, with players blazing over. Enzo Fernandez did that at least twice.\n\nAbove anything, this entire match was a visual testament to too much football. More is now very much less. But is there also something else?\n\nThis might have been the Carabao Cup, and a knock-out, but it felt like a fairly typical Premier League game right now. It was two very tactical coaches constantly looking to outmanoeuvre each other. This felt more relevant than the actual movement of players like Eberechi Eze or Joao Pedro.\n\nIn other words, a coach-led game, fully systemised pressing football. You could see some of that in Chelsea's tepid late charge. It was like they were playing for a draw when they needed to win.\n\nHence the decisions that felt like they had the biggest effect on the first half were Rosenior initially going with a three-man defence that completely shut out Viktor Gyokeres, and then Arteta responding by bringing Gabriel Martinelli further inside.\n\nChelsea had been warned when the Brazilian broke through once in the first half, Malo Gusto getting back well to block the shot. The best that Rosenior’s side had in response was a Fernandez long-range effort that Kepa Arrizabalaga did well to thump away.\n\nOtherwise, the main moment of intrigue was Chelsea opting to place three players as far back as the halfway line for an Arsenal corner, intentionally dragging away some of the bodies that cause opposition sides such chaos in these set-pieces. Jurrien Timber still went close.\n\nWhile there has been a certain cynicism about how Rosenior can speak off the pitch, it’s been hard to criticise the action on the pitch – specifically how proactive he has been.\n\nThis is a coach who clearly enjoys solving tactical problems. That was seen away to Antonio Conte’s Napoli and in a home derby against West Ham United, where testing deficits were turned into convincing 3-2 victories.\n\nBoth came from changes of personnel and formation.\n\nRosenior here seemed intent on springing a trap on Arsenal, as Cole Palmer and Estevao were introduced in the second half to greatly change the emphasis of play. But was he just too clever? Was this a bit far, where they ended up playing for tactical security rather than the win they needed?\n\nThe gambit of Liam Delap on the right wing hadn’t worked, admittedly. He spent most of his time on the pitch running into a hard Arsenal defensive wall. Palmer still doesn’t look at his best, though, as emphasised with that late free-kick. Worse, there wasn't exactly much energy to their late push, the one time the emotion of the game rose above the temperate.\n\nArteta had responded with his own major switch, as Viktor Gyokeres was brought off for Havertz, the German receiving loud cheers as he continues to return to full fitness.\n\nThere are many at Arsenal who believe he could be the real difference-maker not just in a title run-in, but potentially even winning multiple trophies.\n\nThey just have to go and win one first. Havertz has duly put them within sight.",

    "description": "Paying homage to the long-dead Transcendentalist, some people are building full-scale replicas of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden cabin.",
    "fullText": "For this story, Dorie read “Walden” for the first time since high school.\n\nJasper and Satchel Sieniewicz can’t believe it was a one man job.\n\nAs children, their father read to them from Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” which includes lengthy descriptions of Thoreau building his cabin at the eponymous pond in Concord, Mass., using hand tools to form beams from fallen timber and upcycling wood from a fisherman’s shanty. All of it he did alone except for raising the frame with a few friends, though even this Thoreau qualifies as “rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any necessity.”\n\nAfter building a full-scale replica of Thoreau’s cabin in the woods behind their family’s vacation home in Maine, the brothers don’t buy it. Even using a saw mill and power tools, it took them three summers of labor, on and off between school and work beginning the first summer of the pandemic, plus the help of their father, Tom Sieniewicz. Thoreau was living in his cabin in under three months.\n\n“There is no way that he did it by himself in the time period that he said it was done,” said Jasper, now 23.\n\nNo registry tallies how many people have made replicas of Thoreau’s cabin, but they exist across the country, built for private use, for writers’ retreats, for academic purposes and as Airbnb rentals. Aiding the projects, The Thoreau Society started selling blueprints of the 10-by-15-foot cabin at their gift shop about seven years ago. And at the Sam Beauford Woodworking Institute in Adrian, Mich., you can (Axe craft gets a week of its own.)\n\nIn 1845, Thoreau moved into his one-room cabin in the woods and proceeded to live there for two years, two months and two days in significant (though not total) quietude, seeking, as he wrote, “to front only the essential facts of life.” He published his account of this experience, “Walden; or, Life in the Woods” in 1854.\n\nToday, it seems quaint to imagine a man so overwhelmed by 19th-century society that he’d seek such extended retreat. There was no electricity back then, no cellphones, no nudifying A.I. chatbots. But Thoreau’s prescription for a life lived more simply, one more attuned to nature, is an enticing response to this unmatched moment of political, social and technological chaos. It’s likely why his legacy has survived so long; perhaps why he’s far more popular a writer today than he ever was in his own life. (The first print run of 2,000 copies of “Walden” took more than five years to sell; it has since been translated into nearly every language spoken on Earth.)\n\nPerhaps it is also why people are building his cabin.\n\nThe Sieniewicz brothers originally hoped to build a treehouse, but the elder Mr. Sieniewicz, an architect, prohibited them from damaging or removing any living trees on the property, prompting a pivot: “I somehow convinced them that building Henry David Thoreau’s cabin was their idea,” he said.\n\nThe boys had visited the site in Concord with their father years prior, but admittedly, the interest in Transcendentalism was mostly his, especially insofar as the philosophy emphasizes individualism, self reliance and a connection to nature. Still, they were game to build the cabin with his blessing, using mostly recycled materials and milling their own wood from fallen trees they found in the forest. “Give a couple teenagers a commercial chain saw, what could happen?” Tom Sieniewicz joked. The boys picked up the new skills they needed by watching YouTube videos; the rest they’d learned as children in woodworking classes.\n\nNot everyone who builds a replica Walden cabin takes as long as the Sieniewicz family because not everyone takes as strict an environmental approach. But like them, most have made it a group effort.\n\nJim and Rachel Van Eerden had a “barn raising” for their cabin in Stokesdale, N.C., with friends building historically accurate furniture, a contractor working on the frame, and even a blacksmith forging nails in the style of the 1850s. Their “Walden” cabin is the first in a growing series of literature-inspired structures on their homestead property, rented out via Airbnb and VRBO. The listing explicitly warns would-be visitors about the lack of plumbing, electricity and Wi-Fi; showers and toilets are available at nearby “Narnia cottage,” instead.\n\nTheir cabin’s interior is nearly true to Thoreau’s model, with even the dents and nicks in the wood desk matching the writer’s own. They made a few additions to the structure though. “We gave ourselves what we called the ‘third year liberty’ where we said, ‘OK, if Thoreau would have stayed a third year, he would have wanted a little front porch. He would’ve wanted a garret,’” said Mr. Van Eerden.\n\nJeffrey Ryan had originally planned to build his cabin solo to mimic Thoreau, but he pivoted after nearly falling from an 8-foot ladder. “That’s when I said, ‘Time out, I’m calling for help,’” Mr. Ryan said. He completed the work on his cabin with the help of a childhood friend, building it in the woods behind his house in Maine. In line with Thoreau’s environmentalist ethos, he sourced used and recycled materials wherever possible — many of the wood beams were leftovers from the construction of his main house, the wood stove was a gift from a neighbor, and the antique windows were purchased on Facebook Marketplace. “I’ve stayed remarkably true to his vision,” he said. He also stayed close to Thoreau’s cost: Mr. Ryan spent $1,670 on supplies. Thoreau spent $28.12½; about $1,200 in today’s dollars.\n\nBut for others, using Thoreau’s exact methods is beside the point. Kevin Klein built his cabin in the woods behind his house in Hingham, Mass. two years ago, tapping his stepfather, a master carpenter, to help. He paid a contractor to put on the roof and spent roughly $4,500 on materials from Lowe’s. “This isn’t a strict, historical fetishization project,” he said.\n\nMr. Klein first became acquainted with Thoreau when he was in high school, watching “South Park.” In a Season 1 episode, Cartman wins a writing contest by plagiarizing “Walden” and Mr. Klein, curious and unfamiliar, bought a copy. It still lives on his bookshelf, and he’s read it multiple times.\n\nEven before “Walden,” critics questioned Thoreau’s motivations for building and moving into his isolated cabin. “I think he touches a lot of nerves,” said Laura Walls, a scholar of American Transcendentalism. “What a lazy bum this guy has to be, not pulling his weight in society and isolating himself like that,” she said, paraphrasing his detractors.\n\nBut for fans of Thoreau, that individualism is the appeal, “the whole idea of leaving society behind and rebelling against industrialization and being self-reliant with hand tools,” said Luke Barnett, whose Sam Beauford Woodworking Institute offers the Walden cabin series. Mr. Barnett was first introduced to Thoreau in fifth grade, bribed with Snickers bars as part of a reading program. “I loved it,” he said, “It’s kind of dry, let’s not lie and pretend it’s not. But the concepts in it attracted me and I reread it every few years.”\n\nAs a child, Mr. Barnett experienced periods of homelessness and came into his woodworking career after dropping out of high school. Though most of his work involves power tools, Mr. Barnett still sees the value in doing things by hand and offers his class to help empower like-minded woodworkers and outdoors people. “With just those tools, they can build anything they could ever imagine. They do not even need electricity,” he said. “Nobody can ever take that away from you. You are completely self reliant.”\n\nIn addition to championing self-reliance, Thoreau was an early environmentalist. Today’s Walden Pond is lush with trees, thanks to a state reservation program, but Thoreau witnessed immense swathes of the forest torn down by loggers. He was among the first to decry the loss, and among the first to question the rampant consumerism which drove its degradation. An Abolitionist, Thoreau avoided sugar, which was produced by slave labor, and he wore simple clothes instead of the new Paris fashions.\n\nTo be an ethical consumer of food, clothes, shelter or even entertainment today is difficult. But a few hours alone in a simple cabin can offer some perspective. Dr. Walls explained, “The whole point for Thoreau was a deliberate experiment in simplifying our wants — what we think we want — and trying to get to the heart of what it means to live a full life.”\n\nSelf reliance doesn’t mean hermitude. It didn’t for Thoreau — while living at Walden, he regularly went into Concord for supplies, visited with friends and ate meals with his family.\n\nBut, he also sometimes needed a break. While at Walden, Thoreau read and wrote, swam in the lake, and spent hours in total stillness, raptly observing nature from his doorway. “I grew in those seasons like corn in the night,” Thoreau wrote of the experience.\n\nFor Mr. Ryan, his cabin offers a peaceful space just for writing. “The simplicity invites focus,” he said. He has just a kerosene lamp, a desk modeled after Thoreau’s and bookshelves full of research material (to avoid using Google). “It naturally makes me not want to check email impulsively. I’m there to write.”\n\nMr. Klein mostly uses his cabin as a quiet place to smoke his cigars. He, his wife and their four children hike in the woods behind their home and will occasionally sleep out in the cabin, using mats and blankets from the house.\n\nThe Van Eerdens only sometimes get to read in their cabin; at about $130 a night, it’s usually booked “We have literally had guests from Germany, from New Zealand, from Paris, from London, all arriving with this excitement about stepping into a book that made a mark on them,” Mr. Van Eerden said. Sometimes the excitement exceeds experience; he’s had to explain to some guests how to start a fire in the fireplace.\n\nJasper Sieniewicz has read some Thoreau, but not as extensively as his father. “I’m sure it’s instilled in me in ways that I probably am not even really aware of,” he said. His father has furnished the cabin authentically, with hard wooden chairs and a desk; if it were up to Jasper, there’d be a couch instead, but he recognizes that his father will be enjoying more time there than he and his brother, who are busy building their careers as engineers.\n\nSatchel did spend the night there a few years back with his then girlfriend. “I honestly would be too scared to stay there alone,” he said.",

    "description": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers",
    "fullText": "UPFs are made to encourage addiction and consumption and should be regulated like tobacco, say researchers\n\nUltra-processed foods (UPFs) have \n\nUPFs and cigarettes are engineered to encourage addiction and consumption, researchers from three US universities said, pointing to the parallels in widespread health harms that link both.\n\nUPFs, which are widely available worldwide, are food products that have been industrially manufactured, often using emulsifiers or artificial colouring and flavours. The category includes soft drinks and packaged snacks such as crisps and biscuits.\n\nThere are similarities in the production processes of UPFs and cigarettes, and in manufacturers’ efforts to optimise the “doses” of products and how quickly they act on reward pathways in the body, according to the paper from researchers at Harvard, the University of Michigan and Duke University.\n\nThey draw on data from the fields of addiction science, nutrition and public health history to make their comparisons, published on 3 February in the healthcare journal the Milbank Quarterly.\n\nThe authors suggest that marketing claims on the products, such as being “low fat” or “sugar free”, are “health washing” that can stall regulation, akin to the advertising of cigarette filters in the 1950s as protective innovations that “in practice offered little meaningful benefit”.\n\nUltra-processed food involves extremely high levels of manufacturing to produce. It includes all formula milk, many commercially produced baby and toddler foods, fizzy drinks and sweets, fast food, snacks, biscuits and cakes, as well as mass-produced bread and breakfast cereals, ready meals and desserts.\n\nUltra-processed ingredients include fruit juice concentrates, maltodextrin, dextrose, golden syrup, hydrogenated oils, soya protein isolate, gluten, “mechanically separated meat”, organic dried egg whites, as well as rice and potato starch and corn fibre. Additives such as monosodium glutamate, colourings, thickeners and glazing agents are also ultra-processed.\n\nUltra-processed food contains higher levels of salt, sugar, fat and additives that are associated with obesity, cancer, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also tend to have lower levels of protein, zinc, magnesium, vitamins A, C, D, E, B12 and niacin necessary for a child’s optimal growth and development. It is also thought that other mechanisms are at play in UPFs being associated with worse health outcomes, including negative effects on the development of gut microbiota.\n\n“Many UPFs share more characteristics with cigarettes than with minimally processed fruits or vegetables and therefore warrant regulation commensurate with the significant public health risks they pose,” they concluded.\n\nOne of the authors, Prof Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan, a clinical psychologist specialising in addiction, said her patients made the same links: “They would say, ‘I feel addicted to this stuff, I crave it – I used to smoke cigarettes [and] now I have the same habit but it’s with soda and doughnuts. I know it’s killing me; I want to quit, but I can’t.’”\n\nThe debate around UPFs fits a well-worn pattern in the field of addiction, according to Gearhardt. She said: “We just blame it on the individual for a while and say ‘oh, you know, just smoke in moderation, drink in moderation’ – and eventually we get to a point where we understand the levers that the industry can pull to create products that can really hook people.”\n\nWhile food, unlike tobacco, is essential for survival, the authors argue that the distinction makes action doubly necessary because it is difficult to opt out of the modern food environment.\n\nGearhardt said it should be possible to distinguish between harmful UPFs and other foodstuffs in the same way that alcoholic drinks are differentiated from other beverages.\n\nUPFs meet “established benchmarks” as to whether a substance should be considered addictive, the paper argues, with design features that “can drive compulsive use” – although “the harms of UPFs are clear, irrespective of their addictive nature”.\n\nThe authors suggested that lessons from tobacco regulation, “including litigation, marketing restrictions and structural interventions”, could offer a guide to reducing harm related to UPFs, calling for public health efforts to “shift from individual responsibility to food industry accountability”.\n\nProf Martin Warren, chief scientific officer at the Quadram Institute, a specialist food research centre, said that while there were parallels between UPFs and tobacco, the authors risked “overreach” in their comparisons.\n\nThere were questions, he said, over whether UPFs were, like nicotine, “intrinsically addictive in a pharmacological sense, or whether they mainly exploit learned preferences, reward conditioning and convenience”.\n\nHe said it was also important to consider whether the adverse health effects attributed to UPFs came from their contents, or because they replaced “whole foods rich in fibre, micronutrients and protective phytochemicals”. He said: “This distinction matters, because it influences whether regulatory responses should mirror tobacco control or instead prioritise dietary quality, reformulation standards, and food system diversification.”\n\nDr Githinji Gitahi, chief executive of Amref Health Africa, said: “This journal article reinforces a growing public health alarm sounding across Africa [where] corporates have found a comfortable, and profitable, nexus: weak government regulation on harmful products and a changing pattern of consumption.\n\n“All this places new and preventable pressures on already stretched health systems,” he said. “Without publicly led interventions on the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, we risk health systems’ collapse.”",

Tan did not name the new hire.\n\nIntel's stock has rallied over the last year as investors gain optimism about the company's foundry business, but the company is primarily making chips for itself.\n\nOver the past few years, the embattled American chipmaker has fallen behind major semiconductor players that have seen a boost from the AI data center buildout.\n\nEarlier this month, production snags and supply troubles overshadowed the chipmaker's better-than-expected quarterly results. Investors had also been hoping for more clarity on an anchor customer for its foundry segment.\n\nLast year, the company received a wave of big investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia.\n\nTan also discussed the memory chip shortage rattling the technology sector.\n\nRising AI data center demand has created a supply and demand imbalance that's allowed memory chip companies to continue hiking prices.\n\nHe called AI the \"biggest challenge\" for memory and said he expects \"no relief until 2028.\"",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON/NEW YORK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Oil refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast are struggling to absorb a rapid surge in Venezuelan crude shipments since last month's flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington, pressuring prices and leaving some volumes unsold, according to traders and shipping data.\n\nWhat challenges are U.S. refiners facing with Venezuelan crude?\n\nHow might India's trade deal affect Venezuelan oil sales?\n\nWhat role do trading houses play in Venezuelan exports?\n\nHow has Venezuelan oil export volume changed recently?\n\nThe soft U.S. demand represents ​an early obstacle for President Donald Trump's hopes of sending the majority of the South American country's oil to the United States since U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro ‌last month in a raid in Caracas.\n\nTrading houses Vitol and Trafigura were granted U.S. licenses to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil following the U.S. operation and a subsequent supply agreement with interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\nThe trading houses, ‌which joined energy major Chevron in holding approval to export Venezuelan oil, struck several early deals to sell some cargoes to refiners in the U.S. and Europe. However, with Chevron also raising exports quickly, the trading companies are now finding it harder to secure enough buyers among Gulf Coast refiners, traders said.\n\n\"We're all facing this issue where there's more to place and not enough takers,\" one of the traders said, citing reluctance from U.S. refiners to buy Venezuelan crude. Some refiners are complaining that prices, albeit declining, remain high compared to competing Canadian heavy grades.\n\nVenezuelan heavy oil cargoes for delivery at the Gulf Coast are being offered at ⁠about $9.50 per barrel below benchmark Brent, versus discounts of between $6 and $7.50 per ‌barrel in mid-January.\n\nLast month, total Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. almost tripled to 284,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data based on tanker movements.\n\nThe U.S. was absorbing some 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil before Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. But exports to the U.S. went to zero in mid-2025 ‍after Trump revoked all licenses to trade and ship.\n\nReaching the U.S. refiners' maximum capacity again will require time, one of the traders said, in part because some facilities would require adjustments to process heavier oil.\n\nThe chief executive of refiner Phillips 66, Mark Lashier, said on Tuesday the company can process around 250,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, but prices must be competitive for Venezuelan grades to displace other sources of heavy oil.\n\nChevron and Trafigura declined to comment. ​Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA and Vitol did not reply to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Researchers are sounding the alarm after finding antibiotic resistance genes released from melting Antarctic glaciers.\n\nA study published in the journal Biocontaminant examined the effects of glacial melting on our water supply.\n\nGlaciers serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes, or ARGs, and other microbes. When they are released from the ice, they enter our water systems, posing a major health risk to people downstream.\n\nMillions of people get their water from glacier-fed rivers and lakes. ARGs are strands of DNA that make bacteria more resistant to drugs. When ARGs in meltwater make their way into our water supply, they become a global public health risk.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of viewing glaciers, rivers, and lakes as being part of a \"glacier continuum.\" This means they are an interconnected system rather than separate environments.\n\nFrom our gas-powered cars to overconsumption, human activity has contributed to the production of heat-trapping gases that warm the planet. Rising global temperatures have caused glaciers to rapidly melt, causing elevated sea levels and releasing ARGs.\n\nARGs from melting glaciers are worrisome because they help facilitate the spread of diseases. This threat is compounded by the fact that our growing microplastic problem is also helping antibiotic-resistant bacteria breed. As a result, medicines are being rendered less effective.\n\nOne way we can combat warming temperatures is by making more eco-friendly lifestyle choices. This might include installing solar panels, which can help you slash utility rates and cut energy-related pollution.\n\nTCD's Solar Explorer curates competitive bids from vetted installers, saving you up to $10,000 on installation. EnergySage, a TCD partner, provides a free service that helps people find installers, save thousands, and understand available incentives.\n\nOngoing research into the effects of glacial melt helps us understand and approach the problem of ARGs.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Climate change is reshaping microbial risks in ways we are only beginning to understand,\" study co-author Guannan Mao of Lanzhou University told The Microbiologist.\n\n\"Recognizing glaciers as part of the global antibiotic resistance landscape is an important step toward protecting both environmental and human health.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

And I blame the United States people for this too. They’re getting what they deserve because the last election was simple. You had the choice of the Constitution or the criminal.

Wouldn’t serve his country, and yet he stands out there and preaches patriotism,” Jesse Ventura said.\n\nSpeaking on the SpinSisters Podcast last week, Ventura floated the idea of Minnesota seceding from the United States and joining Canada after Trump suggested that the Great White North should become a U.S. state.\n\n“I am one that thinks, let me throw this out on your show and we’ll get some headlines. How about since Trump dislikes Minnesota so bad, and we’re so out of control, let’s join Canada?” Jesse Ventura asked.\n\n“Instead of Canada becoming the 51st state of America and lose their healthcare, like they said, they would never do that because they’d lose their healthcare.

    "fullText": "Journalists in Gaza have bartered their lives to tell a truth that much of the world still doesn’t want to hear.\n\nThis piece is part of A Day for Gaza, an initiative in which The Nation has turned over its website exclusively to voices from the Gaza Strip. You can find all of the work in the series here.\n\nCan you fathom what it means to be a journalist in Gaza? To go months without holding your children simply because their proximity to you may get them killed?\n\nBefore the war began, I worked as an English-language correspondent in Gaza. I sought out mostly stories of success: The ambition that glittered in the eyes of our children, the enduring cultural traditions of the Strip and its landmarks. We were a people worn down by the scarcity of choice. But we were intent on survival, willed toward a better future, souls nourished by hope and by love.\n\nThen, overnight, in October 2023, I was pushed to become a war correspondent. Some of my first reports came from the inside of the emergency room at Al-Shifa Hospital, where I encountered an endless procession of victims. I shuddered through the sound of bombardment and fire belts, shook at the sight of a charred child, a wounded woman, a mutilated boy.\n\nNot long after, the military declared that the north of Gaza had been made into a military zone—and I was forced to make a decision. A car was prepared to take me south where I could continue to report more formally, protected by the purported safety of my press vest and my profession. This would mean leaving behind my home and family indefinitely, their fate wholly unpredictable. But there was another option. I could stay, stand before a camera without any protection, and explain to the world what was happening to us. I told them I wouldn’t leave.\n\nLet me tell you something I’ve never admitted: I knew, in that moment, that the world would betray us. I knew that everything that had come and everything that was yet to come would not be enough to move the people of the world. My heart writhes in pain over what I endured in the north. And yet here I am, after all these long months, still pleading with the world, still proclaiming my belief in your humanity.\n\nSince the beginning of the genocide, Israel has consistently targeted journalists. It has destroyed our images, strangled our voices, and uprooted our words. These transgressions against Palestinian journalists have only one purpose: to allow Israel to carry out its plans in the darkness, granting its military free rein to commit whatever bloody atrocity it desires.\n\nEach of the 245 journalists killed by Israel had a life, a family, a dream, ambitions. Some were waiting for the birth of their child, others were killed having barely known their newborn. My friend, Yahya Sobeih, was murdered hours after he spent an afternoon handing out sweets in celebration of his daughter’s birth. Mohammed Salameh had plans to marry his fiancée, Hala, only days after he was murdered. Death swallows us whole here. One after the other, our colleagues and friends fall like leaves in autumn.\n\nRecall the morning of August 25, 2025: The Israeli army bombed the Nasser Medical Complex. Two strikes in sequence: a “double-tap.” The first claimed the lives of the journalists, civilians, and doctors who had sheltered in the hospital. The second strike anticipated the arrival of rescue teams and other journalists who had hurried towards the site. It was a coordinated crime that unfolded live before the eyes of the world. Twenty civilians were murdered and countless more were wounded—among them, five of my colleagues, including my friend Mohammed Salameh.\n\nHow can this world live with the reality that there exists an entire people whose hospitals are continuously bombed—hospitals that are overflowing with doctors, patients, with those who have been forced to seek refuge inside its walls? Hospitals that hold journalists who have been forced there to document, moment by moment, the realities of brutal, dirty, greedy war? Have our souls really become so cheap?\n\nShortly after the TV channel, Al-Ghad, liv-streamed the second strike on the Nasser Medical Complex, its Gaza correspondent, Ibrahim Qanan, went to Instagram to explain the predictability of these sort of attacks. “Israel possesses highly precise weaponry,” he wrote. “They knew, without a doubt, that members of the Civil Defense were present in the building when it was struck. But, as they see it, there is nobody standing in their way. Israel commits war crimes on a live broadcast simply because they understand that there is nobody in the international community who is willing to confront them.”\n\nJournalism is supposed to be the fourth estate. The safety of its practitioners is considered sacred, even during times of war or conflict. But in Gaza, journalists have been offered no protection. Instead, they’ve been left to die as they broadcast their daily pleas.\n\nRayan El Amine, Jack Mirkinson, and Lizzy Ratner\n\nOur practice has not fundamentally changed since the ceasefire. We journalists continue to report under immense pressure, enduring the psychological strain brought on by repeated military attacks. Our psyches are now more familiar with war than with peace.\n\nHere’s how Abdullah Miqdad, Gaza’s correspondent for Al Araby TV, has described our present condition:\n\n“The constant psychological fear for a journalist is that escalation and war could return at any moment. Journalistic life cannot go back to what it was before the war. The nature of coverage has changed. It now encompasses all the catastrophic consequences the war has left behind, expanding how daily life itself is reported and examined.”\n\nAmid this precarity, we continue to offer our bodies as proof that the danger we face is real. So many of us have lost family members. Some of us carry those shrouds with us everyday. Others have already penned our wills, anticipating our death at any moment. At night, we forgo sleep for the company of murder and destruction; we will ourselves towards danger. Atop the rubble, we share images of charred bodies, wading through flesh and the smell of blood.\n\nThis is not heroic: We persist because there is no alternative. We have surrendered even the safety of our own families in order to protect the truth.\n\n“Two years of war have left a permanent mark,” the journalist Ibrahim al-Khalili told me, “We have covered events no human can bear.”\n\nHow can a person return to normalcy after witnessing every intimate detail of this genocide? What might heal such a soul?\n\nPerhaps the greatest lesson we have learned bartering with our lives is that the world is truly unconvinced by our words, unmoved by our images.\n\nEven after all this time, many international news agencies continue to treat our work as if it were unreliable, as if we are witnesses unworthy of believing. The truth of our own murder, our own annihilation, can only be verified if told through a voice that parachutes into our desecrated Strip. Our words, drenched in blood, are insufficient; only foreign journalists can truly tell our story.\n\nIn the thrum of this hypocrisy, seeking to minimize their fiscal liability, most international news agencies have turned to another kind of exploitation. They have replaced official employees with contractors, paid monthly or per report or image, and foregone the legal responsibility that guarantees our protection. Our bodies are sacrificed to protect institutions that don’t even believe us. If these news agencies continue to find prominence without honoring our labor and blood, then surely we are entitled to decide who narrates our story—who carries our cause, who bears our words to the world.\n\nWhen one of our colleagues is martyred, a cloud of grief descends on us all, and our strength falters. We have come to know this profession as a subjugation.\n\nThere is a collective understanding among journalists in Gaza that those who have perished will not be the last, that any one of us could be next. Everyday as I report, I think of my family, of my fate. I wonder if my name will be soon added to the list of martyrs simply because I insist on writing, on recording, on sharing the realities we live through. What is being done to us is a stain on a world complicit in our annihilation. But nothing can be taken from us anymore.\n\nAya Jouda, a field correspondent for Tasnim News, has spent years documenting the siege on Gaza. Her persistence, she said, comes from a belief that “to witness these events is a human, ethical, and national duty.”\n\n“Gaza is not a headline, or a statistical report. It is human lives being annihilated beneath bombardment and blockade,” she said. “Yes, when the outside world shows solidarity, it gives me hope. It’s proof that our voices can reach beyond these borders. But when that solidarity is absent, our sense of betrayal deepens and with it, our determination to keep telling the truth, no matter the dangers we face.”\n\nLike my colleagues, I can no longer be stopped. There are days when it feels as though our lives are going to waste; our efforts are pointless, our will to persist misspent. We are sustained, however, by the fragile faith that perhaps, overnight, the world may halt this ruthless war. We await that day with the hope that our lives may one day be lived as they ought to be: in love and in peace.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Feb 3 (Reuters) - Gold and silver prices rebounded sharply on Tuesday after a steep selloff over the previous two sessions, with the bullion on ​track for its biggest daily rise since November 2008 as bargain‑hunters stepped in ‌amid resilient underlying fundamentals.\n\nSpot gold rose 5.2% to $4,906.82 per ounce by 01:31 p.m. ET (1831 GMT), recovering from Monday's low ‌of $4,403.24 but still trading below last week's record high of $5,594.82.\n\nU.S. gold futures for April delivery settled 6.1% higher at $4,935 per ounce.\n\nSilver surged 4.8% to $83.23 an ounce on Tuesday, after a record 27% one‑day decline on Friday and falling a further 6% on Monday.\n\n\"I view the recent losses ⁠as corrective within the long‑term ‌uptrend,\" said Peter Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals. He added many of the fundamentals that have driven gold higher ‍over recent years remain firmly in place.\n\n\"At this point, we are likely to see a period of consolidation, with $4,400 an important support level on the downside and resistance probably around $5,100 on the upside,\" Grant ​said.\n\nPrecious metals retreated sharply over the past two sessions as Kevin Warsh was named ‌the next head of the Federal Reserve, after Chair Jerome Powell steps down in May. Investors expect Warsh to support rate cuts but tighten the Fed's balance sheet. Additionally, the CME Group raised margin requirements on precious metal futures, which further weighed on prices.\n\nDespite the recent volatility, analysts broadly expect the bull market to continue, with the yellow metal likely to ⁠hit fresh peaks later this year.\n\n\"We expect prices to ​resume their longer term rise at a more sustainable ​pace as investors continue to be extremely concerned about economic and political conditions,\" said CPM Group managing partner Jeffrey Christian.\n\nGold is widely regarded as a ‍safe haven and typically ⁠performs well in low interest rate environments.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Monday the closely watched employment report for January would not be released this ⁠Friday due to a partial shutdown of the federal government.\n\nAmong other metals, spot platinum climbed 3.4% to $2,194.05 per ‌ounce, while palladium was up 0.4% at $1,727.03.",

    "description": "There are four things supporting the US stock market's elevated valuation. If any of the key trends reverse, it could threaten gains, Piper Sandler says.",
    "fullText": "As the S&P 500 trades near record highs, Piper Sandler analysts highlight four key supports to valuations, noting that \"a sustained reversal in any of these trends would be a potential risk for the market.\"\n\nDespite some worries on Wall Street that the US stock market is overvalued, the analysts don't expect valuations to move much in either direction in 2026. \"Our view is that multiples stay higher for longer,\" they write.\n\nHowever, Piper Sandler said four factors are propping up elevated valuations, and if any of them break, it could trigger a valuation collapse.\n\nThe analysts note that valuation shouldn't be used as a tool to time the market, but rather a \"condition of the risk perceived by investors.\" Charles Schwab recently underlined this point, noting that while \"valuation is a horrible market-timing tool,\" investors can think of high valuations as a way of knowing if the market is vulnerable to shocks.\n\nHere are the four things that Piper Sandler sees reinforcing high valuations:\n\nCurrent high equity valuations reflect high operating margins, Piper Sandler said. Operating margin growth, which measures the share of sales left after operating expenses, signal improved efficiencies.\n\nHigh margins are largely driven by tech. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk highlighted that in the past 20 years, \"all of the increase in the S&P 500's operating margin has come from tech‑related sectors.\"\n\nAI enthusiasm has not only boosted markets, but is also expected to boost productivity and operating efficiency, supporting high margins. \"Technology is steroids for margins,\" T.Rowe Price global multi-asset head and CIO Sébastien Page said, nodding to the US stock market's historic outperformance compared to global markets.\n\nTight credit spreads mean corporate borrowing costs are low. It refers the \"spread\" between the rates lenders charge companies and a benchmark like Treasury yields.\n\nJanus Henderson Investors' portfolio managers Brent Olson and Tom Ross said that credit spreads could hold tight, highlighting the period of the mid-2000s and late-2010s when spreads hovered near historically low levels. They flagged a strong global economy, additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, corporate bond scarcity relative to government offerings, and updated corporate ratings as reasons spreads should stay tight.\n\nThe \"biggest threat\" to the credit gap, in Janus Henderson Investors' view, is \"some shocking economic data\" signaling a recession or a spike in inflation, which could translate to a Fed rate hike.\n\nOil prices declined in 2025 and, despite seeing an uptick in year-to-date, are still constrained amid forecasts for more supply and uncertain demand.\n\nPiper Sandler compared oil prices to S&P 500 price-to-earnings, to show that relatively low prices support the index's valuation.\n\n\"Lower energy prices have played a key role in recent years in lifting equity multiples,\" the analysts said. They also highlight that low energy costs contribute to real rates feel lower than Treasury yields suggest.\n\nPiper Sandler credits \"waning\" inflation as a support to US equity markets, comparing core personal consumption expenditure data, a measure of inflation favored by the Fed, to market performance.\n\n\"In the post-Covid world, investors have a heightened sensitivity and fear of inflation,\" meaning lower inflation offers a \"boost\" to multiples.\n\nLPL Financial research shows that \"the highest stock valuations have been observed when inflation, represented by the CPI, is lowest, and vice versa.\"",

    "fullText": "Disney's new CEO is sending a wink with his wardrobe, whether he means to or not.\n\nJosh D'Amaro, who takes the helm of the Mouse House next month, has drawn attention for dressing much like his soon-to-be predecessor, Bob Iger. Both men regularly don sweaters over collared shirts and have a penchant for jackets paired with white dress shirts. At a celebration for Disney's 70th Anniversary last year, the pair sported button-downs and dark slacks.\n\nWhile D'Amaro may just have a natural affinity for the same kind of attire that Iger sports, leadership experts say the similar look projects continuity to Disney's stakeholders. The familiarity may resonate at Disney, where Iger has led the company on and off for nearly two decades — though it raises a question of whether the rest of us should dress like the leaders we hope to one day succeed.\n\n\"You want to avoid looking like a carbon copy of the person,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International in Chicago. \"But there are elements that you want to keep if you can.\"\n\nThose elements should be modest, akin to how Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn't deviate too far from the black turtleneck and jeans his predecessor Steve Jobs regularly wore, suggested Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\nA few years ago, she said a client of hers from a Fortune 200 retailer went overboard by wearing the same distinctive jewelry as his boss. When she met with his peers for feedback on his performance, several described him as a copycat.\n\n\"It really hurt him,\" said Eggers. \"We coached him, and he eventually lost his jewelry.\"\n\nStill, there can be benefits to mimicking a higher-up's sense of fashion when done subtly, added Akubuiro. \"People have a tendency to like people who are more like them,\" he said.\n\nJust keep in mind the fuzzy warm feeling may be temporary.\n\n\"It's effective as a bridge maybe, but not as a destination,\" said Eggers. \"Eventually, leadership credibility has to stand on its own.\"\n\nD'Amaro, who started at Disney in 1998 as a Disneyland business planner, faces a challenging road ahead no matter what he wears. He's tasked with growing streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu to offset declines in its TV networks business, while easing ESPN's transition into the streaming age.\n\nA post shared by Robert Iger (@robertiger)\n\nWhile D'Amaro's fashion style is similar to Iger's, Akubuiro said the business-casual look has also made sense for his role as a park executive.\n\n\"This is kind of the uniform of someone walking around the parks, and so it gives him a very accessible feel,\" Akubuiro said. \"When you're making a change, that accessibility is something that actually brings people in and gives them some confidence.\"",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA New Zealand cave has revealed million-year-old fossils, including 12 ancient bird species and four frog species.\n\nExperts believe the discovery shows how drastically New Zealand’s forest culture has shifted.\n\nResearchers said up to 50 percent of species on Aotearoa’s North Island went extinct before humans arrived.\n\nA spectacular trove of fossils in a discovered in a cave on New Zealand's North Island has given scientists their first glimpse of ancient forest species that lived there more than a million years ago. The fossils represent 12 ancient bird species and four frog species, including several previously unknown bird species. Taken together, the fossils paint a picture of an ancient world that looks drastically different than it does today. The discovery also fills in an important gap in scientific understanding of the patterns of extinction that preceded human arrival in New Zealand 750 years ago.\n\nThe team published a study on the find in Alcheringa: An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.\n\n“This is a newly recognized avifauna for New Zealand, one that was replaced by the one humans encountered a million years later,” Trevor Worthy, lead study author and associate professor at Flinders University, said in a statement. “This remarkable find suggests our ancient forests were once home to a diverse group of birds that did not survive the next million years.”\n\nThe team located the fossils between two layers of volcanic ash preserved in the cave, each from a different major eruption, the first 1.55 million years ago and the second 1 million years ago. Many of the species represented among the fossils had already gone extinct by the time humans arrived on the island. By extrapolation, the research team estimated that between 33 and 50 percent of all species on the island went extinct during the million years before humans arrived in New Zealand, likely thanks to rapid climate shifts and cataclysmic volcanic eruptions, said Paul Scofield, study co-author and Canterbury Museum senior curator of natural history.\n\nWorthy said that “for decades, the extinction of New Zealand’s birds was viewed primarily through the lens of human arrival 750 years ago. This study proves that natural forces like super-volcanoes and dramatic climate shifts were already sculpting the unique identity of our wildlife over a million years ago.”\n\nOf all the finds, scientists might be the giddiest about discovering a new species of parrot, Strigops insulaborealis, an ancient relative of the iconic Kākāpō, a large flightless parrot known for its heft. The team believes this ancestor may have possessed the ability to fly. By analyzing the fossil discovery, the team noticed the ancient bird had weaker legs than the modern relative, implying the ancestor wasn’t quite the skilled climber as the modern-day Kākāpō. Still, the team said more research is needed to confirm that this ancient bird could fly.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered an ancestor of the modern Takahe, which opens further research into that bird. Fossils of an extinct species of pigeon closely related to the Australian bronzewing pigeons also excited experts.\n\n“The shifting forest and shrubland habitats forced a reset of the bird populations,” Scofield said. “We believe this was a major driver for the evolutionary diversification of birds and other fauna in the North Island.”\n\nScofield said that previous excavations showed life in New Zealand between 20 and 16 million years ago and that by contrast, the new discoveries offer the first evidence of life from 15 million years ago to one million years ago. “This wasn’t a missing chapter in New Zealand’s ancient history,” Scofield said, “it was a missing volume.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Personalized skincare regimes and tailor-made cocktails are all the rage. However, having a signature scent is the cherry on top of a well-coordinated beauty routine. Selecting the right scent is an important task. That's why we interviewed multiple experts who know perfume exceptionally well to lead you in the right direction.\n\nKalliope Amorphous, Perfume Artist at Black Baccara Artisan Perfumes, who has been a perfumer for fifteen years, says some of the major issues people face when choosing the right perfume are a lack of knowledge about perfume notes, not understanding how they work together and change while they are worn, or trying too many perfumes at once and experiencing sensory fatigue, or starting with heavier perfumes before lighter ones.\n\nPerfume notes are the ingredients that make up a fragrance, and they work similarly to notes in music. When multiple notes are combined, they form accords, which give perfumes their unique structure and presence, says Amorphous. \"Base notes are the notes that anchor the fragrance and are the most long-lasting, while top notes are what you will often smell first but they tend to disappear the fastest, and middle notes usually tie the base and top notes together.\"\n\nWith so many perfumes on the market, we made it easier to find the right scent by narrowing down some of the most popular options. You'll also find expert tips and answers to common fragrance questions.\n\nFragrance is personal, so it's all about what your nose fancies, says Stacey Bresnahan, Founder of Laubahn Perfumes. If your nose follows slightly sweet and musky scents, this product is for you as the black opium awakens the senses. The coffee accord and orange blossom are mild, but intense at the same time, and perfect for evenings.\n\nWhen selecting a perfume, you'll likely find the categorizations of floral, gourmand, or woody helpful, says Vincent, \"They can help as a generalized starting point for perfumes you enjoy. I actually tend to find I like Balsamic, Gourmand perfumes, when actually what I tend to purchase and formulate are Floral fragrances.\" Maison Margiela's line of fragrances, under the name REPLICA, is designed to transport you to sense memory and this floral yet sensual fragrance takes you to a sun-filled vacation with notes of bergamot, ylang-ylang, white musks, and coconut milk.\n\nOne of the most practical ways to customize a fragrance is to consider the time and place you'll choose to wear a particular scent, says Dressel. Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanille is a warm and spicy scent that is perfect for date night or going out dancing with friends. This reinvention of a tobacco fragrance combines tonka bean, vanilla, and dry fruit accords with sweet wood sap for an elegant, nighttime perfume.\n\nIf you're looking for a fragrance for the office, you can tailor your daytime fragrance towards a lighter variety, points out Dressel. Glossier You is an open ended perfume that grows on you with its slightly sweet heart of a scent that comes from ambrette seeds.\n\nFounded by stylist and digital influencer Chriselle Lim in 2021, PHLUR is a new brand on the scene that has launched multiple viral fragrances. None more intriguing than the cult-favorite Missing Person, a floral musk with notes of sheer jasmine, neroli blossom, and Australian sandalwood that blend into a delicate, almost skin-like scent.\n\nHenry Rose crafts a fragrance after you answer a short quiz about your preferences. It asks your reason to wear a fragrance, whether you want to feel sensual or to make an impression. According to your flavor palette and understanding of what you want the perfume to evoke, it suggests the right fragrance from the entire collection.\n\nIf you're shopping for a special occasion fragrance, you might want to consider perfumes with richer notes that sustain throughout the evening, says Dressel. Byredo's Gypsy Water has a woody aroma. This unisex perfume has an addictive sandalwood, vanilla, and amber blend.\n\nBresnahan's suggestion for choosing the right fragrance is to start by sampling fragrances with a familiar scent and seeing how it smells on you. If you love the scent of flowers, this one is perfect for all occasions as it smells like a floral bouquet of jasmine, freesia, and rose petals enriched by an addictive scent of patchouli and vanilla.\n\nThis seductive perfume has a sparkling, bold floral-woody fragrance. Middle notes usually last way longer than top notes and add more depth to the scent experience, says Bresnahan. With accords of jasmine and May rose, it's a classic fragrance for every age group.\n\nMake a change and select perfumes that make you feel a certain way, says Emma Vincent, perfumer at Lush. \"Could it smell comforting, or uplifting or make you feel confident - is that what you need right now?\" If it's beauty and that joy you want to feel, this optimistic fragrance that smells of thousands of flowers is the right pick.\n\nWhen you want to change things up, Vincent suggests experimenting with layering perfumes. \"Maybe one day I want to wear a confident perfume such as the one I created for Lush called Nero, and I will layer this with my wedding fragrance I made at Lush called Confetti. The perfumes aren't too clashing, and I can have both confidence and comfort at the same time.\" Lush Karma perfume features patchouli, Brazilian orange, and Siberian fir and is a spicy yet relaxing mix.\n\nDressel points out that studies have shown that stimulating our sense of smell has an immediate impact on our mood, which is something to keep in mind as you are searching for your ideal fragrance. Clarins' Eau Dynamisante Treatment Fragrance is the brand's first fragrance and body treatment in one spa-fresh formula that sets out to calm one's nerves.\n\nScents can smell different on two different people for many reasons, says Amorphous, but the main one is body chemistry. Rihanna created this fragrance specifically for her own body and decided to share it with the world. A unique blend of magnolia and musk with tangerine, the Fenty Eau de Parfum expresses itself uniquely on each wearer for a one-of-a-kind scent.\n\nAmorphous points out that some people amplify certain notes more than others; often hormones play a part. \"Even how dry one person's skin is compared to another can make a difference in how they experience the perfume.\" Ralph Lauren Romance is a very good choice for people with dry skin as the chamomile oil and Sungoddess rose blend into the skin to last longer.\n\nVincent encourages being bold and daring when purchasing and wearing perfumes. \"Wear them for yourself first and foremost,\" she says. Marc Jacobs' playful fragrance is a comforting floral scent of rhubarb and bright daffodil. However, if you are looking for something a little less pricey, we've tested Dossier perfume, a brand that makes shockingly spot on yet affordable option of brand name fragrances.\n\nEvenings are a great time to go bold and don a perfume that is stronger and more sensual, if that is the feeling that you would like to evoke, explains Dressel. Created by the famous Spanish perfumer Alberto Morillas, Gucci Bloom is a complex tropical floral fragrance that is meant to be overpowering.\n\nSoft and seductive, Armani's My Way is a bright floral bouquet of tuberose and jasmine from India. It opens with a citrus embrace of orange blossom and bergamot meant to remind you of a summer day in a field of strawberries.\n\nZee Field, designer and founder of LOULOU DAMOUR fashions and Parfums, shared with Insider answers to common fragrance questions.\n\nThe easiest way is to research the olfactive pyramid of one to two fragrances you like and dislike. If you don't like the scent of your co-worker's perfume, this valuable information will help you to exclude those specific notes. Then create your olfactive profile.\n\nChoose an Eau de parfum or a perfume with a higher concentration of oils. A high fragrance concentration means there is less alcohol and more essential oils. Check the concentration of perfume oil on the fragrance bottle or packaging such as parfum – 20-40% or Eau de parfum – 15-20%. Make sure your fragrance is not expired.\n\nA perfume lasts up to five years. It expires much faster if not stored in a cool place as it is very sensitive to sunlight or air if left open without the cap on.\n\nThe best time to apply perfume is right after the shower before getting dressed on the chest area, shoulders, and one wrist. This application should be done at about 10 inches away. The spray of the wrist is a good tip. Once dressed, keep the five spray routines; three on the skin, two on your clothes. One behind each ear, one on the back of the neck, one on your front left shoulder, and one on your back right shoulder. Only Eau fraiche or Eau de cologne should be applied to the pulse points of the body.\n\nIt is best to test a fragrance on your skin. The only issue is that you can only test one scent at a time. I like to start with a blotter strip or card. Spray twice downwards, pass the blotter strip through the fragrance cloud, wave under your nose, and inhale. Then, I move on to the skin test. Wash your hands earlier, not just before testing fragrances, and do not apply any hand cream. Spray onto the back of your hand from a distance of four to six inches, and no more than 10 inches depending on the atomizer pump. Start with just two sprays, and leave until the oil dries.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "Disney's decision to tap Josh D'Amaro signals that the company wanted to go with a familiar, friendly face to push ahead into the AI era.",
    "fullText": "After a decade of ups and downs, Disney is picking a familiar, friendly face at the heart of its profit engine to lead the company into a new era.\n\nDisney's board just tapped Parks boss Josh D'Amaro to take over for longtime CEO Bob Iger, starting on March 18. Iger, who plans to retire as CEO for the second time, will remain in an advisor role before stepping aside for good later this year.\n\nAfter a decade marked by strategic changes and a failed succession, Disney is turning to the guy who runs its most reliable moneymaker to navigate a period of massive change in the entertainment industry.\n\nDisney's new CEO has his work cut out for him. The Mouse House's stock has only mustered an 11% gain in the last decade, compared to a more than threefold increase for the S&P 500. And while Disney's parks are gushing cash, the streaming business isn't yet making enough money to offset the steady erosion of the company's ever-fading cable networks.\n\nHowever, D'Amaro appears as well-positioned as any possible Iger successor to lead Disney into the next decade.\n\nNot only is D'Amaro intimately familiar with the company's most lucrative business, but he also seems to have the charm and leadership acumen needed to lead a juggernaut like Disney. That's in contrast to former CEO Bob Chapek, who took over after Iger's first retirement and was known as a gruff, business-minded executive who lacked Iger's high level of charisma.\n\nYet D'Amaro isn't just a likable face. Here are three points about Disney's choice of D'Amaro and what his leadership could mean for the company.\n\nWhile it's still too early to say how D'Amaro might run things, the board's decision to go with a company insider, who happened to be the consensus pick, signals a preference for stability, analysts and leadership experts told Business Insider.\n\nD'Amaro — who turns 55 on February 10 — has been at Disney since 1998. As Disney's experience chairman, D'Amaro oversees the parks division, which has been a financial standout compared to the fast-eroding linear TV business.\n\n\"The company appears to be reorganizing in ways that shore up his shortcomings,\" Pozner told Business Insider, referring to D'Amaro.\n\nDisney didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on its reasoning.\n\nBecause D'Amaro is 20 years younger than Iger, D'Amaro could have a lengthy run in the top job, she said.\n\n\"He's still got a long time horizon in front of him,\" Pozner said. \"This is really planning for the future. And I think that's a great signal about stability.\"\n\nAnalyst Joe Bonner of Argus Research said it's \"hard to really tell much about anyone under that big shadow\" of Iger.\n\nD'Amaro is known among colleagues for being a likable guy who takes selfies with parkgoers.\n\n\"D'Amaro definitely feels like a man of the people,\" Pozner said.\n\nD'Amaro is \"broadly popular\" and known for being approachable, said a Disney ad sales staffer who said they'd been in the same room as D'Amaro but hadn't met him. This person added that the incoming CEO seems \"very well-liked over at Parks\" and added that it's \"always a good sign when people love working for someone.\"\n\nThat affability could help him forge relationships in other divisions of the entertainment conglomerate — and navigate a new course while Iger initially remains on the board.\n\nPozner said D'Amaro's relative youth and his \"flesh-pressing image\" could signal that Disney's board wants to help the company maintain its friendly perception. That matters because of criticisms, for example, that the costs of the theme parks have become out of reach for some families.\n\nThat concern has worried some investors, who wonder how much consumers will be willing to hand over to spend time at the happiest place on earth, Ben Barringer, global head of technology research at the UK wealth management firm Quilter Cheviot, told Business Insider.\n\nBarringer said that D'Amaro will likely have to develop new skills to match his broader remit.\n\n\"Dealing with Parks people is different from dealing with studio people,\" Barringer said.\n\nIt could help that Walden is staying at the Mouse House in a major role.\n\nD'Amaro will likely also want to work on his influence skills, Barringer said, in part because moving the company through the big upheaval in the entertainment industry won't be easy.\n\n\"Hollywood faces quite a lot of disruption,\" he said. The ascent of AI and Disney's partnership with OpenAI are signs that more change is coming, Barringer said.\n\n\"Embracing the disruptive threat and trying to leverage it is a good way to start,\" Barringer said, referring to AI.",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - India's financial markets rallied sharply on Tuesday after a trade deal that slashed U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% ​from 50%, a development that investors said lifts a key overhang over the ‌country's stocks, bonds and currency.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50, surged nearly 5%, about 100 points away from ‌its record high hit in January. The rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading. The yield on the country's 10-year benchmark bond declined 5 bps to 6.72%\n\nThe Nifty's rise put it on course for the best one-day gain in five years while the rupee ⁠was on track for its ‌best day since November 2022.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting ‍that India had agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and lower trade barriers on U.S. exports.\n\nIndian stock markets and the rupee have been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington in late August, ​placing them among the worst-performing emerging market assets in 2025, with record foreign investor ‌outflows.\n\nThe trade breakthrough is expected to alleviate the persistent drag, with investors expecting a bounce-back in foreign sentiment and flows into Indian assets.\n\n\"We believe this trade deal announcement should lift a key overhang on Indian equities. Foreign investors who have been net sellers recently might also look to increase their weight to India in light of this announcement,\" said Prashant Paroda, portfolio ⁠manager with AllSpring Global's Intrinsic Emerging Market equities ​team.\n\nThe trade deal is also expected to lift a ​pall of geopolitical uncertainty which had accompanied the U.S.-India trade rift, keeping investors cautious on plowing money into the country.\n\n\"The key tail risk of geopolitical ‍isolation about which investors ⁠were concerned has now been adequately addressed by back-to-back trade deals with the European Union and United States,\" economists at Citi said in a note.\n\nThe breakthrough with the ⁠U.S. comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that ‌is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by ‌value.",

    "description": "The Citadel CEO said that social media has heightened business leaders' fear about publicly addressing political issues.",
    "fullText": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said that CEOs are scared of talking about politics — and sick of yo-yoing between politicians to stay successful.\n\nGriffin said that the US government's new style of direct engagement with corporate America is causing some business leaders to question whether their fortunes will change from one administration to the next, depending on their level of public support.\n\n\"When the US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favoritism, I know for most CEOs that I'm friends with, they find it incredibly distasteful,\" Griffin said at the Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event on Tuesday.\n\nLeaders, he said, would rather focus on creating value for customers and shareholders than catering to an administration.\n\n\"Most CEOs just don't want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,\" he said.\n\nGriffin criticized current and past administrations for their involvement in corporate America, citing green energy investments under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\n\"We don't need the US government to pretend to be venture capitalists,\" he said.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration took a nearly 10% stake in Intel, a few weeks after the president had called on Intel's CEO to resign, but changed his tune after a White House meeting.\n\nWhen asked why fewer CEOs are speaking out about hot-button political issues, Griffin said they're still reeling from prior years, when companies that involved themselves in what he called the \"woke movement\" were either \"embraced or ostracized\" as a result.\n\n\"That's created a level of fear and apprehension among the corporate CEO class to insert themselves in any publicly facing issues these days,\" Griffin said.\n\nSocial media has, he added, taken apprehension to a fever pitch, since sentiment about a company or its product can catch like wildfire.\n\n\"The power of social media to persuade millions or tens of millions of consumers to make a product choice is really terrifying to corporate executives,\" Griffin said. Recent deadly shootings by ICE and Border Patrol agents in Minnesota have pushed some CEOs, from big names in tech to small business owners, to comment publicly on politics again.\n\nGriffin, one of the GOP's biggest donors, was also asked about whether he has plans to run for public office, Griffin said that he hasn't ruled it out. \n\n\"I'd like to believe at a future point in my life I will be involved in public service,\" adding that it was unlikely in the next few years.\n\nIn terms of others' public service, Griffin praised Trump's pick for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, calling the nomination a \"powerful assertion that the Fed will maintain needed independence in policy decision-making.\"",

    "fullText": "The stock market was hit with a wave of selling on Tuesday as traders dumped some of the market's highest-flying tech names and reacted to a spike in oil prices.\n\nLegal-software stocks were a particularly weak point, with many falling by double digits, after Anthropic unveiled new tools that can track compliance and review legal docs.\n\nOn the tech side, investors have been wary of high valuations for months, and are anxiously watching for signs that the AI trade is under pressure. A rotation into other parts of the market that began at the start of the year accelerated in Tuesday's session.\n\nWhile many of the top tech and AI names in the S&P 500, stocks in other sectors jumped as investors looked for better deals. FedEx stock was up more than 5%, and retailers including Walmart, Target, and Costco rose as much as 2%.\n\nMeanwhile, oil spiked and the Cboe volatility index rose nearly 20% on fresh Middle East tensions after the US said it shot down an Iranian drone.\n\nInvestors fear that higher oil prices could weigh on the US economy by causing renewed upward pressure on inflation. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 2% to about $67.50 a barrel, reflecting an 11% increase from its low in December. US oil prices were also up 2% to about $63.50 a barrel.\n\nThe major indexes sank into the red in the early afternoon, but pared the deepest losses. The Dow clawed back much of its drop of more than 500 points and the Nasdaq ended lower by 1.4% after declining by over 2% during the session.\n\n\"The enthusiasm for AI rolls through peaks and valleys,\" Louis Naveillier, the chairman of Naveillier & Associates, wrote in a note on Tuesday during the tech sell-off. \"These higher energy prices will add to inflation pressure,\" he added of the move higher in oil.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were the big moves in the tech sector:\n\nMega-cap tech stocks have been front-of-mind all week as more companies report results for the fourth quarter. Some tech giants, like Microsoft, plunged as investors continue to express concerns over how much firms are spending on artificial intelligence without a clear outlook for how huge capex will translate into returns.\n\nInvestors had been keeping a closer eye on oil prices this year amid geopolitical tensions between the US and other major crude producers, like Venezuela and Iran. In January, some forecasters were eyeing the possibility of an oil shock, a situation where crude prices jump due to supply disruptions, hurting economic activity.",

    "fullText": "The government shutdown is ending. But the fight over funding for the Department of Homeland Security is far from over.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a package of funding bills on Tuesday afternoon that will end the four-day partial government shutdown.\n\nIt's still not clear how DHS will be funded in the long run.\n\nFunding for the department runs out on Friday, February 13, and Republicans have yet to agree to changes to immigration enforcement that Democrats are demanding in exchange for supporting the funding.\n\nWithout an agreement, several government agencies will go unfunded, and if no bill to fund DHS passes for a long time, workers could miss paychecks.\n\nIt would also affect other agencies funded by the DHS bill, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Coast Guard.\n\nHowever, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would be impacted less than other agencies. Republicans voted to give $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July.\n\nIn the wake of Pretti's killing, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer laid out three key demands on ICE:\n\nIn a Tuesday statement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries backed up those points, while also calling for an \"end to the storming of sensitive locations like houses of worship, schools, and hospitals.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Republicans will agree to any of those demands, leaving open the possibility that Democrats won't support a future DHS funding bill.\n\nWhile that may not be an issue in the GOP-controlled House, it would allow Democrats to block the bill in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats but 60 votes are required to advance most bills.\n\nThe partial shutdown began on Friday, after Senate Democrats demanded changes to funding for DHS in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of spending bills that funded DHS, along with the Department of Defense, the State Department, the Treasury Department, and other agencies.\n\nSenators came together and agreed to negotiate changes, passing a new version of the spending package that extends DHS funding for only two weeks in order to give time for negotiations.\n\nBut that bill still had to clear the House again, and with the lower chamber not scheduled to come back into session until this week, funding for those agencies ran out at midnight on Friday.\n\nThis shutdown was only partial, affecting fewer parts of the federal government than the 43-day long shutdown that occurred in the fall.\n\nThat's because lawmakers have already passed bills to fund various parts of the government, including the departments that fund SNAP and WIC payments.",

    "fullText": "This story was produced by the Berks County bureau of Spotlight PA, an independent, nonpartisan newsroom. org/newsletters/gooddayberks.\n\nUPPER BERN — The Trump administration has quietly purchased a nearly 520,000-square-foot warehouse in Berks County as it plans to convert such facilities into immigration detention centers across the U.S.\n\nThe warehouse, located at 3501 Mountain Road in Upper Bern Township, was sold to the U.S. government on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for $87.4 million, deed records show. The purchase was recorded on Feb. 2.\n\nSpotlight PA visited the warehouse, which is located about a mile from I-78, on Jan. 15 and witnessed about two dozen individuals touring the exterior of the building. One man who arrived early to the site that day identified himself to a reporter as ICE.\n\nThe property was most recently called the Hamburg Logistics Center, and before that was the site of the Mountain Springs Arena, a county landmark known for rodeos and demolition derbies. It neighbors an Amazon warehouse and the Mountain Springs Camping Resort.\n\nThe building is one of at least 23 that ICE plans to convert into an immigration detention facility, Bloomberg reports. The Berks County warehouse could house up to 1,500 beds.\n\nICE also finalized the purchase of a warehouse in nearby Tremont Township, in Schuylkill County, on Monday, according to a deed. The Tremont property is located less than 300 yards from a daycare center and has already faced fierce resident opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE did not answer any questions about the Berks County warehouse purchase and instead lauded the agency’s targeting of “vicious criminals.”\n\n“Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE has new funding to expand detention space to keep these criminals off American streets before they are removed for good from our communities,” the spokesperson said.\n\nUpper Bern Township’s solicitor said in an emailed statement that community leaders learned about the sale on Monday. They declined to answer questions.\n\n“The township was not involved in this transfer and has not received any applications from either the prior or new owners regarding the future use of the property,” the statement reads. “The township has no further comment on this matter at this time.”\n\nState Sen. Chris Gebhard and Rep. Jamie Barton, Republicans who represent the area, said they have reached out to federal contacts to gather more information on how the Department of Homeland Security plans to use the warehouse.\n\n“Our immediate concerns include the potential loss of property tax revenue for the host municipality, county, and school district, as well as security and perimeter considerations,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement. “We look forward to engaging directly with the appropriate federal officials to address these issues. Once additional information is available, we will provide an update.”\n\nThe property is assessed at $22 million and currently pays $198,286 annually in county property taxes under the current tax rate of 9.013 mils. Combined with Hamburg Area School District and township taxes, the loss of tax revenue from the federal government’s purchase would be about $624,000.\n\nState Sen. Judy Schwank (D., Berks) declined to comment on the warehouse purchase on Monday. In an earlier interview with Spotlight PA, she called the then-potential sale “deeply concerning,” especially given the reports of mistreatment of people detained in ICE facilities. She released a statement about “ICE’s action in Minneapolis” on Jan. 27, shortly after federal agents killed Alex Pretti.\n\n“My concern is, knowing the track record of some of these other facilities located throughout the country, it’s not good,” she said. “I don’t necessarily want to see something like that being housed in our county.”\n\nThe deed finalized on Monday shows the property was sold to ICE by an LLC connected to PCCP, a national commercial real estate equity firm. The firm purchased the warehouse in 2024 for $57.5 million, deed records show.\n\nReached by phone Monday afternoon, PCCP partner Greg Eberhardt — who is the authorized signatory for 3501 Mountain Road Owner LLC on the latest deed — denied knowledge of the property and its sale, and refused to comment further.\n\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Eberhardt said before hanging up on a Spotlight PA reporter. “I’m not making company comments.”\n\nUpper Bern Township is situated on the edge of Berks and Schuylkill Counties, with a population of roughly 1,600 people. The community is mostly white, with only 2.8% of residents identifying as another race, according to the 2020 census.\n\nBridget Cambria, attorney with Aldea, a nonprofit that provides pro bono immigration legal services, said the detention center will have a “disruptive” and “chilling” impact on Berks County’s immigrant community.\n\n“If there are people that live freely and at peace knowing that they do the right thing, they can do their immigration process or stay with their family or figure out a way to legalize their status, they’re going to be more afraid to do that with a giant detention center in their backyard,” Cambria said.\n\nA 2022 study by the Detention Watch Center and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center found that immigrants were more likely to be arrested by ICE in counties with more detention bed-space.\n\nBEFORE YOU GO… If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

    "description": "Musk's memo announcing SpaceX and xAI's merger is full of space jargon. Here's your cheat sheet to bring the wonky language back down to Earth.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been shy about his inner nerd — just look at his SpaceX merger memo.\n\nOver the years, the billionaire has peppered his company communications with sci-fi culture Easter eggs, physics nerd jargon, and enough dad-joke flair to make comedian Nate Bargatze blush.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Musk's latest internal memo — announcing that SpaceX would merge with xAI — leaned into the kind of words and phrases that might cause you to scratch your head.\n\nIt reads less like a conventional corporate M&A announcement and more like a sci-fi manifesto, invoking \"sentient suns,\" orbital data centers, and humanity's destiny among the stars.\n\nForget \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" here is your hitchhiker's guide to Musk's memo.\n\nThe memo opens with a sci-fi banger, the kind of premise you'd find in a Hollywood script: Musk says his new vision for the combined company is to build a \"sentient sun.\"\n\nThe phrase is meant to convey scale. Musk is imagining an AI system so large, energy-hungry, and centralized that it metaphorically resembles a star. Except instead of radiating light and heat, this \"sun\" would beam computer-generated intelligence back to Earth.\n\nIt's a piece of sci-fi shorthand for extremely powerful, solar-fed AI.\n\nThis is where the memo goes full-on science nerd: \"Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization,\" Musk wrote.\n\nMusk is referencing the Kardashev scale, a '60s framework created by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev that ranks civilizations by the amount of energy they can harness. A Type I civilization can use all the energy available on its home planet. A Type II civilization can capture the full power output of its star.\n\nHumanity today is generally thought to sit somewhere below Type I.\n\nHere, Musk is proposing to move massive computing infrastructure — the power-hungry data centers popping up in rural America to fuel modern AI — off Earth and into orbit. In other words, data centers in space.\n\nIn space, he argues, those systems could rely on near-constant solar energy. As Musk put it elsewhere in the memo: \"It's always sunny in space.\"\n\nSpaceX essentially wants to build a floating gas station. Here, Musk describes a dedicated tanker-to-ship bot expected to roll out in 2026, per SpaceNews.\n\nRight now, rockets carry all of their fuel right from takeoff. This system would allow the company's spacecraft to optimize for other storage cabins.\n\nMusk is essentially a giant railgun designed to launch cargo into space using electricity instead of rocket fuel. It's reminiscent of an instrument in the 1937 science fiction novel \"Zero to Eighty.\"\n\nSpaceX is imagining building one on Earth's Moon, where lower gravity and the lack of an atmosphere would make it easier to fling materials into space.\n\nMusk ends the memo with a linguistic flourish.\n\nIt isn't the first time Musk has used the phrase. In 2014, he launched a Montessori-style school for children from 3 to 9 with the same name. The school's curriculum focused on STEM learning and problem-solving, according to its mission statement.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Small Business Administration said in a policy note that green card holders won't be allowed to apply for SBA loans, effective March 1.\n\nThe move is the latest by the SBA as it works to tighten loan restrictions and restructure the agency.\n\nLast year, it tightened a requirement that businesses applying for loans must be 100% owned by U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent residents, up from a 51% standard.\n\nIn December, it issued a policy note that said up to 5% of a business could be non-citizen owned. But the current policy rescinds that, as well as making lawful permanent residents ineligible, too.\n\n“The Trump SBA is committed to driving economic growth and job creation for American citizens – which is why, effective March 1, the agency will no longer guarantee loans for small businesses owned by foreign nationals,\" said SBA spokesperson Maggie Clemmons in an emailed statement. “Across every program, the SBA is ensuring that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to this agency goes to support U.S. job creators and innovators.”\n\nThe SBA doesn’t give out direct loans, except when they’re related to disasters, but it works with lenders to distribute loans to small businesses. The loans typically have better rates than traditional loans.\n\nSmall business advocacy group the Small Business Majority said the move is “a decision that will limit the growth of small businesses and jobs throughout the United States.”\n\n“The latest decision by SBA fails to recognize that immigrants are twice as likely to start a business as native-born U.S. citizens,” said Small Business Majority CEO John Arensmeyer. “Given that reality, SBA’s severe restrictions will have a negative impact on small business creation throughout this country for years to come.”",

    "fullText": "The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is investigating the death of fishing boat captain and reality TV star Gus Sanfilippo, who died last week when his vessel capsized in Massachusetts (per CBS News).\n\nSanfilippo was the veteran captain of the Lilly Jean, which operated out of Gloucester, and a cast member on the reality show Nor’Easter Men. He died along with five of his fellow crew members and a NOAA fisheries observer when the 72-foot vessel capsized on Friday night as temperatures dipped to approximately 12 degrees Fahrenheit. The other victims have been identified as father and son Paul Beal Sr. and Paul Beal Jr.; John Rousanidis; Freeman Short; Sean Thierren; and 22-year-old NOAA observer Jada Sammitt, who recently graduated from an environmental biology program.\n\nThe Coast Guard will oversee the investigation from this point on. “The purpose of a Coast Guard investigation is to identify measures that can improve the safety of life and property at sea, not to assign civil or criminal blame,” said Lt. Cmdr. Brett Igo, the USCG Northeast District investigation oversight coordinator. Igo added that the investigation is expected to last several months, and that information will be released to the public as it becomes available.\n\nRescue officials responded to a distress call at around 7 a.m. local time on Jan. 30 roughly 25 miles off the coast of Cape Ann. After officials were unable to make contact with the crew, the Coast Guard issued an emergency alert and sent a helicopter along with a boat crew to the location. Rescuers found one person dead floating amongst debris of the Lilly Jean, though they have not confirmed whose body was found. Search and rescue efforts were suspended the following day after workers had searched a 1,000-square-mile radius and exhausted all efforts. All of the boat's seven occupants were officially declared dead later that day.\n\n“The decision to suspend the search was incredibly difficult,” said Capt. Jamie Frederick, commander of Coast Guard Sector Boston. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all the family members and friends of the lost crew of the Lilly Jean, and with the entire Gloucester community during this heartbreaking time.”\n\nSebastian Noto, a fellow fisherman who worked closely with Sanfillipo, told NBC Boston that he spoke with his friend just hours before his death. “‘I quit. It’s too cold,’” Sanfilippo reportedly told Noto. “He was calm. He just couldn’t do the cold because the air holes were freezing.” “I was about 30 miles east of him,” Noto continued. “We usually work together all the time. We are like glue, man. We give a lot of information back-and-forth.”",

    "fullText": "The post Australia Imported 2,400 Toads to Save Its Crops—Now 200 Million of Them are an Unstoppable Disaster appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nQuick Take\nCane toads were introduced to Australia in 1935 to control sugarcane beetles, but the toads ignore the beetles while decimating the ecosystem they were meant to protect.\nInstead, they became a highly toxic invasive species with no natural predators.\nCane toads threaten many native reptiles, mammals, birds, and amphibians.\nDespite decades of effort, large-scale control of cane toads remains nearly impossible.\n\nIn 1935, native beetles were wreaking havoc on Australia’s sugar cane crops in Queensland. The beetle larvae lived in the soil and chewed on sugarcane roots, stunting growth or killing the plants. Seeking a natural solution to kill the grubs, the Australian government imported cane toads from Hawaii, with the hope that the toads would eat the grubs and save the sugarcane. Unfortunately, the worst-case scenario occurred. The toads did not keep the beetle populations in check. Instead, they became one of Australia’s most destructive invasive species and an ecological disaster.\n\nSugarcane had become a key crop in Queensland in the late 1800s. Settlers found that Queensland’s humid and warm climate was ideal for growing the plant. However, farmers faced a battle with the grubs of native beetles, especially the greyback cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum), as the larvae were eating the roots of the sugarcane and decimating crops. To help the farmers, the government established the Queensland Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES) in 1900.\n\nEntomologists working for the BSES studied multiple methods for controlling the beetles, finally settling on a relatively new science: biological control. At the time, entomologists were experimenting with the new idea of bringing in natural predators to control pests. Thus entered the cane toad.\n\nCane toads (Rhinella marina) are the largest toads in the world. They are opportunistic predators and eat a diet of insects, small animals, plants, and even pet food and garbage. Cane toads grow up to 10 inches long and weigh up to 4 pounds. These massive toads are also highly poisonous, even as eggs and tadpoles. The toads secrete a toxic substance called bufotoxin, which can kill animals that try to eat them and can irritate the skin or burn the eyes of humans who handle them.\n\nAs you can imagine, introducing cane toads to Queensland brought more problems than they solved. Cane toads are native to Central and South America. However, in the 1920s and 30s, they were introduced around the world to control pests. Today, they are considered invasive species in Australia, the Caribbean islands, Hawaii, and Florida.\n\nIn August 1935, the BSES released 2,400 cane toads into sugarcane plantations in Gordonvale, North Queensland. This wasn’t a well-thought-out plan. According to the National Museum Australia, “Remarkably, no studies of the potential impact on the environment had been carried out. Nor had the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations even determined whether the toad would actually eat the cane beetles.”\n\nThe cane toads thrived in the warm environment. However, they did nothing to control the beetles. Today, beetle grubs are controlled on sugarcane farms with the use of soil-based insecticides.\n\nAccording to the Queensland Government, 75 species of Australian crocodiles, lizards, and freshwater turtles are threatened by the toads. Some of the animals that are in danger of dying after they eat a cane toad include Australian monitor lizards, quolls, tiger snakes, and freshwater crocodiles. Many of these animals are designated as threatened species.\n\nA research study showed that native tadpoles suffered mass mortality shortly after the toads were introduced to Queensland. The study found 1,300 tadpoles from 10 different species had died in one season. Birds are also affected by the toads. For example, cane toads eat the eggs and nestlings of the rainbow bee-eater bird. Research has shown that cane toads have caused a third of the bee-eaters’ nests to fail.\n\nFinally, cane toads have an indirect effect on native species by changing the ecosystem when they arrive in an area. The toads have large appetites and eat many insects. Eventually, the invertebrate population begins to dwindle, which reduces the amount of resources for other species. These cascading changes can have broad implications for complex food webs.\n\nCane toads have no natural predators or diseases that threaten them in Australia. In Central and South America, they are kept in check by natural predators that evolved along with them. For example, many South American snakes are either immune or have some level of immunity to the bufotoxin of the cane toad.\n\nAlso, cane toads are opportunistic feeders and will eat just about anything, even pet food and people’s trash. They breed opportunistically, usually during warm and wet conditions, and can reproduce multiple times a year. Females lay 8,000 to 30,000 eggs at a time. To understand how cane toad populations can explode, consider that most native Australian frogs lay around 1,000 to 2,000 eggs in an entire year.\n\nExperts offer ways to control cane toads if they are found in a small area or a small pond. They suggest collecting and disposing of cane toad eggs from the water or humanely disposing of the adult toads. Community groups offer information on how to recognize adult cane toads and humanely remove them from the environment. However, these control measures are only feasible for small areas and cannot be applied to large populations of cane toads.\n\nDespite the challenges, researchers are looking for novel ways to control the toads. Scientists found they can edit a cane toad egg’s DNA to stop it from growing beyond a tadpole. If scientists can find a way to gene-edit large numbers of eggs, they may have found a solution to control the cane toad population’s growth.\n\nIn another study, scientists had success in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in freshwater crocodiles. Some populations of crocodiles in Australia have declined by more than 70% due to poisoning from ingesting cane toads. In the study, researchers placed cane toad carcasses with the toxin removed, but a nausea-inducing chemical was added. While crocodiles at control sites continued to eat and become sick from poisoned cane toads, those at the treatment sites stopped trying to eat cane toads.\n\nAnother project that began as a citizen science initiative involves a tadpole trap design that can catch thousands of tadpoles. And in an effort to protect the Pilbara from the hopping invaders, scientists are looking into ways to prevent the toads from accessing water. Cane toads cannot survive more than a few days without access to water.\n\nThe post Australia Imported 2,400 Toads to Save Its Crops—Now 200 Million of Them are an Unstoppable Disaster appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Immigration officers with guns drawn arrested activists who were trailing their vehicles on Tuesday in Minneapolis, while education leaders described anxiety and fear in Minnesota schools from the ongoing federal sweeps.\n\nBoth are signs that tension remains in the Minneapolis area after the departure of high-profile commander Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol and the arrival of Trump administration border czar Tom Homan, which followed the fatal shooting of protester Alex Pretti.\n\n“There’s less smoke on the ground,” Gov. Tim Walz said, referring to tear gas and other irritants used by officers against protesters, “but I think it’s more chilling than it was last week because of the shift to the schools, the shift to the children.”\n\nAt least one person who had an anti-ICE message on clothing was handcuffed while face-down on the ground. An Associated Press photographer witnessed the arrests.\n\nICE agents are changing their tactics\n\nFederal agents in the Twin Cities lately have been conducting more targeted immigration arrests at homes and neighborhoods, rather than staging in parking lots. The convoys have been harder to find and less aggressive. Alerts in activist group chats have been more about sightings than immigration-related detainments.\n\nSeveral cars followed officers through south Minneapolis after there were reports of them knocking at homes. Officers stopped their vehicles and ordered activists to come out of a car at gunpoint. Agents told reporters at the scene to stay back and threatened to use pepper spray.\n\nHomeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said agents detained the activists because they hindered efforts to arrest a man who is in the country illegally.\n\nA federal judge last month put limits on how officers treat motorists who are following them but not obstructing their operations. Safely following agents “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge said. An appeals court, however, set the order aside.\n\nBovino, who was leading immigration enforcement in Minneapolis and other big U.S. cities, left town last week, shortly after Pretti's death became the second local killing of a U.S. citizen in January.\n\nHoman, who was dispatched to Minnesota to succeed Bovino, has warned that protesters could face consequences if they interfere with officers.\n\nOperation Metro Surge affecting schools\n\nWalz and education leaders held a news conference to say the presence of immigration officers is frightening some school communities. Brenda Lewis, superintendent of Fridley Public Schools in suburban Minneapolis, said she has been followed twice by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since speaking publicly on Jan. 27 and that school board members have had ICE vehicles outside their homes.\n\nLewis, a U.S. citizen, said she has seen SUVs with tinted windows, multiple masked people inside and out-of-state license plates. She goes on neighborhood patrols near schools with a security guard.\n\n“Students are afraid to come to school, parents are afraid to drop them off,” Lewis said. “Staff are coming to work wondering if today will be the day something happens in one of our buildings.”\n\nShe said Fridley, which has Somali and Ecuadorian families, has added security, adjusted drop-off procedures and increased mental health support. Tracy Xiong, a social worker in the Columbia Heights district, said she has been coordinating grocery deliveries to school families and finding volunteers to drive children.\n\nThere was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Department of Homeland Security and ICE about the concerns of educators.\n\nGrand jury seeks communications, records\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday was the deadline for Minneapolis to produce information for a federal grand jury. It is part of a U.S. Justice Department request for records of any effort to stifle the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Officials have denounced it as a bullying tactic.\n\n“We have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, but when the federal government weaponizes the criminal justice system against political opponents, it’s important to stand up and fight back,” said Ally Peters, spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat.\n\nShe said the city was complying, but she didn't elaborate. Other state and local offices run by Democrats were given subpoenas, though it is not known whether they had the same deadline. People familiar with the matter have told the AP that the subpoenas are related to an investigation into whether Minnesota officials obstructed enforcement through public statements.\n\nNo release for man in Omar incident\n\nElsewhere, a man charged with squirting apple cider vinegar on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar will remain in jail. U.S. Magistrate Judge David Schultz granted a federal prosecutor's request to keep Anthony Kazmierczak in custody.\n\n“We simply cannot have protesters and people — whatever side of the aisle they’re on — running up to representatives who are conducting official business, and holding town halls, and assaulting them,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Bejar said Tuesday.\n\nDefense attorney John Fossum said the vinegar posed a low risk to Omar. He said Kazmierczak's health problems weren't being properly addressed in jail and that his release would be appropriate.\n\nOrder for release of 2 men accused of assaulting ICE officer fails to stick\n\nAnother judge ordered the release of two Venezuelan men who were accused of assaulting an ICE officer, but ICE officials quickly took them back into custody.\n\nAlfredo Aljorna and Julio Sosa-Celis are accused of assaulting the officer the night of Jan. 14. Sosa-Celis was shot in the thigh by the officer during the encounter, triggering protests in Minneapolis.\n\nThe officer said he was struck with a broom and snow shovel while trying to subdue and arrest Aljorna after a car crash and foot chase. But the two men deny assaulting the officer. Neither video evidence nor three eyewitnesses supported the officer’s account.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson held a hearing Tuesday at which he rejected the government’s appeal of a magistrate judge’s order for the release of the two men on the criminal charges. Magnuson ruled that they could go free.\n\nBut an attorney for Sosa-Celis, Robin Wolpert, said in an interview that when she went to speak afterward with her client, who had been in the custody of U.S. Marshals, staff told her that ICE had taken him. She said she wasn’t sure why, or what their next steps would be.\n\nAljorna's attorney, Frederick Goetz, said he didn't know why ICE took his client or their next steps either.\n\nRaza reported from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

    "title": "10 Hacks Every AirPods User Should Know",
    "description": "There are hacks for AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and, well, AirPods.",
    "fullText": "Since their initial launch in 2016, Apple has released nine iteration of the AirPods, from the now iconic white earbuds, to the upgraded AirPods Pro, to the the AirPods Max, Apple's pricey take on over-the-ear headphones. Whatever the model, however, these things are meant to be simple: You open the case, tap a prompt on your iPhone, and presto, your AirPods are ready to go.\n\nDespite their ease of use, however, AirPods are packed with features and settings you can adjust to your liking. Here are 10 hacks you should know if you own a pair Apple's headphones, whether standard, Pro, or Max. (A note: Whenever I refer to \"AirPods settings\" in this article, I am generally referring to the options that appear in the first page of the Settings app on iOS and iPadOS, or the System Settings on macOS, when you're wearing your AirPods.)\n\nI've had a few AirPods in my day, and every time I set up a new pair, I turn on \"Off\" mode. That might read strange, but it's a real thing. Depending on your AirPods model, you might have the option to use Noise Cancellation, which, of course, blocks outside noise; Transparency, which pumps in the sounds around you; or Off, which activates neither. This last choice ends up being great for times you want some noise blockage, but want to preserve the battery of your AirPods. Though I can't speak to AirPods 4 With Noise Cancellation, the Pros and the Max do a good job with this without active noise cancellation.\n\nWhile this option is always present when switching noise modes from Control Center, by default, Apple doesn't include it from switching modes from the stem (or the noise control button on the AirPods Max). If you try to switch, you'll only move between Noise Cancellation and Transparency. To include \"Off\" in this list, you'll need to dig into your AirPods' settings. Scroll down to \"Press and Hold AirPods,\" then choose either \"Left\" or \"Right,\" depending on which AirPods you want to adjust. Here, make sure \"Off\" is selected to add it to the noise control rotation.\n\nLike any other tiny tech, your AirPods will go missing eventually. Mine slip out of my pockets all the time, and usually end up on the floor or under couch cushions. In such cases, you can waste your time retracing your steps and calculating the physics of where your AirPods would have landed, or you could use Find My to find them much faster.\n\nFind My has a few ways to locate your missing AirPods. The first is the most obvious: When you open the app and choose the \"Devices\" tab, you'll see your AirPods last-known location on the map. If you left them behind at, say, someone's house, you'll likely see that here, and know to stop looking under your own furniture. But if you're already in the location Find My says your AirPods are, you have two more tools to pinpoint their whereabouts.\n\nFirst, you can use \"Find\" to get step-by-step instructions on where your AirPods are. If you have AirPods Pro 2 or 3, you'll even have an arrow pointing you in their direction. If you still can't find them, you can tap \"Play Sound\" to play a sound out of any loose AirPod. If you have AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3, you can play a sound on the case itself.\n\nAirPods work best with Apple devices, but that doesn't mean they're exclusive. You can connect your AirPods to any device that supports Bluetooth, which gives the headphones some added flexibility. I primarily use mine with my iPhone, Mac, and Apple TV, but I also connect them directly to the TV itself to use them with my PS5. (Sony's console doesn't support Bluetooth audio, for some reason.)\n\nThe thing is, there's no obvious way to connect your AirPods to non-Apple devices. You'd only know if you looked up how to put your particular AirPods model into \"pairing mode.\" This bypasses Apple's usual pairing system, and opens up your AirPods to any available Bluetooth source. Here's how to kick your AirPods into pairing mode:\n\nAirPods 1, 2, or 3, or AirPods Pro 1 or 2: Place your AirPods in the case, open the lid, then press and hold the button on the back for five seconds, or until the light starts flashing white.\n\nAirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 3: Place your AirPods in their case, hold the case next to the Bluetooth device, then double-tap the front of the case. The light should start flashing white.\n\nAirPods Max; Press and hold the noise control button (the longer button) for about five seconds, until the light starts flashing white.\n\nIt's easy to be numb to the current state of technology, but the fact your AirPods can translate conversations on the fly is possibly the best encapsulation of \"we're living in the future\" of any consumer product right now. AirPods aren't the only earbuds that can do this, but if you have AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, you have the power to have a full conversation with someone who doesn't speak the same language you do.\n\nYou can't just find yourself in a situation where you need Live Translation and use it right away, however. Before you can use the feature, you need to download the target language to your iPhone. To start, go to your AirPods' settings, then scroll down to \"Translation (Beta)\" and choose \"Languages.\" Here, you can tap any of the available languages to download them to your iPhone, which currently include Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified), Chinese (Mandarin, Traditional), English (UK), English (US), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain).\n\nNow, when you need it, you can press the stems of your AirPods at once to launch Live Translate. Alternatively, you can open the Translate app, then choose \"Live,\" then choose the language of the other speaker, as well as your own language. As they speak, you'll hear the translation in your AirPods, and see the text of the translation on your iPhone's display.\n\nFor well over a year now, AirPods have been cleared by the FDA as clinical-grade hearing aids. It might take other people some time to catch up to the look, but if you need them, the AirPods you already own can be as valid a choice as dedicated (and expensive) hearing aids—assuming your have AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Pro 3.\n\nIn order to take advantage of this perk, you'll either need to take a hearing test through your iPhone, or upload an audiogram you performed with an audiologist. You'll find these options in your AirPods' settings under \"Hearing Assistance.\"\n\nAdaptive Audio is one of my favorite things about modern AirPods. If you have AirPods Pro 2, AirPods Pro 3, or AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio will either boost or cap external sounds, depending on how loud or soft those sounds are, while still letting you hear everything that's going on around you.\n\nBut if you've been using Adaptive Mode, and don't care for Apple's default sound levels here, you can adjust them to either let in more or less sound. You'll find the option in your AirPods settings under \"Adaptive Audio.\" Here, slide the slider left to block more sound, or right to let in more noise. After a moment, you'll hear the changes take effect, so you can test which setting sounds best to you.\n\nBack in the day, when you actually had to buy a dedicated camera for photography or videography, that device usually came with a remote so you could snap a picture or start recording while the camera was set up on a tripod. While the selfie has largely killed that practice, there are still plenty of times when you'd benefit from a camera remote for your iPhone, especially if you're trying to capture a group shot with no extra photographer, or you want to record a video without physically touching your phone.\n\nIf you have AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3, you can use your earbuds as remote for your iPhone's camera. To set it up, open your AirPods' settings, scroll down, then tap \"Camera Remote.\" You can either choose \"Press Once\" to have a quick press act as a remote button press, or \"Press and Hold\" to have a long-press achieve the same. Note that this will affect how your AirPods respond in other circumstances: If you choose \"Press Once,\" you can't use the stem to control media playback; if you choose Press and Hold, you can't use the stem to activate Siri.\n\n\"Smart\" tech tries to solve problems, but, often, only makes them worse. AirPods' \"Personalized Volume\" is one such example. The problem: When your environment is too noisy, you can't hear your music; and when things suddenly get quiet, your music might be too loud. So, this feature \"intelligently\" adjusts the volume based on how quiet or loud your surroundings are. In theory, that's great; in execution, it's a nightmare. Since I picked up a pair of AirPods Pro 3, I've wondered why my music suddenly gets quiet, or suddenly starts getting louder, without me doing anything to control the volume. If the feature works for you, you can keep it on, but if you're like me, you'll want this off.\n\nTo disable it, head to AirPods settings, scroll down to \"Audio,\" then turn off the toggle next to \"Personalized Volume.\"\n\nYour AirPods are basically fancy Bluetooth headsets. If you're wearing them, and you get an incoming call, you don't need to pull out your iPhone. Instead, you can answer that call by pressing an AirPod stem once. But you might not also know you have the ability to customize other stem controls while on the call. By default, pressing the stem once during a call acts as a mute and unmute switch, while pressing twice ends the call. But you can swap these controls if you want to. You'll find them in your AirPods' settings under \"Call Controls.\"\n\nYou can use the stem of your AirPods to do things like accept incoming calls or dismiss notifications. However, if your hands are full, you can also use your head to do the same. AirPods 4, AirPods Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 3 support Head Gestures, which lets you nod your head or shake it from side to side to either accept or decline a call, or reply to (or dismiss) a text.\n\nYou'll need to have Announce Calls and Announce Notifications enabled for this feature to work. You'll find those settings in your iPhone's \"Siri\" or \"Apple Intelligence & Siri\" setting pages. Once enabled, you can go to your AirPods' settings, scroll down to \"Head Gestures,\" then enable the toggle to turn on the feature. From here, you can assign the \"Accept, Reply\" and \"Decline, Dismiss\" actions to either a head nod, or a head shake.",

    "description": "Don't click to claim your \"expiring\" rewards.",
    "fullText": "A new phishing campaign identified by Malwarebytes Labs targets AT&T customers with text messages about expiring rewards points. Users are urged to claim their rewards ASAP by clicking the included link, which is actually designed to harvest sensitive personal information.\n\nTargets for this scam have received texts containing a \"Rewards Expiration Notice\" urging them to redeem points in their AT&T account before they are scheduled to expire. The message includes a specific points balance and expiration date along with two \"recommended redemption methods\":\n\nAT&T Rewards Center: [shorturl link]\n\nAT&T Mobile App: Rewards section\n\nAs Malwarebytes discovered, the short link sends users to a https://att.hgfxp[.]cc/pay/, a spoofed website with AT&T branding, headers, menus, and links out to the real AT&T domain. Users are directed to enter their phone number to verify their account, which leads to a screen warning that their points are set to expire. Further down, you can see redemption options, including an Apple Watch Series 9, Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones, and Amazon gift cards.\n\nIn order to claim a reward and arrange delivery, victims are then prompted to enter more personal information—which is transmitted directly to the scammers. Malwarebytes notes that the forms have real-time validation and error highlighting so users are less likely to suspect the fraud.\n\nThis scam relies on social engineering tactics—like a sense of urgency and the fear of missing out—to trick targets into engaging. And while it does have a somewhat believable look and feel as well as a multi-step approach to build user trust, it also has some clear red flags. The text originates from a regular phone number rather than a short code, which is often used for automated messages, and the sender doesn't appear as a recognized AT&T contact. The thread also includes multiple recipients and a generic greeting. (A legitimate message from AT&T will be sent directly to you.)\n\nThen there's the shortened URL that leads to a website not owned by AT&T. While the page has some realistic branding and working links, it also has a number of typos and grammatical and formatting errors. Malwarebytes found that if you click the link on different days, the expiration date on the site changes.\n\nAs always, don't click links in unsolicited texts. AT&T does have a rewards program, but you should go directly to that portal via the web or app to manage your rewards.",

    "title": "What's the Difference Between the 'Surface Web' and the 'Deep Web'?",
    "description": "These are two very different sides to the internet.",
    "fullText": "In 2024, the world wide web was made up of 149 zettabytes of data. That's 149 trillion gigabytes, or 149 billion terabytes—whichever helps you wrap your head around that gigantic number. Suffice it to say, the internet is a big place. It's so big, in fact, that you can't access all of it the same way. There are actually different tiers to the web, and depending on with tier a piece of content you're looking for is on, you may or may not be able to view it—even if you know where to find it.\n\nThat's the crux of the difference between the \"surface\" web, and the \"deep\" web. These are two separate parts of the internet that are also part of the larger world wide web. While these two tiers are quite different, you've visited content on both of them before. In fact, you likely visited both surface web pages and deep web pages today, multiple times, without ever realizing it.\n\nThe surface web, also known as the visible web, is really true to its name: This is the part of the web you can easily access through search engines, as they are indexed by platforms like Google. As a rule of thumb, if you can google it, it's on the surface web. The article you're reading right now is on the surface web, for example. Maybe you found it by searching \"difference between surface web and deep web\" on Google. The same applies to Lifehacker as a whole, as well as articles on websites like Mashable, CNET, and PCMag.\n\nYou likely spend a good amount of your internet time on the surface web, on websites both old and new. Forums like Reddit are largely fully represented on the surface web, as are some Instagram pages. Listings for products you can buy on websites like Amazon and Best Buy are surface web pages. Video platforms like YouTube are very much the surface web, including TikTok—though the experience for the latter is not optimized for web browsers. Legacy websites like AddictingGames (which is still playable in 2026), as well as the site for the 1996 movie Space Jam are the surface web. A lot of the surface web is made of up individual articles, which makes sense, since articles still make up a large amount of search engine results.\n\nLike the surface of the ocean, the surface web is just a fraction of the internet as a whole. Back in 2017, some estimates claimed the surface web made up just 10% of the entire internet. That's still a huge number of websites, which tells you how big the overall web really is.\n\nIf the surface web is everything you can find via Google, the deep web is everything you can't. The deep web is much larger than the surface web, and is compromised of websites that are not readily accessible from search engines or direct URLs. They're often locked away behind authentication. That means you need at least a username and password to access them, and in many cases, they require an additional form of authentication as well. The article you're reading is on the surface web, but the software (content management system, or CMS) we use to write and publish the article is not—our CMS is still a website, but it's not something you can find in a Google search, and even if you knew the direct URL, you wouldn't have access.\n\nIt's the same with the many sites you access that only you have permission to view. Think about something like Gmail: The service's homepage is accessible to everyone, and it's something that pops up when searching \"Gmail,\" but to access your Gmail inbox, you need to log in. Once you do, your inbox is accessible via the website, but it's not like anyone can see it with a URL, and they certainly can't find your inbox from a Google search. It's the same story with your Facebook feed, YouTube account, or your banking information. These are all accessible in your web browser as websites, but you need to log in to view them.\n\nThat's also the case for services and subscriptions. Think about stuff like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO: These are all accessible in your web browser, which means you're streaming the content on individual web pages. But the players on those web pages cannot be accessed from Google, even if the landing pages for a particular show or movie can be. In order to actually watch or listen to the content, you need to sign into your account. That's not the case with all streaming services, of course: Happy Gilmore on Tubi is a surface web page, since it's indexed on Google. Some of the deep web is also made up of pages you'll never see, such as protocols for identifying user accounts and running payments behind the scenes. It's not all paywalled content.\n\nMaybe you've also heard about the dark web, but don't quite know what it is. As such, you might conflate the deep web and the dark web, but the two are not identical. In fact, the dark web is a part of the deep web; it's just the part you can't access with a traditional web browser. In order to access the dark web, you need a specialized browser, like Tor, and knowledge of the unique dark web URLs, which typically end in .onion instead of .com or .org.",

    "title": "YouTube Just Blocked This Popular Hack for Free Background Play",
    "description": "A third-party browser might not be enough to replace a YouTube Premium subscription anymore.",
    "fullText": "For Christmas, I got my husband and myself YouTube Premium, and as much as I hate paying for yet another streaming service, it's pretty dang nice. There's ad-blocking, sure, but there are also other bonuses, like additional playback speed options and audio that continues to play in the background when you lock your phone. However, some users have developed hacks to get a few of these features without a subscription, believing they should be included with the site's free tier rather than being locked behind a paywall. Google's been cracking down on ad blockers for a while, but now it's coming after another common YouTube hack—free background play.\n\nPerforming this hack was simple. In many cases, you simply needed to watch YouTube in a non-Chrome browser (and definitely not the official YouTube app). Samsung Internet, for instance, had free YouTube background play officially built-in, with the company even publishing official tutorials on how to use it. Brave also offered this feature, as did Vivaldi. If your browser didn't support free background play by default, you could also usually find an extension for it.\n\nUnfortunately, according to reporting from Android Authority, the hack no longer seems to work in most cases. Toward the end of January, the site noticed that users across Samsung Internet, Brave, and Microsoft Edge complained that free background play no longer worked for them, even when enabled in their browsers or through an extension. Now Google has responded to a question sent by the publication, confirming that it purposefully broke free background play in third-party browsers, whether enabled in the browser's settings or through an extension.\n\n\"Background playback is a feature intended to be exclusive for YouTube Premium members,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"While some non-Premium users may have previously been able to access this through mobile web browsers in certain scenarios, we have updated the experience to ensure consistency across all out platforms.\"\n\nWell, dang. I've reached out to Google for additional comment, but it seems the eye of Sauron is upon us. Google is now officially cracking down on more than ad blocking.\n\nThat said, while Google's efforts do seem to be affecting many users, not everyone is unable to access background play without paying. One user said it's now been re-enabled on Brave, and I can confirm that I'm able to access it on Safari with my iPhone using the Vinegar extension.\n\nIt's unclear how long these efforts will remain operational, but at least we've now been able to diagnose a cause. Free YouTube background play didn't break on accident, and that means developers and users will have to be extra crafty to keep the hack alive in the future.",

    "description": "You clothes don't have to reek, nor does your shaker bottle.",
    "fullText": "Does your gym bag reek? You’re not alone, but it doesn’t have to be this way. With proper care, you can keep your workout gear stink-free. The key is to do yourself a favor and start taking care of everything before it starts to smell. But even if you’ve already let things get bad, I have some tips for you.\n\nI'll get into specifics below, but first, it can help to understand why the gym stink develops on clothing and other items that contact your skin. You sweat into them, but it's not the sweat itself that is the problem. It's the bacteria that feed on your sweat. So you'll need to either get rid of the sweat before the bacteria can grow, or handle your clothes and gear in a way that the bacteria won't be able to grow. (It's the same deal with shaker bottles, except substitute food residue for sweat.) If you take nothing else away from this article, just remember this: for the love of God, rinse everything immediately, or at least air your shit out.\n\nA lot of gym clothes these days are made of synthetic fabrics because they provide stretch or sweat-wicking features to keep us comfortable. The downside is that bacteria can cling to synthetic fibers in a way that makes them nearly impossible to wash off. So it’s important that we don’t let those germ colonies grow in the first place.\n\nThe bacteria I’m talking about are the ones that digest your sweat and skin oils. I know, gross. But that means it’s not the sweat itself that causes stinking, but rather the bacteria that multiply while your sweaty shirt is sitting in the laundry basket.\n\nNip this problem in the bud by rinsing the sweat out of synthetics as soon as you take them off. I do this in the shower, squeezing out each garment and hanging it to dry. A set of extra shower curtain hooks will give you a place to hang them. I put up a basic tension rod in the back of my shower for exactly this reason. If you shower at the gym, squeeze those garments out and roll them up in your towel until you get home.\n\nIf you can't rinse your gym clothes right after wearing, or if you have a whole workday in between your shower and your access to laundry, air your clothes out. Cotton clothes don’t have these problems, by the way. If you wear cotton socks or t-shirts, they can be chucked into the laundry whenever and however you like.\n\nYou may never be able to completely remove the stink, but you’ll have the best luck with detergents that contain enzymes or that bill themselves as being good for “sport” or “performance” fabrics. I’ve had good experiences with both Hex (a detergent) and Lysol laundry sanitizer (which you add to the rinse, like a fabric softener). I use one or the other, not both. Either of these can also be used for a soak: soak your gross clothes in a bucket with the Hex or Lysol laundry sanitizer, and then wash as usual.\n\nAnd for a finishing touch, if you really want to be sure you've gotten the stink out, hang the clothes outdoors (or lay them on a surface, like your deck) on a sunny day. Fresh air helps, and sunlight really does kill some of those stench-producing bacteria.\n\nLook, you can try baking soda or vinegar (not together), but I haven't found those to help. If you want a chemical answer to your problems, just get a bottle of Hex.\n\nWhat about things that can’t be quickly rinsed and dried, like your shoes and the gym bag itself? Or, worse, your neoprene knee sleeves? These items stink up most easily when they stay damp and warm. If you wanted to make a gym bag smell as much as possible, I would tell you to fill it with sweaty gear, lock it in the trunk of your car, forget about it until the next gym day. So if that’s your habit already, stop it. You need to air those suckers out.\n\nIf your bag has a mesh compartment for sweaty gear, make use of it. And if you can tie objects to the outsides of the bag—hanging your shoes by their laces, for example—that will help, too. But ultimately what you really want to do is open up the bag as soon as you get home. I always make sure that if my knee sleeves are deep inside the bag, I bring them up to the top to make sure they can get some air. And my shoes are in a mesh compartment, but if I have an extra minute, I’ll open up that compartment and loosen up the shoes so they get as much air flow as possible.\n\nMost of the things in your gym bag can be washed, but check manufacturer’s instructions for the best methods. For example, SBD says to hand wash knee sleeves with soap or a wetsuit detergent, but not to put them in the washing machine or dry them with heat.\n\nJust as with clothes, another good option is to hang or lay out your items in the sunshine and fresh air for a few hours. Sunlight will kill some bacteria, and a good airing-out never hurts.\n\nAvoid spraying things down with vinegar (I’ve never found this to be effective), rubbing alcohol (degrades some materials, so check with the manufacturer), or vodka (unnecessarily expensive, just buy rubbing alcohol and then see above about why you might not want to use rubbing alcohol).\n\nFinally, we come to the bane of many a gym bro’s existence, the stinky shaker cup. If you leave residue from your protein shake in there—especially a milk-based one, like a shake made with whey powder—it can go rancid, and the smells can seep into the plastic where they may never really go away.\n\nTo prevent this, rinse your shaker cup immediately after you drink the shake. Don’t tell yourself you’ll do it when you get home, because we all know you won’t, and honestly, that's too late anyway. You don’t have to fully wash the cup at this point, just rinse it out in the bathroom sink. Or do what I do, and chug your shake at home, over the sink, and wash the cup while it’s still in your hand.\n\nYour Hail Mary hope is to wash it really well. Use soap and hot water. Soak it for a bit if you like. Scrub all the little nooks and crannies (like where the spout meets its cap) to make sure no residue is left. Air it out to dry for a few days; you can even try the sunlight trick above. But if that doesn’t work, buy a new shaker cup, and treat this one right.",

    "fullText": "After nearly six years and four failed semi-finals, Arsenal's 4-2 aggregate victory over Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final has put them back into a major final.\n\nIt will be their first under Mikel Arteta since he guided them to FA Cup victory in 2020 - and just their second in his time at the club.\n\nIt was tight, it was tense and it was pretty dull at times but, as Kai Havertz rolled in an injury-time goal to confirm their place at Wembley, the euphoria from fans and players alike at Emirates left you in no doubt about the significance.\n\nIn a match that saw both sides only manage two shots on target each, the Gunners rarely looked troubled as they showed all the qualities that have made them so hard to beat.\n\nThe result means Arsenal will compete in a ninth EFL Cup final when they take on either Manchester City or Newcastle on Sunday, 22 March in the tournament's showpiece match.\n\nShould they face City, it will be a repeat of the 2018 final, won by the Manchester club, when Arteta was part of Pep Guardiola's coaching staff.\n\nHowever, aside from it being an opportunity for Arsenal to gain a measure of revenge for that loss and winning their first League Cup for 33 years, it would also be a step towards changing a few perceptions.\n\nArsenal manager Arteta said: \"There was a special atmosphere inside our stadium. It makes such a difference. We've been waiting a few years to get into this position and we're certainly going to enjoy it [the final].\n\n\"It's the best vitamins that we can put in our bodies because we're playing every three days. But the fact that you worked so hard to achieve those moments and to have these moments together is just magical.\n\n\"You can see the joy, the smile, the energy and everything that works at the club.\"\n\nMidfielder Declan Rice, added: \"We deserve it. The last three or four years we've been at the top of the Premier League, competing and got really close but haven't been good enough.\n\n\"That's why this season we have that extra desire and fire in our bellies to go one step further in every competition. There's a long way to go but to be in a cup final with this club is amazing.\"\n\nFor the last few years, Arteta's Arsenal reign has been a story of near-misses, both in cup competitions and in the Premier League.\n\nNow, just one game away from ending their trophy drought, are the Premier League leaders about to silence accusations of being the 'nearly men' for good?\n\nEx-Arsenal defender Matt Upson told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It has been a few years in the making and there has been a steady build-up to this point for Arsenal. Mikel Arteta has been laying the foundations, building the ethos, and togetherness of the team.\"",

    "fullText": "How do you stop Arsenal causing chaos from set-pieces?\n\nIt's the question everyone keeps asking - but few find an answer.\n\nThe Gunners are Europe's leading force in scoring from set-plays over the past couple of seasons and it has proved to be such a formidable tactic.\n\nStep forward Liam Rosenior and Chelsea, who tried an innovative way of stopping them in their Carabao Cup semi-final second-leg tie on Tuesday night - just days after former Manchester City and Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given had suggested similar on Match of the Day.\n\nWhile it wasn't able to stop the Gunners securing a 1-0 win - and 4-2 aggregate success - to book their place in the EFL Cup final, it might at least have given rivals some food for thought.\n\nJust as Arsenal were about to whip in their two corners, Chelsea sent three players sprinting from defence to attack - forcing the hosts to quickly react and send players back themselves.\n\nMonaco and Crystal Palace have also left players up against Arsenal's set-pieces before - but no team has attempted such a late attempt at forcing Mikel Arteta's men back towards their own half.\n\nPerhaps they had been listening to Given on Match of the Day on Saturday night.\n\nAfter watching Arsenal score from two set-pieces in their 4-0 thrashing of Leeds, he said: \"I wish someone would try something different.\n\n\"Take nothing away from Arsenal, but I see the same set-up every week - Arsenal players loaded at the back and causing carnage. Every set-up is the same.\n\n\"Someone can try something different to stop this brilliant form of attack. What can teams do different to create more space? If they leave three up, Arsenal have to leave at least three, maybe four players back.\n\n\"Then, in the defending box, that leaves a lot more space for the defenders and the goalkeeper. Yes, it leaves more space for the forwards as well, but all those numbers caused so much confusion.\"\n\nSince the start of last season, Arteta's men have scored 53 goals from set-pieces across all competitions - 13 more than anyone else in the Premier League.\n\nAnd Chelsea's tactic - while not enough to secure them a place in the EFL Cup final - at least stopped Arsenal from scoring from a set-play.\n\nEx-Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp was less impressed though.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: \"I like the plan, but my problem is Enzo Fernandez was left marking Gabriel and he has 10 yards to attack the ball.\n\n\"Chelsea are trying to negate there being too much traffic in the area, which Arsenal try to cause chaos with. They obviously have a plan but if Arsenal have the right delivery, Enzo Fernandez has no chance.\"",
