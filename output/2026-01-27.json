    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Rudy Gobert had 15 points and 17 rebounds as the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Golden State Warriors 108-83 on Monday night in a game missing much of its usual star power.\n\nThe Warriors were playing without starters Stephen Curry (knee) and Draymond Green (back), while Minnesota’s Anthony Edwards was a late scratch to rest an recurring right foot injury.\n\nJulius Randle led Minnesota with 18 points and Bones Hyland chipped in 17. Naz Reid and Donte DiVincenzo each scored 15 for the Timberwolves, who snapped a five-game losing streak, their longest skid since they lost five straight in December 2022.\n\nQuinten Post led Golden State with 13 points. Brandin Podziemski scored 12 points and grabbed seven rebounds, while Gui Santos had 11 points and 10 rebounds for the Warriors, who shot a season-low 23.1% (9 for 39) on 3-pointers.\n\nOne night after the Warriors snapped Minnesota's 103-game streak of scoring at least 100 points — the third-longest in NBA history — the Timberwolves overcame a cold start from the floor and 23 turnovers.\n\nMinnesota took control of the game with a 21-4 run to end the second quarter. Randle scored 10 points in the run, which gave the Timberwolves a 53-38 halftime lead.\n\nThe Timberwolves started out cold, making just two of their first 12 shots and missing seven of their first eight 3-pointers. That opened the door for a 13-0 Golden State run and an early 16-8 lead for the Warriors.\n\nHyland led a Minnesota surge with three transition layups and Reid's first 3-pointer helped the Timberwolves take a 21-20 lead after one quarter.\n\nWarriors: Visit Utah on Wednesday.\n\nTimberwolves: Face the Mavericks in Dallas on Wednesday.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

    "fullText": "Heartbreak at the Marriott Center.\n\nBYU couldn’t complete a wild comeback effort Monday night, falling 86-83 to No. 1 Arizona.\n\nThe Cougars, who suffered their first loss in Provo since February of 2025, are now 17-3 on the season and 5-2 in Big 12 play.\n\nBattle to the end. pic.twitter.com/24TxVNo40G\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 27, 2026\n\nBYU’s late comeback attempt came up short. Similar to November’s loss to UConn, the Cougars struggled for the majority of the game before capturing some magic down the stretch.\n\nBYU trailed by as many as 19 points in the second half and by 10 points in the final minute, but Kevin Young’s crew put together a 11-2 run across 40 seconds to cut the deficit to just a single point.\n\nWith 12 seconds remaining, the Cougars came out of a timeout with a chance to win the game, but Rob Wright III’s layup attempt was blocked — though some might argue he was fouled there — as the Wildcats escaped with the victory.\n\nBRAYDEN BURRIES BLOCKS THE POTENTIAL BYU GAME-WINNER 😳 \n\nARIZONA ESCAPES UNDEFEATED 🔥 pic.twitter.com/y9CJev1oej\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 27, 2026\n\nHad Wright’s layup found the hole, BYU would have earned its first-ever win over a No. 1-ranked team at the Marriott Center and ended Arizona’s unbeaten run.\n\nBut such a Hollywood ending eluded the Cougars, who now have two 1-possession losses out of their three total setbacks on the year.\n\nBrayden Burries and Jaden Bradley feasted against BYU. Entering Monday, many fans had their eyes set on the matchup between star freshmen Dybantsa and Koa Peat.\n\nInstead, Arizona’s other stud freshman and his backcourt counterpart stole the show.\n\nBurries and Bradley combined for 55 points, with 36 coming before halftime. The pair shot a collective 60.7% from the field, hit four 3-pointers, dished out seven assists and grabbed eight rebounds.\n\nBrayden Burries & Jaden Bradley were INSTRUMENTAL in Arizona's win over BYU 💯\n\nBurries: 29 PTS\nBradley: 26 PTS pic.twitter.com/OCcWLAenBy\n\n— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) January 27, 2026\n\nConversely, Dybantsa and Wright combined to shoot 9 of 40 from the field and 2 for 13 from long distance.\n\nBurries’ most important contribution of the night wasn’t on the offensive end, but rather came in the form of the game-winning block of Wright.\n\nIn all, Arizona shot 52.8% from the field and averaged 1.2 points per possession, though BYU held the Wildcats without a made field goal over the final three minutes to help orchestrate the late rally.\n\nBYU’s offense responded well in the second half — an encouraging sign considering the elite Arizona defense. In the first five minutes of play, the Cougars scored 15 points, with the night appearing as if it may turn into a shootout.\n\nBut Arizona’s Big 12-best defense quickly flipped the script, holding BYU to just 16 points in the first half’s final 15 minutes.\n\nAfter halftime, however, the Cougars adjusted well and found better results in the form of 52 points, even when Dybantsa shot just 2 of 13 from the field in the period.\n\nBYU in the first half: 33.3% shooting from the field, 21.4% shooting from 3-point range, nine turnovers, zero points from turnovers, 0.84 points per possession.\n\nBYU in the second half: 46.2% shooting from the field, 50% shooting from 3-point range, three turnovers, 13 points from turnovers. 1.41 points per possession.\n\nKennard Davis Jr. broke out of his recent slump in a major way, hitting five triples and scoring 17 total points without missing a shot in the second half to lead the Cougar comeback charge.\n\nhe's heating up 🔥\n\n📺 ESPN pic.twitter.com/yvMq3w9HDQ\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) January 27, 2026\n\nRichie Saunders added 11 points and two made threes in the latter frame as well before ultimately fouling out.\n\nThe lone offensive weakness for the Cougars in the second half was free throws — they missed six of them, which is haunting in a 3-point loss.\n\nIn conclusion: Arizona is an obvious buzzsaw. There isn’t a better team in the country.\n\nBYU has plenty to fix and improve in order to be the legitimate Final Four and national championship contender it hopes to be, because the Cougars just aren’t there right now.\n\nFor the majority of the night, the gap between the Wildcats and BYU, both execution-wise and physically, was quite large.\n\nBut the Cougars, as they have so many times already this year, refused to surrender despite the dire circumstances, nearly stealing an all-time win in the process.\n\nThat fight means something. Young and his staff can work with that to climb somewhere higher.",

Utah had a rather tall task ahead of them on Monday night, as well. Sean Durzi and his teammates took on the Tampa Bay Lightning on the road. Unfortunately, Utah came up short against Tampa, but Durzi caught the attention of fans online in a rather viral moment.\n\nDurzi got into an altercation with Lightning defenseman Declan Carlile during Monday’s loss. It appeared as if Carlile took some shots at the Mammoth star when he was hunched over. Either way, Durzi was hot after the incident. Cameras caught him screaming at Carlile in the penalty box. And it’s not too difficult to discern what was said, either.\n\nSean Durzi was GIVING IT to Declan Carlile in the penalty box 😳🤬 pic.twitter.com/hgccundpAF\n\n— Gino Hard (@GinoHard_) January 27, 2026\n\nAs mentioned, the Lightning emerged victorious at Benchmark International Arena on Monday. Goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy made 28 saves to lead his team to a shutout victory. Darren Raddysh and Anthony Cirelli were responsible for the goals.\n\nCarlile, 25, is in the midst of his first true cup of coffee in the NHL. The Michigan native has played 34 career games in the NHL, with 30 of them coming in the 2025-26 season. He has one goal and three points this season while skating a career high 14:20 a game.\n\nDurzi is a leading player for the Mammoth. He is skating nearly 21 minutes a game for the NHL’s youngest franchise. His offensive production has taken a hit due to injury over the last few seasons. Still, the 27-year-old has three goals and 15 points in 31 games this year.\n\nThe Mammoth will need to pick itself back up after a devastating loss. They hit the ice again on Tuesday night when they take on the two-time defending champion Florida Panthers.",

    "fullText": "Iowa earned a big time win over Ohio State, but it came with a bigger cost.\n\nSenior Taylor McCabe is done for the year with an ACL injury. She averaged eight points a game, started every game, and was a key leader in the locker room.\n\n“Just got to hope you prepared step by step in June for these moments. I mean, sadly, what we do injuries are a hazard of our job,” said Jan Jensen, Iowa women’s basketball’s head coach. “I feel so sick for Taylor, but I know also that’s a key cog out of our wheel, but I believe in the other kids that are going to find ways.”\n\nOne of those players is Addie Deal. She’s the Big Ten Freshman of the Week after scoring a career-high 20 points against Ohio State. Deal is confident she can help make up for McCabe’s absence.\n\n“I’m confident in my abilities. I think my teammates do a great job of just finding each other. I like the way we play, super unselfish. Just playing in this offense with these people really helps me do what I need to do,” Deal said.\n\n“Addie has been ready, and she has needed to weather so much because there are a lot of opinions, right, on when you’re going to play and how you should do. She just had to lock in and be part of the process and we watched her, we met, we worked with her. We’ve seen the weaknesses early and tried to get the more into a strength. The game is bigger, faster, stronger, and she doesn’t bat in eye,” Jensen said. “She’s just ready, she’s always ready. She’s been ready any time. Just that eagerness, and I just think I’ve always been very confident in Addie, but I also knew this game is big, fast, and strong, and our culture is our culture, and they pass the baton, and they learn and they grow. If you are open and you’re willing to just be ready, boy, the process can be really, really great.”\n\nUp next, the Hawkeyes hit the west coast. They will play USC on Thursday. Tip-off is set of 8 p.m.\n\nIowa is tied with UCLA in first place in the Big Ten. Both teams are 9-0.\n\nHawkeye Headquarters is presented by Veterans Choice Contracting LLC, your premier roofing and exterior improvement contractor.\n\nFor more Hawkeyes coverage, follow @HawkeyeHQ on Twitter and Facebook.

The players stemmed from Argentina, Brazil, the Netherlands and Spain but had been naturalized in an apparent breach of FIFA rules and played in a qualifying game for the 2027 Asian Cup that Malaysia won against Vietnam.\n\nThe Malaysian federation later took the case to sport’s highest court based in Switzerland after FIFA rejected its appeal.\n\nThe federation said in a statement Tuesday that the Court of Aribitration for Sport had approved their request for a stay of execution, allowing the seven players to continue participating in all football-related activities until a final ruling is made. The players involved are Facundo Garcés, Rodrigo Holgado, Imanol Machuca, João Figueiredo, Gabriel Palmero, Jon Irazabal and Héctor Hevel, all of whom have featured for the Harimau Malaya national team.\n\n“This means that the 12-month suspension from all football activities imposed by FIFA on the seven players has been temporarily lifted,\" the federation said in a statement. “They are now allowed to continue their careers and participate in football-related activities until CAS makes a final ruling.\"\n\nIt did not say when a final ruling is expected.\n\nMalaysian officials had claimed all seven players had a grandparent born in Malaysia, making them eligible to represent the country under FIFA rules. However, FIFA has said its own investigators found contrasting information after they were “able to obtain the relevant original documents” from the origin countries of the players.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "fullText": "Report: Rams, Seahawks coaches nearly came to blows in elevator originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp played a decisive role in ending Los Angeles’ season, delivering three of the most pivotal moments in Seattle’s 31–27 victory in the NFC championship.\n\nSeattle scored its final points on Kupp’s 13-yard touchdown reception, a play that swung momentum late in the game. Minutes later, he delivered again, hauling in a dramatic, corkscrew-style catch before lunging forward to convert a crucial first down and keep the clock moving. The Seahawks effectively iced the game when Kupp drew a defensive holding penalty downfield on former teammate Cobie Durant, extending the final drive and preventing Los Angeles from getting the ball back.\n\nThe significance of the moment was evident afterward. Kupp exited the locker room before media arrived, leaving the stadium quietly with his family, a clear indication of how personal the game had been for him.\n\nMORE: Seahawks fans will love these 11 Super Bowl predictions from ESPN\n\nThat emotion had been simmering for months. The Rams’ decision to release Kupp earlier in the season was perceived by some in Seattle as disrespectful, and tensions between the two organizations reportedly boiled over during a Week 16 matchup at the same stadium.\n\nAccording to The Athletic’s Mike Silver and multiple witnesses, a late red-zone fumble by Kupp in that game — which halted a potential Seahawks scoring drive — sparked a heated confrontation between members of both coaching staffs.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks could end up trading Sam Darnold this offseason despite Super Bowl appearance\n\nAs Rams and Seahawks coaches exited their suites at halftime and entered a shared elevator to field level, Rams assistants were discussing the fumble. One offensive coach reportedly asked which Seattle player was responsible, and when told it was Kupp, reacted with a snicker, as if the answer were expected.\n\nThat response infuriated Seahawks outside linebackers coach Chris Partridge, whose anger escalated the situation. Rams defensive pass rush coordinator Drew Wilkins shouted back, and witnesses said Partridge had to be restrained by fellow Seahawks coaches in the crowded elevator, narrowly avoiding a physical altercation.\n\nThe Seahawks will face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 60 on Feb. 8.\n\nWill Sam Darnold get an extension this offseason?

Luke Kennard’s 3-pointer from the corner capped the run and gave Atlanta a 102-92 lead.\n\nPascal Siakam led Indiana with 26 points. Aaron Nesmith scored 18 and Bennedict Mathurin returned from a thumb injury to add 16. T.J. McConnell also had 16 points.\n\nTipoff had been scheduled for Monday night but was moved to early afternoon because of the possibility of icing on the roads as the result of a winter storm gripping the South and Northeast.\n\nAtlanta’s Kristaps Porzingis (left Achilles tendinitis) and Zaccharie Risacher (left knee bone contusion) each missed his ninth straight game. The Hawks said Porzingis will be evaluated in about a week and Risacher could return for the team’s next game.\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Brandon Miller scored 30 points, and Charlotte took a 50-point lead for the second time this month on the way to rolling past Philadelphia.\n\nAll five Hornets starters finished in double figures. Kon Knueppel and Moussa Diabate scored 12, LaMelo Ball added 11 and Miles Bridges finished with 10 for Charlotte, which has won three straight games for the first time this season.\n\nIt was 28-22 after one quarter — and then Charlotte outscored Philadelphia 81-37 over the next two quarters, taking a 109-59 lead into the fourth.\n\nKelly Oubre Jr. scored 17 for Philadelphia. Jared McCain added 16 and Quentin Grimes had 14 for the 76ers, while Tyrese Maxey was held to a season-low six points on 3-for-12 shooting in 25 minutes. Maxey’s scoring average dropped a full half-point to 29.4 per game.\n\nCharlotte became the first team since Phoenix in February 2009 to lead by 50 or more points in two separate games within the same calendar month. The Hornets led Utah by 57 on their way to a 150-95 win on Jan. 10.\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell scored 45 points and Cleveland beat Orlando for their fourth straight win.\n\nMitchell was 15 of 25 from the field, including five 3-pointers, in 35 minutes. He had a season-high 26 first-half points, a great start for a player that came into the game leading the NBA in second-half scoring average at 17.6 points per game.\n\nIt was Mitchell’s 25th 30-point game this season, fourth-most in the league, and fifth with at least 40 points. He had 36 points in Saturday’s 119-105 win in Orlando.\n\nEvan Mobley had 20 points and nine rebounds as the Cavaliers equaled their longest winning streak of the season. They also had four straight victories in early November.\n\nThe run puts Cleveland a season-best eight games over .500 at 28-20. The Cavs are also 11-4 since Dec. 29.\n\nPaolo Banchero scored a season-high 37 points for Orlando, which has dropped three straight. The fourth-year forward also grabbed 10 rebounds.

Rui Hachimura added 23 points on 9-for-11 shooting.\n\nThe Lakers were swept by Chicago in their two-game series last season, including a wild 119-117 loss at the United Center on Josh Giddey’s half-court shot at the buzzer.\n\nCoby White scored 23 points for Chicago on Monday night, and Ayo Dosunmu had 20. The Bulls had won four in a row and five of six overall.\n\nHOUSTON (AP) — Alperen Sengun and Kevin Durant each scored 33 points as Houston Rockets broke open a close game in the fourth quarter and beat Memphis.\n\nThe Rockets trailed by a point at the start of the fourth before going on a 21-9 run in the first seven minutes of the period to seize control and win for the fifth time in six games.\n\nTari Eason scored 11 of his 17 points in the first half and Amen Thompson finished with 14 assists and eight points. Reed Sheppard, who earlier Monday was named to the Rising Stars game for the NBA’s All-Star weekend, finished with four points on 2-for-11 shooting, including 0 for 7 from 3-point distance.\n\nSengun had an impressing shooting night for the Rockets, going 7 for 7 from the field in the first half and 15 for 17 overall. He also contributed nine rebounds and six assists.\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. and Santi Aldama scored 17 points apiece for the Grizzlies, who lost their third straight, for the fourth time in five games and for the 10 time in 13 games.

Cam Spencer, who along with Wells and Cedric Coward, was named to the Rising Stars game, finished with 14 assists and five points.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Rudy Gobert had 15 points and 17 rebounds as Minnesota defeated Golden State in a game missing much of its usual star power.\n\nThe Warriors were playing without starters Stephen Curry (knee) and Draymond Green (back), while Minnesota’s Anthony Edwards was a late scratch to rest an recurring right foot injury.\n\nJulius Randle led Minnesota with 18 points and Bones Hyland chipped in 17. Naz Reid and Donte DiVincenzo each scored 15 for the Timberwolves, who snapped a five-game losing streak, their longest skid since they lost five straight in December 2022.\n\nQuinten Post led Golden State with 13 points.

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers went heavy on their top needs in a three-round 2026 NFL mock draft from the Draft Wire.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have a host of needs to address in the 2026 NFL draft as they continue piecing together an on-the-fly roster transition they hope helps them avoid a full-blown rebuild.\n\nA key piece of their success in that quest will be finding high-level talent via the draft. Free agency will cover some of their roster holes, but the draft is where long-term, sustainable success is found. That's why their trio of selections in a three-round projection from our friends at the Draft Wire make a ton of sense, even if they don't tackle some of the team's most immediate needs.\n\nHere's a quick look at their three picks:\n\nThe skinny: Concepcion hauled in 16 touchdowns across two seasons at North Carolina State, including a whopping 10 as a freshman. His numbers dipped some in his second season before transferring to Texas A&M where he found immediate success in the SEC. Last year he hauled in 61 receptions for 919 yards and nine touchdowns. Perhaps the most intriguing part of Concepcion's game is what he can do with the ball in his hands. He racked up 431 yards and three touchdowns on 70 carries in his college career. Concepcion also added punt return duties last season where he tallied a pair of touchdowns on 25 returns.\n\nThe skinny: McNeil-Warren would be a really interesting addition for an evolving 49ers defense. His size is evident on film and his production across four years at Toledo is strong. In 48 games he racked up 214 tackles with 11 tackles for loss, five interceptions, 17 pass breakups and nine forced fumbles. His length and athleticism would give San Francisco a new style of safety who can conceivably be a more dynamic option in the back end of their defense than either of the Ji'Ayir Brown-Malik Mustapha duo provides.\n\nThe skinny: There's a lot to like just looking at Josephs. His frame is leaner than his 6-3, 240-pound listing would suggest and he brings really good length that he uses to move blockers. His athleticism looks okay on tape, but he looks a little stiff coming off the edge which may be part of the reason he's a third-round projection this early in the draft process. Josephs spent four years at Tennessee and posted 104 tackles, 22 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks. Josephs also notched four pass breakups and six forced fumbles. More depth on the edge should be a priority in this draft for the 49ers and Josephs has a lot of desirable tools.\n\nMore 49ers: Should the 49ers re-sign DL Yetur Gross-Matos in free agency?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 2026 NFL draft: 49ers pick KC Concepcion, 2 others in 3-round mock",

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide and needs support now, call or text 988 or chat with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988lifeline.org.\n\nStanford and the family of Katie Meyer have settled a wrongful death lawsuit concerning the former soccer star's death by suicide in 2022.\n\nStanford and Meyer's family issued a joint statement Monday announcing the settlement. Meyer's family filed the lawsuit in November 2022, eight months after Meyer's death. It stated that \"the actions that led to the death of Katie Meyer began and ended with Stanford University.\"\n\nPer the lawsuit, Meyer faced disciplinary action from the university at the time of her death due to an allegation that she spilled coffee on a football player who was accused of sexually assaulting one of her teammates.\n\nThe lawsuit stated that a disciplinary letter from Stanford's office of community standards to Meyer \"contained threatening language regarding sanctions and potential 'removal from the university.'\" Per the lawsuit, Meyer received the letter on the night of her death.\n\nAt the time, Stanford spokesperson Dee Mostofi disputed the lawsuit's claim that the university was responsible for Meyer's death in statements to media.\n\nMonday's announcement did not disclose the terms of the settlement, but it did announce initiatives put in place in Meyer's honor.\n\n\"To honor Katie, Stanford will collaborate with Katie’s family to launch an initiative focused on the mental health and well-being of student-athletes at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute,\" the statement reads. \"Stanford Athletics will establish the Katie Meyer Leadership Award to be given to an exceptional Stanford student-athlete each year.\"\n\nThe statement also announced that Stanford will amend its disciplinary procedures to meet a California Law named after Meyer requiring that students in the the state's public college system have access to an independent adviser of their choice when facing a disciplinary hearing. Stanford is private and not subject to the law.\n\n\"In addition, Stanford will adopt the principles of Katie Meyer’s Law to provide support to students in its OCS disciplinary process,\" the statement reads.\n\nStanford women's soccer will retire Meyer's No. 19, per the agreement.\n\nMeyer was the starting goaltender on the 2019 Stanford team that won the NCAA championship. She came up with critical saves in a penalty shootout to secure Stanford's win over North Carolina in the title game.",

Arizona will get a chance to break the record Saturday at ASU.\n\nBut while UA led by 13 at halftime and up to 19 in the second half, the Wildcats had to hold off the Cougars in the final minute.\n\nBYU cut it to 83-77 with 40 seconds left, and Ivan Kharchenkov lost the ball in a crowd under the BYU basket when Burries was called for a flagrant foul. That gave BYU two free throws and the ball with 35.4 seconds left. BYU’s AJ Dybantsa hit both ensuing free throws to cut UA’s lead to 83-79.\n\nWhile Burries hit 1 of 2 free throws to put UA ahead 84-79, BYU’s Kennard Davis threw in an alley-oop dunk with 21 seconds left. After Bradley turned the ball over, BYU center Keba Keita made a rebound basket with 16 seconds left before UA called a timeout.\n\nAfter the timeout, BYU guard Robert Wright drove in for a layup, but UA center Motiejus Krivas blocked him, forcing the Cougars to foul Burries, who then hit two free throws with three seconds left to give UA the winning margin. The Cougars threw up a desperation buzzer bomb that widely missed.\n\nWhile the game was played within a single possession for much of the first 14 minutes, UA went on a 16-3 run toward the end of the first half to take a 44-31 halftime lead and wasn’t seriously challenged until late in the second half.\n\nUp by 13 at halftime, Arizona kept rolling through the second half despite having to face the BYU student section behind their basket. They went ahead by 19 points, 64-45, when Motiejus Krivas dunked with 10:53 left.\n\nBurries had 19 points on 6-for-10 shooting and made all six free throws he took, while Bradley had 17 points on 8-for-12 shooting.\n\nThe showdown between the top-ranked Wildcats and 13th-ranked Cougars was played mostly within one possession until Arizona went on a 10-1 run toward the end of the first half. Burries finished the run by stealing the ball from BYU’s Keba Keita and driving in for a layup and picking up a goaltending call after he released it.\n\nThe Wildcats extended the run to 16-3 when Bradley hit a pull-up jumper with 1:33 left, making seven straight field goals. They wound up shooting an even 50% from the field, though just 2 of 8 from 3-point range while holding BYU to 33.3%.\n\nWhile the Cougars outrebounded the Wildcats 21-20, Arizona scored 13 points off nine BYU turnovers — and UA only turned the ball over twice in the half, leading to no Cougar points.\n\nThe Wildcats also made BYU freshman star AJ Dybantsa work hard for his 15 first-half points. Dybantsa, who scored 43 points in BYU's 91-78 win over Utah on Saturday, shot 4 of 11 from the field and 6 of 7 from the line.\n\nBYU took a brief 20-18 lead when Mihai Boskovic hit a 3-pointer with 12:58 left in the half, but the game was tied at 24 entering the eight-minute media timeout. At that point, the Cougars were shooting 53.8% while holding UA to 38.5%, but the Wildcats scored seven points off four BYU turnovers. The Cougars did not score off UA’s first two turnovers.\n\nWhile the Wildcats moved to 21-0 overall and 8-0 in the Big 12, BYU dropped to 17-3 and 5-2.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Arizona survives scare at BYU",

The Celtics honored him with a tribute video prior to the game.\n\nWhile he only spent two seasons in Boston, Holiday left quite a mark, playing a key role in the team’s 2024 NBA championship with his tenacious defense, clutch shooting and veteran leadership.\n\nThe Celtics also welcome back Robert Williams III, who’s in his third season with Portland after spending the first five years of his career in Boston. While he didn’t win a title, he did help the Celtics reach the 2022 NBA Finals, which they lost against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nJaylen Brown on Jrue Holiday and Robert Williams III:\n\n“2 great guys, 2 great people. On the floor, but off the floor as well. Jrue has a great family.

Holiday stuffed the stat sheet with 14 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block in 24 minutes, reminding Boston fans of his two-way excellence. Meanwhile, Williams chipped in six points, two rebounds, two steals and a block in 20 minutes off the bench.\n\nDespite their efforts, they weren’t enough to help the Trail Blazers avoid defeat. Portland immediately fell behind and trailed the entire game, getting outscored by 21 points in the first quarter. The Trail Blazers managed to chip away and make the score respectable, winning the other three quarters but coming up short.\n\nPayton Pritchard led the way for the Celtics with 23 points, while Jaylen Brown had 20 to go along with eight rebounds, four assists and four steals. Derrick White had 18 points, while rookie Amari Williams stepped up with nine points and seven rebounds off the bench.\n\nBoston will welcome back another member of the 2024 squad in Kristaps Porzingis when it hosts the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday.\n\nCeltics Owner Turns Heads In Hoodie Showing Support For Drake Maye",

    "description": "The NBA released the list of participants for the Castrol Rising Stars for the 2026 All-Star Weekend. A list intended to celebrate the league’s future stars turned into disrespect for Golden State Warriors fans.",
    "fullText": "The NBA released the list of participants for the Castrol Rising Stars for the 2026 All-Star Weekend. A list intended to celebrate the league’s future stars turned into disrespect for Golden State Warriors fans. With multiple teams getting more than one selection on both rookie and sophomore teams, Dub Nation found not even one of theirs on the list.\n\nTwo years ago, Brandin Podziemski was the sole selection for the Warriors. Last year, their representation increased to two players. This year, the Warriors were among the 15 teams without representation on the sophomore and rookie lists. The Dub Nation is one of the proudest fan bases, and giving them no representation invited voices calling out the league. “Not one Warrior smh,” a fan wrote, expressing discontent with the selection.\n\nLet’s not forget, they were the most dominant team of the last decade, and produced stars like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. So, being denied entry into the list would surely warrant outrage from the fanbase. They were particularly upset with their rookie, Will Richard, getting no recognition.\n\nIn the past, several notable names haven’t made the Rising Star selection. Cam Whitmore, Tari Eason and Andrew Nembhard, who are gradually making their mark in the league, all missed the selection in 2024.\n\nIsaiah Collier, one of the best bench players in the league, was one of the missing names last year. These past snubs have also attracted similar outrage from fans on social media.\n\nThe Warriors fans’ discontent extended beyond representation. They boldly called out the league, with a fan demanding respect for one of their rookies. “Respect Will Richard.” The sentiment is certainly not baseless. The No. 56 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft has vastly outperformed expectations. He made his debut with a 13-point performance.\n\nRichard has emerged as a consistent contributor from the bench. Steve Kerr has shown trust in him, and he won over fans in his first game. He plays on both ends, and his defensive mindset has earned him Rookie of the Year praise from fans on social media. “Will Richard snubbed,” a Warriors fan bluntly called out the selection.\n\nHowever, it’s not only Warriors fans who had an issue with the lack of representation. Remember Hugo Gonzalez, Joe Mazzulla’s instinctive weapon? “Hugo Gonzalez snubbed,” a Celtics fan was clearly upset with his name not being selected. Gonzalez became an instant favorite among the Celtics fans after he made the game-tying 3-pointer to send the game against the Brooklyn Nets into double overtime.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors had one selection. Collin Murray-Boyles, the rookie from Gamecocks, had slowly gotten himself into the starter’s role in the absence of Jakob Pöltl. However, a Raptors fan took issue with one player’s absence from the sophomore roster.\n\n“Where is Jamal Shead?” one fan pointed out. Shead has emerged as the primary backup point guard for the Raptors this season. He is only behind Isaiah Collier for the most bench assists this season. Raptors fans’ issue with him being snubbed was perhaps warranted.\n\nAce Bailey was one of the biggest snubs in the selection. He is the only player from the top 9 rookie selections from 2025 who didn’t make the cut. With Utah having no players on either team, some felt he should have made it.\n\nHowever, with just 21 slots available, deserving players missing out is perhaps unavoidable. However, does it seal a player’s fate? Absolutely not.\n\nThe post Dub Nation Demands Respect After Warriors Star Is Snubbed in NBA Rising Stars Announcement appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "It feels like just yesterday we were all watching Evan Bouchard get his hat trick and listening to Mattias Ekholm sing his praises. Okay, so it was literally the last game. But it's the same difference.",
    "fullText": "It feels like just yesterday we were all watching Evan Bouchard get his hat trick and listening to Mattias Ekholm sing his praises. Okay, so it was literally the last game. But it's the same difference.\n\nNow it's Ekholm's turn. The veteran defenseman recorded a hat trick against the Anaheim Ducks, becoming just the fourth defenseman in Edmonton Oilers history to accomplish the feat. And here's the wild part: when Bouchard did it, he was only the third. Fifty-four years of Oilers hockey, and only two defensemen—Paul Coffey and Marc-Andre Bergeron—had managed it. No Oilers defenseman with a hat trick in 20 years. Then all of a sudden, two games, not even a week apart, two D-partners pull off the same statistical miracle.\n\nIf this isn't a sign that things are trending in the right direction, I don't know what is.\n\nOilers Make Depth Forward Move: Bring Up Samanski, Send Ike Howard Back to AHL Oilers recall gritty forward Josh Samanski, boosting depth with his speed and two-way play while sending down Ike Howard.\n\nConnor McDavid certainly thinks so. When asked about Ekholm's performance, he didn't hold back.\n\n\"We're not talking greatness, we're talking legendary,\" McDavid said.\n\nLegendary might be strong, but it's not wrong. Ekholm's been a steady, reliable presence on the Oilers' blue line since arriving from Nashville. He doesn't typically light up the scoresheet—he's more about shutdown defence, smart positioning, and veteran leadership. So when he scores three goals in one game? Yeah, that's legendary.\n\nOilers vs Ducks: Pre-game Stats 26-1898 | 60 PTS\n\n\"Some nights the bounces go your way. I will try to enjoy this one because it will probably be my last,\" Ekholm said with a laugh. \"I couldn't buy a goal for twenty games, then three in one.\"\n\nThat's hockey for you. Sometimes the puck just finds you. But give Ekholm credit—he's been a pillar on the Oilers blue-line for a while.\n\n\"Obviously he (Ekholm) has a bomb of a shot, and he knows how to use it,\" Leon Draisaitl said.\n\nEvan Bouchard’s Three-Goal Night: A Spotlight on a Complex Edmonton Relationship Evan Bouchard’s three-goal night against the Washington Capitals was one of those rare performances that grabs your attention—and not just because it’s unusual for a defenseman to score that much in a single game. It was a big moment for Bouchard, hitting a hat trick, racking up six points, and finishing with a plus-5 rating in his 400th NHL game. But beyond the stats, it adds a whole new layer to his complicated relationship with the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers\">Edmonton Oilers</a> and their fans—a relationship that’s a bit... well, toxic at times.\n\nHe does. Ekholm's not just getting lucky bounces—he's picking his spots, loading up, and firing. When a defenseman with his experience and shot gets opportunities, good things happen.\n\nBut here's what makes this stretch even more significant: it's not just Bouchard and Ekholm. It's the entire Oilers defence. Against the Ducks, Edmonton's blue line combined for five goals, two assists, and a plus-10. Five goals from defensemen in one game. That's absurd. That's the kind of offensive production from the back end that Stanley Cup teams get.\n\nSpencer Stastney chipped in. Darnell Nurse scored. Bouchard's been a force all season. And now Ekholm's joining the party. The Oilers' defence isn't just preventing goals — it's creating them.\n\nOilers Fans Can Get Excited About Young Talent In Edmonton Matt Savoie has scored goals in back-to-back games for the <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers#google_vignette\">Edmonton Oilers</a>. Sure, they lost both of them—badly, in the case of the Pittsburgh blowout—but a goal is a goal. They don't ask how it's done. They just count.\n\nSometimes (most of the time, let's be honest), the Oilers get a reputation for having a lousy defensive structure. And some games, it's warranted. We've watched them lose games because of defensive breakdowns, missed assignments, and untimely turnovers. But we've also seen this — two world-class performances from the top defensive pairing against two decent teams in less than a week.\n\nIt's a bit perplexing. But it also shows things are coming together on the back end. The Oilers now have two solid goalies — Tristan Jarry and Connor Ingram (sorry, Calvin Pickard; you will be missed). They've got outstanding performances from their top D-pairing. And they're getting contributions from depth defensemen who are stepping up when needed.\n\n\"If we're going to have success down the road, it's going to be from the defensive side out,\" Ryan Nugent-Hopkins said.\n\nNHL Trade Rumors: Oilers & Blue Jackets' Jenner Could Be Great Fit The Oilers could use another impactful forward and have a good potential option in Blue Jackets captain Boone Jenner.\n\nHe's absolutely right. The Oilers have always been able to score. McDavid, Draisaitl, Hyman—they'll put up goals. But Cups aren't won on offence alone. You need goaltending. You need defensemen who can move the puck, shut down opposing forwards, and contribute offensively when opportunities arise.\n\nRight now, the Oilers are getting all of that. Bouchard and Ekholm are playing on another level. The depth defensemen are contributing. The goaltending's been solid. And the structure—when they commit to it—is there.\n\nTwo hat tricks from defensemen in a week. That's not normal. That's not something you can count on happening again. But it's a reflection of how dangerous this team can be when everything works. When the defence is active, when they're shooting, when they're confident—this team becomes nearly impossible to stop.\n\nInjury Update: Will Mattias Ekholm Make It to The Olympics After All? Sweden's Olympic defense faces uncertainty, potentially opening a door for Mattias Ekholm to join the roster after initially being overlooked.\n\nEkholm might never score another hat trick in his career. He's probably right about that. But for one night against Anaheim, he was legendary. And the Oilers' defence? It's starting to look like it might actually be good enough to win something.\n\nKeep your eye on the blue line. It might just take the Oilers to that next level.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more. Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "title": "Mike Macdonald Announces John Harbaugh Decision After Confirming Seahawks’ Schedule",
    "description": "While the Seattle Seahawks will be playing their fourth Super Bowl on February 8 against the New England Patriots, the responsibility to prepare the team for the big game will be upon head coach Mike Macdonald. However, the 38-year-old is only in his second season as a head coach.",
    "fullText": "While the Seattle Seahawks will be playing their fourth Super Bowl on February 8 against the New England Patriots, the responsibility to prepare the team for the big game will be upon head coach Mike Macdonald. However, the 38-year-old is only in his second season as a head coach. So it’s fair to wonder: where will Macdonald turn for advice when preparing for a Super Bowl?\n\nNot surprisingly, Mike Macdonald recently announced that he will turn to John Harbaugh, his former Baltimore Ravens mentor, for consultation regarding the high-stakes game.\n\n“I haven’t talked to John [Harbaugh] yet, but at some point probably will [consult him],” Mike Macdonald said while addressing the media on January 26.\n\nMike Macdonald spent eight seasons working under John Harbaugh in Baltimore. It was in 2014 that Macdonald started working as an intern under Harbaugh.\n\nThen, in 2022 and 2023, he was promoted to work as the Ravens’ defensive coordinator. So, obviously, the majority of what Macdonald knows about coaching in the NFL comes from the knowledge he gained from Harbaugh.\n\nInterestingly, Mike Macdonald joined the Ravens after their only Super Bowl appearance under Harbaugh back in 2012. That year, Harbaugh led Baltimore to a dramatic 34-31 win over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. Over 18 seasons, he guided the Ravens to 12 playoff appearances and six AFC North title wins.\n\nBut after another missed playoff run this past season, Baltimore decided it was time for a change with Lamar Jackson still in place as the franchise quarterback. So, earlier this month, the Ravens fired Harbaugh after wrapping up an 8-9 season. But Harbaugh didn’t stay hanging for long.\n\nJust days after leaving Baltimore, John Harbaugh landed a new head coaching job with the New York Giants. At 63, his coaching experience and his 180-113 regular-season record with Baltimore clearly played a major role in the Giants giving him a five-year deal. Harbaugh’s experience could also help Mike Macdonald significantly, since he will become the third-youngest HC in Super Bowl history, after Mike Tomlin and Sean McVay.\n\nFor now, Seattle’s HC revealed that he has barely dipped his toes into game-planning for the Super Bowl matchup. Macdonald mentioned that he’s watched only about five plays of Patriots tape so far. But he also made it clear that he doesn’t want to overcomplicate things or change what’s been working for Seattle.\n\n“I think one of the differences between how we’ve run our program this year and the last few years is we don’t have a ‘Hey, this is the Super Bowl handbook,’” Mike Macdonald said. “This is how you handle all the things.’ Our mentality is, ‘Hey, look, we’re all in this together going into this experience, and this is how we want to take it day by day and kind of get through all these hurdles, so to speak.’ Those guys will be right along there for the ride and leading the charge.”\n\nMacdonald further stressed that the process stays the same in Seattle, win or lose. But even if the mindset doesn’t change, the Seahawks’ schedule certainly does.\n\nAfter beating the Rams, the Seahawks now have two weeks to prepare before facing the Patriots in Santa Clara. When a reporter asked Mike Macdonald what the team’s schedule would look like after the NFC Championship win, his answer revealed that the Seahawks will first take a breath before ramping things up again.\n\n“The guys are going to be off,” Mike Macdonald said. “Well, they are in today for some logistic stuff. We just kind of put last night’s game to bed. Got food trucks out there, which is exciting. Off for a couple of days, and then we’ll start like a normal cadence on Thursday. I believe we are travelling on Sunday.”\n\nThat short break could be crucial, especially when you look at Seattle’s injury situation. The biggest question mark remains over Seattle’s quarterback, Sam Darnold, who dealt with an oblique injury leading up to the NFC title game. Even though there won’t be any official injury reports from the Seahawks until next week, Mike Macdonald shared an update on Darnold’s injury coming off Sunday night’s win.\n\n“I don’t know what the trajectory is, how many reps he’s [Darnold] going to need, or how much he’s going to want to take,” Macdonald said. “I don’t know that yet.”\n\nSam Darnold, of course, looked anything but limited during the NFC title clash. He threw for 346 yards and 3 touchdowns in a back-and-forth win over the Rams. But it remains uncertain whether Darnold will be able to practice fully this week or next week in Santa Clara. For now, the Seahawks are trying to balance rest, recovery, and preparation in the days leading up to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThe post Mike Macdonald Announces John Harbaugh Decision After Confirming Seahawks’ Schedule appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Hapoel Tel Aviv slipped by Hapoel Beersheba 112-108 in overtime to notch the tight win at Yad Eliyahu and improve its Israeli league record to 14-1 and remain in first place.\n\nHapoel Tel Aviv slipped by Hapoel Beersheba 112-108 in overtime to notch the tight win at Yad Eliyahu and improve its Israeli league record to 14-1 and remain in first place.\n\nThe Southern Reds played the hosts tight from the get-go as CJ Elleby, Cody Demps, and Brandon Angel all contributed to a 51-49 halftime lead for the visitors. Antonio Blakeney, Johnathan Motley, along with Tomer Ginat and Bar Timor, picked up the pace in the second half to open up a late double-digit lead.\n\nHowever, Rami Hadar’s squad ripped off a 15-0 run as Damian Dunn and Yoav Vitlem led the charge while Angel scored the tying basket to send the game into the extra session. In overtime, Beersheba held its own, but Ginat grabbed an offensive board and scored to put Dimitrios Itoudis’s side in front for good as it took the victory.\n\nBlakeney scored 27 points for Tel Aviv, Motley added 23 points, and Ginat put in 19 points in the win. Elleby and Vitlem each scored 22 points for Beersheba, and Demps and Dunn each added 20 points in the loss.\n\nTel Aviv coachItoudis shared his thoughts on the tough win.\n\n“Congratulations to the team. It seems we have some kind of issue where we want to give up a lead and make the game interesting. We have to take these wins. The other team was very good, and we weren’t there defensively, but we’re the same team that came back in the second half and showed up well.”\n\nBeersheba bench boss Hadar spoke about his team’s showing.\n\n“I think we played very well, especially on the offensive side. Our ability to come back from a big deficit and force overtime makes me very happy. Our breaking point is high. On the other hand, we lost the game after we were right there; we had the game in our hands, but that’s how things go, and we move on.”\n\nIn other action, Maccabi Tel Aviv defeated Maccabi Ramat Gan 98-91 by the skin of its teeth and needed to mount a pair of double-digit comebacks to take the win on the road at the Zisman Arena.\n\nShmulik Brenner’s Ramat Gan squad grabbed a 50-43 advantage at halftime on the strength of a superb first half by Ronaldo Segu and Adam Ariel, but Oded Katash’s Tel Aviv charges – led by Tamir Blatt, TJ Leaf, and a charged-up Oshae Brissett – turned the tables in the second half to snatch the win.\n\nBlatt scored 23 points, Leaf put in 20 points, and Brissett scored 17 points in the victory for the yellow-and-blue, while Ariel scored 23 points and Segu added 22 points for Ramat Fan in the loss.\n\nNext up for Maccabi Tel Aviv is a visit to Valencia in Euroleague action on Thursday.\n\nKatash was reflective after the game.\n\n“In the first half, we weren’t there; we didn’t disrupt them. We were all over the place offensively, but I liked our response in the second half. We protected the ball better, defended better, and were more aggressive. We’re coming off a week that wasn’t easy in terms of scheduling, but we got through this game. There are no easy games in the league. We need to remember this game and take things from it.”\n\nBlatt, the game’s MVP, also shared his thoughts.\n\n“I’m happy that I’m playing well and helping the team win. Ramat Gan is a very well-coached team that plays in a specific system, and that made things difficult for us. In the second half, we got more stops, and that’s what brought the win.”\n\nMeanwhile, Hapoel Jerusalem got by Hapoel Galil Elyon 81-76 in a game that was neck-and-neck for the entire 40 minutes at Kfar Blum.\n\nYonatan Alon’s Jerusalem team jumped out to a quick 15-3 lead thanks to Jared Harper’s sharpshooting, but Raz Adam helped Idan Avshalom’s squad to a 43-42 advantage at halftime.\n\nHowever, Jerusalem with Khadeen Carrington, Justin Smith, and Yovel Zoosman was able to outscore Cyril Langevine, DJ Kennedy, and Toney Douglas to take the win.\n\nHarper scored 17 points while Smith and Carrington each scored 12 points in the win, as Langevine led Galil Elyon with 16 points, Adam added 15 points, and Kennedy put in 11 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in the loss.\n\nJerusalem coach Alon commented after the contest.\n\n“We’ll prepare for our upcoming games in full seriousness, the same way we prepare for every game, and we hope to get the job done, just like we have so far in the big games.”\n\nAvshalom also shared his thoughts.\n\n“Kennedy’s layup came up short, while battling alone isn’t enough, we need to collect wins.”\n\nAlso, Hapoel Holon crushed Kiryat Ata 94-63 as Adama Sonogo starred in his debut with the Purples, a game that saw Yoav Shamir’s squad take an early lead and never look back to record the win.\n\nSonogo scored 20 points, Netanel Artzi added 18 points, and Derrick Walton put in 17 points in the win, while Jemaya Neal scored 14 points and Ilay Dolinski put in 12 points in the loss.\n\nFinally, Elitzur Netanya defeated Ness Ziona 95-91 as Amit Gershon led the way, as six players scored in double digits to help the diamond city squad continue its fine play under new head coach Eli Raby.\n\nGershon scored 20 points, Or Cornelius scored 14 points, and Diante Baldwin added 13 points in his Netanya debut, while Bryce Brown scored 24 points and Desi Rodriguez put in 15 points for Ness Ziona in the defeat.",

    "fullText": "As the 2026 season approaches, several NFL teams remain in search of the right leader to guide their next chapter. These openings reflect franchises at different crossroads, whether rebuilding, retooling, or trying to push a talented roster over the top. The decisions made in the coming weeks will shape not only next season, but the long-term direction of each organization.\n\nArizona’s opening represents a chance to fully reset the organization’s direction. The roster has young talent but lacks consistency and identity, making this a pivotal hire. The Cardinals must decide whether to prioritize offensive innovation or cultural rebuilding. Their next coach will likely be tasked with long-term development rather than immediate contention.\n\nThe Bills’ vacancy is one of the most attractive jobs on the market due to a strong core and established expectations. However, the pressure to win immediately will narrow the candidate pool. Buffalo needs a leader who can manage high expectations while refining late-game execution. The next coach will be judged quickly by postseason results.\n\nCleveland’s search reflects ongoing instability at the top despite roster talent. The Browns need a coach who can unify the locker room and bring clarity to both sides of the ball. Consistency and leadership will matter as much as schematic prowess. This hire could define the franchise’s direction for years.\n\nThe Raiders continue searching for a coach who can stabilize a franchise defined by constant change. Las Vegas needs a strong cultural leader capable of commanding respect in a demanding market. Identity, discipline, and accountability are key priorities. The next hire must balance star power with structure.\n\nFor teams still searching, patience and clarity will be just as important as splash or star power. The right hire can stabilize a franchise and establish an identity, while the wrong one can set progress back years. How these teams finish the coaching carousel may ultimately define the balance of the league heading into 2026.\n\nThe post NFL: Teams still looking for new head coaches appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "On a night that saw CM Punk wrestle AJ Styles (to a DQ) here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 1/26/26 episode of \"WWE Raw!\"",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s weekly review of \"WWE Raw,\" the show where we might have had a new World Heavyweight Champion if not for that meddling Irishman! Yes, Finn Balor interrupted a world title match between CM Punk and the possibly-retiring-soon AJ Styles this week, and boy do we ever have thoughts about it! In fact, fully half our column is devoted to that match and its aftermath, simply because the WINC staff had such strong feelings — but don't think we're neglecting the rest of the card! We might not be talking about Alpha Academy's big win, but we will certainly discuss the entire Vision making it into the rapidly-filling Royal Rumble match, as well as the follow-up from Natalya's heel turn and the six-woman tag team bout that served as the show's in-ring opener.\n\nIf you missed Monday's festivities in Toronto, feel free to catch up via our \"Raw\" results page. If you want to know what the WINC crew thought of the show, this is the place to be. Here are three things we hated and three things we loved about the 1/26/26 episode of \"WWE Raw!\"\n\nLast week, Nattie unceremoniously turned heel when she put Becky Lynch's foot on the rope to screw Maxxine Dupri. Why Nattie, why? We found out *checks notes* in a video that aired during \"Raw.\"\n\nIn the video, Nattie says Maxxine failed her. \"You think because you rolled with a legend, you could roll like a legend?\" She says that'll never happen because she's \"a whole new me.\" The former \"Queen of Harts\" declared that when she's done with Maxxine, she's coming for everything as it cuts to a clip of Becky Lynch holding the Women's IC title. The video ends with \"because Natalya elevates, Nattie dominates.\" That's a really great line and I love that we've been getting the \"Low Key Legend\" on WWE programming, which is what makes this even more frustrating.\n\nThe heel turn was done hastily. If you want to sell people on the heel turn, why would you have the follow up be in a video? That should have been an in-ring segment, especially because they were in her home country of Canada. Imagine the heat she could've gotten from her fellow Canadians if she said all of this in the ring. She should have said it directly to Dupri and the fans could've deduced that Nattie was coming from the IC title since that was the title on the line during the match that she interfered in. This version of Nattie is the most compelling she's been in a while and it would better be served in the ring now that we've had all the vignettes of her training Dupri. At the very least, it could've been a backstage segment with Jackie Redmond questioning her actions.\n\nAt Saturday Night's Main Event this past weekend, Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY defended their women's tag titles against Liv Morgan and Roxanne Perez. It was a very good match that some might say was marred by interference from Raquel Rodriguez and Stephanie Vaquer. So naturally, on \"Raw,\" all three female members of The Judgment Day teamed up against Ripley, SKY, and Vaquer in a six-woman tag match.\n\nWhile the SNME match had the advantage of having stakes, the \"Raw\" match was overall better, essentially being run as the exact same thing but without the interference and with Vaquer (always a delight in the ring) and Rodriguez, who is thriving in her current role as TJD's heavy hitter. Sure, Perez took the fall this time instead of Morgan, but the finish was essentially the same beyond that, and it was an overwhelmingly fun match with a clean ending on a show that didn't have a ton of that. Two really good matches in three days? Not sure how much more we could reasonably ask for from these six.\n\nWell, it looks like WWE is indeed not planning on running any kind of match between Bron Breakker and \"Raw\" General Manager Adam Pearce anytime soon.\n\nGiven that things between Breakker and Pearce have become incredibly heated on multiple occasions, I expected their face-to-face tonight to be much more tense than it actually ended up being. All that really happened during this several minute segment was Adam Pearce briefly apologizing to Breakker, announcing The Vision all had spots in the 2026 Men's Royal Rumble, and setting up the subsequent match between Austin Theory and Rey Mysterio. It felt like it was a major let down when all was said and done, especially considering that it was one of the bigger segments on tonight's show amidst the few segments that was properly advertised ahead of tonight's show. I know that we're talking about WWE and I've learned to not get my hopes up after watching this company week in and week out, but I still expected more from this segment and was vastly disappointed by what came out of it.\n\nWell, this weekend is sure being built as though it's going to be AJ Styles' last hoorah in WWE. Monday's show saw him come out to address the crowd before being interrupted by World Heavyweight Champion and fellow indie darling-turned-WWE legend CM Punk.\n\nThe two then did essentially an improv skit, teasing the crowd with the idea of them having their first and potentially only ever singles match in the near future, only to then bemoan the fact that they may not be able to if Gunther wins; with a big old grin on his face Styles feigned offense at the idea he couldn't beat Gunther, saying he could beat Punk and thus after a lot of self-indulgent, \"Yeah we know this is the match you want,\" back and forth it was finally announced they would face each other in the main event.\n\nThe main event itself was unfortunately a shell of what it would have been 20 or even 10 years ago. But that's by no means intended to say it was bad. It was what you would expect from two of the greatest wrestlers in the world throughout the 2000-10s in 2026. I was born in 2000 and grew up with Styles and Punk as two of my favorite wrestlers, and while watching Styles in TNA and Punk in WWE there had always been that question over if they would ever step in the ring together.\n\nThat sentimentality helped to bridge any form of gap in terms of the match quality. This was a moment both in each man's careers but for me as a wrestling fan. Even if it was a moment that very could and maybe should, in another life, have been on the marquee for WrestleMania.\n\nPunk and Styles exchanged their greatest hits and the story was there, once again teasing the audience with the idea that Styles could win his third World title just days before a career threatening match. There was a really close near-fall on a Styles Clash, Punk had Styles almost counted out with a GTS on the floor, and everything was building to a great climax. That was until...\n\n...Finn Balor showed up after teasing a babyface turn to cause a disqualification in the main event between Styles and Punk. And that's just annoying, because nothing good can ever not come with a bait-and-switch.\n\nBalor was Punk's last challenger when \"Raw\" hit Northern Ireland, wrestling what was, for all intents and purposes, a pretty babyface performance. Go figure, since it was an Irish crowd and he is an Irish star. It's not as though we haven't seen the home hero play up to the crowd for one night only, but then during this week's show he walked up all respectful and potentially turning a new leaf as he thanked Punk for the night and the opportunity. Punk then said he should consider leaving the Judgment Day, because Punk clearly watches the product as well, and Balor looked to be genuinely considering it. Progress.\n\nAnother backstage segment rolled around, and Balor was looking to continue turning that leaf with an entry into the Royal Rumble. Adam Pearce said that the Rumble was full, which is hilariously odd considering the very nature of the Rumble. That sent Balor into perhaps the most reasonable crash out in WWE history. And then Liv Morgan hit Balor with the \"I heard what Punk said\" and then that appeared to be all she wrote. But no, Balor turned up during the main event to attack Punk while he had Styles on his shoulders. One thing. Can we not just have one stinking thing? I get that Balor should continue his world title program, and I am a massive fan of Balor's work in the ring, but it didn't have to come at the detriment of yet another main event and the only bit of progress WWE had made in Balor's arc of late.\n\nBalor could very well have done the attack on Punk after the match had concluded to close the show. To the presumed counter-argument that Styles couldn't lose before facing Gunther, there are a few prepared responses: Styles losing would add an added sense of jeopardy to the match that has his career on the line; Styles losing wouldn't exactly make a difference to the significance of this weekend; Styles losing to Punk is not a major loss even if he is planned to beat Gunther, Punk is World Champion presumably heading into WrestleMania; Styles did lose, he lost by disqualification.\n\nIt's just annoying to be given something in a way that says, \"Hey, we're throwing this dream match out on TV because we don't know if we will have another chance,\" and it wind up with, \"Sike, you'll get what you're given and what you're given is the exact same every week.\"\n\nI can't say I expected a big main event push, especially a pretty interesting one, for Finn Balor in the year 2026, but I also can't say I'm disappointed by it, as a fan of his. I didn't think any more would come of Balor and CM Punk's story in the ring after Balor lost to the World Heavyweight Champion in his home country of Ireland a few weeks ago, and I'm glad to be wrong. Balor's story tonight was kind of a rollercoaster, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nIt started off with babyface turn tease in a backstage segment with Punk, when Balor thanked him for what he did at the end of their match last week, when Punk raised his hand to celebrate in front of the Irish crowd. Punk then told Balor if he wanted to become champion, he needed to leave Judgment Day. The faction's breakup has been an ongoing story for what feels like forever now on \"Raw,\" I thought we actually might be headed toward it this time. Liv Morgan wasn't a huge fan of that, as we saw in another backstage segment, which did further the power struggle storyline between the two of them, which I thought was good no matter what Balor decided to do.\n\nBalor then went to do the right thing and ask \"Raw\" General Manager Adam Pearce if he could enter the Royal Rumble, doing the honorable thing to try and get another title match, and Pearce told him the Rumble match was full. That's when I started to think Balor wasn't actually turning face like they'd be teasing, because now, he has to whip some a**, perhaps maybe even pulling out The Demon, to get into the match. Or, he could just go out there and attack Punk during his main event match with AJ Styles, like we saw at the end of the night tonight. If \"Raw\" was going to end in yet another DQ, at least it was Balor doing something rather than The Vision.\n\nIf we're not just speed running Styles' retirement tour, I think he gets a match against Balor. WWE would never acknowledge the meeting of the former Bullet Club leaders, but fans would sure know. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, because I do think Styles retires at the Royal Rumble, but a Styles vs. Balor short storyline and number one contender's match would be really good. The Royal Rumble is certainly shaping up to be an interesting PLE for many different reasons, and I'm excited to see what happens for Balor moving forward.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

But when you’re a receiver, it’s different than when you’re a quarterback. And coverage can dictate different things, but Jeremiah just keeps playing over and over again, has an unbelievable attitude.”\n\nDay said the maturity in Smith is what truly stands out.\n\n\"All of these guys are very prideful, all of them want the ball, all of them have expectations,” Day said. “And to see the unselfishness each week of a bunch of guys that just want to win, like that’s winning football in a day and age that there’s a lot that’s going on.”\n\nEntering the off-season, that same workhorse-type mindset will have to carry over to give the Buckeyes the best chance of success offensively.\n\nMORE: Kenneth Walker III, Jaxon Smith-Njigba lead list of Big Ten stars in Super Bowl 60\n\nIf so, Smith may just have one more good year left in him.\n\nIndiana's Curt Cignetti sent cautious repeat national championship warning from Joel Klatt\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba joins elite club with absurd record in Seahawks-Rams NFC Championship\n\nCollege football analyst rips those in denial of Curt Cignetti's, Indiana's success\n\nCollege football pundit shares shocking Ohio State football ranking amid 2026 off-season",

    "fullText": "Alexander Zverev allegations, explained: Why tennis star reached 'out-of-court settlement' in 2024 domestic violence trial originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlexander Zverev has just started his Australian Open 2026 campaign.\n\nWhile the world No. 3's strong on-court performances have garnered plenty of attention in the past years, there has also been a heavy focus on Zverev's trial over domestic abuse allegations.\n\nBefore the 2024 Australian Open, a district court in Germany announced that the German star would face a public trial to answer accusations of physically abusing his former partner.\n\nZverev has continued to deny the allegations, with a settlement reached in June last year.\n\nMORE: Who is the world No.1 in men's tennis?\n\nZverev settled his domestic violence case with ex-girlfriend Brenda Patea in June 2024, as reported by DW News' Jonathan Crane.\n\nThe \"out-of-court settlement\" was revealed the morning of his semi-final at Roland-Garros.\n\nThe tennis star agreed to pay fines of €150,000 to the state and €50,000 to charity.\n\nZverev was accused of strangling his ex-girlfriend in a Berlin apartment.\n\nThere has been no admission of guilt by the German player.\n\nIn October 2020, Zverev was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-girlfriend, Olga Sharypova. He denied those claims on Instagram, saying that her \"unfounded allegations\" were \"simply not true\".\n\nSharypova subsequently conducted two interviews with journalist Ben Rothenberg, which were published in November 2020 and August 2021, respectively.\n\nThe alleged assaults included Zverev punching her in the face, covering her face with a pillow until she struggled to breathe and pushing her against a wall.\n\nIn October 2021, the ATP — male tennis' governing body — announced an investigation into those allegations. Zverev again denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThat ATP investigation took place over 15 months before it was closed in January 2023. Zverev was not sanctioned, with the body citing insufficient evidence.\n\nZverev subsequently issued a statement maintaining his innocence and welcoming the ATP's findings.\n\nFresh allegations against Zverev of domestic violence against a different ex-partner emerged in 2023, with the 26-year-old ordered by a Berlin court in November to pay a €450,000 fine.\n\nFormer partner Brenda Patea alleged in an interview with a German newspaper that she was pushed into a wall and choked in May 2020.\n\nZverev denied those charges and lodged an objection against the penalty order, which under German law means a public trial must take place.\n\nIn a statement released when the penalty order was issued, Zverev's lawyers said the evidence had been dismissed as \"incomprehensible and contradictory\" by a medical report.\n\nZverev's hearing began on May 31, 2024, which overlapped with the French Open that year.\n\nThe tournament started on May 26 and ran until June 9.\n\nHowever, he was not required to appear at the trial in person.\n\nThis is because the ATP Tour rulebook does not feature a policy for player punishments for domestic violence charges.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, the rulebook allows for a provisional suspension if a player is charged with a civil or criminal offense \"contrary to the integrity of the Game of Tennis\", although that policy was not been implemented.\n\nThe hearing was expected to continue into July and potentially clash with Wimbledon, but with the case settled, the trial ended early.\n\nZverev was announced as a new member of the ATP's Player Advisory Council at the start of 2024. He was elected by his peers on the tour, alongside nine other members.\n\nThe main responsibility of the council is to make recommendations to tour management and the ATP board.\n\nHis position on the council while he faces domestic violence allegations was questioned by journalists at last year's Australian Open.\n\n\"Why would it not be?\" Zverev said when asked if it was appropriate to be on the Player Advisory Council.\n\n\"Nobody has said anything to me. I don't have a reason not to believe that.\"",

    "fullText": "EDMONTON, Alberta – It took just under four minutes in the second period for the Anaheim Ducks’ seven-game win streak to unravel on Monday.\n\nEdmonton got four consecutive goals from defensemen in 3:49 to tie, go ahead of and pull away from the Ducks for a deficit even a Mikael Granlund hat trick of power play goals could not undo in a 7-4 loss at Rogers Place.\n\nAnaheim had tied a season-long seven-game win streak coming out of a nine-game losing skid, but the Ducks couldn’t get it all together on the back end of a road back-to-back and their third road game in four nights. Anaheim gets two nights off before closing the five-game road trip in Vancouver on Thursday.\n\nGranlund scored power play goals in the first, second and third period to bring Anaheim back within one goal with just over six minutes remaining, but the Oilers hit a pair of empty netters to hold off the Ducks’ charge.\n\nAlex Killorn also scored in the second period off a strong Ryan Poehling forecheck, and Ville Husso stopped 25 of 30 shots.\n\nAnaheim (28-22-3, 59 points) could not leapfrog Edmonton (27-19-8, 62) for second place in the Pacific Division. The Ducks still hold a four-point lead over wild-card San Jose (26-21-3, 55 points), Los Angeles (21-16-13, 55 points) and Seattle (23-19-9, 55 points).\n\nSan Jose and Los Angeles hold three games in hand on the Ducks, with Seattle only playing two games fewer.\n\nDucks back within one with a hat trick of power play goals for Mikael Granlund. Each one a solo wrister. Hat tricks on back-to-back nights for Anaheim.\n\n5-4 in Edmonton, six minutes to go. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/bi15QB6HDi\n\n— Zach Cavanagh (@ZachCav) January 27, 2026\n\nIt was a momentous night in the triple-goal column on both sides of the ice on Monday.\n\nFor the Ducks, Finnish Olympian Mikael Granlund was just the third player in franchise history to notch three power play goals in a single game, matching fellow Finn Temmu Selanne in 2008 and Paul Kariya in 2001. It was Anaheim's first three-goal game on the power play of the season and first multi-goal power play game since Jan. 6. The Ducks are 5-for-10 on the power play in the last four games after going 0-for-12 in the previous five games.\n\nPaired with Beckett Sennecke’s own history hat trick on Sunday in Calgary, Granlund’s hat trick marked just the second time in Ducks history with hat tricks in consecutive games–Corey Perry and Saku Koivu in 2012–and the first time in franchise history it happened on consecutive days.\n\nOn the Oilers side, Mattias Ekholm notched a hat trick with the second empty-netter of the game, which added together with Evan Bouchard’s hat trick in the Oilers last game made for the first time in Edmonton’s history that defensemen recorded hat tricks in consecutive games.\n\nGranlund and Eklund’s hat tricks were the third pair of dueling hat tricks in the NHL this season and the 26th and 27th hat tricks in the league in January, matching the NHL record for a single month.\n\nOilers have found a leak in the Ducks. Turnover at the offensive blue line, and it's another easy one through Husso. Rough few minutes to say the least for Anaheim.\n\n5-2 in Edmonton. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/SfNmGM0Q3b\n\n— Zach Cavanagh (@ZachCav) January 27, 2026\n\nIt was a combination of neutral zone turnovers, aggressive Oilers blue-liners and some leaks in Ville Husso–all things that were absent from the Ducks’ turnaround win streak–that swung the game toward Edmonton in the second period.\n\nWith Anaheim leading 2-1, Spencer Stastney sent a shot that was going wide right of the Ducks crease off of Olen Zellweger’s skate and into the net to tie the game. It was an unfortunate bounce that opened up the floodgates.\n\nLess than two minutes later, Edmonton rushed out of their zone with Ekholm charging up the center lane for an odd-numbered attack. Poehling couldn’t stop up the play on the boards, and in behind, a quick passing sequence from Connor McDavid to Zach Hyman found the streaking Ekholm for the deflection. Radko Gudas couldn’t tie up Ekholm, and the play happened so quick it seemingly surprised Husso, as this one squeaked through, 3-2.\n\nJust over a minute later, Poehling lost his footing at the offensive blue line before and outlet pass reached him, and Darnell Nurse raced in to take the puck against the flow of traffic. Nurse snuck it short side on Husso from the left wing, 4-2.\n\nOnly 51 seconds later, Sennecke held up just inside the offensive blue line, and his back hand pass couldn’t find Jansen Harkins entering the zone. Once again, Ekholm leapt forward and broke in off a Matt Savoie pass to beat Husso far side from the left wing, 5-2.\n\nAnaheim charged back with Granlund’s next two power play goals, but the deficit was too large to fully overcome.\n\nAnd Edmonton doubles the lead. Ryan Poehling trips, and the Oilers jump on it the other way. Short side Husso gives up a rough one from Nurse.\n\n4-2. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/S7XNPYJExx\n\n— Zach Cavanagh (@ZachCav) January 27, 2026\n\nDespite the nearly four-minute meltdown, Anaheim held the analytic edge in the game, per Natural Stat Trick. At five-on-five, the Ducks earned 62.75% of the expected goals and 59.09% of the high-danger chances.\n\nHusso played his first game since Jan. 17 after a hot run by Lukas Dostal, who was named the NHL’s third star of the week (4-0-0, 2.18 goals against average, .925 save percentage last week). Husso allowed 2.19 goals above expected on Monday.\n\nAnaheim gave up its 13th and 14th empty net goals of the season with an early pull of Husso for the extra attacker. The Ducks are tied with Buffalo for fifth-most empty net goals allowed in the league. The Rangers have allowed a league-high 18 with Florida at 16 and Nashville and Vancouver at 15.\n\nRyan Strome played just 4:42 of ice time on Monday, and assuming there was no injury, it would be the lowest ice time for any game this season for a Duck without injury or ejection. Strome took a high sticking penalty late in the first period and did not take a shift until 10 minutes into the second period. He took one more shift five minutes later but did not see the ice in the third period.\n\nBetween injuries and healthy scratches, it has been a tough season for the veteran.",

    "fullText": "The hot stove is officially burning. While pitchers and catchers don’t report until mid-February, the 2026 offseason has already delivered a flurry of massive contracts, trades, and extensions. From record-breaking re-signings to blockbuster moves for new faces, teams are opening their checkbooks to secure the talent needed for a World Series run. Here are the top 10 richest deals signed so far this winter, ranked by total contract value.\n\nDeal: 2 years, $40 million\nThe Mets continue to spend aggressively, bolstering their infield with Polanco. At $20 million per year, it’s a significant commitment for a veteran bat who brings switch-hitting power and versatility. This move signals New York’s intent to add reliable offensive depth to its star-studded lineup.\n\nDeal: 3 years, $45 million\nPhiladelphia locks up its field general, ensuring continuity behind the plate. While the annual value is lower than his previous market-setting deal, this contract keeps one of the game’s best all-around catchers in red pinstripes. It’s a move about stability and leadership for a team with championship aspirations.\n\nDeal: 3 years, $45 million\nThe Braves invest heavily in their bullpen, signing Suarez to lock down the late innings. After saving 40 games with a sub-3.00 ERA, he commands a premium price for a reliever. This deal reflects the modern emphasis on elite bullpen arms as essential postseason weapons.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $57.5 million (Extension)\nKansas City bets on its young core, extending its third baseman through his prime years. Garcia’s breakout 2025 season, featuring 16 homers and 23 steals, secured his financial future and solidified his status as a cornerstone player. It’s a classic small-market move to buy out arbitration years and secure cost certainty.\n\nDeal: 4 years, $60 million\nThe Blue Jays tap into the international market, bringing Japanese slugger Okamoto to North America. With a track record of elite power in the NPB, including a record-breaking 56-homer season, he offers high-upside offensive potential. This signing is a calculated risk to inject power into the middle of Toronto’s order.\n\nDeal: 3 years, $126 million\nIn a stunning splash, the Mets land the All-Star shortstop on a massive short-term deal. The high AAV ($42 million) allows Bichette to re-enter the market while giving New York an elite bat in his prime. It’s a “win-now” move that reshapes their infield and adds another premium playmaker to the mix.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $130 million\nBoston addresses its most significant need, starting pitching, by poaching a reliable arm from a rival. Suarez brings playoff experience and a lefty profile that should play well at Fenway Park. This contract signifies that the Red Sox are done sitting on the sidelines and are ready to spend for rotation stability.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $150 million (Extension)\nThe Phillies ensure their designated slugger isn’t going anywhere. Schwarber’s ability to hit homers in bunches and work walks makes him a unique offensive force. This deal keeps the heart of Philadelphia’s order intact, prioritizing power and clubhouse leadership for the foreseeable future.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $155 million\nIn perhaps the offseason’s biggest shocker, the Orioles swipe the “Polar Bear” from their division rivals. Alonso’s prodigious power (38 homers, 126 RBIs) immediately transforms Baltimore’s lineup into a juggernaut. It’s a statement signing that declares the Orioles are ready to dominate the AL East for years to come.\n\nDeal: 5 years, $162.5 million (Extension)\nThe Yankees retain their star outfielder with the richest deal of the winter so far. Bellinger’s bounce-back performance proved he’s still an elite contributor, and New York paid a premium to keep his left-handed bat in the Bronx. This contract solidifies the Yankees’ outfield and keeps a key piece of their championship puzzle in place.\n\nWith Jose Ramirez’s reworked $175 million deal also making headlines, the market is clearly robust for elite talent. As spring training approaches, expect a few more dominoes to fall, but for now, these 10 deals define the financial landscape of the 2026 season.\n\nThe post MLB: Ranking the top 10 richest free agent signings of 2026 offseason appeared first on The Big Lead.",

It was January 26, 1992, in Super Bowl XXVI, and Washington jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead over the Buffalo Bills. On the Bills' first second-half possession, linebacker Kurt Gouveia intercepted a Jim Kelly pass, nearly returning it for a touchdown. Gerald Riggs hammered the ball into the end zone, and it was 24-0 Redskins.\n\nREDEMPTION!\nJanuary 26, 1992\n\nFour years after \"The Fumble\" in the AFC Championship with the #Browns in Denver, running back Earnest Byner scores the first touchdown of Super Bowl XXVI en route to the Redskins' third Super Bowl title.#HTTR #RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/FWP0mbSpwV\n\n— Kevin Gallagher (@KevG163) January 26, 2026\n\nEarly in the final quarter, Mark Rypien, Earnest Byner, the Hogs, and the Posse (Art Monk, Gary Clark, Ricky Sanders), Charles Mann, Wilber Marshall, Darrell Green, and the rest of the Redskins were destroying the AFC Champion Bills 37-10. The game's final several minutes were anticlimactic, much less intense, with cameras showing Redskins on the sidelines laughing and enjoying themselves on their way to another Super Bowl championship, as the Bills scored two late scores for a 37-24 final.\n\nIt was Joe Jackson Gibbs' fourth Super Bowl with Washington and the third he had won.

    "title": "On This Day (27th January 1973) David Young Plays Part In Crucial Win",
    "description": "Roker Report pays tribute to David Young, whilst also looking at the sad demise of another SAFC new boy.",
    "fullText": "Roker Report were saddened to learn of David Young’s passing earlier in the month, so for our latest ‘On This Day’ feature we have decided to look at the context surrounding a game where the Sunderland defender excelled…\n\nGiven the FA Cup exploits that soon followed it is easy to forget that Bob Stokoe’s initial target when appointed as Sunderland manager in late 1972 was to steer the club away from the danger of relegation. It is understandable of course that once the cup run started gathering pace ties against some of the big boys took most of the focus, but in the background league form remained important and slowly but surely the new gaffer dragged the Lads up the Division Two table.\n\nThe improvements were due mainly to Stokoe getting the best out of the players already at the club, but he did look to bring a couple of new faces into the mix as well and in January brought three new buys into the group having used the spare time on his hands due a flu enforced string of match postponements to dip into the transfer market. First through the door was David Young, who was soon followed by his ex Newcastle United teammate Ron Gurthie, two solid performers that were expected to help tighten things up, whilst the search for attacking reinforcements continued a while longer after serious interest in striker John O’Hare was rebuffed.\n\nIronically, Guthrie’s arrival was delayed due to him also suffering with illness, but Young quickly settled in – his old gaffer at St James’ Park Joe Harvey being happy to let him move on for a knock down price as a thank you for his service on Tyneside (and not, presumably, because Harvey had been best man at Stokoe’s wedding!). Comfortable in both defence and midfield, this flexibility later secured Young’s spot on the bench in the cup final and was a big talking point prior to his debut, with Stokoe thought to be considering him as a sweeper. In the end he opted to hand his new recruit a more traditional role at centre back and the outcome proved him right – Young helping earn a clean sheet as Sunderland swept Brighton & Hove Albion aside 4-0.\n\nIt was the first home win in over three months and with Young appearing cool and composed his presence was said to have raised the levels of some of the less experienced players around him. A 14-day signing rule meant that he then had to sit out the first few games of the cup adventure, but back in the league he impressed again during a draw at Swindon Town and then retained his place for a crucial game with Millwall that took place on this day. Joining him in the starting XI meanwhile was John ‘Yogi’ Hughes, brother of crowd favourite Billy, who had been brought in from Crystal Palace.\n\nStokoe had perhaps guessed that his old adversary Brian Clough would want to veto any approaches to Nottingham Forest for ex Roker man O’Hare, and upon learning that ex Celtic hero Yogi was keen to get back north moved his attentions to the big man (hence his nickname, in reference to the cartoon character Yogi Bear). Making his debut four days later his playing career was about to come to an abrupt stop, whereas Young gave another commanding display.\n\nThe first half saw the Lads and Lions going back and forth at each other with both defences being put under extreme pressure. With Young refusing to let his side crack though, the hosts were able to hang onto another clean sheet and then make the most of that foundation with two goals after the break. The first goal came moments after the restart and was from Dennis Tueart, who collected a pass from Yogi and struck a ferocious drive into the corner, with Bobby Kerr getting the clincher when Tueart turned provider with eight minutes to go.\n\nIt had been tense at points and it was just as well that Young did such a good job, for Millwall did have their moments even after they had gone behind, yet the one time they thought they had got through – Alan Dorney putting the ball into the net – Roy Keane’s would be pal Eamon Dunphy was adjusted to have been offside. It was a tight call admittedly, and would have no doubt been discussed at length in the queues for FA Cup 4th round tickets that began to form around the ground immediately after full time.\n\nThe points that had just been won and the continuation of an encouraging unbeaten run that was forming under the new management would have also been part of the wider conversation, and it’s highly likely that Yogi would have been spoken about too, as whilst he was already known to be cup tied and would therefore be ineligible to play against Charlie Hurley’s Reading, he had shown some nice touches and seemed promising. His signature had attracted the largest league gate on Wearside for over a year, and initial match reports backed up the feeling that he had played well, but little did people know that following a tackle only seconds after kick-off he was already feeling a problem in his knee that would actually make this his swansong. There was no obvious indication even of him even having an issue at first however, and it was midweek before the local press found that fluid had since formed on his knee since and he would therefore be seeing the club doctor.\n\nA seemingly innocuous niggle at first, the story only really began to pick up pace in the period that followed. Even when Vic Halom was signed in February to partly act as cover the general feeling was that Yogi would be back in another couple of weeks, and so it came as a huge surprise when at the end of March the club accepted medical advice that he would not be able to play again. The issue having grown steadily worse since the Millwall date seemingly, Stokoe when confirming the news was clearly very disappointed but assured Hughes that his contract would still be honoured.\n\nAs for Young, he too suffered a setback in the next league fixture when he badly sprained his ankle away at Sheffield Wednesday. The issue led to Richie Pitt’s loan at Arsenal being terminated after only three days, but whilst that saw him taking over in the cup side Young, once fully fit again, continued to be an important part of the league team that eventually finished 1972-73 in sixth place – an incredible achievement in itself given that they were hovering near the bottom when he debuted.\n\nHe then started the following campaign as a first choice and featured in all four of Sunderland’s European Cup Winners Cup outings before moving on to Charlton Athletic in 1974. A promotion winner with the Addicks and then Southend United also, Young evidently took the same level of know-how with him to those two clubs that he had shown on Wearside previously. Although he then settled down south and worked in sport centre management after retiring from playing, he often returned to the area to meet his old Roker teammates and alongside them was awarded the Freedom of the City of Sunderland in 2022.\n\nSunderland 2 (Tueart 49’, Kerr 81’) – Millwall 0\n\nSunderland: Montgomery; Malone, Watson, Young, Guthrie; B Hughes, Kerr, Horswill,  Porterfield, Tueart; J Hughes Unused: Pitt",

    "description": "“As the women’s game continues to grow, stories like Paxton’s become even more important”, writes Charlotte Patterson",
    "fullText": "There’s a particular kind of anticipation that surrounds a young footballer on the brink of breaking through.\n\nIt’s not the kind of loud explosive hype that accompanies a marquee signing, but something quieter, steadier and often more meaningful — the feeling that a club’s identity is renewing itself from within.\n\nSunderland Women have long been defined by their pathway, their commitment to youth and their belief that the next generation should be shaped in red and white from the earliest stages. In recent months, one name has begun to embody that philosophy with growing clarity: Chloe Paxton.\n\nHer rise has been gradual, deliberate, and deeply rooted in the region’s footballing culture. Yet the recent photos and videos of her training with the senior squad have shifted her story into a new phase.\n\nThey aren’t just snapshots of a promising teenager — they’re a signal of intent. They show a player trusted by the coaching staff, welcomed by senior professionals and increasingly seen as part of Sunderland’s future.\n\nFor supporters, these glimpses have sparked excitement; for the club, they represent the continued success of a pathway that’s produced some of the most recognisable names in English women’s football. And for Paxton herself, they mark the beginning of a transition she has worked toward for years.\n\nHer journey didn’t begin at Sunderland and nor did it begin within the formal academy system. Instead, it began in the grassroots world of North East schools football, where she made history long before she pulled on a Sunderland shirt.\n\nDuring the 2019/2020 season, Paxton became the first girl ever selected for a Newcastle Boys’ representative team in the 125‑year history of the association, breaking a barrier that had stood since 1892.\n\nThe Newcastle Schools FA records this milestone with pride, noting her selection for the Under‑13 boys side as a landmark moment in their long and storied history. It was a testament not only to her ability but to her determination to compete at the highest level available to her, regardless of convention.\n\nThat early achievement says much about her character — and those who’ve worked with her echo that sentiment. Indeed, one coach described her in unmistakable terms:\n\nChloe Paxton is an absolute warrior. She came into SAFC Women’s Academy at U14s, and before that she played in a boys’ team.\n\nShe had a really bad injury in her last season at U16s which kept her out for a year, but she never gives up, so I knew she would come back stronger. She is a tough character on the pitch — no one will get past her — but also a really nice person off the pitch.\n\nBefore her injury, at U15s she was on the England radar, so I think they might still be keeping track of her.\n\nThis insight reinforces what her journey already suggests: that Paxton has always been someone who seeks out the toughest challenges, embraces adversity, and refuses to be defined by setbacks. That mindset has carried her through every stage of her development and is now propelling her toward the senior setup at Sunderland.\n\nThis season, her performances for the Professional Game Academy have been central to her growing reputation. Sunderland’s December update on the PGA programme described a positive start to the campaign, highlighting the strength of the group, the quality of performances and the progress of individual players.\n\nAlthough the article didn’t highlight specific players, the broader context reflects the environment in which Paxton has been thriving: a competitive, ambitious academy designed to prepare players for senior football through high‑level coaching, structured development, and exposure to challenging fixtures.\n\nWithin that environment, Paxton has stood out for her consistency, intelligence and composure.\n\nHer style of play is defined by clarity and control. Whether operating as a defender or stepping into midfield zones, she reads the game with a maturity that belies her age. She anticipates danger early, positions herself intelligently and makes decisions that slow the tempo rather than speed it up.\n\nAdditionally, her passing is purposeful and precise, and she carries the ball with a confidence that suggests she isn’t merely participating in the game but shaping it.\n\nWhat makes Paxton particularly impressive is her ability to defend proactively.\n\nShe steps into passing lanes, cuts off angles and forces opponents into less threatening areas. She doesn’t rely solely on physicality or last‑ditch interventions; instead, she uses her understanding of space and timing to prevent problems before they arise. This kind of defensive intelligence is rare in young players and is often a sign of someone who’s spent years studying the game, not just playing it.\n\nHer calmness in possession is another defining trait.\n\nUnder pressure, she doesn’t panic. Instead, she scans early, chooses sensible options and maintains control even when opponents attempt to disrupt her rhythm. This composure has made her a stabilising presence for the PGA side and someone teammates look to when the game becomes chaotic or when leadership is required.\n\nHer development hasn’t gone unnoticed.\n\nThe coaching staff at Sunderland have increasingly integrated her into senior training sessions, giving her the opportunity to test herself against experienced professionals and adapt to the speed and physicality of the WSL2 environment. These sessions are not ceremonial — they’re earned, and they reflect a belief that she’s ready to be challenged, ready to learn and ready to take the next steps in her progression.\n\nAlthough Paxton hasn’t yet made her official senior debut, she’s already had a taste of first team football and during Sunderland’s pre‑season campaign, Paxton featured in the club’s victories over Celtic and Rangers, coming off the bench in both matches.\n\nThese appearances were more than symbolic. They were opportunities to experience senior football in a competitive setting, to feel the pace and intensity of the game, and to demonstrate that she could hold her own against strong opposition. For a young player, these moments are invaluable, building confidence, accelerating learning and providing a glimpse of what the future might hold.\n\nHer involvement in pre‑season also reflects the club’s broader philosophy, as Sunderland have always believed in giving young players meaningful opportunities and not minutes for the sake of it.\n\nWhen a player from the academy steps onto the pitch with the first team, it’s because the staff believe they’re ready for that moment. Paxton’s inclusion in those matches shows that she isn’t simply a long‑term project but a player who’s already knocking on the door.\n\nThe significance of her rise extends beyond her individual story — it speaks to the strength of Sunderland’s pathway and a system that’s produced some of the most influential players in the women’s game.\n\nFrom Jill Scott to Lucy Bronze to Jordan Nobbs, the club’s legacy is built on developing talent from within. That tradition continues today through the PGA, which has become a vital part of the club’s identity and a key driver of its long‑term strategy.\n\nThe pathway isn’t theoretical. Instead, it’s active, functioning and producing results, and Paxton’s emergence is the latest example of this. She represents the next generation of Sunderland players: shaped by the club’s values, supported by its infrastructure and inspired by the legacy of those who came before her.\n\nHer aspirations align perfectly with this environment and those who know her describe a player who’s driven, grounded, and quietly ambitious.\n\nShe isn’t interested in shortcuts or superficial attention. She’s focused on the work, the training sessions, the analysis and the incremental improvements that accumulate over time. Her goal isn’t simply to make the senior squad but to contribute meaningfully once she gets there. She wants to be a player who earns her place through performance, not potential.\n\nThis mindset has made her a natural fit within the senior training environment.\n\nShe listens, adapts, competes, absorbs information quickly and applies it with confidence. The senior players have responded positively to her presence, recognising both her talent and her attitude. In a squad that values unity, humility and collective effort, Paxton’s approach fits seamlessly.\n\nThe next steps in her journey will be crucial, as training with the senior team is a significant milestone, but it’s also a testing ground.\n\nIt allows coaches to evaluate her readiness, identify areas for growth and determine how she might fit into the squad’s tactical structure. For Paxton, it’s an opportunity to learn from experienced players, adapt to the demands of senior football and continue building the foundations for her eventual debut.\n\nHer performances for the PGA suggest she’s ready for this challenge.\n\nShe’s shown consistency, resilience, and a capacity to influence games. She’s also demonstrated leadership qualities even at a young age, and has become a player her teammates rely on. These attributes will serve her well as she navigates the transition to senior football.\n\nWhat makes this particularly exciting is the sense that she’s still growing.\n\nHer ceiling remains high and her development trajectory continues to trend upward. She has the technical foundation, tactical intelligence and mental resilience required to succeed at the senior level, and with continued support, guidance and opportunity, she has the potential to become a key figure for Sunderland in the years ahead.\n\nRecent training sessions with the senior squad aren’t a guarantee of immediate first team minutes, but they’re a clear indication that she’s on the right path. They show that the coaching staff see her as part of the club’s future and as someone worth investing time and resources into. They also show that she’s being prepared — not rushed or thrown in prematurely, but developed with intention and care.\n\nFor supporters, her rise is a reminder of what makes Sunderland special.\n\nThere’s something uniquely satisfying about seeing a young player come through the ranks, to be shaped by the club’s culture and values and begin to take their place within the senior setup. It creates a sense of connection, pride and continuity, reinforcing the idea that the club isn’t just a team but a community with a shared identity and long‑term vision.\n\nShe’s hardworking, intelligent, grounded, and ambitious. She represents the club’s commitment to youth development and its belief in building a future rooted in homegrown talent. Her rise is a reminder that the pathway is alive and thriving, and that the next generation of Sunderland players is already taking shape.\n\nAs the women’s game continues to grow, stories like Paxton’s become even more important.\n\nThey highlight the value of strong academies, the impact of thoughtful development and the excitement that comes from seeing young players take their first steps towards senior football.\n\nFor Sunderland, her emergence is a sign of progress and promise; for Paxton, it’s the beginning of a journey that could define her career and for everyone watching, it’s a chance to witness the rise of a player who could become a central figure in Sunderland’s future — a player whose talent, attitude, and potential make her one of the most intriguing young prospects in the club’s system.\n\nThe photos and videos of her training with the senior team are more than just glimpses. They represent the early chapters of a story still being written, one training session, one performance, and one opportunity at a time.\n\nSeeing Paxton on the bench against a WSL side in the FA Cup — albeit not featuring in the game — was once again an indication of the belief the club management has in her.",

    "description": "After a challenging ninety minutes against West Ham, what adjustments could be made for Monday’s visit of the Clarets?",
    "fullText": "Arsenal’s home defeat to Manchester United has left us as the only team left unbeaten at home and we’re all hoping for a huge response to ensure the streak continues as we welcome Burnley to the Stadium of Light.\n\nIn my opinion, the setup against West Ham was all wrong in terms of formation and personnel, and I’d be making a few changes to rectify it.\n\nI think an obvious start would be to bring in Lutsharel Geertruida at the base of midfield. He’s proven that he can do it, even when Granit Xhaka was in the starting eleven, and has more than enough quality on the ball to keep us ticking over at the base of midfield.\n\nThe back four in front of Robin Roefs would remain for me — despite Reinildo’s nightmarish runaround from Jarrod Bowen on Saturday. We’ve seen enough from those lads to know they’re not to be dropped after one defeat.\n\nI’d love to see a creative double act of Enzo Le Fée and Habib Diarra, but I’m aware that would mean leaving out Noah Sadiki. So, I’d grudgingly move Le Fée out to the left wing (as he’s still both our best winger in addition to being our best playmaker) whilst having Sadiki and Diarra as the runners ahead of Geertruida in midfield.\n\nI think this approach would give us a lot more control and endeavour while ensuring that we have maximum quality where we need it. For me, Diarra, Sadiki and Le Fée should always be on the pitch if possible, with Geertruida to keep the balance.\n\nTo round out the squad, Brian Brobbey would definitely keep his spot up front while I’d have Chemsdine Talbi come into the side on the right. We’ve seen that he’s often more effective on the left but in the absence of many other options, I’d like to have his work rate and ability to keep the ball out there.\n\nThis would see us back in our typical 4-3-3 and would hopefully plug the glaring gaps demonstrated against West Ham.\n\nI don’t often question Régis Le Bris, but his decision to play Trai Hume over Lutsharel Geertruida away to West Ham raised many eyebrows, including mine.\n\nIt was an experiment that definitely backfired and I have zero doubt that Le Bris will have held his hands up and taken responsibility for the imbalance it caused in the squad.\n\nThat said, I’m confident that we’ll see Geertruida start on Monday night against Burnley.\n\nThe Clarets have some solid midfielders even without their talisman Josh Cullen. Lutsharel is like a Swiss Army knife who can be deployed in many positions but for me and what I’ve seen this season, he is best suited to the “number six role” — something we desperately missed on Saturday.\n\nThe other changes I expect to see are Habib Diarra for Trai Hume and Chemsdine Talbi for Romaine Mundle — and Diarra’s impact was clear to see.\n\nHe was always looking to get the ball going forward and as a result of this, we finally scored in our “cursed” black third kit. He’s that good and even in his limited appearances for the Lads he’s seamlessly managed to slot in and create a few good opportunities. He has no problem getting up and down the pitch either, so his ability to cover in defence is equally as important as offering support in attack.\n\nI loved Mundle in the Championship but he’s just too predictable and appears slow against Premier League full backs.\n\nI’ve lost count of the amount of times he cuts inside onto his right foot, and his next touch is a tackle. We saw first hand what can happen when you go with your weaker foot — Jarrod Bowen showcased this with his cross for the opener.\n\nJust before AFCON, Talbi was finding space and creating chances. I much prefer him over Mundle and I’m sure Le Bris will be glad to have him back. Similarly to Diarra, his work rate and output is exceptional, and Burnley have some quick wingers who’ll need to be tracked.\n\nIf Diarra and Talbi do start, we’ll most definitely line up as a 4-3-3 and I think we’ll see either of our wingers closer to Brian Brobbey on the counter to receive the ball that our bulldozer of a centre forward will no doubt have held up to perfection.\n\nIt’s the most obvious analysis to conclude our defeat was due to missing Granit Xhaka. It would be hard to argue against this but I’m going to try to!\n\nWe’ve lost this season with Xhaka in the team — 2-0 against Burnley, 2-0 at Old Trafford, 1-0 against Fulham, 3-0 against Man City and 3-0 against Brentford. Nothing wrong with that and it’s totally acceptable, but Xhaka was in those teams and soon as we lose without him, he becomes the sole reason — but I don’t think it was the only reason.\n\nNearly everyone had an off-day and I think Noah Sadiki summed it up the best when he said that West Ham were “hungrier than us”. That’s the crux of the matter and a few people have mentioned how they had “one of those feelings”. Like most every other team, we’ll have days where we’re not at it and it often happens for us against teams outside the top six or seven, and we don’t give 100% effort.\n\nThat’s the standard that’s been set, and that’s the standard we need to show to get results in this league.\n\nOf course we missed Xhaka’s control and command, but we were also guilty of not being at it against the Hammers. I wasn’t disappointed when I saw the team. I was quite positive but it just didn’t work. When was the last time when we’ve seen Trai Hume as slack as he was, Reinildo getting skinned so easily or Romaine Mundle all at sea?\n\nWe could play the same formation against Burnley and get a tune, with everyone having a point to prove — although I’m sure changes will be made.\n\nI’d expect Lutsharel Geertruida to be given a place from the start, alongside Enzo Le Fée and Habib Diarra, who looked very lively when he came on. I don’t think Hume will be dropped and given Régis Le Bris’ man management skills, I’d expect Hume to be named as captain in a back four.\n\nChemsdine Talbi may come in for Mundle, with Eliezer Mayenda and Brian Brobbey completing a 4-3-3 lineup, and whatever the team, I’ll have faith that a response is coming.\n\nIf we’d beaten West Ham, this could well have been one of those games where we’d take our foot off the gas; instead, hopefully they’ll get a “Black Cats backlash”.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne advanced metric places the 2025–26 Seattle Seahawks defense among the greatest units in NFL history. That metric is DVOA, which stands for “Defense-adjusted Value Over Average.”\n\nDVOA measures a team’s efficiency by comparing the success of every single play to a league average, adjusted for situation and quality of opponent. In simpler terms, it evaluates how good a team truly is while accounting for context — down, distance, game situation, and who they’re playing.\n\nAaron Schatz, the chief analytics officer of FTN Fantasy and the creator of DVOA, recently shared a list of the best defenses by the metric dating back to 1978. Including playoff performances, this year’s Seahawks defense ranks sixth all-time in DVOA — a remarkable achievement considering the volume of elite units over the past four decades.\n\nHere's where the #Seahawks stand among the top teams in DVOA history, including the playoffs.

    "fullText": "CHICAGO, Illinois -- The ball was moving, the shots were falling, and Luka Dončić created magic in Chicago.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers continued their momentum in their road trip behind a season-high night from 3 from Dončić and an all-around effort, beating the Bulls 129-118 on the road at the United Center on Monday.\n\nDončić orchestrated one of his best performances of the year in the Lakers' fourth contest of a current eight-game road trip. He brought out every trick and move from his deep bag with multiple no-look, behind the back and cross-court passes against the Bulls.\n\nThe Slovenian finished with 46 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds while making eight 3s -- his season-high -- and 15 of 25 shots from the field.\n\nThe Lakers knocked down 16 three-pointers and shot 54% from beyond the arc against the Bulls, marking their third-highest totals this season in both makes and efficiency.\n\nThings were clicking for the Lakers in the first half; their 3-ball was falling, and they disrupted Chicago's offense. They forced the Bulls -- who are the best team in the NBA at not turning it over -- to commit over 10 turnovers in the first half, even causing multiple near shot clock violations that forced the Bulls to shoot a bad shot with the clock winding down.\n\nThe Lakers reached a 20-point lead in the second quarter -- their biggest of the game -- and it looked as though it was heading toward a blowout.\n\nThen, just like they did against the Mavericks, the Lakers had a horrendous run in the third quarter. The Bulls came out with more energy and opened the third, leading to a 24-12 run and the score within one.\n\nAs the Bulls pushed closer to taking back the lead, Dončić played hero for L.A. to keep Chicago at bay, scoring 20 points with four 3-pointers in the third quarter.\n\nDončić would continue his dominance into the fourth, with the help of Rui Hachimura and LeBron James.\n\nJames was the Lakers' halftime scoring leader with 20 points through two quarters. He played a large part in the Lakers' big start in Chicago, having multiple one-handed dunks and defensive sequences. James finished with 24 points.\n\nHachimura continued his damage in his new role as the team's sixth man. He started right where he left off in Dallas, hitting nearly every shot he took. Hachimura poured in 23 points on nine of 11 shooting (four made 3s).\n\nThe Lakers have won four of their last five games and will have much-needed reinforcements, with coach JJ Redick hinting that Austin Reaves will make his return within the road trip. They will face the Cleveland Cavaliers next on Wednesday.",

    "title": "“Sunderland’s Lindisfarne Liturgies”: A Third Reading!",
    "description": "John Wilson and Kelvin Beattie met up for coffee and to mull over their favourite Sunderland teams from over the years!",
    "fullText": "Not everyone who writes for Roker Report knows each other; in fact, many of us aren’t even in the North East.\n\nA couple of years ago, two of our “silver foxes” (Lars and Kelvin) met up on the beautiful island of Lindisfarne, as it had become clear that it was a place that was close to our hearts. Last summer, I decided to join the wise men, and so I met with Lars to revisit the Lindisfarne Liturgies.\n\nTo complete the trilogy, myself and Kelvin met up last month at the new arranged venue of the brilliant Barter Books in Alnwick, where we’d had a pre arranged subject of our favourite Sunderland teams of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\n\nI looked around the old train station and saw a very studious and distinguished-looking gentleman who was obviously making final adjustments to his lists in a waiting room/cafe area. Some of you might be aware of Kelvin as one of the voices of “On This Week” feature on the Haway the Podcast. I had a good idea of what Kelvin looked like, but if I had had to identify everyone in Barter Books by their voice, I would’ve identified him immediately!\n\nAfter having a general chat, we got down to business, revealing each other’s chosen teams.\n\nFrom my own point of view, it had taken me a full fun afternoon of research and going through my books and the internet to compile my squads. But as we talked, it became evident from some of our choices that “the rules” needed to be firmed up somewhat — picking a team from a particular decade isn’t so easy when some players turned out for the Black Cats from, say, 1968 to 1972.\n\nThere were many players caught in this “crossover” period so the teams that appear below are much closer to a team of 1965 to 1972, 1973 to 1982 and 1983 to 1990. We also agreed that we had to have seen the players live, and Jimmy Montgomery was allowed to be in two separate teams due to the longevity of his career.\n\nIf I encountered some inner turmoil over who to pick, I often resorted to the player who’d been credited with the most appearances for the Lads. But as we discussed, supposing Lionel Messi had played two or three games for us, would that allow him to appear in the “team of the decade” list? Maybe it would, we agreed.\n\nMany of the choices are players whom we just happened to like — our favourites and not necessarily the most skillful or with the most appearances. The 1960’s was the most difficult period as we were both just young lads, not even teenagers, and there weren’t many entrants before 1965, when we would’ve seen our first games.\n\nThe formation was also a problem, but we tried to not let this get in the way too much, with the old fashioned line up of right back, centre half, left back, right half, left half, inside left, inside right, right winger, left winger and centre forward being loosely adopted — in modern parlance, it would be 3-2-2-3.\n\nMontgomery, Irwin, Hurley, Todd, Ashurst, Herd, Baxter, McNab, Suggett, Clough, Mulhall\n\nI have to admit that I never saw Clough play but in all seriousness, I couldn’t leave out one of the greatest goal scorers in our history — and a big debate here was whether to go for Dick Malone or Cec Irwin. Choices!\n\nMontgomery, Malone, McNab, Todd, Hurley, Harvey, Herd, Suggett, Martin, Baxter, Mulhall\n\nWe were in much more comfortable territory when we moved into the 1970’s.\n\nOur 1970’s teams are quite similar — except I couldn’t remember Docherty. We also disagreed on the era into which we should place the recently-departed Gary Rowell, with Kelvin opting to put him in his 1980s squad.\n\nMontgomery, Chisholm, Watson, Clarke, Bolton, Robson, Hughes, Arnott, Kerr, Rowell, Tueart\n\nMontgomery, Docherty, Watson, Clarke, Bolton, Kerr, Towers, Porterfield, Hughes, Halom, Tueart\n\nTypical of the free-flowing conversation we’d had all morning, we happened to sit right in front of the sports section in the library.\n\nA Chris Waddle autobiography stared us in the face, so cue a Waddle chat. There was also a Geoff Hurst autobiography, so cue Hurst chat, the 1966 World Cup, etc! It was that kind of morning.\n\nThe 1980s are almost up to date in my head, so it’s even less of a problem.\n\nTurner, Burley, Bennett, Elliott, Agboola, Armstrong, Gates, Bracewell, Cummins, Gabbiadini, Owers\n\nSubs: Venison, Pascoe, MacPhail\n\nTurner, Venison, Bennett, Elliott, Atkins, Pickering, Bracewell, Proctor, Cummins, Gabbiadini, Rowell\n\nAs you can see, there were many crossovers, differing memories and favourites, but generally similar teams. We sometimes dabbled with formations to fit our favourite players in, but it was just a bit of fun!\n\nSometimes it was like choosing your favourite child; so much so that Kelvin wanted to give a mention to the following players who just missed the cut…\n\nKeith Coleman, John Parke, Bobby Park, Barry Siddall, Wilf Rostron, Richie Pitt, Steve Whitworth, Mel Holden, Clive Walker and Leighton James.\n\nIs it a coincidence that as we went through the eras, the number of managers increased from two, to three, to four?\n\nWe could’ve spent all day discussing our teams — especially in the serene surroundings of Barter Books — and it was great to meet Kelvin and put a face to the dulcet tones. Hopefully we can catch Lars when he’s next in the country, bring in some new faces, and compile a fourth reading of the Lindisfarne Liturgies this summer.",

    "fullText": "After the dismissal of Dino Toppmöller at Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend, the first rumors about possible successors quickly began to circulate.\n\nWith Xabi Alonso, even a name from the very top shelf emerged, but according to reports, the top candidate was former RB Leipzig coach Marco Rose, whom SGE boss Markus Krösche knows from the RB cosmos.\n\nHowever, last night it slowly but surely leaked out that the candidate who is currently actually in advanced talks about a job in the Main metropolis had not previously been so persistently linked with the coaching position at SGE.\n\nAs reported by 'Bild' and 'Sport1', and as first picked up by the portal 'AbsolutFußball', the hottest lead currently points to the Dane Jacob Neestrup. Negotiations are reportedly not yet concluded, but are on a good path.\n\nNeestrup is currently under contract with FC Copenhagen, where he has been coaching for some time. His contract with the Danish top-flight club runs until 2029. Should Eintracht decide on him, a transfer fee would therefore have to be paid.\n\nThe 37-year-old has recently been quite successful with Copenhagen: last year he won both the championship and the cup.\n\nWhat do you think? Could Neestrup be the right man to lead SGE out of the crisis? Feel free to write your thoughts in the comments.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares hit a new record on Tuesday as investors hoped for the best from a barrage of U.S. large-cap earnings, though uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump’s latest tariff moves on South Korea boosted gold and silver.\n\nAccusing South Korea’s legislature of \"not living up\" to its trade deal with Washington, Trump late on Monday said he would increase tariffs on imports from Asia’s fourth-largest economy into the U.S. to 25%.\n\nStocks appeared to take the news in stride, with Nasdaq futures up 0.5%, as investors geared up for a slew of earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Tesla starting on Wednesday.\n\nEven South Korea’s KOSPI quickly reversed earlier losses to surge by more than 2%, hitting a new peak. European stocks are braced for a higher open, with EURO STOXX 50 futures up 0.3%.\n\n\"Enthusiasm over the most eventful earnings week of the season has investors raising exposure to tech shares ahead of four of the Magnificent Seven reporting results,\" said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nOn Trump’s higher tariffs on South Korea, Torres believed a visit from South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan to Washington as soon as this Friday could \"ease tensions and buy its government some additional time to improve relations.\"\n\nStill, the uncertainty lifted safe-haven gold by 1% to $5,065 an ounce, just shy of an all-time high of $5,110, while silver gained 4% to $108 an ounce, not far from a record of $117.70 that was set on Monday.\n\n\"The frenetic nature of uncertainty, coupled with a weaker dollar, have been the primary contributors to this latest leg higher (for gold),\" said Christopher Louney, a commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nLouney said history suggested the current gold rally could run into early September or mid-December this year, adding that prices could go as high as $7,100 per ounce at the end of the year based on its 2025 performance.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9% to hit a new record high. The Nikkei gained 0.7%, even with the recent sharp rebound in the yen clouding the outlook for Japan’s vast export sector.\n\nChinese blue chips rose 0.2%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 1%.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is coming under fire again in the first few weeks of 2026 as a growing range of factors - including Washington’s desire for a weaker currency and Trump’s erratic policymaking - prompts a rethink of investors’ optimistic assumptions for a period of greenback stability.\n\nIts latest slump to more than four-month lows was driven by sharp gains in the Japanese yen starting on Friday when chatter about rate checks by the New York Fed fuelled the risk of a joint U.S.-Japan intervention to halt the yen’s slide.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.2% to 154.55 yen on Tuesday, having lost a staggering 2.6% over the past two sessions, which was well below the 160 yen level that is viewed as a line in the sand for Japanese authorities.\n\nAgainst six major currencies, the greenback was flat at 97.12, near a 4-1/2 month low of 96.8.\n\nIn the Treasuries market, the benchmark 10-year yield edged up 2 basis points to 4.2292% after falling for four straight sessions away from a recent peak of 4.313%.\n\nWorries about another U.S. government shutdown are also brewing in the background, with Republicans and Democrats at odds over funding for Trump’s Department of Homeland Security after the fatal shooting of a second U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\n\nOil prices fell on Tuesday as investors kept an eye on a resumption in supply from Kazakhstan. Brent crude futures dropped 0.7% to $65.13 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.6% to $60.25.",

    "description": "Mandelbort benchmark: Emacs (native-comp) runs 10x slower than Java or Truffle\nimplementation...",
    "fullText": "So I’ve been working on an interpreter for Emacs Lisp using the GraalVM Truffle framework for a while now. As I’ve just completed its AST interpreter and a bytecode interpreter, I guess its time to give it a little write-up (or rather, some random babbling of various tricks).\n\nAlthough the Truffle interpreter covered here is for Emacs Lisp only, most of the following should also be applicable to other Lisp dialects and maybe other Truffle-based language implementations.\n\nThe Mandelbrot benchmark above involves quite a lot of floating point operations, which Emacs seems bad at. So you can say this benchmark is cheating and I guess Emacs can perform much better in some fixnum benchmarks that involves only integers or list operations.\n\nNicolas Laurent, a TruffleRuby contributor has written a great introductory tutorial for Truffle, but in case you want a TL;DR:\n\nHow? One may also think of Truffle as a way to instruct Graal to perform super aggressive inlining (called “partial evaluation or Futamura projections“). For example, (+ 1 2) in a Lispy language may parse into an AST as follows:\n\nUpon compilation, the compiler might attempt to inline, like, everything:\n\nThat is, having Graal JIT-compile your AST interpreter is essentially JIT-compiling the interpreted program: we go from an AST to a compiled, constant-folded form.\n\nLet’s have a look at a lengthier example:\n\nThe code above is a barebone bytecode interpreter implemented with Truffle. @CompilationFinal tells Graal to treat instructions as constants when compiling, and @ExplodeLoop tells Graal to unroll loops aggressively. With these, we now have a simplistic bytecode JIT compiler, and the bytecode above partial-evaluates to:\n\nAnd the above further simpifies into:\n\nDepending on the stack frame type, Graal might be able to recognize frame.getInt(0) as a local variable and make further optimization:\n\nGraal offers a tool called Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV) to visualize compilation graphs. The following graph was produced by Graal running said bytecode:\n\nExactly what we’ve described above.\n\nPartial evaluation alone is not enough for an efficient JIT implementation. For example, we expect (+ 1 2) and (+ 1.0 2.0) to compile to different instructions (maybe ADD and FADD respectively), but for dynamic languages, we don’t always know the argument types at compile time. And this is exactly what speculative compilation (or speculation) can help with.\n\nBasically, without speculation, the compiler might compile (+ x y) into:\n\nWith speculation, the compiler can somehow guess from previous calls what types x, y are of, and put irrelevant paths in a separate interpreted slow path:\n\nThe interpretedSlowPath usually involves invalidating the current compilation and re-specializing the AST node. Truffle languages usually achieve this by using a mutable @CompilationFinal state field and a special compiler directive transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate():\n\nWhenever there is an active state, the compiler treats state as @CompilationFinal and compiles only the active path upon compilation; whenever the state assumptions are invalidated, the specialize method is responsible for invalidating the current compilation and adjusting the state so that the node can be recompiled correctly.\n\nThis pattern allows us to realize tons of advanced JIT techniques, including:\n\nSplitting: A highly polymorphic AST graph, however, can impact performance. One way to handle this is making the some parent nodes polymorphic by deep copying the sub-tree.\n\nHowever, it is definitely not fun having to hand-rolling all these ourselves. Instead, Truffle provides a powerful DSL (read: Java annotations) that generates all the boilerplate for us. Using the DSL, The SpeculativeAdd node above is as simple as a few @Specialization:\n\nThe code above asks Truffle annotation processor to generate a SpeculativeAddNodeGen class implementing specialization and polymorphism logic.\n\nThe above specializes the AST nodes. But to supply values to the nodes, you will need variables. It turns out that Truffle offers VirtualFrame exactly for this purpose. Storing local variables on a Frame, you can specialize the slots to Object or primitive types so as to remove boxing/unboxing costs. See SLWriteLocalVariableNode.java and SLReadLocalVariableNode.java for how easily one can speculate about unboxed storage of local variables.\n\nEmacs Lisp has over a thousand built-in functions, each requiring a dedicated Node implementation. Even if Truffle DSL generates Plus/Minus/Times/...NodeGen for us, we really don’t want to initialize all those functions ourselves:\n\nFortunately, Truffle provides @GenerateNodeFactory. If you annotate your AddNode with it, Truffle generates a AddNodeFactory for you and the code above becomes:\n\nNo, @GenerateNodeFactory is not about creating more FactoryFactoryFactories, and nice things happen when you put nodes in inner classes:\n\nI found this usage in the GraalPy codebase and didn’t see it documented anywhere. But it is definitely worth mentioning here in case anyone also has thousands of built-in functions to implement.\n\nLisp languages offer macros for metaprogramming and dynamic AST generation. For example, an unless form may expand to:\n\nEmacs Lisp chooses to expand macro at runtime. Using Truffle’s replace method, it is quite straightforward to come up with a MacroNode:\n\nHowever, runtime macro evaluation brings some implications impacting the overall interpreter design:\n\nWhether a node is a macro node or a function call node affects the AST. In the unless example above, the AST is as follows:\n\nAll arguments are passed “raw” for macro nodes. If unless were a function, arguments are evaluated before the function call and the AST would be:\n\nNow, with runtime macro expansion, we cannot know for centain (at declaration time) whether (something a b) is a call-node or a macro-node. And the only way is to have a call-or-macro-node that dynamically switches to call/macro nodes at runtime.\n\nTruffle frees us from doing register allocation, but we still need to allocate a frame slot for every local variable ourselves:\n\nFor some languages, slot allocation can be done at parse time, but not with runtime macros:\n\npcase-let is a macro that introduces new let forms, declaring new variables. Since macros expand at runtime, it means we also assign slot numbers to those variables at runtime.\n\nThis is fine: we can always introduce more states in our AST and keeping a slot count is not a big deal. The only problem is that Truffle requires knowing the frame size (total slot counts) at declaration time, which I don’t think is possible with Emacs Lisp. So, we need another trick to handle this.\n\nFor a Truffle frame, we need to know its size before hand. How do we handle a dynamic number of variables? Do you implement variable spilling yourself? Well, I did, only to find that there is better way weeks later.\n\nI discovered this technique from the GraalJs codebase. A suggestion for anyone trying to use Truffle for a real-world language: when implementing a feature, look into GraalJs, GraalPy, Espresso or TruffleRuby for how they implement that.\n\nSo Truffle offers two types of frames: VirtualFrame and MaterializedFrame:\n\nThe technique is quite simple: when introducing new variables, just allocate a new VirtualFrame for them and store the current frame in it. Let’s step through how this program executes with the technique:\n\nWhen Truffle calls this function, it allocates a VirtualFrame according to the RootNode of the function. Typically, one wants one slot for each argument, so the frame should probably be:\n\nEntering the first let scope, we allocate a new virtual-frame@1 for the xx variable. However, since we need to be able to access variables from outer scopes, we need to chain these frames up. The simplest way is to store the upper frame in one of the slots of the new frame:\n\nWell, actually no. Remember? We need to materialize the upper frame before storing it anywhere:\n\nEntering the second let scope, similarly, we now have:\n\nIf implemented correctly (that is, materialized frames are only stored within the “frame chain”), Truffle will recognized the frames as part of the current frame and make them virtual. And, hooray, now we have a dynamically-sized frame as good as a static one:\n\nIn Lisps, control flows, quotes and statement blocks are typically implemented as “special forms”:\n\nIn some lisps, these special forms are more-or-less identified by their corresponding symbols, in that you cannot define your own my-if by aliasing my-if to if. Well, this isn’t the case with Emacs:\n\nAnd it is (or was?) a feature that actually saw some usages:\n\nThe solution is quite simple: since we already have runtime macro-expansion, it is quite straightforward to just also put our special form logic there.\n\nNow we have talked about macros and special forms. Let’s go on to the last list form: function calls.\n\nIn most Lisps, there will be some “primitive” functions that have to be provided by the runtime, like arithmetic operations ((+ 1 x) and (- 1 y)) or list/cons-related functions ((car cons) and (cdr cons)). Semantically, +, -, car, cdr are all functions: one can use funcall to indirect-call them, or pass them to mapcar as a mapping function. However, we really want to some special processing for them: function calls are too costly for common constructs like these:\n\nInstead, we want to inline the addition instructions into the AST graph so that Truffle can specialize each node, hopefully turning each into a simple integer addition operation:\n\nFor subroutines/user-defined functions that are not intended to be inlined, you can still provide basic optimizations for them by using direct method dispatch (and caching) as much as possible, as is covered by some other tutorials out there (Writing a Language in Truffle. Part 3: Making my Language (Much) Faster and Graal Truffle tutorial part 9 – performance benchmarking).\n\nIt isn’t too surprising if we decide this is to be done when runtime macro-expansion happens:\n\nThe code here summarizes how we handle list forms like (maybe-func arg1 arg2): we create a placeholder node for it and defer any analysis until evaluation. When the node is executed, it replaces itself with the correct node implementation, possibly inlining some built-in functions.\n\nThe actual implementation is left as an exercise to the reader.\n\nThere’s one thing still missing in our pseudocode above: it does not handle function redefinitions. Once the nodes are inlined (e.g., (+ 1 2 3) inlined into (int-add (int-add 1 2) 3), the nodes won’t be aware of any function changes and we won’t be able to get back. This is problematic because when we redefine a function, we expect the change to take effect immediately:\n\nAn intuitive way to implement this is to introduce a check:\n\nThis works, and can be quite efficient when you caches the function value container for the variables/symbols (so that you don’t need to look up the symbol evey time). But there’s a more idiomatic way to do this: using Truffle Assumption and CyclicAssumption:\n\nThe advantage of assumptions is that Truffle is aware of it and can turn pull-based stability checks into push-based invalidations. It tracks compilation units that depend on a particular assumption, and automatically invalidates them when the assumption no longer holds. And that means, the currentFunctionStable.isValid() check above is essentially free, because the compiler simply assumes it to be true and can completely remove the other branch:\n\nOne can also use assumptions to constant-fold global variables (which I learned from how TruffleRuby handles some of their variables): assume a constant variable by default, and fall back to a dynamic read when a CyclicAssumption is invalidated too many times.\n\nInternally, GNU Emacs Lisp keeps local variables in a list (Vinternal_interpreter_environment) and it implements variable capturing by keeping the very list in the closure object.\n\nTruffle languages, as is shown above, usually use VirtualFrame objects for local variables, and they have very good reasons to do so: Truffle is aware of VirtualFrame and can inline the costs away. (Still remember the BytecodeInterpreter example above?)\n\nTo add to this, Emacs makes quite heavy use of the environment list in its oclosures (closures with associated metadata) as of Emacs 30:\n\nAn advice oclosure object has four fields: car, cdr, how, props, and we can clearly see these fields are stored right in the environment slot of the closure.\n\nI don’t have a solution for this. Currently, whenever oclosure requests it, my implementation produces a list of captured variables from the parent scope (stored as a MaterializedFrame), but it never propagates the changes backwards. Let’s hope this works. Otherwise, I don’t know, we might have to ditch MaterializedFrame/VirtualFrame altogether.",

    "description": "Columnist Natalie Wolchover checks in with particle physicists more than a decade after the field entered a profound crisis.",
    "fullText": "In July 2012, physicists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Europe triumphantly announced the discovery of the Higgs boson, the long-sought linchpin of the subatomic world. Interacting with Higgs bosons imbues other elementary particles with mass, making them slow down enough to assemble into atoms, which then clump together to make everything else.\n\nA couple of months later, I took a job as the first staff reporter at the nascent science magazine that would become Quanta. Turns out I was starting on the physics beat just as the drama was picking up.\n\nThe drama wasn’t about the Higgs particle; by the time it materialized at the LHC there was already little doubt about its existence. The Higgs was the last piece of the Standard Model of particle physics, the 1970s-era set of equations governing the 25 known elementary particles and their interactions.\n\nMore striking was what did not emerge from the data.\n\nPhysicists had spent billions of euros building the 27-kilometer supercollider not only to confirm the Standard Model but also to supersede it by uncovering components of a more complete theory of nature. The Standard Model doesn’t include particles that could comprise dark matter, for instance. It doesn’t explain why matter dominates over antimatter in the universe, or why the Big Bang happened in the first place. Then there’s the inexplicably enormous disparity between the Higgs boson’s mass (which sets the physical scale of atoms) and the far higher mass-energy scale associated with quantum gravity, known as the Planck scale. The chasm between physical scales — atoms are vastly larger than the Planck scale — seems unstable and unnatural. In 1981, the great theorist Edward Witten thought of a solution for this “hierarchy problem”: Balance would be restored by the existence of additional elementary particles only slightly heavier than the Higgs boson. The LHC’s collisions should have been energetic enough to conjure them.\n\nBut when protons raced both ways around the tunnel and crashed head-on, spraying debris into surrounding detectors, only the 25 particles of the Standard Model were observed. Nothing else showed up.\n\nThe absence of any “new physics” — particles or forces beyond the known ones — fomented a crisis. “Of course, it is disappointing,” the particle physicist Mikhail Shifman told me that fall of 2012. “We’re not gods. We’re not prophets. In the absence of some guidance from experimental data, how do you guess something about nature?”\n\nOnce the standard reasoning about the hierarchy problem had been shown to be wrong, there was no telling where new physics might be found. It could easily lie beyond the reach of experiments. The particle physicist Adam Falkowski predicted to me at the time that, without a way to search for heavier particles, the field would undergo a slow decay: “The number of jobs in particle physics will steadily decrease, and particle physicists will die out naturally.”\n\nThe crisis and its fallout made for years of interesting reporting, but sure enough, the frequency of news stories related to particle physics diminished. I fell out of touch with sources. More than 13 years on, in this first column for Qualia, a new series of essays in Quanta Magazine, I’m taking stock. Is particle physics dying, as Falkowski predicted? Can new physics still be found? What’s the future for particle physicists? Will artificial intelligence help? How much hope is left in the search for answers to the many remaining mysteries of the universe?\n\nSome particle physicists act as if there’s no crisis at all. The LHC is still running and will for at least another decade, and its operators are finding new sources of enthusiasm.\n\nIn the last couple of years, data handling at the collider has improved with the use of AI. Pattern recognizers can sort through the outgoing debris of proton collisions and classify collision events more accurately than human-made algorithms can. This helps the physicists to more accurately measure the “scattering amplitude,” essentially the probability that different particle interactions will occur. For instance, AI systems can determine more precisely how many top quarks arise in the aftermath of collisions versus the number of bottom quarks. Any statistical deviations from the predictions of the Standard Model could signify the involvement of unknown elementary particles.\n\nNovel particles as hefty as Higgs bosons would not be so subtle; they would have shown up already as pronounced bumps on data plots. But as Matt Strassler, a particle physicist affiliated with Harvard University, explained to me, the traces of lighter novel particles could still lie in so-called hidden valleys in the data. “There’s a huge amount of unexplored territory there,” he said. There might exist, for instance, an unstable type of dark matter particle that leaves its mark by occasionally arising and immediately decaying into an excessive number of muon-antimuon pairs. Detecting such an excess would point indirectly to the unstable particle’s existence. “For people who thought all the new physics is at high energies — they’re very disappointed right now,” Strassler said. “I don’t share that view. There are many opportunities for nature to provide clues at low energies.”\n\nSo far, though, no such indirect evidence of new physics has been detected. The more accurate the statistics have become at the LHC, the better they match the Standard Model. Michelangelo Mangano, a particle physicist at CERN, the laboratory that houses the LHC, said the collider today is like a tool for exploring the Standard Model’s predictions, and he considers this exploration worthwhile because not all consequences of the equations are easy to calculate. The search for new physics beyond the Standard Model is ongoing, Mangano said, but “the fact that it’s not giving positive results does not mean we are stuck, dead, or wasting our time.”\n\nThese questions are so fundamental that of course it’s worth nailing down every amplitude and checking every hidden valley, since we have the tool for the job. But for hunters of new physics, does the game end there?\n\nThe community wants to go bigger. CERN physicists want to build a Future Circular Collider, tripling the circumference of the LHC with a 91-kilometer tunnel beneath the Franco-Swiss border, to both probe higher energies and look for subtler signals. This FCC would initially collide electrons, which, unlike protons, are themselves elementary particles, with no substructure. Their clean collisions would allow more precise measurements of scattering amplitudes, making the FCC ultrasensitive to indirect signs of new physics. By the end of the century, the mega-collider would be upgraded to collide protons, as the LHC does now. Proton collisions are messier, but at the FCC they would achieve unprecedented energies — about seven times higher than the LHC can currently muster — so they have a chance, however slim, of revealing heavy particles beyond the LHC’s reach. (In theory, particle masses could range up to a million billion times greater than what the LHC energy scale can produce directly, so there’s no reason to expect them around the next bend.)\n\nAs of now, the FCC’s fate is unknown; formal approval and funding commitments by member countries won’t come before 2028.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. particle physicists are aiming to complement the European strategy by constructing a brand-new type of machine: a muon collider. Muons are elementary like electrons, but they’re 200 times heavier, so their collisions would be both clean and energetic (albeit not reaching the collision energies of the LHC). Both the selling point and the challenge of this newfangled type of machine is that it will require major technical innovations (with all the spin-off potential that can bring), because muons are highly unstable. They must be accelerated and collided mere microseconds after they’re created.\n\nDemonstrating the technology and then constructing the collider would take roughly 30 years, and that’s with federal funding. “We have to figure out how to do it in between 10 and 20 billion [dollars],” said Maria Spiropulu, a physics professor at the California Institute of Technology and co-chair of the committee behind a national report endorsing a muon collider program that came out in June 2025. Over the coming years, the Department of Energy will weigh whether to fund the proposal rather than competing science projects. What hurts its case is the lack of a “discovery guarantee,” which the LHC had with the Higgs boson.\n\nThen again, as the mathematical physicist Peter Woit mused on his blog, “Perhaps in our new world order where everything is controlled by trillionaire tech bros, the financing won’t be a problem.”\n\nDeliberations about a Chinese supercollider have come to naught, I’m told. Instead, China has decided to pursue a “super-tau-charm facility”: a lower-energy particle scattering experiment that would cost mere hundreds of millions of dollars instead of tens of billions. The facility will produce a lot of tau particles and charm quarks, partly to study whether taus ever shape-shift into muons or electrons. This kind of switching isn’t predicted by the Standard Model, but it does happen in some theoretical extensions of it.\n\nOkay, we might as well check. We’re desperate for new physics, and the price is good. But by definition it’s very difficult to know which shots in the dark are worth taking.\n\nAdam Falkowski, who sounded the death knell for particle physics back in 2012, used to be known for the sharp commentary he supplied on his blog Résonaances. But the Paris-based particle physicist hasn’t posted anything since 2022. He said that’s partly because he’s been tied up with fatherhood and partly because there hasn’t been much to say.\n\nWhen we caught up on a video call, Falkowski told me, “I am very skeptical about future colliders. For me it’s very difficult to get excited about it.” He sees momentum behind CERN’s FCC campaign, but personally he worries about the huge costs and timescales, and the fact that “there are absolutely no hints that something is there within the reach of the next collider.”\n\nFor his part, Falkowski has turned to the theoretical study of scattering amplitudes, a growing research area focused on the geometric patterns underlying particle interaction statistics, patterns that could point toward a truer perspective on the quantum world. The field seeks to reformulate the equations of particle physics in a different mathematical language in hopes that this language might extend to quantum gravity. “There is a very vibrant program in trying to understand the structure of the physical theories,” Falkowski said. “The hope is that with the help of machine learning, that there can be very fast progress in the coming years. I think that’s where the best things have happened.”\n\nBut amplitudeology, as this field is known, is abstract — it’s no atom-smashing experiment. Falkowski said he does think experimental particle physics is dying. He has watched talented postdocs switch to other research areas or take data science jobs. “I’m not sure they are getting the best of the best as they used to,” he said, “because the prospects of returns are so distant. If you want to change the world now, you will do AI; you will do something different from particle physics.”\n\nThis brain drain appears to be real. I spoke to Jared Kaplan, co-founder of Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude. He was a physicist the last time we spoke. As a grad student at Harvard in the 2000s, he worked with the renowned theorist Nima Arkani-Hamed to open up the new directions in amplitude research that are being actively pursued today. But Kaplan left the field in 2019. “I started working on AI because it seemed plausible to me that … AI was going to make progress faster than almost any field in science historically,” he said. AI would be “the most important thing to happen while we’re alive, maybe one of the most important things to happen in the history of science. And so it seemed obvious that I should work on it.”\n\nAs for the future of particle physics, AI makes worrying about it now rather pointless, in Kaplan’s view. “I think that it’s kind of irrelevant what we plan on a 10-year timescale, because if we’re building a collider in 10 years, AI will be building the collider; humans won’t be building it. I would give like a 50% chance that in two or three years, theoretical physicists will mostly be replaced with AI. Brilliant people like Nima Arkani-Hamed or Ed Witten, AI will be generating papers that are as good as their papers pretty autonomously. … So planning beyond this couple-year timescale isn’t really something I think about very much.”\n\nCari Cesarotti, a postdoctoral fellow in the theory group at CERN, is skeptical about that future. She notices chatbots’ mistakes, and how they’ve become too much of a crutch for physics students. “AI is making people worse at physics,” she said. “What we need is humans to read textbooks and sit down and think of new solutions to the hierarchy problem.”\n\nCesarotti was a high school junior when the Higgs boson was discovered. She grew up near Fermilab, the U.S. national lab in Illinois that houses the Tevatron, which was the world’s highest-energy particle collider before the LHC. (The top quark was discovered there in 1995.) This proximity taught her that a particle physicist was a thing you could be. Later, it turned out to be her thing. “What are the fundamental building blocks of the universe — those were the questions that I was most interested in knowing the answer to,” she told me. “But what people said was, ‘Particle physics is dead. Don’t do this.’”\n\nIt may have been a fair warning; Cesarotti has yet to land a permanent job as a rising particle physicist. The subfield has continued to shrink, she and others said, as faculty hiring committees and grad students go in other directions. “Definitely all this rhetoric that there was nothing to be found and you should give up on it — people listened,” she said. “And of course that means there are fewer people. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you’re pushing all these talented people out of trying to solve these problems into a field that it’s easier to make an impact on, then you’re setting yourself up for failure.”\n\nCesarotti echoed a sentiment I’d heard from others, which sounds correct to me as well: “Particle physics isn’t dead; it’s just hard.” It’s hard to know what to think about or look for. But the most devoted particle physicists are thinking and looking all the same.\n\n“It was easy for 125 years,” Strassler said. “One thing led to the next. That lucky century has, for now, at least in the medium term, come to an end. That could change tomorrow, or next century, or who knows.”\n\nA hint of a new lightweight particle could, in theory, show up at the LHC, or in some other experiment. Strassler is particularly excited about the study of radioactive thorium-229 decay, which could reveal variations in the fundamental constants. I’m slightly partial to experiments looking for “axions,” dark matter candidates that are so lightweight that they can act a little like light itself.\n\nOn the theory side, an obvious solution to the hierarchy problem could drop naturally out of the geometry behind scattering amplitudes. Or, if Kaplan is right, AI systems might someday suggest powerful new ideas for how the 25 particles of the Standard Model fit into a more comprehensive pattern — a possibility I didn’t foresee back when the crisis began.\n\nClearly, further progress toward the truth remains possible in particle physics. But there’s no discovery guarantee. I’ve had more than 13 years to think about it, and it remains a disturbing prospect: All the empirical clues we can glean about nature’s fundamental laws and building blocks might already be in hand. The universe may plan on keeping the rest of its secrets.",

    "fullText": "Recevez tous les soirs un résumé de l’actu importante avec Le Récap’\n\n« Souveraineté numérique » : dans un communiqué de presse envoyé le 26 janvier 2026, le Ministère chargé de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l’État annonce la couleur. Son projet : généraliser Visio, un outil de visioconférence conçu pour sevrer la France, et plus généralement l’Europe, de sa dépendance aux géants américains.\n\nAlors que Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype ou WebEx règnent en maîtres absolus sur nos réunions virtuelles depuis des années, le gouvernement, par la voix de David Amiel, ministre délégué chargé de la Fonction publique, officialise la généralisation de son alternative maison. D’ici 2027, l’ensemble des services de l’État auront l’obligation d’utiliser Visio.\n\nDéveloppé par la Direction interministérielle du numérique (DINUM), Visio coche toutes les cases de la souveraineté. Il ne s’agit pas d’une simple copie française de Zoom, mais d’un logiciel conçu avec plusieurs couches françaises.\n\nCôté hébergement, les données seront stockées chez Outscale, filiale de Dassault Systèmes, qui bénéficie du très strict label SecNumCloud de l’ANSSI. C’est la garantie que les données ne sont pas soumises aux lois extraterritoriales américaines. Visio intègrera aussi plusieurs fonctionnalités IA comme :\n\nActuellement testé par 40 000 utilisateurs, Visio va monter en puissance. Le CNRS, l’Assurance Maladie ou encore le ministère des Armées basculeront sur l’outil dès le premier trimestre 2026.\n\nVisio est déjà disponible aujourd’hui, mais est réservé à certains métiers publics, comme l’enseignement. Le gouvernement ne dit pas s’il ouvrira un jour sa solution souveraine au grand public.\n\nL’initiative est louable, mais le défi est immense. Aujourd’hui, l’administration française, comme le reste du monde, vit sous perfusion numérique américaine. Les systèmes d’exploitation, les suites bureautiques et même les messageries instantanées utilisées au sommet de l’État (on pense à WhatsApp, malgré les interdictions régulières) créent une dépendance systémique aux États-Unis et à leurs géants.\n\nLa réalité du terrain est souvent celle de la facilité : Teams est inclus dans la suite Microsoft 365, Zoom est devenu un verbe du langage courant et Google Meet fonctionne avec un simple lien. Tenter de déloger ces outils ne sera pas aisé : les habitudes sont difficiles à bouleverser. L’État français dispose d’autres alternatives déjà crédibles, notamment sur la messagerie sécurisée avec des solutions comme Tchap ou Olvid, mais il s’agit de solutions très confidentielles.\n\nMalgré cette réalité des usages, la bataille semble aujourd’hui difficilement critiquable. Laisser les conversations stratégiques du ministère des Armées ou les travaux du CNRS transiter par des serveurs étrangers pose un risque de sécurité évident. La dépendance stratégique vis-à-vis d’infrastructures externes fragilise l’État en cas de conflit diplomatique ou commercial : Donald Trump a le pouvoir de paralyser les administrations européennes s’il le souhaite. L’inverse n’est pas vrai.\n\nAutre élément mis en avant par Bercy : le coût. Selon Bercy, l’arrêt des licences payantes aux géants américains permettrait d’économiser 1 million d’euros par an pour chaque tranche de 100 000 utilisateurs.\n\nEn plus de cette annonce sur la vidéoconférence, d’autres chantiers commencent à voir le jour à échelle européenne. Parmi eux : les réseaux de paiement. Aujourd’hui, Visa et Mastercard ont un droit de vie ou de mort sur les transactions commerciales du continent. Un blocage pourrait être fatal pour l’économie européenne, même s’il est aujourd’hui hautement hypothétique.\n\nÀ l’avenir, l’Europe pourrait développer son propre réseau de paiement pour permettre des paiements dans la zone sans passer par VISA et MasterCard. Certains pays disposent déjà de leurs propres réseaux souverains (c’est le cas de CB en France), mais il n’existe pas de solution universelle. L’initiative Wero, à base de QR code, ouvre la porte à des nouveaux paiements hors des rails américains.\n\nToute l'actu tech en un clin d'œil\n\nAjoutez Numerama à votre écran d'accueil et restez connectés au futur !\n\nTous nos articles sont aussi sur notre profil Google : suivez-nous pour ne rien manquer !",

    "title": "New England Town",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "The town is the basic unit of local government and local division of state authority in the six New England states. Most other U.S. states lack a direct counterpart to the New England town. New England towns overlie the entire area of a state, similar to civil townships in other states where they exist, but they are fully functioning municipal corporations, possessing powers similar to cities and counties in other states. In the United States, New Jersey's system of equally powerful townships, boroughs, towns, and cities is the system which is most similar to that of New England; internationally, local government systems comparable to the New England town exist in much of Western Europe, such as the Gemeinden of Germany, the communes of France, and the freguesias of Portugal.\n\nNew England towns are often governed by a town meeting, an assembly of eligible town residents. The great majority of municipal corporations in New England are based on the town model; there, statutory forms based on the concept of a compact populated place are uncommon, though elsewhere in the U.S. they are prevalent. County government in New England states is typically weak, and in some states nonexistent. Connecticut, for example, has no county governments,[1] nor does Rhode Island.[2]\n\nBoth Connecticut and Rhode Island retain counties only as geographic subdivisions with no governmental authority, while Massachusetts[3] has abolished eight of fourteen county governments so far. Counties serve mostly as dividing lines for the states' judicial systems and some other state services in the southern New England states while providing varying (but generally limited) services in the more sparsely populated three northern New England states.\n\nTowns date back to the time of the earliest English colonial settlement, which predominated in New England, and they pre-date the development of counties in the region. Areas were organized as towns as they were settled, throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Town boundaries were not usually laid out on any kind of regular grid, but were drawn to reflect local settlement and transportation patterns, often affected by natural features. In early colonial times, recognition of towns was very informal, generally connected to local church divisions.\n\nThe entire land areas of Connecticut and Rhode Island had been divided into towns by the late 18th century, and Massachusetts was almost completely covered early in the 19th century. By 1850, the only New England state that still had large unincorporated areas was Maine; by the end of the 19th century, most areas in Maine that could realistically be settled had been organized into towns.\n\nEarly town organization in Vermont and much of New Hampshire proceeded in a somewhat different manner from that of the other New England states. In these areas, towns were often \"chartered\" long before any settlers moved into a particular area. This was very common in the mid to late 18th century—although there were towns which predated that period and were not part of this process in southeastern New Hampshire, such as Exeter. Once there were enough residents in a town to formally organize a town government, no further action was necessary to incorporate. This practice can lead to inconsistencies in the dates of incorporation for towns in this region. Dates given in reference sources sometimes reflect the date when the town was chartered, which may have been long before it was settled, and not the date when its town government became active. In other parts of New England, some \"future towns\" were laid out along these lines, but such areas would not be formally incorporated as towns until they were sufficiently settled to organize a town government.\n\nA typical town in the northern three states was laid out in a 6-by-6-mile (9.7 by 9.7 km) square. Each contained 36 sections, 1 mile (1.6 km) squares or 640 acres (260 ha). One section was reserved for the support of public schools. This was copied when the Continental Congress laid out Ohio in 1785–87.[5]\n\nMany early towns covered very large amounts of land. Once areas had become settled, new towns were sometimes formed by breaking areas away from the original existing towns. This was an especially common practice during the 18th and early 19th centuries. More heavily populated areas were often subdivided on multiple occasions. As a result, towns and cities in urbanized areas are often smaller in terms of land area than an average town in a rural area. Formation of new towns in this manner slowed in the later part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century, however. One late instance was the separation of Sugar Hill, New Hampshire, from the town of Lisbon in 1962. It has not taken place anywhere in New England in the last fifty years; boundary changes of any type are fairly rare.\n\nTowns are the basic building block of the New England municipality system, although several other types of municipalities also exist. Every New England state has cities. In addition, Maine also has a unique type of entity called a plantation. Beneath the town level, Connecticut has incorporated boroughs, and Vermont has incorporated villages.\n\nIn addition to towns, every New England state has incorporated cities. However, cities are treated in the same manner as towns under state law, differing from towns only in their form of government. Most cities are former towns that changed to a city form of government because they grew too large to have a town meeting as its legislative body; instead, a city's legislative body is an elected representative body, typically called the city council or town council or board of aldermen. City governments are typically administered by a mayor (and/or city manager). In common speech, people often generically refer to communities of either type as \"towns\", drawing no distinction between the two.\n\nThe presence of incorporated boroughs in Connecticut and incorporated villages in Vermont has influenced the evolution of cities in those states. In Connecticut in particular, the historical development of cities was quite different from in the other New England states, and at least technically, the relationship between towns and cities is today different from elsewhere in New England. Just as boroughs in Connecticut overlay towns, so do cities; for example, while Hartford is commonly thought of as a city, it is coextensive and consolidated with the Town of Hartford; governed by a single governmental entity with the powers and responsibilities of the Town being carried out by the entity referred to as the City of Hartford. In legal theory though not in current practice Connecticut cities and boroughs could be coextensive (covering the same geography as the town) without being consolidated (a single government); also a borough or city can span more than one town. In practice, though, most cities in Connecticut today do not function any differently from their counterparts elsewhere in New England. See the section below on boroughs and villages for more background on this topic.\n\nThere are far fewer cities in New England than there are towns, although cities are more common in heavily built-up areas, and most of the largest municipalities in the region are titled as cities. Across New England as a whole, only about 5% of all incorporated municipalities are cities. Cities are more common in the three southern New England states, which are much more densely populated, than they are in the three northern New England states. In early colonial times, all incorporated municipalities in New England were towns; there were no cities. Springfield, Massachusetts, for instance, was settled as a \"plantation\" (in colonial Massachusetts, the term was synonymous with town) as early as 1636, but the city of Springfield was not established until 1852.\n\nThe oldest cities in New England date to the last few decades of the 18th century, (e.g. New Haven, Connecticut, was chartered as a city in 1784). In New England, cities were not widespread until well into the 19th century. New Hampshire did not have any cities until the 1840s, and for many years prior to the 1860s Vermont had just one city. Even Massachusetts, historically New England's most populous state, did not have any cities until 1822, when Boston was granted a city form of government by the state legislature.\n\nIn most of New England, population is not a determining factor for what makes a city or town, and there are many examples of towns with larger populations than nearby cities. Massachusetts is one of the few states in the region that is an exception to this rule; the Massachusetts Constitution requires a town to have a population of at least 10,000 people before it can switch its government from a town meeting form to a city form. Nevertheless, even without a hard and fast population limit for city status, the practical threshold to become a city seems to be higher in the three southern New England states than in the three northern New England states. In Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, almost every city has at least 10,000 people, and all but a few have at least 20,000. In Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, however, there are a number of cities with fewer than 10,000 people, and there are five (three in Maine and two in Vermont) with fewer than 5,000.\n\nOver time, some of the distinctions between a town and a city have become blurred. Since the early 20th century, towns have been allowed to modify the town meeting form of government in various ways (e.g., representative town meeting, adding a town manager). In recent[when?] decades, some towns have adopted what effectively amount to city forms of government, although they still refer to themselves as towns. As a practical matter, one municipality that calls itself a town and another that calls itself a city may have exactly the same governmental structure. With these changes in town government, a reluctance to adopt the title of city seems to have developed, and few towns have officially done so since the early 20th century. In Massachusetts, nine municipalities (Agawam, Barnstable, Braintree, Franklin, Palmer, Randolph, Southbridge, West Springfield and Weymouth) have adopted Mayor-Council or Council-Manager forms of government in their home rule charters, and are therefore considered to be legally cities, but nevertheless continue to call themselves \"towns\". They are sometimes referred to in legislation and other legal documents as \"the city known as the Town of ...\" Greenfield, in December 2017, dropped the \"town\" designation, which some called \"embarrassing\" and which legislators said made paperwork more difficult.[6] Common parlance labeling a community a \"city\" or a \"town\" may have more to do with its size, whether its current size or its historical size and reputation.\n\nIn addition to towns and cities, Maine has a third type of town-like municipality not found in any other New England state, the plantation. A plantation is, in essence, a town-like community that does not have enough population to require full town government or services. Plantations are organized at the county level and typically found in sparsely populated areas. There is no bright-line population divider between a town and a plantation, but no plantation currently has any more than about 300 residents. Plantations are considered to be \"organized\" but not \"incorporated.\" Not all counties have them; in some southern counties, all territory is sufficiently populated to be covered by a town or a city.\n\nIn colonial times, Massachusetts also used the term \"plantation\" for a community in a pre-town stage of development (Maine originally got the term from Massachusetts, as Maine was part of Massachusetts until 1820, when it became a state via the Missouri Compromise). The term \"plantation\" had not been much used in Massachusetts since the 18th century. Massachusetts also once had \"districts\", which served much the same purpose. They were considered to be incorporated, but lacked the full privileges of a town. On August 23, 1775, in order for more representation for the Revolutionary War, 36 towns in Massachusetts and 6 in Maine were incorporated, effectively eliminating the district meaning. Maine and Rhode Island are also known to have made limited use of the district concept. Districts have not been at all common since the first half of the 19th century, and there have not been any districts anywhere in New England in over a century. Maine is the only New England state that currently has a significant amount of territory that is not sufficiently populated to support town governments; thus, it is the only New England state that still needs the plantation type of municipality.\n\nFor a historical example in New Hampshire, see Plantation number four.\n\nMost areas of New England never developed municipal forms based on the compact populated place concept. This contrasts with states with civil townships, which typically have extensive networks of villages or boroughs that carve out or overlay the townships.\n\nTwo of the New England states do have general-purpose municipalities of this type, however, to at least a limited extent. Connecticut has incorporated boroughs, and Vermont has incorporated villages. Such areas remain a part of their parent town, but assume some responsibilities for municipal services within their boundaries. In both states, they are typically regarded as less important than towns, and both seem to be in decline as institutions. In recent decades, many boroughs and villages have disincorporated, reverting to full town control.\n\nThe term \"village\" is sometimes used in New England to describe a distinct, built-up place within a town or city. This may be a town center, which bears the same name as the town or city (almost every town has such a place), or a name related to that of the town, or a completely unrelated name. The town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, for example, includes the villages of Barnstable Village, West Barnstable, Centerville, Marstons Mills, Osterville, Cotuit, and Hyannis. Except for the incorporated villages in Vermont, these \"villages\" are not incorporated municipalities and should not be understood as such. Towns do sometimes grant a certain measure of recognition to such areas, using highway signs that identify them as \"villages\", for example. These informal \"villages\" also sometimes correspond to underlying special-purpose districts such as fire or water districts, which are separately incorporated quasi-municipal entities that provide specific services within a part of a town — within Barnstable, the seven villages correspond to districts for fire, water, sewer and elementary schooling, for instance. (In Maine and New Hampshire, the term \"village corporation\" is used for a type of special-purpose district.) Many villages also are recognized as places by the United States Postal Service (some villages have their own post offices, with their names used in mailing addresses) or the United States Census Bureau (which recognizes some villages as census-designated places and tabulates census data for them). Towns with an example of the former, such as Richmond, Rhode Island, do not have a post office themselves, but instead use villages in town or villages in nearby towns as a mailing address. This leads to a weaker town identification in such towns, with residents more strongly identifying with the village they live in. However, villages or CDPs have no existence as general-purpose municipalities separate from the town (if they even have any legal existence at all), and are usually regarded by local residents as a part of the town in which they are located, less important than the whole.\n\nIt is possible for a Connecticut borough or Vermont village to become a city. In Connecticut, cities overlay towns just as boroughs do, and, just like a borough, a city can cover only a portion of a town rather than being coextensive with the town. This is rare today—only one or two examples remain—but it was more common in the past. At least one borough historically spanned more than one town: the borough of Danielsonville originally laid over parts of Killingly and Brooklyn, until the Brooklyn portion petitioned to be reorganized as a fire district and concurrently the Killingly portion was renamed Danielson by the General Assembly. There are no legal restrictions in Connecticut that would prevent a city or borough today from similarly overlaying the territory of more than one town, provided it is not consolidated with one of the underlying towns. Cities actually developed earlier in Connecticut than in the other New England states, and were originally based on the borough concept. At one time, all cities were non-coextensive; the practice of making cities coextensive with their towns was a later adaptation intended to mimic the city concept that had emerged in the other New England states. Over time, many non-coextensive cities have expanded to become coextensive with their parent town. As with boroughs, many have also disincorporated and reverted to full town control. These two trends have combined to make non-coextensive cities very rare in recent times; the only one currently incorporated is the city of Groton, located in the southwestern part of the town of Groton, Connecticut.\n\nIn Vermont, if a village becomes a city, it does not continue to overlay its parent town, but breaks away and becomes a completely separate municipality. Most cities in Vermont today are actually former villages rather than former towns, and are much smaller than a typical town in terms of land area. The above process has created several instances where there are adjacent towns and cities with the same name. In all cases, the city was originally the \"town center\" of the town, but later incorporated as a city and became a separate municipality.[7]\n\nAll three of the northern New England states (Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) contain some areas that are unincorporated and unorganized, not part of any town, city or plantation.[8][9] Maine has significantly more such area than the other two states.[10] Most such areas are located in very sparsely populated regions. Much of the barely inhabited interior of Maine is unorganized, for example.\n\nThe majority of the unincorporated areas in New Hampshire are in Coos County, and the majority of the unincorporated areas in Vermont are in Essex County. Two additional counties in New Hampshire and three additional counties in Vermont contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory. In Maine, eight of the state's sixteen counties contain significant amounts of unorganized territory (in essence, those counties in the northern and interior parts of the state). Four other counties contain smaller amounts.\n\nMost of these areas have no local government at all; indeed, some have no permanent population whatsoever. Some areas have a very rudimentary organization that does not rise to the level of an organized general-purpose municipal government (e.g., a town clerk's office exists for the purpose of conducting elections for state or federal offices). In general, unorganized areas fall into one of the three categories below.\n\nDuring the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as town boundaries were being drawn up, small areas would sometimes be left over, not included in any town. Typically smaller than a normal-sized town, these areas were known by a variety of names, including gores, grants, locations, purchases, surpluses, and strips. Sometimes these areas were not included in any town due to survey errors (which is the technical meaning of the term \"gore\"). Sometimes they represent small areas that were left over when a particular region was carved into towns, not large enough to be a town on their own. Some appear to have simply been granted outside the usual town structure, sometimes in areas where it was probably not contemplated that towns would ever develop. Over time, those located in more populated areas were, in general, annexed to neighboring towns or incorporated as towns in their own right. No such areas exist today in Massachusetts, Connecticut or Rhode Island, but some remain in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.\n\nAll three of the northern New England states contain some town-sized unorganized entities, referred to as \"unorganized townships\" (sometimes, just \"townships\") or \"unorganized towns\". Most of these are areas that were drawn up on maps in the 18th and 19th centuries as what might be termed \"future towns\", but never saw enough settlement to actually commence operation of a formal town government.\n\nAll three of the northern New England states also include at least one unorganized township that was once a town but has disincorporated and reverted to unorganized territory, generally due to population loss. Maine also has some unorganized townships that were once organized as plantations.\n\nMaine has significantly more unorganized territory than Vermont or New Hampshire. Fewer than 100 Vermont residents and fewer than 250 New Hampshire residents live in unorganized areas. In Maine, by contrast, about 10,000 residents live in unorganized areas. As a result, Maine has developed more of an infrastructure for administration of unincorporated and unorganized areas than the other New England states. The existence of this fallback probably explains why Maine has had significantly more towns disincorporated over the years than any other New England state. There have been numerous instances of towns in Maine disincorporating despite populations that numbered in the hundreds. While these were not large communities, they were large enough to realistically operate a town government if they wanted to, but simply elected not to. In Vermont and New Hampshire, disincorporation has, in general, not been brought up for discussion unless a town's population has approached single digits.\n\nIn general, coastal waters in the New England states are administered directly by either state or federal agencies and are not part of any town. Several towns, however, have chosen to include all or part of their corresponding coastal waters in their territory. Coastal waters include human-made structures built within them. In Connecticut, for example, an artificial, uninhabited island in Long Island Sound at the boundary with New York State, housing the Stratford Shoal Light, is not part of any town and is administered directly by the United States Coast Guard. In general, inhabited minor off-shore islands are administered as part of a nearby town and in some cases, are their own independent towns, such as the town of Gosnold, Massachusetts, which encompasses the Elizabeth Islands.\n\nUnlike municipalities in most other states, the United States Census Bureau does not classify New England towns as \"incorporated places\". They are instead classified as \"minor civil divisions\" (MCDs), the same category into which civil townships fall. The Census Bureau classifies New England towns in this manner because they are conceptually similar to civil townships from a geographic standpoint, typically exhibiting similar population-distribution patterns. Like civil townships, but unlike most incorporated municipalities in other states, New England towns do not usually represent a single compact populated place. Plantations in Maine are similarly classified as MCDs.\n\nThat New England towns serve, in essence, the same function as incorporated places in other states, but are not treated as incorporated places by the Census Bureau, can be a source of confusion. The Census classifications should not be understood to imply that New England towns are not incorporated, or necessarily serve a similar purpose to MCDs in other states in terms of governmental function or civic-identity importance. New England towns are classified as MCDs not because they are not \"incorporated\" but rather the data that the census gathers on places is analyzed based on different models (those of compact settled places and open rural places) that is not well represented by the New England Town system of organization. In order to better fit their own purposes, the Census only counts cities and certain fully urbanized towns as \"places\" in its categorization. In other towns, those with small built-up central villages, the Census designates one or more census-designated places (CDPs) and considers all other land to be parts of \"minor civil divisions\". This classification is done only for the Census's own data analysis, and otherwise has no connection to the actual organization or legal status of New England towns.\n\nThe census bureau does uniquely recognize towns, however, in that it classifies metropolitan areas in New England on the basis of town boundaries rather than county boundaries as it does in other parts of the U.S. Unique to New England is the New England city and town area, which is analogous to Metropolitan Statistical Areas in other parts of the U.S., except that it uses the town as its basic unit rather than the county.\n\nEven though the Census Bureau does not treat New England towns as \"incorporated places\", it does classify cities in New England as such. The rationale behind this is that cities are likely to be more thoroughly built-up and therefore more readily comparable to cities in other states than towns are. Boroughs in Connecticut and incorporated villages in Vermont are also treated as incorporated places.\n\nThat New England states, in general, regard cities and towns on equal footing, yet they are handled in two different ways by the Census Bureau, can be another source of confusion. The Census classifications should not be understood to imply that cities are incorporated but towns are not, or that cities and towns represent two fundamentally different types of entities. The Census classifies New England municipalities strictly based on whether they are towns or cities, with no regard to the actual population-distribution pattern in a particular municipality. All municipalities titled as cities are classified as incorporated places, even if their population-distribution pattern is no different from that of a typical town; towns are never classified as incorporated places, even if they are thoroughly built up. The ambiguity over whether certain municipalities in Massachusetts should be classified as cities or towns, and the Census Bureau's inconsistent handling of these municipalities (see the Statistics and Superlatives section below), further blurs matters.\n\nTo fill in some of the \"place\" data, the Census Bureau sometimes recognizes census-designated places (CDPs) within New England towns. These often correspond to town centers or other villages, although not all such areas are recognized as CDPs. In cases where a town is entirely or almost entirely built-up, the Census sometimes recognizes a CDP which is coextensive with the entire town. CDPs are only recognized within towns, not cities. Because the primary role of CDPs is to establish \"place\" data for communities located in unincorporated areas, a CDP cannot be within an incorporated place. Since the Census Bureau recognizes New England cities as incorporated places, a CDP cannot be within a city.\n\nData users from outside New England should be aware that New Englanders usually think in terms of entire towns (i.e., MCD data), making CDP data of marginal local interest. Since virtually all territory in New England outside of Maine is incorporated, CDPs do not really serve the same purpose as they do elsewhere; CDPs in New England invariably represent territory that is not \"unincorporated\", but part of a larger incorporated town. The extent to which such an area has its own distinct identity can vary, but is not usually as strong as identification with the town as a whole. There are numerous instances where the Census Bureau recognizes the built-up area around a town center as a CDP, resulting in a CDP that bears the same name as the town. In these cases, data for the CDP is, in general, meaningless to local residents, who seldom draw any particular distinction between the built-up area around the town center and outlying areas of the town. A local source citing data for such a community will almost always use the data for the entire town, not the CDP.\n\nAt the same time, not all built-up places with significant populations are recognized as CDPs. The Census Bureau has historically recognized relatively few CDPs within urbanized areas in particular. Many towns located in such areas do not contain any recognized CDPs and will thus be completely absent from Census materials presenting the population of \"places\". Greenwich, Connecticut, is one prominent example. While the Town of Greenwich appears in MCD materials, the Census Bureau does not recognize Greenwich as a \"place\".\n\nIn New Hampshire and Vermont, the Census Bureau treats each individual unorganized entity (township, gore, grant, etc.) as an MCD. In Maine, it seems, due to the extent of unorganized area, the Census Bureau typically lumps contiguous townships, gores, and the like together into larger units called \"unorganized territories\" (UTs), which are then treated as MCDs. In a few cases in Maine where a township or gore does not border any other unorganized land, it is treated as its own MCD rather than being folded into a larger UT.\n\nIn theory, a CDP could probably be defined within an MCD representing an unorganized area. Due to the extremely sparse population in most such areas, however, there are few if any cases in which the Census Bureau has actually done so.\n\nFor a list of all New England towns and other town-level municipalities, see the following articles:\n\nNote: All population statistics are from the 2020 United States census.\n\nConnecticut contains 169 incorporated towns. Put into terms that are equivalent to the other New England states, 20 are cities/boroughs and 149 are towns. (As discussed in the Cities section of Other types of municipalities in New England above, the relationship between towns and cities in Connecticut is different from the other New England states, at least on paper; thus, in the technical sense, all 169 of the above municipalities are really towns, with 20 overlaid by a coextensive city or borough of the same name.)[14] Together, these 169 municipalities cover the entire state. There is no unincorporated territory, but, as in all New England states, there are a fair number of unincorporated, named communities that lie within the incorporated territory of a municipality.\n\nConnecticut is one of two New England states to have any type of incorporated general-purpose municipality below the town level, namely incorporated boroughs (Vermont has incorporated villages). There are nine remaining in the state, with one, Naugatuck, having consolidated with the town. Additionally, the US Census Bureau treats Groton Long Point as a borough, as an act of the state legislature gives it the same powers as a borough, although it has never formally organized as one. They were once more numerous.[15] Many of those that remain are very small. Connecticut also has at least one remaining city (Groton) that is within, but not coextensive with, its parent town. A second non-coextensive city, Winsted, still exists on paper, but its government has been consolidated with that of the town of Winchester for many years, making it more of a special-purpose district than a true municipality. Winsted is no longer recognized by the Census Bureau as an incorporated place, although data is tabulated for a Census Designated Place that is coextensive with that of the original city.\n\nAs of the 2020 census, Maine contains 485 organized municipalities, of which 23 are incorporated as cities, 430 are incorporated as towns, and the remaining 32 are organized as plantations. These 485 organized municipalities together cover much of, but not all of, the state's territory. Of Maine's sixteen counties, only four are entirely incorporated. Four other counties are almost entirely incorporated, but include small amounts of unincorporated/unorganized territory (three of these four counties were entirely incorporated or organized at one time, but lost that status when a town disincorporated or a plantation surrendered its organization). The remaining eight counties contain significant amounts of unincorporated/unorganized territory. Most of these areas are in very sparsely populated regions, however. Only about 1.3% of the state's population lives in areas not part of a town, city, or plantation.\n\n(Since the 2000 Census, two towns, Madrid and Centerville, have disincorporated. Thus, at the time of the 2000 Census, Maine had 22 cities, 434 towns, and 34 plantations, for a total of 490 organized municipalities. Also since the 2010 Census, Sanford adopted a new charter that included designation as a city.)\n\nMassachusetts contains 351 municipal corporations, consisting of cities and towns. These 351 municipalities together encompass the entire territory of Massachusetts; there is no area that is outside the bounds of a municipality. Using usual American terminology, there is no \"unincorporated\" land in Massachusetts.\n\nOf the 351 municipalities, the number that are cities and the number that are towns is a matter of some ambiguity. Depending on which source is consulted, anywhere from 39 to 53 are cities. The ambiguity is the result of questions around the legal status of municipalities that have since the 1970s, through home-rule petition, adopted corporate charters approved by the state legislature with forms of government that resemble city government and do not include elements traditionally associated with town government (especially, a board of selectmen and a town meeting). Of the fourteen communities that have done so, all but three call themselves a \"town\" in their municipal operations, and are usually referred to by residents as \"towns\", but the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth's Office considers all fourteen to be legally cities. Other sources within state government often refer to all fourteen municipalities as towns, however. The U.S. Census Bureau listed all as towns through the 1990 Census. For the 2000 Census, some were listed by the Federal government as towns and some as cities, a situation that continues in Census materials since 2000. Massachusetts appears to be the only New England state where this issue has arisen, though other New England states also have municipalities that have adopted what amounts to city forms of government but continue to call themselves \"towns\". In the other New England states, it does not appear that any need to officially label such municipalities as \"cities\" has been identified.\n\nFor purposes of determining the \"largest town\" and \"smallest city\", in this article, only the 42 municipalities that title themselves as cities are recognized as cities. This includes the 39 cities that adopted city forms of government through pre-home rule procedures. The other 309 municipalities in the state are treated as towns below. The same classification is used for identifying Massachusetts cities on the list of New England towns and its attendant pages with historical census population statistics.\n\nFor further information, see this section of Massachusetts government.[16][17][18]\n\nNew Hampshire contains 234 incorporated towns and cities. Thirteen are cities and 221 are towns. These 234 municipalities together cover the vast majority of, but not all of, the state's territory. There are some unincorporated areas in the sparsely populated northern region of the state. Most of the unincorporated areas are in Coos County, the state's northernmost county. Carroll and Grafton counties also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory. This territory includes seven unincorporated townships and an assortment of gores, grants, purchases, and locations. The remaining seven counties in the state are entirely incorporated (Grafton County was also fully incorporated at one time, but lost that status when one of its towns disincorporated). Fewer than 250 of the state's residents live in unincorporated areas.\n\nRhode Island contains 39 incorporated towns and cities. Eight are cities and 31 are towns. These 39 municipalities together cover the entire state; there is no unincorporated territory.\n\nVermont contains 246 incorporated towns and cities, which together cover nearly all of the state's territory. Nine are cities and 237 are towns. There are some unincorporated areas in the sparsely populated mountainous regions of the state. Most of the unincorporated areas are in Essex County, in the northeastern part of the state. Bennington, Windham and Chittenden counties also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory. This territory includes five unincorporated townships and four gores and grants. The remaining ten counties in the state are entirely incorporated (Bennington and Windham counties were also fully incorporated at one time, but lost that status when a town disincorporated). Fewer than 100 of the state's residents live in unincorporated areas.\n\nVermont is one of two New England states to have any type of incorporated general-purpose municipality below the town level, namely incorporated villages (Connecticut has incorporated boroughs). There are 32 in the state. There were once nearly double that number.[20]",

    "title": "One developer used Claude to build a memory-safe extension of C",
    "description": "feature: Robin Rowe talks about coding, programming education, and China in the age of AI",
    "fullText": "feature TrapC, a memory-safe version of the C programming language, is almost ready for testing.\n\n\"We're almost there,\" Robin Rowe told The Register in a phone interview. \"It almost works.\"\n\nWe caught up with Rowe, a computer science professor and entrepreneur, amid debugging efforts that had kept him up until four in the morning. The long-awaited TrapC website has appeared.\n\n\"My work building TrapC has taken two parallel paths,\" Rowe explains in his initial post. \"A TrapC interpreter called itrapc and a separate compiler called trapc. I had wanted to make a software release by 1 January 2026, but too many bugs. I only reached code complete this month and am now on the painstaking and sleepless process of debugging. When I have something stable that mostly works I will make a release. Sorry to make you wait a little longer. Aiming for Q1 2026.\"\n\nBack in November 2024, Rowe explained that he was working on TrapC. At the time, the public and private sector had undertaken a campaign to promote memory-safe software development as a way to reduce exposure to serious vulnerabilities.\n\nMemory safety provides a way of ensuring that memory-related bugs like out-of-bounds reads/writes and use-after-free don't happen. In large codebases, like Chromium and Windows, most of the security vulnerabilities follow from memory bugs. As that message has been repeated in recent years, memory safety has become an imperative, evangelized by the likes of Google and Microsoft, and more recently by authorities in the US and elsewhere.\n\nFor at least the past ten years, there's been a rising chorus of voices calling for the adoption of memory-safe programming languages and techniques. This has meant encouraging developers to avoid languages like C and C++ where feasible, and to adopt languages like C#, Go, Java, Python, Swift, and Rust, instead, particularly for new projects.\n\nTo remain relevant, the C and C++ communities have tried to address those concerns with projects like TrapC, FilC, Mini-C, Safe C++, and C++ Profiles. There's also a C to Rust conversion project under development at DARPA called TRACTOR – TRanslating All C TO Rust.\n\nBut progress has been slow and those writing in C and C++ haven't found a widely accepted approach. The C++ standards committee recently rejected the Safe C++ proposal. And Rowe said he doubted TRACTOR would have anything to show this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the clock is ticking. Microsoft engineer Galen Hunt last month said, \"My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI and algorithms to rewrite Microsoft's largest codebases.\"\n\n\"There are some efforts to port C code by hand to Rust,\" said Rowe. \"But there're some real challenges to doing that because there are some idioms in C that cannot be expressed in Rust.\n\n\"Rust is much more type safe than C is. And so if you have a void pointer, what does that mean in Rust? There's no translation for it. And that's how TrapC is fundamentally different because it actually remembers what that void pointer actually is.\"\n\nRowe said he expects TRACTOR will eventually be able to accomplish C to Rust translation using AI. But he said he thinks it's better to just build the necessary tooling into the C compiler, so you don't have to rely on some external tool that rewrites your code in an unfamiliar language.\n\nRowe has been using AI tools himself and has been teaching others to do so. This past semester, he taught AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst (PCO471) at Community College of Baltimore County – Linux administration using vibe coding in bash with no prerequisites. And starting in February, he's teaching C++ Programming with Generative AI (PCO472) – vibe coding in C++.\n\nRowe said programming has fundamentally changed as a result of AI tools. \"I think this is sort of the same type of discussion as when C came in and people said, 'Well, I'm happy in assembly.' There will still be people doing it the old way. But because vibe programming is so much more efficient on time when done correctly, there's gonna be no choice. You just won't be competitive if you're not vibe programming.\"\n\nThen he shifted gears, slightly. \"But I have to walk that back a little bit because the reason I was up until four in the morning is I had vibe programming working on the Trap C compiler. And it took a fundamentally wrong design turn. And I didn't detect that it had made a design mistake. I had told it how I wanted to approach it. But somehow it misunderstood me or it forgot or something happened and I forgot to check. And so I spent hours doodling around in the debugger and trying to understand why code was acting weird before I finally looked at it and said, 'wait a minute, this isn't even the right design.'\"\n\nRowe said a similar situation crops up in pair programming, where you've told someone to do something and they didn't do it, and you don't realize that until later.\n\n\"[C++ creator] Bjarne Stroustrup famously said that the most important thing in software design is to be clear about what you're trying to build,\" Rowe said. \"And vibe [programming] just puts that on steroids. Now we not only have to be ourselves clear, but we have to communicate it clearly to an LLM.\"\n\nRowe argues that developers have to be encouraged to try AI tools and to make mistakes. He recounted how during his AI Cybersecurity Programmer Analyst course, his students expressed interest in doing more hands-on work in lieu of lectures.\n\n\"So I said, 'I've got real servers on the internet that are my companies. I'll give you root,'\" he recalled. \"I'll set loose students who know nothing on my own servers and hope for the best and we'll see how this goes. And the reaction was panic. I couldn't get past the timidity cliff.\"\n\nRowe said that what he learned from that exchange was that they didn't want their own hands-on, they wanted to watch him work.\n\n\"I said to them, 'But guys, this is like learning to play the piano. You can't learn to play the piano by watching me. Yeah, you guys have to practice. And it's gonna be embarrassing at first. You know, you're gonna play a lot of bad notes and sound terrible. You have to get over that situation'.\"\n\nThat's a scenario playing out in various companies where AI tools remain underutilized, for various reasons, including lack of training, security concerns, lack of utility, and poor tool design.\n\nRowe has traveled often to China to speak at the China Association of Higher Education conference. In December, he said, he was interviewed on China News Television about how China's plan for AI compares with America's.\n\nIn an email he explained, \"I said, 'China's AI-Plus plan calls for efficient AI on devices everywhere, from farm to factory to city, while the White House plan calls for building 500-billion-dollar cloud data centers ... using chips that will, inevitably, seem obsolete within two years.'\"\n\nRowe argues China's approach will prevail and that the US has taken the wrong turn by focusing on centralized cloud datacenters to run LLMs. Within two years, he said, we'll have AI models we can run locally on our phones, with no need for network access for most tasks. Apple and Huawei, he said, are likely to be the winners in this scenario.\n\nRowe pointed to China's DeepSeek as an example. While it may not be quite as good as the leading US commercial models, he said, it runs with far less power.\n\n\"This is a very Moore's Law type of strategy,\" he said. \"I remember when I had a Navy supercomputer in 1994. That was an amazing technology. But in 1995, Cray went bankrupt. There weren't enough buyers for it, even though it was an amazing device.\n\n\"And now I've got an iPhone that's in my pocket. That runs on a battery. It doesn't have a whole room devoted to it and exotic cooling and all kinds of stuff. And it's more powerful than that [the Cray from 1994]. So as a long-term strategy, you know, going toward the device makes a lot more sense, because that half-trillion dollar data center is going to be on my iPhone eventually.\"\n\nRowe also said that on the recommendation of a friend from his time at the AT&T DIRECTV Innovation Lab, he tried running Deepseek at a time when Claude wasn't available. Deepseek, he said, was able to find a bug that Claude couldn't.\n\n\"Surprisingly, the bug was in code Claude had generated, that I had cut-and-pasted carelessly,\" he said. \"With hindsight it was a silly code mistake I should have caught, but was in an 'else' branch outside where I was looking. I'd not expected or intended to have Claude make any change to that block of code. And because the code was valid but the logic wrong, the compiler didn't catch it.\"\n\nBut the bug was obvious, he said, as soon as Deepseek pointed it out. He added, \"I'm paying $200/year for Claude. Deepseek is free.\" ®",

    "description": "If you do these five things, you will win with money 100% of the time, says Dave Ramsey. To do so: Have a written plan (a budget). Get out of debt. Live on less than you make. Save and invest.",
    "fullText": "Ramsey’s debt snowball method targets smallest balances first to free up cash for larger debts.\n\nTraditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.\n\nCharitable donations can be tax deductible and help reduce overall tax bills.\n\nInvestors rethink ‘hands off’ investing and decide to start making real money\n\nIf you do these five things, you will win with money 100% of the time, says Dave Ramsey.\n\nHave a written plan (a budget).\n\nThat includes current income sources, such as Social Security, pensions, investments, and retirement plans. It should also include projected expenses such as taxes, and money set aside for unexpected events, as compared to expected income numbers.\n\nAs you near retirement, “begin with the end in mind,” as noted by Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\n\nThat includes the consideration of how much you need to spend every year on rent or mortgage unless you’re one of the lucky ones who have paid off your mortgage, healthcare and long-term costs, groceries, medication, transportation costs, and perhaps even pet expenses. Plus, do you expect to travel a lot, and how much do you foresee spending? Maybe you have plans to help your children, and even their children with things such as college tuition.\n\nFor many of us, getting out of debt is easier said than done.\n\nAccording to Dave Ramsey, focus on the smaller balances first. That way, you free up even more cash for the heavier debt. Then, once the smaller debts are paid off, you now have new cash flow to tackle to make extra payments on higher interest balances.\n\nThen, as noted by Ramsey Solutions, “Make minimum payments on all debts except the smallest—throwing as much money as you can at that one. Once that debt is gone, take its payment and apply it to the next smallest debt (while continuing to make minimum payments on your other debts).”\n\nThen, repeat that over and over again until you drive down your overall debt.\n\nOr, you could make just minimum payments on all of your debt and put a chunk into the expense with the most interest. Or three, you could take out a consolidation loan, wipe out all of the outstanding debt, and have one balance. Not only could this allow you to manage your debt a bit better, but it may also allow you to put extra funds into an emergency account.\n\nDave Ramsey believes living on less than you make is crucial for achieving wealth.",

    "fullText": "When Pensacola-area buyer Chelsea Hoffman took delivery of her brand-new 2026 Cadillac Escalade late in 2025, she expected Rolls-Royce-level service, showroom shine, and that unmistakable Monroney window sticker outlining every option and dollar spent.\n\nInstead, what she got was confusion and a cautionary tale for the rest of us about transparency, compliance, and consumer protection in today’s high-stakes luxury car market. Hoffman documented her stories in a series of now-deleted TikTok videos, leaving followers wondering why she took down the videos.\n\nWhat seemed like a clerical oversight quickly snowballed into something much bigger. Hoffman was handed a brand-new Escalade — a six-figure purchase — and noticed there was no window sticker attached to the car at delivery. Instead, only a transport sticker marked “not for sale” was present.\n\nThat’s unusual. Under the Automobile Information Disclosure Act of 1958, every new vehicle sold in the U.S. must display a Monroney window sticker showing MSRP, options, and destination charges before sale completion.\n\nFor luxury vehicles like the Escalade, where a set of wheels or a trim package can tack tens of thousands of dollars onto the price, the sticker isn’t just “that paper on the glass” — it’s proof of exactly what the customer agreed to buy.\n\nHoffman asked for the original window sticker at least seven times, repeatedly reaching out directly to General Motors for documentation. But instead of getting the original manufacturer-issued sticker tied to her VIN, she was told that the dealer had modified the sticker after the sale. GM representatives confirmed this claim in writing during her case with BBB Auto Line.\n\nThat’s where the plot thickens.\n\nFor many car buyers, the window sticker is an afterthought, which seems like exactly what the dealer was counting on — “something in the binder” — but Hoffman’s experience highlights why it matters:\n\nIt’s legally mandated: Dealers must display it before sale. Its absence at delivery signals a breakdown in seller transparency.\n\nIt’s a record of build and options: With luxury vehicles, buyers carefully weigh advanced packages and high-cost upgrades. A mismatch between listed and actual features can mean thousands of dollars of unaccounted value.\n\nIt’s central in disputes: Lemon law and buyback cases hinge on documented discrepancies in vehicle configuration and performance claims.\n\nSo, while replacement window stickers can be reprinted under limited circumstances (for damage or loss in transit), altering original equipment descriptions after the sale raises compliance concerns and potentially misleads customers.\n\nSticker drama was just the beginning of Hoffman’s ordeal. Within weeks of receiving the Escalade, she experienced ongoing engine issues that saw the vehicle in and out of the dealership with limited resolution, an experience no new-car buyer would wish on anyone.\n\nRepeated repairs without a clear fix pushed her toward invoking Florida’s lemon law protections, which allow consumers to seek repurchase if a significant defect persists after reasonable repair attempts. After escalation through arbitration, Hoffman says GM agreed to a buyback, though she expressed concerns about the clarity of the settlement terms.\n\nInterestingly, this isn’t an isolated issue in the Escalade world. Owners have reported engine failures, including catastrophic mechanical breakdowns, chains of repeated repairs, and manufacturer resistance to recalls when engines fail prematurely.\n\nDocument Everything Before Signing\nBuyers should photograph the window sticker before signing final paperwork. This preserves a snapshot of the vehicle’s factory build and price.\n\nKnow Your Rights\nLemon laws vary by state, but persistent defects paired with documentation gaps can strengthen a buyer’s case if pursued through arbitration or legal channels.\n\nDealers Must Maintain Compliance and Transparency\nMissing or modified stickers are more than bookkeeping errors as they can undermine trust and expose dealers to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThese days that digital contracts and online sales processes are the norm, Hoffman’s story is a powerful jolt to the reality that a window sticker is proof of promise. And when that promise goes missing, the road ahead, as Hoffman found out, can get very bumpy.",

Much of the region experienced that level or more.\n\nThe weather service released accumulation amounts that include:\n\n“There is widespread damage across the area in the form of trees and power poles broken and down, power outages, and dangerous travel,” National Weather Service meteorologist Alyssa Clements said. “That's the kind of damage that occurs with accumulations of over half an inch of ice – which we had numerous reports of.”\n\nOther areas in the region with high ice accumulation reports include:\n\nNortheast Red Boiling Springs: 0.60.\n\nNashville and Berry Hill: 0.50.\n\nGrundy County (Beersheba Springs): 0.56.\n\nLawrence County: (Ethridge): 0.50.\n\nLewis County (Southeast Hohenwald): 0.50.\n\nMacon County (Southeast Lafayette): 0.50.\n\nRobertson County (Springfield): 0.50.\n\nRutherford County (Eagleville): 0.50.\n\nSumner County (Hendersonville): 0.50.\n\nMiddle Tennessee also had snowfall associated with the winter storm, mostly before the changeover to freezing rain and ice.\n\nMost areas of Middle Tennessee had 1-2 inches of snow. A portion of Montgomery County reported 4.3 inches, Stewart County 3.9 inches and Ashland City 3.1 inches.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: Brentwood, Gallatin?

    "description": "A car is expected to be a purchase that will last you for a long time, but Consumer Reports found that one brand ranked the worst in reliability.",
    "fullText": "Cars have never stopped evolving when it comes to powertrains, interior tech, safety features, and really, every other aspect that makes a car what it is. The auto industry is driven by this sense of innovation, and always has been.  But the last 10 years specifically have seen a massive change in the types of vehicles on the road – and also the problems that can arise from them.\n\nGasoline cars have grown more complex and more tech-laden with each model year, and more recently, they've been joined by a growing number of electric and plug-in-hybrid vehicles that bring with them their own set of both promises and potential problems. Further complicating things is the arrival of new brands on the market, with these startups often lacking the infrastructure and the legacy know-how when it comes to servicing. And that's exactly what brings us to Consumer Reports' most recent rankings for new car reliability, where electric truck and SUV maker Rivian finished dead last.\n\nRivian's R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck are technical marvels in many ways, with a high-tech mix of rugged truck capability and supercar-like performance, but are these reliability issues dealbreakers for the brand? This is where the story gets more complicated, not just because the problems themselves can vary widely in their severity, but also because there's hope that may just be growing pains as the EV startup works to grab a larger footing in the market.\n\nWhile Rivian's ranking at the bottom of the list is not a great development for the company, it's important to put things into context and look at what 'reliability' means when talking about a brand-new electric vehicle. Back in the '90s or 2000s, if a new car was considered 'unreliable,' it may have meant things like being stranded on the side of the road, a major mechanical failure, or other problems that could leave a car sitting in a dealer service department for weeks.\n\nIn some instances, it could be a relatively minor problem like an interior rattle, a software glitch, or any number of small issues that might be expected from a new model from a new company. There have, however, been some cases of extensive Rivian failures, including one R1S owner who needed to have his entire battery and drive units replaced – though he was very pleased with how Rivian's service center handled the issue.\n\nAnd that last part actually ties into something that puts Rivian's issues into a better context. Though the R1S and R1T might be considered some of the least reliable EV trucks on the market, Rivian owners are still generally very satisfied with their vehicles. Consumer Reports' rankings of owner satisfaction show Rivian in the number one spot, with 85% of owners saying they would buy one again. This suggests that overall, the reliability issues might not be as severe as the low ranking suggests.\n\nBeyond the strange inverse between Rivian's placement in CR's reliability and owner satisfaction ratings, there's a hope that Rivian's reliability issues are just growing pains for a company that's only been selling vehicles for a few years. Tesla, for example, has previously earned low reliability scores from Consumer Reports, but has improved significantly; Tesla currently sits at number nine in CR's rankings, ahead of brands like Ford and Chevrolet.\n\nThough it hasn't been smooth-sailing for Rivian financially, with lots of vehicles on the road with satisfied owners, the company still made it much further than most of the failed EV startups out there, many of which never even made it off the launchpad. The coming years are going to be crucial for Rivian as the company works to gain its financial footing, address these issues on the R1S and R1T, and also works on the rollout of its upcoming R3-series electric crossovers.\n\nRivian hopes the R3 and the mid-sized R2 will bring the same blend of style, tech, and capability from its large vehicles into the smaller, cheaper segments, but there's still a long way to go until then. Things have changed immensely in the EV world in the last couple of years, and it will be very interesting to see how Rivian navigates the uncertain waters of the late 2020s.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "Bertone plans to build just 25 examples of the stylish two-seater.",
    "fullText": "One of the great concepts of yesteryear is finally going into production.\n\nBertone has revealed plans to build not one, but two cars based on the Autobianchi A112 Runabout from 1969. The coachbuilder plans to release Barchetta and Targa models of the reimagined sports car and plans to build just 25 examples.\n\nA 30th-Floor Miami Beach Condo With a Rotating Bed Lists for $5.2 Million\n\nThis One-of-a-Kind Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X Just Hammered Down for $2.6 Million\n\nAn Ultra-Rare Porsche 911 Speedster Is Now up for Grabs\n\nThe A112 Runabout made its debut at the 1969 Turin Auto Show in October. The striking prototype, which was designed by Bertone’s legendary Marcello Gandini, was a small barchetta that shared a transverse mid-engine layout with the designer’s more famous Lamborghini Miura. The tiny two-door was imagined as a replacement for the Fiat 850 Spider, which the coachbuilder had been manufacturing for the Italian automaker. But, as used to be the norm for most concepts, the vehicle never made it to production, and instead became one of the great Italian automotive “What ifs” of the last century.\n\nNow, nearly 60 years later, Bertone has decided to finally put the car into production itself. The new Roundabout isn’t a faithful recreation of the original concept; it’s a spirited reinterpretation. Its wedge-shaped, carbon-fiber body, which, Motor1.com points out, is about the same size as a Mazda Miata, is even more sleek than its predecessor and features pop-up headlights. But the biggest change is that the Targa version will include removable roof panels. The cabin has a distinct retro feel—including plenty of physical controls—but still features a digital gauge display in the cockpit.\n\nThe Runabout is built on a modified Lotus chassis, according to Top Gear. It is powered by a Toyota-sourced 3.5-liter supercharged V-6 mated to a six-speed manual gearbox—yes, it’s a stick shift—that makes 475 hp and 361 ft lbs of torque. Bertone says it will be able to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 168 mph, numbers that easily best what the concept would have been capable of had it made it to production.\n\nAre you in the market for a stylish two-seater? You might want to reach out to Bertone quickly if you want to reserve a Runabout. Just prepare to spend. Each of the 25 examples, whether its the Barchetta or Targa model, will cost €390,000, which works out to $463,000.\n\nClick here for more photos of the Bertone Runabout.\n\nThe 2024 Chevy C8 Corvette: Everything We Know About the Powerful Mid-Engine Beast\n\nThe World’s Best Superyacht Shipyards",

    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - India and the European Union have concluded negotiations on a long-coveted trade deal that will be announced on Tuesday, the South Asian nation's trade secretary said on Monday, an ​accord both sides hailed as historic as they contend with strained U.S. ties.\n\nThe deal paves the way ‌for free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European nations and India, which together make up a quarter of the world's gross ‌domestic product and a market of 2 billion consumers.\n\n\"It will be a balanced, forward-looking deal for better economic integration with the EU. The deal will propel trade and investment between both sides,\" said India Trade Secretary Rajesh Agrawal.\n\nTrade between the two sides stood at $136.5 billion in the fiscal year through March 2025.\n\nThe formal signing would take place after legal ⁠vetting expected to last five to six ‌months, an Indian government official aware of the matter said.\n\n\"We expect the deal to be implemented within a year,” the official added.\n\nThe agreement comes days after the EU signed a pivotal ‍pact with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.\n\nDuring the same period, New Delhi finalised agreements with Britain, New Zealand and Oman.\n\nThe spate of deals underscores global efforts to hedge against the United States as President Donald ​Trump's bid to take over Greenland and tariff threats on European countries test longstanding alliances among Western nations.\n\nAfter ‌nearly two decades of on-off negotiations, the deal will see India open up its vast and guarded market, the world's largest, to free trade with the EU, its biggest trading partner.\n\nFAST-TRACK TALKS AGREED LAST YEAR\n\nIndia and the EU pushed to close the deal after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to fast-track negotiations last year.\n\nTwo-way talks, relaunched in 2022 after a nine-year lull, gathered momentum after Trump imposed import tariffs on several ⁠trading partners, including a 50% tariff on goods from India.\n\nAn India-U.S. ​trade deal collapsed last year after a breakdown in communication between their ​two governments.\n\nBoth the EU and India had been locked in last-minute give and take over cars and steel trade, among the final points of contention.\n\nThe EU had sought sharp cuts by India ‍in import duties on its ⁠cars that can exceed 100%, while India - a major steel producer - has been pushing the EU to reduce trade curbs to its steel exports.",

    "description": "The SDHSAA board approved school enrollment numbers and heard classification appeals from schools.",
    "fullText": "PIERRE — Every two years, the South Dakota High School Activities Association approves school enrollment numbers that determine sports and fine arts classifications. Prior to that approval, the board may hear appeals from member schools.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026, the board heard nine appeals, approving six of them.\n\nAn appeal from Parkston High School was approved to discount one Hutterite student whose religious beliefs don’t allow him to participate in sports. Subtracting that one student allowed Parkston to stay in Class B.\n\nAn appeal to discount two students was approved for the Eureka/Edmunds Central cooperative. School officials explained that one student was not allowed in the building because of violence and safety reasons, and another student had lost his eligibility to play high school sports.\n\nCOLUMN: Make It Official: I've Gone Batty!\n\nSisseton had two appeals approved. One was to discount students who had lost eligibility. The other appeal was to allow the school to go from 11-man football to 9AA. Sisseton Superintendent Tammy Meyer said she realized that moving down in classification would mean that the Sisseton football team could not compete in the playoffs.\n\n“Our intention would be to go back to 11-man in the next cycle,” Meyer said, referring to the two-year classification system.\n\nAn appeal from the Flandreau Indian School, which has 10 students who have lost eligibility, was approved.\n\nThe board had a lengthy discussion about the appeal from Hamlin High School which traditionally asks for an exemption for students who are members of the Apostolic Church. Those students are prohibited by their church affiliation from taking part in extracurricular activities.\n\nBoard member Billy Clanton of Harding County School District questioned the procedure for determining which students belong to the Apostolic religion and then allowing them to be exempted from the school's enrollment count. Superintendent Jim Hulscher said the school relies on information from board members and staffers who are members of the Apostolic religion.\n\nClanton made a motion to deny the appeal. That failed on a vote of 1-8. A motion to approve the appeal succeeded on an 8-1 vote.\n\nThe board also approved an appeal from De Smet High School, allowing the school to discount four students of the Apostolic religion.\n\nThe board denied a request from Mount Vernon/Plankinton cooperative. School officials representing the cooperative said their enrollment fluctuated as students dropped out of school during the year to go to work. The board denied the request as there was no precedent in association policy.\n\nA request from Douglas High School was also denied. High school principal Beau Voegeli said the school had a tough time competing at its current classification in football because of the transient nature of families living on the nearby Air Force base.\n\nThe school asked to go from 11AA football to 11A and retain its ability to compete in the postseason.\n\nSDHSAA Executive Director Dan Swartos said there are plenty of teams that could make the same argument about not being competitive. He said the association has a committee looking at a way to determine classifications based on a success factor.\n\nSioux Falls Lutheran High School used its appeal to seek a move down in a football classification. Activities director James Stubkjaer said the high school football program was built from scratch and that the players suffered since they didn’t have the background in the sport that would come from having middle school and junior varsity programs.\n\nThe appeal was denied by the board.\n\nLater in the meeting, the board approved each school’s enrollment or average daily membership. Here are the ways that the classifications break down for sports and fine arts.\n\n11AAA — Eight largest schools, plus O’Gorman\n\n11B — All remaining schools with ADM of 56.001 and above\n\n9AA — The top one-third of all schools with ADM of 56 and below\n\n9A — The middle one-third of all schools with ADM of 56.000 and below\n\n9B — The bottom one-third of all schools with ADM of 56.000 and below\n\nCOLUMN: Column about writer having another encounter with a bat named DONALD four years later\n\nDivide the total number of teams competing based on ADM equally, with the odd number moving up to Class AA\n\nSchools petitioning to go up in class in sports for 2026-27 and 2027-28 school years include:\n\nFootball — O’Gorman (11AA to 11AAA)\n\nGolf — Aberdeen Roncalli (Boys), Groton Area, Parkston, Redfield, Tiospa Zina (B to A)\n\nSoccer — Sioux Falls Christian (Boys) (A to AA)\n\nTennis — Sioux Falls Christian (A to AA)\n\nWrestling — Chamberlain, Milbank (B to A)\n\n725 Students and above-five quartets\n\n575 to 724.999 students-four quartets\n\n425 to 574.999 students-three quartets\n\n125 to 424.999 students-two quartets\n\nClass AA — Top 14 teams, plus those opting up\n\nClass A — All remaining schools\n\nSchools petitioning up in fine arts activities for 2026-27 and 2027-28 include:\n\n• Debate — Huron, O’Gorman (A to AA)\n\nFollow Watertown Public Opinion sports reporter Roger Merriam on X (formerly known as Twitter) @PO_Sports or email: rmerriam@thepublicopinion.com\n\nThis article originally appeared on Watertown Public Opinion: S.D.

    "fullText": "Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday backed a proposed fan boycott of World Cup matches in the United States because of the conduct of President Donald Trump and his administration at home and abroad.\n\nBlatter was the latest international soccer figure to call into question the suitability of the United States as a host country. He called for the boycott in a post on X that supported Mark Pieth's comments in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund.\n\nPieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago. Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.\n\nIn his interview with Der Bund, Pieth said, “If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”\n\nIn his X post, Blatter quoted Pietha and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”\n\nThe United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.\n\nThe international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protestors in American cities, particularly Minneapolis.\n\nOke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.\n\nFans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

You’ve worked your whole life and saved up as much as you could, but you’re still feeling the compulsion to keep at it even though you’ve reached your financial goals.\n\nIf that’s the case, you may be suffering from “just one more year” syndrome.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nAfter working a minimum of 40-hours a week for years, the thought of all that freedom is enticing, but also worrying. Just what exactly are you supposed to spend your time on? What’s more, the pressure-cooker at work is where many of your friends are, and a key part of your social network. Then there’s the financial piece of the puzzle.\n\nSo, what exactly is “just one more year” syndrome? And more importantly, what is the cure?\n\nLet’s say a healthy 60-year-old woman has hit her $1.5 million retirement savings target — already well above the “magic number” of $1.26 million many Americans believe they’ll need to retire, according to Northwestern Mutual (1) — and she is ready to quit her high-paying and extremely stressful job.\n\nBut she’s still hesitating. After all, one more year of work means one more year of retirement savings. Plus, she can’t claim Medicare until 65, and if she takes her Social Security benefit at age 62, she’ll have to take a reduced benefit.\n\nAnd so, although she already has enough money to retire, she decides to work just one more year, which quickly turns into another year, and then another.\n\nSoon enough, she is suffering from “just one more year” syndrome.\n\nNow that we know what it is, let’s look at the cure.\n\nA good place to start is managing your expectations. According to Morgan Housel, the bestselling author of books like The Psychology of Money, “the hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.” In other words, financing a secure retirement is about recognizing when “enough is enough.”",

    "description": "Using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope in a patch of the sky covering almost three times the area of the full moon, scientists have",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Using observations from the James Webb Space Telescope in a patch of the sky covering almost three times the area of the full moon, scientists have created the most detailed cosmic map to date of the mysterious substance called dark matter that ​accounts for most of the stuff that populates the universe.\n\nOrdinary matter makes up stars, planets, people and everything else we can see. But it represents ‌only about 15% of all the matter in the cosmos. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or reflect light, making it invisible to the human eye and to telescopes.\n\nScientists infer its existence based ‌on the gravitational effects it exerts on a large scale such as how quickly galaxies rotate, how galaxy clusters are held together and how light from distant objects bends as it passes through massive cosmic structures.\n\nThe new map of the distribution of dark matter was based on this phenomenon of light bending - causing subtle distortions in the shape of roughly 250,000 distant galaxies as observed by Webb - thanks to the gravitational effects of matter along the line of sight.\n\nA previous map of dark matter was based on observations by the Hubble ⁠Space Telescope. The new map, powered by Webb's greater capabilities, ‌offers double the resolution of the previous map, spans more parts of the cosmos and peers further back in time - effectively looking to roughly 8 to 10 billion years ago, a key period for galaxy formation.\n\n\"This allows us to resolve finer dark matter structures, detect ‍mass concentrations that were previously unseen, and extend dark-matter mapping into earlier epochs of the universe,\" said observational cosmologist Diana Scognamiglio of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, lead author of the research published on Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nThe map reveals with unprecedented clarity new details of the macrostructure of the universe called the cosmic web - galaxy clusters, immense filaments built of dark ​matter along which galaxies and gas are distributed, as well as regions with less density of mass.\n\nWebb, an infrared telescope possessing about six times the light-gathering power of ‌Hubble, was launched in 2021 and became operational in 2022.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope is like putting on a new pair of glasses for the universe,\" Scognamiglio said. \"It sees fainter and more distant galaxies with much sharper detail than ever before. That effectively gives us a much denser grid of background galaxies to work with, which is exactly what you want for this kind of study. More galaxies and sharper images translate directly into a sharper map of dark matter.\"\n\nThe map covers a part of the sky called the Cosmic Evolution Survey, or COSMOS, located in the direction of the constellation Sextans. The map will facilitate future investigations of the universe in numerous ways, the researchers said.\n\n\"For example, ⁠a major question in astrophysics is how galaxies grow and evolve with time - how the universe went from an ​almost perfectly homogenous soup to the spectacular variety of galaxies we see today,\" said observational cosmologist and ​study co-author Jacqueline McCleary of Northeastern University in Boston.\n\n\"Dark matter halos - self-gravitating 'clouds' of dark matter - are the site of galaxy formation, the nurseries of galaxies, if you will. So knowing where the dark matter is, how much of it there is and connecting it to the population of galaxies inside ‍the dark matter distribution places an important boundary ⁠condition on models of galaxy formation and evolution,\" McCleary said.\n\nThe method used by the researchers involving the bending of light revealed the distribution of dark and ordinary matter.\n\nThe researchers said their observations are in harmony with the leading cosmological model - called Lambda-CDM, or cold dark matter - that explains the universe's beginning with the ⁠Big Bang and its subsequent evolution and structure. The model sees a universe dominated by dark matter and the invisible cosmic force called dark energy that is responsible for its accelerating expansion.\n\n\"In this framework, ‌dark matter provides the gravitational backbone on which galaxies, groups and clusters form, creating the large-scale cosmic web. Our map provides a much sharper observational ‌view of this dark-matter scaffolding,\" Scognamiglio said.",

You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nThe Trump Administration has reportedly proposed keeping reimbursement rates for Medicare plans almost flat year-over-year, much to the detriment of already slammed health insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS Health, and the like.\n\nThe proposal, first reported in WSJ this evening, says that payments will increase by an average rate of \"0.09%\" in 2027. The reaction after hours has been stark. On news of the report, the aforementioned three firms --- among the largest Medicare Advantage providers --- fell 8.8%, 12.8%, and 9.5% after the bell.\n\nAlthough over half of U.S. equities were in decline today, large caps kept the market on track. The Dow (+0.64%), S&P 500(+0.50%), and Nasdaq (+0.43%) continued a four day winning streak, while the Russell 2000 (-0.36%) suffered modest declines.\n\nTop of mind for most investors were forthcoming earnings and the Fed rate decision due out tomorrow. Earnings alone would have been a sufficient distraction this week, with reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and others. However, the Fed is also expected to release its rate decision tomorrow, adding to the busy state of affairs this week.\n\nThrough midday, things have taken a small turn. The Russell 2000 (-0.21%), once leading the pack is now the sole decliner among major indexes. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq (+0.71%) has pulled ahead.\n\nIn their fourth straight winning session, 56.1% (3,103) U.S. issues are now seen declining, but the 41.5% (2,293) lifting the market are putting up quite the fight.\n\nThat said, here are today's midday movers, our daily list of the top and bottom 20 stocks with at least a $2 billion market cap. Here, we aim to capture the biggest stories on markets\n\nUSA Rare Earth (+14.86%) is fetching a bid today after the U.S. government confirmed it would take a 10% stake in the business, making it today's best-performer.\n\nIt's joined by a handful of software companies; DigitalOcean (+12.27%), Pattern Group (+12.06%), Cloudflare (+10.74%), and Zoom Communications (+9.87%) are also putting up a strong performance today after a weak week for software stocks.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - India and China cut emissions from electricity generation by accelerating clean energy deployment, researchers say, offsetting growing coal use in the U.S. and capping global ​growth in pollutants linked to climate change.\n\nPower sector emissions by China and India, the world's ‌top coal users who accounted for 93% of the rise in carbon dioxide discharges in the decade through 2024, declined simultaneously for the ‌first time in 52 years, according to a report by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) this month.\n\n\"The fall in emissions in China and India in 2025 is a sign of things to come, as both countries added a record amount of new clean-power generation last year, which was more than sufficient to meet ⁠rising demand,\" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst ‌at CREA, an independent research group registered in Finland.\n\nCHINA, INDIA POWER EMISSIONS FALL\n\nChina's power sector emissions fell by 40 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), or 0.7% annually ‍in 2025, while discharges by Indian utilities declined 38 million tCO2e, or 4.1%, in the 11 months to the end of November, according to estimates from energy think-tank Ember compiled based on monthly government statistics.\n\nThat offset a 55.7 million metric tons ​of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) rise in annual U.S. emissions after an annual 13.1% increase in coal-fired power ‌output drove U.S. power plant emissions 3.3% higher in 2025, the fastest this century, the estimates showed, helping global emissions stay largely flat.\n\nPower plant emissions rose 3.4% in China and 4.4% in India annually on average over the 10 years to 2024, but fell 2.4% in the U.S. The three countries account for 60% of the world's power sector emissions, which make up about 35% of all polluting discharges linked to climate change.\n\nChina's ⁠coal use is set to decline gradually this decade, the ​International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its annual coal report in December, ​helping emissions from power generation plateau in the coming years.\n\nIn India, however, while record renewables additions and marginal growth in power demand helped New Delhi suppress coal use this ‍year, the IEA expects the ⁠country to continue depending on coal.\n\n\"Although coal-fired power generation declines in 2025, a moderate increase in coal consumption for power generation is nevertheless expected ... due to a steady rise in electricity demand,\" the ⁠IEA said.\n\nIn the U.S., the agency expects higher costs to reduce coal demand by 6% in the years until 2030 despite policy ‌incentives by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and a slowdown in coal plant closures.",

    "fullText": "Target employees are pushing the company to take a firmer stand against ICE.\n\nIn a letter emailed to management on Friday, employees called on Target to \"do the right thing\" and bar federal immigration authorities from its stores. The letter, viewed by Business Insider, was signed by 284 employees, many of whom said they were residents of Minnesota, where Target is headquartered.\n\n\"Target's continued inaction in the face of the current administration puts all of us at risk of more harm in our workplaces and represents a moral failure to protect those in our community,\" said the letter, which included current CEO Brian Cornell and incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke as recipients.\n\nA day after the letter was sent, federal agents shot and killed a second Minneapolis resident, Alex Pretti, further complicating tensions between protesters and the Trump administration.\n\nThe letter also highlights the January 7 death of Renee Good after her encounter with immigration authorities in Minneapolis. No charges have been filed in connection with Good's death, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has said there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the officer fired in self-defense, while Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has called for a transparent investigation.\n\nTarget has made several public moves since the letter was sent, including joining a statement with more than 60 other Minnesota businesses calling for de-escalation. Cornell also met with local faith leaders on Thursday to discuss the situation.\n\nOn Monday, Fiddelke sent a video message to staff that did not mention Trump or ICE by name, but said \"the violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful.\"\n\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer employs roughly 7,000 corporate employees at its headquarters offices, among its 440,000 employees across the US and around the world. The company also operates roughly 50 stores in the Twin Cities market.\n\nThe letter from employees highlighted Target's scaled-back LGBTQ+ Pride collection, its wind-down of certain DEI initiatives, and its donation to Donald Trump's inauguration fund as examples of how the company has \"abandoned its community\" in recent years.\n\nSome of the demands may be outside Target's legal ability to fully address, such as the calls on Target to block immigration authorities from its properties.\n\nCorporate immigration attorney John Medeiros told the AP last week that law enforcement officers are typically allowed to operate in publicly accessible areas of retail businesses, like parking lots and sales floors.\n\nGuidance from the Minnesota Attorney General's office says employees should not interfere with agents' lawful activities at their places of business, but neither are workers required to answer questions or tell agents whether a certain person is on the premises.\n\nIn a memo last week, chief HR officer Melissa Kremer said Target \"does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency.\"\n\nRead the full letter from employees here:\n\nHave a tip?

I felt like my value as a woman was diminishing. I felt very isolated,\" she said.\n\nBut her outlook has since shifted.\n\n\"Over time, now, I feel empowered and I'm going to talk about it and I'm not going to lose a thing,\" she said.\n\nUnion has previously spoken about her experience with menopause. In a 2023 interview with Allure, she said her hot flashes started when she was in her 40s.\n\n\"I'd wake up in the morning and it was like someone had poured a gallon of water on the bed,\" she said.\n\nUnion added that some of her menopause symptoms improved after she adopted an anti-inflammatory diet without gluten, dairy, alcohol, or caffeine.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Today with Jenna & Sheinelle\" in early January, Union recounted an incident where she experienced a hot flash during a star-studded media event.\n\n\"What do I do? In front of these people? All of the sudden I look up and Bad Bunny goes, 'Are you okay?' And I can't stop it. It's just coming down in sheets,\" Union said. \"Everyone starts handing me their napkins.\"\n\nOther celebrities have also shared their experiences with menopause.\n\nKatherine Heigl told Business Insider in July that it was challenging to go through perimenopause while parenting teenagers.\n\n\"Their hormones are all over the place, they're trying to adapt and get used to their new bodies and their new ways of thinking, and I am too. So the only thing I can do is look at them and go, 'Well, at least we're in it together,'\" she said.\n\nIn October, Naomi Watts told Business Insider that being diagnosed with perimenopause at 36 \"knocked me sideways.\" She said she experienced symptoms like night sweats and brain fog, which affected her career.\n\n\"Sometimes remembering lines becomes a lot harder,\" Watts said.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman is addressing AI's impact on the workforce, including on OpenAI's hiring practices.\n\nDuring a live-streamed town hall event on Monday, catered mainly toward developers, the OpenAI CEO said that AI has changed how quickly the company expands its head count, but the company is not in a hiring freeze and is nowhere close to doing away with human employees entirely.\n\n\"We are planning to dramatically slow down how quickly we grow because we think we'll be able to do so much more with fewer people,\" said Altman in response to a participant who asked if AI has changed OpenAI's interview process of potential candidates.\n\n\"What I think we shouldn't do, and what I hope other companies won't do either, is hire super aggressively, then realize all of a sudden AI can do a lot of stuff, and you need fewer people, and have to have some sort of very uncomfortable conversation,\" Altman added. \"So I think the right approach for us will be to hire more slowly but keep hiring.\"\n\nAltman's comments come amid the \"Great Freeze\" and concerns that job creation in America has lost momentum. The unemployment rate in November 2025 climbed to its highest level since 2021, while job openings have fallen 37% from their peak in 2022, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that, while in 2022 there were roughly two job openings for every unemployed worker, by September 2025 that ratio had fallen to one. Workers who have been jobless for at least 27 weeks also now make up about a quarter of all unemployed Americans.\n\nBased on data from the US Census Bureau, young workers have been hit especially hard by the hiring slowdown. The unemployment rate for Americans ages 20 to 24 reached 9.2% in August and September, the highest level since the recovery from the pandemic recession.",

    "title": "7 of the most interesting quotes from Anthropic CEO's sprawling 19,000-word essay about AI",
    "description": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei wrote that AI poses \"a serious civilizational challenge,\" one that will require society to take significant action.",
    "fullText": "Dario Amodei still has a lot to say.\n\nOn Monday, the Anthropic CEO dropped an over 19,000-word essay entitled \"The Adolescence of Technology\" on the future of AI on Monday, opining on everything from his fellow CEOs to feudalism, and even the Unabomber.\n\nBest known for his warning that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs in the next 1 to 5 years, Amodei has tangled with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and the Trump White House over his views.\n\nHere are seven of the most alarming and surprising quotes.\n\nAmodei remains optimistic about AI overall, but his essay detailed \"an intimidating gauntlet that humanity must run\" to reap the benefits of AI without letting the breakthrough technology destroy the world.\n\n\"I believe if we act decisively and carefully, the risks can be overcome — I would even say our odds are good. And there's a hugely better world on the other side of it,\" he wrote. \"But we need to understand that this is a serious civilizational challenge.\"\n\nAI development can't be stopped, Amodei wrote, a conclusion even some of AI's skeptics share. The financial and security benefits are just too massive for the private and public sectors to pass up.\n\nIt's why winning the AI race and doing so in an ethical way is so critical, he concludes.\n\nJensen Huang hasn't changed Amodei's mind on China.\n\n\"A number of complicated arguments are made to justify such sales, such as the idea that 'spreading our tech stack around the world' allows 'America to win' in some general, unspecified economic battle,\" Amodei said. \"In my view, this is like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and then bragging that the missile casings are made by Boeing and so the US is 'winning.'\"\n\nIn November, Nvidia announced a partnership with Anthropic that includes an investment of up to $10 billion in the AI startup. The news sparked speculation that tensions between Amodei and Huang might be cooling.\n\nWhatever the status of their relationship, Amodei is resolute that it is a horrendous decision to allow US companies to sell advanced chips to China.\n\n\"China is several years behind the US in their ability to produce frontier chips in quantity, and the critical period for building the country of geniuses in a data center is very likely to be within those next several years,\" Amodei wrote. \"There is no reason to give a giant boost to their AI industry during this critical period.\"\n\nAmodei would like his critics to see the scoreboard.\n\nAnthropic's leader hasn't tried to curry favor with the White House, nor has he vocally embraced President Donald Trump's AI policies to the same degree as his rival CEOs. Amodei's outspoken call for AI regulation even led David Sacks, Trump's AI czar, to publicly rebuke him.\n\nAnthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem. https://t.co/C5RuJbVi4P\n\nNone of it has changed Amodei's view that the AI industry \"needs a healthier relationship with government — one based on substantive policy engagement rather than political alignment.\"\n\n\"Many people have told me that we should stop doing this, that it could lead to unfavorable treatment, but in the year we've been doing it, Anthropic's valuation has increased by over 6x, an almost unprecedented jump at our commercial scale,\" he wrote.\n\nOf all of his hopes, this one appears the unlikeliest. Already, AI CEOs have formed dueling super PACs ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe tech elite made AI, and they should help society grapple with its fallout, he wrote in the essay. Amodei has long called on governments to prepare for mass job displacement. In one of the most eyebrow-raising parts of the essay, Anthropic CEO detailed what his fellow billionaires and companies must do.\n\nBeyond philanthropy, Amodei said companies need to be \"creative\" in how they stave off layoffs.\n\nIn the long term, he wrote, \"It may be feasible to pay human employees even long after they are no longer providing economic value in the traditional sense.\"\n\nOne of the biggest themes of Amodei's essay is the risk that AI companies themselves pose. It's a conclusion that he admits is \"somewhat awkward\" for him to reach. As an example, he points to the roiling topic of the sexualization of children. While he does not name xAI directly, Grok is facing investigations in multiple countries over the non-consensual sexualization of images of real people.\n\n\"Some AI companies have shown a disturbing negligence towards the sexualization of children in today's models, which makes me doubt that they'll show either the inclination or the ability to address autonomy risks in future models,\" he wrote.\n\nOverall, he expressed skepticism that AI companies will sacrifice profit for broader societal good. \"Ordinary corporate governance,\" Amodei wrote, is ill-equipped to address his worries.\n\nAmodei said that fears that AI models may defy orders and perhaps even try to eliminate humanity are complicated by bad actors in the industry who aren't as transparent about the risks they are seeing in their models.\n\n\"While it is incredibly valuable for individual AI companies to engage in good practices or become good at steering AI models, and to share their findings publicly, the reality is that not all AI companies do this, and the worst ones can still be a danger to everyone even if the best ones have excellent practices,\" he wrote.\n\nAmodei doesn't see the largest risks to humanity coming from AI pursuing total domination, but rather in what AI could enable humans to unleash.\n\nAmodei described his fears that AI is lowering the barrier of entry necessary to make killer biological weapons. His greatest concern is that AI could provide the step-by-step know-how that could eventually enable even an average person to produce a bioweapon.\n\nAI companies, Amodei said, need to ensure they create sufficient backstops to block such inquiries, including by making it difficult for hackers to jailbreak models. Adding such security is expensive, Amodei said, noting that these measures are \"close to 5% of total inference costs\" for some of the companies' models.\n\n\"I am concerned that over time there may be a prisoner's dilemma where companies can defect and lower their costs by removing classifiers,\" he wrote. \"This is once again a classic negative externalities problem that can't be solved by the voluntary actions of Anthropic or any other single company alone.\"\n\nAmodei is one of the AI industry's most vocal proponents of AI legislation. While Meta and Microsoft supported a federal preemption of state-level AI laws, Anthropic supported AI transparency bills in California and New York that are now law.\n\nThroughout the essay, Amodei outlined multiple areas for future legislation, including industry-wide transparency requirements like those at the state level. Even he concludes that new laws might not be enough.\n\n\"The rapid progress of AI may create situations that our existing legal frameworks are not well designed to deal with,\" he wrote.\n\nIt's why Amodei said he would go so far as to support a constitutional amendment. The US has not amended the Constitution since 1992, when the over two-century-long battle to add a limitation on congressional pay finally passed the 38th state legislature.\n\n\"I would support civil liberties-focused legislation (or maybe even a constitutional amendment) that imposes stronger guardrails against AI-powered abuses,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Vivienne Zhao, 33, moved to Paris in her 20s. Living in France, far away from her parents, has shifted her understanding of home.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vivienne Zhao, 33, a French teacher. Her words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFor years, I treated belonging as a measure of my worth. I believed that if I spoke well enough, adapted carefully enough, and paid close enough attention to other people's expectations, I would eventually earn my place.\n\nLiving abroad in France taught me otherwise. Not suddenly, and not dramatically, but slowly, through repetition.\n\nI learned that language, effort, and proximity all have limits. That you can do everything \"right\" and still remain slightly outside. And that this distance isn't necessarily a failure, it's often just the reality of living between cultures.\n\nI was born in China and spent my childhood moving between three Chinese cities.\n\nAfter graduating with a journalism degree from a university in central China, I moved alone to Paris in 2015. Inspired by a love of cooking and shows like \"Top Chef,\" I decided to study French cuisine. My father supported the leap, while my mother initially pushed for a more conventional path. Eventually, she came around. At 22, I enrolled at Le Cordon Bleu.\n\nI arrived in Paris with a backpack, a suitcase, and nine months of French study behind me. I believed preparation would carry me through.\n\nVery quickly, that belief was tested. Paris didn't match the France I imagined. It wasn't the welcoming countryside town I'd spent two weeks in for a school exchange when I was 14.\n\nFor someone reserved, like me, forming friendships with locals was harder than I'd imagined.\n\nThere was no single moment when I realized I might never fully \"belong.\" It became clear gradually. During my first two years, I lived in a house with Chinese students. I attended language exchanges, hoping to connect with French people and feel closer to local life. Conversations were pleasant, but fleeting.\n\nEnglish — which I'd been taught in school — became essential. My closest friendships were with other international students.\n\nI started dating a French man, hoping proximity would help. At one of his friend's weddings, I noticed that conversations faded the moment he stepped away — not from exclusion, but uncertainty. We didn't share the same humor, references, or history.\n\nThat experience changed how I saw belonging. It couldn't be earned through effort or language alone. Accepting that freed me from seeing it as a personal failure.\n\nI decided that if I couldn't belong socially, I could at least be reliable. That mindset shaped how I approached work, especially during the five years I spent in French restaurants. I didn't seek attention or closeness. What mattered was competence — meeting expectations and delivering what the chef required.\n\nIn one restaurant, I would arrive hours early to prep and often worked through breaks to keep service running. One night, overwhelmed and out of prepared fish, the chef turned to me. Under pressure, I filleted an entire tuna for service. She was impressed by my speed and precision, and from then on trusted me with full preparations when she was delayed.\n\nI made mistakes, but over time, professional trust became my anchor. Earned quietly through consistency, it offered a form of belonging that didn't rely on intimacy or personality.\n\nThere were subtler distances, too. French humor often relies on teasing and irony, and disagreement signals engagement. Coming from a background that values harmony, I sometimes felt emotionally out of sync, even when socially accepted.\n\nI eventually left the restaurant industry due to its physical intensity. I focused fully on language study, earned a graduate degree in teaching French as a foreign language, and became a French teacher.\n\nFor a long time, I measured my worth through social reactions and assumed distance meant failure. Over time — through age, reflection, journaling, and publishing essays — that mindset softened.\n\nMy understanding of home shifted, too. My mother believes belonging is rooted in permanence, in returning to where you come from. Yet each time I go back to China, I feel an unexpected sense of distance. It shows up in small ways, in the habits I've picked up abroad.\n\nI greet bus drivers or shop staff, often to visible surprise. It's a reminder that I no longer move in the same social rhythm.\n\nNow, after building my own family, sharing daily routines, and caring for our cat, I feel I have a home. Its location matters less than the stability and emotional safety it provides. This hasn't weakened my bond with my parents; if anything, it's made it healthier and more grounded.\n\nHaving lived long-term in two countries, I carry both. China shaped my instincts — how I think, relate, and find comfort — while France shaped my self-worth and independence.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "description": "‘Things didn't progress the way I would have thought they would’, admitted the 79-year-old after surviving an hours-long armed stand-off with Florida police",
    "fullText": "A 79-year-old woman imprisoned for killing her terminally ill husband as part of a botched murder-suicide pact in 2023 has said she wouldn't do anything differently and is “accepting the consequences.”\n\nIt was three years ago this month that Ellen Gilland of New Smyrna Beach, Florida smuggled her husband Jerry's gun into his hospital room in Daytona Beach and fired a single, fatal shot into his head.\n\nAn hours-long standoff ensued, forcing staff and patients to shelter in place until police officers finally threw a nonlethal explosive device into the room and took Gilland into custody.\n\nA judge ultimately accepted Gilland's claim that her actions had been part of an agreement with her 77-year-old husband, but sentenced her to one year in prison and 12 years on probation due to the disruption and fear she had sown among bystanders.\n\nAsked by Fox 35 Orlando whether she would change her actions now, Gilland insisted: \"There wasn't anything else to do.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Gilland told investigators that three weeks beforehand, she and her husband Jerry — who was 77 years old — had agreed that she would kill him and then herself if his illness got worse.\n\n\"I knew what was coming. I knew how difficult it would be to be without him. Not just my best friend, but all of the things that we did for each other...,” she told Fox 35.\n\n\"In the 76 years before this event happened, I had never been in trouble before in my life, and never planned to hurt anyone ever,” she added.\n\nOf her late husband, whom she had known since middle school, she said: \"He was very supportive, very quiet, very generous. He was a lovely person.\"\n\nGilland said that she brought her husband's old gun to the hospital and sat with him talking for a while, before killing him. Afterwards, though, she found she could not go through with the suicide part of her plan.\n\nWhen hospital staff entered the room, however, Gilland — apparently in a state of extreme distress — pointed the gun at them and told them to leave, beginning an armed standoff with police.\n\n\"Tell me what's going on! I don't want to hurt you!\" one officer can be heard shouting on body cam footage.\n\n\"Things didn't progress the way I would have thought they would,\" Gilland admitted in her later interview.\n\nIn the aftermath, Gilland was initially charged with first degree murder, but her charges were reduced by a grant jury. She ultimately pled no contest to manslaughter with a firearm, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer with a firearm.\n\nOne nurse testified during her trial that he had been forced to quit his job after the killing because he \"didn't feel safe anymore\" at the hospital and regularly \"got nightmares\" due to the incident.\n\nGilland told Fox 35 that she had struggled in prison, suffering a heart attack just six weeks into her sentence due to the stress. She did the rest of her time in the infirmary, before being released in November 2025.\n\n\"Most of the guards were very — not really friendly, but accepting,\" she said. \"There were a few of them that were very rude, and shouting, and name-calling.\"\n\nNow released, Gilland is doing court-ordered community service, and will do so monthly as long as she is physically able. She has recently started working at a local animal shelter, according to Fox 35.\n\n\"I’m accepting the consequences,\" she told the outlet. \"I have to figure out how to survive after this.\"\n\nShe also told the outlet that she would try to live out the rest of her life without her husband, while advocating for some form of assisted suicide to be legalized.\n\n\"I don't want people feeling sorry for me. I did what I did,\" she said.\n\nIf you are experiencing feelings of distress, or are struggling to cope, you can speak to the Samaritans, in confidence, on 116 123 (UK and ROI), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritans website to find details of your nearest branchIf you are based in the USA, and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call or text 988, or visit 988lifeline.org to access online chat from the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

The deal makes Rodman the highest-paid player in NWSL history and, per her agent Mike Senkowski, the highest-paid women’s soccer player in the world. The announcement was made at an event in Los Angeles alongside Spirit owner Michele Kang and club executives, while Rodman continues training with the USWNT.\n\nMORE: Athlete cult favorite Jack in the Box announces 75th anniversary streetwear drop\n\n“It feels amazing. I’m very happy, I’m very blessed,” Rodman said after signing. “I think it’s a monumental and game-changing moment right now.” She added that the deal aligns with her long-term vision, calling it “perfect timing with the World Cup happening in the U.S.”\n\nThe agreement closes a chaotic chapter that began when Rodman’s previous contract expired on Dec. 31. Despite being the league’s most recognizable star, she entered the offseason without a deal, fueling speculation that she could leave the National Women's Soccer League entirely. Sources indicated that top clubs abroad — particularly in England — had made lucrative offers that Washington could not match under the league’s salary cap, which stood at $3.5 million per team in 2025.\n\nIn late November, Rodman and the Spirit reportedly reached a creative four-year agreement that would have averaged more than $1 million per season. That proposal was later rejected by the league, with commissioner Jessica Berman ruling that it violated league rules. The NWSL also accused Rodman of attempting to circumvent the cap, prompting the NWSL Players Association to file a grievance on her behalf, calling the intervention a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nAs the standoff intensified, the league’s board of governors approved a new High Impact Player (HIP) rule in December, allowing teams to exceed the salary cap by up to $1 million for certain star players. Spirit president of soccer operations Haley Carter confirmed that Rodman’s new contract benefited from the implementation of that rule.\n\n“Not only me personally but all of us at the Spirit are profoundly grateful that she has chosen to stay with us,” Kang said, referencing the “very compelling alternatives” Rodman had elsewhere.\n\nMORE: Ex-NFL QB Kellen Mond roasts former head coach: 'Leadership is an atmosphere you create'\n\nRodman, drafted second overall by Washington in 2021, helped deliver the club’s first NWSL championship as a rookie and has remained its centerpiece ever since.",

This Wednesday (28th), the first round of the country’s main club championship kicks off with eight matches.\n\nThe opening round will be completed on Thursday (29th) with two more games!\n\nThis year, Atlético-MG, Bahia, Botafogo, Corinthians, Cruzeiro, Flamengo, Fluminense, Grêmio, Internacional, Mirassol, Palmeiras, RB Bragantino, Santos, São Paulo, Vasco, and Vitória are joined by Athletico-PR, Coritiba, Chapecoense, and Remo.\n\nFlamengo is the current champion and boasts a star-studded squad (with the possibility of reinforcing with Lucas Paquetá) to lift the trophy once again.\n\nPalmeiras, who last won the title in 2023, is betting on coach Abel Ferreira’s competitiveness to reclaim the top spot and remain comfortably the biggest winner of the Brazilian Championship (12 titles).\n\nThis year, unlike previous ones, the competition will reward the top five teams in the standings with a direct spot in the group stage of the 2027 Conmebol Libertadores. In other words, now it’s G-5!\n\nAt the bottom, however, the “danger zone” still includes four clubs—the famous Z-4.\n\nBesides that, who will be this year’s “Mirassol”?

Serena Williams was knocked out by top seed Martina Hingis.\n\nHingis knocked out Venus Williams in the semi-finals, and she would face Jennifer Capriati in the final after the young American defeated Davenport.\n\nCapriati defeated Hingis 6-4, 6-3 to claim her first major singles title. She went on to defend her title in 2002, defeating Hingis in the final once again.\n\nThe American contingent have certainly placed themselves in a strong position heading into the last few rounds of the 2026 Australian Open.\n\nAmanda Anisimova is perhaps the most likely American player to win the title, considering she is yet to drop a set in Melbourne.\n\nHowever, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula should not be written off. Gauff possesses more grit than any other player on the Tour and rarely shirks from the big occasion at Grand Slams, while Pegula more than proved her credentials by beating Madison Keys so handily on Monday.\n\nIva Jovic is the outside contender, and she has a tricky quarter-final match in the form of Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one.\n\nIf Jovic upsets the two-time Australian Open champion, she will be considered a major contender for the title.",

    "fullText": "Alabama, Ole Miss, Tennessee and Texas A&M have emerged as the top four schools in the recruitment of Brentwood (Tenn.) Academy four-star safety Kenneth Simon II.\n\nThat’s no surprise, as he’s spoken about his interest in the quartet of programs with Rivals over the last few weeks. On Monday, he officially named them as his top four schools.\n\nSimon is the No. 226 overall prospect and No. 25 safety in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 10 recruit in Tennessee.\n\nWhen speaking with Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman earlier this month, Simon said that he was nearing his college commitment. He’s now made the next step and continues to work towards that decision.\n\n“It’s getting down to the wire,” Simon told Rivals. “I don’t know if it’ll be before or after (official visits). I have to talk about it with my family, but I’m close to the finish line. Checking out a few more details before I make the decision.”\n\nSimon, a Tennessee legacy, was back in Knoxville two weekends ago for the Vols’ junior day. He was then on A&M’s visit list over the weekend and is set to return to Tuscaloosa this weekend.\n\nAhead of competing at the Navy All-American Bowl earlier this month, Simon discussed his interest in his top four with Spiegelman:\n\nAlabama: “When you think of Alabama, you think of winning,” he started. “As long as I’ve been alive, they’ve been winning. The standard at ‘Bama — I wanna be a part of that standard. It’s held high and you always wanna go somewhere with a high standard. Coach (Kane) Womack and DeBoer, talking to them has been cool. They brought my family in and talked about my fit there, and it was fun.”\n\nOle Miss: “Coach (Jake) Schoonover saw me last year. He and I are real tight, and Coach (Jay) Shoop just got promoted. He used to work with my dad at Tennessee,” Simon said. “Pete Golding is smart and knows what he’s talking about when it comes to linebacker. Henry To’oto’o came from De La Salle High and played for Pete at Bama. He told me Coach Golding is one of the smartest dudes he ever sat in the meeting room with. Being around people like that, getting my ball knowledge up would help.”\n\nTennessee: “Coach Inge and I have a really good relationship. I grew up around Knoxville and Coach Inge is a great coach,” Simon said. “Coach (Josh) Heuepel is good at building relationships. Our relationship is very good. We talk about how I fit into their system schematically, and it’s everything I would wanna do in college, so I like that.”\n\nTexas A&M: “Coach Troop and I have a good relationship,” he said. “Coach (Mike) Elko is doing a great job, getting great players. Their recruiting class is insane right now. The defense is huge, it’s physical, and they play the right way. That’s what I like about A&M.”",

    "fullText": "Sarasota (Fla.) Cardinal Mooney quarterback Davin Davidson made a splash at the Elite 11 Miami Regional earlier this month and his recruitment is now exploding.\n\nHis offer sheet has quickly expanded and Power Four programs continue to join the list. Michigan State and Louisville both offered on Monday.\n\nDavidson visited Florida over the weekend, left with an offer and was then visited by Gators head coach Jon Sumrall. Kentucky issued an offer on Sunday, while Florida State, North Carolina, Iowa, Virginia Tech, Duke and Miami led the offer avalanche last week.\n\nThe 6-foot-6, 200-pounder won the accuracy challenge at the Elite 11 Regional. Invites to the Elite 11 Finals won’t sent for a while, but there’s reason to believe that he could find himself in Los Angeles this summer.\n\n“It felt good,” Davidson told Rivals’ Marcus Benjamin after the competition. “It was a fun one to compete against the best; I just had to trust my craft and get the job done.”\n\nNC State and Northwestern were the first to offer Davidson. Both got in early, but there’s plenty of competition now. Florida has quickly grabbed some momentum after offering while Davidson was on campus.\n\n“The energy was electric,” Davidson told Rivals’ Chad Simmons about his time in The Swamp. “You could feel it throughout the building.”\n\nDavidson is currently unranked in the 2027 cycle, but that will soon change.\n\nQuarterbacking Cardinal Mooney to a Florida 2A state title, Davidson had a big junior season. He threw for nearly 2,400 yards and 23 touchdowns, completing over 64 percent of his passes. He also rushed for three scores.\n\nThe Cougars went 14-2 and finished as the No. 34 team in the nation and No. 4 team in Florida, according to the Rivals Composite Rankings. Davidson will return as one of the top senior arms in the Sunshine State in 2026.",

And while many have pushed back against the move, others believe it was long overdue.\n\nOne of those people is Tyler Dunne of Go Long, who revealed on The Jim Rome Showthat the relationship between McDermott and quarterback Josh Allen wasn't great.\n\n\"Not necessarily toxic,\" Dunne said. \"It's not like Josh Allen and Sean McDermott were in the weight room wrestling and getting each other pinned down. It wasn't that bad. But the relationship wasn't that great, either. I've talked to players, coaches, people around this dynamic, and it's something that hasn't been talked about, written about a lot, but I've heard it kind of brewing for a while.\"\n\nDunne added that after the infamous 13 seconds game loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, McDermott took no accountability.\n\n\"Sean McDermott took no accountability for [the 13 seconds game loss],\" Dunne said. \"He overruled his special teams coordinator Heath Farwell, who wanted a squib. Sean goes, 'Touchback.' Takes over Leslie Frazier's play-calling. You got your DBs lining up in another zip code and you lose that game. He basically points the finger at all of the assistant coaches and says, 'You guys need to figure out what happened here.\"\n\nDunne continues by saying that owner Terry Pegula and general manager Brandon Beane saw that the team needed to flow through Josh Allen - something that McDermott disagreed with.\n\n\"I feel like when the calculus changed and Terry Pegula the owner, Brandon Beane the GM, scouts, coaches, players all kind of realized that the operation should flow through Josh Allen. Like, this is the center of your universe - Sean McDermott did not get on board with that. He believed the team kind of runs through him [and] his culture.\n\nNow with McDermott gone, the Bills need to hit a home run with their next head coach, and that coach will need to bring immediate success.\n\nFormer Bills edge rusher blames Sean McDermott for 13 seconds loss to Chiefs\n\nAnother head coaching candidate tells Browns he is not interested\n\nMel Kiper Jr predicts Ravens will draft top wide receiver to pair with Lamar Jackson\n\nMiami Dolphins steal top assistant coach from Buffalo Bills\n\nBuffalo Bills star played entire season with major knee injury",

    "description": "Among mathematicians, he is likened to Einstein. Among others, he evokes gossip and pity. From the depths of his self-imposed isolation, Alexander Grothendieck has sent us a vast, introspective work: Crops and Seeds. Mathematician Pierre Cartier, one of Grothendieck’s colleagues, offers a rational and honest appraisal the work and the man.",
    "fullText": "There is no need to introduce Alexander Grothendieck to mathematicians: he is one of the great scientists of the twentieth century. His personality should not be confused with his reputation among gossips, that of a man on the margin of society, who undertook the deliberate destruction of his work, or at any rate the conscious destruction of his own scientific school, even though it had been enthusiastically accepted and developed by first-rank colleagues and disciples.\n\nGrothendieck’s journey? A childhood devastated by Nazism and its crimes, a father who was absent in his early years and then disappeared in the storm, a mother who kept him in her orbit and long disturbed his relationships with other women. He compensated for this with a frantic investment in mathematical abstraction until psychosis, kept at bay through this very involvement, caught up with him and swallowed him in morbid anguish.\n\nGrothendieck is difficult to categorize. Like Carl Friedrich Gauss, Bernhard Riemann, and many other mathematicians, he was obsessed with the notion of space. But his originality lay in deepening of the concept of a geometric point.1 Such research may seem trifling, but the metaphysical stakes are considerable; the philosophical problems it engenders are still far from solved. In its ultimate form, this research, Grothendieck’s proudest, revolved around the concept of a motive, or pattern, viewed as a beacon illuminating all the incarnations of a given object through their various ephemeral cloaks. But this concept also represents the point at which his incomplete work opened to a void. Grothendieck’s idiosyncrasy prompted him fully to accept this flaw. Most scientists are somewhat keener to erase their footprints from the sand, silence their fantasies and dreams, and devote themselves to the statue within, as François Jacob puts it.\n\nFrom the depths of the isolation he has imposed upon himself since 1990, Grothendieck has sent us a vast, introspective work: Récoltes et Semailles (Crops and Seeds).2 If its existence has given rise among some to an unwholesome curiosity, I will nonetheless stick to offering as rational and honest an appraisal of the work as possible before permitting the book itself to elucidate the remarkable enterprise of a no less exceptional man.\n\nThere were three personalities: father, mother, and son, each in a unique way remarkable; and a phantom: an older half sister whom he did not know very well, on the mother’s side, who died recently in the United States. To the best of my knowledge, the father’s name was Schapiro, suggesting Hassidic roots. Breaking family tradition, Schapiro was drawn to Russia’s revolutionary Jewish circles, and at the age of seventeen took part in the failed 1905 revolution against the Czar. He paid for this effort with more than ten years in prison and was only released during the 1917 revolution. This marked the beginning of an endless period of revolutionary wandering and the first of a long series of incarcerations. At last, after Franco’s victory in Spain, he was reunited with his wife Hanka and their son Alexander, refugees in France. By then, his son attests, he was a broken man. He drifted aimlessly for a while; then, like so many other antifascist refugees, he was interned in ear1y 1939 in the Vernet Camp, until the Vichy authorities handed him to the Nazis, and he disappeared into Auschwitz.3\n\nHanka Grothendieck—Alexander took his mother’s surname—was a northern German. During the 1920s, she was active in various far-left groups and tried her hand at writing. She already had a daughter when she met Schapiro. Alexander was born in Berlin in March 1928.4 She immigrated to France when Hitler came to power and eked out a meager existence in German émigré circles. Hanka and her son were interned in Mende in 1939, and would only find respite after the debacle of June 1940.\n\nAlexander (he was long insistent upon this spelling) was abandoned by his parents when they left Germany. He remained hidden on a farm in northern Germany until 1938 (he was then ten years old), raised by a teacher of the Freinet school who believed in a return to Nature. He passed the years from 1942 to 1944 in Chambon-sur-Lignon, a pleasant resort town (in normal times) that was popular, for the most part, with Protestants. It housed a private high school, the Collège Cévenol, which until 1939 was largely a diploma mill for dim but wealthy Protestant youth. During the war, however, under Pastor Trocmé’s energetic influence, the Collège Cévenol became a center of spiritual resistance to Nazism, one dedicated to the rescue of Jewish children. Grothendieck was a boarder at the Foyer Suisse and a student at the Collège. He left so strong an impression that even in the late 1950s, I was able to coax accounts of him from witnesses.\n\nHis childhood came to an end. He graduated from the Collège Cévenol and became a student at Montpellier in 1945. Then began the period of his scientific training.\n\nHis first explicitly mathematical episode occurred when he was an undergraduate. He described himself as very unhappy with the education given at the time. His professor told him that a certain Lebesgue had already solved all (!) the problems in mathematics, but that it would be too difficult to teach. So alone, with almost no guidance, Grothendieck reconstructed a very general version of the Lebesgue integral. In Récoltes et Semailles, he describes in detail the genesis of this first mathematical work, achieved in isolation; he honestly believed that he was the only mathematician in the world.5\n\nWhen he arrived in Paris in 1948, mathematics degree in hand, his public period began. His professor from Montpellier had recommended him to his own former professor, Élie Cartan, unaware that Cartan was now much diminished, and that he had a son, Henri Cartan, who was as famous as his father and would henceforth dominate the Parisian—thus French—mathematical scene.\n\nThere was little love lost between Henri Cartan, the great Protestant university professor, and the young, self-taught rebel. André Weil thus suggested sending Grothendieck to Nancy; there, Jean Delsarte, one of the Bourbaki group’s mentors, had skillfully promoted himself into a position as dean of faculty, making Bourbaki’s infiltration possible.6 Jean Dieudonné and Laurent Schwartz knew how to discipline Grothendieck just enough to prevent him from overextending himself, and how to restrain his immoderate taste for extreme generality. They also knew how to give him problems like Lebesgue’s integration. Quickly, the disciple overtook his masters: alone, unaided, and isolating himself deliberately, he dominated the domain of Functional Analysis.\n\nAt the same time, a liaison with his landlady in Nancy led to the birth of a son, Serge. When a few years later Grothendieck sought to care for Serge himself, he embarked upon a custody lawsuit that had little chance of succeeding. But this was only the beginning of his chaotic family life: in all, he had five children by three mothers, and would be as absent a father to them as his own father was to him.\n\nHis mathematical work in Nancy had established his renown, and he might well have sailed along on that momentum. But he described himself well when he said that he was a builder of houses in which he was not meant to live. He embarked upon the classical career of a researcher, was quickly recruited to the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, National Center for Scientific Research), promoted, and then spent a few years abroad after writing his dissertation. When he returned from São Paulo, he closed the chapter on Functional Analysis. That was the beginning of his master period, 1958 to 1970, which coincided with the Bourbaki group’s prime. The springboard that allowed him to do this phenomenal work was given to him by Léon Motchane, a brilliant businessman who had thrown himself into the creation of the IHÉS (Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques, Institute for Advanced Scientific Studies) in Bures-sur-Yvette. Motchane offered Dieudonné, who had just completed his theory of formal groups, the future institute’s first chair in mathematics. Dieudonné accepted on the condition that he hire Grothendieck as well. The duo then recruited Jean-Pierre Serre, who with his keen sense of the unity of mathematics, high scientific culture, quickness of mind, and technical prowess, would keep them on their toes. Serre acted as an intermediary between Weil and Grothendieck when they no longer wished to communicate directly, and contributed greatly to the clarification of the Weil conjectures. Serre was the perfect beater of mathematical pheasants (I was going to say matchmaker), scaring the quarry straight into Grothendieck’s nets, and in nets as strong as those, the quarry barely struggled.\n\nGrothendieck was then moved to create one of the most prestigious mathematics seminars the world has ever seen. Surrounded by young talent, he threw himself with a passion into mathematical discovery, in sessions lasting from ten to twelve hours!7 He formulated a formidable program intended to fuse arithmetic, algebraic geometry, and topology. A builder of cathedrals, as he put it in his own allegory, he distributed the work to his teammates. Every day, he sent interminable and illegible mathematical feuilletons to Dieudonné, who, sitting at his worktable from five to eight each morning, transformed the scribbles into an imposing collection of volumes co-signed by Dieudonné and Grothendieck and then published in the IHÉS’ Publications Mathématiques. Dieudonné abjured all personal ambition and consecrated himself to this service with the same self-abnegation he had demonstrated under Bourbaki. He nonetheless only stayed at the IHÉS for a few years; upon the creation of the University of Nice, he became its first Dean of Sciences. But that did not end his collaboration with Grothendieck, and he even found the energy to organize the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice, in 1970.8\n\nThe IHÉS team’s success was immediate and resounding. As early as 1962, Serre declared that algebraic geometry and scheme theory were identical.9 Direct and indirect publications on the subject grew to the thousands of pages. After Grothendieck’s retreat from mathematics, Pierre Deligne and Luc Illusie labored to finish publishing the Algebraic Geometry Seminars series, for which Grothendieck was ungrateful. Grothendieck’s school closed in on itself; the generosity of spirit associated with it disappeared; a breath was stifled; but then, the same is true for Bourbaki’s enterprise.10\n\nGrothendieck’s scientific renown reached its apogee in 1966. He was to receive the crowning honor, the Fields Medal, at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Moscow.11 While the Soviet authorities were scant inclined to give him a visa (his father had become an “enemy of the people” after the 1917 revolution), they still believed they might leverage mathematicians in the highly virulent Cold War. (The small demonstration organized by Smale in Moscow nonetheless clearly showed them how difficult mathematicians were to manipulate.) Grothendieck did not show up.\n\nIt was thus, in the context of this event, as well as the opening of a social rift (Berkeley’s fever, in 1965, led to May 1968 in France), that Grothendieck’s fault line ruptured, or rather that his deepest wound was reopened. This wound was that of his Russian Jewish father, remembered in a country where anti-Semitism was resurgent; it was coupled with a “Nobel syndrome,” particularly since the Fields Medal crowned an unfinished agenda and his suspicion that he would never reach the goal of his scientific ambitions.12 In parallel with this, the ambient social rift revealed to him his own contradictions. He, who saw himself as an outlaw and an anarchist, suddenly discovered that he was in fact a mandarin of the international scientific world, one who wielded authority over ideas and people. In a period when all authority was contested, he was ill at ease with this double personality. His temporary response was to found a tiny group that expressed itself in a newsletter called Survivre (Survival) and later Survivre et vivre (Survival and Life). This movement resembled one of those ecological-doom sects that sprung up in the 1970s, the danger (real at the time) of nuclear war merging with the obsession with pollution and overpopulation. He probably believed that social arguments, too, could be made using techniques of mathematical proof. In the end, he managed only to antagonize his audience.\n\nThere followed a few years of wandering: he resigned from the IHÉS on a relatively minor pretext13 in September 1970, traveled abroad, took a temporary position at the Collège de France, and finally a position as a professor at the University of Montpellier of his youth, a place for which he had only modest esteem.14\n\nDuring his years in Montpellier, one event in particular was a milestone: his trial. Grothendieck had always welcomed marginal sorts into his home. In the 1970s, many hippie groups became attached to the regions of Lozère and Larzac, and seen from the outside, Grothendieck’s house was the very embodiment of a phalanstery, he one of the gurus. Following a few incidents, real or exaggerated, the local police raided Grothendieck’s house. The only crime that they could pin on him was his hosting of a Japanese Buddhist monk, a former mathematics student at the Tata Institute in Bombay and an entirely inoffensive character, but one whose residence permit in France had expired. The unexpected result was a summons, six months later, to the Magistrate’s Court of Montpellier, by which time the Japanese monk had, of course, long since disappeared to the Antipodes. And what should have been a ten-minute expedited procedure became a major event. Grothendieck appeared at the Bourbaki Seminar in Paris to alert some of his colleagues: Laurent Schwartz, Alain Lascoux and me. By the day of the trial, the judge had received two hundred letters in favor of the accused, and a chartered airplane disgorged a medley of supporters wearing Dean’s robes (with Dieudonné at their head), the ecclesiastical fringe of the champagne socialist set, legal heavyweights. Grothendieck acted as his own lawyer, preferring the risk of losing the trial to accepting concessions on form. He gave a magnificent speech for the defense. Alas, as Grothendieck had predicted, the craven judge sentenced him to a six-month suspended sentence. The sentence was upheld on appeal, but by then the media excitement had died away.\n\nGrothendieck retired in 1988, and has lived since in an interior exile in a little village in Ariège (a department in the Midi-Pyrénées region of southwestern France). He seems to have broken off all family ties. It is not insignificant that he lives so close to the Vernet Camp, which is sadly infamous, but above all associated with his childhood. He has neither a telephone nor a known postal address, and only a select few know the exact location of his retirement, having promised not to divulge it. He lives alone, perceived by his neighbors as a “slightly eccentric retired mathematics professor.” He has translated his spirituality into Buddhist terms, and kept from his orthodox Jewish ancestors a respect for dietary taboos: he practices the most extreme form of vegetarianism, and seems as a result to have compromised his health.\n\nPresenting Grothendieck’s scientific work in a few pages to a lay audience is a challenge. To do so, I will make use of the analysis offered by Dieudonné, long Grothendieck’s closest associate, in his introduction to the Festschrift produced on the occasion of Grothendieck’s sixtieth birthday.15\n\nGeorg Cantor’s Set Theory allowed its twentieth-century heirs to create Functional Analysis. This is an extension of the classical Differential and Integral Calculus (created by Leibniz and Newton), in which one considers not merely a particular function (such as the exponential function or a trigonometric function), but the operations and transformations that can be performed on all functions of a certain type. The new theory of integration, created at the beginning of the twentieth century by Émile Borel and above all by Henri Lebesgue, and the invention of normed spaces by Stefan Banach, Maurice Fréchet, and Norbert Wiener, yielded new tools for construction and proof in mathematics. Functional Analysis is a seductive theory in its generality, simplicity, and harmony, and it can resolve difficult problems elegantly. However, it often makes use of nonconstructive methods (the Hahn-Banach theorem, Baire’s theorem and its consequences), which, when used to prove the existence of a mathematical object, cannot always provide an effective method for its construction. (Are there two irrational numbers a and b such that ab is rational? The obvious proof indicates that there are, but fails to identify the numbers). It is unsurprising that a beginner, delighted by the theory, responded enthusiastically to what he learned about Functional Analysis from his somewhat old-fashioned professors in Montpellier.\n\nUpon his arrival in the Parisian mathematical world in 1948, at the age of twenty, Grothendieck had already written a voluminous manuscript in which he reconstructed a very general version of the Lebesgue integral. Once established in a favorable milieu in Nancy, where Jean Dieudonné, Jean Delsarte, Roger Godement and Laurent Schwartz (all active members of the Bourbaki group) were striving to go beyond Banach’s work on Functional Analysis, he revolutionized the subject, and even in a sense annihilated it. In his thesis, written in 1953 and published in 1955, he created from scratch a theory of tensor products for Banach spaces and their generalizations, and invented the concept of a nuclear space in order to explain Laurent Schwartz’s important kernel theorem about functional operators. Russian mathematicians influenced by Israel Gelfand would make essential use of nuclear spaces, and it would become one of the keys to applying techniques from probability theory to problems in Mathematical Physics (statistical mechanics, “constructive” quantum field theory). Grothendieck abandoned this after writing a dense and profound article on metric inequalities, one that fueled the research of an entire school (Gilles Pisier and his colleagues) for forty years. He cared little about the consequences of his ideas, and was indifferent, even hostile, towards theoretical physics, a discipline guilty of the destruction of Hiroshima.\n\nGrothendieck then began a second mathematical career at the age of twenty-seven. It was 1955, the golden age of French mathematics, when mathematicians in Bourbaki’s orbit, and under the leadership of Henri Cartan, Laurent Schwartz and Jean-Pierre Serre attacked the most difficult problems of geometry, group theory, and topology. New tools appeared: sheaf theory and homological algebra (invented by Jean Leray in the first case, and by Henri Cartan and Samuel Eilenberg in the second: their treatise Homological Algebra was published in 1956). These were admirable in their generality and flexibility. The apples of the Garden of the Hesperides were the famous conjectures stated by André Weil in 1949. These seemed to represent a combinatorial problem of daunting generality (counting the number of solutions for equations with variables in a Galois field), even though many significant special cases were already known.\n\nGrothendieck’s first foray into this new domain came as a thunderclap. It was known by the nickname “Tōhoku” because it appeared in the Japanese Tōhoku Mathematical Journal in 1957 under the modest title “Sur quelques points d’algèbre homologique” (Some Aspects of Homological Algebra).16 Homological algebra, intended to be a general tool that reached beyond all the special cases, was already a vast synthesis of known methods and results. But sheaves do not enter into this framework. Jean Leray constructed sheaves and their homology ad hoc, imitating the geometric methods of Élie Cartan (Henri Cartan’s father). In the autumn of 1950 Eilenberg, who was spending a year in Paris, began with Cartan to give an axiomatic characterization of sheaf homology, yet the construction retained its ad hoc character. When Serre introduced sheaves into algebraic geometry in 1953, the seemingly pathological nature of the Zariski topology forced him into some very indirect constructions. Grothendieck’s genius consisted in solving the problem from above, a method he would often use. Analyzing the success of homological algebras in the context of modules, he unearthed the notion of an abelian category (simultaneously invented by David Buchsbaum), and above all the condition he called AB5*. This condition guaranteed the existence of so-called injective objects. The sheaves satisfying condition AB5*, the method of injective resolutions that is fundamental for modules, extends to sheaves in general without the need for any artifice. Not only does it lend a sound basis to the construction of sheaf homology, it provides an absolutely parallel development for modules and sheaves, bringing the Ext and Tor functors over to sheaves. Everything is natural again.\n\nAfter this initiation (1955–1958), Grothendieck announced his research program: to create arithmetic geometry via a (new) reformulation of algebraic geometry, seeking maximal generality by appropriating the new tools created for use in topology and already tested by Cartan, Eilenberg, and Serre. He dared attack the synthesis that none of the actors at the time (Claude Chevalley, Serge Lang, Masyoshi Nagata, Jean-Pierre Serre, me) had dared, throwing himself headlong into the work with characteristic energy and enthusiasm. Grothendieck’s undertaking thrived thanks to unexpected synergies: the immense capacity for synthesis and for work of Dieudonné, promoted to the rank of scribe; Serre’s rigorous, rationalist and well-informed spirit; the practical know-how in geometry and algebra of Oscar Zariski’s students; the youthful freshness of his great disciple Pierre Deligne—all acted as counterweights to Grothendieck’s adventurous, visionary, and wildly ambitious spirit. The new IHÉS mobilized a constellation of young international talent. Organized around the key notion of a scheme, Grothendieck’s theory ended up annexing every part of geometry, even the newest parts such as the study of algebraic groups.17 Using a gigantic apparatus—Grothendieck topologies (étale, crystalline ... ), descent, derived categories, the six operations, characteristic classes, monodromy groups, and so on—Grothendieck arrived halfway to the final goal, the Weil conjectures. In 1974, Deligne completed the proof, but Grothendieck had, by 1970, and after twelve years of undisputed scientific reign over the IHÉS, lost his own organizing center and had let things fall apart. Until his official retirement in 1988 at the age of sixty, he worked only in spurts, nonetheless leaving a significant “posthumous” body of work.\n\nThere are three main texts: À la poursuite des champs (Pursuing Stacks),18 written in 1983, is a six hundred-page reflection on multi-dimensional categories. Combinatorics, geometry, and homological algebra come together in an imposing project. After more than fifteen years of the combined efforts of many, three (probably nearly equivalent) definitions have been proposed for multidimensional categories (broadly defined).19 They are not only important for pure mathematics since a theory of such constructions would have many potential applications in theoretical computer science, statistical physics, etc. The second, Esquisse d’un programme (Sketch of a Program),20 was a text written in 1984 for inclusion in the application for a position with the CNRS. In it, Grothendieck sketches (the word is exact) the construction of a tower (or a game of Lego) describing deformations of algebraic curves. Finally, La Longue Marche à travers la théorie de Galois (Long March Through Galois Theory),21 written in 1981, gives partial indications about some of the constructions suggested in the Esquisse.\n\nThose texts were all passed around hand-to-hand, with the exception of the Esquisse, which was finally published at the insistence of a group of devotees. Curiously, the true heirs of Grothendieck’s work are essentially members of a Russian mathematical school (Yuri Manin, Vladimir Drinfeld, Alexander Goncharov, Maxim Kontsevitch, to cite just a few), who have had little if any direct contact with Grothendieck. Nonetheless, they inherited and knew how to make use of methods from mathematical physics, a domain he disregarded and abhorred.\n\nPublished in two series, Grothendieck’s work in algebraic geometry amounts to more than ten thousand pages. Entitled Éléments de Géométrie Algébrique (Elements of Algebraic Geometry, or ÉGA), an appeal to both Euclid’s Elements and Bourbaki, the first was written entirely by Dieudonné, and has remained unfinished; of the thirteen parts that were initially planned, only four were written. The second series, the composition of which was more tumultuous, is called Séminaires de Géométrie Algébrique (Seminars in Algebraic Geometry, or SGA) and comprises seven parts. It covers the Seminars in the Bois-Marie (named after the location of the IHÉS), which Grothendieck led from 1960 to 1969. The first two parts were written by Grothendieck, or under his control, and he personally supervised their publication; as for the third, it was essentially written by Pierre Gabriel and Michel Demazure (whose dissertation was extracted from this work). Afterward, things became more complex. When Grothendieck abandoned the mathematical scene in 1970, he left behind unfinished business, and the workplace was in a pitiful state. He left indecipherable manuscripts, mimeographed lectures from the seminars, notes for publication. They needed to be synthesized and the (sizeable) gaps filled in; it was an epic task. Luc Illusie and Pierre Deligne accomplished all of this with great fidelity and filial piety. The centerpiece, in view of the Weil conjectures, is SGA 4, dedicated to the most innovative of ideas. But when Deligne announced his proof of the Weil conjectures in 1974, experts considered the foundations of his proof to be incomplete. Deligne then published (along with the missing link from the Grothendieck seminar, SGA 5) an additional volume, which he basically drafted by himself, titled, curiously, SGA 4 ½. Grothendieck dismissed the entire enterprise. This was not what he, Grothendieck, had had in mind; his plans had been truncated; they had betrayed him. He described his feelings by means of a strong image: that of a team of builders who, now that their Master is dead, disperse, each one carrying away his own sketches and tools. It would be a morally powerful image were it not for the fact that, far from dying, the Master had simply abandoned his team.\n\nGrothendieck had a taste and a talent for naming things, which he used as a major intellectual strategy. Thus, my title, “A Country Known Only by Name,” is an homage to his way with words. He had a special talent for naming things before possessing and conquering them, and many of his terminological choices were remarkable. He sought mental images to illustrate his scientific ideas; these included la belle demeure parfaite (the perfect mansion) and le beau château dont on a hérité (the beautiful, inherited castle). He described himself as a builder. He juggled all these allegories in a fantastic register of language. And this is all the more surprising and striking because his native language was German, the only language he used to communicate with his mother until her death. But if he long thought in German, he nevertheless subsequently acquired an acute sense of French; his bilingualism allowed him to play discerningly with Germanisms.\n\nHaving a taste for symbolism, Grothendieck recognized twelve disciples, just as he divided Récoltes et Semailles into twelve themes, of which I will only comment on a few. A large number of the themes concern Grothendieck’s grand enterprise: algebraic geometry. The great problems constitute great enigmas, whose relatively simple formulation offers no obvious point of attack. What was improperly known as Fermat’s Last Theorem was a conjecture of Biblical simplicity: the relation an + bn = cn is impossible if a, b, c, n are whole numbers, unless n = 2. Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor required a large and complex edifice, based largely on Weil and Grothendieck’s methods, to establish the proof. The most prestigious and confusing of contemporary problems is the Riemann Conjecture. In 1930, Helmut Hasse (following Emil Artin and Friedrich Schmidt) formulated and solved a problem similar to the Riemann Conjecture by translating it into the form of an inequality. The next step would occupy Weil from 1940 to 1948. When Weil formulated his famous conjectures in 1949, he was guided by these ideas.\n\nFor Grothendieck, the Weil conjectures are not so much interesting in themselves, but as a test of his general vision. Grothendieck distinguished between builders and explorers in mathematics, viewing himself as both at once. Grothendieck’s favorite method was similar to Joshua’s for conquering Jericho. One must seize the place by sapping it; at a certain point, it succumbs without a fight. Grothendieck was convinced that if one had a sufficiently unifying vision of mathematics, if one could sufficiently penetrate its conceptual essence, then particular problems would be nothing but tests that no longer need to be solved for their own sake.\n\nThis fashion of conceiving of mathematics worked quite well for Grothendieck, even if his dreams tended to make him go too far at times and he needed the correcting influence of Dieudonné and Serre. Deligne knew every trick of his master’s trade by heart, every concept, every variant. His proof, given in 1974, is a marvel of precision; the steps follow each other in a natural order, without surprise. Every lecture by Grothendieck introduced a whole new world of concepts, each more general than the one before. I think that this opposition of methods, or rather of temperaments, is the true reason behind the personal conflict that pushed them apart. That John, the disciple Jesus loved, wrote the last Gospel by himself played a role, perhaps, in the sullen exile that Grothendieck imposed upon himself.\n\nWe now arrive at the very heart of the unifying vision of Grothendieck’s mathematical method. Of the twelve great ideas of which he was justly proud, he placed three above the others. He offered them in the form of a progression from schemes to motives:\n\nHis whole scientific strategy was, indeed, organized around a progression of increasingly general concepts. The image that comes to my mind is a Buddhist temple that I visited in Vietnam in 1980. According to tradition, the altar comprised a series of rising steps, at the top of which lay an enormous reclining figure of the Buddha. When we follow Grothendieck’s work throughout its development, we likewise sense that we’re gradually evolving toward perfection. The motives represented, in his mind, the final stage, the one he hadn’t yet reached. He had, however, reached the two intermediate stages (scheme and topos).\n\nThe term itself was coined by Chevalley, although accepted in a more restrictive sense than the term as used by Grothendieck. In Foundations of Algebraic Geometry, André Weil had introduced into algebraic geometry the methods used by his mentor, Élie Cartan, in differential geometry (following Carl Friedrich Gauss and Jean Darboux). But Weil’s method was by no means intrinsic, and Chevalley wondered what was invariant, in Weil’s sense of variety. The answer, inspired by Zariski’s work, was simple and elegant: the scheme of an algebraic variety is the collection of local rings of the sub-varieties found inside the rational function field. There is no need for an explicit topology, a point of distinction between Chevalley and Serre, who at roughly the same time introduced his algebraic varieties using Zariski topologies and sheaves. Each of the two approaches had advantages, but also limitations: Serre had an algebraically closed base field; Chevalley had to work only with irreducible varieties. In both cases, the two fundamental problems of products of varieties and base change could only be approached indirectly. All the same, Chevalley’s point of view was better suited to future extensions to arithmetic, as Nagata soon observed.\n\nÉvariste Galois was certainly the first to notice the polarity between equations and their solutions. One must distinguish between the domain in which coefficients of the algebraic equation are chosen and the domain in which solutions are sought. Grothendieck created a synthesis out of these ideas, based in essence on the conceptual presentation of Zariski-Chevalley-Nagata. Schemes are thus a way of encoding systems of equations as well as the transformations to which one may subject them.\n\nGrothendieck presented the Galois problem in the following manner: a scheme is an absolute object, X, say; the choice of a field of constants (or a field of definition) corresponds to the choice of another scheme S and a morphism πX from X to S.22 In the theory of schemes, a commutative ring is identified with a scheme, its spectrum.23 A homomorphism from ring A to ring B likewise maps, inversely, the spectrum of B into the spectrum of A. Moreover, the spectrum of a field has a single underlying point (even though many different points exist, in this sense); consequently, giving the field of definition as being included in the universal domain corresponds to giving a scheme morphism πT from T to S. A solution of the system of equations X, with the domain of constants S, with values in the universal domain T, corresponds to a morphism φ from T to X such that πT is the composition of φ and of πT.\n\nWhat admirable simplicity! Modern mathematics rests upon the primacy of sets. Once one has accepted the existence of sets and the constructions made from them, every mathematical object becomes a set and coincides with the set of its points.24 Transformations are, in principle, transformations of points.25 In the various forms of geometry (differential, metric, affine, algebraic), the central object is the variety, considered as a set of points.26 And for Grothendieck, the scheme is the internal mechanism, the matrix that generates the space’s points.27\n\nThe purely mathematical analysis, Gelfand’s and then Grothendieck’s, of the notion of a point was discovered after a fundamental reevaluation of the status of the point in quantum physics. The most systematic expression of this reevaluation is Alain Connes’ non-commutative geometry. The synthesis is far from complete. The increasingly manifest kinship between the Grothendieck-Teichmüller28 group and the renormalization group in quantum field theory is doubtless only the first manifestation of a symmetry group operating on the fundamental constants of physics, a kind of cosmic Galois group.29 Grothendieck did not predict this development, and probably would not even have welcomed it, owing to his prejudices against physics (due in large part to his vehement rejection of the military-industrial complex).\n\nIn Récoltes et Semailles, Grothendieck for a moment compared himself to Einstein in his contribution to the problem of space. His contribution is indeed of the same magnitude.30 Einstein and Grothendieck both deepened a particular vision in which space is not an empty receptacle for phenomena, but the principal actor in the life of the world and the history of the universe.\n\nLet us now consider toposes.31 Unlike schemes, toposes generate geometry without points. In fact, nothing prevents us from proposing an axiomatic framework for geometry in which points, lines, and planes would all be on the same footing. Thus we know axiomatic systems for projective geometry (George Birkhoff) in which the primitive notion is that of a plate (a generalization of lines and planes), and in which the fundamental relationship is that of incidence. In mathematics, we consider a class of partially ordered sets called lattices; each of these corresponds to a distinct geometry.32\n\nIn the geometry of a topological space, the lattice of open sets plays a starring role, while points are relatively minor. But Grothendieck’s originality was to reprise Riemann’s idea that multivalued functions actually live not on open sets of the complex plane, but on spread-out Riemann surfaces. The spread-out Riemann surfaces project down to each other and thus form the objects of a category. However, a lattice is a special case of a category, since it includes at most one transformation between two given objects. Grothendieck thus proposed replacing the lattice of open sets with the category of spread-out open sets. When adapted to algebraic geometry, this idea solves a fundamental difficulty, since there is no implicit function theorem for algebraic functions. Sheaves can now be considered as special functors on the lattice of open sets (viewed as a category), and can thus be generalized to étale sheaves, which are special functors of the étale topology.\n\nGrothendieck would successfully play many variations on this theme in the context of various problems of geometric construction (for example, the problem of modules for algebraic curves). His greatest success in this regard would be the étale “ℓ-adic” cohomology of schemes, the cohomological theory needed to attack the Weil conjectures.\n\nBut there is still another step towards abstraction. Consider the progression:\n\nSCHEME → ÉTALE COHOMOLOGY → ÉTALE SHEAVES\n\nGrothendieck realized that one could pass directly to the last step, and that all the geometric properties of a scheme are encoded in the category of étale sheaves. This category belongs to a particular type of categories that he called “toposes.”\n\nHere, then, is the last act of the play. Grothendieck had noticed that the sheaves on a given space formed a category that basically had the same properties as the category of sets. But Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen had already demonstrated that there were various non-equivalent models of set theory. It was thus natural to explore the relations that might exist between toposes and models of set theory. Grothendieck knew nothing of logic and probably despised it just as thoroughly as he did physics. It was for others (especially Jean Bénabou, William Lawvere and Myles Tierney) to solve the riddle: toposes perfectly embodied intuitionistic models of set theory. The principle of the excluded middle is not valid. It is most remarkable that this logic was invented by an illustrious topologist, Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, and with hindsight, it arises very naturally because intuitionistic logics may be given topological interpretations.33\n\nThere remain the motives. The image to which Grothendieck appealed was a rocky coastline at night illuminated by a rotating lighthouse, one revealing one part of the coast and then another. Similarly, we see the various known cohomological theories, many of which he himself invented, before we return to the source and build a lighthouse that will depict a unified landscape. In some sense, the scientific strategy is the opposite of the one used in the universe of schemes.\n\nGrothendieck never published anything on this subject. He merely made a few remarks. Vladimir Voevodsky made the most ambitious contribution to this area by constructing a category of objects called motives. But in such a category, pieces of objects can migrate like wandering genes. The image of a genetic inheritance seems to me quite relevant. This was made possible by the use of Deligne’s definition of weight, the centerpiece in his proof of the Weil conjectures.\n\nThe tool created by Voevodsky might have met Grothendieck’s expectations, but it was difficult to use. The right tools should be easy to use. Thus what progress has been made has only been accomplished by restricting our ambitions to such objects as mixed Hodge structures or mixed Tate motives. These are expressions of a fundamental group of symmetries, like the Grothendieck-Teichmüller group. Even in this small field, there is already an enormous amount of work to be done to unearth inestimable treasures. Grothendieck complained that all this was too economical, too reasonable; he heaped reproaches on the tradesmen from his visionary height. But it seems to me that in the presence of mathematical visionaries, such as Grothendieck or Robert Langlands, the right scientific strategy consists in isolating a piece that is precise and narrow enough that we can make progress, but also sufficiently vast to yield interesting results.\n\nWhat is striking about Grothendieck, at first, is an expression of suffering: suffering that work was left unfinished, the feeling of having been betrayed by his collaborators and followers. In a moment of true lucidity, he said something like, “I was the only person to have the breath of inspiration, and what I transmitted to those around me wasn’t inspiration, but a job. I had workmen around me, but none of them really had inspiration!” The comment is deep and true, but it doesn’t explain why he deliberately closed the mouth from which that breath emanated. From what we know of his life today, he is subject to cyclical crises of depression. It seems to me that his capacity for scientific creation was the best antidote to his depression, and that his immersion in a lively scientific milieu (the Bourbaki group and the IHÉS) favored his creativity.\n\nBut here I’d like, especially, to mention the religious aspect of his life, which he claims is deep and permanent. He says that he has had visual and auditory hallucinations. He describes these divine apparitions in Récoltes et Semailles, writing that he sings Gospels in two voices simultaneously, his own and God’s. It was following a series of these hallucinations or apparitions that he sent out a public eschatological message, unaccountably unanswered. Most disturbing is his obsession with the Devil. He is drafting a report.\n\nMathematicans see themselves as the most objective of the scientists. If it is to be communicated without distortion, the mathematics must be detached from the mathematician. The mathematician must be allowed decently to disappear. In practice, this disappearance is quite effective.\n\nGrothendieck represents a special case. He lived apart from the world, much more so than the caricatured absent-minded professor. Even in his mathematical milieu, he wasn’t quite a member of the family. He pursued a kind of monologue, or rather, a dialogue with mathematics and God, which to him were one and the same. His work is unique in that it didn’t efface his fantasies and obsessions, but rather lived in their company and nourished them. He gave us a body of purely mathematical work, and simultaneously offered what he held to be its meaning.\n\nHis life was burned by the fire of the spirit, and he continued to search for a country and for a name. I believe the country was Galicia, and the name was that of his father.\n\nTo the memory of Monique Cartier (1932–2007)\n\nTranslated from the French by the editors.

    "title": "Why has Microsoft been routing example.com traffic to a company in Japan?",
    "description": "Company's autodiscover caused users' test credentials to be sent outside Microsoft networks.",
    "fullText": "From the Department of Bizarre Anomalies: Microsoft has suppressed an unexplained anomaly on its network that was routing traffic destined to example.com—a domain reserved for testing purposes—to a maker of electronics cables located in Japan.\n\nUnder the RFC2606—an official standard maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force—example.com isn’t obtainable by any party. Instead it resolves to IP addresses assigned to Internet Assiged Names Authority. The designation is intended to prevent third parties from being bombarded with traffic when developers, penetration testers, and others need a domain for testing or discussing technical issues. Instead of naming an Internet-routable domain, they are to choose example.com or two others, example.net and example.org.\n\nOutput from the terminal command cURL shows that devices inside Azure and other Microsoft networks have been routing some traffic to subdomains of sei.co.jp, a domain belonging to Sumitomo Electric. Most of the resulting text is exactly what’s expected. The exception is the JSON-based response. Here’s the JSON output from Friday:\n\nSimilarly, results when adding a new account for test@example.com in Outlook looked like this:\n\nIn both cases, the results show that Microsoft was routing email traffic to two sei.co.jp subdomains: imapgms.jnet.sei.co.jp and smtpgms.jnet.sei.co.jp. The behavior was the result of Microsoft’s autodiscover service.\n\n“I’m admittedly not an expert in Microsoft’s internal workings, but this appears to be a simple misconfiguration,” Michael Taggart, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health, said. “The result is that anyone who tries to set up an Outlook account on an example.com domain might accidentally send test credentials to those sei.co.jp subdomains.”\n\nWhen asked early Friday afternoon why Microsoft was doing this, a representative had no answer and asked for more time. By Monday morning, the improper routing was no longer occurring, but the representative still had no answer.\n\nUpdate: in an email sent after this post went live, the representative confirmed that Microsoft has “updated the service to no longer provide suggested server information for example.com.” As already reported here, the behavior only affected people configuring email accounts through the Outlook autoconfiguration feature. The representative added that Microsoft is investigating.\n\nThe new JSON response suggested that, as of Monday morning, Microsoft hadn’t fixed the endpoint routing traffic to the Sumitomo Electric servers. Instead, the JSON response no longer occurs. Where the output was occurring on Friday, the command now simply sits and hangs for 10 or 20 seconds and then terminates with a not found error. This behavior can be seen in the following output:\n\n“It looks like they may have outright removed the endpoint that validates the email, because I’m seeing ‘not found’ errors,” said Dan Tentler, founder of Phobos Group. As denoted by ENOTFOUND, the error “suggests that [Microsoft admins] just ripped out whatever this thing was.”\n\nIt’s unclear how Sumitomo Electric’s domain would have found itself part of this mess. Microsoft last year said the Japanese company’s parent company, Sumitomo Corp., was deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot, but that still doesn’t explain why a subsidiary’s domain was added to Microsoft’s network configuration.\n\nQuestions sent to Microsoft include: How are autodiscover records added at Microsoft; was the routing intentional; and how long has the behavior been occurring? (Tinyapps.org, which noted the odd routing behavior earlier this month, said it lasted five years.) There doesn’t appear to be anything nefarious about the improper routing, and as long as people inside Microsoft’s network weren’t sending live credentials in tests, there was no danger posed.\n\nThere’s still reason for concern. In 2024, Microsoft revealed that one of its admins had assigned administrative privileges to a test account on the company network and then forgot about it. Russia-state hackers seized on the gaffe to gain initial access to Microsoft’s system. They went on to root through the network and monitor top executives’ email for two months. The routing misconfiguration for example.com raises the question: What other possibly more severe errors lurk on the network?",

    "description": "A major shakeup is underway after Border Czar Tom Homan was ordered by Donald Trump to take over the ICE operation in Minnesota, sidelining Kristi Noem.",
    "fullText": "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino - dubbed 'little Napoleon' - has been ordered to leave Minneapolis in a major shakeup initiated by Tom Homan.\n\nDonald Trump sidelined Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday, dispatching Border Czar Homan, an ICE veteran, to take charge of the deteriorating crisis in Minnesota after a protester was shot dead on Saturday.\n\nHoman is expected to hold a press conference later today where Bovino's departure, along with that of hundreds of his agents, will be announced.\n\nThe decision is aimed at de-escalating the violence between federal agents and rioters which exploded on Saturday after the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse.\n\nBovino, the controversial face of Trump's crackdown and a close ally of Noem, sparked fury in the White House when he claimed Pretti intended to 'massacre' federal agents.\n\nTrump spent hours on Sunday and Monday watching cable news coverage and was unsettled by how the administration was being portrayed, one official told CNN.\n\nNoem branded the ICU nurse a 'domestic terrorist' and claimed he brandished a firearm, sparking further frustration among administration officials.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt distanced Trump from Noem's language on Monday, arguing that it was not a position that the President had taken.\n\nBorder Patrol chief Gregory Bovino observes a protest in Minneapolis on January 15\n\nFederal agents point weapons at protesters near the site of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday\n\nBorder Czar Tom Homan visits 'Varney & Co.' at Fox Business Network on January 13\n\nBovino is a loyalist to Noem and her rumored lover Corey Lewandowski, and both have quietly pushed him as a potential replacement for current Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott, a longtime ally of Homan.\n\nNoem has sought to sideline Scott by having Bovino report directly to her, an unprecedented move within the agency.\n\nBovino's removal from Minneapolis underscores Noem's fading standing with the White House as Trump dispatches Homan and his closest allies to seize control of the operation on the ground.\n\nA Border Patrol veteran of 30 years, Bovino was selected last year from his role as chief patrol agent of the agency's El Centro sector in Southern California to lead highly publicized immigration crackdowns across the country.\n\nHis aggressive tactics, often highly choreographed public displays, sparked backlash from local officials.\n\nBovino often stood out as the only agent not wearing a face covering when Border Patrol descended on Home Depots and gas stations.\n\nHe has gone viral on social media as he is frequently spotted on the frontlines sporting a severe buzzcut and trench coat, which German media has likened to a 'Nazi aesthetic'.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said on X: 'Greg Bovino dressed up as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb. Greg Bovino, secret police, private army, masked men, people disappearing quite literally, no due process.'\n\nA protester is pepper sprayed at close range while being detained near the site of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem holds a news conference at the headquarters for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to discuss a major winter storm affecting much of the country as well as the shooting death of a Minneapolis man by federal agents in Minnesota, in Washington, DC, on January 24\n\nBovino hit back, claiming he had the coat for more than 25 years and it was official Border Patrol merchandise.\n\nJenn Budd, an author and expert on Border Patrol, described Bovino as 'the Liberace' of the agency.\n\n'He was just a little Napoleon who wants you to think that he is the most moral and capable guy in the world, and everything around you is dangerous but he's the one who's going to save you,' Budd told The Times. 'It's all a show for him.'\n\nHe once invited journalists to watch him swim across a canal in Southern California's Imperial Valley in a bid to deter migrants considering the crossing.\n\nAfter Trump was re-elected Bovino used similar public relations expertise to catch the president's eye.\n\nHe sent dozens of agents to arrest migrants at gas stations along the highway ahead of Trump's inauguration.\n\nAsked why Bovino was chosen to lead the force, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told reporters bluntly: 'Because he's a badass.'\n\nBut while Bovino's strongman image earned him Trump's respect, his self-proclaimed 'turn and  burn' enforcement strategies have sparked concern.\n\nA federal judge accused Bovino in November of being 'evasive' and at times 'outright lying' in sworn testimony about an immigration crackdown in Chicago, finding his account 'simply not credible.'\n\nJudge Sara Ellis wrote that Bovino even admitted he lied about being hit with a rock before ordering tear gas used, and noted that video evidence flatly contradicted his claim that he never tackled a protester.",

    "title": "AI Motion Control",
    "description": "AI Motion Control platform for transferring movements and expressions from videos to images. Create lifelike video animations with precision.",
    "fullText": "Premier platform for professional AI Motion Control. We empower creators to synchronize complex movements and facial expressions from reference videos to static images with surgical precision.\n\nUpload a character image and a reference motion video. Our AI extracts movements and expressions to animate your image with stunning precision.\n\nWhen Character Orientation matches the video, complex motions perform better; when it matches the image, camera movements are better supported.\n\nClick any example below to preview the motion transfer results\n\nAt aimotioncontrol.net, we don't just generate video; we engineer motion. Our AI Motion Control technology solves the fundamental chaotic nature of diffusion models, anchoring every frame to your exact creative intent.\n\nTransfer movement from any source video to your target character with industry-leading AI Motion Control precision. Unlike standard image-to-video tools that guess movement, our system locks onto the skeletal structure of your reference footage. This ensures that every nuance of the original performance captures the energy and intent of the actor, regardless of the target character's design.\n\nOur AI Motion Control algorithms ensure that every limb, joint, and subtle shift in weight is perfectly transferred. Whether it's a complex dance routine featuring rapid spins or a specific stunt requiring perfect timing, the output matches the input with 99% anatomical accuracy, preserving the physics of the original motion.\n\nMaintain character identity across all frames without distortion. Traditional AI struggles with keeping a character's face and clothes consistent during rapid movement, often resulting in morphing textures. AI Motion Control utilizes temporal attention layers to preserve details from the first frame to the last, ensuring your character looks the same at frame 100 as they did at frame 1.\n\nApply the motion of a human actor to a stylized character (anime, 3D render, claymation) instantly. AI Motion Control handles the stylistic translation while keeping the physics of the movement grounded in reality. You can drive a cartoon character with a human performance or map a human's walk cycle onto a robotic creature.\n\nThe system intelligently adjusts the motion to fit the proportions of your target character. If you map a tall actor's motion to a short goblin character, AI Motion Control automatically recalculates the stride length and center of gravity to ensure the movement looks natural and physically plausible.\n\nClone nuanced facial expressions for emotional storytelling with our dedicated facial AI Motion Control engine. Eyes, mouth shapes, and micro-expressions are mapped faithfully, allowing you to convey complex emotions that standard AI models fail to capture.\n\nSuperior accuracy in mapping complex facial expressions. A smile isn't just a curve of the lips; it's the crinkle of the eyes and the lifting of cheeks. AI Motion Control captures it all, distinguishing between a smirk, a grin, and a laugh with pixel-perfect precision.\n\nPerfect lip synchronization for talking heads and dialogue. Input your audio track, and our AI Motion Control system aligns the mouth movements frame by frame for believable speech, making it an ideal tool for virtual news anchors or storytelling.\n\nEnsure your character is looking exactly where they should be. AI Motion Control allows for precise direction of eye movement, essential for dramatic scenes and connection with the audience. You can control the focal point of your character's attention throughout the video.\n\nCapture the fleeting moments of emotion that bring a character to life. A slight furrow of the brow or a quick widening of the eyes—these subconscious signals are preserved by AI Motion Control, adding a layer of psychological depth to your animations.\n\nAccess a curated collection of movements for instant animation. Don't have a reference video? Use our library powered by AI Motion Control pre-sets to immediately bring your static images to life with professional-grade motion.\n\nBrowse and apply professional motions from our extensive library. From walking and running to complex martial arts, our AI Motion Control database is ready to animate your static images. We categorize motions by intensity, style, and genre for easy discovery.\n\nUpload your own reference videos for unique motion control. The system analyzes your footage and creates a custom motion LoRA that can be applied to any character. You can build your own private library of proprietary movements for your studio.\n\nCombine different motions or blend them together. AI Motion Control allows for smooth transitions between different action states, creating long, continuous takes. You can have a character walk, stop, look around, and then run, all seamlessly blended.\n\nEnsuring smooth, flicker-free motion in long-form videos is the hallmark of professional AI Motion Control. We eliminate the 'boiling' effect common in generative video, delivering broadcast-quality stability.\n\nProprietary algorithms to eliminate jitter and artifacts. By analyzing the optical flow between frames, our AI Motion Control engine corrects anomalies before they render. It acts as a digital stabilizer, smoothing out the noise inherent in diffusion models.\n\nSpecifically optimized for longer duration video generation. Most tools break down after 4 seconds. AI Motion Control maintains coherence for up to 60 seconds of continuous video without the character losing their identity or structural integrity.\n\nGenerate videos at 60fps or higher. AI Motion Control interprets the motion between frames to interpolate smooth motion, making your results broadcast-ready. Create slow-motion effects or crisp, realistic action sequences.\n\nOne of the toughest challenges in AI video is keeping the artistic style consistent while the subject moves. AI Motion Control solves this by decoupling motion from style modules.\n\nWhether your source image is an oil painting, a cyberpunk digital art piece, or a sketch, AI Motion Control ensures that the texture and brushstrokes move naturally with the character, rather than staying static like a screen overlay.\n\nAs your character moves through the virtual space, AI Motion Control calculates how the lighting should simulate on their changing geometry. Shadows wrap correctly, and highlights shift naturally, maintaining the 3D illusion of the 2D generation.\n\nKeep your background stable while your character moves. Our system identifies the subject and generates a clean plate for the background, preventing the warping and 'breathing' background issues seen in other tools.\n\nForget about expensive GPUs and complex installations. AI Motion Control delivers workstation-power directly to your browser through our optimized cloud infrastructure. Create without limits.\n\nCreate high-fidelity animations on any device, from a standard laptop to a tablet. We handle the compute-intensive diffusion processes on our enterprise-grade GPU clusters, freeing your machine from overheating and lag.\n\nDon't wait for one video to finish before starting the next. Our scalable architecture supports parallel processing, allowing you to run multiple motion experiments simultaneously. Iterate faster and find the perfect shot in a fraction of the time.\n\nOur cloud platform means you always have access to the latest AI Motion Control models and features the moment they are released. Say goodbye to managing local Python environments, installing dependencies, or downloading massive model weights.\n\nFrom social media viral hits to professional film production, AI Motion Control delivers the precision required for top-tier content.\n\nCreate high-end social media content and viral marketing campaigns. In the fast-paced world of TikTok and Instagram, stopping the scroll is everything. AI Motion Control allows brands to create eye-popping, impossible visuals that capture attention instantly. Imagine your mascot dancing perfectly to the latest trend, or your product assembling itself in mid-air. AI Motion Control makes this accessible without a Hollywood budget.\n\nProfessional film pre-visualization and character storyboarding. Directors can now visualize scenes with animated characters before a single camera starts rolling. AI Motion Control allows for rapid iteration of blocking and staging. Instead of stick figures or rough drawings, see your characters move and act in the actual environment, saving millions in production costs.\n\nDevelop realistic virtual influencers and digital brand ambassadors. The virtual human economy is booming, but stiff, robotic movement breaks the illusion. AI Motion Control gives your digital avatars lifelike movements and expressions, allowing them to connect with audiences authentically. Generate daily content for your virtual star without needing a motion capture suit every time.\n\nCreate personalized AI-driven dance and performance videos. Choreograph complex routines for your digital characters using simple reference videos. AI Motion Control excels at capturing the fluidity of dance, preserving the elegance of ballet or the snap of hip-hop, and applying it to any character you design.\n\nAccelerate asset creation for indie games. AI Motion Control can generate sprite sheet animations or cutscene videos from simple references, drastically reducing the animation workload for small teams.\n\nShowcase clothing on moving models without a photoshoot. AI Motion Control can take a flat image of a dress and a video of a model walking, and generate a video of the model wearing that dress, moving naturally.\n\nSelect the plan that best fits your creative needs. Unlock the full potential of AI Motion Control.\n\nEverything you need to know about our technology and how it helps you create better videos.\n\nJoin the revolution of precise AI video generation. Don't settle for randomness. Start creating lifelike animations today with the power of AI Motion Control.\n\nTrusted by professional creators worldwide",

    "fullText": "Traditional C tutorials teach habits that certification auditors reject\n\nEvery C programmer’s journey starts the same way:\n\nCompile. Run. Celebrate. You’re a C programmer now.\n\nExcept you’re not. You’ve just learned that C is a language where you type things and hope they work. That lesson - hope as a development strategy - will follow you through pointers, memory allocation, and eventually into production systems where hope gets people killed.\n\nThis isn’t hyperbole. The Therac-25 killed patients because of race conditions that “usually worked.” Knight Capital lost $440 million in 45 minutes because of code that “worked in testing.” The traditional C tutorial path doesn’t just fail to prepare engineers for safety-critical work - it actively teaches habits that certification auditors will reject.\n\nThe first line of most C tutorials introduces a function that violates nearly every principle of safety-critical software:\n\nprintf uses dynamic memory. The format string parsing, buffer management, and output handling all involve allocation patterns that cannot be statically analysed for worst-case behaviour.\n\nprintf has unbounded execution time. Depending on the format string, arguments, and output device, the same printf call can take microseconds or seconds. In a system with real-time constraints, this is unacceptable.\n\nprintf can fail silently. Most tutorials ignore the return value. In safety-critical systems, every function call must have its return value checked and its failure modes handled.\n\nprintf teaches output-first thinking. The programmer’s first instinct becomes “print something to see if it worked” rather than “prove it works before running it.”\n\nNone of this means printf is evil. It’s a useful debugging tool and perfectly appropriate for user-facing applications. The problem is that it’s the first thing we teach, and first lessons shape everything that follows.\n\nAfter “Hello World,” tutorials progress to dynamic memory:\n\nThis teaches several dangerous patterns:\n\nMemory size determined at runtime. The program cannot know its memory requirements until execution. Static analysis cannot prove memory bounds. The certifier cannot verify worst-case resource usage.\n\nAllocation can fail. And the tutorial’s “handle error… somehow” comment reveals that nobody really knows what to do when it does. In safety-critical systems, “somehow” isn’t a specification.\n\nManual lifetime management. The programmer must remember to free memory, in the right order, exactly once. Forget and you leak. Free twice and you corrupt. Use after free and you get undefined behaviour.\n\nHeap fragmentation is invisible. A program can run successfully for months, then fail when fragmentation finally prevents allocation. No amount of testing catches this reliably.\n\nFor safety-critical systems governed by DO-178C, IEC 62304, or ISO 26262, dynamic memory allocation is either prohibited entirely or requires extensive justification and analysis. Yet it’s the second thing we teach new C programmers.\n\nThe tutorial might mention this is “a bug,” but it doesn’t explain that this isn’t just wrong - it’s undefined. The C standard permits the compiler to do literally anything: crash, corrupt memory, send your browsing history to your employer, or appear to work perfectly until production.\n\n“Appears to work” is the most dangerous outcome. The off-by-one error might never manifest in testing because the memory after the array happens to be unused. Then in production, with different memory layout, the system fails in ways that cannot be reproduced or diagnosed.\n\nTraditional tutorials treat undefined behaviour as an edge case to avoid. Safety-critical development treats it as an existential threat to be eliminated by design.\n\nEngineers who transition to safety-critical domains discover that everything they learned needs to be unlearned. DO-178C Level A (for flight-critical avionics software) requires:\n\n100% code coverage. Every statement, every branch, every condition must be exercised by tests. Printf debugging doesn’t generate coverage data.\n\nTraceability. Every line of code must trace to a requirement, and every requirement must trace to tests that verify it. “It seemed like a good idea” isn’t traceable.\n\nStatic analysis. Tools must verify that code cannot exhibit undefined behaviour, exceed resource bounds, or enter unanalysable states. Malloc defeats most static analysers.\n\nDeterministic execution. Given the same inputs, the system must produce the same outputs. Always. Dynamic memory allocation introduces non-determinism through fragmentation and allocation timing.\n\nBounded resource usage. Memory, stack depth, and execution time must all have provable upper bounds. Recursion, dynamic allocation, and unbounded loops are prohibited or severely restricted.\n\nThe traditional tutorial path - printf, malloc, hope - is precisely what certification prohibits.\n\nThe approach taught in c-from-scratch inverts the traditional progression:\n\nInstead of starting with syntax and hoping correctness emerges, this methodology starts with correctness and derives syntax.\n\nBefore writing any code, define what problem you’re solving and what failure looks like. Not “I want to track a heartbeat” but “I need to detect when a periodic signal stops arriving within a bounded time, with no false positives during normal jitter and guaranteed detection of actual failures.”\n\nA heartbeat monitor can be expressed as a finite state machine with three states:\n\nThis isn’t pseudocode. It’s a mathematical specification that can be analysed for completeness (all state/input combinations handled), determinism (each combination has exactly one outcome), and termination (no infinite loops possible).\n\nFrom the state machine, we can prove:\n\nTotality: Every state has a defined transition for every input. There are no undefined cases.\n\nConvergence: From any state, the system eventually reaches either ALIVE (if pulses arrive) or DEAD (if they don’t).\n\nBounded memory: The state machine requires exactly one state variable and one timestamp. O(1) memory, provable statically.\n\nBounded time: Each transition is a constant-time operation. O(1) execution, provable statically.\n\nThese proofs exist before any C code is written.\n\nThe struct is not a convenient data container - it’s a physical encoding of the mathematical model:\n\nEvery field exists because the math requires it. There are no “might be useful later” fields. The struct is the state machine.\n\nImplementation becomes mechanical transcription of the mathematical specification:\n\nThis code contains no creativity. It’s a direct translation of the state machine. The creativity happened in the mathematical design, where it could be analysed and proven correct.\n\nTests don’t verify that the code “seems to work.” They verify that the mathematical contracts hold:\n\nEach test corresponds to a mathematical property. If the test fails, either the implementation is wrong or the proof was flawed. Either way, we know exactly what to fix.\n\nThe c-from-scratch framework standardises on a four-function interface for all safety monitors:\n\nStatic allocation. The caller provides memory. The module never allocates.\n\nDeterministic state transitions. All state changes happen in update(). Status queries are pure functions.\n\nComposability. Modules with identical interfaces can be combined, chained, and verified independently.\n\nTestability. Each function has clear preconditions and postconditions that tests can verify.\n\nThis isn’t an arbitrary convention. It’s the minimal interface that supports formal verification while remaining practical for real systems.\n\nThe math-first approach isn’t just for flight software. Consider:\n\nMedical devices: IEC 62304 Class C software (which can cause death or serious injury) has requirements similar to DO-178C. The same methodology applies.\n\nAutomotive: ISO 26262 ASIL-D (highest automotive safety level) requires similar rigour. Self-driving systems need provable behaviour.\n\nFinancial systems: Knight Capital’s $440 million loss came from code that “worked” until it didn’t. Deterministic, provable systems prevent this class of failure.\n\nInfrastructure: Power grids, water treatment, and industrial control systems increasingly require formal methods. The traditional tutorial path doesn’t prepare engineers for this work.\n\nEven in non-safety-critical domains, the discipline pays off. Code designed mathematically is easier to test, easier to maintain, and easier to reason about. The techniques scale down gracefully.\n\nThe first step is recognising that traditional C education optimises for the wrong thing. It optimises for “getting something working quickly” when it should optimise for “knowing why it works.”\n\nThe second step is accepting that correctness requires more upfront effort. Defining invariants before writing code feels slow. It is slow - initially. The time is recovered many times over during testing, debugging, and maintenance.\n\nThe third step is building new habits:\n\nThese habits feel awkward at first. Like all habits, they become automatic with practice.\n\nThe c-from-scratch repository provides a complete framework for learning this approach. Each module includes:\n\nStart with the Pulse module. It’s roughly 200 lines of code, but those 200 lines demonstrate every principle: closed state, total functions, bounded resources, deterministic execution.\n\nFor a structured learning path, “C From Scratch: Learn Safety-Critical C the Right Way” walks through the methodology from first principles, building toward a complete capstone project.\n\n“Hello World” isn’t wrong. It’s just the wrong starting point for engineers who will work on systems that matter.\n\nThe traditional C tutorial path teaches hope-based development: write code, run it, hope it works, debug when it doesn’t. This approach cannot produce software that meets safety certification requirements, and it builds habits that must be painfully unlearned.\n\nThe alternative - proving correctness before implementation - requires more discipline but produces code that can be trusted. When that code controls an aircraft, monitors a pacemaker, or manages a power grid, “can be trusted” isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s the entire point.\n\nAs with any methodology, suitability depends on context. Not every program needs formal verification. But every programmer benefits from understanding what formal verification requires - because it clarifies what “correct” actually means.\n\nHope is not a certification strategy. Mathematics is.\n\nWilliam Murray is a Regenerative Systems Architect with 30 years of UNIX infrastructure experience, specializing in deterministic computing for safety-critical systems.

    "description": "Senate Democrats say they won't vote for a bill to fund DHS after the deadly ICE shooting, threatening to imperil a broader government funding effort.",
    "fullText": "Just days ago, it looked like the US would avoid a repeat of the government shutdown that took place in the fall.\n\nThen, federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nIn the span of just a few hours following the shooting on Saturday, the odds that the government will shut down later this week rose from roughly 10% to the high 70s on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.\n\nThat's because Democratic senators now say they won't vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS — the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol — until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.\n\n\"What's happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. \"Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"\n\nThere are only two ways out of this:\n\nBut even if lawmakers go with the second option, a short shutdown through the weekend is likely.\n\nTo avoid a government shutdown after midnight late Friday evening, the Senate would need to pass the six-bill package, which funds DHS, the military, various government agencies, and a wide array of federal grants, among other things.\n\nThose six bills have already passed the House, and they've been stitched together into one larger package in the Senate.\n\nThe GOP may control the upper chamber, but they can't ignore Democrats. Due to the Senate's 60-vote \"filibuster\" rule, and the fact that Republicans hold just 53 seats, Democratic votes are necessary to advance most major bills, including this one.\n\nDemocrats are only opposed to the DHS bill, and Schumer has called on Republicans to work with Democrats to separate out the bills. But the GOP has balked so far at that idea.\n\nFurthermore, even if the bills are separated, the House would have to vote on them again to send them to President Donald Trump's desk.\n\nThe House is out of session until next week, meaning a shutdown at least until then is highly likely.\n\nJust months ago, the federal government shut down for 43 days, the longest shutdown in American history. There are a few reasons why this one wouldn't be as bad.\n\nFor one, it would only be a partial shutdown, because lawmakers have already passed several bills to fund the government through September 30.\n\nSNAP and WIC payments would be unaffected, Capitol Hill staffers would still get paid, and national parks would likely remain open.\n\nAdditionally, the path out of a shutdown is more straightforward.\n\nIn the fall, Democrats were demanding changes to healthcare while holding all of government funding back. This time, Democrats are only objecting to the DHS funding.\n\nThat means it's plausible that the Senate would separate out the other five bills, the House would re-pass those bills next week, and the partial shutdown would only last a few days.\n\nStill, the DHS bill doesn't just fund ICE and border patrol. It also funds the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThat raises the possibility of delays at airports and issues with disaster aid if the department goes unfunded for a long period of time.\n\nAdditionally, ICE will remain funded, even if the DHS bill doesn't pass for a long time.\n\nWhile the current DHS funding bill contains an additional $10 billion for ICE, the agency also received roughly $75 billion in funding via the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" in July.\n\nUnless lawmakers were to agree to rescind that funding — extremely unlikely given GOP control of Congress — that money's here to stay.",

    "description": "All seven new management committee members come from Goldman Sachs' growing asset and wealth management division, which oversees $3.6 trillion.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs just announced seven new power players it's vaulting to its most powerful echelon — and the fact that they all sit in the same division tells you something about where the bank is headed.\n\nThe firm's management committee — currently 41 members — is adding seven seats for partners the bank appointed on Monday. All sit within the asset and wealth management business, which holds $3.6 trillion in assets, offering a snapshot about who's gaining influence at the highest levels of 200 West Street.\n\nThe executives run businesses spanning private credit, public investing, alternatives, and wealth management.\n\n\"The opportunity to continue to grow our franchise across AWM is a core strategic objective for the firm, and this group of leaders will help us advance our goals,\" CEO David Solomon said in an accompanying statement.\n\nThe management committee is Goldman's most senior governing body, responsible for overseeing strategy, capital allocation, and top leadership decisions. Its members still meet weekly to set the bank's agenda.\n\nTwo longtime leaders are stepping down from the committee, the bank said — Vice Chairman Richard Gnodde and Asset Management Chairman Rich Friedman — bringing the new tally to 46 people who collectively steer the firm.\n\nThe new management committee members are:\n\nThe leadership updates also mean new roles for Mallory and Somaiya — both partners, who have spent more than 25 years each at Goldman, are currently leaders in the private banking group. Now, they'll assume the title of global co-heads of wealth management.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Goldman said private banking and lending revenue rose 16% in 2025, while assets under supervision across asset and wealth management climbed to a record $3.6 trillion, driven by management fees, lending activity, and client inflows.\n\nTheir appointments come as the bank steels itself for what it hopes will be a gangbuster year for business — maybe even rivaling storied 2021 levels.\n\nBut Goldman is also facing mounting competition from all corners of Wall Street — intensifying battles for clients and talent, and a more crowded market for private credit and wealth services.\n\nUnder Solomon's tenure, Goldman has spent several years pursuing a broader effort to grow its asset and wealth management business, making it a more well-rounded institutional investor active across multiple asset classes.\n\nIn late 2022, the firm moved Marc Nachmann, a former senior investment banker, into the role of running the merged Asset & Wealth Management division, combining them under the same roof. Since then, Goldman has worked to operate the businesses as one integrated platform, spanning public investing, private markets, private credit, and private wealth. Over the past three years, the business' collective assets under supervision have swelled more than $1 trillion from about $2.5 trillion at the end of 2022.\n\nAnd the bank has pursued a multi-year effort to connect those businesses through its One Goldman Sachs initiative, designed to encourage cross-collaboration and -pollination of commercial opportunities between bankers and financial advisors who can share the same clients and maximize profits.",

    "description": "Geopolitical tensions, Trump's tariff threats, and inflation fears have helped propel gold to $5,000 for the first time ever on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Gold is surging yet again, with the metal touching $5,000 an ounce on Monday for the first time ever.\n\nBehind the latest rally is the familiar cocktail of tailwinds that are bullish for gold, but less so for other parts of the market and the economy. The \"sell America\" trade is still getting a boost, inflationary concerns linger, and fears about geopolitical crises continue to percolate.\n\nHere are the latest updates on what's driving gold's parabolic rally to all-time highs.\n\nGold jumped more than 2% on Monday as trade tensions roil markets once again after Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if it strikes any sort of trade agreement with China.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nGold tends to play a \"flight-to-safety\" role in markets. When investors get scared about the economic consequences of Trump upending trade with key allies, they've often flocked to the metal for shelter.\n\nThe threatening rhetoric against allies like Canada and last week's sabre-rattling from Trump about taking over Greenland sparked a return of the \"Sell America\" trade, which has boosted gold over the last year.\n\nAs gold spiked to fresh highs on Monday, the dollar index fell almost 1% against major rivals to about $96.96.\n\nOccupying a similar place in investors' minds to \"Sell America\" is the debasement trade, which continues to boost metals like gold as markets fret about other safe havens such as Treasurys.\n\nGold bulls say that a weakening of the US dollar and other fiat currencies as governments pursue aggressive fiscal policies will boost more stable stores of value.\n\nTrump's ongoing pressure campaign against the Fed and Jerome Powell has been the latest update that has investors fretting over currency debasement and flocking to gold. The thinking is that political meddling with monetary policy and a dovish new Fed chair could lead to lower interest rates and spur a new period of inflation down the road. Gold has long been considered a hedge against rising prices among investors.\n\nThe debasement trade was a dominant theme in markets in 2025, and analysts have eyed it as a driver of bullish forecasts for 2026.\n\nAccording to Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX advisors, arguably the biggest driver in gold's outperformance over the last few years has been global central bank buying.\n\n\"After COVID, when America printed all this money, central banks — and it was led by China — quite literally doubled their annual purchases of gold, and they were selling Treasurys to do so,\" McMillan told Business Insider.\n\nCentral banks have also been trying to diversify their holdings away from US dollars, a trend that accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That prompted the US to freeze Russia's dollar reserves, drawing criticism over \"weaponization\" of the dollar and sparking more gold buying from countries like China.\n\nHeightened uncertainty is the heart of gold's bull case for many investors, and the geopolitical outlook looks shakier than it has in a long time.\n\nFrom Trump's moves in Venezuela, the ongoing war in Ukraine, turmoil in Iran, and a strained NATO alliance, gold bugs have a lot to worry about these days. As current conflicts stretch into 2026, analysts say they expect gold's safe-haven status to keep surging.\n\nFinally, the fear of missing out on a meme-like rally might be behind some of the moves. Gold is up 87% since the start of 2025, and has spiked 25% since October.\n\nThe gains are too good for some to watch from the sidelines.\n\nAs Business Insider reported, retail traders have been pouring money into gold recently, egged on by talk of the \"Sell America\" trade and an endless parade of bulls who say precious metals will keep rising.\n\nSilver is up even more than gold in the last year, and market pros told Business Insider that they worry the flight to safety itself has become a major investment bubble that could end badly for investors chasing the rally.",

    "title": "I went to graduate school in China and the US. I had more educational freedom in Hong Kong.",
    "description": "I studied music in both Hong Kong and the US. In China, I did most of my work on my own time and didn't need to meet many requirements.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with John von Seggern, founder of Futureproof Music School. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the 90s, the music scene in Asia was booming. I'm a bass player and jazz musician, and I was drawn to Japan in particular. Japanese people are known for being music lovers, and I enjoy their culture. It seemed like a good place to start a career.\n\nThere, I connected with a well-known artist in Hong Kong. I started touring Hong Kong and mainland China. After five big tours, I was tired. I've always loved studying, reading, and learning. I was dating a graduate student at the University of Hong Kong, and I thought that getting my master's degree would give me a much-needed break.\n\nI didn't need to pass any tests to get into the program; I just submitted a research proposal. My area of study — the intersection of music and the internet — was unique at the time, which I think helped me get in.\n\nThe University of Hong Kong follows a British model, which depends a lot on self-directed learning. I had a few small seminars during my roughly 18 months at the college, but most of my work was done on my own time. I'd meet with my advisor weekly, and then go off and do the reading and research he recommended.\n\nI received a fairly generous graduate school stipend in Hong Kong. It was enough to pay my rent and live on, and because of the relaxed time requirements, I could supplement my income by playing music gigs in the city.\n\nI was the only American in my program; most of the others were Chinese. There was a high regard for education in Hong Kong. Although it was unusual for a student to be in their 30s, people respected that I had returned to school.\n\nI did occasional work as a graduate assistant, and most of the undergrad students were Hong Kong natives. They were very disciplined and turned in top-quality work. Later, when I was a graduate assistant in the US, I was sad to see that my students' writing wasn't as strong as their Chinese counterparts.\n\nI really enjoyed being at the university, but I was getting concerned about the future of Hong Kong. The island was returned to China in 1997. During my travels, mainland China had always felt black and white, whereas Hong Kong was technicolor. Now, it felt that Hong Kong was beginning to fade. This was a big point of conversation among foreign faculty at the university.\n\nI decided to return to the US, just as lots of musicians settled in California. When I enrolled at the University of California, Riverside, I immediately noticed differences.\n\nTo begin with, the college didn't recognize most of the work I'd done in Hong Kong. I was able to bring my original research, but I didn't get credit for seminars, mostly because the British approach didn't equate easily with the American system.\n\nThe study in California was much more prescriptive, with required classes. At first, I didn't like that because I wanted to pursue my own intellectual interests. In hindsight, however, I was forced to learn a lot of fundamental knowledge that was beneficial.\n\nBeing in grad school in the US felt like a struggle to survive. I was expected to work more hours for a much smaller stipend — not even enough to cover rent. When I graded papers from undergrads, I was surprised when people handed in papers with obvious misspellings. It felt like a level of carelessness that I hadn't seen in Hong Kong.\n\nI wouldn't say that either China or the US was better for grad school; they were just two different approaches.\n\nUltimately, I'm glad I did both. The Hong Kong system was more personal, whereas the US system felt like boot camp, full of requirements I needed to meet.\n\nBoth experiences have benefited me in the years since. Although no one has ever asked me for my degree, the knowledge I gained in Hong Kong and Riverside has been really helpful.\n\nHave you attended college in both the US and China?

    "description": "Nvidia purchased $2 billion worth of CoreWeave shares as it expanded its partnership with the cloud company, which will use Nvidia chips.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is done with the questions about circular financing.\n\nHuang called it \"ridiculous\" to suggest that Nvidia's latest deal, a $2 billion investment in CoreWeave, is the latest circular deal between AI chipmakers and tech companies, a trend that has sparked some concern among some investors.\n\n\"These are generational companies — the investments that we make is confidence in them,\" Huang told Bloomberg News. \"But it's a small percentage of the amount of money that they ultimately have to go raise, and so the idea that it is circular is — it's ridiculous.\"\n\nAs part of the arrangement, Nvidia is expanding its previous investment in the cloud company by buying $2 billion worth of its shares. According to a joint statement, the money will assist CoreWeave's \"procurement of land, power, and shell to build AI factories.\" The future AI factories will then be powered by Nvidia's chips.\n\nHuang portrayed the latest deal and past arrangements with the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI as just a small portion of what the companies need to raise to finance their massive AI expansion plans. For example, OpenAI is committed to spending roughly $1.4 trillion over the next eight years, largely on data centers.\n\n\"Whatever we decide to invest is a small percentage, very small percentage of the overall amount of infrastructure, capital they're going to have to raise,\" Huang told CNBC in a separate interview.\n\nThis is far from the first time Nvidia has bristled at concerns about its deals.\n\nIn November, the world's largest company by market cap sent a letter to Wall Street analysts in response to investor Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame, who has questioned whether Nvidia was on solid financial footing.\n\n\"Nvidia's underlying business is economically sound, our reporting is complete and transparent, and we care about our reputation for integrity,\" the memo said.\n\nBurry has said he stands behind his analysis of the company, comparing it to one of Silicon Valley's giants before the Dotcom crash.\n\n\"I am not claiming Nvidia is Enron,\" he wrote on his Substack. \"It is clearly Cisco.\"",

Her mother, Amalija, worked at a local textile factory.\n\nTrump has one sister, Ines Knauss, and a half-brother, Denis Cigelnjak.\n\nMirjana Jelancic, a friend of Trump's who went on to become principal of the school, told ABC News in 2016 that the young Trump was \"an angel\" and \"a very good student.\"\n\nWhen Trump and her sister, Ines, were in high school, the Knavs family moved to Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital. There, Trump was scouted by photographer Stane Jerko and signed with a modeling agency when she was 18.\n\nTrump made the donation after her wedding in 2005, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump is the second first lady born outside the US. The first was John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa Catherine Adams, who was born in London.\n\nThe Rotary Klub Sevnica held events in honor of Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017 and 2025. Proceeds from the 2025 event went toward a youth scholarship fund, the Slovenian outlet Dolenjski List reported.\n\nA plaque at the site says the new bronze statue is \"dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Trump which stood in this location from 2019-2020.\"\n\nAt a 2023 naturalization ceremony held at the National Archives in Washington, DC, Trump said that becoming a US citizen is a \"life-altering experience that takes time, determination, and sometimes even tremendous strength.\" She also recalled navigating a \"labyrinth\" of paperwork to obtain a worker visa during her modeling career.\n\n\"I recall feeling a tremendous sense of pride and belonging after I recited the US oath of allegiance, as the pathway to citizenship is arduous,\" she said.",

    "description": "Ina Garten's smashed eggs on toast recipe only requires four main ingredients, but the beautiful breakfast dish is sure to impress.",
    "fullText": "To make this brunch dish, you'll need:\n\nGarten's recipe has very exact timing, so I decided to do my prep first so that I wouldn't get distracted.\n\nAll I had to do was mince the dill, which was ready in a flash.\n\nIt took a long time to get my water boiling, but my dad — who was patiently waiting for breakfast to be served — gave me some good tips. He recommended starting with hot water in the pan and noted that I had filled mine too much.\n\nHe also advised throwing in a bit of salt to speed up the process, which I did after dumping some of the water out.\n\nGarten is very specific in this part of her recipe: The eggs must cook for exactly six-and-a-half minutes — \"not six minutes and not seven minutes,\" she adds.\n\nThe \"Barefoot Contessa\" star said it's also essential to maintain a low simmer as the eggs cook, or they'll knock against each other and crack in the pan.\n\nI was paranoid about cracking my eggs during the cooking process, so I turned the heat down quite low. This turned into an issue a few minutes later.\n\nI once again used my trusty slotted spoon to get the eggs safely into the bowl, then set a timer for exactly two minutes — just as Garten instructed.\n\nAfter the slices were done toasting, I spread butter and mustard on each one.\n\nAnd I have to be honest with you, reader, I read the recipe incorrectly. I thought Garten recommended spreading half the slice with butter and half with mustard, which made for a cool picture, but that was definitely not the case.\n\nWhat she actually wants you to do is spread each slice with ½ tablespoon of butter and ½ teaspoon of mustard.\n\nThankfully, I really like mustard, so the extra flavor didn't put me off. Next time, though, I'll wait to read the recipe until after I've had a cup of coffee.\n\nAlso, a quick pro tip: Be sure to take your butter out of the fridge before you begin cooking your eggs. That way, it'll reach room temperature by the time you're ready to prep your toast, making it far easier to spread across the bread.\n\nGarten included a special trick for peeling eggs, and I wanted to follow her recipe to a T. So, per her instructions, I tapped the ends of my first egg on a cutting board to crack the shell.\n\nThen I rolled the middle of the egg on the board with the heel of my hand, which Garten said would \"crackle the shell.\" It quickly became apparent that my egg was a little too soft-boiled, because it immediately went SPLAT.\n\nI ran into this problem with a couple of the eggs and realized I must have turned the heat down too low. I had accidentally taken the \"smashed\" in Garten's smashed eggs on toast a little too literally.\n\nI placed one egg on each slice of toast and roughly chopped them without cutting into the bread so that it could absorb the runny yolks. Then I generously sprinkled dill on top of everything, along with some salt and freshly ground black pepper.\n\nDespite all my hiccups, Garten's smashed eggs on toast looked worthy of a weekend brunch and proved to be a delicious dish.\n\nI loved how the runny eggs paired with the crunchiness of the toasted bread, and the whole-grain mustard added a nice kick. The addition of dill made everything pop, elevating and brightening the flavors.\n\nEven with a couple of mistakes along the way, this dish was just another example of how the Barefoot Contessa's recipes are nearly foolproof.",

    "fullText": "A question for America's business leaders: Do you think that masked federal agents were right to shoot and kill protester Alex Pretti on a Minneapolis street on Saturday?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then no need to read further.\n\nFor the rest of you: If you are sickened by what you saw this weekend — say that. Out loud. And don't qualify it with \"both sides\" framing — just say that the thing that you saw, with your own eyes, is appalling.\n\nI understand why most of you have not said this yet. You have several reasons to be quiet.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not asking you to launch an ad campaign, or order up some performative Instagram posts, or any other kind of corporate theatre.\n\nJust say the thing you believe is right: It's wrong for masked federal agents to kill protesters in the streets, and that you condemn it.\n\nYou can go further if you'd like. Perhaps a call for the Trump administration to take accountability for its agents' actions. Maybe you can ask for a truly independent investigation into Pretti's killing. Whatever your conscience tells you.\n\nAnd yes, I know that it's easier for me to say this than for you to do it. There could be consequences for you and your companies when you speak out: Most people are appalled by Pretti's death, but not all of them.\n\nShortly after Pretti's death, Trump administration officials described him as a \"would-be assassin\" who \"wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\" — characterizations without evidence, but meant to justify Pretti's death. On Saturday, Trump posted a photo of a gun administration officials say was removed from Pretti, and argued that \"ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do!\" In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that the administration was \"reviewing everything\" about the shooting, but said that overall, his agents had done a \"phenomenal job\" in Minnesota.\n\nSo there could be real risk for you. But the bigger risk is silence.\n\nThat's because your silence tells everyone who is appalled by Pretti's death that they shouldn't speak up, either. That gives the federal government the tacit permission to carry on.\n\nSo say you're against that. Now. Before it stops shocking you.",

While doctors treated his visible injuries at the time, Ye said the neurological damage wasn't properly addressed.\n\n\"The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed,\" he wrote.\n\nThe apology also reveals that he is a Reddit user, with Ye writing that the online forum showed him that \"it's not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day.\"\n\n\"I have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places. Different people speak of being in manic or depressive episodes of a similar nature. I read their stories and realized that I was not alone,\" Ye said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Ye has apologized for his behavior, which became increasingly controversial in recent years and resulting in widespread backlash.\n\nHe's previously said he would go \"death con 3 on Jewish people,\" worn \"White Lives Matter\" shirts with Candace Owens, and last year recorded a song that chanted \"Heil Hitler.\" The actions likely contributed to him losing his place on Forbes' billionaires list, as brands like Adidas ended partnerships.\n\nHe's also made a habit of apologizing and then later backtracking and making continued antisemitic remarks.\n\nIn 2022, he issued an apology while comparing himself to George Floyd.\n\n\"It hurt the Black people,\" he said at the time. \"So I want to apologize for hurting them because right now God has shown me by what Adidas is doing, and by what the media is doing, I know how it feels to have a knee on my neck now.\"\n\nIn 2023, the rapper apologized to the Jewish community in an Instagram post, saying he was \"learning from this experience to ensure greater sensitivity and understanding.\"\n\nIn 2025, he publicly retracted his 2023 apology in a post on X and said he was a Nazi.",

The press release noted that Charles Edward Littlejohn, a former employee at the consulting firm, leaked the tax returns of thousands of taxpayers. The leak affected roughly 406,000 people, according to the IRS.\n\n\"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,\" Bessent said in the release.\n\nA company spokesperson said in a statement that it has \"consistently condemned in the strongest possible terms\" Littlejohn's actions, and has \"zero tolerance\" for breaking the law.\n\n\"When Littlejohn's criminal conduct occurred over 5 years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems. Booz Allen stores no taxpayer data on its systems and has no ability to monitor activity on government networks,\" the statement said. It added that the company supported the government's investigation, and that they \"look forward to discussing this matter with Treasury.\"\n\nLittlejohn pleaded guilty in 2023 to one count of unauthorized disclosure of tax return information and was sentenced to five years in prison last year, according to the New York Times.

    "fullText": "Though it's the fourth season of the Netflix series, Sophie and Benedict's story is actually the third book in Julia Quinn's \"Bridgerton\" series, and it's definitely worth reading if you haven't yet.\n\nIn the novel, the gentle reader finds Sophie at a crossroads. An illegitimate child, Sophie's biological father raised her as his ward, but after he died, her stepmother forced her to become a servant for herself and her two daughters. She finally gets the chance to be a proper lady of the ton for one night when she attends the Bridgerton masquerade ball in disguise. There, she crosses paths with Benedict Bridgerton, and they share an evening that will change both of them forever.\n\nTry as he might, Benedict can't forget the mystery woman he met at the masquerade, who disappeared without even telling him her name. He's been searching for her for years when he crosses paths with Sophie again — this time, when she is working as a maid — but he doesn't recognize her.\n\nHer familiarity nags at Benedict, but he soon finds himself drawn to the Sophie he knows now. Their relationship seems impossible because of their social standings and because of the piece of his heart that still belongs to his mysterious masquerade woman, but true love always finds a way.\n\nA \"Cinderella\" retelling full of longing and forbidden love, \"An Offer from a Gentleman\" showcases Quinn at her finest.\n\n\"Bringing Down the Duke\" is the first installment in Evie Dunmore's \"A League of Extraordinary Women\" series.\n\nIt follows Annabelle Archer, one of the first women admitted to the University of Oxford in 1879. Annabelle is a scholarship student, and her financial support depends on her commitment to recruiting influential men to join the suffragette movement.\n\nAnnabelle doesn't know how she'll convince Sebastian Devereux, the Duke of Montgomery, to help her cause. His support is crucial because he directly influences the Queen's policies, but the removed Sebastian is more interested in finding a suitable wife than in women's rights.\n\nWorst of all, neither Annabelle nor Sebastian expected the palpable attraction between them, threatening to derail everything they were both working toward. They'll have to see which is more powerful: their goals or their feelings for each other.\n\nIf you love the ensemble cast of \"Bridgerton,\" Krystal Marquis' \"The Davenports\" is the perfect addition to your to-be-read list.\n\nInspired by the true story of Charles Richard Patterson, Marquis' novel follows the family of William Davenport, a previously enslaved man who became a successful business owner with the Davenport Carriage Company. By 1910, his family is wealthy and secure, and his children — particularly his daughters Olivia and Helen — have become fixtures of high society.\n\nWhen \"The Davenports\" begins, Olivia is set on marrying a suitable match until she finds herself drawn to Washington DeWight, a civil rights activist, while Helen can't stop thinking about the man who is supposed to be courting her sister, Jacob Lawrence. Meanwhile, the girls' former close friend and current maid, Amy-Rose, and Olivia's best friend, Ruby, end up in a love triangle with John Davenport, Olivia and Helen's charming brother, until Ruby falls for someone she never anticipated.\n\nFull of heart and no shortage of romance, the first installment of \"The Davenports\" series will scratch the same itch as \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" Diana Gabaldon's historical romance \"Outlander\" became a successful TV series, but unlike Quinn's works, her nine-book series comes with a side of magic.\n\nWhen \"Outlander\" begins, former combat nurse Claire Randall is trying to find her footing after the end of World War II in 1945. In an attempt to find a new normal, Claire and her husband Frank visit the Scottish Highlands, but a walk through a stone circle sends Claire back in time to 1743, when war was the backdrop of Scotland.\n\nClaire is desperate to return to her life, but to stay alive, she is forced to marry the surprisingly kind warrior, Jamie Fraser. As time passes, her reluctant marriage to Jamie becomes a passion Claire has never known. Will she return to her life in the future or take on an adventure in the past she never expected?\n\nKJ Charles' \"The Magpie Lord\" has all the aristocratic fun of \"Bridgerton\" with the added flair of dark magic.\n\nIt's been two decades since Lucien Vaudrey set foot in London following his exile to China. When his father and brother suddenly die, Lucien has to return to a life he never expected as the new Lord Crane.\n\nHowever, his earldom comes with the same adversaries his father had, leaving Lucien in danger of nefarious magic. He enlists the help of Stephen Day, a magician who can't stand the Crane family, to help him.\n\nStephen expects to loathe Lucien as he did his relatives, but to his surprise, Lucien is relaxed, tattooed, and clearly wants him. As Stephen's feelings for Lucien deepen, evil continues to invade the lord's home, putting them both at risk.\n\nAmanda Briars decides to take her sexuality into her own hands in \"Suddenly You\" by Lisa Kleypas.\n\nAs a 30th birthday gift to herself, author and spinster Amanda decides to seek out a male companion so she can experience intimacy. So when Jack Delvin, a publisher who wants to work with her, appears on her doorstep, she assumes he's there for a very different reason, leading to a night of passion neither anticipated.\n\nAfter their encounter, Amanda and Jack still have to work together, and neither can ignore their attraction. Will their different backgrounds keep them apart, or will love bring them together?\n\nIf you want a romance like \"Bridgerton\" with a touch of darkness, \"The Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels\" by India Holton will hit the spot.\n\nAlthough Cecilia Bassingwaite appears to be a demure Victorian woman, she's actually a thief. She uses her societal standing to swindle goods from England's upper class as a member of the Wisteria Society of Lady Scoundrels.\n\nAssassin for hire Ned Lightbourne is tasked with taking Cecilia out for his boss, Captain Morvath, but everything changes when Ned lays eyes on her.\n\nCecilia and Ned have no choice but to work together to save the Wisteria Society from Morvath's wrath — drawing them closer and closer together.\n\nIn \"Rebel\" by Beverly Jenkins, Valinda Lacy is building a new life for herself in Reconstruction-era New Orleans.\n\nOriginally from New York City, Valinda has big dreams of helping rebuild the city, but her hopes are dashed when ruffians make a target of her and the school she created.\n\nArchitect Captain Drake LeVeq steps in to help Valinda and is immediately smitten with her. Drake finds everything about Valinda alluring, especially her independence, so he's devastated to learn she has a responsible fiancé waiting for her in New York.\n\nThe more time Val spends in New Orleans with Drake, the less she wants to return to the life set out for her.\n\nThe first installment of Jenkins' \"Women Who Dare\" series, \"Rebel,\" is exciting and steamy.\n\nThe first installment in Tessa Dare's \"Girl Meets Duke\" series is \"The Duchess Deal,\" a perfect story for fans of the marriage-of-convenience trope.\n\nThe Duke of Ashbury rarely leaves his home after the war, hiding the burns and scars he took home with him. However, he needs to have a child, so he has to get married.\n\nWhen his fiancée abruptly pulls out of the wedding, and he spots his seamstress, Emma Gladstone, with the dress in hand, he gets Emma to agree to step in and become the duchess.\n\nThe duke plans to keep Emma at arm's length, only visiting her bed at night to produce an heir. That won't work for Emma, though, who insists they dine together every night. And the longer Emma is in the Duke of Ashbury's world, the more enamored she is.\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" Liana De la Rosa's \"Ana María and the Fox\" takes place during a society season in Victorian London.\n\nMexican heiress Ana María Luna Valdés ends up in London with her sisters when the French occupy her home country, giving her the chance to see what life is like when she isn't under her father's watchful eye. She can't help but notice Gideon Fox, a politician with ambitious plans to bring an end to the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nGideon is sure he doesn't have time for a romance with anyone, no matter how alluring he finds Ana. To his dismay, he has no choice but to protect her when a rival politician makes advances on her — nor does he have a choice in the feelings he develops for her.\n\nIf you like the class tension in \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" Quinn's \"A Night Like This\" might be right up your alley.\n\nThe second novel in the \"Smythe-Smith Quartet\" follows Anne Wynter, the governess for three cousins in the Smythe-Smith family (who will be familiar to fans of \"Bridgerton\"). Being a governess isn't her dream job, but it works for Anne, especially since it helps her keep her real identity private.\n\nAnne is hopeful she can maintain her low profile until Daniel Smythe-Smith, the Earl of Winstead, returns to town, and he immediately sets his sights on her. Anne has had no trouble resisting men in the past, but there's something about Daniel that stirs feelings in her she never anticipated.\n\nWhen enemies from Daniel's past threaten not only him but Anne, he'll show her just how far he's willing to go to protect her.\n\nLike \"Bridgerton,\" the \"Bedwyn Saga\" follows a rambunctious family, and the first installment, \"Slightly Married,\" focuses on the second eldest son, Aidan Bedwyn.\n\nAidan might look tough, but underneath it all, the colonel has a soft heart. That warmth leads him to visit Ringwood Manor after one of his soldiers died, determined to care for the man's sister in his stead.\n\nInstead of finding a grieving, helpless woman, he meets Eve, an enchanting and fearless woman who quickly makes clear that Aidan's help is the last thing she wants. However, when Aidan offers to marry her so she can keep her home, Eve feels she has no choice but to accept.\n\nAlthough Aidan is immediately drawn to Eve, the pair agree to a loveless marriage, but one kiss may undo everything they had planned.",

    "fullText": "Hedge-fund billionaire Bill Ackman donated $10,000 to the family of the second person killed by immigration officers in Minnesota after being urged to by an activist.\n\nA GoFundMe page set up after Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis nurse, was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday shows Ackman is the top donor.\n\nAckman was called to donate by Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, in a post on X. She cited his earlier donation to a fundraiser for Jonathan Ross, an ICE officer involved in the fatal shooting of Renee Good: \"This family could use the $10,000 you donated to Renee Good's killer,\" Watts wrote on X. \"Please donate.\"\n\nAckman responded less than five hours later, confirming that he'd made a donation to the GoFundMe, which is titled \"Alex Pretti is an American Hero.\"\n\nDone. That said, I don’t agree with the gofundme that he is an American hero, but his loss is tragic for him and his family.\n\n\"Done. That said, I don't agree with the gofundme that he is an American hero, but his loss is tragic for him and his family,\" Ackman said in his post.\n\nEarlier this month, after he donated to the Ross fundraiser, Ackman said he also attempted to donate to Good's GoFundMe, but it was closed. He said his support \"was not to make a political statement.\"\n\n\"I supported Ross because I knew he would need significant funds to cover his defense costs. I supported the gofundme for Good's family as I thought that it was the right thing to do,\" he wrote then.\n\nThe GoFundMe for Pretti's family has raised over $1 million as of Monday morning, with more than 29,000 donations. His father, Michael Pretti, is listed as the beneficiary of the funds.\n\nAckman is one of several business leaders to call for calm in the aftermath of clashes between protesters and ICE agents in Minneapolis. He published a statement to X on Saturday, urging Americans to \"take a deep breath and reserve judgment before this gets even more out of control.\"\n\nLast week, Pretti's family said they're \"heartbroken but also very angry\" over the killing in a written statement, multiple outlets reported.\n\n\"Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman,\" his family said in the statement.",

    "description": "LPL Financial's Adam Turnquist forecasts a 20% rally for energy as the sector breaks above a key resistance level and macro tailwinds build.",
    "fullText": "Bad weather and geopolitical turmoil have boosted the energy sector to the top of the stock market leaderboard in 2026, and there could be stronger gains to come.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy sector is up more than 10% in 2026, handily outpacing the 1% gain in the broader index. Temperatures have plummeted across the US, raising the outlook for energy demand, while geopolitical tensions have increased the risk to supply.\n\nAdam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at wealth management firm LPL Financial, says there are technical signals flashing in the sector that point to gains piling up from here.\n\n\"Technically, the energy sector has finally cleared resistance off the 2014 and 2024 highs, checking the box for a breakout from its multi-year range,\" Turnquist wrote, adding that the sector could rally another 20% from current levels.\n\n\"From a near‑term perspective, energy appears overbought, making a retracement to the prior breakout level a reasonable expectation,' Turnquiest told Business Insider. \"That area should serve as an important test for the bulls. A successful retest would reinforce the breakout thesis, while a failure to find support would increase the risk of a false breakout.\"\n\nWhile crude oil has steadily declined in the last year on outlooks for heavy supply and uncertain demand, energy markets recently have been boosted by a brutally cold winter in the US and potential disruptions to crude flows amid geopolitical tensions. Commentators have warned of the potential for oil shocks that could send energy prices surging.\n\nTurnquist noted that he thinks oil futures will need to top $62.25, up from their current price of $60.94, in order for the boom in the energy sector to feel sustainable. While it hasn't proven a lasting recovery yet, that type of strength would add to the bull case.\n\n\"For WTI crude, the 200-day moving average near $62.25 will be a big test, as it also overlaps with a prior intra-day high registered earlier this month,\" he said. \"A breakout above this area would raise the probability of the cycle low being reached near $55 but technical evidence suggests it would be too early to call make the call that an uptrend is underway.\"",

    "description": "\"The Big Short\" investor wrote on his Substack on Monday that he's been buying the OG meme stock, causing shares to jump during the session.",
    "fullText": "Michel Burry says he's betting on the market's most famous meme stock.\n\nThe investor, best known for his role in Michael Lewis's financial crisis saga \"The Big Short,\" said on Monday that he's been buying shares of GameStop, one of the original and most famous meme stocks.\n\nBurry announced his position in a post on his Substack, Cassandra Unchained, on Monday. It sent shares of the video game retailer up as much as 6%.\n\nRather than betting on a new bout of meme-stock mania to send the stock higher, Burry said his investment is a long-term play. This isn't Burry's first time dabbling in the OG meme stock. In an earlier Substack post, he discussed his decision to offload his position in the company weeks before the short squeeze of 2021. In his follow-up on Monday, Burry revealed he owns GameStop again and has been buying shares recently and that he sees significant growth potential with Ryan Cohen as CEO.\n\n\"I expect I am buying at what may soon be 1x tangible book value / 1x net asset value,\" he said. \"And getting a young Ryan Cohen investing and deploying the company's capital and cash flows. Perhaps for the next 50 years.\"\n\nThat may sound like a long window for growth, particularly given GameStop's history as a meme stock that's often driven more by hype than fundamentals. Burry acknowledged that his bet may come across as unorthodox but backed it up with more analysis in his post.\n\n\"That is not a common occurrence in the U.S. stock market today,\" he wrote. \"With the downside protected by its tangible asset value, being long GameStop is almost as asymmetric as it gets these days in U.S. common stocks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Burry said he sees solid potential for a turnaround under Cohen. The CEO and founder of online pet supply company Chewy is a popular figure among retail traders.\n\n\"I am not counting on a short squeeze to realize long-term value,\" Burry said.\n\n\"I believe in Ryan. I like the setup, the governance, the strategy as I see it. I am willing to hold long-term, and I am excited to see where this goes. I am fifteen years his senior, but not too old to be patient.\"\n\nBurry's bullishness spurred a jump in GameStop on Monday, though it didn't spill over to other meme stocks. Data from retail trading activity platform ApeWisdom shows that retail traders have been highly focused on GameStop since Burry announced his position, but other favorites like AMC and Koss haven't entered the spotlight.",

    "description": "A mom in Maine shares how a viral Instagram video inspired her family to turn a kids' climbing structure into a DIY igloo. And it cost $0.",
    "fullText": "Years ago, we bought a geodesic climbing structure for my three kids, who were all under 5. We thought it would keep them entertained all year long without our supervision, but the reality could not be more different. The structure sat untouched through the seasons.\n\nOn Sunday, while preparing for the massive snowstorm that was headed toward Maine, Instagram fed me a reel of a couple building an igloo with the same climbing structure we have. I sent it to my husband, who came running from the room next door and said, \"We have to do this!\"\n\nIt turned out to be a hit with the kids, and it was surprisingly easy to pull off.\n\nThe video I watched showed the first step to making the igloo is wrapping the perimeter of the climbing structure tightly with plastic wrap.\n\nWe opted for a more eco-friendly option and decided to use king-size bed sheets. My husband had the idea to soak them in water first so they wouldn't blow away in the strong wind as we were prepping the igloo. We soaked them in a tub and carried them outside quickly. The temps in Maine were in the teens, so we had to drag the sheets across the climbing dome quickly. I was actually surprised at how quickly the sheets hardened in the cold air. We just wrapped the ends of the sheet around a pole and didn't need anything else to secure it in place.\n\nWe covered the entire structure, leaving one small triangle so the kids could crawl in and out of it, and had the rest of the dome totally covered.\n\nWe had tried something similar years earlier, and the sheets never hardened enough to stay on the dome. I didn't want to get my hopes up this time around, so we left the sheets and walked over to a friends' house to play before the snow.\n\nWe were back home when the storm had already started, and we could see snow accumulating on the dome. I really wanted to check on it regularly because I was worried the weight of the snow would collapse the igloo's roof. But I'm from Argentina, and I don't do well in negative temperatures, so I let it be and decided to check it in the morning.\n\nWe got absolutely dumped with snow overnight; it was the biggest snowstorm I've experienced since moving to Maine 6 years ago. And to my surprise, the igloo worked.\n\nImmediately, my kids were excited to climb inside, even exclaiming that it was way warmer in the igloo than outside it. They called over friends and neighbors, and they all played inside the igloo while I worked and my husband snowblowed around our house.\n\nIt's the first time that I copied something from a viral reel or TikTok video, and it really paid off. And the best part is that it costs us nothing.\n\nNext time we get a snowstorm warning, I at least know which sheets to pull out ASAP so we can start building quickly.",

    "fullText": "Sportswear giant Nike is set to cut hundreds of jobs as it consolidates its US distribution center operations.\n\nThe company said it plans to let go of 775 employees across Tennessee and Mississippi, citing efforts to \"streamline\" operations. Nike operates warehouses in both states.\n\n\"We are sharpening our supply chain footprint, accelerating the use of advanced technology and automation, and investing in the skills our teams need for the future,\" Nike said in a statement to Business Insider on Monday.\n\nThe move is a part of CEO Elliott Hill's larger comeback plan, known as the \"win now\" strategy, which aims to return Nike's revenue to growth. Hill took over the sportswear giant in October 2024 as it faced significant challenges, including declining sales and increased pressure from rivals.\n\nNike made previous cuts in 2024 and last year, reducing its corporate workforce by 1% in 2025 as part of its realignment plan under Hill. The senior leadership team also saw a shake-up in 2025, with Nike eliminating the chief technology officer and chief commercial officer roles, among other changes.\n\nIn its statement, Nike said it's taking steps to move faster, serve consumers better, and reduce the complexity of its operations footprint. The company had about 77,800 employees worldwide as of May.\n\nThe latest cuts come as concerns that AI will replace human workers grow stronger, with companies like HP and Amazon citing AI-related efficiency as a factor in recent workforce reductions. A recent study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that AI's skills overlap with over 11.7% of the US labor market.\n\nThe company said it expects the reduction to support its \"path back to long-term, profitable growth.\"",

    "fullText": "The United States could alter its decades-old North American Aerospace Defense Command deal with Canada should its government backtrack on the purchase of 88 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, the U.S. ambassador to Canada has warned.\n\nIn the latest back-and-forth between the U.S. and Canada over the deal, Ambassador Pete Hoekstra cautioned that if Canada purchased fewer fighter jets, the U.S. would “fill those gaps” in security concerns.\n\nThat could mean the U.S. would need to purchase more F-35 fighter jets for its own use and use them to intervene in Canadian airspace more frequently.\n\nUnder the current terms of NORAD, the U.S. and Canada can operate in one another’s airspace to track or intercept threats. However, Hoekstra indicated U.S. intervention would go even further, should the fighter jet deal change, thus requiring new terms to the Cold War-era agreement.\n\n\"NORAD would have to be altered,\" Hoekstra told CBC News.\n\nHoekstra’s comments come months after the Canadian government indicated it was “reviewing” the terms of the fighter jet deal after finding the program to be costlier than expected.\n\nIn 2022, Canada agreed to purchase 88 F-35A advanced fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, with the country initially committing to funding 16 deliverable jets.\n\nBut quickly, the program ran into challenges. Not only has it taken longer than anticipated to manufacture the jets, but a 2025 initial audit of the deal found that the program had risen to $27.7 billion in cost – up from its initial $19 billion.\n\nWith tensions between the U.S. and Canada increasing due to President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called for the review.\n\nNow, Canadian officials are reportedly looking to other countries to supply it with fighter jets, including Saab, the Swedish aerospace and defense company that creates the JAS 39 Gripen E fighter. Saab has offered to manufacture the jets in Canada, creating 12,600 jobs.\n\n\"The government is interested in all major projects that can not only protect Canada's security and sovereignty, but also create jobs across the country,\" Mélanie Joly, the Minister of Industry, told CBC News.\n\n\"We certainly can't control President Trump, but … we can control our defense investments, who we award contracts to and how we are ultimately able to create jobs in Canada. So we're going to focus on that.\"\n\nBut Hoekstra warned that if Canada chooses to purchase Saab’s Gripen E jets, the U.S. would still need to reconsider how it works with it’s northern neighbor on security.\n\n\"If they decide they’re going with an inferior product that is not as interchangeable, interoperable as what the F-35 is, that changes our defense capability,” Hoekstra said.\n\n“And as such, we have to figure out how we're going to replace that,” the ambassador added.\n\nHoekstra’s warning is the latest attempt by a U.S. official to pressure another country to comply with the administration’s desires, specifically those related to national security. It comes on the heels of Trump threatening to impose tariffs on European allies for not supporting a U.S. deal to acquire Greenland.",

(AP) — As a deadly storm that brought crippling ice to the South and deep snow to the Northeast finally began to swirl out to sea Monday, it represented light at the end of the tunnel for some.\n\nBut thousands of Americans were still without power or heat, and temperatures were forecast to plunge well below freezing by early Tuesday in areas where the ice storm did its worst damage.\n\nMore than 800,000 power outages were reported nationwide Monday morning, with more than 150,000 of them in the Nashville, Tennessee, area, according to poweroutage.com. About 140,000 remained without power in hard-hit Mississippi, and 115,000 \n\nAfter a sleepless night in Iuka, Mississippi, Adrian Ronca-Hohn said he awoke Monday to what looked \"like a war zone.”\n\n“We couldn’t go 10 seconds without hearing what sounded like a gunshot,\" the 23-year-old football coach said of falling trees and branches. “You’d hear a pop, a hard pop, and you’d hear the whistle of it falling, and then it would crash to the ground and just kind of explode.”\n\nAs temperatures across the South are expected to reach their coldest this week early Tuesday morning, people without power are trying to survive.\n\n“We have a lot of people without heat, without power and without water,\" Ronca-Hohn said. We have a lot of mobile homes down here that aren’t very well-insulated.\"\n\nHere's a look at the storm by the numbers.\n\nOne inch of ice (2.5 centimeters) recorded in multiple communities across Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama, and South Carolina.\n\nThe temperature in Fahrenheit (minus 17 Celsius) that’s expected early Tuesday morning in Tennessee’s capital city, where thousands remain without power.\n\nInches of sleet (17 centimeters) that fell at Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas, according to preliminary totals.\n\nThe number of days it could take to restore power in Allen County, Kentucky, city officials said.

    "description": "Internal builds seem to be adding blur across all of Android 17.",
    "fullText": "When Apple introduced Liquid Glass to the public in June of last year, it kicked off a saga that's still ongoing. The company's toned down the effect multiple times, and in November, it added controls for tinting it. Some have even found out ways to disable Liquid Glass entirely. It's not a quagmire I'd jump into willingly, but apparently, that's exactly what Android's about to do.\n\nAccording to \"images of internal builds\" seen by 9to5Google, Android's next update will add significant amounts of blur \"across Android 17.\"\n\n\"Throughout the OS, you can expect a system UI that switches from solid light or dark backgrounds to a blur effect that allows you to see what's immediately behind the component you're interacting with,\" writes 9to5Google's Abner Li.\n\nThat sounds a lot like Liquid Glass to me, and Li further confirms that elements like the volume bar and mode switcher will be translucent, allowing you to see your wallpaper and app icons in the background.\n\nThis actually isn't Google's first time experimenting with transparency effects. In Android 16 QPR1, Google already added blur to the notification and quick settings panels. What's new is that we can now expect it in other parts of the OS as well, for a more cohesive look. So if it hasn't bothered you yet, you don't need to worry about opening your phone on Android 17's release date and seeing a brand new interface.\n\nLi also says that \"Compared to Liquid Glass on iOS, Android's new look is more subtle,\" although some are likely to be more sensitive to it than others.\n\nPersonally, I haven't noticed the blur that's already there much, but even if you don't mind the aesthetic, the effect can be a slight drain on battery life. Luckily, even before it's been introduced across the OS at large, there's a way to turn off blur in Android.\n\nThis came in Android QPR2, specifically as a response to the new effects (although it was technically available in developer options before then). To do this, open your Settings app, and then navigate to Accessibility > Color & Motion. From there, tap on Reduce blur effects. The change will take place immediately, so you'll be able to test then and there which look you prefer.\n\nLike other new Android features, the blur is likely to come to Pixels first, and because Google's branding it as part of its own Material 3 Expressive design language, it might not make the jump to Samsung Galaxy or other Android phones. The exception could be in Google-branded apps, although Li said \"it remains to be seen\" whether Google will add blur to its apps in addition to the OS.",

    "description": "Threat actors love to imitate well-known tech and social media companies.",
    "fullText": "Impersonation scams are everywhere: bad actors are constantly trying to convince you that they represent organizations like LinkedIn, PayPal, your bank, the FBI, the FTC, and the IRS as they look to steal your money and information. When it comes to phishing schemes, which typically try to trick you into handing over sensitive data or account credentials via malicious links, tech brands are (perhaps not surprisingly) among the most commonly spoofed.\n\nA recent report from Check Point Research found that Microsoft was imitated in nearly a quarter of all branded phishing attempts in Q4 of last year—nearly double the next most-impersonated company.\n\nAccording to researchers, tech companies and social networks are consistently among the most popular brands for impersonators running phishing scams, with the following share in the final quarter of last year:\n\nWhile you should always be on guard for common phishing tactics, it's wise to be especially wary of unsolicited communication from any of the companies listed—especially if that communication is related to account security and/or urges you to click a link. We've covered at least one campaign involving nearly every brand here, all of which are known and largely trusted among users, making them prime targets for these types of scams. Check Point notes that stolen Microsoft and Google credentials are particularly valuable because they're widely used in day-to-day workflows.\n\nBroadly speaking, a phishing scam starts with an email, text, or social media message that appears to be from a legitimate source. It likely asks you to update or verify personal information—often related to a payment or account security—with a link to what appears to be the company's website or login page. Of course, this link leads instead to a spoofed version of that site designed to harvest your credentials, credit card number, bank details, or other personal data, which scammers can then use for identity theft, account takeover, or purchase fraud.\n\nNote that while the above methods are among the most common, phishing can also happen via phone call, voicemail, and malicious browser pop-ups.\n\nAs we mentioned, just because you generally trust a company doesn't mean you should blindly trust all communication from it. If you receive a message that is unprompted, sounds urgent, and is unrelated to any recent action on your part (such as a login attempt or bill payment), do not engage with it. Don't click any links, open any attachments, or respond directly. Look out for typos and other errors, including the original sender—though as scammers have found ways to appear verified, this isn't always an obvious red flag.\n\nIf you're unsure about the contents of the message, go directly to the website or app and log in to see any legitimate alerts. A password manager offers an extra layer of security here, as it'll protect you from entering credentials on a spoofed page.\n\nFinally, enable a strong, phishing-resistant form of multi-factor authentication everywhere you can, and especially for high-use and high-value accounts like Microsoft and Google. If your credentials are compromised, threat actors won't have that additional factor to utilize them.",

    "fullText": "If you tried hopping on TikTok Sunday, you might have noticed something odd: the app wasn't working. Outages happen, of course, as anyone who has Verizon can attest. But in the moment, theories were flying left and right. TikTok had just officially moved into U.S. control, leading some to speculate that the outage had something to do with this change in ownership. As one user put it, \"TikTok being down days after the people they were forced to sell to take it over does not feel like a coincidence.\"\n\nAs it happens, it does appear that the changing of the guard was responsible for the outage—just not in the way that some conspiracy theories might suggest. TikTok finally released a statement on X Monday morning, attributing the outage to issues at a U.S. data center. The statement is as follows: \"Since yesterday we’ve been working to restore our services following a power outage at a U.S. data center impacting TikTok and other apps we operate. We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon.\"\n\nFor its part, TikTok is very much operational at the moment. If the issue really was just isolated to a power outage at this data center, that data center appears to have patched things up. But that doesn't mean the company's reputation is patched up. Users are accusing the app's new owners of changing the algorithm, complaining of reset For You Pages, irrelevant content in feeds, and AI-generated content. I've seen users accuse the app of blocking anti-Trump and anti-ICE content, while comedian Gianmarco Soresi says even some of his non-political TikToks have \"zero views,” which he attributes to the ineffectiveness of the people running the app. (I've reached out to TikTok for comment on user reports of changes to the algorithm and will update if I hear back.)\n\nWe'll need more time to know whether or not there were serious changes made to TikTok's algorithm and user feeds in the wake of this sale. But the app is running—at least, for now.",

    "title": "10 Treadmill Hacks Every Runner Should Know",
    "description": "\"Never stop innovating\" applies to how I stretch my calves.",
    "fullText": "I'm something of a treadmill hater. When I do hop on one, it's only during times when it's truly unsafe to run outdoors. I know that the treadmill brings all the same physical benefits as running outside (because no, it is not “cheating” on your workout). However, I mourn all the mental perks of spending time outside. That's why it's necessary for me to use whatever mental tricks I can to transform a monotonous slog into an actually enjoyable workout. The best part? None of these require special equipment or significant time investment—just small, smart adjustments to your routine. Whatever reason you have for running indoors, here's how to make the most of your time on the treadmill.\n\nThe treadmill isn't necessarily easier, but it can sure feel easier. There's a pervasive myth that the treadmill “moves your feet” and thus makes running easier, but that’s not true.\n\nHowever, if you do happen to be running at a pace of 7:30 per mile (8.0 mph) or faster, setting the treadmill’s incline to 0.5% or 1% is recommended to mimic outdoor air resistance. For those of us slower than that, the difference is so small as to be meaningless.\n\nEven though I'm not fast enough for it to be an issue, I like to set my treadmill's incline to 1% because it keeps me engaged mentally. It really is a minor change, and even if it's \"unnecessary,\" I appreciate the small challenge to make things feel less boring.\n\nIn my experience, gym fans are unreliable. Overheating is one of the main reasons people quit treadmill workouts early. Indoor running means no natural breeze, so your temperature rises faster than it would outside.\n\nIf you can't find a treadmill with a solid fan nearby (or built-in), use your own portable fan. I like to set it up to hit me at chest level. Trust me, the same effort feels way easier when you're not overheating.\n\nStaring at the console could be killing your running form. When you look down at the display, your neck tilts forward, your shoulders round, and your stride shortens.\n\nInstead, pick a spot on the wall ahead of you—roughly the same spot you'd look at when running outside. Check your stats with quick glances rather than sustained staring. A lot of the times, I cover the display with a towel during speed work to avoid the temptation. Your posture will improve dramatically, and you might find running feels more natural.\n\nThe purpose of your treadmill run is to mimic natural walking and running strides as best you can. Holding onto the handrail can throw that off. Using the handrails transfers the workload meant for your legs and core into your upper body. If you feel the need to hold onto the handrails, it’s not the end of the world. But if it makes your workout significantly easier, think about what that likely means for the amount of work you’re putting into—and getting out of—your run.\n\nI love crafting a playlist that also works as a pacing mechanism. Songs have a tempo measured in beats per minute (BPM), and your running cadence (steps per minute) responds subconsciously to music tempo.\n\nAlthough there is no single “perfect” cadence, most runners fall around 160-180 steps per minute. Match your playlist to your target pace: slower songs for warm-ups and recovery, 150-160 BPM for easy runs, and 170-180 BPM for tempo work. Spotify even has running playlists organized by BPM. If nothing else, a good playlist will keep you motivated on such a monotonous machine.\n\nRunning hard intervals when you're already tired is tough. Flip the script with descending intervals: Start with your longest, hardest effort when you're fresh, then gradually decrease the interval length.\n\nFor example: Five minutes hard, two minutes easy, then four minutes hard, two minutes easy, working down to one minute hard. Psychologically, this can feel much more manageable because each interval is easier than the last. You're essentially creating momentum that carries you through the workout, rather than dreading increasingly difficult efforts.\n\nCombat treadmill boredom by mentally running a familiar outdoor route. Close your eyes briefly (only if you're comfortable and safe doing so) and visualize running through your neighborhood, a favorite trail, or even a dream destination.\n\nTake this further by matching your treadmill workout to the actual route profile. If there's a hill three miles into your usual run, increase the incline at the corresponding time on your treadmill. You could even use Google Maps street view before your workout to refresh your memory. For me, this mental trick makes time pass faster and maintains the connection between indoor and outdoor running.\n\nRunning negative splits on the treadmill—where your second half is faster than your first—is a classic race-oriented goal. Start your run at a comfortable pace, then increase speed by 0.1-0.2 mph every 5-10 minutes.\n\nThis approach works because it forces you to start conservatively, preventing the common mistake of burning out early. It also means you finish strong, and hey, that could help create a positive psychological association with treadmill running. More importantly, if you do have a race on the horizon, this type of workout trains your body to maintain energy for when it matters most.\n\nMost people either ignore the safety clip entirely or fumble with it ineffectively. Practice your emergency stop before you need it. While walking slowly, pull the clip intentionally to see how the treadmill responds. Knowing exactly what happens when you pull it means you won't panic if you stumble. Hopefully you won't need to use it, but this little practice could prevent a serious injury.\n\nHere's my recovery hack of the day: After your run, leave the treadmill at a 10-15% incline, turn it off, and use it for calf and Achilles stretches. Stand on the belt with your toes elevated and heels dropped down. The incline creates the perfect angle for a deep, effective stretch.\n\nHold for 30 seconds on each leg. This takes advantage of equipment you already have and addresses the tight calves that plague many treadmill runners. It's convenient, effective, and helps prevent the dreaded treadmill-induced stiffness.\n\nThe treadmill doesn't have to be a \"necessary evil.\" With these hacks, you can make indoor running safer, more effective, and genuinely more enjoyable. And who knows? Maybe one day I'll finally appreciate the unique benefits the treadmill offers: consistent pacing, controlled conditions, and the ability to execute very specific workouts regardless of weather.",

While you can run Clawdbot on Mac, Linux, and Windows, many online are opting to install the bot on dedicated Mac mini setups, leading to one part of the assistant's virality.\n\nBut there are other AI assistants that can be run locally—one thing that makes Clawdbot unique is that you communicate with it through chat apps. Which app you use is up to you, as Clawdbot works with apps like Discord, Google Chat, iMessages, Microsoft Teams, Signal, Telegram, WebChat, and WhatsApp. The idea is that you \"text\" Clawdbot as you would a friend or family member, but it acts as you'd expect an AI assistant to—except, maybe more so.\n\nThat's because, while Clawdbot can certainly do the things an AI bot like ChatGPT can, it's meant more for agentic tasks. In other words, Clawdbot can do things for you, all while running in the background on your devices. The bot's official website advertises that it can clear your inbox, send emails, manage your calendar, and check you in for flights—though power users are pushing the tool to do much more.\n\nClawdbot works with a host of apps and services you might use yourself. That includes productivity apps like Apple Notes, Apple Reminders, Things 3, Notion, Obsidian, Bear Notes, Trello, GitHub; music apps like Spotify, Sonos, and Shazam; smart home apps like Philips Hue, 8Sleep, and Home Assistant; as well as other major apps like Chrome, 1Password, and Gmail. It can generate images, search the web for GIFs, see your screen, take photos and videos, and check the weather. Based on the website alone, it has a lengthy résumé.\n\nThe last big point here is that Clawdbot has an advertised \"infinite\" memory. That means the bot \"remembers\" every interaction you've ever had with it, as well as all the actions it's taken on your behalf. In theory, you could use Clawdbot to build apps, run your home, or manage your messages, all within the context of everything you've done before. In that, it'd really be the closest thing to a \"digital assistant\" we've seen on this scale. These assistants have been mostly actionable—you ask the bot what you want to know or what you want done, and it (hopefully) acts accordingly. But the ideal version of Clawdbot would do all those things for you without you needing to ask.\n\nNot everyone is psyched about Clawdbot, though. Take this user, who jokes that, after four messages, the bot made a reservation, then, after six messages, was able to send a calendar invite, only to cost $87 in Opus 4.7 tokens. This user came up with a story (at least I hope it's a story) where they give Clawdbot access to their stock portfolio and tasked it with making $1 million without making mistakes. After thousands of reports, dozens of strategies, and many scans of X posts, it lost everything. \"But boy was it beautiful.\"\n\nI particularly like this take, which reads: \"[I've] made a tragic discovery using [Clawdbot.] [There] simply aren’t that many tasks in my personal life that are worth automating.\" There are also some jabs from what appear to be anti-AI users, like this one, that imagines a Clawdbot user with no job living in their parent's basement, asking the bot to do their tasks for the day.\n\nAs with all things AI, there are many thoughts, opinions, and criticisms here, especially considering how viral this new tool is. But the main critique seems to be that Clawdbot requires a lot (in terms of hardware, power, and privacy) without really offering much in return. Sure, it can do things for you, but do you really need a bot booking your plane tickets, or combing through your emails? The answer to that, I suppose, is up to each of us, but the \"backlash,\" if you can call it that, is likely coming from people who would answer \"no.\"\n\nIf you want to try Clawdbot, you'll likely need to have some technical experience first. You can get started from Clawdbot's official github page, as well as Clawdbot's \"Getting started\" guide. According to this page, you'll begin by running the Clawdbot onboarding wizard, which will set you up with the gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. This works on Mac, Linux, and Windows, and while you won't need a Mac mini, it seems to be what the Clawdbot crowd is running with.\n\nFull disclosure: Clawdbot and its setup go beyond my expertise, and I will not be installing it on my devices. However, if you have the knowledge to follow these instructions, or the will to learn, the developer has the steps listed in the links above.\n\nWhile I likely wouldn't install Clawdbot on my device anyway, the privacy and security implications here definitely keep me away.\n\nThe main issue with Clawdbot is that it has full control and access over whichever device you run it on, as well as any of the software that is running therein. That makes sense, on the surface: How is an agentic AI supposed to do things on your behalf if it does have access to the apps and hardware necessary for execution?\n\nBut the inherent security risk with any program like this involves prompt injection. Bad actors could sneak their own AI prompts into otherwise innocent sites and programs. When your bot crawls the text as it completes your task, it intercepts the prompt, and, thinking it's from you, executes that prompt instead. It's the main security flaw with AI browsers, and it could affect something like Clawdbot, too. And since you've given Clawdbot control over your entire computer and everything in it...yikes. Bad actors could manipulate Clawdbot to theoretically send DMs to anyone they like, run malicious programs, read and write files on your computer, trick Clawdbot into accessing your private data, and learn about your hardware for further cyber attacks.\n\nIn Clawdbot's case, these prompt injections could come from a number of sources. They could come from messages via bad actors through the chat apps you communicate through Clawdbot, they could come from the browsers you use to access the internet, and they could come from plugins you run on various programs, to name a few possibilities.\n\nClawdbot does have a security guide on its site that walks you through ways to shore up your defenses while using Clawdbot. The developer admits that running an AI agent with shell access on your machine is \"spicy,\" that this is both a product and an experiment, and that there is no \"perfectly secure\" setup. That said, there are security features built in here that serve a purpose and attempt to limit who can access Clawdbot, where Clawdbot can go, and what Clawdbot can do. That could involve locking down DMs, viewing links and attachments as \"hostile\" by default, reducing high-risk tools, and running modern AI models that have better protections against prompt injection.\n\nStill, the whole affair is too risky for me, especially considering I'm not sure I really want an AI assistant in the first place. I think companies believe we want to offload tasks like calendars, messages, and creation to bots, to save us time from menial to-do lists. Maybe some do, but I don't. I want to know who is reaching out to me and why, and not trust an AI to decide what messages are worth my attention. I want to write my own emails and know what events I have on my own calendar. I also want access to my own computer. Maybe some people trust AI enough to handle all these things for them—if it makes me a luddite to feel the opposite, so be it.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates, which have leveled out from recent lows. With the 30-year rate at 6%, it could be a good time to buy a house. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have stepped slightly higher from recent lows. The average 30-year fixed rate, according to data compiled from the lender marketplace of Zillow, is now 6.00%. The 15-year fixed rate currently sits at 5.50%. It could be a great time to buy a house or refinance your existing mortgage.\n\nMORE: 6% or less: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.00%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.00% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,799, and you’d pay $347,515 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.50% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.50% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,451. But you’d only pay $141,225 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate will go up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.00%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.50%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.15%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.00%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow gets rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score. Learn how to lower your refi costs, both at closing and long term.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nWhen you can refinance a mortgage depends on your loan type. You may have to wait up to 12 months.

    "description": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his caucus want the DHS funding bill stripped from the broader package, teeing up a partial government shutdown in the process.",
    "fullText": "Senate Republicans are moving ahead with a behemoth funding package in their bid to keep the government open and hope to blast through Democratic opposition in the process.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, on Monday teed up the first procedural step for the six-bill funding package, which includes the politically divisive Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spending bill, despite warnings from Senate Democrats that they would block the legislation.\n\nMonday’s action is just the first of several hurdles lawmakers will have to overcome, but important nonetheless given the extreme weather that rocked much of the country and threatened to delay the process altogether.\n\nSenate Democrats Threaten Shutdown By Blocking Dhs Funding After Minnesota Ice Shooting\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune’s, R-S.D., gamble comes as a Friday deadline to fund the government is bearing down on the Senate. Passing the package and sending it to President Donald Trump’s desk would fully fund the government until September, when lawmakers will again need to have passed a dozen spending bills to keep the lights on.\n\nBut the immediate fight and one that threatens to derail the GOP’s plan to avert yet another shutdown is over DHS funding.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his caucus have come out en masse against the broader package, including the Homeland funding bill, following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nSchumer and Senate Democrats rapidly mobilized their opposition to the funding bill, despite maintaining a fragile truce with the GOP in their bipartisan government funding negotiations over the last two days.\n\nKey Senator Won't Fund Dhs As Ice, Federal Agents Enter His State\n\nDespite shoring up a largely unified front, including several moderate Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle to help Republicans reopen the government last year, Schumer does have one perennial defector.\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has consistently opposed any attempt to shut down the government. He notably joined Senate Republicans over a dozen times last year to reopen the government as his colleagues resisted.\n\nAnd like those times before, Fetterman is not keen on shutting the federal government down, despite agreeing with Senate Democrats that the DHS bill should be stripped from the broader package.\n\nHe noted in a statement that even shutting down the government would affect Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding, given that the GOP’s colossal, \"one big, beautiful\" bill injected over $170 billion over the next several years into DHS.\n\nSenate Dems Revolt Against Dhs Funding Bill Amid Minneapolis Chaos, Hiking Government Shutdown Risk\n\n\"I reject the calls to defund or abolish ICE. I strongly disagree with many strategies and practices ICE deployed in Minneapolis, and believe that must change,\" Fetterman said. \"I want a conversation on the DHS appropriations bill and support stripping it from the minibus.\"\n\n\"It is unlikely that will happen, and our country will suffer another shutdown,\" he continued. \"We must find a way forward, and I remain committed to being a voice of reason and common sense.\"\n\nFetterman and his colleagues want the DHS bill stripped from the broader package and say that they would support those remaining five bills. But doing that would open up a procedural nightmare in the process and likely lead to a partial government shutdown, given that the House would have to return from a week-long break to weigh in.\n\nAnd like the last foray into a possible shutdown, Schumer argued that the onus was on Thune and Senate Republicans, despite Senate Democrats having negotiated the current funding package on a bipartisan basis.\n\n\"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\"\n\nOriginal article",

Kernodle was stabbed 67 times.\n\nThis is according to a newly unsealed supplemental filing from prosecutors in the case regarding expert testimony that was obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nThe report does not contain the full autopsy reports for the four victims, only key findings.\n\nGoncalves and Mogen were found together in Mogen's bedroom.\n\nThe autopsy report determined that both young women died from multiple sharp force injuries, with additional contributors to Goncalves' death including blunt force injuries of the head and asphyxial injuries.\n\nShe had at least 24 stab and incised wounds of the scalp, face and neck; 11 stab and incised wounds of the chest; and three stab and incised wounds of the upper extremities.\n\nThere were also punctures on the outer table of the skull, injuries to the teeth and tongue, and a hemorrhage into the chest cavities, according to the filing.\n\nThe blunt force injuries suffered by Goncalves include scalp lacerations, bleeding around the brain, nasal fracture, bruising around the eyes, and patterned bruising extended across the lower face.\n\nMogen suffered 13 stab incisions to the scalp face and neck; five stab wounds of the chest; and 10 incised wounds of the upper extremities, per the court filing.\n\nThe report states there were also wounds to the lung and liver, perforations of the subclavian vein, artery, and blood vessels of the chest wall, and an incision of the nasal septum.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nChapin and Kernodle were found in Kernodle's room, with Ethan in the bed and Kernodle on the floor.\n\nThe cause of death for the couple was also multiple sharp force injuries.\n\nChapin had one stab wound of the upper chest; four stab and incised wounds of the scalp face and neck; six incised wounds of the upper extremities; and six stab and incised wounds of the lower extremities.\n\nHe also had perforations of the jugular vein, subclavian vein, and subclavian artery.\n\nThose three victims were attacked as they slept and never stood up or had the chance to fight back, but Kernodle fought back.\n\nShe had abrasions and contusions of the head, torso and extremities along with: 23 stab and incised wounds of the scalp face and neck; seven stab wounds of the chest; four stab wounds of the abdomen; three incised and puncture wounds of the back; 25 incised wounds of the upper extremities; and five incised wounds of the lower extremities.\n\nThere were also punctures on the outer table of the skull; perforation of  the jugular vein, heart, lung, and pulmonary blood vessels; hemorrhage into the chest cavities; wounds extending into the bones of the right hand; and scrapes and bruises on the face, torso and extremities.\n\nKernodle also had blood on the bottom of her feet from moving around during her attack.\n\nIt was while examining the bodies that investigators found the evidence that broke the case open — the KA-ar knife sheath Kohberger left behind likely because Kernodle caught him in her roommate's room.\n\nThat sheath would provide the trace DNA used to link Kohberger to the crime scene.\n\nAfter murdering his four victims, Kohberger exited the home but he did not go unnoticed.\n\nThe killer locked eyes with one of the surviving roommates and the lone eyewitness in the case, Dylan Mortensen.\n\nThat eyewitness and his forgotten sheath are likely why Kohberger entered a guilty plea to four charges of first-degree murder back in July as part of a last-minute deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty.\n\nKohberger stood in front of the court and told the judge he was entering a guilty plea before confessing to the murder of each of the four victims.\n\nKohberger is now serving four life sentences for those murders.",

    "description": "The Maia 200 AI chip is described as an inference powerhouse — meaning it could lead AI models to apply their knowledge to real-world situations much faster and more efficiently.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "description": "\"Your body can’t metabolize it properly.\"",
    "fullText": "Soda is never the beverage of choice when it comes to health, but some types are better than others. If you want to drink Coca-Cola, for example, there are several varieties to choose from, with noticeable differences between them.\n\nContent creator David Céspedes (@dr.davidcespedes) recently shared a video revealing which variety of this iconic soda is the best of the worst, as AS reported.\n\n\"If you're going to drink supermarket Coca-Cola, I'll explain which one you should never touch and which is the least harmful,\" the doctor says in his video.\n\nDiet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar are the worst, Céspedes reveals.\n\n\"The main problem is aspartame,\" he says, referring to the artificial sweetener used in place of sugar in these diet products. \"Your body can't metabolize it properly, and it disrupts your brain, your gut microbiome, and your overall system.\"\n\nHowever, that doesn't make regular Coca-Cola healthy, as other experts have also highlighted.\n\n\"It's not safe either because it contains high-fructose corn syrup,\" says Céspedes. \"It's a ticking time bomb for your liver. One can has about 36 grams of sugar, enough to spike your blood sugar and increase inflammation.\"\n\nEven the container that the Coke comes in makes a difference. Céspedes points out that the plastic bottles shed microplastics into the soda you drink — the same effect that makes drinking bottled water unhealthy.\n\nCéspedes' position that drinking cola is never good for you has been backed up by experts, as Verywell Health reported. It leads to issues as small as acne breakouts and as large as heart disease.\n\nAll of that is on top of the negative impact of plastic bottles on the planet.\n\nDo you think forever chemicals should be banned from all products?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIf you can minimize your impact by switching to a similar, healthier product, that's better for you and for the entire world.\n\nUltimately, Céspedes recommends one specific product.\n\n\"If you're going to drink Coke, at least choose glass bottles,\" he says. \"They don't have the plastic lining of cans and usually use cane sugar, which your body handles much better than high-fructose corn syrup. … If you're going to indulge, do it with a glass bottle, in moderation, and knowing exactly what's inside.\"\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Quite an advantage in today’s world.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when reading this story:\n\nChondrichthyan fishes—a group that includes rays, skates, chimaeras, and sharks—are thought to have energy intensive reproduction cycles due in no small part to long gestation times and small litters.\n\nHowever, a new study analyzing the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) of Australia and New Guinea finds that this species shows no noticeable spike in metabolic rate during reproduction.\n\nThis is good news for both the epaulette shark and the coral reef system, which relies on the species to keep the underwater habitat healthy.\n\nThe epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), which lives off the coast of northern Australia and New Guinea, is a strange creature. For one, it’s the youngest known shark in the world, with genetic evidence suggesting their emergence only nine million years ago. But its true claim to fame is found within its common moniker—this three-foot-long “walking shark” can not only use its thick, muscular fins to explore its coral ecosystem, but it can also traverse above water between coral heads at low tide. Some experts argue that this may suggest that sharks could one day evolve to walk on land.\n\nBut a new study, published in the journal Biology Open, makes an even more puzzling discovery about this fascinating shallow-sea creature. Energy is king in the natural world, and a large driver of evolution is developing strategies to reduce energy expenditure by any means necessary. One of the biggest drains of that energy—as any human mother will tell you—is the physical act of reproduction, but even this immensely energy-intensive task has been remarkably streamlined in the epaulette shark.\n\n“Reproduction is the ultimate investment … you are literally building new life from scratch,”Jodie Rummer, the senior author of the study from James Cook University (JCU), said in a press statement. “We expected that when sharks make this complex egg, their energy use would shoot up.”\n\nThe assumption is that the reproduction cycle of sharks—along with other chondrichthyan fishes such as rays, skates, and chimaeras—are energy-intensive due to small litter sizes and their long gestation periods. The frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus), for example, holds the record for the longest vertebrate gestation at 3.5 years. To get more data on the energy requirements for shark reproduction, Rummer and her team recorded metabolic and physiological changes in five epaulette sharks during oviparous (egg-laying) reproduction by tracking oxygen uptake and measuring reproductive hormones. The results were not what the scientists expected.\n\n“There was no uptick in energy use, it was completely flat,” Rummer said in a press statement. “These sharks appear to have adapted their physiology to be able to optimize their energy use. This work challenges the narrative that when things go wrong—such as warming oceans—that reproduction will be the first thing to go.”\n\nThis good news expands beyond just epaulette sharks themselves. When animals are under stress, reproduction is often impacted as a means to conserve energy—and there’s no greater stressor than climate change. Luckily, the amazing “walking shark” doesn’t require an immense energy spike for reproduction, suggesting that the shark could continue exploring Australia’s coral reefs even as its waters warm.\n\n“Under environmental stress, many species will choose between survival and reproduction, but the epaulette shark might be able to continue to produce eggs, even under such stressors,” Carolyn Wheeler, the lead author and a recent JCU Ph.D. graduate, said in a press statement. “That’s encouraging, because healthy sharks equal healthy reefs.”\n\nWith any luck, future descendants of the epaulette shark will survive long enough to walk on an Earth where the dangerous effects of anthropogenic climate change are far in the rearview.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): Wonderful performance. It says 2-0 on the scoresheet, but if you watched the game it felt like Newcastle had the better chances. An xG of 2.18 for Newcastle and they didn't score so that comes down to him.\n\nIan Maatsen (Aston Villa): He hasn't actually been a regular. He does so much going forward for Villa with his crossing. He's not really known for his defending but I thought he shackled Harvey Barnes and put him in his back pocket.\n\nOla Aina (Nottingham Forest): The Brentford team he faced are well known for getting crosses in from the wide areas. I thought he defended excellently at the far post in Forest's 2-0 win, cleared everything. He was good at dealing with how people tried to run at him. He offered a lot going forward, too.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City): I know it's Wolves, so he gets a little less credit, but to instantly come in and get a clean sheet, you just saw the togetherness he brings. A lot of pressure on him going into a game where they have to win. He comes in and City get their first clean sheet in the Premier League since 1 January.\n\nJorge Cuenca (Fulham): A lot of people talk about Joachim Andersen and his range of passing. Cuenca is just steady and goes about his business, but he's always in control, never out of position - and again against Brighton. Very talented player.\n\nYouri Tielemans (Aston Villa): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile. He's slowly become Villa's most important player. He dictates the play, breaks it up, and does everything right. Very, very good player and that pains me to say as a Birmingham City fan.\n\nIbrahim Sangare (Nottingham Forest): Lost him during Afcon and it wasn't the same midfield. He is a pitbull next to Elliot Anderson; he does all of the ugly stuff and breaks it up. A fantastic footballer and part of a solid defensive unit, which obviously Forest needed.\n\nEmiliano Buendia (Aston Villa): Scored unbelievable goals, all vital for their team's attacking outlet. Buendia, for me, just showed that little bit of class and magic. I love to see players taking a risk.\n\nPatrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He's been unbelievable since Michael Carrick came in. That goal in the win at Arsenal was unbelievable and worthy of winning any football match in the world.\n\nEstevao Willian (Chelsea): Young, exciting player and got a goal and assist, but it was against Crystal Palace, so he doesn't get as much chat as the others.\n\nIgor Jesus (Nottingham Forest): In a weekend of strikers not being great, he was solid and Forest had two that ended up scoring. He battles and does all the ugly stuff well, and then he has that little bit of flair for his goal.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo (West Ham): A 3-1 win over Sunderland is huge - it gives West Ham a chance to stay up. If you look at the wins for Forest and now the draw for Leeds, West Ham would have been completely cut adrift. They've now given themselves a chance to get out of it. He gets that because of the biggest win of the weekend.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

That represents an addition of roughly 23 million shares, nearly doubling ​Nvidia's stake in the firm, according to Reuters calculations based on data ‌compiled by LSEG.\n\nNvidia was CoreWeave's third largest shareholder with a 6.3% stake, or 24.3 million shares, in the company.\n\nThe chip giant has drawn scrutiny for pouring billions of dollars into AI firms including ChatGPT maker OpenAI and neoclouds, raising investor concerns about potential circular financing.\n\nA CoreWeave spokesperson told Reuters that the ⁠cash from the new investment will not ​be used to purchase Nvidia processors, but directed ​toward accelerating other data center investments, research and development, and scaling its workforce.\n\nOnce a cryptocurrency miner, CoreWeave has pivoted to capitalize ‍on the AI ⁠boom by repurposing its infrastructure to lease Nvidia GPUs to tech and AI firms.\n\n\"Nvidia is the leading and most requested computing platform at every ⁠phase of AI ... This expanded collaboration underscores the strength of demand we are seeing across ‌our customer base,\" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two Iranian-backed militias in the Mideast are signaling their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran, as officials acknowledged the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier to the region Monday. President Donald Trump ordered the carriers to move to the Middle East as he threatened military action over its crackdown on nationwide protests.\n\nYemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on Monday hinted they were ready to resume attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. That came just after Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group, long supported by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, issued a direct threat late Sunday toward any attack targeting Iran, warning a “total war” in the region would be a result.\n\nThe statements came as the entire region is mired in a tense waiting game to see if Trump will strike. Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel's 12-day war on Iran in June that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The hesitancy to get involved shows the disarray still affecting Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” after facing attacks from Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe threats came as the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other guided missile destroyers in its strike group arrived in the region to “promote regional security and stability,” U.S. Central Command said Monday on social media.\n\nTrump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action against Iran. He has already laid out two red lines for attack — the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran conducting mass executions of those it has arrested in a massive crackdown over the demonstrations.\n\nA senior Iranian military official who spoke anonymously on Iran's State TV dismissed the American threat as “an exaggeration” and noted that Iran had increased its military presence in response. The official added that the Lincoln's presence was not a deterrent but an accessible target.\n\nThreats from Iraq, Yemen, while Hezbollah stays mum\n\nIran projected its power across the Mideast through the “Axis of Resistance,” a network of proxy militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, and other places. It was also seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. But it has collapsed after Israel targeted Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others during the Gaza war. Meanwhile, rebels in 2024 overthrew Syria’s Bashar Assad after a yearslong, bloody war in which Iran backed his rule.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of Iran's staunchest allies, refused to say how it planned to react in the case of a possible attack.\n\n“During the past two months, several parties have asked me a clear and frank question: If Israel and America go to war against Iran, will Hezbollah intervene or not?” Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said via a video address to thousands of supporters gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs for a rally backing Iran.\n\nHe said the group is preparing for “possible aggression and is determined to defend” against it. But as to how it would act, he said, “these details will be determined by the battle and we will determine them according to the interests that are present.”\n\nIraqi and Yemenite militant groups were much more forthright in their threats, which were interpreted as support for Iran. A short video by the Houthis included images of a ship on fire, with the caption: “Soon.” It later aired footage Monday from its January 2024 attack in the Gulf of Aden on the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Marlin Luanda, one of over 100 ships attacked as part of a campaign the Houthis said pressured Israel over its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Houthis halted their fire after a ceasefire in Gaza, though they've repeatedly warned they could resume fire if needed.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmad “Abu Hussein” al-Hamidawi of Kataib Hezbollah issued his own threat in a statement.\n\n“We affirm to the enemies that the war on the (Islamic) Republic will not be a picnic; rather, you will taste the bitterest forms of death, and nothing will remain of you in our region,” he said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates announced on Monday that it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for military action against Iran. The UAE said it would stress dialogue and diplomatic resolutions.\n\nIran warns America not to attack\n\nIranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaei-Nik renewed warnings Monday to both Israel and the U.S., saying any attack would “be met with a response that is more painful and more decisive than in the past.” Iranian state television quoted Talaei-Nik as saying that threats required Iran “to maintain full and comprehensive preparedness.”\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei separately told journalists: “Regional countries fully know that any security breach in the region will not affect Iran only. The lack of security is contagious.”\n\nIran over the weekend unveiled a new banner in Tehran's Enghelab Square threatening the Lincoln, showing an aircraft carrier strewn with bodies and streaked with blood with the warning: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.” However, Iran is still reeling from the 12-day war in June in which its air defense systems were broadly destroyed, top military leaders killed, and its nuclear enrichment sites bombed by the U.S.\n\nAs a sign of concern over its airspace, Iran issued a notice to pilots Sunday that banned small private aircraft from flying in the country, with carve-outs for the oil industry and emergency medical flights.\n\nMany Western airlines have started to avoid Iranian airspace entirely due to the tensions, though Gulf Arab carriers flying to Moscow still rely on the route. Iranian air defense troops in 2020 shot down a Ukrainian commercial airliner, killing 176 people on board.\n\nDeath toll rises from protest crackdown\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in its history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Monday put the death toll at 5,973, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,813 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "fullText": "Jan 26 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Meta Platforms and other social media companies asked a California federal judge on Monday to block several school districts from taking their lawsuits against the companies to trial, arguing that federal law protects them from claims they ​knowingly addicted young users.\n\nAt a hearing before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California, lawyers for the companies clashed with counsel ‌for six school districts from states across the country, who argue the platforms' design has harmed students' mental health and forced districts to spend money and staff time to address the fallout.\n\nThe companies urged ‌the judge to rule that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally shields platforms like Meta's Facebook and Instagram from liability over user-generated content, bars the cases from proceeding to the first trials in federal court over the claims.\n\nJonathan Blavin, an attorney for the social media companies, said the schools’ allegations rely on evidence that includes such content, placing the claims within the protections of Section 230.\n\n\"If that evidence is entirely excluded, I think the record here is incredibly thin,\" Blavin said. \"It's just ⁠not there.\"\n\nLawyers for the school districts countered that their ‌claims are not based on user-content but on platform features they say are intentionally designed to keep young people on the social media sites as long as possible.\n\nAndre Mura, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said their experts had examined broad studies of ‍students who had used social media to support their findings that it had harmed them.\n\n“The literature shows the increase in the risk of harm is not based on content,” he said.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS IN STATE, FEDERAL COURT\n\nMeta, Snapchat and parent Snap Inc., YouTube and parent Alphabet Inc., and TikTok and parent ByteDance are facing thousands of lawsuits in both federal and ​state court over claims they knowingly designed their platforms to have features that addict children and teens, fueling a mental health crisis.\n\nThe first trial testing ‌the claims in state court is slated for this week in Los Angeles.\n\nThe federal cases have been consolidated into multidistrict litigation before Rogers and include lawsuits brought by families, school districts and state governments.\n\nMonday's hearing focused only on cases filed by school districts, which claim they have been hurt financially from having to manage student mental health issues and social problems like cyberbullying. Rogers is considering whether to enter judgment for the companies in six of those lawsuits, selected as so-called \"bellwether\" or test cases, ahead of the first trials in federal court, currently scheduled to begin in June.\n\nBellwether trials are used to gauge how juries may respond to similar ⁠claims and help establish settlement values for the other similar cases in the litigation.\n\nIn rulings ​on the companies’ motions to dismiss in 2023 and 2024, Rogers said the cases could go ​forward, but Section 230 limited many of their claims, including some about specific features of the platforms.\n\nOn Monday, Rogers agreed that the plaintiffs had a lot of evidence that seemed to be based on content and said that should the cases go forward, there ‍would be a lengthy debate about what ⁠could be shown to the juries.\n\nBut even if the actual content played some role, Rogers said that juries were often asked to examine a problem with several causes and determine which were primarily to blame.\n\n“It’s not like we have a white and a yolk, it’s all scrambled together,” Rogers ⁠said. “That’s a very common circumstance. Why should this be any different?”\n\nThe case is In Re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District ‌of California, No. 4:22-md-03047.\n\nFor plaintiffs: Andre Mura of Gibbs Mura; Previn Warren of Motley Rice\n\nFor defendants: Jonathan Blavin of Munger Tolles & Olson; ‌Ashley Hardin of Williams & Connolly; Christian Pistilli of Covington & Burling",
