Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres have to decide what to do with Alex Tuch.\n\nThe reality is that the decision may make itself.\n\nThe Sabres entered the Olympic break on fire. They've got a great chance to end their 14-year playoff drought.\n\nTuch is in the last year of his contract, but that may be irrelevant at this point. Can the Sabres really trade away a veteran as if they're a seller? They should be buying.\n\nDavid Pagnotta reported Saturday that the Sabres \"owe it to the fans\" and should keep Tuch, effectively serving as their own \"rental.\"\n\nMORE: Nathan MacKinnon went viral for his Olympic focus that paid off\n\nThat certainly seems like the path that would keep Buffalo fans the happiest and keep the locker room the most connected.\n\nTuch is 29 years old, originally from Syracuse, N.Y.\n\nThis is his fifth season with the Sabres. Through 56 games, he has 22 goals and 26 assists (48 points).\n\nTuch had 67 points last season, 59 the year before and 79 the season before that.\n\nClearly, he's a reliable contributor since coming to Buffalo from Vegas.\n\nThe Sabres can't afford to give up Tuch and get worse this season. They've got a bright future regardless. The asset they get in a Tuch deal would be hard to be worth the loss they'd take right now.\n\nIt could still go either way, but Pagnotta's report indicates the Sabres are certainly at least thinking about the implications of it all and might end up keeping Tuch.\n\nMORE: Megan Keller's childhood dreams culminate in a dream come true",

    "description": "The Cleveland Browns will likely never see Jeramiah Owusu-Koramoah play ever again, coupled with the likelihood of Devin Bush leaving in free agency, and the Cleveland Browns may need to draft someone to help soothe the fire that's burning in Berea at the linebacker position.",
    "fullText": "3 Rookie linebackers that could soothe the Cleveland Browns after disappointing news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSad news out of Berea, Ohio, as former Pro Bowl linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah is likely to never play again. The linebacker, who fans call 'JOK', has been out since mid-way in 2024, following a neck injury. The injury was significant, and Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com is reporting that the linebacker will likely never play again because of it. The loss of the versatile linebacker will hurt the Browns' defense long-term, as many had hoped he could come back in time. As one of the few, true, three-down linebackers, his impact on the Browns was undeniable.\n\nNow the Browns have a tough task ahead of them, with having to replace a rare three-down linebacker. The Browns did make moves with the idea they'd have to replace Owusu-Koramoah long-term. They went ahead and drafted Carson Schwesinger to help replace the lost production, which paid off. Schwesinger won the 2025AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Award due to his own versatility, helping the Browns' defense be one of the best in the NFL.\n\nHis addition was enough to keep the Browns from panic mode, but the hits to the defense keep coming. Now there is concern that Devin Bush, another high-level linebacker for the Browns, may be on his way out of Cleveland in search of a bigger contract. The Browns can't afford to lose Owusu-Koramoah and Bush in the same offseason and still expect the Browns defense to continue its elite ways. They'll need to add some talent. With the cap room for the team always a concern, turning to the draft for an affordable option makes the most sense.\n\nThese three players seem like perfect fits for what the Browns are hoping to accomplish next season, while also keeping in mind the other needs the team has to address.\n\nMore: Is JOK’s career over? Latest update on Browns LB Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah\n\n1. Jake Golday, Cincinnati University, Projected 2nd-3rd Round\n\nThe linebacker out of Cincinnati could be a huge addition to the Browns. As a prospect, he's 6'4, he'll likely be closer to 250 lbs by the time the season starts, and according to NFL Draft Buzz, runs a 4.55 40-yard dash. He's big, fast, and versatile, and would be the perfect fit alongside Schwesinger. It's likely you'd need to take him in the second or third round of the draft, which may not sit well with some. There's a belief that the Browns should consider the wide receiver and the offensive line as more pressing matters to address early. Yet, if you want a strong defense, you have to add the talent necessary to keep it going.\n\n2. Josiah Trotter, Missorui University, Projected late-2nd Round\n\nThere are a few players in the 2026 NFL Draft with the pedigree that this prospect has. The son of Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, Josiah Trotter, has proven himself to be a hot prospect. He's a little undersized, just like his dad was in his day, but he's considered one of the best prospects against the run at the linebacker position. Few draft hopefuls are expected to make as much of a positive impact against the run as Trotter. He does lack the pass-coverage skills needed to be a three-down linebacker, but next to Schwesinger, that flaw may not be such an issue.\n\n3. Lander Barton, University of Utah, Projected 6th-Round\n\nAt a massive 6'5, 240 lbs, Lander Barton could be a massive project for the Cleveland Browns to work with. He's had a solid run with the Utes, but a down senior year hurt his draft stock. PFF and NFL Draft Buzz both paint a picture of him being a jack of all trades, but a master of none. He excels at no specific thing, but he isn't bad at any one thing. He'll need some work, but his size and speed (rumored 4.55 40-time) could make him a digestible late-round pick. Some Browns fans want offensive help first, and if the team follows that path, Barton would be a nice project pick late in the process.\n\nFrom QB chaos to defensive studs: Re-grading the Browns wild 2025 NFL Draft class\n\nThe AJ Brown trap: Why Jeremy Fowler’s Browns trade proposal is a huge mistake\n\nBrowns 2026 win total revealed: Why you should hammer the over on Vegas odds\n\nDeshaun Watson 2.0?

    "fullText": "Jacob Bridgeman closed in on a first US PGA Tour title on Saturday, firing an impressive seven-under par 64 to take a six-stroke lead over world number two Rory McIlroy heading into the final round of the Genesis Invitational.\n\nBridgeman, who played the iconic Riviera Country Club course for the first time on Wednesday, made his way around like an old hand, matching the tournament's 54-hole record with a 19-under par total of 194.\n\nMcIlroy started the day one stroke behind co-leaders Bridgeman and Marco Penge but endured a tough day on Riviera's greens and finished with just three birdies and a bogey in his two-under 69 for 200.\n\nBridgeman, a 26-year-old American chasing his first PGA Tour title, was up by three after three birdies in his first four holes.\n\nHe picked up four strokes in the space of three holes to pull away for good. After rolling in a 12-foot birdie at the 10th he eagled the par-five 11th -- where he landed his 259-yard approach a foot from the pin. He drilled an 11-foot birdie putt at the 12th.\n\nMcIlroy, who completed his career Grand Slam at the Masters last year, admitted to some frustration as he found himself unable to put pressure on Bridgeman.\n\n\"The greens got really fast there at the end of the day,\" McIlroy said. \"You're grinding over three-footers and all of a sudden you get one that you think you can have a bit of a run at and if you hit it a little bit too hard ...\"\n\n\"I found the greens really, really difficult today,\" added McIlroy, whose difficulties were epitomized at the par-five 17th, where he was on the green in two but ultimately missed a four and a half-foot birdie putt.\n\nMcIlroy said he'd aim for a fast start on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm hitting the ball well. If I can keep driving it like that, putting the ball in the fairway, just giving myself chances and go from there -- that's all I can really do,\" said McIlroy, who was one stroke in front of South African Aldrich Potgieter.\n\nThe 21-year-old Potgieter, who claimed his lone PGA Tour title to date at the Rocket Classic in Detroit last year, had an eagle and six birdies in his six-under 65 and at 12-under was one clear of England's Aaron Rai, who shot a 66.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, who pushed his streak of PGA Tour cuts made to 68 without a stroke to spare after an erratic two days, climbed the leaderboard with a five-under 66 for five-under 208.\n\nScheffler, who said this week he has a \"weird\" relationship with Riviera, made four of his six birdies on the back nine, shaking off his lone bogey with the help of solid putting.\n\n\"At times it still felt weird,\" he said. \"The golf course is gettable in the morning, the greens are fresher. So I was able to hole a few putts, which is key.\"",

The main event is Sean Strickland vs. Anthony Hernandez in the Middleweight division, with Hernandez looking to ‘torture’ Strickland and pad his case for a title shot against Khamzat Chimaev. Strickland, who lost to Du Plessis in his last fight might jump to the front of the line if he has an impressive win over the streaking ‘Fluffly’.\n\nThe co-main event has Geoff Neal coming off a terrible loss to Carlos Prates. He’s meeting the KO machine Uros Medic (who has been sparked out once himself). That fight should produce a highlight reel moment or two.\n\nThe main card also has Dan ige vs. Melquizael Costa, Serghei Spivac vs. Ante Delija, Jacobe Smith vs. Josiah Harrell and Zachary Reese vs. Michel Pereira.\n\nThe UFC Houston “Prelims” are headlined by Chidi Njokuani vs. Carlos Leal. Other “Prelim” bouts of note include Ramiz Brahimaj vs. Punahele Soriano and Jordan Leavitt vs. Yadier del Valle.\n\nUFC Houston airs on Paramount+ tonight, which is our new normal.\n\nThe “Prelims” begin at 5 p.m. ET and the main card goes live at 8 p.m. ET.

He was able to get Osbourne down five times, making it very hard to give any round to Osbourne. This is the second fight in a row where his takedown defense has been exploited, resulting in a loss.\n\nOfficial decision: Idiris Alibi def.

He showed a lot of promise, again, by thoroughly dismantling Luis Gurule. He hurt Gurule with his striking, particularly his uppercuts and body kicks. And he was able to bounce and squirm out of bad positions, almost instantly, when Gurule threatened with wrestling. Easy to score that one.\n\nOfficial results: Alden Coria def.

In the second, though, Edwards got inside and landed a big slam on Cornolle (injuring her shoulder). Edwards followed up with hammerfists and then worked for the rear naked choke. Cornolle screamed in pain after the bout. She may have had her collarbone broken.\n\nTAP TAP TAP 💪\n\nJoselyne Edwards ends this rematch by getting the submission in round 2!\n\n[ #UFCHouston | LIVE NOW on @ParamountPlus ] pic.twitter.com/ig1udeOcIA\n\nOfficial decision: Joselyne Edwards def.

Brahimaj did great in the first round, troubling Soriano with his speed and bodywork. But in the second Soriano’s strength advantage allowed him to spend a lot of the fight with Brahimaj pressed in the cage. In the pivotal third round Soriano came out hot and threw four head kicks in a row, with some sneaking through Brahimaj’s guard. Those hurt Brahimaj and took the wind out of him. He faded a lot down the stretch, due to those. I had Soriano winning 29-28.\n\n4 straight! 💥@Puna185 walks out of H-Town with the UD win! \n\n[ #UFCHouston | LIVE on @ParamountPlus ] pic.twitter.com/1KjXoJm3Vs\n\nOfficial decision: Punahele Soriano def.

He got into a 0-2 hole against Lebosnoyani, who was aggressive on the feet and was able to get takedowns in the first round. In the third Rowe landed hard shots (single shots, though), but wasn’t able to summon up the barrage needed to score a late win. I had Lebosnoyani winning each round, but the third was close.\n\nTHROWING BOWS EARLY 🤩\n\n[ #UFCHouston | Jean-Paul Lebosnoyani | LIVE on @ParamountPlus ] pic.twitter.com/ZrVOU6cIit\n\nOfficial decision: Jean-Paul Lebosnoyani def.

Leavitt looked very big, and strong, at Featherweight and he proved that Del Valle is still a very raw prospect (he also literally spanked him in the third round). He won every round for me.\n\nOfficial decision: Jordan Leavitt def.

    "fullText": "Huntington Beach (Calif.) four-star quarterback Brady Edmunds is the first 2027 QB prospect to land an invitation to the Elite 11 Finals this summer.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 Ohio State commit was among the many signal-callers competing at Saturday’s Los Angeles Elite 11 Regional — just the second regional of the year. He impressed and will now return in a few months.\n\nThere are few higher honors for high school quarterbacks than being invited to the event, which will celebrate its 27th year in 2026. It bring together 20 of the country’s elite signal-callers for three days of competition and training in Los Angeles during the month of June.\n\nElite 11 alumni include Carson Palmer, Andrew Luck, Matthew Stafford, Tim Tebow, and more recently Trevor Lawrence, C.J. Stroud, Bryce Young and more. Last year’s Elite 11 Finals featured 16 of the top 25 quarterbacks in the Rivals Industry Rankings, including five of the top six players at the position.\n\nAs a junior for Huntington Beach, Edmunds threw for 2,724 yards and 32 touchdowns to just two interceptions across 11 games, per MaxPreps. He also rushed for four scores. Across his last three seasons, Edmunds has over 8,600 passing yards and 107 total touchdowns.\n\nThe Buckeyes have held Edmunds’ pledge since Dec. 2, 2024. Well over a year later, he remains locked in with the Big Ten program.\n\n“I’ve never felt better,” Edmunds previously told Rivals. “I am committed to the best team in the land.”\n\nEdmunds is the No. 115 overall prospect and No. 10 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 12 player in the Golden State.",

    "description": "Man City 2-1 Newcastle: Pep Guardiola’s men closed the gap on Premier League leaders Arsenal to just two points with victory at the Etihad",
    "fullText": "When Manchester City won at Anfield, Pep Guardiola declared that all his side could do was breathe down the neck of Arsenal. And if the Premier League leaders are feeling ever more uncomfortable, it is because they can sense their pursuers are ever closer.\n\nThe margin is two points now, giving Arsenal all the more reason to rue the two they dropped at Molineux, all the more pressure in Sunday’s North London derby. City are acquiring the momentum Arsenal seem to have mislaid.\n\nAnd, after Arsenal capitulated at Wolves, City had a player who grasped the opportunity. They have spent around £430m in the last three transfer windows but their catalyst cost nothing. Three midfielders Guardiola has signed in the last 14 months began on the bench, in Nico Gonzalez, Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki, while the homegrown Nico O’Reilly started and delivered his first Premier League brace. Strange as it sounds, he is level for goals in 2026 with Erling Haaland. This was the sort of display that, if City become champions, may be bracketed with some of Yaya Toure’s goalscoring displays in past glories.\n\nThe life of O’Reilly may yet involve a trip to the World Cup. The life of Guardiola can involve reinventing and reimagining footballers. O’Reilly, a No 10 in his younger days, became a talismanic makeshift left-back. Now he has been recast as a marauding midfielder. “He played full-back, holding midfielder, he can play now in his position,” reflected Guardiola. “What a player. He makes an incredible step. Nico give us in the middle that physicality that we need.”\n\nMeanwhile, Haaland and Omar Marmoush, the split strikers and supposed scorers, became O’Reilly’s suppliers, each registering an assist. The Mancunian’s double showed different sides to his game; for the first, he arrowed in a shot from 18 yards after powering forward to meet Marmoush’s pass; the Egyptian may have been selected as a specialist for such a fixture, given his record of scoring against Newcastle, but instead helped make a goal.\n\nO’Reilly’s second felt the kind Haaland should be scoring. Instead, the Norwegian lofted the cross to the far post and the local lad met it with a towering header. “The assist from Erling was unbelievable,” added Guardiola. Haaland will almost certainly end the season with his third Premier League Golden Boot but now only Bruno Fernandes has more assists in the current campaign.\n\nAntoine Semenyo and Marmoush might have got a third for City while Nick Pope made a 91st-minute double save from Haaland and Phil Foden. None struck, which meant Gianluigi Donnarumma’s terrific 94th-minute stop was needed to deny Harvey Barnes and secure the points.\n\nYet, amid the tension, there was a predictability to the outcome. City’s fifth straight win in all competitions was a third over Newcastle in 2026. There may be a fourth when they meet in the FA Cup in two weeks. As Newcastle’s last point at the Etihad came in 2006, an extraordinarily unsuccessful run was extended. Nevertheless, they threatened to end it.\n\nAt least a 17th straight reverse brought a first top-flight goal here since 2018 and in Eddie Howe’s reign. Lewis Hall squeezed a shot through a crowded box, aided by a deflection off Rodri. It was a landmark goal for the left-back, too; his first in 21 months.\n\nWhen Newcastle pulled level, City restored their lead inside five minutes. That was an immediate riposte and City’s swift start had suggested they were intent on making a point. They played at a blistering pace. Newcastle struggled in the first half and rallied thereafter. “You have to take into account the game in midweek and the travel,” said Howe, who fielded 10 of the side who started against Qarabag in Azerbaijan three days earlier. “It was a good effort by the lads physically.”\n\nHowe rued the defensive errors for the two goals. Newcastle might have scored two of their own. Dan Burn headed in Sandro Tonali’s free kick and had begun celebrating before he was flagged. It seemed he was pushed into an offside position by Ruben Dias, though Howe did not complain.\n\nNewcastle had another threat, even when under the cosh: Anthony Gordon’s pace on the break rendered him a menace. He drew a fine save from Donnarumma after motoring past Marc Guehi. When he was accelerating beyond Dias, the defender tugged him back, at a cost of a caution. He went off at half-time, the faster Abdukodir Khusanov replacing him. Gordon was less of a threat thereafter. Guardiola’s change worked.\n\nSo City left the field to cheers. They entered it to a guard of honour from their 1976 League Cup winners, who beat Newcastle in the final and secured the club’s last major trophy for 35 years. It felt as if it should have been the other way around, the current players forming the guard for their predecessors.\n\nThis new-look City side have not won much together. “Seventy per cent of the players have never been in that situation,” noted Guardiola. But perhaps they appear better equipped to cope with it than Arsenal.",

    "description": "While in New Delhi on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said \"there will come a time\" for orbital data centers, but it won't be anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman famously don't agree on much.\n\nThe latest point of contention: data centers in space. Musk has made it a priority. Altman thinks it's a fantasy, at least for now.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman said during a live interview with local media in New Delhi on Friday, causing audience members to laugh.\n\nAltman said that orbital data centers could \"make sense someday,\" but factors like launch costs and the difficulty of repairing a computer chip in space remain overwhelming obstacles.\n\n\"We are not there yet,\" Altman added. \"There will come a time. Space is great for a lot of things. Orbital data centers are not something that's going to matter at scale this decade.\"\n\nMusk would almost certainly disagree.\n\nWhile many Big Tech and AI companies are spending billions on data center construction on Earth, Musk's eyes are on the stars, per usual. Orbital data centers are his latest ambition, as he mentioned in an all-hands xAI meeting in December.\n\nIn February, SpaceX said its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers.\" The company has already begun hiring engineers to make that happen.\n\nDuring an all-hands meeting with xAI employees this month, Musk said SpaceX's acquisition of xAI will allow them to deploy the orbital data centers faster.\n\nDespite Altman's skepticism, other tech leaders are also racing to place data centers in space. Google's Project Suncatcher, unveiled in November 2025, aims to do just that. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Fox News Sunday the company could start placing data centers — powered by the sun — in space as early as 2027.\n\nTech and AI companies rely on data centers to power their products, like large language models and chatbots. Those data centers, however, can deplete water resources, strain power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the overall quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024, nearly four times the number from 2010.\n\nNow, proposed data center campuses in Texas, Oklahoma, and elsewhere are increasingly facing stiff resistance from local communities.",

    "description": "Residents cheered when a New Jersey city decided to remove data centers from its redevelopment plan. Data centers are now a flash point in many towns.",
    "fullText": "Like a modern-day Paul Revere, Ben Dziobek's voice rang across the night as he ran toward a crowd waiting outside New Brunswick City Hall on Wednesday.\n\nThe news? Members of the city council struck down potential plans to build a data center.\n\n\"They canceled it! They canceled it!\" Dziobek shouts in footage shared by New Jersey's Climate Revolution Action Network. Loud cheers followed, and then a chant: \"The people, united, will never be defeated!\"\n\nThe New Brunswick City Council had just decided to remove data centers from the list of permitted uses in a plan to redevelop several parcels of land. While no data center had yet been proposed, even the possibility that a data center could someday end up there raised alarm among city residents.\n\n\"The city administration is asking the council to amend the redevelopment plan to remove data centers as a permitted use, and to reinsert the requirement for inclusion of a park on the site that's provided in the prior redevelopment,\" New Brunswick's city planner Daniel Dominguez said at the meeting.\n\nLarge, warehouse-style data centers have become a flash point for many communities across America as Big Tech and other AI companies look to power the large language models and chatbots they say are going to change the world. Those data centers, however, can be a drain on water resources and power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024. These data centers, the report found, could consume as much power as entire US states and guzzle enormous amounts of water daily in drought-stricken regions.\n\nIn New Brunswick, those environmental concerns were top of mind.\n\n\"Community members cited concerns over environmental impact, energy consumption, water usage, noise pollution, and the broader implications of allowing large‐scale artificial intelligence and data infrastructure to expand into residential and public community spaces,\" the Climate Revolution Action Network, a local environmental activist group that helped organize opposition to the redevelopment plan, said in a press release.\n\nOn Wednesday, residents and environmental advocates attended a New Brunswick City Council meeting to discuss the proposal.\n\nDuring the meeting, Dominguez said the inclusion of a potential data center in the redevelopment plan was intended to \"diversify the commercial development site,\" but that it was \"not critical to the project.\"\n\nAttendees cheered after the city council ultimately voted to nix the data center.\n\n\"I'd like to thank the council for deciding to scrap what many people did not want in their neighborhoods,\" one attendee said. \"We don't want these kinds of centers in here that are going to take resources from the community.\"\n\nNew Brunswick is one among many communities across the country fighting potential data center developments.\n\nA large group of residents opposing a proposed data center in Clarmore, Oklahoma, turned out for a council meeting to discuss the project last week. Police arrested one of them for speaking for 30 seconds over their allotted three minutes. In San Marcos, Texas, hundreds of residents showed up at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a data center. The city council eventually scrapped that plan after a nearly 9-hour debate, according to local reports.",

    "fullText": "A gurn or chuck[citation needed] is a distorted facial expression and a verb to describe the action. A typical gurn involves projecting the lower jaw as far forward and up as possible and covering the upper lip with the lower lip.[1]\n\nThe English Dialect Dictionary, compiled by Joseph Wright, defines the word gurn as \"to snarl as a dog; to look savage; to distort the countenance,\" while the Oxford English Dictionary suggests the derivation may originally be Scottish, related to grin. In Northern Ireland, the verb to gurn means \"to cry\", and crying is often referred to as \"gurnin'\". Originally the Scottish dialectical usage refers to a person who is complaining. The term gurn may also refer to an involuntary facial muscular contortion experienced as a side-effect of MDMA consumption.[2]\n\nGurning contests are a rural English tradition. They are held regularly in some villages, with contestants traditionally framing their faces through a horse collar—known as \"gurnin' through a braffin\".[3]\n\nThe World Gurning Championship takes place annually at the Egremont Crab Fair.[4] The fair dates back to 1267, when King Henry III granted it a Royal Charter.[5] The origins of the gurning competition itself are unclear, and it may not be so old, although it was described as an ancient tradition by local newspaper The Cumberland Paquet in 1852.[6]\n\nThe most successful gurners are often those with no teeth. This provides greater room to move the jaw further up. In some cases, the elderly or otherwise toothless can perform gurns where their lower lip covers the nostrils. A notable example of this was performed by Jovante Carter, a 22-year-old American man from New Orleans. He held the gurn for 1 minute and 2 seconds, earning a Guinness World Record.[7][8]\n\nPeter Jackman became England's best-known gurner, winning the world championship four times, beginning in 1998 with a face called the \"Bela Lugosi\". He made numerous TV appearances, including an appearance on They Think It's All Over.[9] He had his teeth removed in 2000 to make his features easier to manoeuvre.[10]\n\nThe only male gurner to win the world title 15 times is Tommy Mattinson (UK), who took the top prize at the World Gurning Championship in 1986–87 and then 10 times between 1999 and 2010.[11]\n\nAnne Woods won the women's world title 28 times.[12]",

    "fullText": "Seven years after firing them into the Premier League, Tammy Abraham is back scoring goals at Aston Villa to keep their fans and manager dreaming of glory.\n\nWith Villa on the verge of losing 1-0 to Leeds United on Saturday, substitute Abraham, who had only been on the pitch for 13 minutes, guided the ball with his knee into the net to score an 88th-minute equaliser.\n\nIt was the 28-year-old's second goal since returning to the club following his £18.2m move from Besiktas in January, after scoring in the 3-1 loss to Newcastle in the FA Cup seven days ago.\n\nBut scoring for Villa is nothing new for the 11-time England international. He netted 25 times in 37 Championship games to help the club win promotion in 2018-19 during a loan spell from Chelsea.\n\nAfter his original time with Villa, Abraham had two seasons at Chelsea, three at Roma, one on loan at AC Milan and then another loan spell at Besiktas, with the Turkish club buying him to then immediately sell him to Villa for a profit.\n\n\"It feels like a dream to come back and play for this club again,\" said Abraham. \"I'm happy to be here and bring extra energy.\n\n\"I had to sniff around the box, be alert, be ready. Luckily for us, I got the goal - it was in front of some of the best supporters in the world.\"\n\nAbraham equaliser earns draw for Villa against Leeds\n\nDespite the late equaliser, third-placed Villa have now dropped seven points from their past four matches and sit seven points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 11 games to go.\n\nAsked whether the Villa squad feel like they are title contenders, Abraham said: \"Who knows what can happen? We are not too far from Arsenal who are at the top. Unfortunately today we didn't get the win but we just have to keep pushing.\n\n\"When I first arrived I spoke with a few of the boys, and watching from afar you can see that the team has a lot of qualities. We're delighted to be where we are today but we are so close, so we have to just keep pushing and keep believing in ourselves.\n\n\"I'm happy to be back home. I just need to find myself a house!\"\n\nEven though Arsenal have drawn back-to-back games, it is hard to see them or second-placed Manchester City dropping enough points for Villa to take advantage and become English champions for the first time since 1981.\n\nBoss Unai Emery has consistently talked down his side's chances of winning the league, last month saying even a top-five position could be beyond them.\n\nHe was quick to remind the supporters, some of whom booed the team off at half-time when they were trailing 1-0 on Saturday, that they were still enjoying a fantastic campaign.\n\n\"We are at a beautiful and fantastic moment to compete in two competitions for the remainder of the season,\" he said. \"It is the moment to show our wishes and follow our dreams.\n\n\"We have a great opportunity to achieve our objectives and dream of big things. Our position in the table is enviable and we all would have signed up for it before the season began.\n\n\"The Premier League is very difficult for us, but we are third - and that's very good. Our priority is to focus on every match. We're third with 51 points and the next step is Wolves [on Friday].\n\n\"We're setting our standards high and sometimes you can get frustrated, but overall our consistency is still there and we're third because of that consistency.\"\n\nAbraham, who received a great reception from the club's fans when he came on, played alongside Ollie Watkins, instead of replacing him.\n\nEmery said that was a tactic he would do again in the right circumstances, with Abraham also relishing the competition for a place.\n\n\"We spoke about it [playing together] a few times in training, and luckily we were able to grab the goal so the gaffer can see that it can work,\" added Abraham.\n\n\"We know he is a top striker and he has been here for a few years and scored many goals, so it is fantastic competition to have.\"\n\nEmery was full of praise for the new recruit and added: \"He left the Premier League seven years ago and now he is adapting in everything we're demanding.\n\n\"It's a huge commitment from him to try to help us with his qualities, and he showed it because he played 20 minutes and he was motivated, excited and scored from it.\"\n\nLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Aston Villa - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Despite having just 3 billion parameters, Ferret-UI Lite matches or surpasses the benchmark performance of models up to 24 times larger.",
    "fullText": "Despite having just 3 billion parameters, Ferret-UI Lite matches or surpasses the benchmark performance of models up to 24 times larger. Here are the details.\n\nIn December 2023, a team of 9 researchers published a study called “FERRET: Refer and Ground Anything Anywhere at Any Granularity”. In it, they presented a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that was capable of understanding natural language references to specific parts of an image:\n\nSince then, Apple has published a series of follow-up papers expanding the Ferret family of models, including Ferretv2, Ferret-UI, and Ferret-UI 2.\n\nSpecifically, Ferret-UI variants expanded on the original capabilities of FERRET, and were trained to overcome what the researchers defined as a shortcoming of general-domain MLLMs.\n\nFrom the original Ferret-UI paper:\n\nRecent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate “any resolution” on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features.\n\nA few days ago, Apple expanded the Ferret-UI family of models even further, with a study called Ferret-UI Lite: Lessons from Building Small On-Device GUI Agents.\n\nFerret-UI was built on a 13B-parameter model, which focused primarily on mobile UI understanding and fixed-resolution screenshots. Meanwhile, Ferret-UI 2 expanded the system to support multiple platforms and higher-resolution perception.\n\nAccording to the researchers of the new paper, “the majority of existing methods of GUI agents […] focus on large foundation models.” That is because “the strong reasoning and planning capabilities of large server-side models allow these agentic systems to achieve impressive capabilities in diverse GUI navigation tasks.”\n\nThey note that while there has been a lot of progress on both multi-agent, and end-to-end GUI systems, that take different approaches to streamline the many tasks that involve agentic interaction with GUIs (“low-level GUI grounding, screen understanding, multi-step planning, and self-reflection”), they are basically too large and compute-hungry to run well on-device.\n\nSo, they set out to develop Ferret-UI Lite, a 3-billion parameter variant of Ferret-UI, which “is built with several key components, guided by insights on training small-scale” language models.\n\nThe result is a model that closely matches or even outperforms competing GUI agent models that are up to 24 times its parameter count.\n\nWhile the entire architecture (which is thoroughly detailed in the study) is interesting, the real-time cropping and zooming-in techniques are particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe model makes an initial prediction, crops around it, then re-predicts on that cropped region. This helps such a small model compensate for its limited capacity to process large numbers of image tokens.\n\nAnother notable contribution of the paper is how Ferret-UI Lite basically generates its own training data. The researchers built a multi-agent system that interacts directly with live GUI platforms to produce synthetic training examples at scale.\n\nThere is a curriculum task generator that proposes goals of increasing difficulty, a planning agent breaks them into steps, a grounding agent executes them on-screen, and a critic model evaluates the results.\n\nWith this pipeline, the training system captures the fuzziness of real-world interaction (such as errors, unexpected states, and recovery strategies), which is something that would be much more challenging to do while relying on clean, human-annotated data.\n\nInterestingly, while Ferret-UI and Ferret-UI 2 used iPhone screenshots and other Apple interfaces in their evaluations, Ferret-UI Lite was trained and evaluated on Android, web, and desktop GUI environments, using benchmarks like AndroidWorld and OSWorld.\n\nThe researchers don’t note explicitly why they chose this route for Ferret-UI Lite, but it likely reflects where reproducible, large-scale GUI-agent testbeds are available today.\n\nBe it as it may, the researchers found that while Ferret-UI Lite performed well on short-horizon, low-level tasks, it did not perform as strongly on more complicated, multi-step interactions, a trade-off that would be largely expected, given the constraints of a small, on-device model.\n\nOn the other hand, Ferret-UI Lite offers a local, and by extension, private (since no data needs to go to the cloud and be processed on remote servers) agent that autonomously interacts with app interfaces based on user requests, which, by all accounts, is pretty cool.\n\nTo learn more about the study, including benchmark breakdowns and results, follow this link.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "description": "A Blog post by FINAL_Bench on Hugging Face",
    "fullText": "Authors: Taebong Kim, Minsik Kim, Sunyoung Choi, Jaewon Jang\nDataset: FINAL-Bench/Metacognitive | 100 Tasks | 15 Domains | Apache 2.0\n\nMMLU has crossed 90%. GPQA is saturating. HumanEval has hit its ceiling. Yet every single one of these benchmarks shares a common blind spot: none of them has ever measured whether AI can recognize its own errors and correct them.\n\nCognitive psychology calls this ability metacognition. It is the real dividing line between human experts and novices, and a prerequisite for AGI. When a physician catches a misdiagnosis and changes the treatment plan, when a scientist revises a hypothesis after unexpected results — the essence of these actions is metacognition.\n\nFINAL Bench (Frontier Intelligence Nexus for AGI-Level Verification) is the first benchmark to systematically measure this capability.\n\nWhere existing benchmarks ask \"Did you get the right answer?\", FINAL Bench asks \"What did you do when you got it wrong?\"\n\nFirst, we separate \"saying\" from \"fixing.\" Among our 5-axis rubric, MA (Metacognitive Accuracy) measures the declarative ability to say \"I might be wrong,\" while ER (Error Recovery) measures the procedural ability to actually detect and correct errors. This separation directly maps to the monitoring-control model of Nelson & Narens (1990) in cognitive psychology and is a first in AI benchmarking.\n\nSecond, every task embeds a hidden cognitive trap. Confirmation bias, anchoring, base-rate neglect — cognitive biases established in psychology are deliberately planted across all 100 tasks. We observe the model's process of \"falling into and climbing out of\" these traps. Tasks span 15 domains (mathematics, medicine, ethics, philosophy, economics, and more), 8 TICOS metacognitive types, and 3 difficulty grades.\n\nThird, we isolate causal effects through two conditions. Baseline is a single API call with no self-correction prompting. MetaCog applies a three-phase self-correction scaffold (initial reasoning, critical self-review, corrective revision). This follows the same logic as placebo-controlled clinical trials.\n\nScoring uses a tri-model LLM-as-Judge ensemble (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro). Cross-validation with human annotators on a 20-task subset confirmed Cohen's kappa = 0.87.\n\nWe evaluated 9 SOTA models across 100 expert-level tasks: GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek-V3.2, Kimi K2.5, and four others.\n\nThe MetaCog scaffold produces a mean gain of +14.05 points. 94.8% of this gain comes from Error Recovery alone.\n\nThe remaining four axes contribute a combined 5.2%. The bottleneck to AGI-level performance is not knowledge, not reasoning — it is self-correction alone.\n\nAll 9 models, without exception, satisfy MA > ER at Baseline.\n\nBaseline mean: MA = 0.694 vs. ER = 0.302 (Gap = 0.392)\n\nThe ability to verbalize uncertainty is substantial; the ability to actually correct errors is less than half. When the MetaCog scaffold is applied, ER jumps by +0.533 while MA moves only +0.035 under the same conditions. A 15x differential. The two capabilities are independent.\n\nThis is the first large-scale quantitative evidence of the declarative-procedural dissociation in AI — a 40-year-old open question in cognitive psychology. The phenomenon mirrors a well-documented clinical pattern: physicians who say \"this diagnosis is uncertain\" yet do not change the treatment plan. Today, all 9 of the world's leading AI models exhibit this exact behavior.\n\nBaseline score and MetaCog gain are strongly anticor\n\nClaude Opus 4.6, which recorded the lowest Baseline, showed the largest gain (Delta = +20.13). Kimi K2.5, with the highest Baseline, showed the smallest gain (Delta = +9.83). Models with higher intrinsic self-correction benefit less from external scaffolding.\n\nNotable: Claude Opus 4.6 rises from Baseline rank 9 to MetaCog rank 5 — the highest scaffold receptivity of any model. Kimi K2.5 maintains rank 1 in both conditions but shows the smallest gain, consistent with its already-elevated intrinsic ER (0.450).\n\nModels with high MA and low ER represent the most dangerous safety profile. They sound humble — \"I'm not entirely confident about this\" — while failing to self-correct. Users perceive reliability where none exists.\n\nAll 9 SOTA models currently match this profile. The MA-ER Gap is the first metric to quantitatively identify this risk.\n\nComposition: 100 tasks / 15 domains / 8 TICOS types / 3 grades / 12 fields per task\n\nFINAL Bench: Measuring Functional Metacognitive Reasoning in Large Language Models\nTaebong Kim, Minsik Kim, Sunyoung Choi, Jaewon Jang\nCurrently under review at a leading international AI venue.\n\nFuture directions include L2 layer measurement via open-source model logit entropy analysis, expanded multi-judge and human cross-validation, and periodic task pool refresh to prevent contamination.\n\nAGI without metacognition is driving with your eyes closed.\nFINAL Bench is the first tool to tell apart what AI truly knows from what it merely pretends to know.\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/FINAL-Bench/Metacognitive\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/FINAL-Bench/Leaderboard\n\n·\n Sign up or\n log in to comment",

    "fullText": "Briton Sandy Ryan became a two-weight world champion with a hard-fought points win over Karla Ramos Zamora in Nottingham, claiming the vacant WBC light-welterweight title.\n\nThe 32-year-old was below her best in a high-tempo contest against the awkward Mexican at the Motorpoint Arena.\n\nZamora's relentless output made several rounds difficult to score, but Ryan's cleaner counters proved decisive with the judges.\n\nScores of 95-95, 97-93 and 97-93 gave the Derby fighter a majority decision.\n\n\"I knew Zamora was going to be tough, but my lord she is tough,\" Ryan said. \"I think I broke my right hand in round three and from there it became a bit more messy.\n\n\"I made it hard work for myself. But it's because she's tough as well.\"\n\nA former welterweight world champion, Ryan improves her record to nine wins, three defeats and one draw.\n\nShe was fighting on the undercard of Leigh Wood v Josh Warrington, who meet in their rematch later on Saturday.\n\nWood v Warrington 2: Ryan becomes two-weight world champion - listen\n\nThe Uber-driving English champion & his 30-year fight for a passport\n\nBenn joining Zuffa 'dagger in the heart' for Hearn\n\nRyan returned to the world stage after considering retirement following back-to-back defeats by Mikaela Mayer.\n\nShe lost her WBO welterweight title in a close decision in September 2024 and was beaten again in their March 2025 rematch.\n\nRyan sprinted to the ring at 19:20 GMT to a quarter-full 8,000-seat arena, though a vocal pocket of Derby fans cut through the quiet.\n\nThe fight started at a quick pace. Zamora - fighting at world level for the first time - pressed forward and targeted the body.\n\nRyan responded with a sharp left hook in the second but was forced onto the back foot as Zamora kept the pressure on.\n\nAlthough Ryan was landing with the cleaner counters, Zamora was more effective with her inside work. By halfway, it was tighter than expected.\n\nBruised around the eyes, Ryan traded in the seventh as blood streamed from Zamora's nose, the visitor edging the exchanges.\n\nRyan boxed behind the jab in the ninth before they ended toe-to-toe, swinging at close range.\n\nAt the final bell, a case could be made for either fighter, or a draw.\n\nThe win, gritty rather than pretty, puts Ryan back in contention.\n\nUndisputed champion Katie Taylor holds the division's other belts but has yet to confirm her next move. At welterweight, unified champion Lauren Price may loom as a future target.\n\nA crossover bout with former MMA champion Cris Cyborg - now 5-0 in professional boxing - has also been previously mooted.\n\nEarlier in the night, Bilal Fawaz became British and Commonwealth light-middleweight champion by dethroning Ishmael Davis in a close contest.\n\nDavis, 30, started well and landed the more crisp and cleaner punches with Fawaz guilty of too much showboating and theatrics.\n\nBut Fawaz, 37, upped his punch output and took advantage in the second half as Davis tired.\n\nThe judges scored it 114-114, 115-113 and 115-114.\n\nNigerian-born Fawaz adds the British and Commonwealth titles to his collection, though he continues the fight for a British passport and is currently not able to fight or travel abroad.\n\nFawaz, who was trafficked to the UK as a teenager and after escaping a traumatic beginning to life, is now married and a father of two children, as well as working as an Uber driver.\n\n\"I know I'm 37 years old and I don't have much time. If I don't capitalise on what I have now, my dream will slip away. This is just the beginning, I am ready. I want it all,\" he said.\n\n\"It's sensational. It's overwhelming.\"\n\n\"I'm not a domestic fighter,\" he said. \"It's just that nobody gave me a chance. Eddie [Hearn] gave me a chance and I've proved him right ever since.\n\n\"Now I need to make some money and feed my family.\"\n\nWithout a passport, Fawaz cannot travel abroad to accept any world title opportunities outside of the UK.\n\n\"Get this man a passport,\" promoter Eddie Hearn added.\n\nAlso on the undercard in Nottingham, Molly McCann claimed her third professional win by outpointing Beata Dudek, while teenagers Leo Atang and Tiah Mai Ayton continued their unbeaten runs.\n\nHeavyweight Atang, 19, stopped Dan Garber inside a minute to make it five from five, and Ayton, also 19, went the distance for the first time in her fifth bout, defeating Catherine Tacone Ramos on points.\n\nPopular heavyweight Dave Allen returned to winning ways with a first-round stoppage of Karim Berredjem.

    "fullText": "Tries: Walters, Eckersley, Eseh, Field 2, French Goals: Keighran 5\n\nWigan Warriors cruised past Hull FC to claim a second successive win at the start of the 2026 Super League season in a dominant display at the Brick Community Stadium.\n\nThe home side raced into a 24-point lead at the break, scoring four unanswered tries, as their bid to regain the Super League title from Hull KR continues to take shape.\n\nSam Walters, Zach Eckersley, Sam Eseh and Jai Field all crossed to effectively put the result beyond doubt before half-time.\n\nHull failed to back up their victory over new boys Bradford Bulls in a disappointing performance as tries from Bevan French, and a second from Field, after the break added further gloss to Warriors' win before Hull grabbed a late consolation through Harvie Hill.\n\nIt did not take long for Warriors to assert their dominance when a high kick to the right corner was well competed for by Eckersley and Walters was in the right place at the right time to collect and dive over from close range in the fifth minute.\n\nEckersley then turned from provider to scorer when he got in at the right corner following a flowing Warriors move as Hull struggled to cope with the hosts' blistering start.\n\nFull-back Field then thought he had got in on the act - breaking through a loose Hull tackle - to dart over before the quarter-hour mark but Hull received a reprieve when video referee Aaron Moore disallowed the try as Liam Farrell was pulled up for an obstruction on Will Pryce.\n\nThe visitors then became the architects of their own downfall when Harvey Barron dropped the ball in front of his own posts, allowing ex-Hull loanee Eseh to pounce and dive over from close in.\n\nA beautiful sidestep from Field created a huge gap in the Black and Whites' back field before crawling over for Wigan's fourth try.\n\nWithin four minutes of the restart, French squirmed through a limp challenge on the right edge to dive over in clinical and trademark fashion and Adam Keighran comfortably slotted the extras.\n\nMatt Peet's side did not take their foot off the gas despite their huge advantage and Liam Marshall looked to find captain Farrell - who would have had a walk-in - but the ball was well intercepted by Arthur Romano.\n\nHull's Liam Knight was sent to the bin with 10 minutes remaining for a dangerous challenge and Warriors grabbed their sixth try of the night immediately after when Keighran juggled the ball to Field, who dived over for his second.\n\nThe match became 12-a-side soon after when Keighran received a yellow card for a late shot on Pryce and ex-Wigan prop Hill grabbed his first try for his new club to put a blot on Warriors' clean sheet.\n\nThe match ended on a sour note when Pryce suffered what looked like a serious knee injury as he was helped off the field.\n\nWigan coach Matt Peet told Sky Sports:\n\n\"Pleased with the result and aspects of the performance. [We] could certainly have been better, and we will be, but I certainly would have taken that on the way here.\n\n\"We did some good things. It's important not to get carried away but there were some good signs, both sides of the ball, particularly in the first half.\n\n\"I thought we could have finished the game a bit better, just a little bit more discipline and regarding turnovers. Those are the only things I'm looking at tomorrow morning.\"\n\nHull FC coach John Cartwright told BBC Radio Humberside:\n\n\"We were up against it from the word go. They were very good and we weren't so good.\n\n\"Right from the kick-off I think they rolled down the field too easy. I take responsibility for that as much as the players. For whatever reason, we just weren't up to it.\"\n\nOn Liam Knight's yellow card: \"It was just plain dumb, stupid. I'll address that with Liam. On the dumb scale, it's probably a 10 [out of 10].\"\n\nOn Will Pryce's injury: \"[The] Doctor's had a look at him. It's more hopeful at the moment that it's not serious but it's way too early. We'll get some scans going and we'll see from there.\"\n\nWigan: Field; Eckersley, Keighran, Farrell, Marshall; French, Smith; Havard, O'Neill, Thompson, Nsemba, Walters, Ellis.\n\nInterchanges: Mago, Partington, Eseh, Forber.\n\nHull FC: Pryce; Barron, Romano, Litten, Martin; Cust, Sezer; Knight, Bourouh, Hill, Batchelor, Cartwright, Aydin.\n\nInterchanges: Lisone, Bailey, Fash, Kemp.",

    "fullText": "Scotland captain Sione Tuipulotu hailed his side's \"ugly\" Six Nations victory in Cardiff as they earned a fourth straight win over Wales for the first time in 99 years.\n\nOff the back of last weekend's superb triumph over England at Murrayfield, all the talk was whether Gregor Townsend's side could back up that performance in a game in which they arrived as heavy favourites.\n\nThey went into half-time 17-5 down though as Wales - now winless in 14 Six Nations matches - dominated the breakdown and the collisions, roared on by their home support.\n\nSecond-half tries from Finn Russell, Darcy Graham and George Turner earned the Scots a nail-biting 23-26 win - one that keeps their title hopes alive and the wolves from Townsend's door.\n\n\"We dug deep,\" Tuipulotu said. \"We did what we needed to do to win ugly.\"\n\nPlayer of the match Rory Darge backed up his captain's sentiment.\n\n\"It's hard to get wins on the road and that was a gritty one,\" he said.\n\n\"It's hard to wrestle back 17-5 down and we did that. Massively proud of everyone.\"\n\n'Scotland's terrible beauty reverses the narrative on extraordinary day'\n\nScotland battle back for Six Nations win over Wales\n\nThere was little Scottish grit in the opening stages as Wales raced out of the blocks and established a healthy lead thanks to Sam Costelow's boot and tries from Rhys Carre and Josh Adams.\n\nTownsend turned to his bench early to try to arrest Welsh momentum, with Pierre Schoeman and Josh Bayliss introduced before half-time.\n\nBayliss was superb and fellow replacements George Horne and Graham brought energy after the break as Scotland built momentum following a sloppy start to the second half.\n\nAfter one of many Scotland line-outs went astray and the usually reliable Kyle Steyn knocked on, the visitors went through 27 phases before Russell darted over.\n\nIt was a spell of composure and cutting edge that Scotland desperately needed - qualities they have lacked when needed in recent times.\n\n\"It's something we've worked a lot on in this campaign - having composure and being calm in the 22,\" fly-half Finn Russell said. \"Now it's only going to the backs when it's on.\"\n\nThe winning try was another example of that new-found calm. A successfully executed line-out, a perfectly set up maul and Turner driving over.\n\n\"They still didn't play particularly well,\" former Scotland prop Peter Wright said. \"But they showed grit, determination and composure.\n\n\"Did we deserve it? In the end, just. We showed bottle and that's what you want.\"\n\nAfter the opening defeat by Italy and a disappointing autumn campaign, questions have been asked of Townsend and whether he has taken this team as far as he can after nine years at the helm.\n\nHowever, another Calcutta Cup triumph strengthened his case and his team showed a different side to their game in the Welsh capital.\n\n\"In some ways, this is more important or more impressive than last week when they were in control,\" former Scotland full-back Chris Paterson said.\n\n\"Gregor Townsend was asked difficult questions and made brilliant coaching decisions to introduce players quickly.\n\n\"It's an excellent win on the road for Scotland.\"\n\nFor all the post-match talk of Scotland's grit, bottle and composure, the turning point was a combination of opportunism and a lapse in Welsh concentration.\n\nAfter Jarrod Evans slotted a penalty for the hosts to extend their lead, Russell took the restart quickly into space and Graham raced on to it to score.\n\nWales wing Gabriel Hamer-Webb allowed Graham to run beyond him, not realising that team-mate James Botham had turned his back on the ball and allowed it to bounce.\n\n\"Credit to Scotland for being brave,\" former captain John Barclay said. \"The game swung on the Darcy Graham try.\"\n\nWales head coach Steve Tandy - formerly Scotland defence coach - raised his arms in dismay in the stands, powerless to stop such a preventable try.\n\n\"A lucky bounce I'd say and they weren't expecting it,\" said Russell, when asked for his perspective.\n\n\"That will be a frustrating one for Steve Tandy - he knows that's something I look for and Darcy scoring is a coach killer.\"\n\nTownsend praised the awareness of his fly-half and acknowledged the impact it had on the rest of the contest.\n\n\"That was a big moment in the game,\" he said. \"Credit goes to Finn for seeing that space and Darcy being alive to it.\"\n\nAfter their hugely disappointing loss in Rome, Scotland's championship chances were all but written off.\n\nYet, England's drubbing by Ireland means the Scots lead the standings on 11 points before unbeaten France host the Italians on Sunday.\n\nScotland welcome France to Edinburgh in two weeks' time knowing a third straight win would set up a date with destiny in Dublin.\n\nThat is still a long way away and France have looked imperious to date, but Scotland are in with a shot.\n\n\"We're still in the championship,\" Townsend said. \"That's all that counts.\n\n\"Today showed - not just our game - that anything can happen in the championship.\n\n\"We'll be underdogs against France and we know we'll have to play our best rugby.\"",

    "fullText": "The speed skating events at the 2030 Winter Olympics will take place outside host nation France, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe Games, known as French Alps 2030, will be mostly spread across south-east France with venue clusters in Nice, Briancon, Savoie and Haut-Savoie.\n\nHowever, the speed skating will take place in pre-existing venues in either Turin in northern Italy, or Heerenveen in the Netherlands.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Games organisers do not want to build new venues that would not have a definite legacy in the host region.\n\nEdgar Grospiron, president of the French Alps 2030 organising committee, said holding the speed skating outside France was a condition agreed with the IOC upon becoming hosts of the Games.\n\n\"This decision has already been taken, so the organising committee has to go on what has already been decided,\" he told a media conference in Milan on Saturday, the day before the 2026 hosts hand over responsibility for the Games.\n\n\"This is so that the Games in the French Alps can be as we want them to be.\n\n\"For the first time we will have a Games with a discipline in another European country. This will be new; we will see if other Games do it.\"\n\nHolding events away from the host city or region is not unprecedented in the Olympics. At Paris 2024, the surfing events were held on the Pacific island of Tahiti - approximately 10,000 miles away from France.\n\nBut Tahiti, an island in French Polynesia, is an overseas territory of France, while the 2030 speed skating will be held in a different independent nation.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGrospiron said about 15% of sports and venues for 2030 have not yet been decided, but that details will be confirmed by June this year.\n\nHe said figure skating - which does not currently have a confirmed location - will take place in Nice, as will curling and ice hockey.\n\nGrospiron also said they will decide on which new sports, if any, will be added to the programme and if any events will be removed.\n\nThe future of Nordic combined - the only event at Milan-Cortina 2026 not to have a women's competition - has not yet been confirmed.\n\nSki mountaineering, which made its debut in 2026, is yet to be confirmed as a medal event in the French Alps.\n\n\"New sports are at the eart of our concerns, this will need to be broached to then decide what our venue plan is like and has to be validated by June by the IOC,\" Grospiron said.\n\n\"We will not do this alone; we will do this hand in hand with federations and venues.\n\n\"For Nordic combined, this is at the helm of the IOC. We will follow the recommendations of the IOC. We are there to listen, to help us finalise our venue plan.\"\n\nThere have been reports of infighting, external among the 2030 organising committee, with director general Cyril Linette allegedly departing amid differences with Grospiron, as well as budget cuts.\n\nGrospiron said they have \"little time, little money\" but were confident the Games would be delivered successfully.\n\n\"We talk every day about wanting to make these Games a success,\" he said. \"The organising committee needs serenity, continuity, then we will show what our teams can do. We are very proud of the work we have been able to do.\n\n\"We know we have very little time, little money. But we can deliver a Games that will honour our vision and ambition.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Ireland issue a defiant response to talk they are a fading force, with a record-breaking Six Nations win over England at Allianz Stadium.",
    "fullText": "There was a moment, deep into England's nightmare at Allianz Stadium, that summed up the ferocity and intensity that fuelled one of the great Ireland performances.\n\nWith a famous Six Nations scalp on English soil already in the bag, Ireland surrendered possession with a rare mistake. Marcus Smith intercepted Jack Crowley's attempted pass and off he went.\n\nEngland were 42-14 down, but Stuart McCloskey still wasn't prepared to let Smith out of his sight. Even with a mountain of work already behind him, the seemingly indefatigable Ulster centre hared after the England replacement, chased him down and barrelled him into touch.\n\nIt prompted one of the loudest Irish cheers on an afternoon soundtracked by them and was highlighted by head coach Andy Farrell in his post-match remarks as evidence of the unrelenting appetite that drove Ireland to a record 42-21 win in the home of English rugby.\n\n\"Honestly, I said it to the lads, I didn't care whether we won or lost today, just whether we grew as a group, because we know where we want to go to and it just so happens that to the people of Ireland winning does matter and it brings a bit of joy on everyone's face,\" said Farrell.\n\n\"For them, I mean the crowd, the people that turned up, it was immense. I hope everyone at home is just as proud as well.\"\n\nWhat went wrong for England in nightmare defeat?\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\n'Special day' - Farrell revels in record Irish win\n\nAfter being mercilessly pummelled by France a fortnight ago, Ireland arrived in south-west London and showed the rugby world they're not quite done yet.\n\nOn Thursday, Farrell urged his players to \"fire a few shots\", and they responded to end England's nine-match winning run at home in ruthless fashion and ruin Maro Itoje's 100th cap.\n\nHeavily criticised for their passive, leggy display in Paris, Ireland rediscovered the defensive grit and attacking flair that propelled them to the top of the world rankings leading into the 2023 World Cup.\n\nThere were monumental performances all over the field.\n\nCaelan Doris produced one of his best displays as captain, Crowley impressed at fly-half, Rob Baloucoune delivered crucial moments at both ends of the field, and Josh van der Flier responded emphatically to being dropped for last week's win over Italy.\n\nBut no Irish player stood taller than Jamison Gibson-Park, who epitomised Ireland's desire to best England on both sides of the ball with a virtuoso display at scrum-half.\n\nThe British and Irish Lion, who said he sought feedback from the coaches after being benched against Italy, scored Ireland's first try, created the second for Baloucoune, and ended his day with a much-deserved player of the match award.\n\n\"I called it after a few of his first moments that he'd get man of the match,\" legendary Irish scrum-half Conor Murray said on the Ireland Rugby Social.\n\n\"He kept things quick, did what he does best. Tadhg Beirne was unbelievably sharp to give him the ball for that try and everything flowed after that. He was brilliant.\"\n\nOver the past 12 months, Ireland have struggled to carry the weight of expectation.\n\nDemolished at home by France in last year's Six Nations, double-digit losses to New Zealand and South Africa in November strengthened the argument that Farrell's side were being ushered away from rugby's top table.\n\nAnd while they cannot definitively settle that debate until the World Cup, Saturday's win should act as an important checkpoint on their journey to next year's tournament in Australia.\n\n\"In the camp in the lead-up to this, I know they were offended by the criticism and everyone saying this team's done,\" added Murray, who won 125 Ireland caps in a career that yielded five Six Nations titles.\n\n\"They came out and said, 'Lads, we're still here, this team is still class'.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's 80 minutes, but it's 80 minutes in one of the hardest places to come and play. We've been hammered here before and it's a tough place to pick yourself up from afterwards.\"\n\nThere is still much work to be done, of course. Scotland's dramatic late victory over Wales in the later Saturday kick-off leaves Ireland third in the table, two points behind Gregor Townsend's side.\n\nFrance, who face Italy on Sunday, are a point above Ireland. After a much-needed rest week, Ireland still need to beat Wales and Scotland at home and hope France slip up somewhere along the way.\n\nBut Farrell thought better of being sucked into any title talk in the immediate aftermath against England. For him, a continuation of the progression Ireland showed on Saturday stands above all else.\n\n\"What will be will be, we just need to move on after this,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a fallow week. We'll review the start of the competition and see how much we've grown.\n\n\"The important part for us is to be keep on doing that in the last two weeks, and what will be will be, really.\"",

Despite near-perfect performance on high-resource languages, existing systems remain brittle in low-resource and closely related language settings. We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon.

The network normally operates with 15,000 to 20,000 active devices. The attackers overwhelmed it by a factor of 39 to 1.\n\nFor three consecutive years, I2P has been hit with Sybil attacks every February.

When the 2026 attack began, most assumed it was the same state-sponsored operation continuing its annual disruption campaign. The assumption was wrong.\n\nThe attacker was identified as the Kimwolf botnet, an IoT botnet that infected millions of devices including streaming boxes and consumer routers throughout late 2025. Kimwolf is the same operation behind the record-setting 31.4 terabit per second DDoS attack in December 2025. The operators admitted on Discord they accidentally disrupted I2P while attempting to use the network as backup command-and-control infrastructure after security researchers destroyed over 550 of their primary C2 servers.\n\nThe I2P development team responded by shipping version 2.11.0 just six days after the attack began. The release includes hybrid ML-KEM plus X25519 post-quantum encryption enabled by default, making I2P one of the first production anonymity networks to ship post-quantum cryptography to all users.

    "fullText": "Tries: Carre, Adams Cons: Costelow 2 Pens: Costelow 2, Evans\n\nTries: Steyn, Russell, Graham, Turner Cons: Russell 3\n\nScotland battled back to inflict a heartbreaking Six Nations defeat on Wales in a thrilling game in Cardiff.\n\nGregor Townsend's side trailed 20-5 and 23-12 but rallied in the second half with a 74th-minute try from replacement hooker George Turner sealing the victory.\n\nIt was the first time Scotland had led in the game after earlier tries from wing Kyle Steyn, replacement Darcy Graham and fly-half Finn Russell, who finished with 11 points.\n\nThe Graham try proved the turning point following some Russell magic and a Welsh defensive lapse from a restart.\n\nWales had scored tries from prop Rhys Carre and Josh Adams with 10 points from fly-half Sam Costelow.\n\nSteve Tandy's side will be devastated after a much-improved performance but Wales' three-year Six Nations losing streak continues.\n\nScotland will win a first Triple Crown since 1990 if they can beat Ireland in Dublin on 14 March.\n\nReaction as Scotland complete Cardiff comeback\n\n'Wales were sleeping!' Scotland score try straight from kick-off\n\n'Heartbreaking, sad, disgrace' – Wales fans react to state of game\n\nAfter an opening-day defeat by Italy in Rome, Scotland have bounced back with two victories.\n\nScotland have not beaten England, Ireland and Wales in the same tournament for 36 years.\n\nThe question was could Scotland buck the recent trend by backing up the impressive 31-20 win against England. The answer was yes after Scotland had lost six of their seven matches directly played after a win against England.\n\nIt is the first time Scotland have won four successive games against Wales for 100 years and the first back-to-back away success in Cardiff since 1984.\n\nWales have dropped to 12th in the world rankings while Scotland have risen two places to seventh.\n\nWales were outstanding in parts but have still suffered 14 successive Six Nations defeats in a streak stretching back to a win against Italy in Rome in March 2023 - some 1,078 days.\n\nThey have also lost 11 consecutive home matches in the tournament since beating Scotland in February 2022 - a gap of 1,470 days.\n\nWales have suffered a 24th defeat in 26 games since October 2023 and they have only won game in 15 matches at the Principality Stadium.\n\nBut the Wales team restored pride in front of their home fans with an encouraging performance, as Tandy just fell short against the Scottish side he had been defence coach for almost six years.\n\nHome captain Dewi Lake said before the game they had to get the Principality Stadium rocking. They certainly did that in front of 70,649.\n\nThere is a fallow week now before Townsend's side host France and face the trip to Dublin. Wales will also travel to play Ireland on 6 March before entertaining Italy eight days later.\n\nTandy's response to heavy opening defeats against England and France, in which Wales conceded 15 tries and 102 points, was to make four changes.\n\nUncapped Leicester wing Gabriel Hamer-Webb, Scarlets fly-half Sam Costelow , Dragons second-row Ben Carter and Scarlets flanker Taine Plumtree coming in for Ellis Mee, Dan Edwards, Adam Beard and Olly Cracknell.\n\nWales made shocking starts in the opening two games but ensured that was not the case on this occasion.\n\nPlumtree and Hamer-Webb both picked up injuries in the opening two minutes. Hamer-Webb was forced off briefly with a bloody nose before Plumtree was permanently replaced by James Botham because of a shoulder problem.\n\nWales' discipline was again poor in the opening exchanges with two soft penalties, before Joe Hawkins was sent to the bunker for a high tackle on Scotland flanker Gregor Brown, who had moved from lock to the back row from the victory over England to replace the injured Jamie Ritchie.\n\nWing Josh Adams made a couple of important early interventions with a crucial tackle on Scotland centre Huw Jones followed by a vital interception.\n\nWales rallied with 14 men and after a searing break from scrum-half Tomos Williams, the home side produced an identical successful tap penalty move to last week when Carre dived over after the initial drive from Lake.\n\nHawkins' card remained yellow as it was deemed a passive tackle but it was still an 11th sin-binning in Tandy's seven games in charge.\n\nScotland took advantage of the extra back with a sweeping move that was finished by Steyn.\n\nHawkins returned and his fellow Scarlets centre Eddie James, along with Lake, Carre and flanker Alex Mann, laid the foundations for Adams to cross for his 24th Wales try.\n\nCostelow, who was starting his first game since July 2025 with Edwards having played the past seven games, converted from the touchline.\n\nBotham was outstanding after his early introduction and a turnover laid the foundations for a Costelow penalty.\n\nScotland made a couple of early tactical substitutions as prop Pierre Schoeman and back rower Josh Bayliss came on for Nathan McBeth and Max Williamson, with Brown reverting to lock.\n\nAfter another storming Steyn break, a vital Mann turnover forced a penalty as Wales led 17-5 at half-time, the first time the home side had led under Tandy at the interval.\n\nThe 57,744 crowd against France was Wales' lowest home attendance in the Six Nations, but the Principality Stadium atmosphere was electric with a spectacular half-time show.\n\nCostelow slotted over his second penalty early to extend the deficit to 15 points.\n\nScotland showed the composure they had been lacking in the first half with a 27-phase move finished by Russell.\n\nWales lost Costelow to a leg injury with Jarrod Evans coming on and his first act was to slot over a simple penalty.\n\nScotland also made a raft of replacements, including the introduction of Edinburgh wing Graham for Van der Merwe.\n\nGraham made an immediate impact as the visitors capitalised on an unforgivable Welsh error and a moment of Russell ingenuity.\n\nBotham did not react quickly enough from the restart and Graham gathered a quick Russell kick-off and out-sprinted Hamer-Webb to equal Van der Merwe's Scotland try-scoring record. Russell converted from the touchline and the momentum shifted.\n\nWales scrum-half Williams was penalised for an illegal clearout when Wales had been initially been awarded a kickable penalty.\n\nThe decision was reversed with the home side denied a chance to go seven points clear.\n\nScotland captain Sione Tuipulotu then produced a strong tackle on Wales full-back Louis Rees-Zammit that yielded a penalty for the visitors but they could not initially take advantage.\n\nThe immense pressure was mounting on the Welsh defence with replacement Turner going over for the bonus-point try, with any hints of obstruction ignored by the officials.\n\nRussell slotted over the conversion and his late missed penalty was irrelevant as Scotland celebrated and Wales were left forlorn.\n\nWales: Rees-Zammit; Hamer-Webb, James, Hawkins, Adams; Costelow, T Williams; Carre, Lake (capt), Francis, Jenkins, Carter, Plumtree, Mann, Wainwright\n\nReplacements: Elias, Smith, Griffin, F Thomas, Botham, Hardy, J Evans, Murray\n\nScotland: Kinghorn; Steyn, H Jones, Tuipulotu (capt), van der Merwe; Russell, White; McBeth, Cherry, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, G Brown, Darge, M Fagerson\n\nReplacements: Turner, Schoeman, Mills, Gilchrist, Bayliss, G Horne, Jordan, Graham\n\nAssistant referees: Karl Dickson (RFU), Adam Leal (RFU)",

    "title": "Red cards and poor home form - Chelsea 'set fire to points'",
    "description": "Chelsea have more red cards than any side in the Premier League this season, and boss Liam Rosenior says they have \"set fire\" to points.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has inherited many of the problems that afflicted Enzo Maresca's side before him.\n\nAfter Burnley's 93rd‑minute equaliser in their 1-1 draw, Chelsea became the Premier League leaders for dropping points at home - 17 this season.\n\nThey also now have a league‑high six red cards this term, following Wesley Fofana's dismissal in the 72nd minute.\n\nThat red card ultimately led to Chelsea's subsequent collapse after Joao Pedro opened the scoring, with Rosenior lamenting that his side have \"set fire to four points\" after drawing 2-2 at home to Leeds in their previous league match.\n\n\"There's an inquest after every game whether we win or lose,\" Rosenior added.\n\nHowever, this is the first result to prompt such an angry reaction from the manager, who was appointed after Maresca left the club on New Year's Day following a falling-out with the hierarchy.\n\nRosenior continued: \"I'm learning about the players. I'm learning about the people you can lean on when things aren't going your way and you need to see a game out. That's something we need to address very quickly.\"\n\nThere was further frustration over goalscorer Zian Flemming being given a free header in the centre of Chelsea's box, with Burnley substitute Jacob Bruun Larsen missing a similar chance minutes later.\n\n\"A marking assignment was missed,\" Rosenior said. \"I'm not here to throw players under the bus - I will always protect my players, and I'll deal with it during the week.\n\n\"But there was a player assigned that duty who marked the wrong man.\"\n\nChelsea have equalled their highest number of red cards in a single Premier League season, matching the 2007‑08 campaign - but with 11 games still to play.\n\nOnly away at Nottingham Forest have Chelsea claimed all three points after going down to 10 men, holding on following an 87th‑minute dismissal.\n\nDefeats against Manchester United, Brighton and Fulham can largely be attributed to red cards earlier in those matches, while Chelsea rallied well after Moises Caicedo was sent off in the home draw with Arsenal in November.\n\nThe pattern is clear - Chelsea are suffering because of their lack of discipline. They are also a team accustomed to collecting yellow cards.\n\nThey sit bottom of the Fair Play table with 86 points, having received 60 yellow cards this season. They were second-bottom last season and bottom the season before.\n\nIt is hard not to link the disciplinary record to the age profile of the squad. Chelsea have not fielded a player over the age of 28 all season and have the youngest squad in the Premier League - a profile deliberately built by the club's hierarchy.\n\nHowever, Rosenior does not \n\n\"I think youth is one thing, accountability is another,\" he said. \"I'm accountable. I'm the head coach, I'm the manager of the team. I'm responsible for every result and every performance we have. We need players you can rely on in the moment to do their job.\n\n\"I know what we need to get there. It's not down to youth, it's down to assessing the players and identifying the ones you can rely on in difficult moments.\"\n\nRosenior also refused to single out Fofana and pointed out that the majority of red cards this season came before his appointment. Maresca himself was sent off for celebrating a last‑minute winner against Liverpool.\n\n\"Our discipline since I've come in - which is what I can speak about - has been very good,\" added Rosenior.\n\nChelsea have dropped a league‑high 17 points from winning positions at home and 19 in total - the second‑worst record in the Premier League behind West Ham on 20.\n\nIt is another area affected not only by red cards but also by an inability to finish teams off and defensive lapses, particularly from set-pieces.\n\nChelsea have conceded a league‑high 13.54 expected goals from set-pieces this season, resulting in 11 goals against.\n\nIt is unsurprising, therefore, that the combination of dead‑ball specialist Ward‑Prowse and an aerial presence such as Flemming contributed to the equaliser.\n\n\"Set plays are massive in the Premier League, they're so important. Our record this season, defending set plays, is not at the level required for us to achieve what we want to achieve, and that's something I need to address,\" Rosenior said.\n\nThere may also be a broader mentality issue, which again could be linked to the youthfulness of the squad - particularly within Chelsea's leadership group.\n\nAsked whether Chelsea have enough leaders, Rosenior simply replied \"Yes\", before adding: \"I think there are certain values you need to have in your team.\n\n\"The best teams, the teams that win titles - which is where we want to get to - win games 1-0 when they probably haven't played at their best.\n\n\"That should have been at least a 1-0 today. Even with 10 men for 25 minutes, that should have been a 1-0 at the least. I know what we need to get there. It's not down to youth, it's about assessing the players and identifying the ones you can rely on in difficult moments.\"\n\nChelsea were booed off at full‑time, and Rosenior's reaction may signal the end of a brief period of calm around Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt remains a promising start for the Englishman in his 11 games in charge, but he walked into a club already experiencing a febrile atmosphere, with anti‑ownership chants growing louder and fringe protests beginning to move into the mainstream.\n\nIt promises to be an interesting few weeks for Chelsea, with Arsenal, Aston Villa and Newcastle to come in a tougher run of Premier League fixtures.\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Heart of Midlothian head coach Derek McInnes suggests history shows narrow wins can be the difference between success and failure as his Scottish Premiership leaders beat Falkirk.",
    "fullText": "Watch: Hearts v Falkirk - Sportscene highlights\n\nIt might not have been pretty, it was by a mere single goal, but Heart of Midlothian's victory over Falkirk is of the kind head coach Derek McInnes believes could prove to be \"the bedrock of success\" for his Scottish Premiership leaders.\n\nIt was much needed, given that last weekend's 4-2 defeat by Rangers allowed the hosts to narrow the gap at the top to two points.\n\nHearts returned to winning ways on Saturday, but it was far from comfortable against high-flying Falkirk.\n\nRecent signing Islam Chesnokov's toe-poke on the stroke of half-time was all that split the sides, leaving McInnes to admit he felt the \"anxiety\" at Tynecastle.\n\nThere was a slight nervousness around the Edinburgh stadium ahead of the game. On top of that defeat at Ibrox against their nearest challengers, Falkirk were returning to the scene of their penalty shoot-out win in the Scottish Cup just a few weeks ago.\n\nHowever, Hearts rode the wave of emotions, and dealt with the latest raft of injuries, to extend their lead at the top to five points before Rangers face bottom side Livingston on Sunday.\n\n\"Sometimes those 1-0 wins are the bedrock of any success a team can have,\" McInnes said. \"I think that's been demonstrated in history.\"\n\nMore of those will be more than welcome considering their title rivals are beginning to motor.\n\nDanny Rohl's Rangers have lost just once - away to Porto in the Europa League - in 14 outings since losing at Tynecastle in December.\n\nReigning champions Celtic, just six behind Hearts with two games in hand, have lost once in 11, albeit a bruising 4-1 Europa League loss at home to Stuttgart on Thursday, and rekindled their habit of vital late goals under interim manager Martin O'Neill.\n\nMotherwell, 10 behind with a game in hand, will surely also have a say in the destiny of the title given they have lost once in their latest 10.\n\nHearts' three wins in their latest seven outings are not quite as impressive, and McInnes admitted: \"The first half, there was a 20-25 minute period where we looked really anxious.\n\n\"Our out-of-possession stuff was good the whole game, but our in-possession stuff needed to be better.\"\n\nHowever, the Hearts boss thought that, overall, his side coped well with John McGlynn's dangerous Bairns.\n\n\"We were far better in the second half than we were first,\" he said. \"We were the team that looked more likely to score a second goal in the second half.\n\n\"I watch Falkirk often enough and they normally pepper teams, they normally put endless crosses in the box, they normally create so many chances.\n\n\"Very rarely do they not score. But it wasn't really like that. The second half, we were comfortable enough, we kept them away at arm's length.\n\n\"There were a lot of people tipping Falkirk to come here and win, but I thought we thoroughly deserved the win.\"\n\nBlair Spittal, drafted into the starting XI at the last minute following an injury to Ageu in the warm-up, agreed.\n\n\"It was a bit nervy at times, we made it hard for ourselves, but at this point of the season, it doesn't matter how you do it as long as you win,\" the midfielder said.\n\n\"We know the position we're in and it's important we don't look too far ahead. We just need to take care of ourselves.\"\n\nAs BBC Sportsound pundit Rory Loy suggested: \"They can tick that one off. Pressure well and truly applied.\"\n\nOver to Rangers in West Lothian and Celtic as they host Hibernian on Sunday.\n\nMcInnes added that \"of course\" it would be nice to be able to sit back and watch Hearts' rivals trying to reduce the deficit again, but he stressed: \"You can't get too obsessed.\n\n\"If you depend on others, you normally get let down. I'm just concentrating on my own team.\n\n\"We'll just deal with our own business as we go along and next Saturday's another chance to do it.\"\n\nWith five games until the Premiership splits into two halves for the final five games of the season, and no room for any more dropped points, it will no doubt be another case of any win will do.\n\nKris: A tough watch at times, but a win is a win is a win. Delighted Chesny [Chesnokov] got his goal. Hopefully he kicks on.\n\nRichard: Harry Milne in the second half, after Blair Spittal in the first half, provided the drive and the buzz around the field. Falkirk were competent and compact, Hearts were more expansive and were the slightly-better side, enough to deserve the win.\n\nAgeu injured again? About time players came with a warranty that they'll keep working for X miles or months or whatever, or they'll be repaired for free.\n\nSteve: Given our squad, Pierre Landry Kabore is never our number nine. Kabangu is worth a start or another Jamestown dud. The midfield is pedestrian and so fortunate to get this result.\n\nI fear, although getting three points, we are struggling to get results. Too many Jamestown duds.\n\nVisit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Hearts news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

In the first half we were dominant – we applied pressure and attacked them.\n\n\"We've spoken a lot about staying in moments and didn't do that for the full 80 minutes, which is why the scoreboard went against us.\n\n\"We probably did enough to win the game, which makes it so tough.\"\n\nScotland battle back for Six Nations win over Wales\n\nReaction as Scotland complete Cardiff comeback\n\n'Kick of the age' - 40 years since Thorburn's monster\n\nTandy enjoyed an autumn win against Japan but was agonisingly close to a first statement victory of his reign.\n\nWales led at half-time for the first time since under his charge and were 20-5 and 23-12 in front at times of the second half. But ultimately they were left with just a losing bonus-point.\n\n\"I'm bitterly disappointed not to win the game but have massive pride in the group,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"That was a step in the right direction but we've got to be better next time. There was a lot to like in the first half with how we attacked the game. That was excellent.\"\n\nAfter French fans took over Principality Stadium in round two, Tandy hailed the impact of the home backing from a crowd of 70,649 inside the Principality Stadium.\n\n\"The support today was incredible. There are lots of questions asked about the crowds, but they were unbelievable,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Everyone felt it. The players gave them something to cheer about, but ultimately they got behind the team. It's a snapshot of what we want to be.\"\n\nScarlets pair Taine Plumtree and Sam Costelow look unlikely to play again in the tournament.\n\nBack-row Plumtree (shoulder) and fly-half Costelow (lower leg) are to undergo scans on Monday.\n\n\"Sam doesn't look good,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"He's been through a lot in his Wales career with not being involved in the autumn but we backed him to come back in and he really took that opportunity.\n\n\"He was fantastic with the way he drove the team forward in that first half. It's such a shame for him that it ended with injury.\"\n\nTandy was Scotland defence coach for six years and his gameplan earned the praise of his former boss.\n\n\"Tactically they were outstanding,\" said Gregor Townsend.\n\n\"Wales moved the ball quickly, played around the ruck which was tough to defend, their set-piece was excellent and defensively, which we probably hadn't seen from them. They targeted our breakdown and kept their width.\n\n\"They set up the team very well and they have some excellent players. We knew Wales would play well and knew the quality they have in the team.\n\n\"They deserved to be ahead and it took a huge effort to get back in the game and ahead on the scoreboard.\"",

    "fullText": "Home favourite Leigh Wood comfortably outpointed Josh Warrington in their grudge rematch at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena, securing a second victory over his British rival.\n\nWood dictated the tempo across 12 rounds against a frustrated, flat-footed Warrington.\n\nHe struggled to get his shots away as Wood cruised to a unanimous decision win with scores of 119-109, 119-109 and 117-111.\n\nWarrington said he would not \"rush\" any decision but suggested he may hang up the gloves after a fifth loss in 38 bouts.\n\n\"It's too tough a game to be turning up for an opponent and being second best,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"I'm a winner. The will to win is always going to be there but when something is missing it's too dangerous of a sport.\n\n\"I'm 35 now, I've got three beautiful kids at home and it's like how much do you keep on giving?\"\n\nThe 35-year-old 'Leeds Warrior' is a two-time featherweight world champion and stalwart of British boxing.\n\nWood, 37, is also a former featherweight world champion. He improves to 29 wins with four defeats and hinted this could be his last fight.\n\n\"What a fight to finish on if that is the last one. It's getting harder and harder to be away from my kids. They sacrifice as much as me,\" he said.\n\nTheir first fight in Sheffield had Warrington comfortably in control until a decisive Wood punch in the seventh round ended the contest.\n\nThe rivalry had only deepened since, reflected in the charged atmosphere of the sell-out 8,000-capacity arena as the football-loving fighters entered to songs of their respective clubs.\n\nWarrington walked out to the Leeds United anthem Marching On Together, which segued into his trademark Kaiser Chiefs' I Predict a Riot, but the travelling noise was outdone by the home crowd when Wood - wearing sunglasses and soaking in the moment - emerged to Nottingham Forest's Mull of Kintyre.\n\nWood edged a scrappy first round. Warrington responded with a sharp right hook and straight right in the second.\n\nThe home crowd sang \"Leigh Wood is one of our own\", as their man settled into a southpaw rhythm, slowing the pace and picking shots from range.\n\nHe landed a crisp combination in the fifth before Warrington drew blood from Wood's nose with a single right.\n\nBoth men had lost to Anthony Cacace since their first fight, raising the stakes for what felt like a last roll of the dice. Yet it was Warrington who looked the more faded former champion.\n\n\"Give them something to sing about,\" urged his father and trainer Sean O'Hagan, predicting Wood would tire.\n\nInstead, the bout drifted. Wood, hands low, invited pressure but Warrington could not capitalise. The lull in action seeped into the stands.\n\nWood and Warrington to consider retirement after rematch - reaction\n\nBriton Ryan becomes two-weight world champion\n\nThe sequel lacked the drama of their first fight. Instead, it became a question of who had more left in the tank.\n\nThe build-up to the rematch was intensely personal. Warrington described Wood as a \"slimy character\", while Wood called Warrington \"horrible\".\n\nWarrington likened his rival to a journeyman, and Wood fired back, branding him an area-level fighter.\n\nHow much of it was talk and how much genuine animosity matters little now - both can be celebrated for their achievements and standing in British boxing.\n\nA fight at the City Ground, home of Nottingham Forest, was always Wood's dream, but at this stage of his career it seems unlikely to come to fruition.\n\n\"If there is a great offer for the one place I want to fight [City Ground], I'd probably consider it,\" Wood said.\n\nHe added: \"I'm not coming out to get flattened out in front of my own crowd.\"\n\nShould he retire, he leaves a legacy as a resilient, powerful and entertaining fighter with memorable nights to his name. He will go down as a legend in his city.\n\nFor Warrington, this appears to be the final chapter. He debuted in 2009 and cemented his place on the global stage with high-profile victories over the likes of Lee Selby and Carl Frampton.\n\nHaving briefly retired in 2024, the lure of the big nights brought him back. But after this defeat, the fighter who once drove around Leeds in his rickety car trying to sell tickets can leave knowing he gave the sport everything he had.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana have spoken out on social media after both were sent racist abuse following the clubs' Premier League match on Saturday.\n\nChelsea's French defender Fofana, who was sent off for a second yellow card in the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, shared several screenshots of private messages he received on Instagram after the game.\n\nHe then posted a message which read: \"2026, it's still the same thing, nothing changes. These people are never punished.\n\n\"You create big campaigns against racism, but nobody actually does anything.\"\n\nEarlier Burnley's Tunisia international Mejbri shared an image of an offensive message on Instagram and in another post wrote: \"It's 2026 and there are still people like that. Educate yourself and your kids, please.\"\n\nChelsea said they were \"appalled and disgusted\" by the \"vile\" abuse, saying it was \"abhorrent and will not be tolerated\".\n\nIn a statement they added: \"Such behaviour is completely unacceptable and runs counter to the values of the game and everything we stand for as a club. There is no room for racism.\n\n\"We stand unequivocally with Wes. He has our full support, as do all our players who are too often forced to endure this hatred simply for doing their job. We will work with the relevant authorities and platforms in identifying the perpetrators and take the strongest possible action.\"\n\nBurnley said they were \"disgusted\" by the abuse, adding in a statement: \"The club has reported the post to Instagram's parent company, Meta, and expects strong support from them, together with the Premier League and the police, and will work to ensure that the individual responsible is identified and investigated.\n\n\"There is no place for this in our society and we condemn it unreservedly.\n\n\"The club continues to be unequivocal in its stance – we have a zero-tolerance approach to any form of discrimination.\n\n\"Hannibal will receive the full backing from the club and from the Burnley fans, who we have already seen condemning the abuse. There is no room for racism.\"\n\nThe Premier League has condemned the abuse and said \"any individuals identified and found guilty of discrimination will face the strongest possible consequences, including club bans and legal prosecution\".\n\nThey are the latest incidences of racist abuse towards players this season and come days after the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr during a Champions League match against Benfica, which Uefa is investigating.\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found that more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nIn August, the season opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth was stopped in the first half after then Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA Liverpool man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted the police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was also the target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Meta for a response.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "As Manchester City continue to crank up the pressure on Arsenal, Pep Guardiola tells his players to take three days off to \"enjoy life\" with \"caipirinhas and daiquiris\".",
    "fullText": "The sight of a beaming Pep Guardiola pumping his fists to all sides of Etihad Stadium then telling his players to indulge in cocktails demonstrated the magnitude of this Manchester City victory.\n\nOn a night of nerves and tension, City overcame Newcastle United to secure a 2-1 win that sent a loud and ominous message: \"Over to you, Arsenal.\"\n\nGuardiola was so satisfied with the win that he announced his players could have three days off, telling them to \"enjoy life\" with \"caipirinhas and daiquiris\".\n\nWhether they take his advice literally remains to be seen, but the celebrations were significant in the afterglow of victory.\n\nCity's win leaves them only two points behind the Gunners, who showed signs of creaking under pressure as they cast aside a two-goal lead to draw with relegation certainties Wolverhampton Wanderers in midweek.\n\nAnd Guardiola's animated, emotional reaction at the final whistle on Saturday was mirrored around the stadium on a night when he said: \"The connection we had with our fans was the best of the season. We had the best vibes and we need those vibes between now and the end of the season.\n\n\"It wasn't the ideal game, but we were a team and this is what we have to do at this stage of the season.\"\n\nThis may not be the same City side, when it comes to personnel, that made a habit of stringing together unstoppable sequences of results to break the hearts of Liverpool and Arsenal in title races of the past.\n\nCity still, however, have the manager and winner in Guardiola who knows how to navigate the course and distance – and this win has cranked up the pressure on Arsenal ahead of the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday.\n\nHe believes 70% of his current squad have not been down this title road, but there are still plenty who have, such as Ruben Dias and Rodri to name two, and most importantly Guardiola himself.\n\nMikel Arteta's Arsenal must now respond against their arch-rivals, who will have new interim manager Igor Tudor in the dug-out.\n\nThis may not be the fluent City of recent past, but they showed steel to dig deep as Newcastle made light of their 5,000-mile round trip to Azerbaijan to face Qarabag in the Champions League play-off, pushing them all the way.\n\nLeading by example was the giant figure of Erling Haaland, not by dealing in his usual currency of goals, but with lung-busting work-rate, intense pressing, towering defensive headers, and a perfect cross for what turned out to be the winner from Nico O'Reilly as he headed in the second of his two goals.\n\nGuardiola acknowledged Haaland's contribution as he said: \"He was man of the match. Without Erling it would not have been possible.\"\n\nO'Reilly was another stellar contributor, with those two goals and an outstanding display of versatility playing behind City's attackers that will make intriguing viewing for England head coach Thomas Tuchel.\n\nHe is viewed as a left-back, but this showed he has other strings to his bow, while Newcastle United's Lewis Hall also got on the scoresheet and showed enough to suggest he is another viable defensive World Cup option for Tuchel.\n\nCity may not have the machine-like fluency and relentless winning style of the Guardiola teams that won four straight Premier League titles, but those memories can still kick in for plenty who will play their part in coming weeks.\n\nOne of the newer faces is giant Italian keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, a Champions League winner with Paris St-Germain last season, who is now chasing new honours and horizons with Manchester City.\n\nIn some respects he is a flawed keeper, especially under crosses, but has that uncanny, priceless habit of making stunning match-winning saves that makes up for other failings.\n\nHe did it with an astonishing stoppage time save from Alexis Mac Allister in a City win at Liverpool that may yet be regarded as the pivotal moment in their season, and he did it again here.\n\nAs the final seconds ticked on with Newcastle pressing for a point, Donnarumma employed that giant wingspan to stretch away low to his right to turn away Harvey Barnes' goal-bound shot.\n\nSeconds later, the final whistle went and Etihad Stadium was awash with celebration.\n\nTime will tell just how important those saves - those wins - will be, but City are now in a position from which they have flourished before.\n\nWin all their games. Win the Premier League.\n\nNow the scenery shifts to north London - along with the pressure - as Arsenal face that dangerous trip to Spurs.\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Is Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?",
    "description": "\"Everyone has to take a look at themselves\" - what went wrong for England in their record Six Nations home defeat by Ireland?",
    "fullText": "Before the Six Nations started, England head coach Steve Borthwick talked about the game against France in Paris on 14 March being a possible title decider.\n\n\"We want to be in a position in that game to get what we all want to achieve. We want English fans flooding across the channel to get there and watch that game,\" he said.\n\nA repeat of the 2016 Grand Slam in Paris and a first title since 2020 was the goal.\n\nInstead, two heavy back-to-back defeats have left England in fourth place in the standings and out of the title race, with just one win against Wales to show for their efforts.\n\nEngland's 12-game winning streak went up in smoke with a 31-20 loss to Scotland at Murrayfield last week, before their nine-match winning home run was emphatically ended with Saturday's equally dismal 42-21 defeat by Ireland.\n\nThe manner of those defeats raises questions about Borthwick's tactics and his team's mentality.\n\nThey also leave England needing to pick up points from away games against Italy and France to even finish mid-table.\n\nIt was a nightmare performance at Allianz Stadium, with five tries conceded in one of the worst performances of Borthwick's tenure.\n\n\"Two weeks ago after 12 wins on the bounce people were saying we were the best team in the world, and now we are all sorts of things. Neither of these are true,\" Borthwick told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We are on a journey of development that has a lot of growth in it. That England team from today will be a lot better in two weeks' time.\"\n\nIreland scored 22 points inside the first 30 minutes - the fourth-most first-half points conceded by England at home.\n\nThat followed England going 17-0 down in 15 minutes against Scotland at Murrayfield.\n\n\"Fast starts are not about being physical and smashing them, that is a given, you are running out for your country,\" former England scrum-half Matt Dawson told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"It's the tactics. It's about how you are going to play, where you will play and how they will play.\n\n\"It's individual preparation and the understanding of how to play professional sport, not just rugby. Have you got that mentality to adapt from minute one?\n\n\"England, when it goes badly in the first 10 minutes, they are yet to find a methodology or a way out of it.\"\n\nFormer England fly-half Paul Grayson added: \"From nowhere England pulled out a performance that lacked accuracy, energy and emotion.\n\n\"The Twickenham crowd were making a heck of a racket at the start but 30 minutes in there were ironic cheers for making touch with a kick.\"\n\nBorthwick has been here before as England boss. In 2023 his side shipped 53 points at home to France but later that year they were minutes away from making a World Cup final.\n\n\"England had a chance against Ireland to show the Murrayfield nightmare was just a blip, but instead things were even worse, with the defence porous, accuracy non-existent, and the gameplan exposed,\" said BBC rugby correspondent Chris Jones.\n\n\"All the momentum and confidence generated from that 12-month winning run has evaporated in the space of 160 minutes of rugby.\n\n\"England's tactics have been picked apart by Scotland and Ireland, and Borthwick will need to react and adapt if they are to salvage their campaign in Rome and Paris.\"\n\nAfter seven dynamic caps off the bench, 21-year-old back rower Henry Pollock finally gained a first Test start.\n\nThe idea was his energy would help avoid a repeat of last week when Scotland blitzed England in the opening 20 minutes.\n\n\"What do you do? Two weeks in a row conceding so many points in the first 15 minutes,\" prop forward Ellis Genge told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Everyone has to take a look at themselves. No-one knows what the answer is right now or we would have sorted it out.\n\n\"It opened up scar tissue from last week - we have to be better at managing that period and stop turning the ball over.\n\n\"It's brutal, professional sport because if you get 5% wrong it's gone. We probably believed the hype from the first week too much. We can't let the noise in now.\n\n\"We have let everyone down. Apologies for that but I promise we will make it better. We are going to go away and work as hard as we can to go away and rectify things.\"\n\nEngland found themselves deep in Ireland's 22 on multiple occasions but lacked any clinical edge, making 14 handling errors in the game.\n\nGeorge Ford also missed touch with a penalty that could have put the hosts in a scoring position.\n\n\"As players, senior players and the leadership team we have to take responsibility for not starting the game right,\" said Itoje.\n\n\"It was just our inaccuracy. We turned the ball over too much, and when we did get into positions to hurt Ireland we were not accurate and then gave ourselves a mountain to climb.\"\n\nAn England blip, or long-term cause for concern?\n\nEngland v Ireland as it happened plus match reaction\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\nIreland took advantage of England's poor one-on-one tackling to make 12 line breaks.\n\nStuart McCloskey's clean break leading to Ireland's second try came after replacement Jack van Poortvliet, who had not long arrived on the field in place of the injured Alex Mitchell, overshot the read, with Ollie Lawrence then fended off.\n\nFraser Dingwall was beaten on the outside by Robert Baloucoune, who dummied Tommy Freeman and then escaped Lawrence, for the third score.\n\nIreland captain Caelan Doris then broke through Genge to sprint clear and help set up Dan Sheehan's bonus-point try early in the second half.\n\n\"In the first 30 minutes of a Test match collisions should be massive, but England were not even making contact and were getting rinsed down the middle of the field two or three times,\" added Grayson.\n\n\"England were utterly dreadful in defence.\"\n\nBaloucoune and Sheehan's tries both resulted in yellow cards from scrambling defence by Freddie Steward and Pollock, which further added to England's problems.\n\nEngland's kick-heavy strategy was key in their 12-game winning run, but against Scotland they failed to win the aerial battle.\n\nFreeman's switch back from outside centre to the right wing was with the view of improving in that area.\n\nThe 24-year-old had a mixed day in the air against Ireland, but still managed to compete when called upon.\n\nGiven Ireland lost James Lowe early to injury, utilising Freeman against O'Brien early on could have brought some change.\n\nInstead, Leinster's O'Brien managed to regather a kick that eventually led to Baloucoune's try.\n\nIreland simply won the aerial battle, also taking advantage of the height difference between the 6ft 4in Baloucoune and Henry Arundell, who is four inches shorter.\n\nArundell, 23, was backed to respond from his red card against Scotland and failed to enforce himself.\n\nImmanuel Feyi-Waboso's championship-ending injury is proving a vital moment in England's campaign.\n\nWhat was once their biggest strength is now becoming a weakness.\n\nEngland 6-42 South Africa, 2008",

    "description": "Scotland displayed a different side of their personality in the dramatic comeback victory over Wales in Cardiff, writes Tom English.",
    "fullText": "Amid the maelstrom of the closing minutes in Cardiff there was a slightly comedic moment. As the upset to end all upsets loomed large, Scotland pounded hard at the Welsh line, their desperation in full flow, the home defiance bordering on the heroic.\n\nInside the Principality, the noise was deafening, The head thudded, the ears split. Wales in crisis? Nobody seemed to tell Dewi Lake or Rhys Carre or their locks and back-rows and midfielders, who were awesome.\n\nCrisis, yes. But for Scotland. Wales were not looking like a team that had lost 23 out of their previous 25 games, who had come into this as no-hopers with the bookmakers. They were tired men, though. They were flagging with the finishing line in sight.\n\nThis was such a familiar nightmare for the Scots, their darkest fears in play, their rugby sanity at stake. Wales led 23-19. They had outgunned Scotland, routing them at the breakdown, stifling their lethal runners, battering them in the collisions.\n\nBut Scotland were fighting back, they were beginning to rise above their own shortcomings. In that moment, as Scotland rumbled off a close-range lineout, the giant screens flashed a message for the Welsh fans: \"Get louder,\" it demanded.\n\nLouder? You cannot be serious. The temptation was to laugh because the place couldn't have been any more electrified, but the drama down below didn't allow for mirth. It was wonderfully tense, a game of psychology as much as a game of rugby.\n\nScotland show 'bottle' & 'grit' in 'ugly' Cardiff win\n\nPodcast: Reaction to Scotland's dramatic Cardiff comeback\n\nScotland battle back for Six Nations win over Wales\n\nSeconds later, George Turner piled over and, at last, Scotland were ahead for the first time in their stressful day. Finn Russell made it a three-point game with the boot and the visitors saw it out from there.\n\nThey looked exhausted and relieved on full-time, like they'd had a brush with ghosts rather than dragons. Sione Tuipulotu said they had to dig deep and that was true.\n\nThey dug and dug and dug. It was error-strewn and maddening at times but they kept at it. If they only rarely managed to show their class, they displayed character when the heat was at its most intense. Cool heads amid the desperation won the day.\n\nWinning ugly is a concept that has seemed beyond Scotland for years. For the most part, at any rate. They normally win with a flourish or not at all. This was an ugly one, but magnificent at the same time.\n\nThey were asked all sorts of questions and came up with enough answers. It was seriously flawed but that made the manner of the win all the more laudable. They were losing 20-5 after 47 minutes and won the remainder of it 21-3 even though never coming close to playing their best stuff. How can you not salute that spirit?\n\nLast week we saw them win with panache, this week we saw them win through belligerence and character. Two different styles but the same precious five points.\n\nAfter the torment of defeat in week one, Scotland are top of the table. They'll drop to second if France beat Italy on Sunday, but second after three games is rarefied air for Gregor Townsend and his team.\n\nWales? Brilliant but beaten, losers on the day but with so much to build on - and a little bit to complain about, too. If that Turner try ended up being the decisive moment in the game there was another moment, on 64 minutes, that could have filled that slot.\n\nWales were ahead 23-19 at the time. Into the Scotland 22 they went and won a penalty. They could have backheeled it over, had it stood, which it didn't. The TMO got involved and a call was made against Tomos Williams for a croc roll on Rory Darge that didn't look like a croc roll.\n\nPenalty reversed. A shot for 26-19 gone. Turner drove over soon after and that was that. Back from the cliff edge Scotland stepped and into the coming weeks they go with France to play at home and Ireland away.\n\nA formidable finale to their tournament, but at least they're alive and not without hope of achieving something tangible. Whatever happens against France they will be playing for a Triple Crown in Dublin. They haven't won it since 1990.\n\nWhat is it about this fixture that produces such hair-raisers? What is it about those Scotland jerseys that makes the Welsh believe in themselves?\n\nFrom the get-go, they were terrific. Scotland forced things and got found out. They tried to go wide at every turn, but got smashed. Even when Joe Hawkins was binned after five minutes Wales grew stronger. Carre scored while they were down to 14. Those awful Welsh starts in so many recent Test matches? Forget it.\n\nScotland coughed up chances, then scored one, then conceded another. They had little composure and no control. Wales would not allow it. Sam Costelow made it 17-5 after half an hour. Red flags all over the place now.\n\nTownsend didn't hang about. Thirty-five minutes played and he hauled off Nathan McBeth, his loosehead, and Max Williamson, one of his locks. Fortunes did not change, not immediately. Scotland's looseness carried on. So did the Welsh scoring; 20-5 now.\n\nFatalism kicks in at that point. Here we go again. Another Cardiff catastrophe. Jungle drums beating. Townsend must go. Everybody must go.\n\nHuw Jones, one of the most formidable attackers in the history of the Scotland team, dropped a ball with the try-line close at hand. When the likes of Jones are making a mess of things you start to fear the worst. You crank up the obits.\n\nInstead of an implosion we saw Scotland reversing the narrative. Russell darted over to make it 20-12. Jarrod Evans stretched it to 23-12, but what happened next was remarkable.\n\nRussell restarted. He spotted space and dropped his kick into the no-man's land Wales offered him, Darcy Graham reading his mind and speeding on to it. As James Botham slept, his back turned to the play, Graham pounced.\n\nA kindly bounce and he was in for a blink-and-you-miss-it score. A colossal Welsh failing to some eyes, a piece of Russell genius to others.\n\nThe tension - raw and exhilarating - continued. The Williams croc roll and the siege lifted on the back of it. The sense of impending Welsh doom only for the Scots to lose ball on the floor just as they threatened to motor. The Turner try and the Scotland scrum penalty at the end. They cleared the lines and escaped to victory.\n\nLater, Pierre Schoeman suggested it was a bigger win than last week's victory over England. You can see where he was coming from. The rugby world knows Scotland can beat England, but not many folk knew they could come from so many points down in an unforgiving place to win a battle.\n\nThey showed a different side of their personality on Saturday, a terrible beauty on an extraordinary day.",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat's rink were unable to end a 102-year wait for a men's Winter Olympic curling gold - and vanquish their own disappointment from 2022 - as Canada denied Team GB a fourth gold medal of this year's Games.\n\nMouat, Grant Hardie, Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie - plus alternate Kyle Waddell - arrived in Cortina as world champions and favourites.\n\nThey arrived believing this was their time. But they will leave as silver medallists for the second successive Olympics.\n\nLeft bereft by defeat against Sweden in the final in Beijing four years ago, the Scottish quartet have come to dominate their sport since.\n\nThe past 10 days in Italy have not been straightforward, though.\n\nThey were on the brink of a shock early exit as recently as Thursday and, while they recovered to guarantee a medal, they did not get the one they really wanted as they lost 9-6. It was the second time the Canadians had beaten them in five days.\n\n\"I'm a bit in shock. I think we felt like we were the better team. I don't know what to say,\" a tear-choked Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nWhat do curlers do when they're not at the Olympics?\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nAfter the epic semi-final win over Switzerland on Thursday, Mouat referred to it as \"our gold medal\". Presumptuous? Perhaps. But that belief was founded in fact.\n\nHis rink have won two World Championships and a couple of European crowns as well as a record 12 Grand Slam titles since the last Games.\n\nFurthermore, they boast an excellent record against the Canadians and beat them in last year's world semis. Jacobs' time-served team did win the round-robin meeting earlier in the week but that was a rare reverse.\n\nIn that contest, GB led after six ends before slipping to the 9-5 defeat that left them needing favours from other teams.\n\nIt was the same this time, a fabulous Mouat double-takeout edging GB 5-4 ahead at that stage after a cagey opening half during which he and 2014 gold-medallist Brad Jacobs traded points.\n\nCanada - who have had a tumultuous time of it themselves here amid cheating claims - drew level after seven, but Britain had the advantage of the hammer in two of the final three ends.\n\nThey could not make the most of that though.\n\nJust one in the eighth for GB gave Canada the sniff of an opportunity and that snatched it ruthlessly, capitalising on some slack stones in the ninth to lead 8-6 going into the last.\n\nMouat had the hammer but he needed two to force an extra end. Could the man considered the best shot-maker in world come up with the goods in the biggest moment?\n\nHe couldn't. And for the second Olympics in a row, the GB rink were left with a medal that they did not want.\n\n\"We wanted to win it for each other,\" an emotional Hardie told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The pain from four years ago was so much that we wanted to give it another go. We gave ourselves a chance but unfortunately we've not got there again.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

We cover that near the bottom of this page.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% offers nearly double: Mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nDiscover 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rates.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nWant to refinance your mortgage in 2026? Here's what to do.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You also have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues, if applicable. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped with those of the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDig deeper into 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to get an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nFirst of all, now is a good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\n\nMortgage rates have also dropped since this time last year.\n\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\n\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.86% right now. Why are Zillow's rates usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac (which reported 6.01% this week) and elsewhere? Each source compiles rates by different methods. Zillow obtains rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. However, mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code, by lender, loan type, and many other factors. That's why it's so important to shop with multiple mortgage lenders.\n\nAre interest rates expected to go down?\n\nNot much. According to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.1% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nOverall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually since the end of May last year. The 30-year fixed rate topped out over 7% in January 2025, then bounced higher and lower for months. On May 29 2025, the 30-year rate was 6.89%, and began slowly moving down.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score. Learn how to lower your refi costs, both at closing and long term.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Here's what you should know if you want to refinance your mortgage loan in early 2026.",

    "fullText": "If you own a GMC truck in Houston, this story may hit close to home.\n\nA River Oaks resident says he did everything right. His truck was parked in his driveway. The area was well-lit. A surveillance camera with a spotlight pointed directly at the vehicle. It was not tucked away in a dark corner of the street. It was sitting right outside his home, in plain view.\n\nAccording to a report aired by FOX 26 Houston, the theft happened around 3:30 a.m. The owner had no idea until hours later. He woke up Friday morning around 6:30 and began getting ready for work. At about 8 a.m., he walked into the driveway, just like he does every day. He pressed the unlock button on his key fob and looked up.\n\n“I was honestly just in complete shock,” he told reporter Jillian Hartmann.\n\nEvery car is special, but this one is particularly special to its owner. He described it as his first major purchase. Something he worked hard for. Something he had paid off. In a matter of minutes, it was taken.\n\nThe brazen nature of the theft makes this case especially unsettling. The homeowner says he has a driveway camera aimed directly at where the truck was parked. After realizing the vehicle was missing, he checked the footage on his phone.\n\nSure enough, the recording showed the theft unfolding in the early morning hours.\n\nThe suspects appeared unfazed by the cameras. The driveway was fully illuminated. A spotlight from the camera lit up the scene. Yet the thieves carried on without hesitation. The victim believes they were professionals. He said the theft took very little time.\n\nEven more concerning is the apparent targeting.\n\nThe homeowner noted there are more than 100 vehicles parked along his street overnight. Despite that, the suspects specifically chose his GMC truck. It was not hidden. It was not isolated. It was not easier to access compared to other cars parked on the street. And still, it was the one they took.\n\nThe victim later saw a previous FOX 26 report detailing a rise in GMC truck thefts across the Houston area. That is when it clicked.\n\n“I had no idea I had a sitting duck in my driveway,” he said.\n\nHis shock didn’t come from just losing the truck. It was more about how easy the operation looked. He acknowledged that car theft is common in Houston, but like many owners, he never expected it to happen to him.\n\nThere is a particular sting to walking outside and seeing an empty parking space where your vehicle once sat. No broken glass. No loud alarm woke the neighborhood. Just silence and an empty driveway. It hits the kind of different that only people unfortunate enough to have experienced it can truly understand.\n\nThe resident says he is speaking out to raise awareness within the GMC truck community. His warning is simple. If you own one, pay attention. Extra lighting and visible cameras may not be enough deterrent.\n\nHouston police are investigating the case. Authorities are urging anyone with information to contact HPD.\n\nFor truck owners, this incident underscores a growing concern. High-demand vehicles often become high-priority targets.\n\nAnd targeting comes in different shades.\n\nWe recently ran the story of a North Georgia dealership salesman who allegedly targeted and sold a $90k pickup to an elderly man with dementia. He even traveled 40 miles to the man’s home and then drove him back to the dealership to close the deal.\n\nProfessional theft crews can move quickly, sometimes in under a minute, using increasingly sophisticated methods. In many cases, by the time the owner realizes something is wrong, the vehicle is already far from the neighborhood where it was parked.\n\nFor this River Oaks resident, the experience has been a harsh wake-up call. What felt secure one night turned out to be anything but. And for GMC owners across Houston, his story is a reminder that convenience and familiarity can sometimes create a false sense of safety.\n\nThe driveway may feel like the safest place to park. In this case, it was not.\n\nEditorial Note: Video playback may be limited on some platforms.

    "fullText": "Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are dealing with a lawsuit tied to the name of their Kansas City restaurant, 1587 Prime.\n\nA sneaker brand has filed a trademark infringement claim against the Chiefs teammates and their restaurant partners, asserting that the use of “1587” conflicts with its own branding.\n\nAt the center of the dispute is the shared number combination used by both businesses. The legal battle now hinges on whether the two brands can operate under similar marks in different industries.\n\nThe complaint was brought by 1587 Sneakers, which says it began selling footwear under that name on April 13, 2023.\n\nThe restaurant’s title merges Mahomes’ No. 15 and Kelce’s No. 87, a pairing the sneaker company argues it had already established in commerce.\n\nCourt records show that 1587 Prime applied for its trademark in December 2023 in the restaurant category, while 1587 Sneakers filed its application last October in the clothing category.\n\nThe sneaker brand claims that “scores of consumers” have reached out believing the two ventures are connected.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to bar the restaurant group from continuing to use the 1587 branding, halt the sale of related merchandise, and secure unspecified damages.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark attorney not involved in the matter, indicated the sneaker company could face challenges proving infringement.\n\nHe noted that trademarks are often allowed to coexist across separate business sectors unless consumer confusion is clearly shown.\n\n“I think it’s a tough case for the sneaker company,” Gerben said. “Trademarks can coexist in different industries. … Given that the marks are essentially identical here, is a restaurant and a shoe company too close? Are consumers likely to be confused in thinking they are affiliated with one another?”\n\nA publicist for Kelce declined to comment, and a representative for Mahomes did not respond to inquiries.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell are fighting the requested release of 90,000 pages related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, saying a law used to force the public release of millions of documents is unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawyers filed papers late Friday in Manhattan federal court to try to block the release of documents from a since-settled civil defamation lawsuit brought a decade ago by the late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell. The Justice Department recently asked a judge to lift secrecy requirements on the files.\n\nMaxwell's attorneys said the Justice Department obtained the documents — otherwise subject to secrecy orders — improperly during its criminal probe of Maxwell. They said the documents include transcripts of over 30 depositions and private information regarding financial and sexual matters related to Maxwell and others.\n\nSome records from the year-long exchange of evidence in the lawsuit battle were already released publicly in response to a federal appeals court order.\n\nMaxwell’s lawyers say a law Congress passed in December to force the release of millions of Epstein-related documents violates the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.\n\n“Congress cannot, by statute, strip this Court of the power or relieve it of the responsibility to protect its files from misuse. To do so violates the separation of powers,” wrote the lawyers, Laura Menninger and Jeffrey Pagliuca about the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\n“Under the Constitution’s separation of powers, neither Congress nor the Executive Branch may intrude on the judicial power. That power includes the power to definitively and finally resolve cases and disputes,” the lawyers added.\n\nThe release of Epstein-related documents from criminal probes that began weeks ago has resulted in new revelations about Epstein's decades-long sexual abuse of women and teenage girls. Some victims have complained that their names and personal information were revealed in documents while the names of their abusers were blacked out.\n\nMembers of Congress have complained that only about half of existing documents, many with redactions, have been made public even as Justice Department officials have said everything has been released, except for some files that can't be made public until a judge gives the go-ahead.\n\nGiuffre said Epstein had trafficked her to other men, including the former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. She sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17.\n\nHe denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022. Days ago, he was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours on suspicion of misconduct in having shared confidential trade information with Epstein.\n\nIn a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn’t include her in the sex trafficking prosecution of Maxwell because they didn’t want her allegations to distract the jury.\n\nMaxwell, 64, was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein took his own life in a federal lockup in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\n\nTwo weeks ago, she declined to answer questions from House Oversight Committee lawmakers in a deposition conducted in a a video call to her federal prison camp, though she indicated through a statement from her lawyer that she was “prepared to speak fully and honestly” if granted clemency.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.",
