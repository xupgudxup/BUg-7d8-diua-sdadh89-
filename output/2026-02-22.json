    "fullText": "The Milwaukee Bucks return to Fiserv Forum for the first time since Feb. 6 when they host the Toronto Raptors in a matinee this afternoon. The game is the start of a four-game homestand through Feb. 27, and a stretch of nine home games through March 10.\n\nThe Bucks (24-30) will try to win a fourth straight game for the first time this season.\n\nThey have won six of their last seven games and three in a row, which has matched their previous season-long win streak.

    "title": "New UFC Heavyweight Rankings: Spivac Returns to Top 10 After UFC Fight Night Houston Win",
    "description": "On Saturday night, the MMA world leader returned to Paramount+ with a new UFC Fight Night card in Houston, TX. […]",
    "fullText": "On Saturday night, the MMA world leader returned to Paramount+ with a new UFC Fight Night card in Houston, TX. On the event’s main card, top 15 heavyweights Serghei Spivac and Ante Delija went toe-to-toe, looking to move up in the UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSpivac ended up getting the decision win after a violent and back-and-forth war. Let’s look at how his victory changed our latest UFC heavyweight rankings.\n\nSerghei Spivac has remained a consistent top-15-level fighter at heavyweight for the last five years. While he has lost six times inside the Octagon, his most recent setbacks have come to elite competition like Tom Aspinall, Waldo Cortes-Acosta, and Ciryl Gane. However, he also has quite a few big wins against big-name or ranked foes.\n\nHe scored another in February when he earned a very hard-fought win over talented finisher Ante Delija. His latest win stopped a potential losing skid and got him back in our top 10.\n\nFormer Brave CF star Shamil Gaziev has put together a notable run in the division. Although a doctor stoppage in 2024 gave him his first loss, the Dagestani big man is 3-1 in the Octagon, including two nasty knockouts. Gaziev is a rising heavyweight fighter to keep an eye on. However, he took a big risk in November when he okay’d a short-notice fight with Waldo Cortes Acosta. The decision backfired, and he suffered a stinging knockout loss.\n\nPFL and Contender Series veteran Rizvan Kuniev lands in our UFC heavyweight rankings after he scored the biggest win of his career with a hard-fought victory over Jailton Almeida in February. While it wasn’t pretty, he proved he can compete with top-10 talent. He will need a definitive W in his next fight if he wants to hold on to a spot in our latest rankings.\n\nMarcin Tubura has quietly been a mainstay of the UFC heavyweight rankings over the last half-decade. While he owns a 14-8 record in the company, he has grown immensely as a fighter in the last few years. He is 10-3 in his last 12, with his only losses coming to elite talents Alexander Volkov, Serghei Spivac, and current interim heavyweight king Tom Aspinall.\n\nIn March, he picked up a hard-fought win over Aspinall’s trainer partner and one of the better rising prospects in the division, Mick Parkin.\n\nSergei Pavlovich has been an absolute crushing machine during much of his UFC career. After a loss to Alistair Overeem in his debut, he reeled off six straight wins, and all of those victories came by way of a devastating knockout. However, a two-fight losing streak stopped all of his momentum. But he has righted the ship in 2025 and scored a pair of decision wins. The most recent was against Waldo Cortes-Acosta in Shanghai.\n\nDominican big man Waldo Cortes Acosta has quietly become a serious force in the heavyweight division. In his 12 bouts inside the Octagon, he has posted 10 wins, including against some notable talents in the top 15. The latest came in January at UFC 324 against fan-favorite Derrick Lewis.\n\n“Salsa Boy” showed why he is one of the more athletic and polished strikers in the division when he added a two-time challenger to his hit list inside the Octagon.\n\nWhile there have been some very tough losses in the career of Curtis Blaydes, he has remained a top-five level heavyweight for much of the last decade. At UFC 299, he had an opportunity to finally right his big-fight wrongs and did so in a major way when he handed Jailton Almeida his first loss in the Octagon.\n\nThe win moved “Razor” into a UFC 304 title fight against Tom Aspinall. Unfortunately, his big fight curse returned, and after a strong start suffered a TKO loss in Round 1. At UFC Baku, the talented wrestler returned and was able to grind out a hard-fought win over Rizvan Kuniev. But the victory did little to get him back into title contention.\n\nAlexander Volkov has been a top-level MMA heavyweight for a long time. While he has been unable to earn a UFC title shot, he has remained a stalwart of the top 10 for years. To many who watched UFC 310, he scored a victory against Ciryl Gane that should have earned him a title. However, the judges did not score it his way, and he suffered a crushing defeat to the Frenchman.\n\nIn October, he bounced back from the setback to get himself right back into title contention by scoring a very hard-fought split-decision win over top-five talent Jailton Almeida.\n\nCiryl Gane is a fantastic athlete and the most technical heavyweight striker in the sport. It is why he is consistently in the title discussion. However, his wrestling deficiencies continue to be a problem, and they showed up again in his UFC 310 clash with Alexander Volkov. Fortunately for “Bon Gamin,” he was able to escape with a decision win.\n\nThe victory earned him a title opportunity at UFC 321. However, the good luck he had against Volkov turned to bad, and his chance at winning UFC gold again was stopped after just a few minutes when he poked champ Tom Aspinall in both eyes and caused a fight-ending no-contest.\n\nEnglishman Tom Aspinall is the best heavyweight in the UFC. That became official when MMA GOAT Jon Jones decided to walk away from the sport earlier this year. The Englishman has beaten many of the best fighters in the division for the last three years and is the undisputed top big man in the eyes of most UFC fans.\n\nAfter definitively avenging the lone loss of his UFC career in the summer of 2024, he made his first defense of the undisputed title in October. Unfortunately, a nasty eye poke from opponent Ciryl Game ended the UFC 321 main event after just a few minutes. An immediate rematch early in 2026 seems likely.\n\nNew UFC Middleweight Rankings: Is Strickland vs. Chimaev Next After UFC Houston?\n\nComplete UFC Fight Night Results & Highlights: Sean Strickland Dominates In Bounce Back Win\n\nRonda Rousey Explains Why TKO Being Cheap Killed Plans For Return Fight in UFC",

    "fullText": "Despite the result, Wolves manager Rob Edwards should be happier with his side's performance as they were the more competitive side before Ladislav Krejci's red card on 61 minutes - and frustrated Crystal Palace after it.\n\nWhile Palace had marginally more possession in the first half, Wolves spent more time in the home side's final third, with Mateus Mane and Andre providing a spark in midfield.\n\nThey had more efforts on goal too, and it felt like a goal was coming when they earned their penalty on 41 minutes.\n\nYerson Mosquera intercepted a Palace pass in their own half and although he was fouled, referee Thomas Kirk did well to wave play on and moments later Mane was brought down in the box by Adam Wharton.\n\nTolu Arokodare's side-footed spot-kick was easy for Henderson to save low to his left, though, and was the Nigeria striker's fifth straight penalty miss, a run stretching back to September 2022.\n\nThe visitors' five shots on target in the opening 45 minutes are the most they have registered in the first half of a Premier League game since last April.\n\nIt was only Krejci's dismissal that forced them onto the defensive for most of the second half, and they actually had the home side hanging on during the nine minutes of stoppage time.\n\nPalace's late winner prevented Wolves reaching 11 points, which would have put them level with Derby's record for the fewest points in a Premier League season, but after avoiding defeat in their previous three games, it is surely just a matter of time before Edwards' side avoid that ignominy.",

    "description": "The Cardinals get help on the EDGE, at tackle and at cornerback. They miss out on QB Ty Simpson.",
    "fullText": "It is another mock draft weekend. Every weekend until the actual 2026 NFL draft, we will run simulations for the Arizona Cardinals. Because compensatory picks have not been announced yet, exact Day 3 picks are still uncertain, so this mock draft simulation is only three rounds.\n\nIn this mock draft, using Pro Football Network's simulator, the idea was to try and make it match with what NFL.com draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah said about the Cardinals. They could be in the mix for an edge rusher, and quarterback Ty Simpson would make sense in the second round.\n\nThe Simpson pick didn't happen, though.\n\nHere are the results of the three-round mock draft.\n\nThe Cardinals have not drafted a player outside the Big Ten or SEC in the first two rounds of the draft in three drafts under general manager Monti Ossenfort. Bailey can be the exception. OhiO State's Arvell Reese is on the board, and he woudl fit the profile, but Bailey is a standard, true edge rusher, and the Cardinals simply need help there. Josh Sweat had 12 sacks, and no one else made any sort of impact, and Sweat made no impact on any fourth quarter.\n\nBailey will make Sweat better, and Sweat's presence will be great for Bailey.\n\nWe go back to the SEC. The Cardinals need a right tackle, and Proctor is a monster at 6-6, 369 pounds.\n\nHe fills that void in a large way.\n\nWhy couldn't it be Alabama QB Ty Simpson? He was drafted 15th in this simulation.\n\nAnother cornerback? Well, yes, because the Cardinals' corners can't stay healthy. Neal would pair nicely with Will Johnson with both of their size. Johnson is 6-2. So is Neal.\n\nSo the Cardinals add defensive help and get a bookend tackle. That's not a bad result.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Johnny Gaudreau's No. 13 jersey was hanging in the U.S. locker room throughout the Olympics, and Dylan Larkin and Matthew Tkachuk carried it around the ice after the U.S. beat Canada in overtime to win the country's first gold medal at the Games since 1980.\n\nThen, the tribute to the late player known as “Johnny Hockey” went even further.\n\nThe oldest two of Johnny and Meredith Gaudreau's three children were in attendance, along with their grandparents, Guy and Jane, and they got to be part of the celebration. Larkin and Werenski brought 3-year-old Noa and 2-year-old Johnny Jr. on the ice for the team photo, which also had Gaudreau's jersey in it. To a man, players said he should have been with them.\n\n“It meant everything,\" said Werenski, who assisted on Jack Hughes' golden goal in overtime. \"This is something John would have been at. And to see his family here supporting us and seeing his kids, bringing them on the ice, we talked about playing for him, making him proud and I think we did that. Super special to see them and to have kids on the ice, he was a huge part of USA Hockey.”\n\nJohnny and his brother, Matthew, died in August 2024 when they were struck by an SUV while riding bicycles near their hometown in New Jersey on the eve of their sister Katie’s wedding.\n\n“He’s with us here in spirit for the whole tournament,\" captain Auston Matthews said. “To have his jersey out there in the team photo and have his kids come out and be with us, we’re obviously thinking of him.”\n\nAn elite player a decade into his NHL career and the all-time U.S. leading scorer in international play, Johnny Gaudreau was on track to be in Milan. Guy Gaudreau said USA Hockey told the family that their oldest son was on the projected roster.\n\n“He obviously would have been on this team — and been a huge part of it,” forward J.T. Miller said. “A guy I grew up with and against and knew pretty well. It’s more than hockey, at that point. ... He deserved better, and he had a big part in how things went down today.”\n\nLarkin, who was also clsoe to Gaudreau, dedicated what is just the third U.S. men's hockey gold in history to Gaudreau and former USA Hockey executive Jim Johannson, who died unexpectedly just before the 2018 Olympics.\n\n“This is for the guys who wore this jersey before us,” Larkin said. \"All those people should be here. Johnny especially, Matty his brother. To get it done today, it’s just an unbelievable feeling.’’\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest manager Vitor Pereira admitted he was “angry with football” after his side conceded a stoppage-time winner against Liverpool, but insisted he remains confident Forest can win their fight for survival.\n\nA 98th-minute goal from Alexis Mac Allister leaves Forest 17th in the table, just two points above West Ham United, who have lost only one of their last five matches.\n\n“I’m frustrated. Frustrated inside. Angry with football,” Pereira admitted.\n\n“But, it’s time to keep the mentality to come back stronger and with confidence to face the future because, you know, the first half we played in the way that we played in Istanbul, but we didn’t score the goals. We didn’t score the chance that we created. We created two good chances to score, but we didn’t.”\n\nAsked whether there were any positives to take from the performance, the former Wolves manager found it hard to reflect positively.\n\n“No, it’s very difficult,” he admitted.\n\n“I’m very frustrated today and it’s very difficult to go inside the dressing room. What can I say to them?\n\n“They try everything to win the game, even after we conceded the first goal, we had the chance to score firstly, because we had the chance to shoot outside and try, because we want to win the game, we want to win the game.\n\n“In the end it was not one point, it was zero and this is difficult, but this is football. Football is not… we don’t have time to complain about the end, we need to, about this game, we need to put our focus on the next game.”\n\nForest now turn their attention to the Europa League, where they hold a three-goal advantage ahead of the second leg against Turkish giants Fenerbahçe.\n\nHowever, the priority remains the league, with a crucial trip to Brighton next weekend.\n\nDespite his frustration, Pereira insists he believes his squad has enough quality to stay up.\n\n“Of course, of course, [I am] very confident, very confident,” he said.\n\n“I’m frustrated, but very confident because if we keep this mentality, if we keep this ambition, and the organisation, we’ll get points for sure.”",

So do I, by the way,” Cohen said, as quoted by Anthony DiComo, Mets beat writer for MLB.com.\n\nWhat do you think? Will the Dodgers run it back again?",

The game will at least be broadcast on 98 Rock (97.9 FM) in the Baltimore vicinity, or online anywhere you can access that feed. The O’s are on the road to play the Tigers in this one, lining up like this:\n\nNow this is a spring training road lineup. Four guys who figure to be regular major league players, two guys who have a reasonable path to some MLB playing time if not a guaranteed spot on the Opening Day roster, and three guys where the season has probably gone towards disaster if they get any kind of extended run on the roster.\n\nKyle Bradish is the starting pitcher, expected to be followed by these pitchers, probably not in alphabetical order by last name: Cameron Foster, Andrew Magno, Anthony Nunez, Cameron Weston, Brandon Young. Cade Povich is expected to start tomorrow, with Albert Suárez making Tuesday’s start. For the expected starting rotation, still waiting to see Chris Bassitt, Shane Baz, or Zach Eflin get on the calendar. We know they are pitching live BPs, so don’t worry.",

    "title": "Honoring Javonte Williams three-year, $24 million deal with his top 24 plays with the Cowboys",
    "description": "Javonte Williams had a great season for the Cowboys in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys have ensured their backfield remains locked and loaded by re-signing breakout running back Javonte Williams to a new three-year, $24 million contract. The agreement, which includes $16 million in guaranteed money, comes after weeks of front-office speculation regarding the impending free agent. By locking up Williams before the start of the new league year, the Cowboys avoid having to get caught up in a bidding war for the 25-year-old running back had he entered the open market.\n\nLast week, we mentioned the Cowboys should re-sign Williams to keep their rushing attack on point. Williams earned a total of $4 million with incentives last season, and we indicated that his new asking price would double. Right on cue, that’s exactly where his new contract fell.\n\nWilliams earned every penny of his new $8 million annual salary during a career-defining 2025 campaign. After joining the Cowboys on a cheap prove-it deal, he shattered expectations by recording career-highs across the board, finishing with 1,201 rushing yards, 11 rushing touchdowns, and an efficient 4.8 yards per carry. His physical style provided the perfect thunder to the Cowboys’ high-flying passing attack, as he ranked among the league’s best with 3.58 yards after contact per carry and helped Dallas finish with the NFL’s ninth-best rushing offense.\n\nThe idea of retaining Williams had been heavily debated. The team has gotten by using cheap running back resources over the past two seasons, first with Rico Dowdle in 2024, and then with Williams last year. There’s a school of thought that the Cowboys could once again try to mitigate their running game cost with a low-cost replacement.\n\nHowever, the front office thought better of it and opted to keep Williams. While paying a chunk of money for a running back may not be ideal, the Cowboys feel good that they have their guy. He checks off a lot of boxes for what head coach Brian Schottenheimer and offensive coordinator Klayton Adams look for, and he has already demonstrated he fits well in the offense.\n\nWilliams is a physical runner, turning short gains into big plays through sheer contact balance. He shows exceptional vision and patience to navigate through the proper running lanes. His agility and impressive jump-cut ability make defenders miss and create new paths for longer runs. He has a nose for the end zone, which was evident by his numerous short-yardage and goal-line successes. He’s a reliable asset in pass protection who’s always willing to throw his body into a would-be blitzer. And his resiliency last year proved that his once-concerning knee injury appears to be a thing of the past.\n\nWith Williams locked down, the Cowboys will enter the new year with a rare sense of stability at the running back position. The team can now shift its financial focus to other high-priority stars like wide receiver George Pickens. And while the Cowboys will have to shell out some cash to hang on to these gamble acquisitions from a year ago, at least they can feel good about shoring up their offensive weapons for the remaining peak years of Dak Prescott’s career.\n\nTo honor Javonte Williams' new three-year, $24 million deal with the Cowboys, here are his Top 24 plays of the 2025 season. pic.twitter.com/LRuUdarzPy\n\n— Dan Rogers (@DannyPhantom24) February 21, 2026",

United have collected four wins and a draw under his guidance, reviving hopes of a top-four finish and a return to the Champions League.\n\nEverton remain in the mix for a Conference League berth and could close the gap on United with a victory. However, they are searching for their first home league win since December, a run that has stalled momentum in the race for a top-six position.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League from 6:30 pm GMT. Subscribers can also stream via the Sky Go app.\n\nDavid Moyes has most of his squad available for the reunion with his former club. Jack Grealish, currently on loan, is sidelined following surgery and is not expected back this season. Jake O’Brien is suspended after his recent dismissal.\n\nFor United, Mason Mount is set to return to the matchday squad after recovering from a minor knock. Matthijs de Ligt remains unavailable with a back issue, while Patrick Dorgu is sidelined with a hamstring injury and is not expected to return until April.\n\nBoth teams enter the game well rested after early FA Cup exits earlier this month. Everton’s recent home struggles contrast with United’s improving momentum under Carrick.\n\nThese are fixtures United must navigate successfully to maintain control of their Champions League ambitions. Expect the visitors to edge the contest.\n\nPrediction: Manchester United to win 3-1.\n\nEverton’s Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall targets 1978/79 Andy King milestone against Man Utd\n\nMan Utd vs Everton: Michael Carrick eyes ending five-year Premier League drought\n\nAnge Postecoglou makes ‘hardest job’ admission about Manchester United",

    "description": "Alex Cora’s Red Sox lineup against the Blue Jays on Sunday could be very similar to what his Opening Day lineup looks like on May 26 in Cincinnati.",
    "fullText": "FORT MYERS, Fla. — Alex Cora’s Red Sox lineup against the Blue Jays on Sunday could be very similar to what his Opening Day lineup looks like on May 26 in Cincinnati.\n\n“Just trying to win this league (Grapefruit League) so I just felt that’s a good way to set it up,” manager Alex Cora joked at JetBlue Park on Sunday. “But yeah, it’s something I envision. And it just happened that for the first time in years what you see early is what you’re probably going to see on Opening Day.”\n\nThat means Trevor Story is a strong candidate to open the season in the second spot, following leadoff hitter Roman Anthony.\n\nStory started in the No. 2 hole in his final 10 games of the 2025 regular season. He also batted there in all three of Boston’s AL Wild Card Series games against the Yankees.\n\nAnalytics show that a team’s best hitter should bat second. Story batted .294 with a .339 on-base percentage, .497 slugging percentage and .836 OPS over his final 84 games last season. Still, for the full the season, he posted a .308 on-base percentage, tied for 111th among qualified major league hitters. His .333 slugging percentage ranked 72nd among qualified major leaguers.\n\nWhat does Cora like about Story in that spot?\n\n“What he did last year, the last three months, he was one of the best hitters in the big leagues,” Cora said. “And it’s not about earning or he deserves whatever. But the guy stole 30 bags, he drove in 90-something runs, hit 20-something homers. He was amazing hitting the ball the other way. And if that’s the case, he’s going to be surrounded by lefties, which at one point, they’re probably going to bring a lefty for Roman. He’ll face a lefty and he can cash in.”\n\nStory likes the idea of batting second.\n\n“It’s kind of where I’ve hit most of my career is two,” he said. “Last year was kind of four or five. So either way. I’m comfortable really in those spots, two, three, four, five. And I think Roman setting the table is going to be huge. And then with JD protecting me, I like that.”\n\nStory thinks the Red Sox are “a team that can win in different ways.”\n\n“An offense that can create with speed, stretch singles into doubles, put the ball in the gap, hit home runs, too,” he said. “Obviously, Willson helps us a lot with that. He hits the ball super hard. Just been one of the most consistent, good hitters since I’ve been in the big league. So pumped to add that to the mix.”\n\nRed Sox lineup: Trade addition starting at third base, Trevor Story batting second\n\nRed Sox pitcher who’s reached 104 mph discovered baseball at 16 thanks to the Red Sox\n\nSome Things I Think I Think: Roman Anthony is already the ‘Face of the Red Sox’\n\nRed Sox get first taste of drastic rule change: ‘It’s here — and we have to adjust,’ Alex Cora says\n\nRed Sox’ Payton Tolle gets a fresh start, from the beginning",

It’s pretty weird.”\n\nHowever, the British number one defended his decision and suggested it relaxes him before high-octane action on the court.\n\nHe added: “It’s a nice one. You should try it, it’s very therapeutic. Just not listening to music the whole time. Just get on some nice birds. It’s nice. It’s very weird.”\n\nDraper proved himself to be one of the finest up-and-coming stars in tennis after his performances in 2025.\n\nThe British star won his maiden Masters title and earned himself an impressive career ranking high of world number four.\n\nThe draw has been made for the Dubai Tennis Championships and Draper has been given a kind opening to his second competitive match back.\n\nDraper will play qualifier Quentin Halys in the first round, a player he has yet to lose to in their two matches.\n\nShould Draper find a way past the Frenchman, he will await the winner of Fabian Maroszan or Arthur Rinderknech.\n\nThe British number one has been drawn in the same section of the draw as Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alexander Bublik, and Andrey Rublev.\n\nDespite missing six months of action, Draper is the fourth-best-ranked player at the ATP 500 tournament.",

    "description": "Uros Medic had an important phone call with Donald Trump",
    "fullText": "Uros Medic may have cleared one major hurdle in his quest to headline a UFC event in his home country.\n\nUFC Houston proved to be a banner show for Medic, who scored a nasty first-round knockout of Geoff Neal in Saturday’s co-main event. Afterwards, Medic called for a fight with former welterweight champion Leon Edwards and for it to take place in Medic’s native Serbia.\n\nHowever, Medic admitted immigration issues have prevented him from leaving the United States and implored President Donald Trump to help clear up the situation.\n\n“I got one little problem,” Medic said. “Immigration’s been holding me up and I can’t travel just yet. So this is my plea for help. Mr. President, if you can see this, please, we’ve got to go to Belgrade, Serbia, for the UFC this summer.”\n\nAccording to Medic, his plea did not fall on deaf ears, as UFC CEO Dana White later invited him to his office to speak to Trump personally. Trump assured Medic that his immigration issues will be taken care of.\n\n“As an immigrant it’s a little hard getting things done,” Medic said. “I know how busy they are, almost everyone in the world wants to live in the United States so immigration, it is hard. They have a lot of work to do and my case has been kind of backed up and not moving, so I was just waiting and waiting and waiting and at one point, I mean, I probably could have mentioned before I’ve been five years in the UFC, five years there was no changes. I have work permit, I’m allowed to work, there was travel documents for me to travel. I never felt safe using them because there was COVID and all this bullshit. So I never used them and I didn’t travel, so at this point I was already at the end of my patience and I had to say something and I think it was a perfect opportunity to speak my mind about it. Again, not wanting to knock them down or talk anything bad about them, I know they’re all trying to do their jobs, but I have to use the position that I’m at and I had to mention it because it’s been hard not being able to travel home.\n\n“Little did I know I get back, a phone call with Dana White, I’m back in his office, and Dana’s got President Donald Trump on speakerphone and I was just standing there, I cannot believe what’s happening. He said, ‘You’re good to go wherever you please. Just give Dana the documentation information that you need’ and I’m just blown away.”\n\nIt’s unclear how much more bureaucracy Medic actually has to deal with so that he can return home and potentially help White arrange a UFC event in Serbia’s capital, but he was heartened by his conversation with the president, whose wife Melania hails from nearby Slovenia.\n\n“It was just amazing for me to tell him about the situation and how big of a fan I am of him and obviously his wife was from where I’m from,” Medic said. “Considering where I’m from, even though it’s a different country, it’s like a five-hour drive, that’s nothing for America. You can’t even get out of Texas in five hours.\n\n“I’m still processing all of it. Dana just made my dreams come true for the second time. Third time. First, was to get signed; second, was to go into the top 15; now, I just got to speak with Mr. President on the phone and he said I’m good to travel. My stuff is done, so it’s going to take a minute for me to just process this. A lot has happened in the past hour.”",

    "fullText": "Juventus aren’t the only Serie A club that is trying to acquire the services of Bournemouth centre-back Marcos Senesi, as Roma have reportedly entered the fray.\n\nThe Bianconeri will be looking to strengthen their backline next summer with one or more additions, and the Argentine appears to be at the very top of Marco Ottolini’s shortlist.\n\nThe 28-year-old is supposedly at the peak of his powers and has already garnered experience in the most competitive domestic league in the world, having joined the Premier League side in the summer of 2022.\n\nMoreover, Senesi’s contract with the Cherries will expire at the end of the season, so he’ll be available on a free transfer.\n\nThe defender’s out-of-contract status has attracted several top suitors between England and Europe, including Manchester United. Nevertheless, many sources have identified Juventus as the club that made the most concrete approach thus far.\n\nAnd yet, the Old Lady could end up missing out on the player’s services, as Roma believe they can usurp them in the race.\n\nMarcos Senesi (Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Il Corriere dello Sport (via TuttoJuve), the Giallorossi feel they would have the advantage over their Turin-based rivals if they managed to pip them in the Champions League race.\n\nQualifying for Europe’s elite club competition would give the Romans a major financial boost and increase their appeal.\n\nJuventus appeared to be on the right track to book their place in the Champions League after a mid-season revival under Luciano Spalletti.\n\nHowever, the team lost its way in February and is currently on a skid after losing four of their last five matches across all competitions.\n\nTheir latest defeat to Como didn’t only serve as a blow to their Top-Four hopes, but also invited the Lariani back in the race.\n\nInterestingly, Roma and Juventus will cross paths next weekend in a direct showdown for a Champions League spot, but the Giallorossi are currently ahead in the table.\n\nTherefore, the Bianconeri must find their winning form immediately, as failing to qualify for the Champions League will certainly impede their chances of recruiting their top summer targets.",

    "description": "George Ford took responsibility for twice missing touch as England suffered a second damaging defeat in a row",
    "fullText": "George Ford has said that England must have some “uncomfortable” conversations after their Six Nations title hopes were all but ended by a record defeat to Ireland.\n\nThe visitors secured their biggest win at Twickenham in a 42-21 thrashing that raised huge questions over an England side that had started their campaign by beating Wales to extend a 12-match winning run.\n\nTwo below-par showings have followed, though, with England comfortably second best against Ireland having been beaten in Scotland last week to leave head coach Steve Borthwick mulling changes in personnel and approach.\n\nVastly experienced fly half Ford endured another difficult day, twice missing touch with punted penalties to the corner as he squandered field position in another profligate performance from the hosts.\n\nThe Six Nations fallow week perhaps comes at a good time for a reeling England and Ford admits that the team must be “honest” about where they are at before preparing for meetings with Italy and France in the competition’s final fortnight.\n\n“You've got two options. You either beat around the bush a little bit and avoid things or you get to be properly honest and pick it to pieces,” Ford emphasised.\n\n“We're going to be part of some uncomfortable meetings and some uncomfortable reviews, which will be a positive in the end because we actually want to address things and get to the root of some of the problems and come up with some solutions.\n\n“When you have a couple of results like this, you’ve got to front it up, take it head on and make sure that we actually properly get to some proper solutions where we can grow from it.”\n\nFord admitted that his two failures to find touch were “not acceptable”, though suggested he felt the second of them had actually stayed the right side of the corner flag.\n\nThe 32-year-old playmaker was one of three centurions in Steve Borthwick’s squad with captain Maro Itoje winning his 100th cap, but that experience failed to show as England failed to heed the lessons from the Scotland defeat with a disastrous start again proving costly.\n\n“We've got to get to the bottom of it,” Ford said. “It's clearly not good enough, and clearly in the first 15-20 minutes in a Test match you want to at least give yourselves a foothold in the game.\n\n“We were far too inaccurate. I think in the game we gave 24 turnovers away in a variety of ways. From some kicking stuff, some breakdown, some set-piece. I think Ireland were pretty ruthless and clinical when they had opportunities in the first 15, 20 minutes.\n\n“We didn't stem that quick enough, it got away from us a little bit when it went to 22-0. We give ourselves a mountain to climb so a couple of things there: first of all we need to be better in the first place, in terms of not giving the opposition that many turnover opportunities, and it doesn't allow us to build pressure. And secondly if we do concede, how can we stem it quicker? We can't really let it get to 17-0 or 22-0, we can't let it do that, and we've done that twice in two weeks now.”\n\nFord could come under pressure for his place from Northampton’s Fin Smith when England face Italy in Rome on Saturday 7 March.",

The Huskers shut down the Aggies, 8-2, grabbing their fifth top-15 win of the season.\n\nJordy Frahm (3-3) and Alexis Jensen delivered the one-two punch on the day in the circle, combining for 14 strikeouts against seven hits, four walks and two runs. Nebraska's defense held Texas A&M to its second-lowest scoring game of the season. The Aggies average over seven runs a game.\n\nFrahm got the win for the Huskers, pitching 5.0 innings and striking out 10 batters, her second double-digit strikeout game of the season.

    "fullText": "England head coach Steve Borthwick has admitted that he will have to consider changes after a record defeat to Ireland at Twickenham – though defended Maro Itoje’s fitness despite again taking his captain off early.\n\nThe hosts were outclassed in a 42-21 defeat at the Allianz Stadium that all but ended their already fading title hopes as England suffered a second defeat on the spin.\n\nThe manner of the loss was striking, too, following up a similarly sloppy showing in Scotland to raise some tough questions for a side that had entered this Six Nations on a run of 11 consecutive victories.\n\nEngland were again let down by a horror start that saw Ireland seize a 22-0 advantage. Borthwick went to his bench early, bringing on hooker Jamie George for Luke Cowan-Dickie before the half-hour mark and introducing Marcus Smith at full-back just prior to the half-time interval.\n\nItoje, meanwhile, played just 54 minutes of his 100th cap before being replaced by Alex Coles. The lock is usually an 80-minute man for Borthwick but had endured a disrupted build-up to the Six Nations campaign due to both injury and the death of his mother.\n\n“I think Maro is in very good condition,” Itoje’s head coach stressed. “I think his sharpness will continue to develop. Ultimately, if you look from the end of the autumn to now, he only was able to play a couple of games due to an injury, but I think he will get fitter and fitter over this next period.”\n\nBorthwick, who also saw scrum half Alex Mitchell go off early with a soft tissue injury, also conceded that he may have to consider changes in personnel and strategy after back-to-back defeats.\n\n“I’ve been really clear on objectives for improvement,” Borthwick said. “We’ll look very closely at that over the next two days, so that we reconvene with the players that we ensure we’re specific about what we improve.\n\n“The team’s been very good at games that have been tight, even if we’ve gone one or two scores down and then been excellent in the second half and always come through to find a way to win. Unfortunately, for two games running now, we’ve given the opposition too much of a head start, giving ourselves a mountain to climb. We certainly need to address that.\n\n“My job over the next couple of days is to be really clear about that. Look at how I’ve set the team up over the last 18 months that’s led to consistently high-level performance and results, and look at that for the last couple of games, and then decide on what needs to change. I’ll look at the medical status of all the players and then understand what we need to do going forward.”\n\nAfter the fallow week, England take on Italy in Rome before finishing their campaign against Six Nations favourites France in Paris. They will head to Verona to train between those two fixtures, rather than returning home.\n\nOne of Marcus Smith and George Furbank, who is back to full fitness, could come under consideration at full-back ahead of Freddie Steward, while Borthwick may also mull giving Fin Smith a start at fly half.\n\nJack van Poortvliet and Ben Spencer are the options within the squad to replace Mitchell if the scrum half is ruled out, and Chandler Cunningham-South’s physicality could see the versatile Harlequins forward make his first appearance of the campaign.",

    "fullText": "For most of the 2025 college football season, the Auburn defense carried the team while the offense struggled. One of the many bright spots on that side of the ball was freshman safety Eric Winters. He was really good against the run, and Pro Football Focus graded him as the top run defender in the SEC at 92.\n\nAs a true freshman, Winters recorded 33 total tackles and picked up one sack during the 2025 season. His lone sack of the season occurred against the Texas A&M Aggies in a 16-10 loss. His best tackling game of the season was against South Alabama, with five total tackles in the 31-15 win. Winters showed his potential in the 2025 season opener on the road at Baylor with three tackles. He will factor into the 2026 Auburn defense and should see more time on the field as a potential starter.\n\nWinters was a four-star prospect coming out of high school when he signed with the 2025 class. He played high school football at Enterprise High School in a very tough 7A-Region 2. Some coaches have tabbed the region as the SEC of 7A football in Alabama, with teams like Auburn High, Central Phenix City, Opelika, and Dothan High. During his senior season in 2024, Winters had 60 tackles and three tackles for loss. He also played on offense and scored five rushing touchdowns.\n\nWinters will not just be one of the top defensive players for the Auburn Tigers, but also one of the best in the SEC. One of the many young players Auburn fans should be very excited about.\n\nContact/Follow us @TheAuburnWire on  X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "EDITOR’S NOTE — The victory by the U.S. men’s hockey team over the heavily favored Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics is widely regarded as one of the greatest upsets in sports history.  LAKE PLACID, N.Y.",
    "fullText": "EDITOR’S NOTE — The victory by the U.S. men’s hockey team over the heavily favored Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics is widely regarded as one of the greatest upsets in sports history. With the American men winning Olympic hockey gold for the first time since — 46 years to the day — The Associated Press is republishing two stories from that night as printed Feb. 23, 1980, in the Pottsville (Pa.) Republican:\n\nLAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — Driven by their own emotion and the cheers of a frenzied, star-spangled crowd, the United States hockey team has delivered what may well be the most stunning upset in Olympic history and stands on the verge of a medal at the 1980 Winter Games.\n\nCall it Team Excitement. This ambitious, energetic squad of college kids ignored adversity and bounced from behind on third period goals by Mark Johnson and Mike Eruzione to score a stunning 4-3 upset victory over the defending champion Soviet Union Friday night.\n\nWith roars of “USA! USA! USA!” ringing in their ears, America’s comeback kids rode the red-hot, 36-save goaltending of Jim Craig to a sensational victory that set off a wild celebration, first on the ice and then all over this Olympic town.\n\nJust as the hockey game ended, fireworks exploded over Mirror Lake – part of the traditional awards ceremony saluting Friday’s medal winners, including American slalom racer Phil Mahre. But the coincidence was just too good for the flag-decked crowd that spilled happily into the narrow streets of this tiny village after the American hockey victory.\n\n“In all due respect to that team and to the (American) silver medal team in 1972, this has to be the biggest win in our Olympic history,” said Coach Herb Brooks.\n\nWhen the United States swept to the Olympic gold in 1960, the Soviet Union was not yet the hockey powerhouse it is today. The Russian team America beat 20 years ago was still refining its game. The one America beat Friday night is acknowledged by most hockey people to be the finest unit in the world – and that includes professionals, who these Soviets have often handled with ease.\n\nBrooks knew all that when he delivered his pre-game speech to his team. It was simple and to the point. This is what he told newsmen: “You are born to be a player. You are meant to be here. This moment is yours. You’re meant to be here at this time. Let’s have poise and possession with the puck.”\n\nAnd then he sent Team Excitement on the ice.\n\nThree times the young Americans fell behind by a goal and each time they came back, first on a goal by Buzz Schneider and then one by Mark Johnson.\n\nJohnson’s goal came with a single slim second left on the clock in the first period. But the Soviets regained the lead again in the second period and limited the Americans to two shots on goal in those 20 minutes. Again, they seemed in control.\n\nThen, midway through the final period, Johnson and captain Mike Eruzione scored goals just 81 seconds apart, putting the United States in front.\n\nStill, there were 10 minutes to play and that can be an eternity. It seemed like one for the Americans, who turned back every Soviet thrust and then exploded in joyful excitement at the final buzzer. They tackled each other and rolled happily on the ice like so many excited kids, while the Soviets stood and waited for the traditional handshaking ceremony.\n\nThe loss was the first in Olympic competition for the Soviets since 1968 and left the Americans needing only a victory over Finland Sunday to clinch the gold. But the Russians still have a shot at the gold. To win it, they would have to beat Sweden Sunday and hope that Finland defeats the United States.\n\nSweden tied Finland 3-3 in Friday night’s other medal round game. That left the United States with three points, the Soviets and Swedes with two and Finland with one in the mini-tournament to determine the medals.\n\nLAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) — For a change, it was the Soviet hockey players who looked on in envy. Downcast, they leaned on their sticks, awaiting the ceremonial handshake that concludes every international contest.\n\nUsually, it is they who act the gracious winner’s role. But this time, this one Friday at the Winter Olympics, it was the Americans’ turn; their 4-3 victory had made the conquerors the conquered.\n\nHockey gold medal hopes are alive and well in Lake Placid. The Americans are one victory over Finland away from making their gold medal dream a reality.\n\n“I’m going to bite myself to make sure it’s true,” said right wing John Harrington.\n\nOh, it’s true all right – just as true as the dramatic pre-game pep talk by Coach Herb Brooks; as true as the winning burst of third-period goals by Mark Johnson and Mike Eruzione in a 1:21 span ... just as true as the phone call from President Jimmy Carter to the clamorous American dressing room.\n\n“He said we had made the American people very proud; that we reflected the ideas of the country and what we stand for,” said Brooks, who – along with the entire American Olympic delegation – has been invited to the White House Monday.\n\nThe invitation stands no matter what happens Sunday, and any number of things might. The Americans, this dramatic victory theirs forever, could still finish out of the medals chase if badly beaten by Finland. They could win a bronze, or a silver, or a gold.\n\nThis is how it stands: After Friday’s two medals round games (Sweden and Finland tied 3-3 in the other), the Americans have three points, the Soviets and Swedes two, and Finland one. If Sweden ties the Soviet Union Sunday and Finland beats the Americans, all would have three points. If Finland’s victory is a big one, the infamous “goal differential” (goals given up subtracted from goals scored) would break the tie and leave the U.S. with nothing to show for its smashing, upset triumph Friday.\n\nIf virtually anything else happens other than a lopsided U.S. loss, the Americans will win a medal.\n\n“But we’ll worry about that tomorrow,” said Mark Johnson after the Americans had knocked goalie Vladislav Tretiak out of the game, rallied from three one-goal deficits, and stunned the Soviet team that has won the last four Olympic golds and was heavily favored to repeat.\n\nIf the Soviets went ahead, the Americans rallied. Finally, on a power play at 8:39 of the third period, a Dave Silk pass bounced off the skate of defenseman Sergei Starikov and bounded right to Johnson. A five-foot shot was all it took for a 3-3 tie, and Eruzione netted a 25-footer at the 10-minute mark to settle the issue.\n\nFor the fifth time in the six games they have played her, the Americans gave up the first goal. Vladimir Krutov tipped an Aleksei Kasatonov shot past goalie Jim Craig at 9:12 of the opening period.\n\nBuzzy Schneider brought the United States back at 14:03, powering a 55-foot shot over Tretiak’s left shoulder and marking the beginning of the end for the internationally acclaimed net-minder. Tretiak’s vulnerability is long shots, and his muff of another one helped the Americans tie it with one second left in the period.\n\nSergei Makarov had fought away from a Johnson check to flip a 15-foot shot past Craig at 17:34, but – with the clock winding down and the crowd of 8,500 screaming “U-S-A, USA,” the U-S-A stormed back. Dave Christian took a 100-foot shot on Tretiak, who kicked it directly in front of Johnson.\n\nA few fakes later, the game was tied 2-2 and Tretiak was gone. Vladimir Myshkin, who beat the National Hockey League all-stars 6-0 to win the Challenge Cup for the Soviets last February, took over.\n\nHe fared no better, and the Soviets suffered their first loss in an Olympic hockey game since 1968, when the Czechs beat them 5-4 at Grenoble, France.\n\nPeople charged into the streets when it was over, waving the flags they had brought to the game, hollering the chant that is their trademark and going every bit as crazy as the players did themselves.\n\n“We went nuts,” said (Rob) McClanahan. “ What do you do when you win a game like this? You whoop it up. You hug each other. You shake hands.”\n\nAP Corporate Archives contributed to this report.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — The first female president in the International Olympic Committee’s 132 years got a proper stress test in the first games of her history-making leadership.\n\nKirsty Coventry was widely seen as having good overall success at the Milan Cortina Winter Games that also gave a taste of challenges set to be tougher running into the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\n“An incredible games, and an incredible experience for me as my first in this role,” she told IOC colleagues Sunday.\n\nCoventry insisted in Milan pre-games that “our game is sport,” yet playing politics was inevitable.\n\nShe started the Winter Games building “very good chemistry” with U.S. Vice President JD Vance — who was booed at the opening ceremony — and had seemed likely to close it with U.S. President Donald Trump, who she has not yet met. He did not travel as many expected for Sunday's men’s ice hockey final that the U.S. won.\n\nIn between, political pressure on Coventry was intense during the days-long drama of the Ukraine skeleton racer’s helmet memorializing athletes and coaches killed in the Russian military invasion.\n\nCoventry’s face-to-face, trackside meeting with Vladyslav Heraskevych early Feb. 12 that failed to avert his disqualification has helped define her leadership style.\n\nHer tears in a subsequent meeting with international media is a powerful image of her presidency — though Heraskevych himself wasn't impressed.\n\nThe next day, at a news conference in Milan, a list was detailed to Coventry of IOC issues with its own finances, plus future Olympic hosts, their officials and governments.\n\n“It’s a job only a woman could do,” she said with relish, “and I’m looking forward to continuing to do it.”\n\nThe Ukrainian political strategy had been “a baptism of fire” for the new president, the former IOC marketing director Michael Payne told The Associated Press on Sunday.\n\nCoventry going directly to engage Heraskevych in sports diplomacy was a shift from her predecessors Thomas Bach and Jacques Rogge, who also were Olympic athletes.\n\nAt age 42, having swum for Zimbabwe as recently as the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Coventry is just 13 months older than a huge star at these games, Lindsey Vonn.\n\n“We saw at these games her values and her humanity,” IOC member Tricia Smith, a silver medalist in rowing for Canada at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, told The Associated Press. “And I think that’s exceptionally positive for the Olympic Movement as we move forward.”\n\nThe 72-year-old Bach sat next to Coventry again Sunday at the IOC’s meeting: He in suit and tie, she in smart casual knitwear that is becoming her signature look.\n\nThe generational change is clear for the Olympics, which wants and needs to stay relevant with athletes who are increasingly their own tech-savvy brands.\n\nAfter seven years as sports minister in the government of Zimbabwe, Coventry was no management rookie.\n\nOne of her four IOC vice presidents, Pierre-Olivier Beckers, said in Milan that people who had thought she was too young to lead were wrong.\n\n“I think she’s maturing at an incredible pace,” Beckers told reporters, adding she was “a joy for people like me to work with. Her ability to surround herself, to listen to people, all advisors, to make up her mind quickly, is just astonishing.”\n\nOne aspect of Coventry's management style that drew negative reactions, online and in Milan, was criticizing staff in her last set-piece media event Friday.\n\nCoventry is one of the more transparent leaders among the Olympic sports bodies mostly based in Switzerland. She had four scheduled news conferences in Milan within 20 days, plus an impromptu media session after meeting Heraskevych.\n\nOn Friday, she publicly lost patience when asked about news developments that she said she was unaware of — on the topics of Russian doping, an Olympic bid from Germany, and FIFA president Gianni Infantino attending Trump's Board of Peace launch Thursday.\n\nClearly frustrated, Coventry eventually said “maybe someone needs to be dismissed because I’m not aware of that either” and asked of her media team: \"What happened guys? Where are we?”\n\nCoventry has a big 2026 with signature policy to be decided under the “Fit for the Future” banner. Reviews are ongoing into how the IOC picks games hosts, Olympic sports and sponsor programs, plus protecting female sports.\n\nKey meetings are in the IOC's Swiss home city Lausanne on June 24-25 with more likely late in the year.\n\nThe next Olympics is a constant focus. There is a pressing issue around L.A. Games organizing chief Casey Wasserman, that was persistent in Milan over news of his historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend, and Coventry will soon need to meet Trump.\n\n“She can leave (Milan) with a massive sigh of relief. The brand is in robust health,” Payne said Sunday.\n\nHe warned of more politicization of Olympic sports worldwide before the next Olympics in the United States. The IOC winning the appeal brought by Heraskevych will help set limits on how athletes express views.\n\n“L.A. will be a completely different dimension,” Payne said. “It’s going to be complicated, to put it mildly.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "title": "Chris Weidman uses Aaron Pico as warning not to rush Gable Steveson",
    "description": "Chris Weidman, who joined UFC at 4-0, warns of the potential pitfalls of putting Gable Steveson at the top level too soon.",
    "fullText": "Chris Weidman is high on Gable Steveson's potential to be the next great MMA heavyweight, but he knows that any early career misstep can prove costly.\n\nWeidman was once the highly decorated wrestler who transitioned to MMA with much promise. He went on to fulfill that by becoming just the eighth fighter at the time to become UFC champion with an undefeated record when he upset Anderson Silva to claim the middleweight title at UFC 162 in July 2013.\n\nLike almost all in the sport, Weidman's time on top didn't last forever, and he's now retired from competition and serves as a desk analyst for the UFC. Although his wrestling accolades don't match that of Olympic gold medalist Steveson, nor did the era of his rise match the hype of today's social media era , Weidman can still relate to Steveson's process.\n\nMany fans and analysts want to see Steveson join the UFC heavyweight division today. Joe Rogan already sees him as championship-calibre. His octagon debut is unavoidable and happen sooner than later, and Weidman admits that could be scary for the 25-year-old's development.\n\n\"The thing that was different (about my debut) is that I was fighting the best guys in the country early on before I got to UFC,\" Weidman told MMA Junkie. \"There was no padding fights where I'm just looking to get comfortable inside the octagon before I get to the UFC. I fought Uriah Hall in my third fight. We're both undefeated. My fourth fight was a guy with like 20 fights. Really good record. I felt a little bit more prepared because I wad fighting higher-level guys.\n\n\"When he does go to the UFC – the thing with the heavyweight division is there is going to be guys he fights where it's like padding your record again. It's like the Bo Nickal thing where you keep him away from certain guys and get them to a certain path. But he's going to have to get streamlined because the heavyweight division needs it.\"\n\nThere is much to be excited about with Steveson and his potential. He has surrounded himself with a strong team including Greg Jackson and Brandon Gibson as coaches, as well as UFC legend Jon Jones as a mentor. The foundation is there, but Weidman cited Aaron Pico as an example of how things can go irredeemably wrong.\n\nPico made his pro debut with the now-defunct Bellator MMA organization at 19 and with hype as the greatest prospect in the sport's history. He was finished in three of his first seven fights, however, and although Pico has gone on to have a respectable career, he has yet to meet the potential initially placed on him, and was most recently on the wrong end of a 2025 Knockout of the Year contender vs. Lerone Murphy.\n\n\"Aaron Pico was such a freaking beast wrestler and was a golden glove champion,\" Weidman said. \"His hands were unbelievable. I think he lost his first fight. Everyone always asks me, 'What do you think of this guy? Do you think he's going to be a good fighter?' You never know. You can be a good fighter but you can lose your first fight, and how do you deal with that? Now you chin is a little bit more suspect than usual. Poor Aaron Pico, man. His skillset is so good, and I hate to even say it, but is his chin there anymore? He got knocked out too many times early in his career. It just sucks to see because his potential is so high. He was going against tough competition a little bit too early.\"\n\nUltimately, Weidman hopes Steveson is best positioned to succeed and his ambition is tapered by reality. Steveson moved to 3-0 in his career on Thursday when he mauled an overmatched Hugo Lezama for a first-round TKO, once again circulating buzz around his inevitable UFC arrival.\n\n\"The guy looked like he was fighting for his life and he knew it was over and he was just trying to land something big before it was over. It was a little sloppy,\" Weidman said. \"His last fight before that looked way more clean. The way he exploded from a left hook into a beautiful takedown. ... This fight looked like, 'OK, still a little green. Still a little green in there.' Which is to be expected. But man, the sky's the limit for that guy, for sure.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Chris Weidman: Gable Steveson shouldn't be rushed to UFC title",

    "fullText": "TESERO, Italy — The race marshal has just cried out his five-minute warning, but Jessie Diggins appears lost to it all.\n\nThere is a ritual to these moments, to this preparation, and in her final Olympic appearance, the USA’s most decorated cross-country skier of all time will remain unhurried. Her universe is defined by the particulars.\n\nShe still wears a hefty plaster on her ribs, the blueing medal of a crash that took place just two kilometers into her Olympics on the opening Saturday. “It’s honestly caught me off guard with how much it hurts to ski right now,” she wrote in a post on Instagram.\n\nJust five days later, Diggins won bronze, her fourth Olympic medal overall, in the 10-kilometer freestyle.\n\nHer red headband is already on, bearing, as always, the logo of The Emily Program — the eating disorder charity that helped her through the most difficult moments of her career, which she now wears as a reminder, not to herself but others.\n\nUnder Olympic rules, she will have to take the headband off before the race starts. No such regulations exist for the glitter daubed on her cheeks, battle paint mimicked by hundreds in the grandstand facing her.\n\nNow, and only now, she climbs into her race vest. The number is one. At 34, and in her last season, Diggins leads the World Cup standings. She may well win the crystal globe in Lake Placid next month, her final meet before retirement.\n\nThat number gives her a privilege. She moves to the front of the racers’ queue, a rare pass she has not had to work for. Silence falls, tangible enough to be sketched by charcoal. Then the gun.\n\nAnd so she begins, one final time, pushing pell-mell into a sport increasingly shaped in her image.\n\nSunday was the debut of the women’s 50km at the Olympic Games. Diggins had long advocated for its inclusion, incensed at the inequality with the men’s events, the insinuation that women were only able to race 30km.\n\n“When I got to the World Cup, I didn’t understand why,” she said in a pre-Olympic press conference. “Why do we not get to do these big, epic races that are pretty iconic and pretty legendary in our sport?”\n\nShe got to do it in her final Olympic race. The previous night, the withdrawal of the overwhelming favourite, Sweden’s Frida Karlsson, sparked the obvious question: Could Diggins sign off with an Olympic medal?\n\nOne impediment was the format. The 50km was raced in the classic style, with Diggins far stronger in the freestyle “skate” technique, in which she has taken the vast majority of her World Cup wins. The length, however, was expected to favor Diggins — an athlete with the preternatural ability to dig deeper than human suffering should allow.\n\nIt is why she chimes with so many. Watch her win the team sprint relay in Pyeongchang eight years ago alongside Kikkan Randall, the USA’s first-ever Olympic cross-country gold. It is visible that none of this comes easy as she double-poles herself forward, gasping like a gutted fish.\n\nWatch her at any finish line, and she is liable to collapse, spent, knowing she extracted every ounce of ability that day. “I’m going to die,” she hyperventilated after her bronze in the 10km.\n\nBut this is only part of Diggins’ relationship with pain. She has been open about her eating disorder, first suffering from bulimia in her teens, managing it, becoming an Olympic champion, and relapsing in 2023.\n\n“If someone out there is watching this or listening to this or reading this, and they’re struggling, you can do this too,” she said during these Olympics. “And I know that because when I was 18, I thought that would be my life. And I thought my life would actually be quite short because of my eating disorder. I was in a really tough place.”\n\nRecovery came, an effort she calls the most difficult push of her career. Diggins learned to weaponise her vulnerability, to use her experience to help others. In a sport known for its unhealthy relationship with weight, she is the biggest advocate for breaking the taboo. The U.S. cross-country team, pushing a wider trend across the sport, has now made body image an open conversation.\n\n“You can survive without an eating disorder in professional sports,” she wrote in a blog post for The Emily Program updated this January. “More than that, you can thrive. The eating disorder I once relied on hurt my career in the short term. It did not ruin my life.”\n\nOver the past seven years, she has lived by a mantra: Just because I’m good at being in pain, it doesn’t mean I always have to be.\n\nDiggins is hurting now. Dropped by the leaders at the end of the first lap, she hauls her way back on the downhill. Another lap later, and approaching the 15km mark, she is down to sixth and struggling with her skis.\n\n“I was doing everything I could to make them work,” she said post-race. “I knew I had to switch them early.”\n\nShe veers to the left, strapping on her alternate pair. With 30 seconds lost, she is now down to ninth. Urgently, she heaves herself back onto the tracks — and stumbles, twice, her knees hitting the snow. The skis bend but do not crack.\n\nHer only option is the same as it ever was. Chase up the course ahead.\n\nThere have been other stumbles by U.S. athletes during these Olympics. Most notoriously, figure skater Ilia Malinin fell twice during last the men’s final, tearing away a gold medal that had looked destined to be his for the past four years. It was visible, and it was public.\n\nIn the days after, Malinin demonstrated his own vulnerability. He spoke openly about the pressure of the Olympics, of his own mental health; he used his own fall to lift others. Malinin is his own man, but this is also the environment Diggins has engendered.\n\nThere are traces of her approach, too, in the performance of Alysa Liu, gold medalist in the women’s final six days later. Liu’s story, having placed well-being above performance before recognising how that self-awareness ultimately made her stronger, has hallmarks of Diggins’ recovery.\n\n“(Diggins) is so valuable because of not only her talent, but because of how she’s really present with us as a team,” Diggins’ teammate, 23-year-old Kendall Kramer, said after the 50km. “She just wants to give tips, pointers and pass the flag to the next generation.\n\n“Going to the World Cup for the U.S. is really hard because we can’t just travel back home. It would be easy for her to keep really to herself, but she’s created such a good environment, a culture that makes our team special.”\n\nDiggins may have four Olympic medals and seven in world championships. But this is the other subtext of her legacy — demonstrating to the winter sport community that there is another way of excellence.\n\nCharging up the slush of the Dolomites, Diggins’ career is not over yet. The middle laps of this race have been a masterclass in tactical planning.\n\nUp front, Sweden’s Ebba Andersson and Norway’s Heidi Weng are too far ahead, but at this moment, Diggins is the quickest athlete on course. Her skis are now fresh, better able to handle the conditions than her fading rivals.\n\nThe dull glint of bronze resembles the low sun in the sky. But for Diggins, perhaps more than any other athlete at these Games, her performance and the result are not distinct; for her, the performance is the result. She forges on, mainly with skiers 10 years her junior.\n\n“Literally every muscle in my body started cramping with three laps to go,” she recalled post-race.\n\nOthers change their skis and begin to recover. Diggins starts to drop back on the uphills — one second off the back, back with the group, two seconds off, back with the group — but remains grimly with her quintet. The pain on her face progresses like erosion; it starts with a trickle of sweat, cracks becoming writ across her forehead, before, where her mouth should be, a yawning chasm.\n\nFive minutes up the course, Andersson drops Weng to win the race. She has her own redemption story — three falls in the women’s 4×7.5km relay, condemning her team to silver. It was the only women’s race in which Sweden failed to take gold — but Andersson’s joy is unbridled here.\n\nThen, after an embrace in the finish area, both still gasping, Andersson and Weng both shade their eyes to stare back up the hill.\n\nThe group is thinning in the fight for bronze, the Austrian and Finnish contenders gone. Diggins has the inside track up the final hill, but Switzerland’s Nadja Kaelin is the only athlete still appearing to possess the ability to glide up the slope.\n\nRounding the crest, they disappear from view. When they reemerge, it is Kaelin double-poling her way to third, followed by Norway’s Kristin Austgulen Fosnæs in fourth. Just five metres behind her, Diggins claws her way to fifth.\n\nHer final effort is all she has. Swaying upright on her skis as she crosses the line, her body veering a little to the right, she collapses on the racing line as if sliced behind the knees. The only motion is her chest’s rise and fall. It is over.\n\nAndersson is straight over, gently touching Diggins on the shoulder. Thirty seconds later, Kaelin has recovered enough to unclip the skis, which now awkwardly sit on her rival’s feet. Diggins is too exhausted to even unclasp her poles from her hands; all she can do is softly pat Kaelin on the calf in thanks. In the world Diggins has created, this is what it looks like to go out on your shield.\n\nIt is some five minutes before she is able to walk, but as she comes back to life, she picks out her father behind the ropes. “I’m so happy,” she tells him. Then a spark and a laugh. “ZERO KICK,” she intones.\n\n“If you had told me even a year ago that I’d be in the fight for a bronze medal in a 50k classic, I would not have believed you,” she elaborates to reporters soon after. “I can confidently say that I could not possibly have tried harder or gotten more out of my body. The fact I was able to come back and finish this race after getting so hurt just two kilometers into my Olympics? I’m just so grateful for the staff behind the scenes.\n\n“I got to end it on a beautiful day and at a venue that I love so much. I’m just really proud of this last Olympics, really grateful, and really happy. I’m leaving here full of joy … and probably needing a new body.”\n\nDiggins may not have finished with a medal, but this was an Olympic career that finished on her terms: unafraid to ask herself questions, journeying deeper than anyone else to find the answers, in a race of her own construction.\n\nAnd surely she always knew, and probably hoped, that it would end like this; lungs and muscles emptied, breath slowly misting into the air, lying spread-eagled on the snow.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nOlympics, Global Sports, Women's Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Lucas Bergvall, still only 20, has moved from promising teenager to prized asset in little over two years, and Tottenham have now placed a figure on his head that speaks volumes.\n\nAccording to Swedish news outlet Fotboll Direkt, “Spurs now value Bergvall at around £57m (€65m / $77m). The Reds have registered their interest in him and are closely monitoring developments in case there is an opportunity to pounce.”\n\nThat is a bold valuation for a player who arrived in north London for £8.5million, yet it reflects both performance and potential.\n\nBergvall’s journey has been swift. After 12 senior appearances for Brommapojkarna, he joined Djurgardens in February 2023 and quickly established himself as one of Europe’s most refined teenage midfielders. Barcelona were keen, yet Spurs secured the deal, a move that now looks inspired.\n\nSince arriving in July 2024, Bergvall has demonstrated composure beyond his years. He plays with his head up, scanning for angles, measuring tempo, gliding through midfield traffic. An ankle injury has temporarily halted his momentum, yet it has done little to diminish his standing.\n\nSpurs’ head scout Rob Mackenzie described him as a “genuine generational talent”, a phrase that invites scrutiny but underlines the belief within the club. When David Ornstein reported that Spurs rejected approaches from Chelsea and Aston Villa in January, it was clear that Bergvall was not for sale at a discount.\n\nNow, with Spurs languishing in 16th place and doubts surrounding interim manager Igor Tudor, circumstances may test that resolve.\n\nLiverpool’s interest adds intrigue. Arne Slot’s side have reportedly entered the race, and scouts have been busy.\n\nLiverpool’s midfield rebuild in recent seasons has focused on energy, intelligence and long term value. Bergvall fits that brief. He is technically secure, tactically flexible, and already accustomed to the rhythm of English football.\n\nVilla are also in the frame, and the wider context matters. Spurs face the prospect of missing out on European football again. Revenue, prestige and player retention are often intertwined. Should the season drift further, suitors may sense vulnerability.\n\nBergvall is not the only Tottenham player attracting Liverpool’s attention. Reports indicate that scouts have repeatedly watched Luka Vuskovic during his loan spell at Hamburg. Manchester City, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are said to admire him too, with Spurs valuing the defender at €60 to 70m.\n\nMicky van de Ven has also been identified as a potential option should Liverpool need to replace Ibrahima Konate. This pattern suggests strategic planning rather than opportunism.\n\nFor Spurs, the challenge is clear. Retain elite young talent and build around it, or risk becoming a stepping stone for rivals. For Liverpool, the question is whether £57m represents foresight or excess.\n\nBergvall’s story remains in its early chapters. Yet as Fotboll Direkt’s reporting highlights, the stakes are rising, and the Premier League’s power dynamics may soon feel the impact.\n\nFrom a Tottenham perspective, the £57m valuation feels both protective and necessary. Supporters have watched Bergvall mature quickly, and there is pride in seeing a young midfielder dictate games with authority. Selling now, especially to Liverpool, would sting deeply. It would reinforce fears that Spurs struggle to hold their brightest prospects when pressure mounts.\n\nFor Liverpool, the appeal is obvious. Bergvall represents succession planning, a player who could anchor midfield for a decade. Fans would view such a move as a statement of intent, particularly if rivals are circling. Yet £57m demands consistency and resilience, not flashes of promise.\n\nBoth sets of supporters understand that talent alone does not guarantee trophies. Structure, stability and ambition matter equally. Bergvall sits at the centre of that tension, admired in north London and coveted on Merseyside.",

    "fullText": "The reigning NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder still have all of their goals in front of them. They very well could become the first back-to-back league champions in almost a decade this coming June. But they have to be careful with their health, which has been shaky this season and could ultimately sink their hopes.\n\nThey better be especially careful with the status of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is missing Sunday's home showcase game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The star shooting guard suffered an abdominal strain just before the All-Star break and will now have missed seven straight games. The bad news for the Thunder is that Gilgeous-Alexander will miss some more time moving forward.\n\nThe good news is that his return is still relatively imminent. He should be back in the Thunder lineup in about a week or so:\n\nThe Thunder say Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (abdominal strain) and Ajay Mitchell (abdominal strain/left ankle sprain) are out at least one more week … with Jalen Williams (right hamstring strain) to be re-evaluated in approximately two weeks.\n\n— Marc Stein (@TheSteinLine) February 19, 2026\n\nPresuming Gilgeous-Alexander's recovery continues to go smoothly, this timeline means we could see Gilgeous-Alexander return in a Friday home date against the Denver Nuggets this coming week. Or perhaps on the road on Sunday against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nEither way, the Thunder should be able to breathe a deep sigh of relief very soon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander injury update: When will Thunder star return?",

    "fullText": "Alexis Mac Allister said Liverpool must reflect on their performance despite his 97th-minute goal snatching a 1-0 victory at Nottingham Forest on Sunday.\n\nThe Reds had been toothless in attack against a side battling relegation until the closing stages.\n\nMac Allister had a goal ruled out when the ball came off his arm as he charged down Ola Aina's attempted clearance.\n\nThe Argentine World Cup winner then slotted in deep into stoppage time and this time the goal did stand despite Hugo Ekitike standing in an offside position earlier in the move.\n\n\"Mixed feelings to be honest,\" said Mac Allister. \"I love scoring, I love winning, so in that sense I think it's a really good day.\n\n\"But on the other hand, I don't think we played very well. There's plenty of things we need to improve.\"\n\nLiverpool remain in sixth for now, but victory took Arne Slot's men level on points with Chelsea and Manchester United in the battle for a place in next season's Champions League.\n\nMac Allister, though, was particularly critical of their flat first-half performance as goalkeeper Alisson Becker kept his side in the game.\n\n\"We need to analyse during the week but the first half wasn't good at all. Positioning, intensity, pressing - nothing was good,\" added the former Brighton midfielder.\n\n\"It was not good and it was not our standards. In the second half, I wouldn't say it was good, but it was a little bit better.\n\n\"We had some chances and the most important thing is that we won the game.\"\n\nLiverpool were dealt a blow before kick-off as Florian Wirtz was injured in the warm-up.\n\nHowever, Slot is hopeful the German will not be sidelined for long.\n\n\"We don't think it is very serious, but he felt his back too much during the warm-up to start,\" said Slot.\n\n\"So, we decided not to play him.

Sometimes accepting reality can be difficult, but McVay has taken “refuse to lose” somewhat literally.\n\nHe’s had a seemingly impossible time accepting the Seattle Seahawks victories in the playoffs and Week 16, calling the Seahawks lucky after the NFC Championship Game.\n\nSean McVay called it a “fortuitous bust” in coverage to have two guys peel on Kyren Williams in the flat on the final play on the Rams penultimate drive. pic.twitter.com/S22iocgtqm\n\n— Henry McKenna (@henrycmckenna) January 26, 2026\n\nI asked Demarcus Lawrence about the 4th an 4 stop against the Rams in the NFC Championship \n\nSean McVay called it lucky\nBut it was intentional\n\nHe explains why pic.twitter.com/YfW8fKNO2N\n\n— Joel Moran (@joelvmoran) February 3, 2026\n\nNow, the Los Angeles Rams are reportedly going to propose a rule to change the two-point conversion, the advanced lateral (post-incorrect whistle) known as The Zachwards Pass. Zach Charbonnet picked up what was initially ruled an incomplete forward pass while in the end zone, but upon video review it was ruled that Sam Darnold threw a backwards pass and that Charbonnet’s recovery was a good, game-tying conversion. Seattle tied the game at 30-30, fell behind in overtime, but still won on an Eric Saubert two-point try.\n\nThe Rams reportedly will propose a rule change regarding the wacky two-point play by the Seahawks that arguably altered the course of the season. https://t.co/GbgT6fDrwA\n\n— ProFootballTalk (@ProFootballTalk) February 21, 2026\n\nThe actual content of the proposed change is not yet known. Suspicion would be that it suggests a change to either the way the review was conducted, or about when and how a backwards pass can be advanced.\n\nWatch it again here, and while you do, imagine McVay losing his ever-loving mind.\n\n\"Is this the craziest 2-point conversion EVER?\"\n\nThe @Seahawks tie it up in a WILD way 😳\n\nLARvsSEA on Prime Video\nAlso streaming on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/KwNtEIWVQ7\n\nTraditional rules do not allow a fumble to be advanced by anyone but the fumbling player in the final two minutes of the half, or on 4th down. Unironically, a two-point conversion does feel somewhat close to either of those scenarios, although it should be noted that backwards passes are technically not fumbles even though they’re recorded as such in the game book. It will potentially be the most interesting rule proposal taking place this offseason.\n\nNot that Seattle was going to put it in their playbook on purpose, but this will be worth monitoring all the same.",

    "description": "The Longhorns won both the men's and women's titles.",
    "fullText": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Since joining the Southeastern Conference, the Texas Longhorns have taken the league by storm.\n\nIn two years, they’ve won all four team titles in swimming and diving.\n\nTexas was the biggest change to the league in 2025, and although it once again swept the championships, the SEC looked different in 2026.\n\nThe meet was defined by a lack of COVID-19 fifth-years, new roster limits, top-end speed and a new event schedule.\n\nHere are the main takeaways from this year’s SEC swimming and diving championships:\n\nA year ago Texas took over the SEC in the pool and on the boards. In 2026, the Longhorns pulled off another sweep, winning both the men’s and women’s title.\n\nThe scariest part: The squad from Austin still had room to improve.\n\nThe Texas men left no doubt, holding down first place from the start. The women’s meet was close through three days of competition, but the Longhorns' elite depth proved to be too much for the rest of the conference.\n\nThe Texas men are the blueblood in collegiate swimming. With 16 national championships to their name, the Longhorns have been title contenders for the past four decades. They have also won 28 consecutive Big 12 titles, which is every single year of the league’s existence until they left for the SEC. It’s no surprise they have taken over the conference.\n\nHubert Kos’ SEC performance encapsulated the dominance of the Texas men. The 2024 Olympic 200-meter backstroke gold medalist won two of his three events. His most impressive feat is that he swam two championship finals on Saturday night and won gold in the 200-yard IM and silver in the 200-yd backstroke, with only about 45 minutes of rest between the two swims.\n\nTo put it simply, Texas has the talent of a pro roster. Whether it’s young stars or veteran leadership the Texas men have it.\n\nOn the women’s side the Longhorns were fueled by the pure depth of the roster.\n\nCampbell Stoll and Angie Coe both won two of their three events. Stoll swept the 100-yd and 200-yd butterfly while Coe swept the 200-yd and 400-yd IM’s.\n\nThe Longhorns freshman and sophomore classes reinforced the team’s strengths and were a major factor in their seven wins this week.\n\n“Great competition, a lot of fun…this environment brings out the best in our team,” Texas women’s head coach Carol Capitani said after the meet.\n\nTexas will now set its sights on the NCAAs in March where the women look to compete for another top-three finish and the men look to repeat as national champions.\n\nFor four years Florida’s Josh Liendo dominated SEC waters.\n\nHe’s a 19-time All-American, two-time Olympian, and, as of this week, an 18-time SEC champion.\n\nLiendo stole the show at this year’s SEC championships. After winning his fourth straight 100-yd butterfly and first 50-yd freestyle title this week, Liendo has cemented himself as one of the most successful swimmers in SEC history.\n\nHe swam the 100-yd butterfly in 43.06 seconds, the second fastest of all time behind Caeleb Dressel. That morning he swam the fastest preliminary time in history in 43.26 seconds.\n\nLiendo has broken SEC records, posted the fastest splits in history, and led relays to multiple NCAA championships in NCAA record fashion. However, he has never broken an individual NCAA record.\n\nStill eluding Liendo is what many considered an untouchable record. Dressel holds the national record in the 100-yd butterfly at 42.80 seconds. Achieving that mark would move Liendo into the top tier of all-time collegiate swimmers.\n\nLiendo ended his SEC career on a low note, falling to LSU’s Jere Hribar in the 100-freestyle final, spoiling his perfect week. Hribar’s win was the breakout swim of the meet, stealing the gold, posting the fastest time in the country this year and breaking Liendo’s SEC meet record.\n\nRegardless, all eyes will be on Liendo come March. The senior will be the focal point of the NCAA championships, and he has a chance to become one of the most recognizable names in collegiate swimming history.\n\nAs the final race came to a close, Texas wasn’t the only team celebrating its week in Knoxville.\n\nThe Tennessee Lady Volunteers left their home pool with smiles on their faces and momentum on their side. The Lady Vols have only two seniors on the roster, and were able to jump up to second in the team standings after a third-place finish in 2025.\n\nCamille Spink dominated the sprints, sweeping the 50-yd, 100-yd and 200-yd freestyle for the second year in a row. She won the 50-yd freestyle in SEC meet record fashion, becoming the sixth woman to ever break 21 seconds, stopping the clock at 20.87.\n\nSpink is now the fourth-fastest performer of all time in the 50-yd free and fifth fastest in the 100-yd freestyle.\n\n“Nobody does it like a Tennessee Vol,” Spink said in her postrace interview after winning her third straight SEC 50-yd freestyle title.\n\nTennessee won three of the five relays and set two SEC conference records in the process in the 200-yd and 400-yd medley relays. Japanese Olympian Mizuki Hirai, junior world record holder in the 100-meter butterfly, was the catalyst Tennessee needed for championship season.\n\nTennessee has the No. 1 signing class arriving next fall and the Lady Vol sophomore class stacked up 12 medals this week, including two individual golds. With only two seniors graduating in 2026, the Lady Vols are set up for success in the near future.\n\nSEC records were falling throughout the week, but one of the biggest takeaways from the week was the way the depth of the conference fluctuated in 2026.\n\nThe meet saw success by a new wave of freshmen and sophomores, noted by Capitani in her postmeet interview on ESPN. The field was young and extremely talented, but also inexperienced.\n\nThere was no lack of speed from the top-end talent in Knoxville, but the overall conference depth took a hit in 2026.\n\nIn the men’s 400-yd IM, it took a time of 3:52.26 to get a second swim in the finals session. In 2025, swimmers had to be 3:47.63 to be in the top 24. That’s a 4.63-second difference year-over-year.\n\nThe men’s 50-yd freestyle field was impressive, which saw nine men break the 19-second barrier. However, the majority of events saw that times for 24th place were slower than a year ago.\n\nThat raises the question: Why? There are a number of factors. In the past year, men’s rosters in the SEC were limited to 22 and teams were forced to cut a significant chunk of their rosters. This means smaller training groups, less margin for error and less depth on a team-by-team basis.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC reordered the event lineup for the meet in 2026, changing the flow of a typical swimming and diving championship meet event order.\n\nThe final factor could be the turnover in athletes. Last year was the final time COVID-19 fifth-year swimmers dominated finals, as the majority of the class that were freshman in 2022 aged out of college athletics.\n\nOverall, there are a lot of moving parts in non-revenue sports, and the SEC experimented in many different ways in 2026.",

    "description": "Virginia’s women stamped their imprint on nearly every race and locked up another ACC crown.",
    "fullText": "Dominance and drama collided at the 2026 ACC Swimming and Diving Championships.\n\nVirginia’s women swam with commanding control, stamping their imprint on nearly every race and locking up another ACC crown. On the men’s side, California edged past Stanford in a much closer battle for the conference title.\n\nHere are the main takeaways from this year’s ACC swimming and diving championships.\n\nAfter five straight NCAA titles, there was no doubt the Virginia women would continue to succeed in 2026. However, there was a question whether they would continue to dominate without Alex and Gretchen Walsh.\n\nVirginia and head coach Todd DeSorbo reminded the rest of the NCAA that the Hoos are still the most dominant force in collegiate swimming.\n\nThe Cavaliers opened competition posting the second-fastest time in NCAA history in the 800 freestyle relay, surpassing a Stanford quartet that featured Katie Ledecky and Simone Manuel.\n\nIt seemed like the meet was over before it even started as the Virginia women had extended a sizable lead after the first full day of swimming competition, winning three out of the four swimming events. They again posted the second-fastest swim in history, this time in the 200 freestyle relay, trailing only themselves from the 2024 ACC Championships.\n\nOlympic medalist Claire Curzan is the Hoos’ X-factor as she threw down an NCAA record in the 200-yd back, stopping the clock in 1:46.09. Curzan also clocked the second-fastest 100-yd backstroke in NCAA history, behind only Gretchen Walsh. Curzan was named the ACC most valuable swimmer of the meet after winning four gold medals.\n\nAnna Moesch has had a major breakout season. This week, she became just the fourth woman to break 1:40 in the 200 freestyle. The sophomore is now just six-tenths of a second off Missy Franklin's legendary NCAA record of 1:39.10 set back in 2015.\n\nOverall, the Virginia women racked up 11 total titles en route to their seventh straight ACC championship. This team has young stars, suffocating depth, and will enter the NCAAs as the clear favorite for a sixth straight national title.\n\nThe California men are 2 for 2 as members of the ACC, but this year it came down to the last day of competition.\n\nThe Bears locked up the 2025 title early on, winning the meet by over 200 points, but it was a different story in 2026.\n\nStanford and Cal faced off in a seven-round heavyweight battle. Through a full week of competition, there was little separation.\n\nRelay scoring was almost dead even between the two and the Cardinal outscored the Bears in diving; it was the points gained from individual swimming events that secured the win for the defending champs.\n\nCalifornia’s Yamato Okadome led the way, winning three gold medals in the 100-yd breast, 200-yd breast and 400-yd medley relay.\n\nThe Bears didn’t win the meet because of total titles, as California won only four individual and relay events overall. Stanford also won four and the North Carolina State men won seven ACC titles, but lacked the complete team that California brought to Atlanta.\n\nThe California men were second at last year’s NCAA championships and will look to compete for another top-three spot in March.\n\nAlthough seniors like Stanford’s Torri Huske and Lucy Bell found success, winning nine ACC medals, the conference has turned over a new leaf.\n\nUnderclassmen found continued success throughout the week filling up championship finals and winning half of the ACC individual titles.\n\nFreshmen and sophomores won a staggering 16 individual events. In comparison, they collected only seven wins in 2025.\n\nSeven freshmen finished in the top eight in the men’s 500-yd freestyle, and NC State freshman Max Carlsen won it. The lone fifth-year, Cal’s Eduardo Oliveira de Moraes, was fourth.\n\nCarlsen also won the 1,650-yd freestyle, and UVA sophomore and U.S. Olympian Katie Grimes doubled up winning the 500-yd free and 1,650-yd freestyle.\n\nLouisville freshman true freshman Nikita Sheremet posted the second-fastest 18-and-under 100-yd freestyle of all-time, and he’s now tied with NC State’s Kaii Winkler, who placed second in the event this year as a sophomore. Sheremet also won silver in the 50-yd freestyle.\n\nMoesch, a sophomore, swept the 100-yd and 200-yd freestyles, knocking off Huske in the 100.\n\nOkadome, who was the ACC’s most valuable men’s swimmer of the meet, is just a sophomore as well. Additionally, half of Cal’s 20 athletes who scored points were underclassmen.\n\nThe trend continued in diving, as Stanford freshman Ellie Cole and Stanford sophomore Misha Andriyuk swept the platform events.\n\nThis week showcased that the ACC is ready to compete for national titles and top-five finishes at the NCAAs in March.\n\nThe Virginia women are the standard in collegiate swimming, but Stanford, Louisville, California, and NC State were also impressive.\n\nThe Louisville women knocked off Virginia in the 200-yd medley relay and NC State’s Eneli Jefimova 100-yd breaststroke is now the fastest in the country after this week.\n\nThe California women have been in rebuilding mode over the past several years and are now catching stride as they broke a school record in the 200-yd medley relay. Sophomore Mia West also won Cal’s first ACC title in the 200-yd butterfly.\n\nOn the men’s side, Texas and Arizona State are going to be tough to catch nationally, but Cal, Stanford, and NC State look ready to race come the end of March.\n\nStanford’s Henry McFadden posted a top-five time in the country this year in the 200-yd freestyle, and Okadome's times in breaststroke stack up with the best in the NCAA this season.\n\nNC State’s 200-yd freestyle relay and 400-yd freestyle relay teams broke the ACC meet and conference record. In the 400-yd freestyle relay they finished four-tenths of a second faster than the SEC champion Florida Gators.\n\nThe impressive times in the pool and exquisite diving on the boards set up the ACC for an exciting close to the 2026 season.",

    "description": "The Conference Board Leading Economic Index® (LEI) for the United States",
    "fullText": "The Conference Board publishes leading, coincident, and lagging indexes designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle for major economies around the world.\n\nUpdated: Thursday, February 19, 2026\n\nUsing the Composite Indexes: The Leading Economic Index (LEI) provides an early indication of significant turning points in the business cycle and where the economy is heading in the near term. The Coincident Economic Index (CEI) provides an indication of the current state of the economy. Additional details are below.\n\nThe Conference Board Leading Economic Index® (LEI) for the US declined by 0.2% in December 2025 to 97.6 (2016=100), following a 0.3% decline in November and a downwardly revised 0.2% decline in October. Overall, the LEI fell by 1.2% over the second half of 2025, a substantial improvement from its 2.8% contraction over the first half of 2025.\n\n“The US LEI registered its fifth consecutive monthly decline in December, indicating continued softness in the economy in early 2026,” said Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, Senior Manager, Business Cycle Indicators, at The Conference Board. “Alongside a rise in building permits, positive contributions to the LEI in December were led by the index’s financial components, with the yield spread notably turning positive in both November and December.\n\n“However, persistently weak consumer expectations indicators and the ISM® New Orders Index made the largest negative contributions to the LEI in December. Labor market data also weighed on the Index, with an increase in unemployment claims and a decline in average weekly hours in manufacturing. Overall, the LEI signals weaker economic activity at the start of this year. The Conference Board projects a slowdown in growth in Q4 2025 and early 2026, with GDP set to expand by 2.1% YOY in 2026, from a forecasted 2.2% in 2025.”\n\nThe Conference Board Coincident Economic Index® (CEI) for the US rose by 0.2% in December 2025 to 115.0 (2016=100), after a downwardly revised increase of 0.1% in November. Overall, the CEI expanded by 0.3% over the second half of 2025, slightly down from its 0.4% increase over the first half of last year. The CEI’s four component indicators—payroll employment, personal income less transfer payments, manufacturing and trade sales, and industrial production—are included among the data used to determine recessions in the US. Nearly all improved in December, but personal income less transfer payments and manufacturing and trade sales were estimated for the month.\n\nThe Conference Board Lagging Economic Index® (LAG) for the US inched down by 0.1% to 119.6 (2016=100) in December 2025, reversing a 0.1% increase in November. The LAG was unchanged in H2 2025, significantly down from the 1.2% increase over the previous six months (H1 2025).\n\nThe next release will be announced at later date based on data releases from Census Bureau.\n\nNOTE: The chart illustrates the so-called 3Ds—duration, depth, and diffusion—for interpreting a downward movement in the LEI. Duration refers to how long the decline has lasted. Depth denotes the size of decline. Duration and depth are measured by the rate of change of the index over the most recent six months at an annualized rate. Diffusion is a measure of how widespread the decline is among the LEI’s component indicators—on a scale of 0 to 100, a diffusion index reading below 50 indicates most components are weakening.\n\nThe 3Ds rule signals an impending recession when: 1) the six-month diffusion index lies at or below 50, shown by the black warning signal lines in the chart; and 2) the LEI’s six-month growth rate (annualized) falls below the threshold of −4.3%. The red recession signal lines indicate months when both criteria are met simultaneously—and thus that a recession is likely imminent or underway.\n\nAbout The Conference Board Leading Economic Index® (LEI) and Coincident Economic Index® (CEI) for the US\n The composite economic indexes are key elements in an analytic system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. Comprised of multiple independent indicators, the indexes are constructed to summarize and reveal common turning points in the economy in a clearer and more convincing manner than any individual component.\n\nThe CEI reflects current economic conditions and is highly correlated with real GDP. The LEI is a predictive tool that anticipates—or “leads”—turning points in the business cycle by around seven months.\n\nThe ten components of the Leading Economic Index® for the US are:\n\nThe four components of the Coincident Economic Index® for the US are:\n\nTo access data, please visit: https://data-central.conference-board.org/\n\nThe Conference Board is the member-driven think tank that delivers Trusted Insights for What’s Ahead®®.

    "title": "Unsung heroes: Flickr's URLs scheme",
    "description": "A blog about software craft and quality",
    "fullText": "Half of my education in URLs as user interface came from Flickr in the late 2000s. Its URLs looked like this:\n\nflickr.com/photos/mwichary/favorites\n\n flickr.com/photos/mwichary/sets\n\n flickr.com/photos/mwichary/sets/72177720330077904\n\n flickr.com/photos/mwichary/54896695834\n\n flickr.com/photos/mwichary/54896695834/in/set-72177720330077904\n\nThis was incredible and a breath of fresh air. No redundant www. in front or awkward .php at the end. No parameters with their unpleasant ?&= syntax. No % signs partying with hex codes. When you shared these URLs with others, you didn’t have to retouch or delete anything. When Chrome’s address bar started autocompleting them, you knew exactly where you were going.\n\nThis might seem silly. The user interface of URLs? Who types in or edits URLs by hand? But keyboards are still the most efficient entry device. If a place you’re going is where you’ve already been, typing a few letters might get you there much faster than waiting for pages to load, clicking, and so on. It might get you there even faster than sifting through bookmarks. Or, if where you’re going is up in hierarchy, well-designed URL will allow you to drag to select and then backspace a few things from the end.\n\nFlickr allowed to do all that, and all without a touch of a Shift key, too.\n\nAny URL being easily editable required for it to be easily readable, too. Flickr’s were. The link names were so simple that seeing the menu…\n\n…told you exactly what the URLs for each item were.\n\nIn the years since, the rich text dreams didn’t materialize. We’ve continued to see and use naked URLs everywhere. And this is where we get to one other benefit of Flickr URLs: they were short. They could be placed in an email or in Markdown. Scratch that, they could be placed in a sentence. And they would never get truncated today on Slack with that frustrating middle ellipsis (which occasionally leads to someone copying the shortened and now-malformed URL and sharing it further!).\n\nIt was a beautiful and predictable scheme. Once you knew how it worked, you could guess other URLs. If I were typing an email or authoring a blog post and I happened to have a link to your photo in Flickr, I could also easily include a link to your Flickr homepage just by editing the URL, without having to jump back to the browser to verify.\n\nFlickr is still around and most of the URLs above will work. In 2026, I can think of a few improvements. I would get rid of /photos, since Flickr is already about photos. I would also try to add a human-readable slug at the end, because…\n\n flickr.com/mwichary/sets/72177720330077904-alishan-forest-railway\n\n …feels easier to recall than…\n\n flickr.com/photos/mwichary/sets/72177720330077904\n\n(Alternatively, I would consider getting rid of numerical ids altogether and relying on name alone. Internet Archive does it at e.g. archive.org/details/leroy-lettering-sets, but that has some serious limitations that are not hard to imagine.)\n\nBut this is the benefit of hindsight and the benefit of things I learned since. And I started learning and caring right here, with Flickr, in 2007.

    "description": "Magic folders in git forges: what .github/, .gitlab/, .gitea/, .forgejo/ and .",
    "fullText": "Git doesn’t know about CI, code review, or issue templates, but every forge that hosts git repositories has added these features through the same trick: a dot-folder in your repo root that the forge reads on push. The folder names differ, the contents overlap in some places and diverge in others, and the portability story between them is worse than you’d expect. A companion to my earlier post on git’s magic files.\n\nGitHub also reads some files from the repo root or from .github/: SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, LICENSE.\n\nThe .github/workflows/ directory contains YAML files defining Actions workflows. Each file is a separate workflow that runs on events like push, pull request, or schedule.\n\nCODEOWNERS uses gitignore-style glob patterns to map paths to GitHub users or teams who must review changes:\n\nGitLab’s main CI config is .gitlab-ci.yml at the repo root, not in the folder. Projects often keep reusable CI templates in .gitlab/ci/ and pull them in with include:local, though the directory name is convention rather than something GitLab treats specially.\n\nGitLab’s CODEOWNERS works similarly to GitHub’s but with different approval rule options and integration with GitLab’s approval workflows.\n\nGitea and Forgejo (a fork of Gitea) support:\n\nForgejo checks .forgejo/ then .gitea/ then .github/ in that order, while Gitea checks .gitea/ then .github/, so you can keep shared config in .github/ and add platform-specific overrides in the forge’s own folder.\n\nGitea’s CODEOWNERS uses Go regexp instead of gitignore-style globs. Patterns look like .*\\.js$ instead of *.js.\n\nBitbucket keeps two files in .bitbucket/:\n\nCI config lives at bitbucket-pipelines.yml in the repo root, similar to GitLab’s approach.\n\nBitbucket’s CODEOWNERS has reviewer selection strategies baked into the syntax:\n\nrandom(1) picks one random reviewer from the team, least_busy(2) picks the two reviewers with the fewest open PRs, and all requires every team member to review. No other forge has reviewer selection strategies in the CODEOWNERS syntax.\n\nThe .bitbucket/teams.yaml file lets you define ad-hoc reviewer groups without creating formal Bitbucket teams:\n\nThese can then be referenced in CODEOWNERS with the @teams/ prefix, like @teams/security or @teams/frontend.\n\nIf you host the same repository on multiple platforms, shared config in .github/ will be picked up by Gitea and Forgejo, with platform-specific overrides in .gitea/ or .forgejo/ taking priority. Bitbucket and GitLab only check their own folders, so multi-platform support across all forges still requires some duplication.\n\nGitHub’s org-level .github repository lets you set default issue templates, PR templates, and community health files for every repo in the org, but the fallback is all-or-nothing: if a repo has any file in its own .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ folder, none of the org-level templates are inherited and there’s no way to merge them. The org .github repo must also be public, so your default templates are visible to everyone.\n\nGitHub looks for CODEOWNERS in three places: .github/CODEOWNERS, then CODEOWNERS at the root, then docs/CODEOWNERS. First one found wins and the others are silently ignored. The syntax looks like .gitignore but doesn’t support ! negation, [] character ranges, or \\# escaping. A syntax error used to cause the entire file to be silently ignored, meaning no owners were assigned to anything. GitHub has since added error highlighting in the web UI but there’s still no push-time validation.\n\nGitLab supports optional CODEOWNERS sections with a ^ prefix, but “optional” only applies to merge requests. If someone pushes directly to a protected branch, the docs say approval from those sections is “still required,” though how that actually works for a command-line push is unclear even to GitLab users.\n\nThe Gitea/Forgejo workflow fallback is all-or-nothing too: if .gitea/workflows/ contains any workflow files, .github/workflows/ is completely ignored, so you can’t run platform-specific workflows side by side.\n\nGitea’s CODEOWNERS doesn’t check .github/CODEOWNERS at all, only ./CODEOWNERS, ./docs/CODEOWNERS, and .gitea/CODEOWNERS. If you migrate from GitHub with your CODEOWNERS in .github/, it silently does nothing. And even when it works, CODEOWNERS on Gitea isn’t enforceable: it adds reviewers but there’s no branch protection option to require their approval. Anyone with write access can approve. CODEOWNERS also didn’t apply to fork PRs until Gitea 1.21.11.\n\nForgejo and Gitea both inherited the pull_request_target trigger from GitHub Actions compatibility, which means they also inherited the “pwn request” attack surface where a fork’s code runs with the base repo’s secrets. Forgejo added a trust-based approval system for fork PRs, but pull_request_target workflows still run with write tokens.\n\nCVE-2025-68937 is a symlink-following vulnerability in .gitea/template and .forgejo/template files. An attacker creates a template repository with symlinks pointing at sensitive paths like the git user’s authorized_keys, and when someone creates a new repo from that template, the symlinks get dereferenced during template expansion, allowing the attacker to write arbitrary files on the server. It affected Gitea since v1.11 and Forgejo through v13.0.1.\n\nForgejo also fixed a cache poisoning vulnerability where PR workflows could write to the shared action cache, letting a malicious PR poison future privileged workflow runs. It’s unclear whether Gitea is affected or fixed this quietly, as they haven’t published a corresponding advisory.\n\nGitHub Actions expressions are case-insensitive. $ matches whether the branch is main, MAIN, or mAiN. Context accesses like secrets.MY_SECRET and SECRETS.my_secret resolve to the same thing. Git itself is case-sensitive, so if your workflow security depends on branch naming conventions, there’s a mismatch that’s easy to miss.\n\nIf you know of other forge-specific folders or have corrections, reach out on Mastodon or submit a pull request on GitHub.",

    "description": "Amid rising US healthcare costs, Cara West found relief in medical tourism. Her family saved thousands getting tests and scans done in Turkey.",
    "fullText": "Cara West, 34, often seeks medical care abroad due to high prices in the US.\n\nThe longtime Texas resident has sought care in Greece, Turkey, and Portugal.\n\nThe family is likely to move abroad permanently, in part due to America's high cost of living.\n\nCara West had never seen such a gorgeous hospital.\n\nThe 34-year-old is traveling the world with her husband and toddler and often seeks medical care abroad rather than in their hometown of Austin, Texas. Last summer, they flew to Istanbul for a primary care check-up. They stayed at a hotel, boarded the morning shuttle arranged by their medical tourism agency, and began a full-day itinerary.\n\nEach family member received bloodwork, scans, an EKG, and doctor consultations over the next few hours. West's daughter even got her eyes checked. As a midday break, they ordered lunch at the hospital's restaurant, complete with a menu featuring items like veggie omelettes and raspberry cheesecake. It all felt \"luxurious.\"\n\nWhen the bill came, the total was $1,330 before insurance — and West is still in shock.\n\n\"There's this fear as an American because you know that medicine is so expensive and it's confusing,\" West said. She estimates the same check-ups would have cost her family thousands \n\nDo you have a healthcare or medical tourism story to tell? Reach out to this reporter at allisonkelly@businessinsider.com.\n\nAs healthcare prices climb in the US, Americans are looking for ways to cut costs. To avoid breaking the bank, more people are turning toward medical tourism. Some foreign hospitals — especially in places like Turkey — are even marketing themselves directly to American patients.\n\nData on the phenomenon is limited, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that millions of Americans seek healthcare abroad each year, most commonly in Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean. The market for international health insurance is expected to grow from nearly $32 billion in 2025 to $40 billion in 2030, and North Americans account for the largest share. Patients travel for a range of services, including cosmetic surgeries, reproductive procedures like IVF, and cancer care.\n\nWest and her husband first considered living abroad after the birth of their daughter in 2022. They were paying off expensive labor and delivery bills, and craving a more travel-oriented lifestyle. Temporarily relocating to a lower-cost-of-living city seemed like the perfect solution.\n\nWest was working remotely for a startup, and her husband took a break from his job as a restaurant manager. With a combined six-figure income, they had been living nearly paycheck to paycheck in Austin — but one salary was more than enough to comfortably afford life in Lisbon. They stayed for three months as part of a program for people interested in traveling and living abroad.\n\nIt was around this time that the family enrolled in an international healthcare plan. Their US employer-sponsored plans had become unaffordable and didn't meet their growing healthcare requirements while abroad, West said. They began regularly traveling overseas and wanted to ensure they could still easily fill prescriptions and visit urgent care when needed.\n\nWest enrolled in the international healthcare plan Genki, which covers doctor visits and hospital stays for travelers and digital nomads in most countries. It costs $657 a month for the family, but she said she was paying nearly twice that in Texas with much higher deductibles. The deductible for international coverage is $1,000, though West said, \"It's actually kind of hard to meet that, because the cost of medical care is actually very affordable.\"\n\nBesides the Istanbul hospital, the family has received medical care in Portugal and Greece. West said all were covered by her international plan. She advised others interested in medical tourism to read reviews, reach out to hospitals directly with questions, and try a video chat with providers first before visiting in person.\n\n\"I think a lot of people feel really uneasy because they think, 'I'm going to a foreign country, I'm going to get medical care. And what happens if something goes wrong?'\" she said. \"Honestly, it really is all about doing your research.\"\n\nWest's family recently settled on the Greek island, Syros. They love the sunshine and close-knit community, and their move from Texas is likely permanent. Cheaper healthcare costs are a main reason for their decision.\n\nAs an added bonus, West said the island is a Blue Zone. She hopes it's good news for their longevity.\n\n\"I've started learning from the older generation here,\" she said. \"All of the things that they do, and what they believe is keeping them healthy and young.\"",

    "title": "6 Physical Symptoms Of Dementia That You Really Should Know",
    "description": "Whether you have any of the symptoms or not, there are things you can do to reduce your dementia risk.",
    "fullText": "Getting older comes with many changes, not the least of which are occasional memory lapses, which tend to worry many people in the moment.\n\nThese cognitive changes can be totally normal, so there is no need to panic if you occasionally forget your sunglasses or the name of your son’s former teacher. But there is a clear difference between age-related cognitive changes and dementia.\n\nHealth: Experts Warn These Early Dementia Signs Often Get Missed — But Early Detection Makes A Big Difference\n\nRoughly 7 million people in America have dementia, and it’s expected that number will double by 2060. Experts say cognitive impairment becomes something more severe at a certain point.\n\n“The magic line that transitions someone from mild cognitive impairment to dementia is when one of their cognitive impairments is impairing function. For me, that’s one of the key parts of defining when someone has transitioned to dementia,” said Dr. Stephanie Nothelle, a geriatrician and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore.\n\nThis could mean no longer being able to use a car, getting lost while driving a familiar route or not being able to do one’s taxes after decades of doing them, she said. If cognitive changes make it tough to get through a normal day, that’s a red flag, she added.\n\nDementia is an umbrella term that describes multiple forms of cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia), vascular dementia and Parkinson’s, according to Nothelle.\n\nHealth: Nancy Guthrie's Disappearance Highlights A Common Issue For People With Aging Parents — And We Don’t Talk About It Enough\n\nThe exact manifestations of the disease depend on the actual diagnosis. And while cognitive impairment is a common thread, there are also some physical symptoms that tend to be associated with dementia. Here’s what they are:\n\n“I find that a lot of the more physical manifestations happen later in the course of dementia,” Nothelle said. But there is a physical issue that occurs earlier on and gets worse throughout the course of the disease, she said, and that’s “someone’s ability to walk and maintain balance.”\n\n“The ability to maintain your balance and walk smoothly, actually, it requires a lot of brain power because you have to process a lot of different inputs,” Nothelle noted.\n\nYou have to process sensations from your feet, you have to process what your eye is seeing in the environment around you and more. “You have to quickly react to these things, and so it’s a very cognitive task to be able to walk,” Nothelle said.\n\nHealth: I'm A Spine Doctor. Here's 1 Thing I'd Never, Ever Do If I Had Back Pain.\n\nBecause of all of this, trouble walking, trouble balancing and falling frequently is a sign of dementia. (But note that these issues aren’t only a sign of the disease; they can be due to arthritis or even clumsiness.)\n\nThe second-most-common form of dementia is Lewy body dementia, said Dr. Jori Fleisher, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush University in Chicago. This describes a few types of dementia, including Parkinson’s disease.\n\nIn this manifestation, you may notice posture changes, feet shuffling or that someone is walking slower than they used to, Fleisher said.\n\nWhile it’s easy to chalk these issues up to getting older, not paying attention or arthritis, “if we’re seeing a pattern of that, we want to pay attention to it,” she added.\n\nHealth: Is The Legs-Up-On-The-Wall Pose As Beneficial As Everyone Says?\n\nA change in your sense of taste or smell can be attributed to many issues, such as a COVID-19 infection or a history of sinus problems, but outside of known factors, unexplained changes in these senses can also be related to dementia.\n\n“Sometimes the person doesn’t notice it themselves, but their loved one is going, ‘Hey, something on the stove and was burning and you didn’t smell that,’” Fleisher explained.\n\nThis is a symptom that should push someone to see a doctor. While it may not be a sign of all forms of dementia, it is associated with Lewy body dementia, according to Fleisher.\n\nPeople with dementia may also experience trouble swallowing food and drinks.\n\nHealth: You Might Be Seeing A MAHA-Coded Doctor And Not Even Know It\n\n“People will be eating or drinking, and things will have a tendency to accidentally ‘go down the wrong pipe,’ so to say,” said Nothelle.\n\nIn this case, the food actually does go down the wrong pipe, she said. “If you have food or fluid that goes down your windpipe into your lungs, that’s not supposed to be there,” Nothelle noted.\n\nSaliva helps us swallow food and drinks, and “our mouths are full of bacteria,” she said. While some of the bacteria is good, some of it is not-so-good (hence cavities and gum disease) and if that bad bacteria ends up in your lungs with your food, it can set you up for infection, she explained.\n\n“We call that aspiration pneumonia, and that’s why pneumonia is relatively common in the later part of dementia,” Nothelle explained.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\n“Incontinence, unfortunately, can be a symptom of dementia,” said Nothelle.\n\nA lot of nerves are required for bladder control, “and those nerves degenerate as dementia progresses,” she said.\n\nSimilarly, folks may experience new constipation later in life, according to Fleisher.\n\n“That can also be a sign of Parkinson’s and related conditions, and often precedes the other symptoms by years,” Fleisher noted.\n\nAccording to Fleisher, sleep changes are also important to look out for.\n\nThe person experiencing sleep changes may not notice, but if you live with someone and find they’re moving around a lot at night, punching, shouting or talking in their sleep, it’s important to let their health care team know, Fleisher said.\n\n“That may be something called REM behavior disorder, which often can come years before a person has Parkinson’s or Lewy body dementia,” she added.\n\nIt can certainly be hard to admit to any health problems or changes, especially when it comes to cognition — but it’s important to do so.\n\nWe are living in a time of innovation when it comes to dementia treatments, said Fleisher.\n\n“There’s lots of different research going on right now to try to find treatments and pharmaceutical options for people,” Nothelle added.\n\nDoctors can check biomarkers in blood or spinal fluid to determine what kind of dementia someone has and make treatment decisions based on that, Fleisher said.\n\nNo matter what, it’s best to start treatments or interventions early on in the course of the disease, both Nothelle and Fleisher said.\n\nThe treatments aren’t a cure, but can help with disease management. More, an early diagnosis can also help families (and individuals) best prepare.\n\n“Finding out early on can be really helpful for a lot of different reasons, including planning and just having a say in your future,” said Nothelle. If you find out early, you often can still make some decisions, whether that’s your care, where you’ll live or financial choices.\n\nThis all makes it important to pay attention to any signs of dementia (either in yourself or a loved one) and reach out to a doctor if you notice concerning changes.\n\n“As scary as we know that this is, a diagnosis and knowledge and early detection is power,” said Fleisher.\n\nWhether you have any of the symptoms above or not, there are things you can do to reduce your dementia risk or slow down disease prevention. These include all of the things that go into a healthy lifestyle, both experts said.\n\nTo lower your chance of dementia, it’s helpful to follow a nutritious diet (Fleisher recommends the MIND diet), exercise, socialize with loved ones and manage chronic conditions like diabetes, high and sleep apnea.\n\nExperts predict that 42% of Americans over 55 will develop dementia in their lifetime, but there are things you can do to prepare for the disease if you get a diagnosis and things you can do to help lower your risk.\n\nThe original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.\n\nYou Can Cut Your Dementia Risk By Almost 30% With This 1 Thing, Study Says\n\nThese 5-Second Hand Exercises For Dementia Are Going Viral.

    "description": "While in New Delhi on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said \"there will come a time\" for orbital data centers, but it won't be anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk's SpaceX wants to launch satellites that act as data centers into space.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said placing data centers in space isn't feasible right now.\n\nHe called the idea \"ridiculous\" during an event in New Delhi.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman famously don't agree on much.\n\nThe latest point of contention: data centers in space. Musk has made it a priority. Altman thinks it's a fantasy, at least for now.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman said during a live interview with local media in New Delhi on Friday, causing audience members to laugh.\n\nAltman said that orbital data centers could \"make sense someday,\" but factors like launch costs and the difficulty of repairing a computer chip in space remain overwhelming obstacles.\n\n\"We are not there yet,\" Altman added. \"There will come a time. Space is great for a lot of things. Orbital data centers are not something that's going to matter at scale this decade.\"\n\nMusk would almost certainly disagree.\n\nWhile many Big Tech and AI companies are spending billions on data center construction on Earth, Musk's eyes are on the stars, per usual. Orbital data centers are his latest ambition, as he mentioned in an all-hands xAI meeting in December.\n\nIn February, SpaceX said its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers.\" The company has already begun hiring engineers to make that happen.\n\nDuring an all-hands meeting with xAI employees this month, Musk said SpaceX's acquisition of xAI will allow them to deploy the orbital data centers faster.\n\nDespite Altman's skepticism, other tech leaders are also racing to place data centers in space. Google's Project Suncatcher, unveiled in November 2025, aims to do just that. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Fox News Sunday the company could start placing data centers — powered by the sun — in space as early as 2027.\n\nTech and AI companies rely on data centers to power their products, like large language models and chatbots. Those data centers, however, can deplete water resources, strain power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the overall quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024, nearly four times the number from 2010.\n\nNow, proposed data center campuses in Texas, Oklahoma, and elsewhere are increasingly facing stiff resistance from local communities.",

    "description": "Analysts were largely expecting a supply glut that would push oil prices down through 2026. Instead, prices have rallied through the first months of the year.",
    "fullText": "Coming into 2026, the consensus view among oil analysts was that the crude market was entering a period of deep oversupply, likely to keep depressing prices throughout the year. In 2025, oil prices fell by roughly 20% as the glut widened.\n\nInstead, oil prices have seen an unexpected rally through the start of the year on a combination of geopolitical shocks and stronger-than-expected demand. Prices are now higher than they were six months ago, leaving traders \"focused on why a large global surplus ... has not translated into a sustained Brent price decline in 2026 year-to-date,\" Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in a note to clients.\n\nBut those two metrics don't necessarily have to move together, analysts told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"My thinking here is that those two things ... they could live together,\" Jorge León, the head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nFutures on Brent crude (BZ=F), the international pricing benchmark, have gained roughly 15% since the start of the year, while those on US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CL=F) are up a slightly smaller 14%.\n\nAs of January, the International Energy Agency has estimated that the oil market would be oversupplied by roughly 3.7 million barrels per day (bpd), what Macquarie analysts called an \"extraordinary oversupply\" in a recent client note.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC+, spent much of 2025 unwinding production cuts. In the Americas, US shale production has remained at record volumes alongside growth from other exporting nations in the region, while global demand for hydrocarbons was expected to broadly decline as the world turned toward electrification and other forms of green energy.\n\nBut prices have risen anyway as traders have priced in a variety of unexpected supply constraints and upticks in demand forecasts.\n\nSanctions from the US Treasury Department on Rosneft and Lukoil, two of Russia's largest oil producers, appear to have taken roughly 600,000 bpd off the market, while exports from the CPC pipeline, which runs between the Caspian and Black seas, have dropped by roughly 440,000 bpd to the lowest level in at least seven years after drone strikes at the Black Sea-side exporting terminal.\n\nAt the same time, growing prospects of military action by the US against Iran have sent oil prices surging on the possibility of disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global chokepoint that sees roughly 20 million bpd of petroleum products cross its waters. Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea have rerouted tanker traffic around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, tightening physical delivery markets and increasing freight costs for oil products moving between Europe and Asia.",

    "description": "Trump watches the polls but this is one he might want to skip.",
    "fullText": "It is no secret that Donald Trump keeps his eyes on polling numbers, but there is one that CNN highlighted this week that he will probably want to skip.\n\nBut it also might benefit him to look at it heading into the mid-terms because it just isn’t pretty for the president. And that is because, just a month after Kamala Harris was hit with an embarrassing low on the betting markets as far as her 2028 presidency hopes are concerned, she is now crushing Trump in a new NBC poll that looked back at the 2024 election.\n\n“Regrets … some folks had a few,” CNN data guru Harry Enten said pulling up the results on a screen during the segment.\n\nTrump won the election in Nov. 2024 by just more than a point and a half, per Enten, but in April of 2025 Harris had pulled ahead of him by a point among those polled about recasting their vote.\n\nAnd now she is ahead by a whopping eight points.\n\n“Kamala Harris wins in a redo, asking folks essentially if you could redo the 2024 election, how would you vote?” Enten explained. “She wins it by, get this, eight points. A massive shift from what we saw back in November of 2024 when Donald Trump won by a point, and I will note that this sample was weighted to the 2024 result in which Donald Trump won by a point. And yet Kamala Harris in this weighted sample, she wins by eight amongst the sample that voted for Trump by one.”\n\nEnten then explained how this could signal a swing come mid-terms.\n\n“It has a massive impact on voter sentiment about what may happen late this year,” he said. “Why do I say that? Because let’s take a look at the vote for Congress and this is very important. The 2024 Harris voters, they vote for the Democrats on average by get this, 89 points. The Trump voters vote for Republicans by 83 points.\n\n“This means that the Democratic base that voted for Kamala Harris is sticking with those congressional Democratic candidates more than the Trump voters are sticking with the Republican candidates,” he added. “ And that is why what you are seeing on that generic congressional ballot at this point is Democrats leaping ahead by about five points because the Trump voters are not sticking by Republicans as much as the Harris voters are sticking by the Democrats.”\n\nThe polling got uglier when individuals who didn’t vote in 2024 were added in.\n\n“It’s also people coming off the sideline, OK,” he said looking at the date for voters’ choice in the 2026 congressional elections if they didn’t vote in 2024. “Look at this. Democrats are winning that vote by a significant margin, by 16 percentage points. So you add on to that, the Harris voters sticking with the Democratic candidates, suddenly, you see hey, this is the way the Democrats are going to get back their congressional majority.”",

    "description": "“It had me nearly at death's door and there are times now where I can’t be the mom or wife I want to be,” said Vicki Purdey",
    "fullText": "Vicki Purdey, from Dorset, England, was diagnosed with a life-altering illness after her flu-like symptoms worsened\n\n\"Over a few days, I just felt worse and thankfully, my mom was there to call the ambulance,\" she recalled\n\nPurdey, 37, is now reliant on a wheelchair while also suffering from brain fog and frequent eye spasms\n\nA mother is trying to regain her mobility after an illness that began with flu-like symptoms left her unable to walk.\n\nVicki Purdey, a mother of two from Dorset, England, was “fit and well” before experiencing symptoms — including a fever, severe headaches, muscle aches and light sensitivity — in March 2024. In an interview with news agency SWNS, Purdey, 37, recalled thinking that she just had a “seasonal illness” before her life-altering diagnosis.\n\nIt wasn’t until her 75-year-old mom, Julie, found out that she had begun to vomit and slur her words that she dialed the U.K.’s emergency telephone number 999.\n\n“I was fit and well and at the height of my life,” Purdey told SWNS. “So when I first started feeling unwell, I thought it was just the flu.”\n\nShe continued, “I remember waking up with a headache and some pains and not thinking much of them. I honestly thought it was just the flu and the symptoms would subside. But over a few days, I just felt worse and thankfully, my mom was there to call the ambulance.”\n\nPurdey was admitted to Poole Hospital on April 1 of that year after being unable to touch her chin to her chest when asked by doctors. A series of tests and a lumbar puncture then confirmed that she had viral meningitis.\n\n“At the hospital, I was pumped with antibiotics as my body was somewhat shutting down,” Purdey recalled, per SWNS. “But when I heard meningitis, the words hit me like a train.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nWhile receiving hospital treatment, Purdey said her body showed a “few signs” that she wasn’t fully recovering.\n\n“I remember walking to the loo and I just lost the coordination to walk,” she said. “It was the strangest thing and doctors assumed it was because I was [kept] in bed for ages.”\n\n“On top of this, I also developed short-term memory loss and there was a time when I couldn’t recognize my neighbor,” Purdey added.\n\nThe mother was discharged after a week but readmitted on April 15 with recurrent meningitis. She found out the illness had affected the neurological pathways of her brain so much that she “lost most use” of her legs.\n\nFurther testing led to her being diagnosed with a functional neurological disorder (FND). The condition, triggered by meningitis, causes the brain to have trouble sending and receiving signals, resulting in a wide range of issues, such as loss of sensation and touch in the body.\n\nPurdey believes she may have contracted the illness a week before she was diagnosed.\n\n“My boy was feeling unwell and I was sitting in A&E,” she said of her 6-year-old son, Freddie. “It seemed like the only place where I would have been exposed and my symptoms soon started later.”\n\nPurdey’s second hospital admission lasted four days. She was told that her mobility would likely take a few weeks to return. However, two years have since passed with her reliant on a wheelchair to get around.\n\n“I essentially lost sensation from the waist down and my independence took a severe hit,” said Purdey, per SWNS, adding that it’s been “incredibly isolating.”\n\n“Never did I think it would be meningitis,” Purdey added. “Many people think it’s an illness that only affects babies and young persons — but that’s not the case.\n\n“It had me nearly at death's door and there are times now where I can’t be the mom or wife I want to be,” she continued. “FND has impacted my ability to coordinate and walk and it needs more awareness and resources.”\n\nPurdey regularly attends physiotherapy and exercises to boost her mobility. Her hip sockets are “back to front,” rotating her top half 180 degrees, according to SWNS. Due to the FND diagnosis, she also suffers from brain fog and around 20 eye spasms a day.\n\n“I still have little sensation in my legs and rely on my wheelchair,” said Purdey. “I suffer with flare-ups occasionally and it means I need to re-learn how to walk in a new way each time. It’s a battle, but I am learning more about myself and the support from friends and family has been great.\"\n\nThe mother said resources for FND sufferers are “limited” despite the rising number of people who have the condition.\n\n“I’ve had a real rubbish past couple of years and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone,” Purdey told SWNS. “Even though I am trying my hardest to recover. I don’t think I ever will, but I hope my story can help others to become more aware of the symptoms of meningitis and FND.\"\n\n“You are not alone,\" she concluded.",

The state is the top producer of wild salmon in the world.\n\nCaught locally and tucked between two buttered buns, the deep-fried catfish sandwich is best paired with a side of fries and slaw.\n\nThough the famed French Dip originated in this sunny state, California is best known for its avocados. Try one of California's fresh avocado club sandwiches to see why.\n\nYou've heard of the Denver omelet, but have you heard of the Denver sandwich? It's a traditional Denver omelet filled with diced ham, onions, and green bell peppers, and then stuck between pieces of toast. Extra points if you add ham and hash browns.\n\nConnecticut is known for its non-traditional hamburgers, which are served on white toast with a choice of onion, tomato, or cheese, but no condiments. Try one at Louis' Lunch in New Haven.\n\nAnyone visiting this seafood-obsessed state should try a soft-shell fried crab sandwich topped with coleslaw and leafy greens.\n\nThe Sunshine State is known for its Cuban sandwich, which features generous portions of ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard on two slices of Cuban bread.\n\nThose visiting Georgia — the original home of Chick-fil-A — should partake in a classic fried chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and spicy mayo.\n\nKālua-style pork is common fare at most luaus, but the slow-roasted and shredded meat is also amazing on sandwiches. Try yours with pineapple coleslaw for an extra Hawaiian punch.\n\nThe Best Sandwich Shack in Idaho really lives up to its name. Locals swear by the \"Meat Your Maker\" — a combo of steak, Italian sausage, bacon, and more.\n\nIllinois is known for an open-faced sandwich called the Horseshoe, made with thick-sliced toasted bread, your choice of meat, and topped with french fries and a secret cheese sauce.\n\nIndiana claims to have the best pork tenderloin in the nation. Put it to the test by tasting a Hoosier sandwich, or a breaded tenderloin on bread.\n\nPurists insist on trying it with only a few dill pickles and some mustard, but you can also get it with lettuce, tomato, and other fixings.\n\nIt's made with unseasoned ground beef, sauteed onions, and sometimes topped with pickles, ketchup, or mustard on a bun.\n\n\"Runza\" or \"bierocks\" are a bun-shaped bread pocket filled with beef, cabbage or sauerkraut, onions, and seasonings. The recipe was spread by German immigrants to the Midwest.\n\nIt consists of an open-faced sandwich with turkey and bacon covered in cheesy Mornay sauce and baked or broiled until the sauce begins to brown.\n\nThe classic po'boy is made with French bread and roast beef or fried seafood. A \"dressed\" po'boy has lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayonnaise, onions, and hot or regular mustard.\n\nWhat else would you order in Maine but a classic lobster roll? Served on a lightly grilled bun and filled with steamed and buttered lobster, these sandwiches taste like summer.\n\nYou can find some of America's freshest crabs in Maryland. Try a crab cake sandwich on a buttered bun with lettuce, tomato, and onion.\n\nIf you've never tried the Fluffernutter sammie, you're missing out.\n\nIt's made with soft white bread topped with peanut butter and marshmallow Fluff, which was invented by Archibald Query of Somerville, Massachusetts.\n\nZingerman's Deli in Ann Arbor is known for its corned beef sandwiches, especially the Oswald's Mile High, which is made with corned beef and yellow mustard on double-baked, hand-sliced Jewish rye bread.\n\nThough the war over which restaurant invented it continues, Minnesota is the official home of the Jucy Lucy — a burger cooked with cheese on the inside that oozes out at the first bite.\n\nIt consists of two tender pig ears served on a small bun with mustard, slaw, and hot sauce.\n\nFeast on Missouri's famous Gerber, an open-faced sandwich with French bread, garlic butter, ham, provolone, and paprika, and then perfectly toasted.\n\nMontana is known for its huckleberries, which grow in the wild during the summer and fall seasons. Try its famous huckleberry jam for a delicious PB&J.\n\nIt's made with corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Thousand Island dressing, and is best served on rye bread.\n\nSome variations contain five burger patties with bacon and, of course, a side of fries.\n\nOne of the proudest accomplishments of this state is its delicious maple syrup. Order a fried ham and cheese Monte Cristo drizzled with it for the ultimate breakfast sammie.\n\nStop by any Garden State diner and try the signature Jersey breakfast sandwich. It's thick-cut Taylor ham (or pork roll) with egg and American cheese on a hard Kaiser roll or bagel.\n\nA cheeseburger is one thing, but a green chile cheeseburger takes it to a whole other level. This state's signature vegetable adds a major kick to this classic American dish.\n\nThere's nothing more NYC than a pastrami sandwich from Katz's Delicatessen in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The famous deli, which opened its doors in 1888, is one of the city's oldest delis and arguably the most famous deli in the country.\n\nScores of celebrities and politicians have frequented the restaurant over the years, and it was even featured in the classic 1989 romantic comedy \"When Harry Met Sally.\"\n\nKatz's is where the iconic \"I'll have what she's having\" scene took place.\n\nJust like Hawaii, one of North Carolina's best sandwiches is pulled pork, but make sure to smother it in a tangy, vinegar-based barbecue sauce.\n\nThis state's huge Scandinavian population loves their Smørbrød, a classic open-faced sandwich commonly made with rye bread, roast beef, Gravlax (a type of salmon), butter, lettuce, Jarlsberg cheese, pickled herring, hard-boiled eggs, honey mustard, or cucumber.\n\nNot to be confused with Louisiana's po' boy, Ohio's Polish boy is a sausage sandwich native to Cleveland. It has a link of kielbasa covered with a layer of french fries, barbecue or hot sauce, and coleslaw, all on a bun.\n\nWhat's better than chicken-fried steak? That same breaded and fried steak on a hamburger bun with your choice of condiments.\n\nPortland is known for its delicious vegan food. Falafel pitas, in particular, are a popular choice, packed to the brim with veggies and hummus.\n\nThe state's most famous food by far is the classic Philly cheesesteak.\n\nThinly cut steak handsomely topped with cheese on a roll is delicious by itself, but don't be afraid to add sautéed onions, peppers, mushrooms, mayonnaise, hot sauce, salt, pepper, or ketchup.\n\nThis tiny state is home to a very big sandwich. The Dynamite, which hails from Woonsocket, is a sloppy Joe burger made with onions, bell peppers, and celery. Be careful — it is spicy.\n\nPeople say the tuna melt was born in 1965 in South Carolina at the Woolworth's lunch counter. Head there and see for yourself why this simple delicacy is a Charleston classic.\n\nSouth Dakota's walleye is next level, so it's no surprise that the state is known for its walleye sandwiches. When the flaky fish is fried to perfection, it will melt in your mouth.\n\nSink your teeth into Elvis Presley's favorite sandwich, made with peanut butter, banana, and bacon. Just be careful — the mix of salty, sweet, and savory is highly addictive.\n\nBarbecue brisket is Texas's national dish, so try yours on some hardy, homemade bread with or without onions and bell peppers.\n\nWhen in Utah, it's perfectly acceptable to dig into a burger topped with a quarter-pound of thin-sliced pastrami.\n\n\"Pastrami burgers,\" which originated at Crown Burgers in Salt Lake City, are slathered with a Thousand Island-style sauce as well as tomatoes, shaved lettuce, and onions.\n\nThe \"Vermonter\" takes advantage of its state's freshest ingredients, like turkey, ham, Vermont cheddar cheese, green apples, and honey mustard.\n\nThere's almost nothing more classic than a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, and Virginia is known for its excellent cheeses and succulent ham.\n\nDue to its large Vietnamese community, Seattle is home to some of the best bánh mì sandwiches in America.\n\nThe inexpensive staple is usually made with pate, bright, crunchy vegetable slaw, fish sauce, and sliced jalapeño pepper or fresh cilantro.\n\nStop into Ben's Chili Bowl and order a chili half-smoke, a half-pork, half-beef smoked sausage served on a warm steamed bun with mustard, onions, and spicy homemade chili sauce.\n\nMake a delicious apple and turkey sandwich with West Virginia's Golden Delicious apples. Cheese and apples sound like a weird combo, but it's worth it.\n\nThis Midwestern state has a large German immigrant population, so it's no surprise that its most famous sandwich contains classic bratwurst. Eat the sausage roll topped with mustard, sauerkraut, and cheese curds — another thing for which Wisconsin is well-known.\n\nWide-open Wyoming is where the buffalo roam ... and occasionally appear on menus. Try a bison meatball sandwich when you're here to taste the state's most famous meat.",

    "description": "The closures are expected to significantly increase wait times, so travelers should budget extra time at the airport.",
    "fullText": "Federal officials said they suspended TSA PreCheck and Global Entry Sunday morning at 6 a.m. ET, but in many US airports, the lanes remained open past the deadline.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday night that it would shut down the expedited airport security and immigration lanes due to the partial government shutdown, which left the department without funding.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration, which operates PreCheck and is an agency of DHS, said it was evaluating the situation on \"a case-by-case basis.\"\n\n\"At this time, TSA PreCheck remains operational with no change for the traveling public,\" a TSA spokesperson said Saturday morning. \"As staffing constraints arise, TSA will evaluate on a case-by-case basis and adjust operations accordingly.\"\n\nLos Angeles International Airport said Saturday on social media that it was diverting all TSA PreCheck customers to general screening lanes. It later removed the post. San Francisco International Airport said on X that all TSA PreCheck and Global Entry \"remain operational.\"\n\nTravel chaos at airports is often an impetus to end government shutdowns. TSA and customs agents are considered essential employees and are working without pay during the partial shutdown, as they did for 43 days during the full shutdown in October.\n\nLast year's shutdown ended after air traffic controllers began to call out after several $0 paychecks. The 2019 shutdown ended soon after mass callouts temporarily halted travel in New York.\n\nSocial media posts showed that PreCheck lanes were still operating at major airports on Sunday, including Minneapolis, Washington, DC, and Orlando, hours after the 6 a.m. cutoff.\n\nThe injection of confusion comes on an already stressful travel weekend, with many flights canceled as the country prepares for a blizzard in parts of the Northeast. Airlines like JetBlue and Delta have preemptively said some flights in the region will be canceled and have offered travel waivers to affected flyers.\n\nTSA PreCheck allows approved travelers to keep shoes and jackets on and leave laptops and liquids in bags, while Global Entry provides expedited passport control when returning to the US from abroad.\n\nBoth programs are widely used by frequent flyers and business travelers and are designed to help agents handle more travelers more efficiently through facial recognition and automation. If the lanes close, wait times at airports could increase significantly.\n\nTSA PreCheck costs $76.75 per traveler for a five-year pass (renewals start at about $58); Global Entry, which includes PreCheck, costs $120. DHS said passengers with active memberships will be able to fly using standard security or immigration lines.\n\nCLEAR, a separate, privately run expedited checkpoint, appears to be operating.\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the agency is \"making tough but necessary workforce and resource decisions\" and prioritizing the \"general traveling population\" at airports.\n\n\"Without appropriations, TSA simply cannot afford to risk overstretching our staff and weakening our security posture,\" she added.\n\nThe lanes would reopen once the agency secures funding, DHS said.",

    "fullText": "Most critics of President Donald Trump view him as the ultimate threat to American democracy. But to Nobel prize-winning economist Daron Acemoglu, Trump’s merely a fever, the result of an infection that’s been brewing for years before he rode down the golden escalator to announce his presidency.\n\nThe MIT economist has spent decades studying the origins of economic and political decay, specializing in how institutions foster inclusive growth—or succumb to extractive systems. In the 2012 book Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Acemoglu and co-writer James A. Robinson argue that nations proper because of their political institutions. In 2024, Acemoglu won the Nobel Prize in economics, alongside Robinson and Simon Johnson, for demonstrating how political and economic institutions shape prosperity.\n\nHow do experts differ on AI's job impact?\n\nWhat is Acemoglu's 'pro-worker' AI development approach?\n\nWhy does Acemoglu view Trump as symptom, not cause?\n\nHow could AI-driven inequality threaten American democracy?\n\nAcemoglu argued that while Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are weakening the country’s institutions, the president is not the root cause of the broader structural problems. He warned the country is headed down a grim path and outlined two shifts relative to AI development he sees as critical to avoiding deeper decline: cracking down on economic inequality and tempering job destruction. “If we go down this path of destroying jobs [and] creating more inequality, U.S. democracy is not going to survive,” he told Fortune.\n\nOne: The proliferation of economic inequality\n\nAccording to Acemoglu, AI-driven job displacement could be catastrophic and further entrench inequality. He notes the U.S. is currently seeing unprecedented levels of wealth inequality, and traditional policy has failed to close the gap. “We may need wealth taxes because anything else we do today is still going to lead to this huge wealth gap that exists in this country.”\n\nThe economist pointed to California’s proposed “billionaire tax,” a ballot initiative which would impose a one-time 5% wealth tax on all individuals in the state with a net worth of $1 billion or more. But even that doesn’t go far enough, according to the economist. “It’s not enough to tax the rich,” he said. “You really need ways in which workers of all sorts of skills can take part in the growth process.”\n\nBut AI proponents say Acemoglu’s diagnosis of AI development is counterintuitive. Adam Thierer, senior fellow at the think tank R Street Institute and longtime advocate for technological innovation, believes AI will spawn opportunities, driving the economy into the future. “The way we get new and better jobs and opportunities is through technological improvements in society and our economy,” Thierer told Fortune.",

    "description": "In a study of 2,000-year-old skulls from Vietnam, archaeologists discovered that iron was the primary component that dyed teeth black.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nGleaming black teeth have been considered a high standard of beauty in parts of Vietnam since at least the late 1800s. But now, archaeologists have traced this practice back 2,000 years, discovering that ancient people used their abundant iron resources to dye their pearly whites black.\n\nIn a study published Jan. 22 in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, researchers investigated skeletons from Dong Xa, an archaeological site in the Red River delta of northern Vietnam. The settlement at Dong Xa was occupied during the Iron Age (550 B.C. to A.D. 50), and the cemetery held numerous skeletons with unique dental colors. To figure out how people discolored their teeth thousands of years ago, the researchers nondestructively analyzed the skeletons' enamel using a variety of techniques.\n\nWhen they targeted the colored areas of dental enamel using X-ray fluorescence, which measures the X-rays emitted by a sample to characterize its chemical composition, they found a high concentration of iron oxide, the researchers wrote in the study. Then, they used scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS). This technique involves bombarding a sample with electrons, which produces X-rays characteristic of the chemical elements in the sample. The researchers found that the discolored ancient enamel samples from Dong Xa were positive for iron (Fe) and sulfur (S).\n\n\"We believe that the combined presence of Fe and S signals is a strong indicator of the involvement of iron salts,\" study lead author Yue Zhang, an archaeologist at the Australian National University, told Live Science in an email. Nowadays, botanical materials are also used as part of the process to blacken teeth, so it's likely that finding traces of these on ancient teeth may also signify the practice, Zhang added.\n\nOne modern method of blackening teeth involves the combination of an iron-based substance with a tannin-rich plant material, such as betel nuts (Areca catechu). Betel-nut chewing has been popular for thousands of years among peoples of the Pacific and Southeast Asia, and prolonged use of the natural stimulant can stain a person's teeth and gums red or reddish-brown. But when tannic acids and iron salts are combined and exposed to air, they create a dark-black color.\n\nBased on information from modern populations that blacken their teeth, the researchers suspect that the ancient blackening process likely took several days or weeks of application of an iron-tannin mixture to achieve the intensely dark shade. But once the process was completed, the person's teeth remained black throughout their lifetime, with touch-ups needed every few years to preserve their luster.\n\n\"The practice is still observed today, not only in Vietnam, but also more widely across parts of Southeast Asia,\" Zhang said.\n\nWhile the precise procedures for tooth blackening likely changed over time, the underlying mechanism responsible for the dark coloration — the interaction between tannic acid and iron salt — was likely the same, according to the researchers. This means the presence of iron salt and sulfur on ancient teeth can be considered a diagnostic marker of purposeful blackening, they wrote.\n\n\"To our knowledge, our research on the Dong Xa teeth is the first to connect archaeologically discovered blackened teeth with modern intentional tooth-blackening practices,\" Zhang said.\n\nBut there are still unsolved questions surrounding why the practice of tooth blackening arose.\n\n—7-year-old Maya child had green jade 'tooth gem,' new study finds\n\n—17th-century Frenchwoman's 'innovative' gold dental work was likely torturous to her teeth\n\n—Ancient people in Taiwan yanked healthy teeth from their mouths for 'aesthetic expression' and 'tests of courage,' study finds\n\nOne possibility is that blackening was developed as a less-extreme version of tooth ablation, a practice that involves removing otherwise-healthy teeth as a rite of passage or as a group identification marker, the researchers noted. Another possibility is that blackening was invented to enhance the visual impact of the staining that resulted from betel-nut chewing.\n\nRegardless of the original purpose, the researchers wrote, \"tooth blackening plausibly became widespread around the Iron Age, when iron utensils became more accessible for producing blackening dye paste.\"",

    "title": "The Surprising Skill MAGA Christians Say Is 'Sinful'",
    "description": "As Christian nationalism rises, some influential voices are reframing this ability as weakness, manipulation or even a threat to faith.",
    "fullText": "If asked to name examples of sins, most people would probably not mention “empathy.” But in recent years, attacks on empathy have moved from fringe talking points into mainstream right-wing Christian discourse.\n\nConservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey released a book in 2024 titled “Toxic Empathy.” The following year brought the release of “The Sin of Empathy” by right-wing theologian Joe Rigney. Shortly thereafter, billionaire Elon Musk declared on Joe Rogan’s podcast that “the fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy.”\n\nLife: ‘Vertical Morality’ Might Describe Why MAGA Christians Seem So Unchristian\n\nEmpathy is typically defined as the ability to understand and share the feelings and perspectives of other people. It’s a skill that many Christians have long seen as aligning with the teachings and example of Jesus Christ.\n\nBut proponents of the “toxic empathy” critique now argue that empathy can cloud moral judgment or be manipulated to advance policies they see as unbiblical. That shifting view on empathy in this era of “MAGA Christianity” concerns many religious scholars and advocates.\n\n“In the last several years, especially within MAGA-aligned Christian spaces, I’ve watched empathy get rebranded as weakness,” said Malynda Hale, executive director of the Christian nonprofit The New Evangelicals. “In choosing to care about the lived experiences of others ― whether they are immigrants, LGBTQ people, Black communities, anyone outside the white evangelicals’ space and ideological lane ― people are framed as being ‘too emotional,’ ‘unbiblical,’ or even ‘compromising your faith.’”\n\nThe rise of Christian nationalism has seen empathy demonized as “sinful,”“dangerous,” “weak,” and even a tool of liberal manipulation. Calls for compassion toward marginalized groups are increasingly met with defensiveness or hostility.\n\nWith the popularity of books like those mentioned above “driving this blatant move away from Christ’s message of radical love, justice and preferential treatment of the oppressed, MAGA Christians are able to sit comfortably in their bigotry as their neighbors are kidnapped and murdered in the streets,” said Bible scholar Mattie Mae Motl.\n\nMotl believes the vilification stems in part from the fact that empathy promotes a kind of compassion that cannot be controlled or commodified by profit-driven economic systems.\n\n“I first noticed empathy specifically demonized during the 2024 election, but it’s just a repackaging of a phrase that was popular when I was a conservative Christian: ‘love the sinner, hate the sin.’ This phrase has also been weaponized to keep Christians from being too loving,” said April Ajoy, author of “Star-Spangled Jesus: Leaving Christian Nationalism and Finding A True Faith.”\n\nLife: Trump's 'Disrespectful' Tribute To Jesse Jackson Exposed A Stunning Hypocrisy, Experts Say\n\nShe recalled learning this framework with regard to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n“It gives justification to Christian parents to abandon their queer kids without feeling guilty,” Ajoy said. “It also gives other Christians permission to bully LGBTQ people and work to take their rights away in the name of ‘tough love.’ But hate wrapped in piety is still hate.”\n\nIn today’s political climate ― particularly amid horrifying news surrounding immigration enforcement ― critics say the anti-empathy rhetoric represents a sharp departure from Christianity’s New Testament foundation.\n\n“Christianity is a faith built on compassion for the other,” Motl said. “It is the heart of Christ’s message. The greatest commandment, according to Jesus, is that we ‘love our neighbor as ourselves.’ Without empathy, we are only able to love the neighbor who looks, thinks and believes like us.”\n\nLife: Hilary Duff Shares Emotional Confession About Her Sister — Experts Say This Choice Can Be Healthy\n\nShe pointed to the parable of the Good Samaritan, in which Jesus demonstrates what neighborly love looks like using the example of a Samaritan.\n\n“Samaritans were a people group historically despised and rejected among the Jewish communities that Jesus grew up in,” Motl said. “The message is clear: you are to love and fight for your neighbor, even when they look, think or believe differently than you.”\n\nScripture also describes Jesus as empathetic. Motl quoted Hebrews 4:15: “For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses.”\n\n“The Bible shows us that Christ’s work of salvation would be nothing without his divine and ultimate work of empathy,” she said. “This empathy was not neutral or passive. Instead, Christ’s empathy got him executed by the state ― not unlike Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good. Christ-like empathy comes at a cost, and this is not a cost that MAGA Christians are willing to pay.”\n\nLife: The 30-Second Hack You Should Be Using In The Shower, According To A Doctor\n\nAjoy sees the doctrine of the Incarnation as another reflection of Christianity as a “fundamentally empathetic theology.”\n\n“In Jesus Christ, God enters into human vulnerability and suffering,” she said. “The Gospels repeatedly depict Jesus as emotionally responsive to the pain of others, most notably in John 11:35 ― ‘Jesus wept.’ Romans 12:15, which commands believers to ‘rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep,’ further underscores empathy as a normative Christian practice.”\n\nShe highlighted Jesus as a figure who stood with the outcast, not with the oppressors.\n\nHale recalls empathy being at the center of the Christian faith in which she was raised.\n\nLife: 'Bare Beating' Is 'Unequivocally Rude' But Extremely Common\n\n“I think specifically growing up in the Black church, that message of empathy was a core message because our understanding of Jesus’ words [was] to care for the marginalized and to understand the struggles of others,” she said. “That’s literally the foundation of what Jesus taught. And because so many outside factors in the United States affected the Black community differently, the church was always a place where you could go for that love and compassion.”\n\n“It’s so alarming to see so many MAGA Christians demonizing empathy today,” Ajoy said. “Empathy is frequently depicted as a moral liability that threatens political loyalty. If they can get their followers to believe it’s toxic to care about immigrant families being ripped apart, then it’s easier to continue cheering on the administration they claim came from God.”\n\nShe believes the far right Christian movement is targeting empathy as a defense mechanism.\n\n“They have no excuse for supporting the inhumane treatment of our immigrant neighbors while claiming to follow a Christ who said, ‘I was a stranger and you did not welcome me ... and what you do to the least of these, you do to me,’” Ajoy explained. “So, they deflect instead.”\n\nCalling empathy spiritually “dangerous” is a way to keep congregants tied to this MAGA Christian ideology.\n\n“It trains regular churchgoers to keep their distance from those outside their small community,” Ajoy said. “If you never meet a trans person, it’s easier to believe all trans people are evil. Because it’s really hard to demonize someone when you’re close enough to see their humanity. And once the ‘other’ is humanized, a decent person would condemn their inhumane treatment. ‘Toxic empathy’ keeps well-meaning Christians from loving the neighbors Jesus called us to love.”\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nHale echoed that white Christian nationalists generally cannot relate to the marginalized communities impacted by the current administration. So they feel more comfortable fearing and/or judging them.\n\n“Because empathy requires you to see beyond your own experience, it forces you to acknowledge others have been hurt, reconsider your beliefs and sometimes confront the fact that your community has been on the wrong side of a lot of things,” she said. “That’s uncomfortable. And it’s also realizing that maybe they are clinging to the construct of whiteness and the protection it typically brings more than they are to a faith system.”\n\nEmpathy disrupts the MAGA movement’s clean narrative of hierarchy, identity and certainty. Rather than engage with discomfort or challenge certain beliefs and systems, it demonizes empathy.\n\n“If a MAGA Christian witnesses something painful, like a child torn away from their parents, for example, or a woman bleeding out in a parking lot because of a change in abortive healthcare laws, they could be moved with compassion to soften their hard stance on ‘the rules’ according to the law,” said Tia Levings, a former Christian fundamentalist and author of “A Well-Trained Wife: My Escape from Christian Patriarchy.”\n\n“They might vote differently, pay more attention to real outcomes or feel motivated to advocate for the weak or innocent,” she added.\n\nPeople in power in extreme religions need rigid rules and static positions to maintain power and order, so they warn against the “danger” of compassion, flexibility and nuance.\n\n“Framing empathy as a sin introduces shame and fear ― two powerful motivators and manipulations in high-control religion,” Levings said. “If a pastor or teacher can make someone afraid they’ll sin against God and go to a literal hell to burn for eternity if they allow themselves to be moved with compassion and take action to relieve someone’s pain, that person is more likely to put their blinders on and hope the pain isn’t happening.”\n\nThus, branding empathy as toxic serves both an ideological function and an institutional one by protecting existing power structures.\n\n“MAGA-aligned pastors and influencers have their livelihoods on the line,” Ajoy said. “If they admitted they were wrong about Trump or started condemning his administration, they’d lose their pulpits, platforms and community. These pastors told their congregants that Trump was God’s chosen, influencers told their followers Christians had to vote for him. And as Trump’s administration continues to enact policies that are in direct conflict with Jesus’ teachings, MAGA Christians are left with a choice: Admit they were wrong or manipulate the narrative.”\n\nThe changing views on empathy both reflect and stem from what Levings sees as a major theological shift in evangelical churches and seminaries from 2000 onward.\n\n“Scripturally, it’s Jesus who fulfills compassion and empathy, moving the hard lines of Old Testament law to soften into the fruits of the spirit ― love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, gentleness, kindness, faithfulness and self-control,” she said. “But when churches and seminaries moved towards reformed theology and Calvinist doctrine, that came with a return to Old Testament law.”\n\nShe pointed to fundamentalists like Doug Wilson and John MacArthur, who were influential in shaping congregations to view empathy as weakness. It’s all part of theonomy ― the belief that Old Testament biblical law, including its judicial and penal codes, should be applied to modern society and civil government.\n\n“Jesus is too liberal, too socialist, too forgiving,” Levings said. “Most importantly, Jesus’s compassion is at odds with the political power sought by the religious right. They prefer the ten commandments, harsh sentences, vanquishing so-called enemies and a militaristic stance in their culture war against science, progress and growth.”\n\nThe idea is that God is rigid and static. “Faith is holding a line, not feeling moved to comfort pain or see someone’s humanity,” Levings added.\n\n“Discouraging empathy leads to apathy, which leads to the approval of inhumane horrors,” Ajoy said. “Moral blindness is the direct result of discouraging empathy. We see this today in the unwavering loyalty MAGA Christians have extended to Trump, whose policies frequently stand in direct contradiction to the teachings of Jesus.”\n\nRather than stand with the marginalized, adherents of MAGA Christianity seem to have chosen to align with the powerful.\n\n“As empathy is suppressed, emotional callousness is reframed as moral strength, and bigotry is reinterpreted as faithfulness,” Ajoy said. “Within Christian communities, condemning empathy distorts the character of God, severing divine justice from divine compassion. It also undermines the command to love our neighbor, where people become issues to solve instead of humans to love.”\n\nPrioritizing self-interest and the interest of any specific political movement over compassion, love and decency risks us losing our humanity.\n\n“Empathy is not optional in a faith that claims to be centered on love,” Hale said. “Love requires understanding and humility. Love requires stepping into someone else’s perspective, even when it’s uncomfortable. The more people choose to villainize empathy, the more risk losing the opportunity to live in a just compassionate world.”\n\nThat kind of loss is evident in today’s news headlines and the cognitive dissonance in how so many people respond to them.\n\n“People are looking away and ignoring current events to avoid feeling moved,” Levings said. “They’re insisting they ‘aren’t political’ to avoid being engaged citizens. They’re ‘hardening their hearts,’ defiant and unfeeling. They’re reframing what it means to be called ‘Christian’ because their platform has so little to do with Jesus and what it means to follow Christ’s example.”\n\nThe real-world consequences are serious and even deadly at times.\n\n“Sufferers can not count on the Christian community to relieve their suffering, because they’re obeying a dictator rather than living like Christ and seeking to relieve suffering,” Levings added. “Another consequence is that democracy is weakened, and our religious freedoms are stripped as we move into a Christian theocracy that has claimed to punish, suppress, legislate, imprison and vanquish those who don’t agree with them.”\n\nMuch of the anti-empathy rhetoric aims to control women. Levings observed that when federal immigration officers detained a preschooler and allegedly used him as “bait” to capture his family members, some of the most outraged and vocal critics were mothers.\n\n“The Christian patriarchy views empathy and compassion as feminine weaknesses, and less masculine, making this part of the overall gender distinction they claim makes men and women different from one another,” Levings said. “Women as a voting bloc also endanger the patriarchy’s grip on political power. This press against empathy runs parallel to other attempts to marginalize women’s power, such as repealing the 19th Amendment, removing women from professional roles and programs and changing divorce laws so that we can’t leave marriages.”\n\nMany of the theologians who spoke to HuffPost highlight the tenet that humans are made in God’s image and Christians are called to imitate Christ, who treated the poor, marginalized and oppressed with dignity and worth.\n\n“Be wary of those flaunting their Christianity instead of living it out,” Ajoy said.\n\nShe pointed to the worship services at the White House, Oval Office prayer sessions and loud declarations that religion and Christianity are “back” as “showy demonstrations of faith without caring for the poor, the widow, the orphan, the immigrant, the single parent, etc.” As the Bible notes, “faith without works” is not true faith.\n\n“These are an example of the religious hypocrites Jesus condemned in Matthew 15 ― ‘These people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me,’” Ajoy said. “It appears to me that if MAGA Christians lived in Bible times, they would say Jesus had toxic empathy when he healed people without health care, when he fed people who didn’t earn it or when he forgave and loved the adulterous woman instead of judging her. To have empathy is holy, not toxic.”\n\nThe original version of this story was published on HuffPost at an earlier date.\n\nWhat Drives MAGA Christians' Un-Christian Actions?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump oddly posted a video of CNN’s Kaitlan Collins — the woman he has dubbed “the worst reporter” — discussing the enormous new banner bearing his visage that she claimed has “erased” the line between the White House and the Department of Justice.\n\nWork crews used a cherry picker to erect the banner over the entrance to the Department of Justice on Thursday.\n\n“It’s almost impossible to miss the the new banner bearing President Trump’s face that just went up here at the Justice Department,” Collins said. “If you’ve been in Washington in recent months you’ve seen similar ones at the Department of Labor or the Department of Agriculture for example, but this one seems to strike a different chord given it’s the Department of Justice.”\n\n“Historically, administrations have tried to stress a level of independence between the West Wing and the White House and their Justice Department, arguing that politics doesn’t influence who is being prosecuted,” Collins continued. “But it’s safe to say that line has been erased since President Trump has taken office in his second term. We’ve seen him directly pressure the Attorney General to prosecute people who he perceives as his political enemies, or people who have led prosecutions against him. The Justice Department said this banner is in honor of America’s upcoming 250th birthday celebration, but if you look at this banner closely, it also echoes what President Trump himself has said, talking about the slogan, ‘Make America Safe Again.'”\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Collins “the worst reporter” who never smiles, after she asked a question about the victims of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhen Collins asked, “What would you say to the survivors–” Trump interrupted.\n\n“You are so bad, you know? You are the worst reporter. No wonder CNN has no ratings, because of people like you. You know, she’s a young woman. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile. I’ve known you for 10 years. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a smile on your face–”\n\nWatch the video on Truth Social here.\n\nThe post Trump Oddly Posts Video of CNN Rival Kaitlan Collins Claiming His Giant Banner at the DOJ Symbolizes ‘Erased’ Separation of Powers first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "When I visited Paris for the first time in 2022 during my inaugural solo trip, I fell in love with the city instantly.\n\nSipping my chocolat chaud while reading Hemingway's \"A Moveable Feast\" at the legendary Café de Flore, enveloped in the charming Haussmannian architecture the city is renowned for, I whispered to myself: \"I could live here.\"\n\nIt wasn't until two years later that I would finally make the move abroad after being accepted into a graduate school program and subsequently quitting my dream job at a big-time magazine to fulfill my newest dream of living in Paris.\n\nAlthough moving to France from the US has come with plenty of benefits, such as a slower pace of living and a healthier work-life balance, one part of my journey has significantly suffered: my love life.\n\nFor a city that markets itself as the City of Love, I have found building a meaningful connection with someone in Paris nearly impossible.\n\nAs someone with an intermediate level of French, I knew when entering the Parisian dating scene that language would be a hurdle, especially when going on dates with non-native English speakers.\n\nDuring dates with people who didn't feel comfortable speaking English or didn't speak the language very well, we'd mostly converse in French — I found banter to be difficult and less fluid.\n\nMy personality also took a hit. Instead of my usual, flirty self, I felt more reserved because I couldn't express myself fully in my third language.\n\nEven during dates where the other person did have a good command of English, I felt as though we lacked a certain access to one another as we weren't able to express ourselves in our mother tongues.\n\nAs a result, I convinced myself our connection would never reach deeper than center ground.\n\nAnother barrier to finding love while dating in Paris has been the differing dating customs.\n\nIn my experience, it's not uncommon for French partners to want to go on regular romantic dates and engage in public displays of affection, like holding hands, even if we're only seeing each other casually.\n\nAs someone who is used to clearly defined relationship boundaries and labels, like \"friends with benefits\" and \"exclusive,\" while dating in the US, I find it a bit disorienting to receive forms of intimacy usually reserved for a serious relationship from a non-romantic partner.\n\nI have also observed that the \"what are we?\" conversation is not really common in France. After a few successful dates, it's often assumed that you and your dating partner are exclusive. In comparison, in the US, a conversation around exclusivity usually precedes becoming \"official\" with someone.\n\nThe lack of a clear conversation around labels has often left me feeling confused about where I stand with potential partners or the relationship feeling unbalanced.\n\nWhile I can't say my dating experience was that much better when I was living in the US, I do consider moving back home to New York to increase my chances of finding a meaningful partnership.\n\nIn my experience, there are many benefits to dating in your native country — from speaking the same language to upholding similar dating rules and customs, and, oftentimes, having shared experiences that can only be witnessed by someone from your hometown.\n\nAt the same time, some of the most beautiful love stories defy cultural and language barriers. I would be remiss not to try to work past the difficult parts of dating abroad in my search for a partner who makes my heart flutter long past the honeymoon stage.\n\nNevertheless, while concurrently navigating a seemingly never-ending dating pool, I have also been enjoying my alone time in this fairy-tale city.\n\nIn her essay, \"Why Are All the Lonely Girls Going to Paris?,\" writer Jenna Ryu argues that perhaps inhabiting this so-called City of Love is not about finding a storybook romance, but celebrating the beauty of solitude, especially as a young, single woman.\n\nI have never felt more sure of myself and in love with life than during these past two years living in Paris. The love I would often reserve for a romantic partner, I have been pouring onto myself — and that has made all the difference.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has demanded that Netflix remove former US ambassador and national security advisor Susan Rice from its board, stepping up his criticism of the streaming giant as it seeks to merge with Warner Bros. Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning with Trump. Speaking on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast published Thursday, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and skirt the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\n\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction,\" and these companies are \"going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice said.\" They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nRice, a Democrat, has a long career in US foreign and domestic policy, working under Democratic presidents.\n\nShe served in the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001, including roles at the National Security Council and as assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.\n\nUnder Obama, Rice served as US ambassador to the UN, becoming the second-youngest person at 44 and the first Black woman to represent the US at the UN. She later served as head of the Domestic Policy Council under Biden.\n\nShe was born in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Stanford with a degree in history. She worked in management consulting for McKinsey and Company before entering government.\n\nRice has previously faced criticism from the right. In her 2019 memoir, \"Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For,\" she wrote that she was a frequent \"villain\" for conservative media.\n\nAfter the 2012 killing of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, Republicans accused her of misleading the public in interviews discussing the attacks. She was later cleared by subsequent investigations.\n\nShe also faced scrutiny by Trump and his allies for \"unmasking\" senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York in 2016.\n\nUnmasking is when senior government officials ask to learn the identity of a US citizen whose name has been withheld in intelligence reports about communications, such as intercepted calls. In some situations, national security officials argue that knowing the person's identity is necessary to interpret and assess the intelligence information.\n\nAs UN Ambassador, Rice supported US intervention against Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nRice has written op-eds supportive of the Biden administration and accusing Trump of undermining democracy. In a 2025 column in The New York Times, Rice accused members of Trump's national security team of \"reckless negligence\" after they discussed sensitive national security matters on Signal.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

Rice made comments about corporations that \"take a knee to Trump,\" saying they could face retribution under a subsequent Democratic administration.\n\nAfter right-wing activist Laura Loomer posted about Rice's comments, Trump responded: \"Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.

    "fullText": "We got the news days before Valentine’s Day this year that the teen heartthrob of millennials everywhere, actor James Van Der Beek (star of hits like Dawson’s Creek and Varsity Blues), had died of colorectal cancer at age 48. It hit hard, not just because he was my first on-screen love, but because I also have stage 3 cancer at an abnormally young age (I was diagnosed at 37). When I found out he had six kids he left behind, my heart broke even more. I have five of my own. But the similarities didn’t stop there.\n\nVan Der Beek and I both missed a very real and important symptom that prolonged our cancer diagnoses, one that oncologists are shouting from the rooftops that more young people should watch for. Just like a colonoscopy, it’s not sexy, but so important to keep an eye on—changes in bowel movements. Here’s what to know about this early colon cancer sign.\n\nColorectal cancers, meaning cancer that develops in the soft tissue of the digestive system, such as the colon or rectum, are on the rise in young people. One in 24 men and one in 26 women will develop this condition, which is now the third most diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of cancer death, the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) warns. What’s more concerning is that every year since the mid 1990s, there’s been a two percent increase in cases diagnosed in the 20 to 39 age group, CRI shares, with experts blaming processed food and red meat, along with sedentary lifestyles.\n\n“By 2030, cases in younger adults are expected to nearly double. By the end of the decade, about 1 in 10 colon cancers and 1 in 4 rectal cancers will occur in people under 50,” says Avni Desai, MD, gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Commack, NY. “We don’t fully understand why this is happening. Researchers are looking at possible links to diet, lifestyle and environmental factors, and this trend is being seen worldwide.”\n\nColon Cancer Screening: Would You Get Tested Before 50?\n\nMost young people aren’t analyzing their poop on a regular basis. After all, it's, well, gross. When I first had changes in bowel habits, I blamed my diet. I figured I needed to skip Friday night pizza and drinks with my friends, and that maybe I’d become a bit lactose intolerant. So, I played with my diet a bit and wrote it off. In 2024, Van Der Beek had a similar thought, blaming coffee.\n\nHe originally told People: “It was just a change in bowel habits…I probably need to change my diet a little bit. Maybe I need to stop coffee. Maybe I need to not put cream in the coffee. And then when I finally took that out of the diet and it didn’t improve, and I thought, all right, I better go get this checked out.”\n\nSimilarly, I did get a bit more worried when the diarrhea didn’t stop with eliminating dairy. Plus, I was missing my Friday night friends' outing. I didn’t really get it checked out until it became emergent-level stomach pain that sent me to the ER—one that revealed a large tumor in my digestive tract, despite having no family history of cancer.\n\nSo why don’t we pay attention to our bodies even as “aware” people? Kids. Life. Jobs. Denial. Whatever the reason, it’s not good enough to stop the colorectal cancer problem early.\n\n“We see this all the time,” Dr. Desai says. “Many people assume bowel changes are due to something they ate, stress or a new medication. Rectal bleeding is often blamed on hemorrhoids, even if it’s been going on for months or longer.” She says that, unfortunately, both young people and their healthcare providers often don’t suspect colorectal cancer, delaying diagnosis as well.\n\nVan Der Beek was the picture of health, in “amazing cardiovascular shape,” along with taking cold plunges, practicing intermittent fasting, “all of it,” he once shared. Similarly, I was someone who ate healthy, worked out frequently and never suspected an issue. And for those without symptoms, there’d be no reason to suspect colon cancer, and no routine screening as a young person to be sure.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends colorectal cancer screenings starting at age 45, lowered from age 50 in 2018, either via a stool-based test or a colonoscopy (the “gold standard” colon cancer screening tool). Though the lower testing age won’t help with rises in diagnosis in young people in their 20s and 30s, Dr. Desai says that overall, the majority of cases are still in older adults.\n\nBut if you can get screened for colorectal cancer, do it. As someone who has now had many colonoscopies, I can assure anyone who is considering getting one that it’s really not that bad at all, and strangely, the best nap ever. So just do it.\n\nAs Van Der Beek would likely attest to, don’t assume it’s coffee causing bowel changes. As I can attest, don’t assume you’ve developed a lactose problem. Instead, if you have a bowel change, carefully track what’s happening, for how long and pay extra attention. “If bowel changes or bleeding last more than a few weeks—especially if they don’t improve with simple diet changes—it’s time to check in with a healthcare provider,” Dr. Desai says.\n\nShe also says to watch for early signs and symptoms of colon cancer, including:\n\nUnfortunately, this type of cancer also might not cause symptoms at all, she adds. (Learn more about colon cancer symptoms in women that you should never ignore.)\n\nOne Woman’s Breast Cancer Story That’s Inspiring Women Everywhere (EXCL)\n\n“The good news is that when colorectal cancer is caught early, it’s highly treatable and often curable,” Dr. Desai reassures. “Screening saves lives. The most important step is simply to get screened and not to ignore symptoms if something doesn’t feel right.”\n\nLuckily, today, I have a much better prognosis, with the cancer removed and frequent screening ensuring it didn’t spread further. But the lesson I learned is one I’ll carry with me as I wait many more years, hopeful of remission, shouting from the rooftops to not ignore your poop habits.

    "fullText": "From a purely data-based standpoint, the stock market has been practically unstoppable with Donald Trump in the White House. Although there have been periods of historic volatility, such as the five-week COVID-19 crash in February-March 2020, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and technology-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively, during Trump's first term.\n\nThe stock market's outperformance has continued since President Trump's second, non-consecutive term began on Jan. 20, 2025, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq climbing by 14%, 15%, and 16%, respectively, as of the closing bell on Feb. 18, 2026.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nThis Trump bull market has been fueled by an assortment of factors, such as the rise of artificial intelligence and the advent of quantum computing, as well as policies and proposals directly linked to Trump.\n\nFor example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Trump's flagship tax and spending law from his first term) permanently lowered the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the lowest level since 1939. With businesses keeping more of their income, it's led to record share buybacks from S&P 500 companies -- more than $1 trillion estimated for 2025. Share repurchases can increase earnings per share for public companies with steady or growing net income.\n\nAlthough the Trump bull market may appear infallible, several headwinds are threatening to pull the rug out from beneath it. While some of these catalysts are well known, such as tariff-related uncertainty and historically high stock valuations, the eventual undoing of the Trump bull market may be a surprise culprit: the Federal Reserve.\n\nNormally, the Federal Reserve is Wall Street's financial bedrock. It's America's foremost financial institution tasked with maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. It achieves these goals by adjusting the federal funds target rate -- the overnight lending rate between financial institutions -- and/or conducting open-market operations, such as buying or selling U.S. Treasury bonds. It's a straightforward task guided by copious amounts of economic data.",

    "fullText": "Cristiano Ronaldo says he is happy at Al-Nassr following doubts over his future at the Saudi Arabian club.\n\nThe 41-year-old Portuguese had reportedly been unhappy with how the club were being run by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and missed three recent games.\n\nHe returned last week and after scoring twice in Saturday's 4-0 win over Al-Hazem, which sent his side one point clear at the top of the Saudi Pro League, insisted he wanted to stay.\n\n\"I'm very happy,\" the Portugal international told Saudi broadcaster Thmanyah. \"As I say so many times, I belong to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"It's a country that has welcomed me very well, and my family and my friends. I'm happy here, I want to continue here.\n\n\"The most important thing is we keep pushing [for the league title], we are there at the top. We do our job, we win, make pressure, let's see at the end of the season.\"\n\nRonaldo moved to the Middle East in December 2022, shortly after his contract with Manchester United was terminated by mutual agreement, becoming the best-paid player in football history with an annual salary of £177m.\n\nBut since his arrival, the 10-time league champions have only won the 2023 Arab Club Champions Cup.\n\nSaturday's win saw them move one point ahead of Al-Hilal and they are also into the quarter-finals of the AFC Asian Cup.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) is set to face an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) with a vote of no confidence to be held in chair Richard Collier-Keywood.\n\nAn exact date has yet to be set but the WRU has seven weeks to stage the event.\n\nHowever it is likely to be held in late March or early April, after the Six Nations.\n\nDemands for an EGM were led by the Central Glamorgan Rugby Union (CGRU) district - within the Ospreys region - who wrote to clubs in January.\n\nThe WRU previously described the prospect of an EGM as an \"irresponsible first nuclear option\" which would cause \"significant damage\" to Welsh rugby.\n\nThe district has said it now has the 10% support - about 30 of the near-300 clubs across Wales - required to force the motion.\n\nIn a letter seen by the BBC dated 22 February, CGRU honorary secretary Derek Davies said the district has \"submitted the requisition\" for an EGM to the WRU.\n\nThe date, time and location will be confirmed by the WRU Board.\n\nThe WRU has confirmed it has received a requisition from the community clubs and outlined the next steps.\n\nThe WRU must verify the requisition to ensure it is fully compliant with the process in our Constitution and Articles of Association.\n\nWithin 21 days of receipt of a requisition by sufficient member clubs the WRU must give notice of the proposed date of the EGM.\n\nOnce notice is given, the EGM itself must be held within 28 days.\n\nSo it could be a maximum of seven weeks from 22 February but is unlikely to take that long.\n\nThis will be a fourth EGM in 12 years with the previous annual general meeting (AGM) being held at the end of November 2025.\n\nCentral Glamorgan has not given an exact figure of clubs who have backed the proposals but thanked \"the substantial number of member clubs who have also given their support without the paperwork\".\n\n'Heartbreaking, sad, disgrace' – Wales fans react to state of game\n\nSwansea Council seeks high court injunction against WRU\n\nWRU brands calls for EGM an 'irresponsible nuclear option'\n\nThree motions were initially tabled in January and will be debated at the EGM.\n\nThe first is a vote of no confidence in WRU chair Collier-Keywood and Professional Rugby Board (PRB) chair Malcolm Wall, which would require a majority of more than 50% of the clubs that attend the EGM to pass.\n\nThe second motion would be for the WRU council to hold elections for the four elected member board position within 14 days after the EGM, which also requires more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThe third motion was to amend how the WRU district and council members are elected, which will require a 75% majority.\n\nIn addition to the motions, CGRU also put forward the following recommendations:\n\nAn immediate hold on plans to amend the structure of the professional game, with a full review of WRU finances and organisation structure to be undertaken to identify where money can be saved (executive and board salaries, consultants) to support the professional, SRC and community game in Wales.\n\nA rugby steering group to be set up within three weeks comprising of people from the professional, SRC and community game along with business sector. This group will be directed to advise on rugby related matters and negate the need for expensive consultants.\n\nA central national academy to be set up within three months to be totally responsible for the identification and development of talent for male and female players.\n\nExcept for the WRU chief executive, chair and the Professional Rugby Board (PRB) chair, no directors (independent non-executive or WRU council members) should be paid.\n\nThe new WRU chair and PRB chair appointments should be immersed in Welsh culture, have a strong understanding of Welsh rugby and values, ideally be conversant in the Welsh language and live in Wales.\n\nThe EGM news comes at a time of turmoil for Welsh rugby off the field.\n\nSwansea Council has applied for a High Court injunction to halt the proposed deal between the WRU and Ospreys owners Y11 Sport and Media to buy rivals Cardiff.\n\nOspreys are under threat of being removed from the professional tier with owners Y11 the WRU's preferred bidders to buy Cardiff from the governing body.\n\nThe WRU wants to cut one professional men's side in Wales with Ospreys now in the firing line if Y11 buy Cardiff.\n\nThe WRU has told Swansea Council a deal will not be completed with Y11 before 16 March.\n\nOn the field, Wales, who have lost the opening three games against France, England and Scotland, finish their Six Nations campaign against Italy in Cardiff on Saturday 14 March after travelling to face Ireland in Dublin eight days before.\n\nThe WRU statement continued: \"The WRU published its plans for the future of the elite game in Wales at the end of October 2025, following an extensive consultation process.\n\n\"We are now focused on rolling out that plan and have been working tirelessly with the key stakeholders during the last months to agree a consensus on its implementation.\n\n\"This detailed work has been undertaken with the professional clubs, the United Rugby Championship and player representatives, and we remain committed to reaching consensus on the next steps.\n\n\"We ask all stakeholders to continue working with us. We recognise that change is challenging, but it is essential for the long-term health of the game in Wales.\"",

The governing body could also hand out its own separate punishments.\n\nTwo Pakistan internationals - Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim - appeared in last year's tournament, which was the final edition before new investors took control.\n\nMore than 60 Pakistan players were among the 964 to \n\nThis week, teams will submit a list of players of interest, which will whittle down the overall options to a longlist of less than 200 players who will go to the auction.\n\n67 Pakistan players \n'A shame' if Pakistan players excluded from Hundred\n\nIPL-linked teams 'not considering Pakistan players'",

Jos Buttler made a tortured seven from 14 balls, Jacob Bethell fell to a wild slog and Tom Banton ran himself out.\n\nPhil Salt's 62 and 21 from Jacks, who was the next highest scorer in a fine all-round display, were crucial.\n\nEngland play Pakistan on Tuesday and New Zealand on Friday in their remaining Super 8s matches.\n\nOne win should be enough to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nSalt and Jacks dragged England to a score but Sri Lanka still appeared favourites at halfway.\n\nThough England defended 128 on this ground in a series before the World Cup, Sri Lanka chased 182 with two overs to spare to beat Australia here in the group stage.\n\nThis surface was trickier than that one. Its sticky nature and decent turn offered assistance to the spinners and Jacks capitalised.\n\nAfter conceding four from an accurate first over, Jacks got one to grip to take the leading edge of Mendis. Rathnayake charged him a ball later and was caught skying a hideous swipe.\n\nBrook also used Archer for three consecutive overs at the start.\n\nArcher bowled at high pace and had Nissanka, who scored a brilliant hundred against Australia, caught at deep square leg before finding the edge of Mishara.\n\nHemantha's dismissal – he hit his stumps with his bat flapping at Jamie Overton – summed up a poor Sri Lanka batting display, not that England will care.\n\nAfter nervy wins over Nepal, Scotland and Italy in the group stage, they are closing in on a place in the last four.\n\nStill we wait for England's batting to truly fire at this tournament.\n\nWith his feet stuck and best form seeming distant, Buttler missed three deliveries and toe-ended another before being pinned in front by Wellalage's left-arm spin on the reverse sweep.\n\nOnly 37 runs came from the powerplay, with Bethell caught at short third trying to hit Maheesh Theekshana over mid-wicket.\n\nAs the pressure to score rose, Banton took on a single that was never there and Brook was trapped tentatively on the crease for 14.\n\nThe highest partnership of the match was 26 between Salt and Sam Curran. Battling cramp from the ninth over, Salt did not find top gear and Curran holed out at long-on\n\nJacks targeted the off side smartly and struck four important fours and Overton clubbed a six in the last over.\n\nThere remains room for improvement but England's tactic of favouring batting depth - Jacks was at number seven and Overton nine here – is proving to be smart as the top order struggles.\n\nT20 World Cup: England complete convincing win over Sri Lanka - as it happened\n\nTMS podcast: Bowlers bail out England as they beat Sri Lanka\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry?

    "fullText": "Holders Chelsea edged past Manchester United into the FA Cup quarter-finals thanks to an extra-time tap-in from defender Naomi Girma.\n\nThe United States international prodded home from close range in the 99th minute to open her goal account for the Blues after the visitors had failed to clear their lines from a corner.\n\nIt was a disappointing end to the tie for Marc Skinner's side, who had battled from behind to take the contest into extra-time.\n\nSubstitute Simi Awujo arrived at the back post on 81 minutes to cancel out Sam Kerr's opener - the Australian had come off the bench to steer home Veerle Buurman's knockdown three minutes prior.\n\nChelsea had beaten United in last season's final and victory will hand Sonia Bompastor's side a psychological edge over the Red Devils before they meet again in the League Cup final at Ashton Gate on 15 March.\n\nElsewhere, captain Kim Little scored for a second FA Cup tie in a row as 14-time winners Arsenal claimed a 3-0 victory over Bristol City.\n\nVictoria Pelova and Frida Maanum were also on target in a second half that was blighted by a head injury to winger Olivia Smith, who was stretchered off.\n\nManchester City are also through after ruthlessly despatching second-tier Sheffield United 4-0.\n\nThe Women's Super League leaders raced into a three-goal lead inside 22 minutes thanks to two close-range finishes from Lauren Hemp, and a low drive from Aoba Fujino. Laura Coombs poked home their fourth in the 90th minute.\n\nBrighton ran out 2-1 winners at West Ham in another all-WSL tie, as manager Dario Vidosic returned to the dugout.\n\nThe 38-year-old has been away from the team in Australia for the past month after the passing of his father Rado, who was also Brighton's women's and girls' head of coaching.\n\nVeteran Fran Kirby rolled back the years with a goal and assist in a commanding first-half display, with Leila Wandeler's 75th-minute goal unable to inspire a West Ham fightback.\n\nBirmingham City and Charlton Athletic prevailed in the only ties not involving top-flight clubs.\n\nOceane Hurtre scored a hat-trick in an 8-0 rout for the Blues over Chatham Town on Friday night, while the Addicks edged out fourth-tier Oxford thanks to Lucy Fitzgerald's 76th-minute penalty.\n\nLondon City Lionesses host capital neighbours Tottenham on Monday, 23 February (19:30 GMT) in the remaining fifth-round tie.\n\nCharlton and Birmingham lead the race for promotion to the Women's Super League next season, but they may get an early taste of life among the top tier in the next round of the FA Cup.\n\nProviding they don't draw each other, they will take on top-flight opponents next.\n\nIt offers a chance to gauge their level against the best, with holders Chelsea, European champions Arsenal and current WSL leaders Manchester City still in the competition.\n\nWith the WSL expanding to 14 teams for 2026-27, the top two teams in WSL 2 will earn automatic promotion at the end of the current campaign.\n\nIn top spot and unbeaten in their 16 league games to date (11 wins, five draws), Charlton are clear favourites to win the title.\n\nThey have a nine-point lead over second-placed Birmingham, who are one clear above Crystal Palace in the promotion play-off place.\n\nThe Blues will be looking to go one better this time around after being pipped to promotion by London City Lionesses on the final day of last season.\n\nWhile only a brief glimpse, a one-off cup tie will provide an insight into how much more there is to do if they fulfil their promotion dream.\n\nBirmingham City 8-0 Chatham Town\n\nChelsea 2-1 Manchester United (AET)\n\nManchester City 4-0 Sheffield United\n\nOxford United 0-1 Charlton Athletic\n\nLiverpool v Everton (22 February, 16:30 GMT)\n\nLondon City Lionesses v Tottenham Hotspur (23 February, 19:30 GMT)\n\nThe draw for the quarter-finals will take place on Monday, 23 February at 19:00 GMT on TNT Sports 1 and the Adobe Women's FA Cup YouTube channel.\n\nThe last-eight ties are scheduled to take place on Sunday, 5 April.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "Mixing friendship and money matters always has its risks.",
    "fullText": "Co-signing a student loan might feel like a short-term favor, but for many people it becomes a long-term financial risk. According to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz, more than 90% of private student loans require a co-signer, meaning two people are equally responsible for the debt.\n\n“A co-signer is often required for a private student loan because the student borrower has a thin or non-existent credit history,” Kantrowitz told CNBC (1). “They are an unproven asset.”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nRobert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’\n\nThat obligation doesn’t go away until the loan is repaid, and it doesn’t matter who benefited from the loan.\n\nImagine Jessica, a 28-year-old who agreed to co-sign her friend’s private student loans when she was 22 years old. At the time, she was newly on her own and trying to help someone she trusted. Her friend needed a co-signer to finish her degree and promised to stay current on payments. She also told Jessica she’d refinance the loan as soon as she could. For years, everything seemed fine.\n\nBut Jessica recently learned the loan is several months past due and her friend has stopped paying — and stopped responding to her messages. The lender has begun calling Jessica directly, warning that they will soon report the late payments to the credit bureaus.\n\nTaking over the loan payments could undo years of work Jessica has put in digging herself out of credit card debt, but letting it default could damage her credit. What can she do to remain financially healthy?\n\nJessica’s situation illustrates a risk millions of Americans take, often without fully understanding the consequences. Private student loans are especially risky for co-signers because they lack many of the protections built into federal loans. There are typically no income-driven repayment plans and few forgiveness options. Even when co-signer release programs exist, they are rarely granted, and generally require the main borrower’s approval (2).\n\n“Lenders are generally averse to removing a cosigner,” Dean Kaplan, president of The Kaplan Group, told U.S. News.\n\n“If they let the cosigner off and then the borrower defaults, the lender is facing a greater financial loss than if they had not released the cosigner (2).”",

    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses what went wrong in England's record home defeat by Ireland and what areas could be improved for the final two rounds.\n\nRemember two years ago when England were going to get beaten at home by 40 points against Ireland?\n\nThe narrative in this tournament rarely plays out as expected. Teams overperform and sides crack under pressure. That is the beauty of the Six Nations.\n\nThat predicted thumping in 2024 never happened. Instead, England stunned Grand Slam-chasing Ireland with the last play of the game to win 23-22.\n\nRoll on two years, when expectations were much lower, and Ireland delivered that record away win.\n\nAndy Farrell's side arrived with the mentality to deliver a historic victory, bringing the tactics and accuracy needed to win.\n\nThe 21-point difference at Allianz Stadium came down to tactics and decision-making. England made a load of mistakes, and some of that came down to trying to play the match like a game of chess.\n\nThe issue with doing that is that they could not change on the hoof how they wanted to play.\n\nThe tactical battle between coaches Andy Farrell and Steve Borthwick was won by Farrell, but England need players on the field who are able to change tactics as they go.\n\nThey have struggled with sticking to the script instructed to them by Borthwick, with any changes then being delivered at half-time.\n\nGiven the talent and winning run, I was expecting England to adapt better.\n\nWhy do teams play with a high tempo against them? Because England are good.\n\nIt looked like they thought another team could not replicate Scotland's attacking play from last week.\n\nIt was very unlike England, but that is what happens when you get stressed.\n\nThey lacked the senior Lions mentality to get out of sticky situations. Over the last two weeks, where were those decision-makers?\n\nThe defence and attack needed adjusting in the first quarter. They waited 40 minutes and had conceded 22 points.\n\nEngland have good leadership, but Maro Itoje - who will only get better with more minutes under his belt - cannot do it all on his own.\n\nHe wants the leaders around him to step up in their roles, especially given he is not finishing games at the moment.\n\nSomeone like Ollie Chessum can jump in with an idea of how to fix the line-out. Freddie Steward, who can see the flow of the game from the back, could offer input on where the space to attack is.\n\nThe squad has not changed from the 12-game winning run. They are a group of very good rugby players.\n\nEllis Genge was honest and brave in his assessment, but I do not feel let down by England.\n\nThey are capable of winning in Rome and Paris.\n\nThe loss should not be the reason for a load of changes for the Italy game, as Borthwick's continuity in selection is what brought success.\n\nDespite a rest week coming, a three-game block of games is very taxing and England have the depth available.\n\nI would freshen up the half-backs and bring in Fin Smith and Jack van Poortvliet.\n\nAlex Mitchell's injury may open that door for Van Poortvliet, but I want to give a new opportunity to key decision-makers in an away Six Nations game.\n\nSmith is a confident player and, having been England's starting 10 in last year's Six Nations, he will want to prove his ability to adapt in-game.\n\nFull-back George Furbank is another intelligent player who can spot space in attack, and I want to see him as he will also be chomping at the bit to prove his worth.\n\nI would then go Tom Roebuck and Henry Arundell on the wings. A free-flowing game in Rome suits their attacking attributes.\n\nThe back row, too, I felt lacked some balance against Ireland.\n\nBringing Henry Pollock and all his energy off the bench is a play that I would go back to.\n\nA new outlook and perspective from players who have been outside the pressure cooker may well bring long-term benefits.\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nIs Borthwick under pressure after nightmare defeat?\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\nRuthless Ireland beat England, & Scotland come back in Cardiff\n\nNow the narrative is that they did not win big away games in 2025. They beat what was in front of them, and they have proved themselves to be a good side.\n\nLike a good golfer, they are tinkering that bit too much. That has enormous ramifications.\n\nThe progress up until the Scotland game was good enough for a World Cup, but they are trying lots of different things that they do not need at the moment.\n\nOff the back of a tough 2024, England used being the underdog to their advantage.\n\nThey won in Argentina with a young squad and beat New Zealand in November. It becomes trickier when you are known to be one of the top sides.\n\nEngland were getting into that bracket as they blew Wales away, and the rest of the Six Nations knew they were going to have to come up with something superhuman to beat them.\n\nThat is exactly what has happened, and Borthwick's side must deal better with higher expectations.\n\nThe pressure is also different, as every breath for the past month has been about the Six Nations and possibly winning it. That is draining and tiring.\n\nFinding the energy as an underdog to play above yourself is easier than finding that spark within yourself when you are expected to win.\n\nEvery single year you will get these types of results, and that will not change.\n\nIt is not out of the question that England go to Paris and beat France. What is the narrative then?\n\nNothing said Ireland could win against them by 20-odd points - and it happened.",

I confess to using both of these programs, but I’ve noticed that, well, it’s as if they’re trying to please, with statements like “You’re absolutely right, Jeff,” and “That’s pretty much right.” Often, when I ask, “Would you mind thinking for a bit longer on that?”, I then get another response saying: “Jeff, you’re absolutely right, again, to query that result. It turns out I was a bit hasty in my reply …”\n\nIf the world runs even more on information filleted out from the sump of the internet by LLMs, what are the consequences? Can we look forward to a future in which AI is more concerned with appearing sympathetic (getting good reviews?) than being factual? Er, a bit too human?

The Scotland winger intercepted a pass and caught the ball off his foot before it hit the ground to race in unopposed. The video referee took a long look at the handling but ruled the try was good.\n\nWhen Jake Trueman put Kiwi back-row Seth Nikotemo in for Wakefield's fourth try just after the hour it looked like they were in the clear.\n\nHowever, two tries in rapid succession from Flanagan pulled them right back into the contest.\n\nThe Giants, two points down, had eight minutes to pull the game out of the fire but Wakefield, with Max Jowitt outstanding in defence, kept them at bay to close out the win.\n\nHuddersfield: Flanagan; Carr, Gagai, Milne, Halsall; Lolohea, Russell; Patolo, Woolford, Rogers, O'Donnell, Hewitt, Powell.\n\nInterchanges: Burgess, King, Rush, Cozza.\n\nWakefield: Jowitt; Pratt, Scott, Hall, Walmsley; Trueman, Sinfield; McMeeken, Smoothy, Hamlin-Uele, Nikotemo, Vagana, Pitts.\n\nInterchanges: Rodwell, Storton, Tevaga, Smith.",

    "description": "Sheffield Wednesday are the first EFL club to go down in February - here is how a season to forget unfolded.",
    "fullText": "Sheffield Wednesday have been relegated from the Championship with 13 games to play.\n\nThe administration-hit side were deducted 18 points this season, and their inevitable relegation was confirmed with a defeat at city rivals Sheffield United on Sunday, which left them on -7 points, 41 adrift of safety with just 39 to play for.\n\nIt is the earliest relegation in the history of the English Football League.\n\nA large number of the senior squad were sold or released in a chaotic summer marked by then owner Dejphon Chansiri's failure to pay wages on time, which left the club under numerous embargoes.\n\nAdministration inevitably followed in October, and Wednesday's depleted squad, further weakened by January exits, have struggled to compete, with one win all season and now 10 successive league defeats.\n\nA preferred bidder for the club was announced in December but, as yet, the takeover has not been completed.\n\nWednesday's only win of the campaign came in September and it looks possible they will become the first team in Football League history to end a campaign on minus points.\n\nSheff Wed relegated after Steel City derby defeat\n\nProtests against Thai businessman Chansiri's ownership had increased last season, a campaign which marked 10 years since he took over at Hillsborough.\n\nPlayers and staff had their wages for March delayed and then went unpaid again in May.\n\nIt proved to be the start of the end for Chansiri and for Wednesday's Championship hopes.\n\nAs the initial delay in paying wages wore on, and with no comment from the owner, the club were hit with registration embargoes and the Professional Footballers' Association called the situation \"shocking\".\n\nPopular boss Danny Rohl initially refused to return to the club when pre-season began before briefly returning.\n\nIn the meantime, players Josh Windass and Michael Smith both left on free transfers with their contracts ended by mutual consent.\n\nRohl quit at the end of July on the same day Sheffield Council announced it had not given the ground's North Stand a safety certificate for the forthcoming campaign.\n\nHenrik Pedersen, Rohl's assistant, was appointed boss and captain Barry Bannan signed a new one-year deal, but the club's chaotic summer lurched onwards as the players refused to play a training match at Burnley.\n\nThat was their final planned pre-season game and so they went into the new campaign having not played a single friendly in front of a crowd.\n\nFans protested before their first game of the season at Leicester City, a game where Bannan was sent off as the Owls eventually fell to a battling 2-1 defeat.\n\nThe North Stand received its safety certificate in time for the first home game of the season against Stoke City the following week. Supporter protests continued, with some holding a mock funeral for the club in nearby Hillsborough park before the match, which the Owls lost 3-0.\n\nThe home EFL Cup ties against Leeds United and Grimsby Town were both boycotted by the vast majority of fans as they tried to stop any additional money going into the club as part of the protests to get Chansiri out. The penalty shootout success, after a 1-1 draw, over Premier League side Leeds in the second round provided a rare moment of joy.\n\nSeptember then brought the high point of the league season as they claimed a deserved 2-0 win at Portsmouth but the club moved no closer to a takeover.\n\nChansiri's reign was brought to an end on 24 October when the club was placed into administration and docked 12 points by the EFL.\n\nFans who had been boycotting matches and the club shop returned in droves for the following day's 2-1 home defeat by Oxford United, and the club celebrated the end of Chansiri's spell with a video on the big screen pre-match, while seats spelling out his name in the briefly condemned North Stand were removed.\n\nThe influx of cash meant the club's administrators Begbies Traynor were able to pay October's wages early, and by 10 November, proof of funds to buy the club had been provided by 10 interested parties.\n\nThe club were given a six-point deduction on 1 December for the late payment of wages under Chansiri and payments owed to His Majesty's Revenue and Customs.\n\nThis left the Owls 27 points adrift of safety but it did at least mean the club should start next season in League One without the threat of further deductions.\n\nThe administrators announced they had selected a preferred bidder on 24 December, with BBC Sport reporting former professional poker player James Bord had been chosen.\n\nThe team last avoided defeat on 29 December when they played out a goalless draw with fellow strugglers Blackburn Rovers.\n\nBannan's 10-year spell with the club came to an end in January when he left for Millwall, while young striker Bailey Cadamarteri was sold to Wrexham.\n\nThe administrators announced at the start of this month the club had enough money to operate through to the end of the season.\n\nWith relegation now confirmed, fans will be hoping positive news about the takeover will follow soon.\n\nLatest Sheffield Wednesday news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Sheffield Wednesday content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is curious as to why Iran has not yet \"capitulated\" and agreed to curb its nuclear programme, as Washington builds up its military capability ‌in the Middle East, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said.\n\n\"I don't want to use the ‌word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use ​the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated,\" Witkoff said during an interview on Saturday with Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump,\" hosted by the president's daughter-in-law.\n\n\"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's ‌what we're prepared to do'? And ⁠yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place.\"\n\nTrump has ordered a huge buildup of forces in the Middle East and preparations for a potential multi-week ⁠air attack on Iran. Iran has threatened to strike U.S. bases if it is attacked.\n\nIRAN DENIES SEEKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\nThe United States wants Iran to give up enriched uranium which Washington says can potentially be used to make a ​bomb, as ​well as stop supporting militants in the Middle East ​and accept limits to its missile programme.\n\nTehran ‌says its nuclear programme is peaceful but it is willing to accept some curbs on it in return for the lifting of financial sanctions. It rejects tying this to other issues such as missiles and support for armed groups.\n\n\"They've been enriching well beyond the number that you need for civil nuclear. It's up to 60% (fissile purity),\" Witkoff said. \"They're probably a week away from having industrial, industrial-grade bomb-making material, and that's really ‌dangerous.\"\n\nA senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Iran ​and the United States still have differing views over sanctions relief ​in talks.\n\nWitkoff also said he has met ​at Trump's direction with Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, son of the shah ousted ‌in Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He did ​not provide further details of ​the meeting.\n\nPahlavi, who lives in exile, served as a rallying figure for some of Iran's opposition during anti-government demonstrations last month in which thousands of people are believed to have been killed, ​the worst domestic unrest since the ‌revolution era.\n\nEarlier in February, Pahlavi said U.S. military intervention in Iran could save lives, and ​urged Washington not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran's clerical rulers on a nuclear ​deal.",

    "title": "The U.S. spent $30 billion to ditch textbooks for laptops and tablets: The result is the first generation less cognitively capable than their parents",
    "description": "Neuroscientist Jared Cooney Horvath said older generations “screwed up” giving students access to so much technology: “I genuinely hope Gen Z quickly figures that out and gets mad.”",
    "fullText": "In 2002, Maine became the first state to implement a statewide laptop program to some grade levels. Then-Governor Angus King saw the program as a way to put the internet at the fingertips of more children, who would be able to immerse themselves in information.\n\nKing’s initial efforts have been mirrored across the country. In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $30 billion putting laptops and tablets in school. But more than a quarter century and numerous evolving models of technology later, psychologists and learning experts see a different outcome than the one King intended. Rather than empowering the generation with access to more knowledge, the technology had the opposite effect.\n\nEarlier this year, in written testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, neuroscientist Jared Cooney Horvath said that Gen Z is less cognitively capable than previous generations, despite its unprecedented access to technology. He said Gen Z is the first generation in modern history to score lower on standardized tests than the previous one.\n\nWhile skills measured by these tests, like literacy and numeracy, aren’t always indicative of intelligence, they are a reflection of cognitive capability, which Horvath said has been on the decline over the last decade or so.\n\nCiting Program for International Student Assessment data taken from 15-year-olds across the world and other standardized tests, Horvath noted not only dipping test scores, but also a stark correlation in scores and time spent on computers in school, such that more screen time was related to worse scores. He blamed students having unfettered access to technology that atrophied rather than bolstered learning capabilities. The introduction of the iPhone in 2007 also didn’t help.\n\n“This is not a debate about rejecting technology,” Horvath wrote. “It is a question of aligning educational tools with how human learning actually works. Evidence indicates that indiscriminate digital expansion has weakened learning environments rather than strengthened them.”\n\nThe writing was perhaps already on the wall. Fortune reported in 2017 that Maine’s public school test scores had not improved in the 15 years the state had implemented its technology initiative. Then-Governor Paul LePage called the program a “massive failure,” even as the state poured money into contracts with Apple.\n\nGen Z will now have to face the ramifications of eroding learning capabilities. The generation has already been hit hard by the transformations of the 21st century’s other technological revolution: generative AI.\n\nEarly data from a first-of-its-kind Stanford University study published last year found AI advancements to have “significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the U.S. labor market.” But a less capable population means more than just poorer job prospects and less promotions, Horvath warned; it endangers how humans are able to overcome existential challenges in the decades to come.\n\n“We’re facing challenges more complex and far-reaching than any in human history—from overpopulation to evolving diseases to moral drift,” he told Fortune. “Now, more than ever, we need a generation able to grapple with nuance, hold multiple truths in tension, and creatively tackle problems that are stumping the greatest adult minds of today.”\n\nClassroom technology usage has ballooned in recent years. A 2021 EdWeek Research Center poll of 846 teachers found 55% said they are spending one to four hours per day with educational tech. Another quarter reported using the digital tools five hours per day.\n\nWhile teachers may be intending for these tools to be strictly educational, students often have different ideas. According to a 2014 study, which surveyed and observed 3,000 university students, students engaged in off-task activities on their computers nearly two-thirds of the time.\n\nHorvath blamed this tendency to get off-track as a key contributor to technology hindering learning. When one’s attention is interrupted, it takes time to refocus. Task-switching also is associated with weaker memory formation and greater rates of error. Grappling with a challenging singular subject matter is hard, Horvath said. For the best learning to happen, it’s supposed to be.\n\n“Unfortunately, ease has never been a defining characteristic of learning,” he said. “Learning is effortful, difficult, and oftentimes uncomfortable. But it’s the friction that makes learning deep and transferable into the future.”\n\nSustained attention to a singular subject is anathema to how technology today has been deployed, argues Jean Twenge, San Diego State University psychology professor studying generational differences and the author of 10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World. More time on screens isn’t just ineffective in facilitating learnings; it’s counterproductive.\n\n“Many apps, including social media and gaming apps, are designed to be addictive,” Twenge told Fortune. “Their business model is based on users spending the most time possible on the apps, and checking back as frequently as possible.”\n\nA Baylor University-led study published in November 2025 uncovered why this is: TikTok required the least amount of effort to use, even less than Instagram Reels and YouTube shorts, by balancing relevant videos with surprising and unexpected content.\n\nConcerns over social media addiction have become so dire that 1,600 plaintiffs, across 350 families and 250 school districts, filed a lawsuit alleging Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube created addictive platforms leading to mental health challenges like depression and self-harm in children.\n\nHorvath proposed a swath of solutions to Gen Z’s tech problem, at least as it pertains to classroom use. Congress, he suggested, could impose efficacy standards to fund research on what digital tools are actually effective in the classroom. The legislature could also require strong limits on tracking behavior, building profiles, and collecting data on minors using tech.\n\nSome schools have taken matters into their own hands. As of August 2025, 17 states have cracked down on cellphone use in school, banning the technology during instructional time; and 35 states have laws limiting the use of phones in the classroom. In fact, more than 75% of schools have said they have policies prohibiting cellphone use for non-academic purposes, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, though enforcing those bans have been met with variable success.\n\nUltimately, Horvath said, the loss of critical thinking and learning skills is less of a personal failure and more of a policy one, calling the generation of Americans educated with gadgets victims of a failed pedagogical experiment.\n\n“Whenever I work with teenagers I tell them, ‘This is not your fault. None of you asked to be sat in front of a computer for your entire K-12 schooling,’” Horvath said. “That means we…screwed up—and I genuinely hope Gen Z quickly figures that out and gets mad.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

We're pumped for the bowling crew, they've been working hard. The partnership [between Miller and Brevis] steadied the ship and kept us in the game. We looked at where we could run hard and our batting in the middle was the difference.\n\n\"We're going to have to enjoy this but park it and get our minds sharp [to face West Indies]. We don't want to take confidence and good vibes for granted.\"\n\nIndia captain Suryakumar Yadav: \"You can't win the game in the powerplay, but you can lose it. We lost too many wickets in the powerplay.\n\n\"Hopefully we bat well, bowl well and field well [against Zimbabwe]. I hope we play the same brand of cricket, nothing changes.\"\n\nTest Match Special commentator Prakash Wakankar: \"You see the satisfaction but also the steely determination on the faces of the South Africa players. Right from the toss, there wasn't the customary smile from Markram, who was very serious and focused.\n\n\"The disappointment from the captain after getting out really said a lot. It clearly shows that South Africa came here with a plan and executed it with ruthlessness to deliver a result that will be very, very well received by their supporters.\"\n\nT20 World Cup: South Africa complete impressive win over India - as it happened\n\nHow South Africa conquered Test cricket in 2025\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Will Jacks, labeled England's 'Jack of all trades' by Harry Brook, delivers again at the T20 World Cup to keep the winter of a lifetime rolling on.",
    "fullText": "Will Jacks has already had quite the winter.\n\nHe made his Ashes debut in Australia, got engaged to his partner Ana in Sydney and now, at times single-handedly, is taking England towards the T20 World Cup semi-finals.\n\nWhich would he rank as his best moment?\n\n\"That is not for me to answer,\" laughed his captain Harry Brook.\n\n\"But he has had three man-of-the-match awards this World Cup and I don't think he has played his best cricket yet.\"\n\nBrook and Jacks go back a long way.\n\nThey were 15-year-olds when they played against each other at the famous Bunbury Festival – Jacks playing for the London schools' side and Brook the north of England.\n\nJacks made 46. Brook took two wickets.\n\nFour years later they were roommates with the Under-19s and now Jacks is keeping Brook's first World Cup campaign as captain afloat.\n\nWhen this tournament began with questions around Brook's suitability to be captain after off-field controversy in Wellington, it was Jacks who was put forward to speak to the media to defend his mate.\n\nAgainst Nepal, the right-hander hit 39 not out, without which England would have suffered one of the great World Cup shocks, and his first T20 fifty against Italy, a powerful 53 not out, pushed a tight game out of the reach of the Italians in their valiant chase.\n\nHis 21 with the bat and three wickets with the ball against Sri Lanka was another gift for Brook, coming on the captain's 27th birthday.\n\nEngland now sit one win from a World Cup semi-final.\n\n\"He is a very competitive lad,\" said Brook. \"He was annoyed when he got out tonight.\n\n\"After his first over he said 'I always bowl better when I am annoyed'. That was one of the reasons I kept him on.\n\n\"He is that perfect player. He is the Jack of all trades who can do everything.\"\n\nJacks' Ashes was not all fairytale proposals below Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nOff the field, he was one of the England players plastered across the front page of the Australian newspapers with a pint in hand in Noosa.\n\nOn it, he struggled with his two wickets in the third Test against Australia in Adelaide costing 212 runs. Across the series he took six wickets for 394 runs.\n\nJacks' stubborn batting in Australia did show a side of his game that hinted at promise and now he is thriving as England's T20 man for all seasons.\n\nBacked by Brook on Sunday he was asked to open the bowling for England for the first time since a match against Australia in Barbados at the last T20 World Cup.\n\nThat day, after what Jos Buttler later described as a \"gut feel\", Aussie opener Travis Head – the man who cut and pulled him into submission in Adelaide – sent him onto the Kensington Oval roof in an over that cost 22 runs. England's campaign never recovered.\n\nThis time his opening over cost only four, even that a boundary courtesy of a misfield.\n\nBrook said it was a \"last-minute\" decision to give Jacks the new ball, the logic being that with a shorter boundary to the left-handed Kamil Mishara's leg side it was better to have Jacks' off-spin turning the ball away.\n\nTypically, after that good first over, Jacks dismissed two right-handers in his next – the dangerous Kusal Mendis poking and chipping back a catch and Pavan Rathnayake charging and slicing a catch high to the off-side ring.\n\n\"Rathnayake's been a very good player for them, and probably their best player of spin - the way that he runs down the pitch,\" Brook said.\n\n\"To get him out first ball was a very crucial part in the game for us.\"\n\nControl was something often lacking with Jacks' off-spin during the winter but here he delivered his most accurate spell.\n\nBowling four overs on the spin, he pitched 91% of his deliveries on the stumps or in the channel - the highest of any England match of his career.\n\nHis only bad ball, one which slipped from his sweaty hand, was pulled for six by Dasun Shanaka but later Jacks got his revenge by being the initial catcher in a brilliant relay grab with Tom Banton.\n\nIf his first three wickets put England on course for victory, the dismissal of Shanaka confirmed it.\n\n\"I love getting the responsibility with the ball,\" Jacks said.\n\n\"It encourages me to get into the game and perform better.\n\n\"[Opening the bowling] is not foreign for me. And with a surface like that, I come in knowing what to do.\"\n\nJacks has been given the nickname of Slim Shady by some England players during this tournament – a reference to his pre-tournament haircut and bleached blond hair. In the dressing room he has even been asked to rap.\n\nBrook appears happy with his Jack of all trades. He is keeping this winter rolling on.\n\nEngland bowlers secure crucial win over Sri Lanka\n\nMen's T20 World Cup tables, top run-scorers & wicket-takers\n\nStats battle: Can you beat our new T20 World Cup game?",

    "fullText": "Tries: Bielle-Biarrey, Meafou, Ramos, Drean, Gailleton Cons: Ramos 4\n\nFrance recorded a bonus-point win against a spirited Italy in Lille to maintain their bid for a Six Nations Grand Slam and back-to-back titles.\n\nLes Bleus raced into a 19-0 lead through tries by Louis Bielle-Biarrey, Emmanuel Meafou and Thomas Ramos, who was a late switch at fly-half after Matthieu Jalibert was ruled out of the game.\n\nDespite the early dominance on the scoreboard, Italy remained competitive and responded by an Ange Capuozzo try and a Paolo Garbisi penalty.\n\nWith Louis Lynagh in the sin-bin, debutant Gael Drean grabbed the vital bonus-point try and Emilien Gailleton crossed in a less eventful second half.\n\nThe visitors have only beaten France twice in the Six Nations, with the 2024 game ending in a thrilling draw in Lille.\n\nFrance, who lost only one game in last year's championship, next travel to Edinburgh to face Scotland on Saturday, 7 March, while Italy host England on the same day.\n\nGiven Galthie's side's strength at home, where they will play England in the final game, the next match could define their Grand Slam hopes.\n\n\"I think we always believed we would get the bonus-point win,\" Meafou told ITV.\n\n\"We knew Italy were a strong team, they hung in for 80 minutes, they never cracked and they never let go.\n\n\"Our goal is to take out the Six Nations game by game but the end goal is the 2027 World Cup so we keep working towards that.\"\n\nBack-to-back heavy defeats for Steve Borthwick's side will also help build Italy's confidence of recording a first win over England.\n\nGonzalo Quesada's side defeated Scotland in the opening round and ran out of steam to compete in the second half against Les Bleus.\n\nFrance's slick attacking play blew away Ireland and Wales in the opening two rounds to emphatically begin their pursuit of a first Grand Slam since 2022.\n\nFlash tries had the visitors on the back foot early as Antoine Dupont's kick through found flyer Bielle-Biarrey for him to score in a record eighth successive Six Nations game.\n\nFollowing Meafou's finish from close range, Gailleton's clean break came out of nothing to help set-up Ramos' try.\n\nTwo years ago in Lille, the hosts learnt the hard way to not overlook an improving Italy side as Paolo Garbisi's injury-time penalty hit the post to deny them a first Six Nations victory in France.\n\nItaly, who pushed Ireland close in Dublin last week, stayed calm in the chaos and should have had one more than one first-half try that was scored by Capuozzo.\n\nDespite fading in the second half, Quesada's side's scrum - like in Dublin - was a real weapon in the game to win penalties.\n\nCentres Tommaso Menoncello and Leonardo Marin both looked threatening and could cause England's defence, which has been struggling, problems.\n\n\"The scoreboard is always the truth of the game and we have to go with that,\" Italy captain Michele Lamaro told ITV.\n\n\"France were unbelievably good at taking their opportunities, especially in the first half.\n\n\"We couldn't build pressure in the second half and that took us to 70 minutes when we got the yellow card.\"\n\nThe hosts had to work hard for the important fourth try but were never in danger of a shock defeat.\n\nAnything other than a Grand Slam now would feel like a failure for what is a great French side.\n\nFrance: Attissogbe; Drean, Gailleton, Brau-Boirie, Bielle-Biarrey; Ramos, Dupont (capt); Gros, Marchand, Aldegheri, Flament, Meafou, Cros, Jegou, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Mauvaka, Neti, Colombe, Ollivon, Guillard, Nouchi, Serin, Barassi.\n\nItaly: Fischetti; Lynagh, Menoncello, Marin; Ioane; P Garbisi, Fusco; Fischetti, Nicotera, Ferrari, N Cannone, Zambonin, Lamaro (capt), Zuliani, L Cannone.\n\nReplacements: Dimcheff, Spagnolo, Zilocchi, Ruzza, Favretto, Odiase, Garbisi, Odogwu.\n\nAssistant Referees: Luke Pearce (Eng) and Eoghan Cross (Ire)",

    "description": "Three golds, a record-equalling medal haul - the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics has been one to remember for Team GB.",
    "fullText": "If someone had told you 16 days ago that Team GB would win three gold medals at the Winter Olympics, would you have believed it?\n\nTonight, flagbearers Matt Weston and Charlotte Bankes will lead Team GB into the closing ceremony in Verona as the curtains are drawn on a historic Games for the nation.\n\nIn winning five medals, GB has equalled its record best from both 2014 and 2018.\n\nBut it has been the nation's most successful Winter Olympics since the moment snowboarders Bankes and Huw Nightingale won the second of those golds in the mixed team snowboard cross.\n\nNever before had Great Britain won more than one gold medal at a Winter Olympics. That fact has now been buried deep in the snow.\n\nWeston kick-started the golden rush, withstanding the heavy pressure on his shoulders to win the men's skeleton title that was always his to lose.\n\nOn what has come to be known as 'Super Sunday', Bankes and Nightingale won Team GB's first Olympic gold medal on snow, a victory that was followed just a few hours later by Weston and Tabby Stoecker's mixed team success at the Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nOn the penultimate night of competition, the men's curling team - skipped by Bruce Mouat - won their second successive Olympic silver, before freestyle skier Zoe Atkin wrapped up Team GB's Games the next day with bronze in the halfpipe.\n\n\"These Games have been amazing, and a history-making Games,\" Team GB chef de mission Eve Muirhead told BBC Sport.\n\n\"This Games has really proven that we are capable, that we have so much potential, and we're growing. We're a growing winter nation, which is really exciting.\n\n\"With the French Alps [Winter Olympics] in four years time, this is a catalyst to those Games.\"\n\nWeird and wonderful stories from the Winter Olympics\n\nBut for all the medals, there were all the near-misses.\n\nIn total, there were five fourth-place finishes, some of which were by the most narrow of margins.\n\nTake freestyle skier Kirsty Muir, for example. Just 0.41 of a point was the difference between bronze and fourth place in the slopestyle.\n\nHad she not squatted on a landing on her final run, she would have made the podium.\n\nAgonisingly, she then recorded another fourth in the big air.\n\nSnowboarder Mia Brookes, meanwhile, knew she needed to go huge on her final big air run for a chance of a medal - and so she did.\n\nShe landed a competition-first backside 1620 trick - featuring four-and-a-half rotations - but over-rotated at the very last moment.\n\nHad she landed it cleanly, she would have won a medal.\n\n\"Fourths make champions,\" GB Snowsport chief executive Vicky Gosling told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We are fourth in the world. Kirsty's from Aberdeen, she started on the dry slopes. Mia started on the dry slopes in Manchester and then look where they've got to. We should be utterly proud of what we've achieved here.\"\n\nAround the Games, there were plenty of other performances that may not have brought home a medal, but were record-breaking in their own right.\n\nIn cross-country skiing, Andrew Musgrave and James Clugnet recorded a fifth-place finish in the team sprint event, the nation's best Olympic result in the sport.\n\nThat bettered Musgrave's sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle, while Anna Pryce recorded a best British women's result at an Olympics with her 32nd place in the sprint classic.\n\nStoecker, Freya Tarbit and Amelia Coltman all finished in the top 10 of the women's skeleton, while there were more than 20 top-10 finishes in total.\n\n\"I think because of the depth and breadth across so many sports and disciplines, it shows that we are not a one-trick pony,\" said UK Sport's director of performance Kate Baker.\n\n\"We're mixing it with the very best in winter sport. I think we can be really excited about what we've achieved.\"\n\nTeam GB will fly home on Monday, after which the post-Games reviews will begin, by both the British Olympic Association and the individual sports themselves.\n\nOver the four-year cycle leading into the Milan-Cortina Games, UK Sport ploughed £25.5m into winter sports on the Olympic programme, up from £22.2m for the Beijing 2022 cycle.\n\nThe funding for the next cycle, leading up to the 2030 Games, will be confirmed and announced in the summer, though the individual sports have already received a provisional figure for planning purposes.\n\nBut while an important metric, funding isn't just based on the number of medals won, or a reward for it. UK Sport also looks at future potential, as well as the impact and resonance on the watching British public.\n\nBaker told BBC Sport Team GB's athletes had gone \"above and beyond\" in delivering value for money, and asked how that success is now built on, she said: \"The reality is we've been thinking about it for the past four years. Already the work is in place to build for that next Games and indeed the one after.\n\n\"We've got some real talent coming through, there is no shortage of British talent, and we know we can show that we can mix it with the best on the world stage when it matters.\n\n\"The next four years is about supporting that talent that's coming through and also making sure that we do everything we can so that when they get here on finals day, they are absolutely at their best.\"\n\nUK Sport's investment is not an ever-growing pot, however, and sports are being encouraged to work together and share resources where possible to build towards the greater good.\n\nGosling, whose GB Snowsport organisation received £7.3m in UK Sport funding for its 2026 Olympic programme but has had to bring in extra commercial revenue, said: \"We know we have the talent and the capability and the world has now seen it.\n\n\"We can deliver medals with what we have. We have demonstrated that, but we have greater potential than we're demonstrating right now.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is just the start. This is not the peak for us. There's so much more that we can achieve. And I'm super excited because the athletes that are competing and are just near missing, are those athletes that are still very young with a great future ahead of them.\n\n\"And guess what? 2030 is just on the doorstep and we'll be back and we'll be showing them. Let's hope we'll convert those near misses to golds.

    "fullText": "The United States won the men's Olympic ice hockey gold medal for the first time in 46 years by beating neighbours Canada 2-1 in a sensational conclusion to the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe final gold medal of the Games was sealed by Jack Hughes in overtime after the USA withstood pressure from the dominant Canadians throughout most of the match, goalkeeper Connor Hellebuyck having the game of his life.\n\nIt is the first time since the 'Miracle on Ice' at Lake Placid in 1980 that the USA's men have won Olympic gold.\n\nAnd it is the first time the Americans have won the competition outside of their home country.\n\nThis was the second ice hockey final between USA and Canada at Milan-Cortina 2026, after the American women triumphed in their gold medal match - also 2-1 in overtime.\n\nNow, the men have completed a remarkable double triumph.\n\nAfter a tight start, USA broke through in brilliant style through some individual magic by Matt Boldy.\n\nBoldy picked up the puck inside his own half, chipped it over two defenders and outmuscled them to collect it before nudging it around a stranded Jordan Binnington.\n\nCanada, as they had in the previous two knockout rounds, needed to come from behind but struggled to build momentum until towards the end of the second period.\n\nThe USA defended manfully, including a period when they were three against five with two in the penalty box.\n\nBut in the 38th minute, a quick switch from Devon Toews found Cale Makar wide open on the right and he drove the puck past Hellebuyck.\n\nCanada continued to dominate in the third period, and in regular time had 41 shots to USA's 26.\n\nBut they seemed to find every possible way not to score. Hellebuyck kept out Mitch Marner from close range with a stunning piece of goalkeeping, before Nathan MacKinnon somehow swept wide of an open goal at the back post.\n\nAnd the Americans came close to re-taking the lead themselves at the end of the second period when Brock Faber's slap shot deflected off the post.\n\nIt meant three-on-three overtime for the first time in Olympic history. In the gold medal match, both teams field three players plus a goalkeeper in overtime, and play until a goal is scored with no shootout.\n\nAnd after both sides had chances, 101 seconds into overtime Hughes buried his shot to write his name into American sporting folklore.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nThis game had an extra edge, thanks in part to the presence of NHL players at the Olympics for the first time since 2014.\n\nThere was also the political angle. When these sides met in February 2025, it came in the shadow of USA president Donald Trump threatening tariffs on Canada and referring to their northern neighbours as the 51st state.\n\nTrump was not present in Milan, and neither was Canadian prime minister Mark Carney who was pictured watching the final in Quebec.\n\nAfter the game, the official White House account on X tweeted, external a picture of a bald eagle - a national animal of the USA - attacking a Canada goose, responding to a post from former Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nIn last year's match, there were three fights in the first nine seconds. While the players kept their cool here with much more on the line, there was still plenty of heat from the crowd.\n\nThe supporters at Santagiulia were partisan in favour of the Canadians, with the USA team roundly booed before face-off.\n\nHowever Canada were given a major blow pre-match with the absence of talismanic captain Sidney Crosby.\n\nThe 38-year-old, a veteran of the Olympic triumphs in 2010 and 2014, was forced off in their last-eight win over Czech Republic with a knee injury. Crosby missed the Finland semi-final and Canada's coaches hoped to have him available today - but he was not in the squad.\n\nAnd his leadership was missed as Canada dominated large parts of the game but lacked coolness under pressure to convert their myriad of chances.\n\nThe USA instead claimed their country's 12th gold of these Games, finishing second in the medal table. Canada end a disappointing 11th.\n\nAfter the game, USA players carried the jersey of former team mate Johnny Gaudreau who was killed by a drunk driver in August 2024.",

    "fullText": "It's fair to say Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix has set a high bar moving forward after a fantastic 2025 season. Nix was a huge part of the reason for the Broncos' success on offense, creating plays with his arm and his legs.\n\nNix created many highlight-level plays and late-game magic through several games in 2025. The best example of Nix's clutch gene came in a midseason matchup against the New York Giants. After having not scored at all through 45 minutes of play, Nix rallied the Broncos back from a 19-0 deficit in the final quarter, and led one of the most epic comebacks in franchise history, securing a 33-32 win. Nix had several games this season where he did his best Tim Tebow impression.\n\nThrough the season, Nix made history again and again, both team history and NFL history.\n\nOne of his most memorable performances during the year was his divisional round masterpiece against the Buffalo Bills, leading Denver to its first postseason win in a decade. In the win, Nix went 26-of-46 for 279 yards, three passing touchdowns and one interception. Nix showed the moment is not too big, and stepped up to the plate in a big way. Sadly, Nix's season ended shortly after the game, with a broken ankle.\n\nYou can watch some of Nix's greatest hits from his second season below.\n\nThe bar has been set, and as Nix recovers from the ankle surgery that ended his 2025 season, he'll look to return even better in 2026.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: Denver Broncos: Watch Bo Nix’s impressive highlights from 2025 season",

And it's gonna be this team. I believe it. I firmly believe this is the best team in the tournament.\"\n\nEruzione goes on to reference that some of the players on this year's team have referenced the movie Miracle as inspiration on the journey to this point.\n\nNow, he wants them to write their own story.\n\nThis U.S. luge star was parodied on SNL\n\nMikaela Shiffrin just broke the Olympics\n\nMegan Keller's childhood dreams culminate in a dream come true\n\nU.S. women's hockey star's brothers go viral at Olympics\n\nControversy and cursing with Canada curling\n\nA dog stole the show at the finish line of cross country skiing",

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chiefs' loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV forced an offseason change to improve the offensive line's protection of Patrick Mahomes. The adjustment was witnessed firsthand by former safety Tyrann Mathieu, who believes the same standards should apply to the New England Patriots.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowler spoke about the situation during a recent episode of his podcast 'In the Bayou with Tyrann Mathieu'.\n\n\"New England should take sort of the Kansas City Chiefs approach. After we lost [Super Bowl LV]… the very next day, they got new offensive linemen,\" said Mathieu, \"You gotta be able to protect the product.\"\n\nTyrann Mathieu’s thoughts on the #Patriots Super Bowl loss:\n\n“New England should take sort of the Kansas City Chiefs approach.

Lopez (@LosTalksPats) February 16, 2026\n\nMathieu's comments echo those of many who watched the Seattle Seahawks defense dominate the Patriots' offensive line in Super Bowl LX. Left tackle Will Campbell was the target of much of the criticism, although he had an impressive season.\n\nThe Chiefs notably signed Orlando Brown Jr., Joe Thuney, and Kyle Long after Super Bowl LV to vastly improve their offensive line for the following season. New England is expected to focus on Drake Maye's protection during the offseason after he was sacked an NFL record 21 times during the 2025 postseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Tyrann Mathieu suggests Patriots learn from Chiefs' Super Bowl LV loss",

    "title": "NFL 2026 trade scenarios, Part 1: Who deals for Maxx Crosby?!",
    "description": "Let's run through some possible trade scenarios.",
    "fullText": "As the 2026 NFL offseason nears, it's worth looking at some possible trade scenarios for some of the league's top players. Who might get dealt around March's kickoff to the new NFL year?\n\nIn a first of three parts, we've imagined some possible NFL trades featuring some of the biggest names in the league. Don't worry; we hit the ground running with some real blockbusters involving elite talent.\n\nWe'll have 10 more trade ideas coming your way in the time to come, but it'll be good to get started off on the right foot. Who might wind up elsewhere? What would the trade packages look like? Inquire within!\n\nWill Crosby actually be dealt? Your guess is as good as mine, but Mike Vrabel has to be banging the tables to bring in the ace pass-rusher. The Patriots defense having that kind of edge rusher to wreak havoc would go such a long way to complement the tight secondary coverage. While Crosby can't protect Drake Maye's blindside, he'd make the quarterback's life easier by adding more balance to the other side of the ball. If the Patriots can improve their pass-rush with Crosby, they'll be better than they were in 2025. It'd be a slam-dunk to bolster a Super Bowl contender into a new league altogether on defense. In return, the Raiders could get a nice package of picks and a solid addition to the edge room in Anfernee Jennings to at least take a little of the bite out of trading away Crosby.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Crosby to New England for a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 second-round pick and Jennings\n\nThe Titans desperately need to get quarterback Cam Ward a field-stretching wide receiver to take his game to the next level. Tennessee, flushed with cap space, could make Moore an integral part of the Titans' passing game without sending away too much draft compensation. With wide receiver Calvin Ridley a very possible cut candidate, the Titans could really use a veteran in the room like Moore. Ward being able to air it out a bit more would be huge for his development; Moore could also use a fresh start after getting a decrease in targets with Ben Johnson. Let's say the Titans send a third-round pick back to Chicago to get this done; that feels reasonable for both sides.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Moore to Tennessee for a 2026 third-round pick\n\nThe Vikings desperately need to undo the Sam Darnold decision. Watching Darnold win a Super Bowl with Seattle has to burn like the heat of a thousand suns for Minnesota fans who watched J.J. McCarthy struggle in his first full year as a starter. McCarthy's future already feels in flux as a Viking, and Minnesota's contention window may not support his clear need for more development. Enter Mac Jones. The 49ers can sleep easy with Jones as their backup to Brock Purdy, but could Minnesota pry Jones away by throwing McCarthy into the trade package? Perhaps Kyle Shanahan would be intrigued by the idea of developing McCarthy behind Purdy as a more long-term insurance plan. Jones proved in 2025 that he could be a decent starter in the right system. Swapping out Shanahan for Kevin O'Connell could keep the positive streak going for the former Patriots first-round pick. McCarthy could step back into the shadows to develop under Shanahan's watch, and Jones could start for a playoff-ready roster. Win-win?\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Jones to Minnesota for McCarthy, a 2026 sixth-round pick and a 2027 conditional third-round pick\n\nBrown's time with Philadelphia feels tenuous at best. The incredibly talented wideout helped bring a Super Bowl to the City of Brotherly Love, but an uneven 2025 campaign leans toward both sides needing a clean break. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman won't trade Brown for nothing, but we think it's very possible he's sent elsewhere. Where would he go? How about Las Vegas? Presumed Raiders rookie quarterback Fernando Mendoza will need a strong infrastructure to grow with, and Brown could instantly solve the team's wide receiver woes. A trio of Brown, tight end Brock Bowers and running back Ashton Jeanty could skyrocket Mendoza's development and give new coach Klint Kubiak plenty to work with in his first year as a head coach. Let's say a package of draft picks and a potential Dallas Goedert replacement convinces Roseman to trade Brown before the league year gets going.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Brown and a 2027 seventh-round pick to Las Vegas for a 2026 second-round pick, a 2027 fifth-round pick and tight end Michael Mayer\n\nThomas still has sky-high potential in the NFL, even if his future with the Jacksonville Jaguars is in flux. He's only TK and has so much football ahead of him. If he hits with the right team, the payoff could be enormous for both sides... and Thomas is still on a rookie deal. Jacksonville could probably get a really nice return on Thomas, too. Where might he go? How about the Commanders? Washington desperately needs more pop in the passing game to keep quarterback Jayden Daniels from scrambling too much. The team's soaring 2024 crashed and burned in 2025, so a rebound will be vital for all parties to keep their seats from getting hot. Thomas could replace Deebo Samuel as wide out Terry McLaurin's running mate and give Washington a potentially lethal deep threat for Daniels. Jacksonville could get a good draft pick and a young wideout from Washington in return and send Thomas to the NFC.\n\nTRADE PACKAGE: Thomas to Washington for a conditional 2027 second-round pick and WR Jaylin Lane\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL 2026 trade scenarios, Part 1: Who deals for Maxx Crosby?!",

    "description": "In this new mock draft, the Steleers trade back out of the first round to stockpile picks for next year.",
    "fullText": "For the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2026 NFL draft was supposed to be the draft that fixed their quarterback problems. The team has 12 picks and going into the season, this quarterback class was supposed to be generational in talent.\n\nOnce the season got going, the quarterback class was exposed and when the dust settled on the college football season, only one quarterback emerged as a legit first-round draft pick. This means the Steelers are more likely to trade back in the first round and even out of it as opposed to staying put. This would allow the Steelers to build picks for next year's draft in hopes the quarterback class is better.\n\nSo let's break down the trades and the picks in this new mock draft update.\n\nSteelers send the No. 21 overall pick and the No. 238 overall pick to the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens send Pittsburgh the No. 45 overall pick, the No, 80 overall pick along with a second-round pick and a third-round pick in 2027.\n\nThe more we watch Bernard and his versatility, the more we like his fit with the Steelers to pair up with DK Metcalf. He lines up all over the field, has a high football IQ and reminds us a lot of Deebo Samuel.\n\nHood stepped into the No. 1 role for Tennessee last season and showed a very high ceiling as a cover corner. His frame is a little light but he makes up for it with\n\nGolday is a big, powerful inside linebacker who plays with great acceleration and exceptional instincts. If the Steelers release Patrick Queen, this pick is a bargain.\n\nSmart, athletic free safety with a nose for the football and a high football IQ and lots of leadership intangibles.\n\nWhether it's Connor Heyward or Jonnu Smith, we add Bentley here as a Swiss Army knife tight end who is an underrated blocker and receiver.\n\nWashington is an impressive blend of power and speed and he put on quite a show at the Senior Bowl. With Kenneth Gainwell likely to leave in free agency, Washington is the perfect pick.\n\nExcellent developmental guard prospect with solid experience and measurables.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Breaking down the Steelers' picks in mock after trade back",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers will celebrate Pat Riley with an unveiling of a statue outside Crypto.com Arena on Sunday, Feb. 22.\n\nThe team will hold a private ceremony before the Lakers’ tip-off against the rival Boston Celtics on Sunday afternoon.\n\nRiley played an integral role in helping the Lakers’ organization achieve on-court success and a strong brand identity during the 1980s.\n\nIt will be the 15th statue outside of Crypto.com Arena, joining a list of other notable figures from LA Sports history, including Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nRiley has spent 58 years in the NBA, serving as a player, coach, and executive.\n\nHe’s won an NBA championship in each of those roles, including as a player (1972), assistant coach (198), and a coach (1982, 1985, 1987-88). He also led the Miami Heat to a championship as a head coach in 2006 and as an executive in 2012 and 2013.\n\nRiley not only helped bring championships to the respective organizations but also instilled a unique culture.\n\nRiley became the perfect fit for the Lakers during the 1980s, which is referred to as the \"Showtime Lakers\" era because it blended the perfect combination of Hollywood flair and on-court showmanship using a roster that included Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy.\n\nRiley matched that flair with his own signature slicked-back hair and Armani suits. The legend’s success and signature look have carried on in the decades that followed.\n\nHe currently serves as the Miami Heat’s president, a role he’s had since 1995 and applied what he’s learned during his time with the Lakers.\n\nRiley drafted Dwyane Wade and acquired Shaquille O'Neal before winning his first title away from the Lakers in 2006. He would resign as head coach in 2008, but would remain in his role as president. As an executive, he helped build a super team, having Chris Bosh and LeBron James join Wade to win back-to-back titles for Miami.\n\nRiley is among the all-time winningest coaches in NBA history, compiling a record of 1,210-694 (.636%). He was enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Lakers to honor Pat Riley with statue outside of arena",

    "description": "Deion Sanders introduces a spring draft for Colorado football, splitting the Buffs into teams with hopes of boosting competition and leadership.",
    "fullText": "Deion Sanders does not get to play a spring game against another program, but he found another way to add intrigue to the program's annual showcase.\n\nThe Colorado Buffaloes held a spring football draft last week, during which the program's leaders split up to select teams. One team, led by cornerback RJ Johnson, tight ends Brady Kopetz and Zach Atkins, surprised the room by selecting true freshman quarterback Kaneal Sweetwyne with the top pick instead of quarterback Julain Lewis. Safety Ben Finneseth, linebacker Bo LaPenna and running back DeKalon Taylor lead the second team, with them selecting Lewis with the No. 2 overall pick.\n\nJohnson's team also selected running back Richard Young, wide receiver Kam Perry and freshman four-star linebacker Carson Crawford. Standout players on Finneseth's squad include wide receiver Danny Scudero, linebacker Gideon Lampron and running back Damian Henderson II.\n\nInteresting...True freshman QB Kaneal Sweetwyne was picked No. 1 overall in Colorado's spring ball draft. JuJu Lewis went No. 2 pic.twitter.com/SqLblI6KXU\n\n— LockedOnBuffs (@LockedOnBuffs) February 21, 2026\n\nSanders spoke to the program after the selection process, explaining the new spring ball outlook.\n\n\"Some days, we're not gonna change jerseys. Some days, we're gonna have an all-team day,\" Sanders told the squad. \"You're going to go out there in the color of your team. That's how we're gonna get down. From the jump, it's gonna be like that. It's gonna be this side over here, this color, that's how we stretch. The whole day is gonna be competitive, and we're gonna go at it. From 1-on-1 to inside run, we're keeping score, we're keeping count of everything.\"\n\nClearly, Sanders is changing his philosophy following a 3-9 2025 season that saw his program severely lack player leadership. Spring camp is really the only time a college football program can go fully into culture-building mode without the stress of preparing for games. The team's first approach is refreshing to see for a CU program that seemed to miss accountability a year ago.\n\nThe two drafted teams will get the first chance to go at each other on March 2, the first day of spring practice. A few weeks later, on April 11, Colorado will play its annual spring game, where both teams will partake in a glorified scrimmage at Folsom Field.\n\nSpring camp is an exciting time for Deion Sanders' Buffs with so many new faces and plenty of position battles to be won.\n\nFollow Charlie Strella on X, Threads and Instagram.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Deion Sanders unveils Colorado football spring draft",

    "fullText": "New York Giants legend Eli Manning delivered a candid and optimistic assessment of quarterback Jaxson Dart's future during a recent appearance on ESPN New York with Dave Rothenberg and Rick DiPietro.\n\nAs the franchise transitions into a new era under head coach John Harbaugh, Manning expressed strong confidence in the direction of the team, particularly with Dart positioned as the long-term signal-caller.\n\nWhen asked about the excitement surrounding the Giants' fresh start, Manning responded affirmatively.\n\n\"No, I mean, I think you should be excited. I think the John Harbaugh hire,\" Manning said, \"you could not have asked for a better situation getting him... He’s the coach we needed, but usually, you know the coach that’s unavailable, and so I think there’s a lot of excitement there. You (have) Jaxson Dart... you have your quarterback of the future.\"\n\nManning went on to praise Dart's intangibles, highlighting his leadership qualities.\n\n\"Well, I just think he’s a great leader. I’ve seen that in the locker room, just how people talk about him. And obviously he has earned his teammates' respect through his preparation, through his play, and, you know, I think through his toughness,\" he said.\n\nThe two-time Super Bowl champion also offered pointed advice on the next phase of Dart's development, addressing the challenge many young, mobile quarterbacks face in balancing their athleticism with smarter decision-making.\n\n\"That’s kind of like the, you know, the next step for young quarterbacks is, hey, I have the ability to run, but I don’t want to do that too often. You know, I want to get the ball to the receivers,\" Manning said, \"it’s just kind of finding that sweet spot of, you know, when you know, hey, I need to get the ball out.\"\n\nManning's comments underscore a blend of endorsement and realism: Dart possesses the tools and presence to succeed, but refining his timing, progressions, and willingness to avoid unnecessary risks will be crucial to unlocking his full potential as the Giants' franchise quarterback.\n\nFans, long weary of quarterback instability, have reason for guarded optimism in this pairing of elite coaching and emerging talent.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Eli Manning offers blunt take on New York Giants QB Jaxson Dart",

The captain missed the semifinal, and the final is on Sunday against Team USA.\n\nCrosby is the oldest player on Canada's roster and left the quarterfinal with a lower-body injury.\n\nHe's a third-line center and a member of the first powerplay unit, when healthy.\n\nIt doesn't seem like he'll be at his full health for the gold medal game. But can he play? You'd sure think Crosby wants to.\n\nMORE: Nathan MacKinnon went viral for his Olympic focus that paid off\n\nCrosby has officially been ruled OUT of the gold medal game.\n\nIt only came out an hour before opening faceoff, and it's a brutal outcome for Canada.\n\nCrosby had been given a chance to play by head coach Jon Cooper, but Cooper wouldn't give anything major to lean on in his comments Saturday.\n\nTSN's Ryan Rishaug reported Saturday that it's a 70% chance that Crosby suits up and plays. Turns out, it didn't happen.\n\nMORE: Megan Keller's childhood dreams culminate in a dream come true\n\nCanada would've love to have Crosby out there, but it's tricky.\n\nIf he dressed but then turned out not to be healthy enough to keep playing, Canada would've been one player light in its rotation.\n\nIn not playing, though, that's a major leader and an Olympic legend who they can't lean on on the ice.\n\nCrosby was said to be impacting conversations in the locker room during intermissions in the semifinal, so maybe he can at least do that again.\n\nMost fans in North America only learned the Crosby news once they woke up to their early alarm.

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders made some big changes to the coaching staff this offseason.\n\nOffensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury and defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. were both let go, and David Blough and Daronte Jones were brought in, respectively. Neither Blough nor Jones has ever been a coordinator at the NFL level, but they do have some familiarity with each other.\n\nJones was with the Vikings on the defensive coaching staff from 2022 to 2025. In 2022, Blough was a practice squad quarterback for the Vikings. Recently, Washington insider JP Finlay spoke with Jones about this connection with Blough.\n\nHe was really sharp, smart,\" said Jones of Blough. \"He ran the show. It was as smooth an operation as you could have because of his knowledge of the game.\"\n\nNew #Commanders OC David Blough was a practice squad QB with the Vikings in 2022 when new DC Daronte Jones was the DBs coach there\n\nJones talks with @JPFinlayNBCS about Blough from their time together in Minnesota\n\n\"He was really sharp... he ran the show\"#RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/5Lz8fynGmS\n\n— NBC4 Sports (@NBC4Sports) February 11, 2026\n\nBlough has rapidly moved up in the ranks since retiring from playing. The former quarterback was on the practice squad of the Detroit Lions in 2023 and joined Dan Quinn's staff in Washington in 2024 as the assistant quarterbacks coach.\n\nTavita Pritchard, who was the quarterbacks coach for the Commanders, took the head coaching job at Stanford, his alma mater. That, coupled with Kingsbury's departure, moved Blough up in the pecking order, and now he'll get his first shot at running an offense.\n\nJones, meanwhile, was the defensive coordinator for the LSU Tigers in 2021 before joining the staff of the Vikings. Jones is a Maryland native, so his first shot at being a coordinator will also be a homecoming.\n\n\"You never know how your paths may cross,\" Jones explained. \"You keep those relationships alive, and we had a great relationship when we were there. And now, years later, here we are.\"\n\nThe Commanders are certainly hoping for better results across the board in 2026. The team made a surprising run to the NFC Championship Game in 2024, but thanks to injuries and inconsistency, fell to 5-12 in 2025.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Daronte Jones on David Blough: 'Really sharp'",

The Italian side are not obliged to contact the club since less than six months are remaining on Senesi’s contract.\n\nJuventus are aiming to do an overhaul in defence after finding Gleison Bremer to be ineffective during the Galatasaray match and Daniele Rugani’s loan deal at Fiorentina. Federico Gatti is being targeted by several Premier League clubs, and it will be tough to hold on to him soon.",

    "description": "There isn’t another Trey Hendrickson out there and if there was, we couldn’t afford him. So now what?",
    "fullText": "The writing is on the wall that this was Trey Hendrickson’s last year in Cincinnati. So what now?\n\nThe Bengals pass rush has been an issue over the last few seasons, even with Hendrickson putting up 17.5 sacks in 2023 and 2024. Now they have to replace him, but can they?\n\nThe answer is no. To paraphrase the movie Moneyball. There isn’t another Trey Hendrickson out there, and if there was, we couldn’t afford him. But just like in Moneyball, maybe we can build him.\n\nThe Super Bowl Champion Seattle Seahawks had an incredible defense, but they didn’t have anyone with double-digit sacks.\n\nTheir leading sack artist was a three-way tie between Leonard Williams, Byron Murphy, and Uchenna Nwosu, all of whom had 7. Demarcus Lawrence wasn’t far behind with 6.\n\nI think 7 sacks is a very reasonable expectation for Myles Murphy next season. So can they find 3 more players to get in that neighborhood?\n\nThe obvious answer is Shemar Stewart. Of course, 7 sacks is more than he has had in his college and pro career combined at this point, so that is a large projection. But if he can stay healthy and be there for the entire offseason program, maybe he can get close. Let’s say 5.\n\nStill, I don’t want to rely on that. So the Bengals should look to add three players who are capable of hitting that golden number of 7 in free agency and the draft. At least one of whom needs to be on the interior.\n\nFor example, maybe you add Arnold Ebiketie and Vonn Miller.\n\nEbikitie just turned 27. The 2022 second-rounder had 6 sacks as a rotational player for the Falcons last season and is just entering the prime of his career.\n\nMiller is 10 years older, but still productive, with 9 sacks last season. Miller’s expertise could also benefit his teammates, as the young defensive front could learn a lot from the seasoned vet.\n\nThe duo of Ebiketie and Miller will probably cost less than Jaelan Phillips, freeing up money to be spent elsewhere on the defense.\n\nMurphy, Stewart, Ebiketie, and Miller would make for an excellent platoon of edge rushers.\n\nInside, B.J. Hill and Kris Jenkins are probably good for 3 sacks apiece, but the Bengals need their Larry Ogunjobi to bring a little bit more juice.\n\nJohn Franklin-Myers is out there but stands to make some serious coin. However, adding a Peter Woods or a Caleb Banks in the draft could do the trick.\n\nSo let’s say you make these moves. Maybe you get 7 sacks from Murphy, 6 each from Ebikitie and Miller, 5 from Stewart, maybe 5 more from Woods/Banks, and 2 or 3 a piece from Hill, Jenkins, and T.J. Slaton. Thanks a predictive unit. It won’t cost you too much, and the depth means that one injury won’t hamper your whole defense.\n\nThat’s the best way for the Bengals to get it done in a post-Trey Cincinnati.",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior and those around him have acknowledged that early concerns about Cole Palmer and his Chelsea teammates were unfounded.\n\nWhen Rosenior first took over as the Blues’ manager, there was plenty of scepticism. Many fans saw it as a cheap and uninspired choice following Enzo Maresca’s exit.\n\nRosenior has done well to change that narrative. He has won eight games, drawn two, and lost two – both defeats coming against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup.\n\nOne of the standout aspects has been how he has handled big names like Palmer. There are plenty of social media clips showing his relaxed approach, and behind the scenes, his man-management skills have been evident in how he’s communicated with players privately.\n\nThe Standard reported that those around Rosenior had concerns early on about whether Palmer and the other big names in the squad would get behind his methods.\n\nThey feared a lack of respect could become a problem.\n\nBut as results have improved, Rosenior has seen that the dressing room is more together than he expected. He also feels that each win is helping to strengthen his authority within the squad.\n\nThe 41-year-old manager himself addressed the issue, explaining that the perception of Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, and Palmer having egos is entirely incorrect.\n\nSince taking the job, Rosenior has quietened doubts about whether he could handle a squad packed with high-priced talent. He has focused on building strong relationships, especially with players like Palmer and Fernandez.\n\nThere was a moment at Molineux when the No. 10 interrupted the manager’s post-match interview after scoring a hat-trick. It felt like more than just a bit of fun – it was a sign that the dressing room is fully behind him.\n\nRosenior has also earned respect for his approach, often putting the focus on his players’ effort rather than his own methods.\n\nEven Fernandez, who had been linked to PSG before, appears re-energised under the Englishman. The midfielder has publicly acknowledged the head coach’s influence and thanked him for it.\n\nLiam Rosenior not ruling out Levi Colwill return for Chelsea this season\n\nFIFA looks to expand Club World Cup, but Chelsea haven’t even qualified yet",

    "fullText": "In the preview of tomorrow's match in Vitoria, Girona FC coach Míchel Sánchez conveyed a message of continuity and demand following last weekend's victory. The coach emphasized that despite the euphoria generated by the triumph against FC Barcelona, the team is now fully focused on the challenge of facing a Deportivo Alavés side characterized by their intensity at home. “It has been a good week after winning a very special match. But we need to keep doing things well and pursuing the goal of forty-two points, which will likely ensure safety,” said Míchel, reminding that the focus remains on securing survival as soon as possible.\n\nThe coach warned of the difficulties of the match at Mendizorrotza and the need to deliver a very solid performance: “We have to go to Vitoria with the mentality we have now. Alavés, at home, is very intense and performs very well. We have to play a great game to beat them. We must continue with this dynamic of play.”\n\nMíchel insisted on the importance of maintaining the principles that have allowed the team to grow in recent matches: “We must be able to maintain what we are doing well, we must be compact and fight for every ball.”\n\nRegarding the team's good form, the coach highlighted that the improvement is the result of collective work: “We have changed because we have done things better as a team. The result always shapes the mentality, but to have a good mentality, you have to work.”\n\nDespite the euphoria following the victory against Barça, Míchel assures that the team is already fully refocused on tomorrow's match: “Today we had a very good training session. After the victory against Barça, there was logical euphoria, but now we have moved from that euphoria to having confidence and being focused on doing things well.”\n\nThe coach also highlighted the defensive progress of the red-and-white team: “We have improved a lot in the defensive zone. The other day against Barça was the match where we conceded the fewest shots on goal in the entire league. That says a lot about our defensive improvement.”\n\nFinally, he celebrated the internal competition within the squad: “It is very good to have problems selecting the starting eleven because I have many players at my disposal and in good form,” and he concluded with a message of ambition and confidence: “In any scenario, we can do things well.”",

    "fullText": "A resurgent Manchester United have the chance to add to Everton's poor recent home form in the final fixture of the Premier League weekend on Monday at Hill Dickinson Stadium (20:00 GMT).\n\nHaving been eliminated from the FA Cup in the third round, both sides have had nearly a fortnight to reflect on their previous results in the top flight.\n\nEverton were undone by eight minutes of chaos at home to Bournemouth to lose 2-1, while United salvaged a point at West Ham United in stoppage time.\n\nEverton are in a curious position at the moment. After numerous seasons of flirting with relegation, the table looks a lot rosier - they started the weekend in eighth position - yet there is still some frustration around recent performances at home.\n\nThe calamitous manner in which they threw away a winning position against Bournemouth left supporters angry, as a chance to consolidate a spot in the European positions was tossed away.\n\nIt's now six games without a win at Hill Dickinson Stadium in all competitions; they have lost five of their last nine Premier League home games, as many as they had in their previous 28.\n\nThat run is in stark contrast to the team's away form; they've won five, drawn four and lost one of their last nine.\n\nManager David Moyes will be hoping a visit from a big-name opponent can ignite the mood at the new 52,000-seat arena. The number of midweek games and Monday night matches have been a big factor in a number of low-key atmospheres at their new home.\n\nUnited have 19 away wins and 42 wins overall against Everton in the Premier League, more than any team has against another team in the competition's history.\n\nThe Toffees did get the better of the Red Devils previously though, as they rallied from an early Idrissa Gueye red card to win 1-0 at Old Trafford thanks to a Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall goal. A win for Everton on Monday would give them just their second Premier League double over United, the first coming in 2013-14 when Moyes was in charge of the Red Devils.\n\nThat defeat in November was arguably the nadir for former boss Ruben Amorim. Plenty has changed since, with Michael Carrick in charge and the team playing with a renewed sense of freedom.\n\nThe draw at West Ham may have ended Carrick's winning start, but the team will take heart from the manner in which they fought to the end.\n\nBenjamin Sesko's stoppage-time goal - his second in three games - was enough to extend the team's current unbeaten streak to nine. The improved form of the £74m summer transfer will be a big relief at Old Trafford.\n\nOverall, United have been the best team in the division in 2026, with no side able to better their haul of 15 Premier League points for the year; they have also scored more open play goals than any team since Carrick took charge.\n\nAgainst a muddled opponent - their favourite opponent - they will be confident of adding to that on Merseyside.",

    "fullText": "Between now and the summer, Manchester United will inevitably continue to be linked with some of the finest midfielders in the game.\n\nIndeed, it is football’s worst-kept secret that the 20-time English champions are desperate to strengthen their engine room.\n\nWith Casemiro set to leave, Manuel Ugarte failing to convince as his replacement, and the clear need for quality additions, United could therefore embark on a full midfield overhaul.\n\nOnly weeks after Everton’s Amadou Onana openly expressed his desire to join a world-class club, The Peoples Person recently covered a report suggesting that United were keen to reignite their interest in the Belgian midfielder.\n\nNow, according to Football Insider, Aston Villa have responded to the Onana-to-United speculation.\n\nThe outlet claims: “Aston Villa are determined to keep hold of Amadou Onana beyond the end of the season.”\n\nFurthermore, the report adds: “Unai Emery views the 24-year-old as an important part of his first-team squad and hopes he will continue the positive progress he has made at Villa Park.”\n\nConsequently, there is genuine hope at Villa Park that Onana will stay. The belief is that “there are other names on their list of targets which may give Villa confidence they can keep hold of him.”\n\nNevertheless, as Villa fight to retain their star man, it remains to be seen whether United will persist in their pursuit of Onana. After all, the Red Devils have admired him for a long time, having tried to sign him from Everton in 2024 before he opted to join Villa instead.\n\nSince then, at Villa Park, Onana has blossomed into one of the Premier League’s finest central midfielders.\n\nHis rapid recovery pace, ability to break opposition lines, and ball-carrying strength have combined to make him a top-tier destroyer with genuine box-to-box qualities.\n\nAs a result, he is, without doubt, a player United could rely on as a brilliant Casemiro replacement, while at the same time offering a fresh dynamic in midfield.\n\nFeatured image Dan Mullan via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

The player later apologised to the fans for his mistakes, taking ownership of his actions.\n\nIn an official statement, Real Madrid have confirmed Ceballos has been diagnosed with a muscle tear in the soleus muscle in his right leg.\n\nAccording to COPE, Ceballos’ fresh injury could rule him out of action for at least seven weeks. This means he will miss most of the key matches that will define Real Madrid’s season.\n\nReal Madrid will be ruled out for at least seven weeks due to injury. (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough the Spaniard wasn’t a key component in Alvaro Arbeloa’s plans, his injury will put pressure on the team by restricting the coach’s rotational options.\n\nFrom a long-term perspective, this will mark the end of Ceballos’ stint at Real Madrid, with recent reports suggesting that the club are more than keen on offloading the player in the summer.\n\nClub president Florentino Perez is not happy with Ceballos at all and it appears Real Madrid are ready to sanction his sale for just €10 million at the end of the season.\n\nIf there was a chance of a late revival, those chances disappeared after his poor showing against Osasuna. And now, with the injury, the Spaniard will no longer be able to prove himself at the Bernabeu.",

    "fullText": "Why Sidney Crosby isn't playing for Canada in gold medal game vs. USA with injury news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's devastating news for Team Canada as the gold medal men's hockey game at the 2026 Winter Olympics has arrived on Sunday in Milan against Team USA.\n\nSidney Crosby, the Canadian captain and all-time great, has been ruled out. He's not playing. In what likely would've been his final Olympic game, Crosby can only watch.\n\nIt's a bummer for Canada, which advanced through the semifinal stage without Crosby.\n\nConnor McDavid will again don the captain's 'C'.\n\nCrosby was said to be a positive influence in the locker room between periods of the semifinal, and Canada will hope he can replicate that in the final.\n\nMORE: Eileen Gu responds to hate only way she knows how\n\nCrosby is out due to a lower-body injury sustained in the Olympic quarterfinal.\n\nIn that game against Czechia, Crosby took three hits on one shift early in the second period.

    "fullText": "Since Arne Slot's arrival almost two years ago, Liverpool's squad has changed an awful lot.\n\nIndeed, most of the changes ended up occurring during the last summer transfer window but, right from the off, it was clear that Slot's gameplan was completely different to Jurgen Klopp's.\n\nIn his first season, Liverpool's system stayed relatively similar but in the 2025-26 campaign, the Dutchman built his own team and the club have been struggling.\n\nA lot of this is down to the many changes that the Reds made in such a short space of time but now, it seems like one of those players that Slot got rid of in the summer could be coming back to the Premier League.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold's summer departure is arguably the one that hurt Liverpool fans the most.\n\nThe vast majority of the Reds' fanbase believed that the Englishman would see out the entirety of his career in L4 and eventually become the captain.\n\nHowever, that wasn't mean to be and, in the end, he chose to join Real Madrid to experience football in another way.\n\nUnfortunately, things haven't quite gone to plan with the Englishman often being left on the bench which has resulted in several transfer rumours emerging.\n\nAnd now, as per an update from Fichajes, the most insane rumour of all has decided to crop up.\n\nAccording to the Spanish outlet, Manchester United are the frontrunners to sign the Liverpool academy graduate.\n\nThe Red Devils are willing to pay around £43 million to secure his services and see him as an 'interesting' market opportunity.\n\nA fee in this region would be 'attractive' to Real Madrid with United looking to strengthen their defence next season.\n\nEven though things ended badly between Liverpool and Alexander-Arnold, there's no way that the defender would ever join their arch-rivals.\n\nNot only is the defender a Liverpool supporter himself but, if he did end up joining Michael Carrick's men, there would be no way back for him at Anfield, even if he begged the club to take him back.\n\nNot only this, but last season, when the Reds won the Premier League, Manchester United failed to even qualify for any sort of European competition with the club finishing the campaign in 15th place.\n\nThis season, their position is slightly higher than Liverpool's but, without any sort of European football to worry about, their schedule is much less packed.\n\nIf Alexander-Arnold did join United, he'd be their first-choice right-back without question but, in our eyes, he'd be better off fighting for his place under Alvaro Arebola, especially after the Spaniard said he was happy to have Alexander-Arnold among his ranks.",

    "fullText": "Paris Saint-Germain has become the latest club to join Arsenal in the race for Julian Alvarez, amid growing indications that this could be his final season at Atletico Madrid. The Spanish side does not wish to part ways with the forward, however, his ongoing difficulties in adapting to their system may ultimately compel them to reconsider their position.\n\nArsenal, alongside several other clubs, continues to monitor his situation closely, with the Gunners convinced that he has already demonstrated his quality during his time in England. A potential move to the Emirates Stadium could prove attractive, particularly as Arsenal operates in a style similar to that of his former club, Manchester City.\n\nDespite Arsenal’s sustained interest, Barcelona is understood to be Alvarez’s preferred destination. Nevertheless, the Catalan side may encounter financial constraints that could hinder their ability to meet the demands required to secure his transfer. This uncertainty leaves the door open for other suitors to intensify their pursuit.\n\nThe attacker is said to be determined to finish the current campaign strongly before making any final decision regarding his future. According to Sport Witness, Arsenal is now facing a significant challenge from Paris Saint-Germain in the race to secure his signature. The report claims that the French champions possess the financial capacity to pursue any leading player, which could present a considerable obstacle for the Gunners.\n\n(Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nWhile Atletico Madrid would prefer to retain Alvarez, the tactical mismatch may leave them with limited options should interest continue to grow. Both Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain are expected to deploy their most persuasive strategies once the season concludes, as they seek to convince him to commit to their respective sporting projects.\n\nWith financial strength, tactical suitability, and long-term ambition all likely to influence the final outcome, the coming months are set to be decisive in determining where Alvarez will continue his career.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo here are some simple rules which I must insist commenters follow….\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

    "title": "America's hottest NIMBY issue: Data centers",
    "description": "As politicians can't ignore data centers anymore, everyone from Bernie Sanders to Ron DeSantis is turning against them.",
    "fullText": "It's not often that Ron DeSantis, Josh Hawley, Bernie Sanders, and Elizbaeth Warren find common ground. But as more voters grow critical of AI data centers — the sprawling, humming, energy-guzzling campuses that power everything from pharmaceutical research to your AI girlfriend — they and many other politicians are squaring off with Big Tech and calling to regulate the burgeoning behemoths.\n\nIn New York, lawmakers have proposed a three-year moratorium on developing new centers. \"Massive data centers are gunning for New York, and right now we are completely unprepared,\" state Senator Liz Krueger said when announcing the bill earlier this month. Georgia, Maryland, and Oklahoma are among a handful of states that have introduced bills this year to pause data center construction. National and local politicians are calling for data centers to pay their fare share of rising utility costs. Sanders has gone so far to call for a national moratorium, arguing it would help America to \"catch up\" and \"make sure that the benefits of these technologies work for all of us, not just the wealthiest people on Earth.\"\n\nUntil recently, most states have courted data centers, enticed by promises that they will create jobs and sprout long-term revenue from vacant land. Some three dozen offer tech companies tax incentives for building them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But now that they're inching closer to everyone's backyard, data centers have become the hottest NIMBY issue. Money spent toward data center development jumped by tens of billions in 2024, and some Big Tech companies plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property and equipment this year. At the end of 2025, there were more than 4,000 data centers in the US and nearly 3,000 more planned or under construction, according to a report from the American Edge Project, a pro-tech coalition. As the centers have multiplied, so have protests around environmental concerns and rising energy costs.\n\nThe data center battle is vying for attention in a heated midterm election cycle where most of the focus will turn on President Donald Trump, the economy, and immigration. Flavio Hickel, a professor of American politics at Washington College in Maryland, says data centers could be a piece of the big economic stressors for voters. \"The issue is becoming both more tangible and more salient to the average voter,\" he says.\n\nIf Big Tech is eying your town to build a data center, your local politicians may start sounding the alarm before November.\n\nBetween March and June of last year, advocates and residents delayed or blocked $98 billion worth of proposed data center projects in their towns, according to Data Center Watch, a project from the AI safety company 10a Labs. The opposition has gotten so loud that more Americans are starting to think they don't want a data center anywhere near their home. A November survey by Morning Consult found that 41% of voters are in favor of a ban on AI data centers near where they live, an increase from 37% in October. Opposition to a ban has waned from 39% in October to 36% in November. There's still about a fifth of people in the middle who don't have feelings on data centers yet, but their numbers are shrinking. A poll conducted in January by Politico and Public First found that Republicans were 8% more supportive of data centers in their area than Democrats, but that overall 17% of Americans expected data center regulations to be a voting factor in the midterm elections, and 57% said they believed the data centers will at some point become a campaign issue where they live.\n\nTrump wants data centers to be part of the MAGA agenda. Tech leaders that once espoused progressive values dropped their \"woke\" act and lined up behind Trump for his second inauguration, and now Trump has issued executive orders to support the AI industry. The Politico poll found that people who voted for Trump were more likely to support the idea of building more data centers across the U.S. than those who voted for Kamala Harris by 12%. Trump, like the tech companies courting him, positions the centers are quintessential to fueling American competition in the AI race. Last summer, the president issued an executive order to boost data center construction, saying his administration would make the \"rapid and efficient buildout of this infrastructure\" a priority by cutting away regulatory red tape and using federal land.\n\nBig Tech companies need the centers far more than local communities need them — without more computing power, AI companies can't expand their footprint. Sam Altman poses this as a threat to humanity: \"If we don't build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over, and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people,\" he wrote in 2024. Trump has called for Big Tech to start picking up the additional energy costs. Data centers are \"key\" to make American first in AI, Trump wrote on Truth Social last month, \"but, the big Technology Companies who build them must 'pay their own way.'\"\n\nIf data centers don't start footing the bill for higher energy use, voters are likely to keep turning on them. A Bloomberg analysis found that electric bills have increased by as much as 267% in areas near \"significant data center activity\" compared to five years ago. \"People are upset about costs,\" says Eli Yokley, a political analyst with Morning Consult. \"They don't think Trump is addressing it to the extent they want him to, and one of the big drivers of that — other than healthcare and everyday goods — is energy costs.\"\n\nBeyond affordability, politicians are also tapping into Americans' generalized anxiety over AI. White collar workers worry about losing their jobs to bots, and deepfake AI slop is ripping apart the remains of our shared reality. While data center construction is fueling demand for blue collar workers like electricians and plumbers, that's often a temporary blip in job creation, as maintaining the centers doesn't require many long-term jobs — according to a legislative audit in Virginia, data centers might employ 1,500 people during construction in good paying jobs, but need only 50 to keep the lights on later. DeSantis took a shot at the AI hype in December, saying: \"Let's not try to act like some type of fake videos or fake songs are going to deliver us to some kind of utopia.\" That month, the Florida governor announced a proposal to push higher costs from data center development from consumers onto tech companies, block tax subsidies for the centers, protect local water resources, and give towns and cities the power to block data centers from their communities.\n\nSenators Hawley, a Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, introduced Congress's first bipartisan legislation on curbing utility bill hikes this month. In Vermont, Virginia, and New York, Democratic lawmakers are leading the push for a moratorium. In Maryland and Oklahoma, the bills come from Republicans. In Georgia, a moratorium bill introduced in January has both Republican and Democratic sponsors. Lawmakers in other states from either party might continue to draw inspiration from these bills if their own constituents start making noise about data centers.\n\nMuch of the data center resistance is building locally, which brings the chance for liberals and conservatives to unite over shared concerns of costs and protecting their quality of life. The negative feelings people have about data centers are largely tied to their own energy costs — a local issue that's not yet an indictment of the centers at large. But as more communities fight to defeat them, it's more bad PR for Big Tech.\n\nParticularly for local politicians, having a position on data centers could be important this year.\n\nIn Virginia, home to the world's largest concentration of data centers, aka Data Center Alley, backlash has been mounting for several years. In 2023, a largely unknown primary challenger beat out the sitting chair on a Virginia county Board of Supervisors, harnessing frustration over the rapid development of data centers in the region. Candidates for governor in Michigan are already talking about data centers, and Abigail Spanberger, who was elected governor of Virginia last year, made energy affordability a campaign talking point. Local leaders may have approved data centers when they weren't as controversial of an issue, and emerging challengers can now attack that record. This election cycle, says Miquel Vila, lead analyst with Data Center Watch, \"data centers are going to be a very sweet issue for challengers and a pretty tough one for incumbents.\"\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "fullText": "A top Anthropic engineer said a new generation of AI agents capable of operating computers will reshape nearly every internet-based job in America.\n\nAnd he said the change is coming very soon.\n\nBoris Cherny — the creator of Claude Code at Anthropic, the company best known for its Claude chatbot — recently appeared on \"Lenny's Podcast,\" hosted by Lenny Rachitsky.\n\nHe said AI systems that can take action across workplace computer tools — like the ones Anthropic sells access to — are advancing rapidly and could soon alter responsibilities for software engineers, product managers, designers, and other knowledge workers.\n\n\"It's going to expand to pretty much any kind of work that you can do on a computer,\" Cherny said. \"In the meantime, it's going to be very disruptive. It's going to be painful for a lot of people.\"\n\nClaude Code is Anthropic's AI coding agent built on top of its Claude models. The company released its latest updates, called Opus 4.6, in early February.\n\nUnlike a traditional chatbot that generates text or images, an AI agent can use digital tools — running commands, analyzing documents, messaging colleagues, completing tasks across apps, and even building websites.\n\nEssentially, Claude Code can increasingly use a computer the way a human does — though the company recently said it has yet to reach the level of a skilled human.\n\n\"It's the thing that I think brings agentic AI to people that haven't really used it before, and people are starting to just get a sense of it for the first time,\" he said.\n\nCherny says his own team already relies on AI to work faster. Productivity per engineer has increased sharply since Claude Code's launch, he said. He believed the models will continue improving. (Of course, Cherny also has good reason to talk up the company's products, which it shops to enterprise companies.)\n\nCherny recently said in an interview with Y Combinator's \"Lightcone\" podcast that the job title software engineer will start to \"go away\" in 2026.\n\nThe broader impact remains uncertain, he warned.\n\n\"As a society, this is a conversation we have to figure out together,\" he told Rachitsky. \"Anyone can just build software anytime.\"\n\nFor workers navigating the shift, his advice is direct: experiment with AI tools and learn how they function.\n\n\"Don't be scared of them,\" he said.",

    "description": "David Ronca's cancer battle reshaped his career, including at Netflix. He learned to prioritize work-life balance and intentional productivity.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with David Ronca, a retired video systems engineer. He spent 12 years at Netflix and six years at Meta. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy time at a startup in the early years of my engineering career was like a really bad relationship.\n\nI joined a company that specialized in video playback around 2000. I loved working on video. I consider those seven years like going to school, and I came out with a Ph.D. in practical video systems. But it was the hardest seven years I've ever had in terms of work demands.\n\nI was told when I joined that it would be really important that you're seen around here a lot. So I would work until 7, 8, 9 — sometimes until 10 p.m. Then we started hitting delivery schedules, and I was getting to work around 10 in the morning and going home sometimes at 2:30 in the morning. We're talking 14-hours days, six to seven days a week. Eighty hours a week would've been a break.\n\nWe didn't have good direction. We'd be four or five months into solving a hard problem before leadership would stop us and say, \"Go work on this instead.\" It was madness.\n\nWe were using work hours to compensate for really bad decisions.\n\nIn January 2004, I started feeling ill. On a Sunday, I didn't feel so good, and by midweek, I got worse.\n\nOn Friday night, January 17, my wife took me to the emergency room. The doctor told me, \"This is likely colon cancer.\" After the first surgery, he said, \"There's no way you have a tumor like this and it's not cancer.\"\n\nTwo weeks earlier, I had been running and feeling great. Within a week, I was in a hospital bed on machines.\n\nIt took another week before doctors could do the full surgery. And you spend that time with no idea what they're going to find. That was a very dark week.\n\nMy mother died of breast cancer when she was 48. I was 16. Now, I'm in the hospital at 44. I remember thinking, \"History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.\"\n\nMy wife would bring the three kids. My oldest, who was seven, would sit quietly in the room with me. My youngest was two years old. He didn't really know me.\n\nI was looking at my young son, thinking he's going to grow up without a dad.\n\nAfter surgery, they told me it was stage 3 colon cancer. They removed 60% of my colon. There was lymph node metastasis. My five-year survival prognosis was about 25%.\n\nI went back to work part-time at first.\n\nI was told that I had used up all my sick leave and vacation and was put on California disability, which is around $200 a week.\n\nI told my boss, \"I'm sorry, I will not do this. I still want to work here, but if I have to leave, I will quit. Because I will not work like this.\"\n\nFrom that point on, I didn't. And that was the irony of it all.\n\nI feel like I did some of my best engineering after that. The real change was that I was no longer wasting my brainpower and my thinking on junk.\n\nYou don't do good work after 12 hours. You can't work sustained all-nighters and be productive. The quality of your work is going to suck. I don't care who you are. For most mere mortals, you try to work those hours, you're just not going to be doing good work.\n\nI also started making intentional decisions for life, not just work.\n\nI coached soccer for all three of my kids. I went to their games. My daughter did ballet, and we were there all the time. We started planning and taking family vacations — hiking in the mountains, RV road trips, and Maui.\n\nI realized you have to work to have a life, but you have to have a life to work. So you want to stand in the middle of those things.\n\nIn 2007, after several clean scans, I joined Netflix. I delayed accepting the offer until I got my scan report. I didn't want to change jobs yet because if you have positive liver metastasis, you'd be lucky to get two years.\n\nIn my interview, Patty McCord, the chief talent officer at the time, told me, \"We don't value 24/7 work. You won't be successful here working all the time.\"\n\nThat was almost foreign to me. But it also didn't mean we didn't work hard.\n\nAt Netflix, I was part of the early streaming team — maybe 12 to 16 people. We made aggressive schedules, and we didn't miss them. We launched a Netflix app on the original iPad on Day One within two months.\n\nThe culture at the company was: If you have to work 24/7 for us to be successful, you've got a problem, and we've got a problem, and we're going to fix it.\n\nEven at Meta, my favorite poster had a silhouette of a rocking horse that said, \"Don't mistake motion for progress.\"\n\nIn other words, high performance is not measured by how much work you do. It's measured by how impactful your results are.\n\nThis is not to say that it's wrong to work more than eight hours. Instead, you should understand why you're working more hours. It should be intentional. Intentional exceptions.\n\nIf I were to tell my younger self anything, it would be to make work-life balance part of your DNA. Learn to take time off.\n\nDon't wait until you have cancer or some other near-death experience to realize this.",

    "description": "A management consultant who decided to quit his six-figure job after reading Brené Brown's 'Dare to Lead' shares the lessons he learned.",
    "fullText": "AJ Eckstein spent the first four years of his career chasing a \"dream job,\" following the formula he'd been told would lead to success.\n\nHe'd graduated from the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 2020, logging internships at companies including The Walt Disney Company along the way.\n\nIn February 2021, Eckstein started a full-time job as an analyst at a large consulting firm. Within a six-month period, he was promoted from analyst to senior analyst and then management consultant — roles that came with a six-figure salary.\n\nDespite his success, Eckstein felt underwhelmed.\n\n\"I realized I was just checking boxes and not actually living my dream life,\" the 27-year-old told Business Insider. \"I felt like a tiny, expendable cog in a massive machine.\"\n\nEverything changed in 2024 when Eckstein picked up \"Dare to Lead\" by Brené Brown. What started as just another book quickly became a turning point in his career and life, he said.\n\n\"It forced me to confront uncomfortable truths: I wasn't showing up authentically, taking risks, or living in line with my core values,\" Eckstein said. \"I'd been playing it safe, following a path others laid out for me instead of carving my own.\"\n\nBrown's book transformed how he approaches his career and helped him build a life on his own terms, inspiring him to do four game-changing things.\n\nThe book emphasized aligning your actions with your core values, which resonated with Eckstein. For him, those values were entrepreneurship, autonomy, and ownership of his business and personal brand.\n\n\"I had a stable job, a great salary, and a clear trajectory ahead of me — but I knew I couldn't ignore the values that were pulling at me,\" Eckstein said. \"I wanted to bet on myself.\"\n\nThe principles of \"Dare to Lead\" pushed Eckstein to take what he called \"the ultimate leap of faith\" — leaving his consulting career to build his own company, Creator Match, a platform that matches brands with LinkedIn creators.\n\nIt was a difficult decision for Eckstein to make, who said the fear of financial uncertainty and the pressure to conform weighed heavily on him. But the book helped him realize that taking the risk to pursue his passion was the only way he could truly be authentic and prioritize his values.\n\n\"It became clear that staying in my corporate job was holding me back from the life I truly wanted,\" he said. \"'Dare to Lead' taught me that courage isn't the absence of fear — it's the ability to take action despite it.\"\n\nOnce Eckstein made the leap and started building his company, the real challenge began. He needed to figure out how to turn his fledgling agency into a scalable platform.\n\n\"There were long nights, moments of doubt, and constant pivots,\" he said. \"I had to make decisions with little data, take risks when it felt uncomfortable, and embrace the fear of failure every day.\"\n\nThe lessons he learned from \"Dare to Lead\" — like the importance of stepping out of your comfort zone and having the courage to confront discomfort in order to lead effectively — kept him going.\n\n\"Every step of the way, 'Dare to Lead' reminded me that discomfort is where the magic happens — the place where growth and opportunity lie,\" Eckstein said.\n\nOne of the book's most transformative lessons for Eckstein is the idea of \"living into your values,\" which Brown defines as doing more than just giving lip service to your values, but actually practicing them.\n\n\"Brown emphasizes that when we clearly identify and commit to our core values, we can navigate uncertainty and challenge with purpose and integrity,\" Eckstein explained. \"One of my values is inspiring others to embrace their own authenticity and take bold steps toward their dreams, such as shooting your shot.\"\n\nIn Eckstein's case, living into his values meant saying yes when he got invited to speak at a TEDx Talk in 2024. \"Stepping onto that stage was an act of courage, but it wasn't just about me — it was about living out my values in a way that could empower others,\" he said.\n\n\"Dare to Lead\" also taught Eckstein that leadership isn't about perfection; it's about \"putting your values into practice, one vulnerable step at a time,\" he said.\n\nAs Eckstein pondered this principle after reading the book, he realized that some of the best moments along his educational and career paths had come not from knowing it all and getting everything right, but from the times that he admitted that he needed help.\n\nHe hadn't been the typical student who breezed through high school and landed at an elite university. Instead, he was a community college student who transferred to USC; he'd struggled, was unmotivated, and felt uncertain about his path.\n\n\"The world around me expected me to have everything figured out, but I didn't, and that scared me,\" Eckstein recalled. \"I was terrified of showing vulnerability and admitting I didn't have it all together.\"\n\n\"When I embraced my lack of certainty and was open to seeking help, it started me on a path of growth,\" he said. \"I realized I didn't have to have everything figured out to take action — I just needed to show up authentically and be willing to learn. And that's how you build a life and career that's truly your own.\"\n\nDid you read a book that changed your career trajectory or approach toward work?

    "title": "Revenge of the English majors: The age of AI is driving new respect for humanities skills",
    "description": "For years, English majors were mocked as useless. Now, AI is giving them some momentum in the job market, while computer science grads get disrupted.",
    "fullText": "At the University of Colorado Boulder, you can take a course co-taught by an applied mathematician and a Renaissance scholar.\n\n\"The students love it,\" said John-Michael Rivera, the school's dean of arts and humanities, of the class, which is called Inclusive Interdisciplinary Data Science for All.\n\nThe class gives STEM students a way to think about the ethics of AI, he said. In other courses, humanities majors can use their skills to evaluate how AI writes, what it means for the practice of writing, and what the \"self\" means in an AI world.\n\nRivera credits the creation of courses focusing on the intersection of AI and humanities with a resurgence in student interest in liberal arts degrees like English. Pre-pandemic, the number of English majors at the university was shrinking, part of a broader decline in English across the country, he said. It was a far cry from the days of over 1,500 majors and long waitlists in the early 2000s, according to Rivera. But there's been a rebound, with the number of English majors rising 9% since 2021.\n\nRivera said students \"want to know more about the 'why' these days. And that's what we do in humanities. We really engage in the 'why.'\"\n\nDerided by some as useless, the utility of the English major has long been questioned. Who needs to write essays (or articles) any\n\n\"We are certainly seeing organizations look more towards the soft skills, the accountability of a job, the identity of the person, their style, their empathy — their humanity,\" in a world that requires both humans and technology, said Bryan Ackermann, head of AI strategy and transformation at recruiting and organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry.\n\nFor the English majors, that's all offered some degree of vindication. As the conversation heats up over which skills will be useful in an AI world, one camp argues it's time for ideas, people, and critical thinkers to flourish. That means that, after years of mocking, English majors are finally getting recognized for their usefulness. Some schools are seeing enrollment in the major rise after years of decline; technical recruiters and experts are seeing greater demand for humanities skills. Call it the makeover of the English major.\n\nJessie Hennen directs the creative writing and literature programs at Southwest Minnesota State University, a large public school with a returning and transfer student population.\n\n\"They've had jobs, they have experience, and they're just like, we are not letting AI take creative writing away from us,\" Hennen said. \"And I think that has to do with the fact that creative writing is — it's a business, but it's also an art, and arts are imperfect; we do them for human reasons that are not just to make money.\"\n\nShe said that their program has been growing over the last two to three years.\n\n\"I would say we're starting to see trends that look really promising for students starting to ask, 'Can the humanities sustain me at a time when everything is moving so quickly?'\" Rivera, the dean at the University of Colorado Boulder, said. Those students \"really want to reflect what it means to be part of a technological world.\"\n\nThat's also the case at Rice University in Houston, where enrollment in English classes has grown steadily over the last few years and the number of faculty within Creative Writing has nearly doubled, according to Kathleen Canning, the dean of humanities and arts.\n\nOne example of an assignment is an English professor who will issue an essay prompt and ask students to compare their own version to one they get from an LLM, and analyze the difference between the two. The aim is to examine what it means to be an interpreter of a prompt — and the power of their own words.\n\n\"Students are trying to ascertain how to develop and advance their own capacities while AI appears to do so much for them in these times,\" Canning said. \"The humanities and arts offer them opportunities not only to probe the limits of AI, to grapple with it as an increasingly powerful reality, but to do so critically by advancing their capacities for self-reflection, interpretation, and revision.\"\n\nDespite these examples, schools across the country are paring back on their humanities offerings or cutting programs completely, and the nationwide number of humanities bachelor's degrees being conferred has fallen from 2010s highs in recent years.\n\nStill, students pursue English out of passion, said Kevin Caffrey, a senior associate registrar at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. His research found that English majors who participated in his survey \"illustrated that even with a strong overall awareness of criticisms of the major, they were determined to enroll in the program because it aligned with their interests, personal ideals, and goals for the future.\"\n\n\"What do you need more in a company than someone who knows how to communicate with people at all different levels from all different backgrounds and walks of life? The English majors are primed to do that,\" Caffrey said.\n\nThey're learning to do it as communication changes rapidly. When 23-year-old Margo D. returned from a semester abroad, she noticed something had shifted on campus.\n\n\"Many of my peers were using ChatGPT for almost every assignment,\" Margo, who graduated from a small liberal arts school in 2025 with a double major in English and Earth and Climate Sciences, said. Margo wasn't sold.\n\n\"I noticed that my English professors were asking a lot out of my writing, asking for a lot of creativity and an original voice and style, and asking me questions that AI couldn't necessarily grasp the nuance of, and I don't really think it even can now,\" Margo said. \"And so I felt really grateful to be an English major.\"\n\nThere are signs of employment hope for the English majors.\n\nDaniela Amodei, the cofounder of Anthropic, studied literature in college. In an ABC News interview, she said \"the things that make us human will become much more important,\" and that when her AI company hires, it looks for candidates who are great communicators.\n\n\"I actually think studying the humanities is going to be more important than ever,\" Amodei said.\n\nSteve Johnson, the editorial director of NotebookLM, previously told Business Insider that there's what he's deemed a \"revenge of the humanities.\" Philosophical thinking is necessary; some AI firms are even actively seeking out liberal arts graduates.\n\nStill, companies aren't falling over themselves to snap up English majors — hiring overall has slowed to one of the lowest rates in over a decade, and the recent grad unemployment rate has been ticking up.\n\nEarly-career humanities and arts graduates had a higher unemployment rate than their peers in other fields, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's American Community Survey by Georgetown researchers.\n\nJoe Kramer, a 2020 English graduate, hasn't worked directly in a related field since he graduated — he worked in a role that relied on automation, and even helped train AI while searching for post-pandemic work.\n\n\"I think it's just getting really scary out there for a lot of humanities adjacent stuff, because the level of AI that's out there now, it generates pictures, it crawls all kinds of web forums, and it can oversee thousands of pages and documents at a time while only being run by one person,\" Kramer said. \"So even if AI isn't taking your job, they don't need to hire a lot of people anymore.\"\n\nPart of some of the general reticence to hire in hiring right now can also be chalked up to an equal-opportunity dismal labor market. It's not just English majors suffering.\n\nUnder the hood, the prospects for English majors aren't as dreary, according to the Georgetown analysis. The unemployment rate for those specifically in humanities and liberal arts is still well below the post-2008 Great Recession highs, although it's still higher than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nKorn Ferry's Ackermann said that it's still a \"tad early\" to fully declare a revenge of the English major, since it's smaller, more nimble firms looking for those with a good command of language, but he predicts that could expand to bigger employers soon.\n\n\"Ask me again in a couple of months, and we're going to see that go from smaller, nimble organizations into the larger enterprises as the larger enterprises begin to incorporate AI-driven development tools into their processes,\" he said.\n\nGiancarlo Hirsch, a managing director at global tech talent partner Glocomms, said he's seen greater willingness to look at candidates from various backgrounds. Candidates with history backgrounds, for example, are making it further into interview processes than they previously would.\n\n\"People are not explicitly targeting folks from humanities degrees, but they're really willing to speak with them and open to it and finding reasons to say yes throughout an interview process,\" Hirsch said.\n\nDaniella LaGaccia, a 37-year-old copywriter and former English literature major, sees AI as a tool — creatives use all sorts of different tools to complement their work, and AI can be one of them. But, if anything, that makes a greater case for the type of creative thinking and knowledge that humanities majors can bring.\n\n\"Think about it this way: If you have five different companies who are using the same generative tools to develop their marketing copy, they're all going to get generally the same type of thing,\" LaGaccia said. \"If everybody's using the same tools and everybody's inputting the same information, then how are you going to differentiate yourself in the market? That's where creative people come in.\"",

    "description": "A typical job search now lasts almost three months. Many Americans aren't financially prepared for that.",
    "fullText": "Job searches are taking longer, and some Americans' savings aren't keeping up.\n\nAt one point, during Michele Wilke's post-layoff job search, she had less than $2,000 in her bank account — and was worried about being evicted from her studio apartment in Chicago.\n\nTo stay afloat, Wilke launched a GoFundMe that raised nearly $3,000 and borrowed money from friends, eventually accumulating more than $20,000 in personal debt. Last September, after eight months of searching, she landed a catering sales manager role.\n\n\"My goal is to make some money and pay off my debt,\" said Wilke, who's in her 60s. \"I want a fresh start.\"\n\nWilke's experience underscores how quickly a prolonged job search can unravel someone's finances — especially for workers without much savings to fall back on. Nearly half of Americans don't have three months' worth of expenses set aside in an emergency or \"rainy day\" fund, according to the latest Federal Reserve survey data from 2024.\n\nThose facing joblessness are in an ever-more precarious position; the typical unemployment stint is getting longer as US companies are hiring at one of the lowest rates since 2013. At the same time — though inflation has eased — costs for housing, food, and other essentials are squeezing household budgets.\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with dozens of laid-off workers. Many were surprised not just by the layoffs themselves, but by how difficult the job market they entered proved to be. Some have since felt significant financial strain, including several who had built emergency savings.\n\n\"Even with a job, it'll take a lot to climb out of my financial hole,\" Wilke said.\n\nAs unemployment spells lengthen, the financial risks of a prolonged job search are rising for many Americans.\n\nThe median unemployment duration for US job seekers was over 11 weeks (nearly three months) as of January, up from as low as eight weeks in 2022. Some job seekers are having an even harder time: As of January, a quarter of unemployed Americans had been looking for work for 27 weeks (nearly seven months) or more, up from below 18% in 2023.\n\nThe typical jobless period in 2026 could weigh on many Americans' finances. Fifty-five percent of US adults said they had set aside money to cover at least three months of expenses in an emergency fund, according to Federal Reserve survey data. That leaves 45 percent without a dedicated three-month cushion.\n\nAmong adults who reported not having a three-month cushion, some said they could cover expenses by borrowing, selling assets, or drawing on other savings — but the majority said they would be unable to cover that amount by any method.\n\nWhile layoffs remain low by historical standards, an uptick could leave many Americans struggling to cover expenses — even if severance or unemployment benefits offer temporary relief.\n\nWhen Clair Todd was laid off from her site reliability engineer role at Oracle in November 2023, she was initially optimistic about her job prospects. More than two years later, she was still looking for work.\n\nWhen Todd made a mid-career pivot to tech, family members who worked in the industry warned her that layoffs were fairly common. So she made an effort to build a \"just-in-case\" savings fund over the years.\n\nThat fund, along with her severance pay and unemployment benefits, helped her stay afloat initially. But after going through more than $50,000 in savings, she's found herself in a tougher financial position.\n\nTodd said she's managed to cover her mortgage and student-loan payments by dipping further into savings or selling stocks. Her only source of income is between $500 and $1,000 a month reselling antiques she finds and refurbishes — including old instruments, electronics, and collectibles purchased on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist.\n\n\"When my washer and dryer broke last year, I had to buy a new set on a payment plan — something I'd never done before,\" said Todd, who's in her 40s and lives in New Hampshire. \"In the past, I would've just paid for it outright.\"\n\nLast year, Todd decided to scale back her job hunt and began focusing on launching a website development business.\n\n\"I don't want to say I've given up, but my search has been extremely discouraging,\" she said.\n\nJoanelle Cobos is earlier in her job search, but she's bracing for a prolonged period of unemployment.\n\nWhen she started at Amazon as a design manager in 2021, she had just spent nine months unemployed, which had taken a toll on her finances. Determined not to be caught off guard again, she set out to build a financial buffer against another potential layoff.\n\n\"I'd started planning my life around the possibility of losing my job,\" said Cobos, who's in her 30s and lives in Las Vegas.\n\n\"My job search feels like a ticking time bomb,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Getting laid off can be frightening. Knowing how to respond if it happens can take away some of the fear, especially as large companies continue to cut workers.\n\nFirst off, it's worth considering that right after it happens, you'll likely be in shock. That's why it might not be wise to sign forms your employer might give you — at least not before taking time to review them with a clear head. You need to process what has occurred.\n\nOnce you do that, you'll be able to start your search for a new role. It's best to treat the hunt like, well, a job. That doesn't mean applying to everything you see; it just means having a plan.\n\nThat's in part because the average unemployment in the US as of January 2026 lasted about 5.5 months, according to Labor Department data. Naturally, that varies by industry and role. Some job seekers report that it's taken them far longer.\n\n\"I wouldn't dillydally in a market like this, because it can take a long time,\" Jennifer Schielke, the CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions, told Business Insider. \"Get into the rhythm that you're used to in the workplace.\"\n\nHere are three steps you'll want to consider taking following a layoff:\n\nAs you process what you've gone through, think about your goals, said former recruiter Mike Peditto.\n\n\"In stressful situations, your panicked reaction is almost never as good as the decision you make after reflection, processing, and intention-setting,\" he told Business Insider. That said, everyone's timeout might look different.\n\n\"Some people take a month off to travel, and that's great, but most people don't have that cushion. Take whatever you can,\" he said.\n\nIt's important to assess your situation. That means considering the health of your industry, but also your own. The search process can be lonely, so you might consider joining a support group for laid-off workers.\n\nYou might also want to consider how you can invest in yourself. That's especially important as AI threatens to upend an array of roles, especially for desk workers. Adding to your AI skills can make you more attractive to employers. Rather than prohibiting the technology in the interview process, some employers are now incorporating AI into how they assess job applicants to ensure their skills are up to date.\n\nEven though the job market can make it feel unreasonable to be choosy, it's worth reflecting on what you want from your next position.\n\nIt's also worth looking at what roles and industries are growing; they might provide opportunities.\n\nTaking practical steps can help you feel like you're reasserting control during what's often an uncertain time.\n\nFirst, collect the severance paperwork your employer gave you. Ask any questions you might have. Take time to review the documents, and don't forget that severance is sometimes negotiable.\n\nIt's also important to apply for unemployment benefits right away, because those can take a while to process. You might also need to figure out how to handle any stock options, think about what to do with your 401(k), and how long your health insurance or COBRA coverage will last.\n\nIt's also a good time to examine your spending and, if you haven't, craft a budget. There are numerous financial survival tips after a layoff, including canceling any unnecessary subscriptions and seeing whether you can get price breaks on your phone and internet bills.\n\nYou might get that ick feeling thinking of yourself as a brand, but, however you frame it, the reputation you've built through your work history and other interactions matters. It's a good time to reexamine your LinkedIn profile, add an \"open to work\" banner to attract recruiters, and let your connections know about your new status by drafting a layoff message.\n\nIf you've kept your résumé up to date, well done. In any case, you'll probably want to tweak it now. Focus on your skills, accomplishments, and impact, rather than just job titles.\n\nOnce you've done that, you can start reaching out to your network. Maybe set up some coffees or quick chats with connections, because that's often far more effective than panic-applying — what recruiters sometimes call \"spray and pray\" — to every job posting you find. Now is a good time to make a list of employers you want to target.\n\nGive some thought to how you will talk about your layoff in interviews. Consider what employers are after. One CEO who had 800 applications for a role told Business Insider why three stood out.\n\nYou might be fortunate enough to use your layoff as a chance to take bold steps — like negotiating for higher pay or better benefits in your next role.\n\nHave you been through a layoff? What made the difference when embarking on a job hunt? Business Insider would like to hear about your experience. Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "The world of warehouse retail has two top titans: Costco and Sam's Club.\n\nThe chains have a lot in common.\n\nIndeed, they each trace their roots to Sol Price, who mentored a Costco cofounder and inspired Walmart's Sam Walton to launch his own version of the concept.\n\nBoth clubs charge an annual membership fee ($65 at Costco, $50 at Sam's) that allows shoppers to peruse spartan aisles stacked with pallets of bulk-packaged goods at bargain prices.\n\nAnother similarity is that each one carries products under their own in-house labels, Kirkland Signature at Costco, and Member's Mark at Sam's.\n\nAnd these private-label offerings have earned loyal followings among their customers.\n\nTo find out which side offers the best value, we visited locations in Wisconsin to compare prices on a dozen common household items.\n\nWe focused on functionally similar products, though some exact matches were not available.\n\nIn general, we found Costco had a broader selection in its Kirkland line. Of 17 Kirkland items we looked at, we found appropriate matches for only 12 from Member's Mark.\n\nOn the other hand, Member's Mark included a few more economical options. For example, Kirkland Signature sometimes offered only an organic option, which was often more expensive.\n\nAfter adjusting for pack size, the 12 items from Sam's Club totaled $150, while the Costco products totaled $158.\n\nHere's how each item contributed to the cart totals.\n\nCostco's bulk sugar option is organic cane sugar, priced at $12 for a 10-pound bag. Member's Mark offers similar-sized bags of white granulated sugar for less than $7.28 — a savings of nearly $5. (If you need 10 pounds of sugar, that is.)\n\nMember's Mark laundry detergent sells for about $3 less per jug than the comparable Kirkland Signature option.\n\nAs with sugar, the Costco option is organic, about $2 more than these Member's Mark nuggets at Sam's Club.\n\nA dozen boxes of Kirkland Signature facial tissue cost $1 more than the same quantity of Member's Mark facial tissue.\n\nKirkland Signature sharp cheddar cheese costs $0.24 more than the Member's Mark colby jack cheese. Since they are technically different styles of cheese and within 5% of each other on price, we're calling this a tie.\n\nThe Member's Mark acetaminophen is about $0.50 cheaper than the Kirkland Signature version, but that is less than a 4% difference in the total.\n\nEither way, both options cost about half as much per gel cap as Tylenol.\n\nThis Kirkland Signature dish soap is $0.089 per ounce, a tenth of a penny less than the unit price of the Member's Mark option. That works out to an $0.11 advantage to Costco.\n\nAllergy meds are among the most cost-effective products to buy from a warehouse club's private-label brand.\n\nThe Kirkland Signature version of Zyrtec costs a fraction of a cent less per tablet than Member's Mark, but both of those are about 89% less than the name-brand option.\n\nKirkland Signature and Member's Mark have similar nutty snack bars to those sold by Kind. After adjusting for pack size, the Costco option is about $0.50 less than Sam's Club, but that's still less than a 5% difference in price.\n\nA Kirkland Signature battery costs $0.35, while a similar Member's Mark battery is $0.02 more, or about 5.5%.\n\n40-packs of bottled water cost $0.30 less at Costco than at Sam's Club. That's a seemingly small number, but it works out to a price difference of nearly 7%.\n\nBoth clubs sell their own versions of Colombian Supremo beans. The Kirkland Signature price is about $0.64 per pound less than the Member's Mark price. That's a savings of about 8%.\n\nBoth options are less expensive than the beans available at the warehouses from Starbucks.",

    "description": "The US economy grew 2.2% in 2025 while job creation stalled, exacerbating inequality in a \"K-shaped economy\" scenario.",
    "fullText": "The data is in, and last year presents an economic conundrum: Overall growth was relatively strong, but job growth was virtually nonexistent. It bodes ill for the gap between the rich and everyone else.\n\nNewly released data showed the US economy grew 2.2% in 2025. That's a respectable pace, although cooler than the past few years. Economic activity was affected by the record-long government shutdown in the fall, businesses figuring out how to handle trade announcements, and new investments.\n\nMeanwhile, the US added the fewest jobs since 2003 outside recessions. While unemployment stayed low, hiring and job openings fell, meaning plenty of people couldn't find a job. It's an unfortunate situation for new graduates looking to get on the first rung of the career ladder, job switchers eager for a fresh opportunity, and basically anyone looking to land a job quickly outside the in-demand healthcare and social assistance sectors.\n\nThe divide between output and jobs is widening another divide: some call it a \"K-shaped economy\" where the rich are earning and spending more, while everyone else is stagnating. And it doesn't look like 2026 will be much better.\n\n\"Consumers are feeling the weight of the price increases, and combined with the jobs outlook that's worsening they say, 'OK, when I look out, I don't see prices going down that much, but I do see my wage is not growing and my job not being as reliable or secure as it once was,'\" Atsi Sheth, the chief credit officer at Moody's Ratings, told Business Insider.\n\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian said in a Financial Times opinion piece before the newest GDP figures that while this \"decoupling of job growth from economic growth\" has happened before in the US, it's typically occurred during recession recoveries and \"not in the midst of a prolonged period of robust growth such as the one we are experiencing today.\"\n\n\"We're in this unusual environment where economic activity has remained quite robust, and yet job gains have fallen to near zero,\" Gregory Daco, the chief economist at EY, told Business Insider.\n\nThe US added a measly 181,000 jobs last year; annual figures are often at least a million. It's comparable to 2003, when the US only added 124,000 jobs in the wake of the 2001 recession.\n\nDaco said GDP's strength is \"masking a growing bifurcation\" and thinks the polarization will persist and maybe worsen because supply shocks, such as trade and tax policies, AI, and demographic changes, aren't reversing.\n\n\"In some cases, we're seeing a more significant effect on economic activity,\" Daco said.\n\nSome economic experts are optimistic about the year ahead. \"We expect a strong year of economic growth in 2026, driven by business investment, consumer spending and fading trade headwinds,\" said Rick Gardner, chief investment officer of RGA Investments. ZipRecruiter economist Nicole Bachaud thinks the job market could be at a \"pivot point\" after stronger hiring in January.\n\n\"Demand in other sectors that are more cyclically based instead of demographically based is starting somewhat to show signs of growth,\" Bachaud said.\n\nThe strength in the economy isn't being felt by all. People at the top are feeling much better than pretty much everyone else. They don't have to worry as much about rising prices of necessities and slowing wage growth.\n\n\"The wealthier, more affluent consumers are benefiting from wealth accumulation, allowing them to still spend relatively freely,\" Daco said. \"They're also enjoying faster wage growth, while lower-income families are seeing reduced wage growth, near-zero real wage growth, and not much wealth appreciation outside of real estate, if they have that.\"\n\nSheth said the benefits of GDP growth have been higher for those who earn from investments and capital gains. \"They've benefited a lot from financial market booms, whereas those who earn their income primarily by wages have benefited some, but not as much,\" she said.\n\nDiane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, told Business Insider that \"What productivity growth we've seen since basically the turn of the century has accrued mostly to the owners of capital, not rank and file workers. And that means we've seen wealth compound, but also income inequality worsen.\"\n\nSheth said regardless of how people refer to the disconnect happening in the economy, the \"real trouble\" is that wages are no longer keeping up with the rising cost of living and that people are having to pay a lot more to buy essentials.\n\nSwonk said inflation is \"the most regressive tax\" because of how much lower-income households have to spend on necessities relative to their earnings.\n\n\"When those goods go up in price, obviously that affects them even harder, and so it's a very regressive tax,\" Swonk said, adding, \"Oftentimes, we lose sight of the fact that it really is the level of prices that people are still reacting to.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report that inflation-adjusted consumer spending has increased for high-income households since 2023, but low-income household spending has mostly trended down. \"The trend since 2023 is different from the trend during the pandemic recession and recovery, when consumption growth was similar across income groups,\" the report said.\n\nAmid those price increases and changes to spending habits, wage growth has drastically cooled for lower earners. Lower-income wage growth surged between 2021 and 2022, but has since cooled down a lot from the late 2022 peak. Sheth also pointed out that wage growth for hourly workers, who she said are likely \"subject to much more fluctuation and downside risk than if you have a steady salary,\" has also been falling faster than those not paid hourly.\n\nSheth said another issue is that the lower end of the wage spectrum is under more credit stress.\n\n\"We're seeing greater credit stress in subprime auto, for instance, some parts of borrowing, but again at the lower end of the spectrum,\" Sheth said. \"But overall, if you compare household balance sheets today to, say, the pre-global financial crisis era, they're generally stronger — much stronger at middle- and upper-income levels, of course, but generally stronger.\"\n\nEl-Erian said in the Financial Times piece that, \"This period of decoupling of employment from growth may prove more persistent and more consequential,\" partly because the effects of AI are still unfolding.\n\nAI-related investments have already made a dent in real GDP growth based on findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"As firms continue integrating AI into their operations and building the infrastructure required to support it, these categories are likely to remain significant drivers of investment well into 2026 and beyond,\" the authors wrote.\n\nLaura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, described a \"precarious balance\" between GDP and the job market. Ullrich is unsure whether employers will decide they should hire more to keep up with the relatively robust economic growth or make job cuts because they aren't keeping up.\n\n\"I do think the uncertainty about the role AI plays adds in another interesting pivot,\" Ullrich said. \"Because if AI is able to take on the work of humans, then we could see economic growth without hiring picking up much. But, I'm skeptical that that's happening in big ways right this second.\"\n\nAside from the impact of AI, the US doesn't need as many jobs to hold unemployment stable at a time when the population isn't growing as quickly, so it's possible job growth continues to be lower than previously experienced.\n\n\"The low-hire, low-fire job market isn't just about policy changes in the new administration or about AI,\" Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Business Insider. \"So, there may not be a quick fix.\"\n\n\"While participants generally assessed that, under appropriate monetary policy, the labor market likely would stabilize and then improve this year, they continued to note that the outlook for the labor market remained uncertain,\" minutes from the January Federal Reserve meeting said.",

    "description": "When a startup founder allowed an employee's dog to start coming to the office, she had no idea he would become their biggest productivity hack.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sophia Kianni, a 24-year-old startup founder based in New York City. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen my startup was raising $35 million in Series A funding, it was naturally a very intense period for our company. We were heads down, with everyone coming to the office early and leaving very late, five to six days a week.\n\nComing out of that time, one of our team members brought her dog, Ollie, to the office, and he kind of became our secret productivity hack.\n\nNow he comes in most days of the week, and it truly feels like we have an office dog. Culture is everything at an early-stage startup, and Ollie helps us foster an environment of people who are excited to do their work.\n\nHe's even helping us with hiring.\n\nI launched my commerce startup, Phia, two years ago with my roommate at Stanford. We're using AI to match users with products aligned to their preferences across various brands.\n\nOur office is based in Union Square in New York City. For the past year, our team of about 10 was working out of a 17th-floor office that we loved. As we completed our Series A funding round and expanded our team, we decided to rent the office on the floor below ours, with a staircase linking the two areas.\n\nI call our new floor the hacker lounge because it's where our engineers work and has a more casual, industrial vibe, with a common space to roam. That's where Ollie, our Shiba Inu office dog, hangs out. Anyone who wants to be around Ollie can come down to the lower level; otherwise, they can stay on the top level.\n\nOur team member who owns Ollie is fully in charge of him at the office, including his food, water, and bathroom breaks.\n\nThe bottom floor's layout is weirdly perfect for a dog. There's a tiny office space with only one desk where we keep his dog bed and food bowl, so when our teammate needs to go heads down to work on something like financial modeling, he can hang out in there.\n\nThe rest of the space has a large open concept in the middle where he can just roam around where he wants to. While he stays in the hacker lounge downstairs because of the space, our upstairs office stays much more buttoned up and professional.\n\nAs an early-stage startup, we have a level of intensity and grind culture, but we want to make sure our office environment still feels collaborative, kind, and inviting. I feel like that's exactly what a dog helps facilitate.\n\nWith Ollie around, we can laugh and talk with other people on our team while playing fetch. Having an office dog makes the atmosphere so much lighter and encourages us to spend that time together.\n\nIt's also so motivating and exciting knowing that if I'm staying late at the office, at least there's a delightful dog to cheer me up.\n\nIn the past, when I needed a break while working on something intense or time-consuming like an important deck, I'd leave the building to take a walk and clear my head. However, it was a time-consuming process.\n\nNow I can access that same mental reset by petting Ollie or having a lighthearted moment around him with my teammates. Then I can easily resume the task I was focused on with a fresh perspective.\n\nI think those refreshing moments with Ollie put us in a better mood, so we're able to stay at the office longer and be productive for a longer period of time.\n\nWe're trying to grow our team, so we've been making a lot of content tailored toward hiring recently. I feel like showcasing Ollie in our content has been a great way to showcase our work culture and attract the type of people we're looking for.\n\nOf course, we want to work with someone who is extremely high IQ and high agency, but we also want someone nice, fun, kind, delightful — the type of person who might be attracted to the idea of an office dog.\n\nWe'll make content saying, \"If you want to come and play with Ollie, you should apply to Phia\", and it's been a great hiring funnel. We recently got an email from someone with the subject line \"I want to say hi to Ollie,\" and it was a pitch to work for us.\n\nI don't have any frustrations with having an office dog. He fits perfectly in our space. When we have people come to our office, like investors, we have them go to our conference room.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting an office dog, make sure you have the right space to fit them in. If you have the facilities to have a dog, I would 100% recommend it.\n\nDo you have a story to share about a unique productivity hack? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

Trump's new Project Vault could be a sign of more volatility to come.\n\nThe Trump administration's new critical mineral reserve is meant to secure supply and protect from major price moves, but experts have raised concerns that the reality is that it could ratchet up volatility and be a fresh input for more inflation.\n\nTrump announced Project Vault on February 2, establishing the US Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve.\n\n\"Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defense, we are now creating this reserve for American industry,\" Trump read in an Oval Office announcement.\n\nThe $12 billion reserve is funded by a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States and $2 billion in private financing.\n\n\"This is the first time in the history of the United States we've ever stockpiled minerals for our civilian economy,\" David Copley, a White House official, said.\n\nGE Vernova, Western Digital, and Boeing are some of the private companies expected to participate in the project.\n\nProject Vault may pose some risk to the commodity market, but the details remain unclear, and that makes pricing in the risk more difficult for investors.\n\nFGS Global strategists noted that the implementation details are \"critical,\" especially given Trump's tariff policy and ongoing trade negotiations.\n\n\"Project Vault's top-line priority — fostering the resilience of critical minerals supply chains — is open to several competing interpretations, each with radically different approaches,\" partners at Latham & Watkins said.\n\n\"This is essentially about taking steps to redesign the market architecture for critical minerals,\" international trade lawyer Sahar Hafeez said. \"Which minerals are prioritized, how a price floor is calculated, and who signs on—those are the critical next steps.\"\n\nThe Project Vault reserve is expected to impact on supply and demand dynamics and commodity price moves.\n\nJefferies' analyst, Chris LaFemina, said Project Vault's planned reserve would represent only 1% to 3% of global supply, but flags that stockpiling the US is one of many global powers stockpiling, which threatens to fuel inflationary pressures for commodities and the materials sector.\n\nThe analyst highlighted that the $12 billion reserve, unlike the existing oil preserve Trump compared it to, will cost roughly $1 billion annually to maintain. He says this ultimately pushes prices higher, which is felt by consumers in the end.\n\n\"So is it inflationary? I mean, look, inflation is driven by a lot of different factors, but this, in and of itself, I think, could potentially become a major inflationary problem,\" LaFemina said in a video posted by the firm this month.\n\nLaFemina expects that the recent upward trend in metals will continue, along with \"significant\" volatility.\n\nGoldman pointed out that Trump's policies shift commodity markets supply-demand balance to be regionally segmented rather than globally, creating a heightened volatility risk.\n\nThey flagged copper as an early example, explaining that prices firmed despite volatility in 2025, as US stockpiling left the rest of the market in deficit amid global oversupply.\n\nThe reserve comes during the Trump administration's efforts to turbocharge the American manufacturing industry and reduce economic reliance on China.\n\nCommodities like silver, copper, and platinum, some of the 60 USGS critical minerals, have seen dramatic price moves recently. Project Vault is intended to insulate American firms from this volatility and safeguard US interests by reducing reliance on China.\n\nCritical minerals, specifically rare earth minerals, have been a key sticking point of US-China trade talks. China is a dominant player at every stage of the critical minerals industry, from mining to refining, meaning it has a lot of control over pricing.\n\nGoldman Sachs believes that Project Vault's stockpiling will focus on these rare earth minerals.\n\nTrade negotiations and unclear supply sourcing are among the other uncertainties that could feed market volatility.\n\nFGS Global strategists said some of the tariffs expected from the administration may \"amplify commodity price volatility,\" adding that the ongoing trade negotiations could stand in the way of a regional critical mineral deal. Trade talks between the US, Mexico, and Canada are set to conclude in July.\n\nAnother consideration is China could restrict supply in response to the US' plans to stockpile. The Trump administration hasn't explained sourcing plans.\n\nJefferies lead metals and mining analyst, LaFemina, said.\n\n\"Sourcing remains unclear, in the interim the US may have to buy from suppliers it's trying to avoid (ie. China).\"",

    "description": "The Marines' top Sergeant Major wants companies to start hiring more troops before they leave the military.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps' top enlisted leader wants government agencies and civilian companies to start recruiting Marines for new jobs long before troops leave the military, arguing that delays in hiring can leave veterans vulnerable at a critical moment.\n\nSpeaking during a congressional hearing on service member quality of life last week, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps Carlos Ruiz said he wants to see agencies such as the Secret Service, as well as industries like shipbuilding and emergency responders, begin hiring processes up to a year before Marines separate.\n\n\"The in-between time when the paychecks run out, when the medical gets expensive and life hits them, I worry,\" Ruiz told lawmakers, referring broadly to data showing veterans are often most vulnerable to mental health issues soon after leaving the military. \"Build a pipeline where a Marine can go straight from the last day of active duty to your school,\" he said, referring to employee training. \"Eliminate the barriers.\"\n\nEach year, around 200,000 service members leave active duty, first attending the congressionally mandated Transition Readiness Program, designed to help troops learn how to apply for civilian jobs or universities. About 14% of those transitioning are Marines.\n\nPrevious oversight reports have found consistent shortfalls with that program. A 2023 government watchdog report found that a quarter of troops who needed the most transition support never received it, and 70% did not begin the process a year before separation, leaving many scrambling for civilian opportunities.\n\n\"That's the thing that I think is maybe the source of a downhill spiral towards negativity,\" Ruiz explained to Business Insider in a video interview after the hearing, linking delayed employment to broader mental health concerns.\n\nWhile many Marines transition successfully, others struggle. Some studies estimate that more than 40% of veterans leave their first post-military job within a year. The VA's latest suicide report shows veterans from the Corps, where tight-knit camaraderie is prized, face the highest risk of suicide within a year of exiting relative to other services.\n\nRuiz argued that speeding up and smoothing the hiring process could help reduce that early instability.\n\nFor example, he said, the Secret Service can have an 18-month application period for applicants, even as the agency works to expand its ranks amid an injection of cash.\n\n\"You want Marines. I want you to have Marines. You got to come to the left,\" Ruiz said, referring to a quicker hiring timeline. He recalled a conversation with Secret Service director Sean Curran last month. \"I will give you access to them throughout the years that they're in the Marine Corps, so we can move that date to the left, so they can transition straight in.'\n\n\"That's a lot of time in between for life to happen,\" Ruiz said.\n\nThe Secret Service is trying to shorten its lengthy hiring process by condensing qualifying events — like polygraphs and various exams — for applicants, Nate Herring, an agency spokesperson, said in an email to Business Insider. Herring cited an aggressive push to recruit more veterans and reduce hiring bureaucracy, too, in some cases cutting the process by six months.\n\nRather than waiting until Marines exit active duty to begin lengthy application processes and hit unexpected chokepoints, Ruiz wants employers to move hiring timelines sooner, starting any additional background checks, interviews, and paperwork during a Marine's final year of service, including while deployed.\n\nSuch a shift would require buy-in from the service's middle-management ranks, who may be reluctant to let subordinates spend more time on job searches, a challenge not usually well-understood throughout the active ranks, though often felt by those leaving.\n\nA 2020 Department of Veterans Affairs report found that \"many veterans did not understand the magnitude of the issues they might face when transitioning to civilian life.\"\n\nRuiz also floated the idea of formal partnerships between the Marine Corps and private-sector employers, including Big Tech companies, from the time a recruit enters the Corps, that would guarantee job placement for selected Marines upon completing their enlistment, provided they meet agreed-upon benchmarks.\n\nSuch early partnerships could offer recruits and families greater career stability and more predictability. Many recruits already join the military planning to stay for one or two tours and use their service as an important stepping stone.\n\nShipbuilding, a priority industry for the Trump administration and one that is grappling with persistent workforce shortages and pay challenges, could also benefit from a more direct Marine-to-industry pipeline, Ruiz said.\n\n\"You want Marines, you want this kind of work ethic, you want this kind of passion,\" he said of similar industries. \"Then build the pipeline, build an incentive package that's worth their talents, and I think they'll come no matter where you are.\"\n\nSome career fields have programs in place already to help troops quickly land in suitable career fields. But those existing efforts, including those within the civilian sector, generally fall short.\n\n\"It's not good enough,\" he said. \"You're taking too long, and we can be better.\"",

    "fullText": "Your state's next governor might be a billionaire.\n\nBillionaires in both political parties are throwing their hats in the ring to be the next governor in three different states across the US, and some of them are spending their own fortunes to do so.\n\nDemocratic Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois is the sole billionaire serving as governor of a US state right now. But it's not that uncommon for billionaires to run for, and even win, their state's top office.\n\nBefore becoming Secretary of the Interior under President Donald Trump, billionaire Doug Burgum served for eight years as the governor of North Dakota. And before he was elected to the Senate in 2024, Republican coal magnate Jim Justice served as West Virginia's governor.\n\nPoliticians in America tend to be wealthy, and running for office is expensive. Billionaires and multi-millionaires often spend their own money to fund their campaigns, and sometimes they're recruited by party leaders specifically for that reason.\n\nHere's what to know about the billionaires running for governor in 2026.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer is a leading Democratic contender for governor of California in 2026.\n\nSteyer, a philanthropist and climate activist who also ran for president in 2020, made his fortune running the hedge fund Farallon Capital.\n\nHe is estimated to be worth $2 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHis gubernatorial campaign is almost entirely self-funded. He has poured at least $38 million of his own wealth into his campaign so far, according to recent disclosures.\n\nRecent polling has generally put Steyer in fifth place, landing behind GOP candidates Steve Hilton and Sheriff Chad Bianco, along with Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter.\n\nBillionaire Vivek Ramaswamy is the overwhelming favorite to be the GOP nominee for governor of Ohio in 2026.\n\nRamaswamy got rich in the biotech industry, and Forbes estimates his net worth to be $2.2 billion.\n\nHe rose to political prominence during the 2024 GOP presidential primary, when he poured over $30 million into his largely self-funded, long-shot campaign. He was later slated to be the co-head of DOGE, but ultimately left to launch his gubernatorial bid.\n\nUnlike his presidential bid, Ramaswamy is not self-funding this time, and he raised nearly $20 million in 2025 without contributing his own funds.\n\nHe is expected to face Democratic candidate Amy Acton, the former director of the state's Department of Health, in the November election.\n\nBillionaire Rick Jackson, the founder and CEO of Jackson Healthcare, is a leading contender for the GOP nomination in Georgia's 2026 gubernatorial election.\n\nHe entered the race in has pledged to spend $50 million on his campaign, a sum that's sure to shake up an already crowded field.\n\nOther major contenders in the GOP primary include Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger, Lieutenant Gov. Burt Jones, and state Attorney General Chris Carr. Trump has endorsed Jones.",

    "description": "A longtime HR pro says AI is making everyone's résumé look the same, when it can provide job seekers with so much more value.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Trent Cotton, an HR industry veteran who is head of talent-acquisition insights at recruiting-software company iCIMS. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAs someone who works in the talent space, I've lately noticed that many people think AI helps make their résumés look better. My response to that is: You know your AI agent is cheating on you, right? It's doing the same thing for everyone, so your effort to try to stand out is actually making you blend in.\n\nIt's OK to use an AI agent to improve your résumé, but instead of asking it to do a rewrite, which can introduce errors, prompt it to behave like an expert career coach. Have it analyze your résumé and ask you probing questions to help you further build out your experience profile.\n\nNext, ask the agent what roles you might qualify for based on your skill set. The results may include ones you didn't know about, so have it explain what those jobs involve. Sometimes you just need to get a different perspective.\n\nIn my job at iCIMS, I analyze millions of data points collected from our recruiting software. Each month, I take a look at a specific sector or hot topic and dive deep.\n\nOne thing I saw last year was a pretty decent increase in application volume in manufacturing. If I'm sitting in tech, manufacturing isn't the sector I'm thinking of, but manufacturing needs tech to do things like track what's coming in and out of warehouses. AI can provide that kind of insight — but only if you ask for it.\n\nSticking with this example, you want to ask the AI: What are some of the top manufacturing companies looking to hire tech talent, and for what kind of positions? Keep going down that rabbit hole to really understand what opportunities are out there.\n\nOnce you find job listings that interest you, plug the descriptions into your AI agent and tell it to start interviewing you. When I was in college, you always went through mock interviews. They would just be absolutely brutal with you, but they prepared you. I think we've skipped a couple of generations in doing that. AI can bring mock interviews back.\n\nTell the AI agent that you want the interviewer to be like someone with business savvy, such as Steven Bartlett from the podcast \"Diary of a CEO.\" But also say you want feedback from the likes of chef and TV personality Gordon Ramsay, because he's known for providing his employees with brutally honest, constructive feedback. Say you want a true grade about your interview performance and recommendations for ways you can get better.\n\nMost AI agents will say your answers are great if you don't give them a persona like that of Ramsay. The AI version of him is going to tell you the good, the bad, and the ugly, and you're going to be better off because of it.",

    "description": "NATO needs to use this time to prepare for a Russian resurgence in the Arctic, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Russian forces pulled from the Arctic to fight in Ukraine have suffered heavy losses on the battlefield, but NATO expects them to eventually rebuild, emerging as a \"dangerous\" challenge, a top Norwegian military official told Business Insider.\n\nVice Adm. Rune Andersen, chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters, said there is no \"clear and immediate military threat\" from Russia in the north right now. But, he warned, Moscow has plans to rebuild and expand their military once the fight in Ukraine ends.\n\n\"We are preparing for a more dangerous Russia,\" he said, adding that NATO needs to use this time well and make preparations.\n\nArctic security has become an important issue for the NATO alliance in recent years, as Western officials have grown increasingly concerned about Russia's expanded military footprint in the strategic region.\n\nNATO leadership has called for greater investment in Arctic defense to counter Russian — and, more recently, Chinese — activity. Allied countries are increasingly taking steps to strengthen their posture in the High North, including through new deterrence operations.\n\nDespite rising tensions between Russia and NATO, an Arctic conflict does not appear imminent, as Moscow remains focused on its war in Ukraine — a campaign that has come at tremendous cost.\n\nRussia has pulled most of its forces from the strategic Kola Peninsula — a large swath of territory near Finland and a hub for its military and nuclear power in the Arctic — and sent them to Ukraine, where a lot of their troops have been killed in combat, Andersen said.\n\n\"Russia is bogged down in Ukraine,\" he added.\n\nExperts at the RAND Corporation, a US global policy think tank, said in a report this week that Russia's decision to deploy resources from the High North to Ukraine has ultimately led to \"the hollowing out of the country's Arctic-capable ground units.\"\n\n\"The conclusion of hostilities in Ukraine would allow Russia to reinvest in its military posture in the High North,\" they said.\n\nRussia's Arctic force presence has long been a concern for countries like Norway, where the threat is directly at their doorstep.\n\nIn the 2000s, Russia began returning to some Soviet-era Arctic bases, refurbishing airstrips and reopening facilities that had been closed during or after the Cold War, and in the late 2010s, Moscow launched more active submarine deployments from the Kola Peninsula, Andersen said.\n\nRussia has also deployed missile defense systems, increased its aerial and maritime patrols, and ramped up its military exercises, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US think tank that tracks Arctic military activity.\n\nWhile Russia's Arctic forces have taken a beating in Ukraine, leaving it less prepared in the region, NATO military planners are still acutely aware that there is potential for conflict down the road and are prepping for such a scenario.\n\n\"We are now in a time where we have an opportunity to focus on strengthening ourselves,\" Andersen said.\n\nNATO allies are investing in technology and systems to help secure the Arctic, including additional surveillance capabilities, icebreakers, drones, satellites, and vehicles that can operate in the cold.\n\nAllies have also expanded their footprint and increased the scale of their exercises in the Arctic to familiarize soldiers with the harsh realities of fighting so far north, where temperatures can kill just as easily as the enemy, and supply lines are vast and fragmented.\n\nNext month, for instance, thousands of NATO troops will participate in the biennial Cold Response drills in northern Norway, which are designed to train soldiers for high-intensity combat operations in the Arctic. These would be crucial skills for Western forces if Russia eventually reinvests in its capabilities across the High North.\n\n\"You need to train here to be able to fight here,\" Andersen said. \"In practical terms, it is those troops who have that training and that equipment who are relevant in the Arctic.\"",

    "description": "My partner and I built an easy life together when we both worked from home. With my RTO mandate, we have to be more intentional with our relationship.",
    "fullText": "I hadn't always been a believer in working from home. When remote work first became part of my life, I resisted it. I missed the structure of an office, the separation between work and everything else. Home felt like the wrong setting for serious work.\n\nThen, slowly, it didn't. I found a rhythm I hadn't expected. Mornings became mine. I cooked real lunches. I thought more clearly.\n\nMore importantly, my girlfriend and I have been living together in London for a year, and we have built a life around being home together that feels chosen rather than forced. I've stopped seeing remote work as a compromise and started seeing it as the better version of my day.\n\nSo when the email came from work that said I'd have to return to office, it wasn't just a scheduling change. It was a disruption to something we had spent months building, a routine that had come to feel like the foundation of everything else.\n\nIt has only been a few weeks since the announcement, and already, almost nothing looks the same — especially my relationship.\n\nThe first thing we've had to confront was practical. Two people who both work from home occupy a shared space in a very specific way. That balance had taken time to calibrate. We had never sat down and designed it. It had just formed, organically, around our needs. The return-to-office policy exposed how deliberate that accidental life actually was.\n\nMy girlfriend still works remotely, so the shift hasn't been symmetrical. I now leave each morning to head into a version of London we rarely engaged with during the week — the commuter version, the structured version — while she stays inside the life we'd built together. That asymmetry requires more honest conversation than either of us expected.\n\nWe've had to redesign things we never explicitly designed in the first place. What do mornings look like now? Who handles what, and when? The small, invisible agreements that hold a shared life together suddenly need to be spoken out loud. That process, still ongoing after just a few weeks, has been more revealing than disruptive. But it has required real effort.\n\nThe financial reality surfaced quickly. Commuting to London isn't cheap, and the daily arithmetic of transport, lunches, and the small expenses that accumulate when you're out of the house adds up faster than expected. We had saved money by being home — on food, on travel, on the general inefficiency of city life when you're moving through it daily. That buffer has started to shrink almost immediately.\n\nBut the more significant cost has been time. The commute is carving hours out of the day that had previously been ours. Mornings that once felt spacious have become logistical, and evenings are now shortened. The long, unhurried romantic dinners that had been a quiet anchor in our week are starting to require more effort to protect. Time, it turns out, had been our most abundant resource when we were both at home. We hadn't noticed until it started running out.\n\nThere is also an energy cost that is harder to quantify. Offices are stimulating in ways that are both useful and exhausting. I now come home differently — more depleted, less present. After just a few weeks, my girlfriend has already noticed the shift before I fully named it myself. The version of me that walks through the door at the end of the day is not quite the same one that used to simply close the laptop and call it done.\n\nWhat surprised me most wasn't the logistics. It was how much our new relationship had quietly depended on proximity: a shared lunch, a passing conversation in the kitchen, the low-level awareness of each other that comes with being in the same space. Those things weren't dramatic, but their absence has been.\n\nWe are now trying to be more intentional. Dinners that used to happen naturally now need to be protected. Check-ins that once occurred organically require more deliberate effort. It isn't a strain exactly; it's a recalibration.\n\nThe return-to-office policy hasn't damaged anything between us. But it is revealing how much of our relationship had been built on the life we'd created around being home. Losing some of that structure forced us to be more conscious about what we actually wanted, and more honest about what we weren't willing to give up.\n\nWe have only been doing this for a few weeks. Something tells me the real adjustments are still ahead.",

It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWe started 10 years ago. We were out of college and wanted to solve a problem that we experienced ourselves. When you're a student, you don't have that many problems.\n\nWhen we were interns, we had a lot of expense reports, but we would lose receipts and lose money. When you're a student, you don't have much money. One of the first problems we wanted to solve was: Let's build a mobile app to save your receipts, a bit like Expensify.\n\nSlack released its first API at the time. Now, we could create a bot. That was our pitch to YC: This is a new thing called a Slack bot. During the interview, they installed the Slack bot, and it pinged everyone in the YC Slack. Everyone started to use it. We got in.\n\nIt was 2016. At the time, it was in Mountain View. Sam Altman was still a partner. We had some office hours with him.\n\nThe core principle remained the same, but everything felt way less streamlined and processed than it is today. For example, the dinners were way more family-style. There weren't any visible employees. Some of the partners were cooking sometimes. Paul Graham was there.\n\nWe still were 100 people total in the batch, which is probably 3x less than it is today. Everything was in-person. We came from France and rented a house. It was a big difference to be in Mountain View when you've never lived in the US, than when you already live in San Francisco, and you do YC for the second time.\n\nThe former company was bought two years ago by Coda, which was acquired by Grammarly. Then, I discovered vibe coding. I decided that Notion, Airtable, Coda, and Retool are going to be the incumbents, and that a new category of vibe-coding platforms are going to emerge.\n\nOne of the partners at YC is also a friend, Nicolas Dessaigne. He said, \"You should apply to YC.\" It was a big opportunity cost to leave the company that acquired me, and having something like YC is a bit reassuring.\n\nThe fundamentals are still the same. You still have to talk to users, code, and grow. You still have to grow every single week at a steady percentage growth. It was 5-10% at the time; today it's more like 10, 12, 15%.\n\nYou have more and more young founders. It's not something that happened in the past 10 years; it probably happened in the past two years. I was one of the old folks. It was also my second company. Many are first-time founders.\n\nI think it was already the case that you want young founders that don't know limits and don't have anything that would prevent them from thinking really big. With AI, it's the same thing.\n\nA constant debate that you have less when you're a first-time founder is: Should I ship this, or should I double-check it? As a younger, first-time founder, you might have less experience with technical depth because you might not have worked with bigger companies before. You say: Let's ship this.\n\nThe batch sizes don't feel that different. The interaction you have with your batch is through weekly dinners, group office hours, individual office hours, and Demo Day. You also have some workshops here and there. If you are 300 or 400 people in the batch, it doesn't change that much if you're in subgroups.\n\nSometimes there are events, like when Sam Altman comes to talk, or the CEO of Perplexity or Cursor, where you need to have the whole batch. But, it's conference style anyway. You have 400 people in a room, sure, but if it's 150 or 400, it's the same.\n\nThe themes changed a lot, obviously. It was a lot of mobile apps and cloud. Today, it's a lot of AI. The brand of YC helps a lot. The brand is probably 10x better today than it was 10 years ago.\n\nDemo Day was way more important at the time than it is today. It feels more like an anchor date. It gives urgency to investors: if you don't invest in the hot startups now, they will meet with thousands of investors two weeks from now, and you might just lose your opportunity.\n\nGood investors all invest before Demo Day. It's just an anchor date to create a timeline for the investor and the startup.\n\nIf you ask me: Are you happy that you went back to YC? The answer is super straightforward. It's 100% yes.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, three reporters from our data centers investigation preview the themes they're watching this year.",
    "fullText": "The data center boom crept up on America, and we were ready. Business Insider jumped on the topic nearly two years ago, and this past week we won a George Polk Award for our work, which included a first-of-its-kind interactive map of data centers across the country and a riveting video showing their impact.\n\nWe checked in with lead journalists on the package to get their take on what to watch in data centers this year.\n\nHannah Beckler, data centers' use of water and electricity to produce computing power for AI was a big part of your work. Looking ahead, what are the biggest concerns on that front?\n\nSo many questions remain: Will tech companies uphold commitments some have made to pay for grid infrastructure buildout? Will novel strategies to generate power on-site at data centers alleviate spiking electricity bills? Even if they do, would such an approach damage air quality? And how will communities safeguard precious and often finite drinking water as thirsty data centers are built nearby?\n\nDakin Campbell, the market loves the AI boom but also periodically signals a limited appetite for the massive spending to build these data centers. What are the key concerns on Wall Street right now?\n\nFrom my conversations with bankers and others in the financing game, Wall Street has two, maybe three, big questions.\n\nOne, how worried should we be about the circular deals in which the likes of Nvidia invest in the AI labs that then buy Nvidia chips? These deals may be boosting the market in a way that isn't sustainable.\n\nTwo, many of these data center deals are backstopped by Big Tech companies, which are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to build out data centers — spending that eventually needs to be made back. Any meaningful decline in the perceived creditworthiness of these companies could weigh on credit markets more broadly.\n\nAnd three, what is the state of bottlenecks in power, gas turbines, memory chips, and other inputs, and how might that slow construction? Time is money, and the longer it takes to build the data centers, the more expensive it's going to be.\n\nRobert Leslie, what do you plan to look into with satellite imagery?\n\nNewly released satellite imagery clearly shows the trends in data center build-out across the US. We hope to study the speed of construction as well as the size of data centers.\n\nWe can already see how vast some of these gigawatt-scale sites are, with Meta's \"Hyperion\" in Louisiana set to be larger than Central Park. High-resolution satellite images can also provide clues to help us calculate a data center's overall power usage.\n\nGiven the scale of these projects, I'm also looking into the impact these vast server factories are having on rural communities.\n\nThanks everyone!

    "title": "What goes into a $75,000 a year kindergarten? Breaking down the cost of New York City private schools.",
    "description": "Kindergarten at one New York City private school will top $75,000 next year. Here's why it's so expensive.",
    "fullText": "$75,300 can buy you a lot: a brand new Porsche, a gold Rolex, and, in New York City, one year of kindergarten.\n\nAs the city's affordability crisis deepens, the cost of everything from a slice of pizza to private school has risen to new heights.\n\nAvenues: The World School, a 14-year-old school in Chelsea, is the most expensive, with 2026-2027 tuition set at $75,300 for full-time nursery (age two) through grade 12, up about 4% from the current school year. That's $456 per day.\n\nIt's not alone. Next year, tuition at eight New York City private schools will top $70,000, Bloomberg reported. By comparison, the average tuition of the National Association of Independent Schools' member schools is $33,361 this year. Public school is, of course, free.\n\nFor thousands of parents across the five boroughs, the cost is worth it.\n\nSharon Decker, the cofounder of private school consultancy The Admissions Plan, told Business Insider that she's seen more applications for private schools in the area.\n\n\"It's getting more and more competitive at the upper tiers,\" she said. \"They're maintaining small class sizes; they're hiring expert faculty; they're offering expansive extracurriculars, and the infrastructure is rivaling a small college.\"\n\nFaculty is the main driver of price hikes at Avenues, Tara Powers, the school's head of communications, told Business Insider over email. As the cost of living in New York City continues to grow, the school must adjust, she said, adding that the costs of healthcare and other benefits have also increased.\n\nThough private school teachers don't get paid significantly more than their public school counterparts, there are more of them per student. Avenues has a student-to-teacher ratio of 5:1; New York City public schools have a ratio was 11.5:1.\n\nIt's the No. 1 area in which private schools stand out, Robin Aranow, the founder of a private and public school consultancy School Search NYC, told Business Insider.\n\nThen there's the auxiliary staff: teams of college counselors, learning specialists, advisors, and deans that form \"layers upon layers of support in the schools,\" Decker said.\n\nAvenues, unlike most other private schools, is a for-profit school; therefore, it doesn't report its finances.\n\nThe financial disclosure form for Collegiate, the city's second-most-expensive school, with tuition rising to $72,070 next year, indicates that faculty is, indeed, the school's largest expense. In 2024, the most recent year for which data is available, Collegiate spent $32 million, or 49% of its revenue — made up of tuition, gifts, and investment income — on compensation, including benefits and payroll tax.\n\nA representative for Collegiate did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAcross NAIS member schools, employee salaries accounted for more than 50% of schools' operating expenses, according to a 2025 report.\n\nBooks and other classroom supplies, lunch and snacks, musical instruments, and technology like iPads and MacBooks also factor into tuition. Plus the athletic uniforms, field trips, and costs associated with extracurriculars. There are no Amazon wishlists or classroom fundraisers, which have become popular at public schools.\n\n\"There are incredible athletic facilities with squash courts and Olympic-sized swimming pools,\" Decker said. \"Then for the theater kids, there are one or two black box theaters, and a main stage theater, and sound booths. For the tech kids, coding rooms and robotics rooms.\"\n\nAt least one school, Marymount, has Bloomberg Terminals available to students as part of its financial literacy and entrepreneurship curriculum.\n\n\"The private schools, I think, do a better job of creating what I might call a Renaissance kid,\" Aranow said.\n\nPart of the tuition helps float financial aid offerings. More than 20% of Avenues' students received financial aid this year, Powers said, with the school offering an average award of $49,000. Nearly 10% of Collegiate's 2024 revenue, or $6.2 million, went to grants and other assistance.\n\nStill, few parents who can afford private school are breaking down the five-figure bill to determine whether the line items add up to a good choice for their kid. There are many less tangible reasons they pony up: \"things like status, what other families are doing, what you did,\" Aronow said.\n\nPlus, one of the most valuable parts of a private school education, in the mind of some parents, is a big unknown that may not be resolved for 15 years, when their kids are applying to college.\n\n\"There are definitely families I work with who, when their kids are applying for kindergarten, are thinking about it already,\" Aranow said. \"Will my kid have a chance to go to an Ivy League school? That's what they all want to know.\"",

    "fullText": "Ryan Garcia secured his first major title with a dominant unanimous decision victory over Mario Barrios to become the new WBC welterweight champion.\n\nThe 27-year-old American knocked down compatriot Barrios with a right hand during the first 30 seconds of the opening round in Las Vegas on Saturday.\n\nGarcia, a former interim lightweight champion, was in control for the full 12 rounds and won with scores of 119-108, 120-107 and 118-109.\n\nIn his post-fight interview, Garcia called out newly crowned WBO super-lightweight champion Shakur Stevenson, who was in attendance at T-Mobile Arena.\n\n\"You know who I want, he's right there,\" said Garcia. \"Shakur Stevenson, let's go!\"\n\nFellow American Stevenson, 28, smiled, nodded his head and clapped as Garcia added: \"I want to be a great champion, I'm not scared.\n\n\"I fought Devin Haney. I'll fight you, Shakur Stevenson. I'll fight anybody.\"\n\nGarcia was then told Stevenson had said he was \"levels above\" him right now, to which he replied: \"You've got to have some type of punching power to get me off you, because it'll just be a different style - and I'm not going to hit him light.\"\n\nGarcia was given a one-year ban for failing a drugs test in 2024 after beating Haney, with the victory overturned and the fight recorded as a 'no contest'.\n\nThe win for Garcia was his first since a shock points loss to Rolando Romero last year and improves his record to 25 victories and two defeats.\n\nBarrios was upgraded from interim to full WBC champion in June 2024 and had made two previous successful defences via draws, retaining his title with a majority draw against a then 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last summer.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "It has been a while since Welsh rugby fans have woken up on a Sunday morning after a rugby international feeling agony and hope in equal measure.\n\nBut that is what happened this weekend after Wales' excruciating 26-23 Six Nations defeat against Scotland in Cardiff.\n\nThe agony represents Wales losing - after leading 20-5 and 23-12 - to a Scotland side that only held the advantage for the final six minutes of the game.\n\nThe hope comes from Wales producing the finest performance of the Steve Tandy era, one that shows what could be possible.\n\nYes, it was a 24th defeat in 26 internationals since October 2023 and a 14th successive Six Nations loss in a record stretching back three years.\n\nYes, Wales have slipped to 12th in the world rankings and are still facing another Wooden Spoon with matches to follow against a rejuvenated Ireland and then Italy.\n\nAnd the off-the-field disarray that has engulfed Welsh rugby still exists and will continue to rumble on in the coming weeks.\n\nHowever, for a couple of hours on Saturday evening in the Principality Stadium, in a magically mad occasion against the Scots, the Wales team and fans recreated the epic experience that has been on show so often in the past.\n\nAnd offered hope of what it could look like again in the future.\n\nWales' late loss 'gut-wrenching' - Lake\n\nScotland show 'bottle' & 'grit' in 'ugly' Cardiff win\n\n'Scotland's terrible beauty reverses the narrative on extraordinary day'\n\nFor the opening hour, Wales finally had some attacking momentum with ball-carriers powering over the gain line.\n\nFront-row duo Rhys Carre and captain Dewi Lake had arguably their most effective games for Wales, while Scarlets centre Eddie James provided the midfield momentum with a series of thundering charges in what could prove a coming-of-age performance.\n\nThen there was Aaron Wainwright. The Dragons talisman was immense for a second successive week, continuing his terrific tournament, despite Wales' adversity.\n\nThe back rower has played two games at number eight and featured at blind-side flanker against France.\n\nNo matter where he has been asked to play, Wainwright has consistently been Wales' most effective performer and was the highest carrier with 22 against Scotland, five more than Lake.\n\nThe attacking intent was orchestrated expertly by returning fly-half Sam Costelow, who excelled after replacing Dan Edwards.\n\nCostelow being helped off the field injured in the second half was one of the saddest sights of the day.\n\nWales' defence was still not perfect and they will need a separate specialist coach after the tournament so Tandy is not having to undertake two roles.\n\nBut it was a significant improvement on the 15 tries and 102 points conceded in the opening two heavy defeats against England and France.\n\nIn Tandy's first six games in charge Wales yielded 302 points and 42 tries.\n\nAdd 26 points and four more tries against Scotland - but it was a commendable effort against the wave of Scottish second-half attacks.\n\nIndustrious locks Dafydd Jenkins and Ben Carter, in his first Six Nations start after replacing Adam Beard, topped the tackle charts with 22 each.\n\nForaging flankers Alex Mann and James Botham managed to gain some turnover penalties, which had been sorely lacking in the first two matches.\n\nWing Josh Adams was outstanding in the opening exchanges with a telling try-saving tackle on Huw Jones and vital interception.\n\nAdams' continued selection has received criticism but in an inexperienced backline, what was evident was the amount of organising and communication he was providing, especially in defence.\n\nEnglish referee Matt Carley was officiating in his 50th international and his name popped up quite prominently on social media after the game by Welsh fans who felt hard done by.\n\nThey pointed to a number of decisions which they felt could have gone Wales' way.\n\nThis included Scotland number eight Matt Fagerson being offside and obstructing Wales replacement prop Archie Griffin in the build-up to George Turner's match-winning try from a driving maul.\n\nSome Welsh fans, and former Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies, also felt there was a harsh penalty reversal for a Tomos Williams' illegal clearout at a ruck, when Wales could have kicked three points to extend the lead to seven.\n\nTandy afterwards said he thought that decision was a fair call and refused to blame any decisions for Wales' defeat.\n\nAfter all, Scotland won the second half 21-6 and were the dominant attacking force after half-time.\n\nThe major issue Wales will look at will be concentration for the Darcy Graham try.\n\nIt was inspired by a moment of magic from Finn Russell who capitalised on Wales sleeping in defence from a restart.\n\nThe blame cannot lie with the ball boy or girl who efficiently presented the ball on the halfway line for Russell to kick off quickly.\n\nThey were merely doing their job, while Wales' players were not.\n\nWhether the blame lies with Botham, who watched a ball bounce over his left shoulder, or new cap Gabriel Hamer-Webb who was outpaced by Darcy, will be decided in the post-match review.\n\nWhoever shoulders the responsibility, it proved a major turning point in the game as it reduced the deficit to four points and enabled the visitors to dominate the final quarter.\n\nTandy will also be looking for more impact from his bench after the second-half replacements, prop Nicky Smith aside, failed to match the intensity of the starting side.\n\nThis is compared to Scotland, whose introduced players contributed significantly to the victory.\n\nWales' discipline is still an issue with centre Joe Hawkins picking up a yellow card for an early high tackle, an 11th sin-binning in seven games during Tandy's tenure.\n\nHowever, that is progress from the 16 penalties and four yellow cards conceded just three weeks ago against England.\n\nWales also need to utilise to fins an effective way of maximising Louis Rees Zammit's attacking ability after his switch from wing to full-back.\n\nThe Principality Stadium crowd of 57,744 against France, the lowest in Cardiff in the Six Nations era was criticised. Rightly so.\n\nSix days later, the Cardiff cauldron was completely different as 70,000 witnessed a scintillating spectacle on and off the field.\n\nSome of that was down to Wales' marked improvement, with the home fans starved of any success or expectation during the past couple of years.\n\nAfter all, Wales have now suffered 11 successive Six Nations defeats in Cardiff with the most recent success against Scotland four years ago in February 2022.\n\nBut Wales, led by the inspirational Lake, got the Principality Stadium rocking.\n\n\"The support was incredible,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"There's lots of questions asked about the crowds, but they were unbelievable.\n\n\"Everyone felt it. The players gave them something to cheer about, but ultimately they got behind the team. It's a snapshot of what we want to be.\"\n\nThe challenge, for everybody involved in Welsh rugby, will be to replicate this environment in the final game of the tournament against Italy on 14 March.\n\nThe match has the same early evening kick-off as the Scotland showdown.\n\nThis past weekend cannot be a one-off if Wales are to be inspired to that overdue and elusive Six Nations success in front of their own fans.",

    "fullText": "Linux 7.0 Makes Preparations For Rust 1.95\n\nLast week was the main feature pull of Rust programming language updates for the Linux 7.0 kernel merge window. Most notable with that pull was Rust officially concluding its \"experimental\" in now treating Rust for Linux kernel/driver programming as stable and here to stay. Sent out today was a round of Rust fixes for Linux 7.0 that includes preparations for the upcoming Rust 1.95 release.\r\nRust 1.95 is being branched from master on 27 February and aiming for its stable release on 16 April. Rust 1.95 stabilizes if let guards, changing some ports to tier 2 status, and various other changes.\r\nFor Linux 7.0 they are now passing the \"-Zunstable-options\" flag that will be required by the Rust 1.95 release. The -Zunstable-options allows for the use of other new, unstable command line options.\r\nFor the kernel's irq module, there is a missing bound detected by the in-development Rust 1.95 code to be addressed. With the pin-init crate was also a Clippy warning that changed behavior with the upcoming Rust 1.95 release.\r\nMeanwhile this round of Rust fixes for Linux 7.0 also fixes an objtool warning when using the older Rust 1.84 release plus a fix to the list module to address missing \"unsafe\" blocks and placeholder safety comments to macros.\r\nMore details on these Rust fixes sent out today for Linux 7.0 to focus on future Rust 1.95 compatibility can be found via this pull request.\n\n 14 Comments",

    "title": "California tried to protect students' data. Tech companies found loopholes",
    "description": "A legislative battle is under way over gaps that allow companies to collect and sell students’ personal information.",
    "fullText": "The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, uses investigative reporting, data analysis, and software engineering to challenge technology to serve the public good. \n\nFor every aspect of a student’s life, there’s a tech company trying to digitize it. Inside the classroom, online tools proctor exams, create flashcards and submit assignments. Outside, technology coordinates school sports, helps bus drivers find the right route and maintains students’ health records.\n\nCalifornia has a number of laws aimed at protecting children’s data privacy, but those laws have exceptions that allow many tech companies to continue packaging and selling students’ personal information.\n\nThis year, Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a San Luis Obispo Democrat, is carrying a high-profile state bill that would add new protections for students. She says it’s important, especially as the Trump admin is trying to collect data about California residents’ immigration status, gender identity, and their use of certain public benefits.\n\nHistorically, California has been a leader in data privacy. In 2014, California passed a landmark student privacy law that prohibited technology companies from selling students’ data, targeting students in advertising, or disclosing their personal information. Then in 2018, the state passed another unprecedented bill that required all companies give California users certain privacy rights, such as a chance to opt out of data collection and delete some of their information.\n\nBut as technology evolved and proliferated, privacy laws repeatedly fell short in protecting California’s students — at the same time that the federal government has tried to collect increasing amounts of personal information, Addis said.\n\nHer bill would restrict how AI companies use student data and create new data protections for college students. Some of Sacramento’s most powerful players are paying close attention to the measure, including the California Labor Federation, which supports the bill, and the California Chamber of Commerce, which opposes it. Combined, these two groups spent nearly $8 million on campaign donations to state legislators or other political activities in 2024, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database. TechNet, a trade association that represents many of the most powerful tech companies, also opposes the bill.\n\nThe proposal, Assembly Bill 1159, would close certain loopholes in the state’s 2014 education privacy law, but experts say it may not be enough to prevent companies from selling students’ data.\n\nJen King is a privacy and data policy fellow at Stanford’s institute for AI, where she studies the tricks that companies use to gather users’ data and prevent them from opting out, sometimes known as “dark patterns.” In her personal life, she’s vigilant about avoiding online data tracking and maintains a landline in her Bay Area home to avoid giving out her cell phone number.\n\nKing doesn’t want her children’s information available online or for any company to sell, though sometimes it happens before she can stop it.\n\nIn the fall, King got an email about a platform called TeamSnap, which her 12-year-old son’s cross country coaches were using to manage the team’s roster. The company wanted her information, including her name, date of birth, gender, email address, and phone number. Once she logged in to the platform, she could see some of her son’s information, such as his name, email, and date of birth, were already listed. Photos and personal information from all of her son’s teammates were also available for her to see.\n\n“I was super irritated,” she said. “You don’t need my birth date — I’m a freaking parent.” She acknowledged some personal information could be useful for a coach but said that other questions seem designed to help the platform sell information to data brokers and ultimately, to advertisers.\n\nHer 17-year-old son’s data is also on TeamSnap, she later learned, because his robotics team uses it. This month, when King tried to show The Markup and CalMatters her TeamSnap account, a pop-up appeared, asking her if the company could track her activity across other apps and websites.\n\nFederal law requires companies to get parental consent before knowingly collecting or selling data from children 12 and under, but once a child turns 13, their data is generally treated much like an adult’s information, especially when that child is interacting with tech platforms outside of school. TeamSnap’s privacy policy says it doesn’t knowingly collect personal information about users under 13 “without express parental consent,” though it says in some cases a team or organization may provide information on behalf of the child.\n\nThe policy also says that TeamSnap has “not sold the personal information of any consumer for monetary consideration” in the last 12 months, but that its “use of cookies and other tracking technologies may be considered a sale of personal information under the CCPA (California privacy law).” Information sold to advertisers and marketers included users’ names, contact information, purchase history and geolocation, the policy says.\n\nCalifornia privacy law specifically requires certain large for-profit companies to get consent to collect data from anyone under 16. Often, consent happens when a user first opens a website and a pop-up appears, asking if the website can sell your data or track your cookies.\n\nIf a teacher, coach, or other authority figure tells a student that they have to use a website or an app, then the student cannot realistically opt out, King said. They may be too young to understand how to opt out, she added. “Most 15-, 16-year-olds don’t have any idea what this is about.”\n\nEven older college students may have little agency in the technology they use, especially if it’s required for class or residential life. At Stanford, for example, King said her undergraduate students are often required to create Facebook accounts for student groups.\n\nThe same is true for parents. King said she reluctantly gave TeamSnap her personal information, including her name, email, date of birth, and the landline number for her home, because it was the only way to get updates about her son’s team.\n\nIn 2014, California became the first state in the country to regulate education technology companies directly, but being first comes with its drawbacks. “We didn’t have examples of what best practice was,” said Amelia Vance, the president of the Public Interest Privacy Center, a nonprofit organization. The law only applies to products that “primarily” serve K-12 schools and that are designed and marketed for students.\n\nMany tech companies argue that their products aren’t primarily intended for students or at least that they were not designed or marketed that way. The language-learning app DuoLingo, for example, has a version for schools, but the app is also popular for adults. Apps or technologies serving extracurricular programs or sports teams can claim they weren’t designed and marketed for the classroom, or that their use isn’t mandatory, said Vance. “You have this sort of black hole where there haven’t been protections.”\n\nAddis’ bill expands the number of education technology companies that fall under the state’s student privacy laws, but the language is murky when it comes to apps or online services used outside of class.\n\nIn the case of TeamSnap, Addis’ communications director Alexis Garcia-Arrazola said the company would “most likely” fall under the scope of the bill if its technology is marketed to schools, if schools direct students to use it, and if the sports team is sponsored by the school.\n\nPublic records show that Piedmont Unified School District in Alameda County, Tamalpais Union High School District in Marin County, and Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District all purchased versions of TeamSnap, but only the Santa Monica Malibu district responded to questions about any privacy restriction imposed on the company. Brandyi Phillips, the chief communications officer for the Santa Monica Malibu schools, said the district has an annual subscription with TeamSnap, which is only available to sports staff and parents. She said there’s an agreement with the company “to protect District information and to prevent unauthorized access” but did not clarify if that agreement prevents the district from selling students’ information.\n\nBerkeley Unified School District, where King’s children attend school, did not respond to questions about any contracts, purchase orders or agreements with TeamSnap.\n\nLocally, school districts and colleges have the power to negotiate the privacy terms of any contract they make with a technology company, but many websites and apps offer free versions that a teacher or coach might recommend without getting formal approval from their district.\n\nLast year, the California State University system signed a nearly $17 million contract with Open AI, the company that operates ChatGPT, including an agreement that the company will not train its models on student data. Advocates for Addis’ bill say the same privacy restrictions should apply to any AI company with access to California student data, regardless of whether the company has an agreement with the student’s school district or college.\n\nAddis’ bill comes as privacy laws in California and across the country are in flux. In 2020, California voters approved a proposition to create a new state agency to enforce data privacy rules and regulate the businesses that collect data. Advocates for the proposition contributed over $6.7 million to the campaign, compared to just over $50,000 contributed by the opposition, according to state data. The state agency that the proposition formed, now known as CalPrivacy, released new rules this year, restricting the use of automated decision-making technology, such as the use of AI to make admissions or hiring decisions. Those rules were originally stricter but businesses, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom pressured the CalPrivacy board to water them down.\n\nIn Washington D.C., Congress is considering changing federal law to limit how companies interact with children under 17. Separately, Congress is considering a bill that would require social media companies to prevent and mitigate children’s sexual exploitation, bullying, and self-harm. California Attorney General Rob Bonta is concerned that one version of the social media bill contains language that could erode existing protections in California law.\n\nBonta’s office is responsible for enforcing many of the state’s existing privacy laws. In November, he said the state worked with Connecticut and New York to reach $5.1 million in settlements against Illuminate, an education technology company that uses data to track and evaluate students’ progress, such as their testing scores and developmental milestones. The company had a data breach, exposing “sensitive information” from over 434,000 California students, the state attorney general’s office said in a statement.\n\nIt was the first time California successfully went after a company for violating the state’s landmark 2014 education privacy law.\n\nTo increase enforcement, Addis’ bill contains a new provision — the right for students and parents to sue tech companies in certain cases for privacy violations. Business and technology groups have opposed the bill, arguing that the new regulations and the right to sue would stifle investment in AI-powered learning tools.\n\nKing said that giving consumers the right to sue is often the only way to increase enforcement. Otherwise, the onus is on individual consumers to find concerning practices and try to opt out.\n\nDespite being an expert in data privacy, King said that she struggled at first to figure out how to delete her TeamSnap account, only later to discover that she needed to send an email to the company. She laughed at the irony, since it’s these kinds of dark patterns in user design that fuel part of her research.\n\nIn academia, the strategy of trapping customers is sometimes called the “roach motel,” she explained, a reference to a popular television ad from the late 1970s for a cockroach trap.\n\n“You can check in,” she said, “but you can never check out.”",

    "fullText": "The posts raised alarms, but OpenAI declined to alert law enforcement.\n\nThe posts raised alarms, but OpenAI declined to alert law enforcement.\n\nThe suspect in the mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, Jesse Van Rootselaar, was raising alarms among employees at OpenAI months before the shooting took place. This past June, Jesse had conversations with ChatGPT involving descriptions of gun violence that triggered the chatbot’s automated review system. Several employees raised concerns that her posts could be a precursor to real-world violence and encouraged company leaders to contact the authorities, but they ultimately declined.\n\nOpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood told The Verge that, while the company considered referring the account to law enforcement, it was ultimately decided that it did not constitute an “imminent and credible risk” of harm to others. Wood said that a review of the logs did not indicate there was active or imminent planning of violence. The company banned Rootselaar’s account, but it does not appear to have taken any further precautionary action.\n\nWood said, “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy. We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”\n\nOn February 10th, nine people were killed and 27 injured, including Rootselaar, in the deadliest mass shooting in Canada since 2020. Rootselaar was found dead at the scene of the Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, where most of the killings took place.\n\nThe decision not to alert law enforcement might look misguided in retrospect, but Wood said that OpenAI’s goal is to balance privacy with safety and avoid introducing unintended harm through overly broad use of law enforcement referrals.\n\nUpdated February 21st: Added statement from OpenAI.",

Asha Sharma, currently president of CoreAI product, is taking over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella announced Phil Spencer’s retirement in a memo to all Microsoft employees today. “Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning,” says Nadella. “I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it.”\n\nAsha Sharma is taking over from Phil Spencer as the new Microsoft Gaming CEO. Sharma is currently the president of CoreAI product at Microsoft, and has been working closely on Microsoft’s AI platform efforts since she rejoined Microsoft in 2024. Spencer will remain in an advisory role through the summer to support the transition.\n\nWhile Sharma isn’t a gamer like Spencer, she does have some consumer experience that could certainly help with leading a division as big as Microsoft Gaming. Sharma left a marketing role at Microsoft in 2013 and has worked at Meta as VP of product and engineering and Instacart as chief operating officer before heading back to Microsoft in 2024.\n\nNadella says he’s “long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition,” and believes Sharma has “deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.”\n\nSharma now has three commitments for the future of gaming at Microsoft: great games, the return of Xbox, and the future of play. “We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,” says Sharma in an internal memo. “We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.”\n\nIn a memo to Xbox employees, Spencer reveals that he made the decision to retire from Microsoft in the fall of 2025, just months after rumors circulated online about Spencer’s potential retirement. Microsoft said in July that Spencer was “not retiring anytime soon.”\n\n”Last fall, I shared with Satya that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life,” says Spencer. “From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.”\n\nAs part of the road ahead for Xbox, president Sarah Bond is also leaving Microsoft to “begin a new chapter,” according to Spencer. “Sarah has been instrumental during a defining period for Xbox, shaping our platform strategy, expanding Game Pass and cloud gaming, supporting new hardware launches, and guiding some of the most significant moments in our history,” says Spencer.\n\nMicrosoft is also promoting Matt Booty to EVP and chief content officer, after previously promoting him to an expanded president of game content and studios position in 2023. “I read Phil’s note with much gratitude,” says Booty in an internal memo to Microsoft’s gaming employees. “He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support.”\n\nYou can read Phil Spencer’s full retirement memo here.\n\nSpencer has been at Microsoft since he first joined as an intern in 1988. In his early career at Microsoft he worked on Encarta, Microsoft Money, and Microsoft Works. Spencer joined the Xbox division in 2001, and became the general manager of Microsoft Studios in 2008. He then became the leader of the Xbox division in 2014, overseeing the launch of the Xbox Series X / S and Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass push.\n\nSpencer has also been at the center of Microsoft’s major gaming acquisitions, including Minecraft maker Mojang, Activision Blizzard, and ZeniMax Media.\n\n“When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve, or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join,” says Spencer. “It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.”",

    "fullText": "The Olympics. There's nothing quite like it.\n\nThe world's greatest sporting showcase - and a hub of weird and wonderful stories.\n\nThink the Australian breakdancer, the 'Muffin Man' and the random guy in his swimming trunks at Paris 2024. The robots at Beijing 2022. The green diving pool at Rio 2016.\n\nThe Games always throws up the unexpected - and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics has been no different.\n\nHere are just some of the stories we didn't think we would be telling from over the past few weeks.\n\nThe Olympics had not even got under way when the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) responded to claims that male ski jumpers were injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance.\n\nGerman newspaper Bild reported that jumpers were injecting their genitals with hyaluronic acid - which is not banned in sport - to increase their size before being measured for their suits.\n\nThe bigger the surface area of the suits, the more flight in the air.\n\nAsked about the claims, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: \"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related.\"\n\nInternational Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: \"There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.\"\n\nThat wasn't the end of the headlines for ski jumping either. Later in the Games, Austria's Daniel Tschofenig was disqualified from the men's large hill individual event for wearing oversized boots - that were just four millimetres larger than the rules permitted.\n\nHow penis injections became a Winter Olympic talking point\n\n'Extremely stupid' - ski jumper disqualified over boots\n\nNorway's Sturla Holm Laegreid won bronze in the 20km individual biathlon - and then confessed live on TV to cheating on his girlfriend.\n\nHe admitted he had an affair three months ago and called it \"my biggest mistake\", adding it had been \"the worst week of my life\" since he told his girlfriend of six months about the affair.\n\n\"I had the gold medal in life,\" he said.\n\nThe following day, his ex-girlfriend, writing anonymously in Norwegian newspaper VG, said she \"did not choose to be put in this position\".\n\nShe wrote: \"It's hard to forgive. Even after a declaration of love in front of the whole world.\n\n\"We have been in contact and he is aware of my feelings about this.\"\n\nLaegreid wins bronze then confesses to affair on TV\n\nIt happened at Paris 2024 and it's happened again at Milan-Cortina 2026. Breaking medals.\n\nEarly in the Games, two of the USA's gold medallists, Breezy Johnson and Alysa Liu, revealed the ribbon had come away from their medals soon after they received their prize.\n\nJohnson's broke while she was being interviewed by BBC Sport and speaking at a news conference afterwards, she said: \"So there's the medal. And there's the ribbon.\n\n\"And here's the little piece that is supposed to go into the ribbon to hold the medal, and yeah, it came apart.\"\n\nAndrea Francisi, Milan-Cortina 2026 chief Games operations officer, said: \"We are going to pay maximum attention to the medals. Obviously this is something we want to be perfect when the medal is handed over because this is one of the most important moments for the athletes.\"\n\nOlympic bosses investigate why medals are breaking\n\nAccusations of cheating. Swear words being hurled across the ice. Counter-claims of a sting operation with illicit filming. In curling?!\n\nThe drama started when Canada's Marc Kennedy became involved in a heated verbal exchange with Sweden's Oskar Eriksson towards the end of his side's 8-6 win.\n\nThe Swedes believed Kennedy was repeatedly double-touching some of his stones, an illegal move.\n\nBut the cards were signed by both teams at the end, meaning the result would stand in a sport that is proudly self-governed by the players.\n\nAnd then video footage found its way into circulation post-match. Was it premeditated?\n\nThe following day, Switzerland reported Kennedy for the same offence. World Curling then announced they would deploy extra officials for the remainder of the Games to check for double-touching.\n\nCanadian women's skip Rachel Holman was pinged for a double-touch, as was Team GB's Bobby Lammie - both incidents not deliberate and the case of a lingering figure falling on to the granite.\n\nWorld Curling changed its protocol again and teams could now request to have the stone delivery monitored if they had suspicions, and for a minimum of three ends.\n\nSwearing, illicit filming & rule changes - what next in curling cheating row?\n\nWe thought Snoop would be the only Dogg we saw at the Winter Olympics.\n\nAnd then an actual one chased cross-country skiers down the finishing straight in the women's team sprint event.\n\nThe Czechoslovakian Wolfdog had broken free of its owner and made its way on to the course in Tesero, where it then chased a camera over the line.\n\nGreek athlete Konstantina Charalampidou said: \"I became famous with a dog that came across the finish line and everyone wants to interview me now.\n\n\"I wanted to pet him but I didn't have the time and I couldn't find him afterwards.\"\n\nThroughout the season, Spanish figure skater Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate has skated to a mix of music from the Minions animated film series, all while clad in a yellow T-shirt and blue dungarees like the film's characters.\n\nYet at the Olympics, it seemed that he would have to change his usual routine in the men's singles because of a copyright issue.\n\nBut after negotiations with representatives of Pharrell Williams, singer of Happy - a song that appears in Despicable Me 2 and one of Sabate's selections - an agreement was reached and he was granted permission.\n\nIt didn't bring Sabate any luck, however, as he placed 25th.\n\nOlympic skater given Minions music permission\n\nAt the curling we had the moonwalking technician 'pebbling' the ice while at the figure skating, we saw the incredible skill of the on-ice camera operator.\n\nUp in Livigno, hats off to the 'chief of colour' line painters, spraying blue lines on to the snow with incredibly precise skill on skis, plus a nod to the course slippers, who took their moments in the spotlight by performing the Mobot (a Mo Farah pose) and Usain Bolt's lightning pose as they cleared the halfpipe of loose snow.\n\nAccording to organisers, there is a workforce of approximately 25,000 people at these Games, with 18,000 of them being volunteers.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Freestyle skier Zoe Atkin won bronze in the women's halfpipe to secure Great Britain's fifth medal at the 2026 Winter Olympics, equalling the team's record-best haul.\n\nThe 23-year-old had already secured a medal when she dropped into the pipe for her final run and, with the pressure off, improved her score to 92.50 - just half a point shy of silver medal position.\n\nChina's global superstar Eileen Gu won gold, her first of these Games after two silvers, with 94.75, while compatriot Li Fanghui took silver.\n\nIn winning bronze, Atkin matches the achievement of her sister Izzy, who won Team GB's first Olympic medal on skis with slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang eight years ago.\n\n\"I am so happy. I've been looking forward to this for at least the past four years and it was so overwhelming with the crowd and knowing it was the Olympics - so many emotions,\" she told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I was so stressed out and I was crying and to put two runs down felt so good and the cherry on top is getting on the Olympic podium.\n\n\"It means so much to me and I've literally dreamed about this moment since watching my sister win her bronze in 2018, so to back her up eight years later feels so good and to have her supporting me here it feels full circle. I am so stoked.\"\n\nWith five medals secured - three golds, one silver and now a bronze - Team GB have matched the record hauls they achieved in Sochi in 2014 and the 2018 Games in South Korea.\n\nBut this was the team's most successful Winter Olympics the moment Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale secured the second of those golds in the mixed team snowboard cross exactly a week ago.\n\nNever before had Great Britain won more than one gold at a single Winter Games.\n\nAtkin came into her second Olympics fresh from winning X Games gold and as the reigning world champion, eager to improve on the ninth-place finish she achieved on her debut in Beijing four years ago.\n\nShe had qualified top of the standings for the final, which was postponed to Sunday morning after heavy snowfall in Livigno the previous day.\n\nThere she remained after the first run, with a score of 90.50, after Gu - the defending champion - had fallen on her opening trick.\n\nOn the second run, the roles reversed. Gu vastly improved with a 94.00, as did Li with 91.50, only for Atkin to fall on her effort.\n\nGu, the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history, boosted her score further on her third and final run, leaving Atkin knowing she would have to be perfect to challenge for gold.\n\nBut with the medal already in the bag, Atkin was smiling at the top of the pipe as she dropped in for one last time, enjoying a pressure-free run and seemingly unbothered that the two points she gained were not enough for a higher step on the podium.\n\nThe top of the icy Winter Olympics halfpipe is a world away from the Californian climes of Stanford University.\n\nAnd yet it is where Atkin's two worlds collide.\n\nAs an Olympic medal-winning skier - and a student at one of the United States' most prestigious colleges.\n\nAtkin, who was born and raised in the US to a Malaysian mother and English father, studies symbolic systems - \"a mix of cognitive science, studying the brain, how it works and the mechanisms of that, combined with computer science and studying those machines,\" as she told BBC Sport before the Games.\n\nOlympic halfpipes are 6.7m high, with Atkin achieving an amplitude of more than 5m during her final.\n\nThat means, should something go wrong mid-air, athletes have a near 12m drop on to pure ice, a risk Atkin had previously struggled to cope with.\n\n\"I have learned so much that has helped me so much being an athlete in an action sport. The tricks and manoeuvres that we're doing inherently have a lot of risk to them,\" she said.\n\n\"I've struggled with fear a lot in the past, especially when I was younger. Learning about the mechanisms of the brain has really helped me apply those learnings and new mindsets and be able to test those theories, in practice, in my sport.\n\n\"It's in those really hard moments that you show yourself what is possible and that is when you really push your limits.\n\n\"I've been able to find my power in that.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

The other half is scattered across 16 verticals, none above 9%. Healthcare is 1%. Legal is 0.9%. Education is 1.8%. These aren’t saturated markets. They’re markets that barely exist.\n\nAnthropic just published the most comprehensive study of how AI agents actually work in the wild. The headline: software engineering accounts for 49.7% of agentic tool calls on their API. The buried lede: everything else is greenfield.\n\nHere’s what should make founders salivate: the models are already more capable than users trust them to be.\n\nMETR’s capability assessments show Claude can solve tasks that would take a human nearly five hours. But in practice, the 99.9th percentile session runs only about 42 minutes. That gap, between what AI can do and what we let it do, is a massive opportunity.\n\nBetween October 2025 and January 2026, the 99.9th percentile turn duration nearly doubled, from under 25 minutes to over 45 minutes. The growth is smooth across model releases. This isn’t just better models. It’s users extending trust, session by session, as they learn to work alongside agents.\n\nThe capability is there. The deployment isn’t. That’s not a problem. That’s a product opportunity.\n\nNew users approve 20% of Claude Code sessions automatically. By 750 sessions, over 40% run on full auto-approve. But here’s the counterintuitive finding: experienced users also interrupt MORE, not less. New users interrupt 5% of turns. Veterans interrupt 9%.\n\nThis isn’t a contradiction. It’s a shift in oversight strategy. Beginners approve each step before it happens. Veterans delegate and intervene when something goes wrong. They’ve moved from pre-approval to active monitoring.\n\nAnd here’s the safety finding that matters: on complex tasks, Claude Code asks for clarification more than twice as often as humans interrupt it. The agent is pausing to check, not barreling ahead. That’s a feature, not a bug.\n\nAaron Levie points to the untold wealth and value ready to be unlocked. Build agentic software that taps into proprietary data. Make the software actually work for real people and problems. Stuff that context to maximize intelligence coming out. And, the part most founders miss: drive change management for customers.\n\nThat last piece is why vertical AI is so defensible. Anyone can build a wrapper. Few can navigate the specific workflows, regulatory constraints, and organizational friction of healthcare billing or legal discovery or construction permitting.\n\nSaaS has grown 10x per decade for a few decades now. Over 40% of VC dollars in the past 20 years went to SaaS companies. The industry produced 170+ SaaS unicorns. The thesis is simple: every one of those unicorns has a vertical AI equivalent waiting. And the AI versions could be 10x larger, because they don’t just replace software, they replace the operators too.\n\nAnthropic’s core finding deserves attention from anyone writing AI policy. Autonomy isn’t a property of the model. It’s co-constructed by the model, the user, and the product. Pre-deployment evaluations can’t capture this. You have to measure in the wild.\n\nArchived tweet\n\n Software engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries. \n\nAs the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research. https://t.co/p8pOjgJPrh\n\n Anthropic\n @AnthropicAI\n\n February 18, 2026\n\nSoftware engineering makes up ~50% of agentic tool calls on our API, but we see emerging use in other industries. \n\nAs the frontier of risk and autonomy expands, post-deployment monitoring becomes essential. We encourage other model developers to extend this research. https://t.co/p8pOjgJPrh\n\nThe numbers are reassuring on safety: 73% of tool calls have a human in the loop. Only 0.8% of actions are irreversible. The riskiest deployments, things like API key exfiltration or autonomous crypto trading, are mostly security evaluations, not live production.\n\nPolicy that mandates “approve every action” will kill the productivity gains without adding safety. The better target is ensuring humans can monitor and intervene, not mandating specific approval workflows.\n\nThe map is drawn. Software engineering is spoken for. Healthcare, legal, finance, education, customer service, logistics, 16 verticals with single-digit market share each, are waiting for someone to build the domain expertise into the agent.\n\n300 SaaS unicorns came before. 300 vertical AI unicorns are coming next. The founders who pick a vertical, build domain expertise into their agents, and figure out change management will own the next decade of enterprise software.\n\nThe models can already work for five hours. Users only let them work for 42 minutes. That’s an indicator: we are so early, and there is a lot more to build, and in so many places that haven’t even seen a single minute of intelligence in action.\n\nRead Anthropic's full research on AI agent autonomy",

    "fullText": "For nineteen years, until his retirement in 1885, Herman Melville would awake, slick back his dark hair and unsnarl the snags from his beard, don a uniform of dark navy pilot cloth and affix to his chest the brass badge of a U.S. Customs Inspector. Operating at the Lower Manhattan docks, Melville’s task was to examine ship manifests against unloaded cargo. “I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote,” said Ishmael in Moby-Dick. “I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.”\n\nBefore penning those watery books Typee, Benito Cereno, The Confidence Man, and Billy Budd (and of course the one about the whale), Melville had been a sailor on the St. Lawrence in 1839, a harpooner aboard the Acushnet in 1841, even a mutineer briefly on the Lucy Ann a year later. In middle age, though, the only seaway Melville encountered was the brackish Hudson and his journeys consisted of tabulating the wool unloaded from Manchester, rum from Havana, and tea from Calcutta.\n\nMelville came to this profession was after his most famous books had already been published, albeit to scant acclaim, with The Boston Post appraising Moby-Dick as “not worth the money asked.” Devastated by the criticism, he now rather engaged in the methodical examination of ship manifests, saving his leisure time to poetry, which also went unappreciated. Whatever his contemporaries thought of Melville’s prose, at least his coworkers respected his dedication and honesty, the later a rare commodity in government work during the late nineteenth-century. Despite being respected by his colleagues, the author of Moby-Dick worked for six days a week in the domed and columned Merchant’s Exchange Building at 55 Wall Street and was paid $4 a day, never receiving a raise in two decades.\n\nIf writing is work, there is also the vocation about it, the sense that should never be forgotten that it’s not just labor, but a privilege.\n\nMy own time in the federal government was blessedly briefer—rather than nineteen years I only served six months after my January 2020 Constitutional oath delivered at the United States Postal Service headquarters in L’Enfant Plaza. Though I’m no Melville, a not dissimilar professional dissatisfaction both drove us into the writers’ bane of the necessary day job.\n\nIn my case it wasn’t a withering review from The Boston Post, but rather the ample disrespect, nonexistent benefits, and abysmal pay of university adjuncting, and so I answered a LinkedIn ad for communications at the USPS where I became the editor of the southeastern regional employee newsletter, overseeing a staff of seven while revising stories about counterfeit coupon schemes in Atlanta or dog bite prevention programs in Charlotte. My acceptance precipitated an existential crisis since the job was so distant from what I’d been trained to do. Surely, I’d be the rare specialist in seventeenth-century literature drafting articles about relay box arrow key security or maintenance of the Gruman LLV (i.e. the Long Life Vehicle of the white postal truck, as civilians call it).\n\nWhen I told a grad school friend that I’d be working for the USPS, he said to me “That’s some real Herman Melville shit.” And so, for the twenty-four weeks that I was “#PostalProud,” my official federal password was “CallMeIshmael” with some random numbers stuck on the end. Every morning, I drove to a brutalist mail sorting plant in the DC neighborhood of Brentwood and sit in my sterile cubicle for the next eight hours deleting emails all day.\n\nBecause I’d been spoiled by academe, where maybe one can work sixty hours a week, but at least they are hours of your own choosing, I’d never experienced the fluorescent-lit, dry-aired, sterile, cage of boring office work. The job was easy and boring—forty minutes of weekly work stretched into forty hours. My manager—as so many are—was a jackass, the sort who when we went to a ceremony in downtown Washington blew cigarette smoke onto me while we headed toward the Farragut West Metro station, the White House looming behind us, while complaining about how soft younger people are or who questioned why in a headline that I wrote about post offices in South Carolina collecting stuffed animals in a friendly competition why I would use the word “menagerie,” since it was “obscene” (later I realized he’d confused it with “ménage à trois”).\n\nLike Melville scribbling verse in his notebook, I didn’t let mere employment get in the way of my work. During my time there, I finished two books and tried to keep up with two essays a week, mostly written during my off-hours, though occasionally while at the Processing and Distribution Center, surreptitiously printing things off and then retyping them when home, since I couldn’t email documents to a private account on a federal computer (that and Signal Chat are reserved for members of the current administration).\n\nWhen a group of terminally online tankies harassed me on Twitter because they disagreed with an essay I wrote for Poetry about the English Marxist poet Sean Bonney, I was accused of working for the CIA, to which I took some grim satisfaction, as I did have the lowest level of security clearance, albeit not as a spy but as a glorified mailman with a thesaurus.\n\nDuring the long hours I spent slowly circling the windowless, concrete halls of the building, sometimes sneaking off to a depressing shopping center on Rhode Island Avenue, I’d entertain Walter Mitty fantasies of being a gonzo journalist researching the sublimity of bureaucracy (my own unnecessary job aside, I was—and am—impressed by the actual organizational ballet of the USPS). Much of this was the disjunct between how I’d conceived of myself—as a teacher, a writer—and the work that I was now doing.\n\nNo doubt there may be an ugly elitism in that perspective, but in this particular position—unlike the actual handlers, clerks, and carriers who provide an unimaginably important service which is unironically one of the genuine achievements of American civilization—my work could be categorized as what the anthropologist David Graeber astutely and succinctly described as a “bullshit job.”\n\nLabor is the curse of the writing class. Unless you’re independently wealthy, of course. Most writers have always had to suffer unrelated toil just to be able to pay the bills. There have been some brief historical exceptions to that state of affairs; the ascendancy of higher education in the years after World War II gave writers a home in the academy that was largely nonexistent before. Colleges and universities, contrary to fevered denunciations from reactionaries, are not collectives of sloth, but traditionally the protections of tenure did make them sights of independence free of the Panopticon manager tabulating how many minutes they took for lunch.\n\nConcurrently with the ascendancy of higher education came the triumph of American mid-century publishing when writers could actually make a living from advances and royalties. Those were always exceptions, however, even during the halcyon post-war days, and so most writers have always had other jobs, and ones that are sometimes quite distant from writing.\n\nExcluding the literary adjacent work of editing (like Toni Morrison at Random House) or being a professor (everyone), there have been writers in all kinds of bizarre positions, from William S. Burroughs (despite the trust fund) working as an insect exterminator to Octavia Butler’s job as a potato chip quality control expert. Joseph Heller was a blacksmith, James Joyce worked in a movie theater, and Jack Kerouac was a dishwasher (as was I, for a period—satisfying work). Government positions, especially during the era of political patronage, was a common means of employment.\n\nWalt Whitman was a proud government bean counter during the last days of the Civil War and into the following decade, working variously for the Army Paymaster’s Office and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Nathaniel Hawthorne also held the position of a U.S. Customs Inspector working in Salem, but unlike his friend Melville he actually wrote about the experience, exclaiming in the famous meta-fictional prologue to The Scarlett Letter that “Neither the front nor the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise.” Meanwhile, Hawthorne’s description of his workplace being “cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint” was an apt summation of my experience, though I imagine that the processing plant smelled more like weed than the custom house did.\n\nIn fact lots of writers were postal workers, including Anthony Trollope, William Faulkner, and Charles Bukowski. Faulkner was briefly a postmaster in Mississippi, though he sent the most amazing resignation letter which read that “I will be damned if I propose to be at the beck and call of every itinerant scoundrel who has two cents to invest in a postage stamp.” Bukowski was a carrier in Los Angeles, though unlike Faulkner he never got in trouble for his inveterate drinking on the job. “Any damn fool can beg up some kind of job,” writes Bukowski in Post Office, “it takes a wise man to make it without working.” Maybe—my problem at Brentwood was that there was no real work, making me wonder why I had been paid so poorly for teaching when that was so much harder. I discovered that indolency is the purgatory of the workaholic. Despite that, there were writers who had day jobs that, apparently, they loved.\n\nStrangely some of the most famous examples are of accountants and insurance salesman. T.S. Eliot worked for Lloyd’s Bank and Wallace Stevens was a lawyer for the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, supposedly stomping out the meter of his poems as he composed in his head while walking through the glum Connecticut morning streets. They do feel like the exception though.\n\nThank God we’ve got our poets and novelists working on assembly lines and in fields that can affix those moments in verse like Nabokov pinning a butterfly to a board.\n\nA different insurance agent, Franz Kafka, wrote in his diary that “My job is unbearable to me because it conflicts with my only desire and my only calling, which is literature.” Few have been able to express the soul-crushingness of corporate anonymity quite like Kafka (can you imagine him seeing a cubicle!), but lots of writers drew inspiration from work itself. We are human and should let nothing which is human be foreign to us, even filling out requisitioning forms or performing data entry in a spread sheet.\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams used his physician’s prescription pad to first write some of the most crystalline modernist verse, Frank O’Hara composed his Lunch Poems while working as a security guard at the Museum of Modern Art, Paul Lawrence Dunbar composed in his head while operating a Dayton, Ohio elevator, Agatha Christie developed her deep knowledge of poison while earning her living as a pharmacist, while Harper Lee was an airline ticketing agent plotting out To Kill a Mockingbird in her head. Even Vladimir Nabokov organized the butterfly collection at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, though that’s an example of work that’s even more ethereal than poetry.\n\nWhich raises the question of the relationship between work and writing. Is the later equivalent to the former? At the most obvious level, of course. Writing is tiring, stressful, and often disappointing, like any job. There is, for us lucky few, a remunerative quality to the craft which identifies it as labor, with Stephen King arguing in On Writing that if you “wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn’t bounce and if you then paid the light bill with the money” then you are a genuine writer. Even though how we think about the literary life is gauzy and sentimental, it’s still a job where you put your hours in.\n\nBut, if writing is work, there is also the vocation about it, the sense that should never be forgotten that it’s not just labor, but a privilege. To put some words after the other and then have another human being spend a few minutes with those words, whether in agreement or disagreement, is an incomparable honor. To be able to arrange these blocks of words, engineer those sentences, and build those paragraphs so that an order emerges, no matter how shoddy, is the closest thing to mysticism that I can imagine, so that to merely call it a “job” seems a diminishment (though I appreciate the checks).\n\nWhich is not to say that somebody can’t feel the same about being a janitor, or an insurance salesman, or a potato chip inspector. Yet there are moments when the labor of writing and the vocation of work can coincide. “The people I love the best/jump into the work headfirst,” writes Marge Piercy in a poem from her 1982 collection Circles on the Water. “But the thing worth doing well done/has a shape that satisfies.” There can be an ecstasy in work—not just the taste of bread, but also the odor of roses.\n\nMost people don’t like their jobs, or at least many don’t, which means that any moments of transcendence, ecstasy, or beauty, caught in the midst of a day job are precious, and thank God we’ve got our poets and novelists working on assembly lines and in fields that can affix those moments in verse like Nabokov pinning a butterfly to a board. Robert Pinsky’s tailor’s litany of the “presser, the cutter, /The wringer, the mangle. The needle, the union, /The treadle, the bobbin;” Elizabeth Bishop describing a filling station’s “oil-soaked, oil-permeated…over-all/black transparency;” Susan Meyers’ mother washing dishes at the window, “Not wanting to give up the gloss/of the magnolia, the school traffic humming./Sunset, finches at the feeder. First sightings/of the mail truck at the curb.”\n\nAs for me, I abandoned my own figurative mail truck a half-year after I started. The president of the United States at the time, who is unfortunately again the president of the United States, had appointed a new Postmaster General, and despite the global pandemic that was at that time approaching a million deaths, we were about to be ordered back to the office. Not only that, but a newsletter photo collage that I had to make with various scenes from local postal events had been edited to include said president, the purposefully apolitical department already seeing a bit of the bad old patronage politics of Melville’s day creep back in.\n\nAnd so, at my half-year review, I had the satisfaction so rarely enjoyed of being able to tell my manager that I was done, my only regret being that I couldn’t answer with that beloved refrain from Melville’s titular character in Bartleby, the Scrivener, the disaffected office clerk who answers any requests for work with a simple “I’d prefer not to.”",

    "description": "How Fastcc, a self-hosting ARM64 C compiler, was built from scratch in 10 days with largely autonomous AI-driven development.",
    "fullText": "Recently, we completed Fastcc, a self-hosting C compiler built from scratch. The project was carried out with minimal human involvement and targets the ARM64 architecture.\n\nGithub Repo: https://github.com/moonbit-community/fastcc\n\nWe set a deliberately ambitious goal: to start from zero and build a C compiler, while keeping human involvement as limited as possible.\n\nThe initial motivation was to understand how current AI systems behave when tasked with a large, end-to-end software project.\n\nTraditionally, building a full C compiler is considered a complex engineering task. It involves multiple stages — lexical analysis, parsing, semantic checks, optimization passes, and code generation — and typically requires deep domain knowledge and months (or even years) of focused work.\n\nThe process began with a single voice instruction to the AI agent:\r\n“Build a C compiler from scratch, close to tcc, targeting ARM64.”\n\nWe chose tcc (Tiny C Compiler) as a reference because of its fast compilation speed, which is particularly important for MoonBit’s development workflow. MoonBit’s Native backend supports both LLVM and C, and having a dedicated C compiler enables full self-hosting.\n\nAt the same time, tcc is unsafe, poorly maintained, and leaves room for architectural improvements. To keep the scope focused, we limited the target to ARM64.\n\nHere, “self-hosting” means Fastcc was able to compile the C output generated from its own source and run its test suite:\n\nFastcc could also compile the tcc source code at this stage. For performance testing we used v.c, a single-file snapshot of the V compiler.\n\nIn early benchmarks, Fastcc was about 60× slower than tcc on this input. After subsequent profiling and targeted optimizations, the compilation throughput improved substantially, reaching around 4× faster than clang -O0 on the same benchmark.\n\nThroughout most of the development process, the AI agent decomposed and implemented tasks autonomously. Its work included:\n\nDesigning the abstract syntax tree (AST)\n\nGenerating core compiler modules\n\nImplementing multiple optimization passes\n\nDebugging using lldb as part of its own investigation\n\nProfiling performance hotspots using Xcode command-line tools, based on high-level guidance\n\nWriting scripts to identify hot paths and guide targeted optimizations\n\nAlthough the initial directive referenced tcc’s structure, the agent chose a multi-pass design rather than a single-pass model, prioritizing correctness and extensibility over strict structural similarity.\n\nHuman involvement was limited to occasional guidance and corrective direction, mainly at the level of goals and evaluation rather than step-by-step instruction.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this outcome was not accidental. It was made possible by MoonBit’s toolchain and language design, which together enable sustained, large-scale, agent-driven software development.",

And if just 800 other companies had done the same? “No other person in the United States would have had to pay a dime of federal taxes,” he said. “Whether income taxes, no Social Security taxes, no estate taxes — up and down the line.”\n\nIt was the kind of line that makes an arena full of shareholders applaud — not because it was rehearsed, but because it was true.\n\nBuffett has long been transparent about how he views the relationship between profitable companies and the government. At the meeting, he framed it in characteristically simple terms. “The federal government owns a part of the earnings of the business we make,\" he said. \"They don’t own the assets, but they own a percentage of the earnings. And they can change that percentage any year.”\n\nTrending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\n\nThe current corporate tax rate sits at 21%, established under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But Buffett made clear he doesn’t expect that number to stay put. With the national deficit ballooning and political appetite for spending cuts remaining limited, he suggested that higher rates are “quite likely.” The government, he said, “may decide that someday they don’t want the fiscal deficit to be this large” and “may decide they’ll take a larger percentage of what we earn.”\n\nHis response to that possibility was remarkably unbothered: “We’ll pay it.”\n\nThere was no talk of restructuring, relocating, or lobbying for loopholes. Just a plainspoken acceptance that taxation is part of the deal — and one he considers fair.",

    "description": "That's the third leader from the Kingdom of God Global Church alleged to be part of a sprawling forced labor and money laundering scheme.",
    "fullText": "A federal grand jury in Michigan has indicted a third defendant in an alleged forced labor conspiracy tied to the Kingdom of God Global Church — a sprawling ministry that prosecutors say used coercion, abuse and threats of divine punishment to run a multi-state call center operation that brought in roughly $50 million in donations over more than a decade.\n\nKathleen Klein, 53, known within the church as \"Prophetess,\" was named in a superseding indictment returned Feb. 11 in the Eastern District of Michigan, the U.S. Department of Justice announced (1). She joins co-defendants David Taylor and Michelle Brannon, who were first indicted in July 2025 and arrested the following month in a coordinated nationwide takedown by the FBI.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nRobert Kiyosaki says this 1 asset will surge 400% in a year — and he begs investors not to miss its ‘explosion’\n\nKlein is charged with conspiracy to commit forced labor, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Taylor, the church's founder, and Brannon, its executive director, each face up to 20 years per count on charges of forced labor, conspiracy to commit forced labor and money laundering conspiracy. All three defendants have denied the allegations.\n\n\"This case reflects the gravity of forced labor schemes that strip victims of their basic human rights and subject them to physical and brutal psychological abuse,\" Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva said in a statement. \"Combating human trafficking is a top priority for the Department of Justice. We will relentlessly pursue those who facilitate and profit from forced labor and fight to obtain justice for survivors.\"\n\nThe superseding indictment also added new allegations that Taylor frequently requested and received sexually explicit photographs and videos from female church workers — some of whom prosecutors say were afraid to refuse.\n\nThe church, formerly known as Joshua Media Ministries International, was headquartered in Taylor, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. According to court filings, Taylor referred to himself as an \"Apostle\" and claimed to be Jesus Christ's \"best friend\" and \"second in command\" (2). The Justice Department says the church operated at least nine call centers across Michigan, Missouri, Florida and Texas (3).",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - India moved to deepen trade ties with Brazil on Saturday, signing a pact to expand ‌cooperation in mining and minerals as it seeks to meet rising domestic steel ‌demand and support capacity expansion amid a global race for raw materials.\n\nThe agreement was signed in the presence ​of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who arrived in New Delhi earlier this week for a three-day visit.\n\nBrazil is among the world's top producers of iron ore and holds large reserves of minerals critical to steelmaking. Closer ‌cooperation is expected to improve India's ⁠access to raw materials and technologies needed to sustain long-term growth in its steel sector, an Indian government statement said.\n\nThe cooperation will ⁠focus on attracting investment in exploration, mining and steel sector infrastructure, the statement said.\n\nIndia has steelmaking capacity of 218 million metric tons, and companies are expanding output to meet rising domestic ​demand ​driven by infrastructure development and industrialisation.\n\nAddressing a meeting ​with a Brazilian delegation led by ‌Lula, Modi said their talks had focused on ways to deepen the India-Brazil trade partnership.\n\n\"We are committed to taking bilateral trade much beyond $20 billion in the next five years,\" Modi said.\n\nBilateral trade between the two countries currently stands at about $15 billion.\n\n\"Our nations will also work closely in areas such as technology, innovation, digital public infrastructure, AI, semiconductors and more,\" ‌Modi said.\n\nLARGEST TRADING PARTNER IN LATIN AMERICA\n\nIndia and ​Brazil have been strategic partners since 2006, with cooperation ​spanning trade, defence, energy, agriculture, health, ​critical minerals, technology and digital infrastructure.\n\nBrazil is India's largest trading partner ‌in the Latin America and Caribbean region, ​and the two countries ​work closely on global issues such as U.N. reform, climate change and counter-terrorism.\n\nLula on Thursday advocated for Brazil and India to conduct trade in their own currencies ​rather than settling transactions in ‌U.S. dollars, but dismissed speculation that the BRICS group of countries, of ​which both nations are members, would create a common currency.",

    "fullText": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary will block a planned 90-billion-euro ($106-billion) European Union loan to Ukraine until the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline resumes, Hungary's foreign minister said.\n\nRussian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since Jan. 27 after what Ukrainian officials said was a Russian drone attack damaged the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude across Ukrainian territory and into Central Europe.\n\nHungary and Slovakia, which have both received a temporary exemption from an EU policy prohibiting imports of Russian oil, have accused Ukraine — without providing evidence — of deliberately holding up supplies. Both countries ceased shipping diesel to Ukraine this week over the interruption in oil flows .\n\nIn a video posted on social media Friday evening, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó accused Ukraine of “blackmailing” Hungary by failing to restart shipments. He said his government would block a massive interest-free loan the EU approved in December to help Kyiv to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years.\n\n“We will not give in to this blackmail. We do not support Ukraine’s war, we will not pay for it,” Szijjártó said. “As long as Ukraine blocks the resumption of oil supplies to Hungary, Hungary will block European Union decisions that are important and favorable for Ukraine.”\n\nHungary's decision to block the key funding came two days after it suspended diesel shipments to its embattled neighbor and only days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nNearly every country in Europe has significantly reduced or entirely ceased Russian energy imports since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Yet Hungary and Slovakia — both EU and NATO members — have maintained and even increased supplies of Russian oil and gas.\n\nHungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has long argued Russian fossil fuels are indispensable for its economy and that switching to energy sourced from elsewhere would cause an immediate economic collapse — an argument some experts dispute.\n\nWidely seen as the Kremlin’s biggest advocate in the EU, Orbán has vigorously opposed the bloc’s efforts to sanction Moscow over its invasion, and blasted attempts to hit Russia’s energy revenues that help finance the war. His government has frequently threatened to veto EU efforts to assist Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday, Slovakia's populist Prime minister Robert Fico said his country will stop providing emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine if oil is not flowing through the Druzhba by Monday. Orbán's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, said earlier this week that Hungary, too, was exploring the possibility of cutting off its electricity supplies to Ukraine.\n\nNot all of the EU's 27 countries agreed to take part in the 90-billion-euro loan package for Kyiv. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opposed the plan, but a deal was reached in which they did not block the loan and were promised protection from any financial fallout.",

    "fullText": "FALLBROOK, Calif. (FOX 5/KUSI) — A Fallbrook family got an unexpected and unsettling surprise this week when a mountain lion turned up in a backyard trap set to catch whatever had been killing their animals.\n\nThe discovery came after several animals went missing from the Hernandez family property, including chickens kept in a henhouse and four cats, one of which was pregnant.\n\n“There was a big hole on the rooftop and there were chickens missing and there were feathers all over the place,” said Sonia Hernandez.\n\nHernandez said her mother-in-law was especially upset about the missing cats.\n\n“She was going to have babies soon,” Hernandez said about one of the cats.\n\nBelieving a coyote was responsible, Hernandez’s father-in-law built a cage trap and set it on the property.\n\nOn Thursday night, Hernandez’s husband checked the trap and found a mountain lion calmly lying inside.\n\n“So he woke everybody up, and we got up, and we were all surprised how big it was and how it looked,” Hernandez said.\n\nHernandez said her immediate concern was for her three children, ages 5 to 9.\n\nShe said that she and her family breathed a sigh of relief, then wondered what to do next after having a mountain lion in their possession.\n\nHernandez called 911. On Friday morning, state wildlife officials, including a warden, arrived at the home. The cougar was released from the trap and ran off.\n\nThe decision to release the animal surprised and frustrated the family, who had expected it would be relocated far from their rural neighborhood.\n\n“We weren’t really happy about that because of our children and animals,” Hernandez said.\n\nSome neighbors shared those concerns.\n\nJeanette Villegas, who owns horses on her property, said she worries the mountain lion could return.\n\n“Releasing that animal knowing it has a food source, I believe it may come back,” Villegas said. “And I walk the property in the evening to check on my animals, and who knows if it’s watching me. It could be lurking behind a building, a bush, anything.”\n\nHernandez said she understands that wildlife officials must follow protocol, even if she disagrees with the outcome.\n\n“The way they explained it to us, hopefully he doesn’t, but we do have that fear it will come back,” she said.\n\nAccording to wildlife officials, state law requires that any mountain lion that is privately trapped must be released in the same general area where it was captured.",

    "fullText": "More than 20 towns with large warehouses have become stealth targets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's $45 billion expansion of detention centers. Some communities complain that ICE isn't telling them anything until after it has purchased space for thousands of detainees. In some cases, warehouse owners are refusing to sell.\n\nA look at some of the locations:\n\nLocal officials were told nothing before ICE purchased a 418,000-square-foot (38,833-square-meter) warehouse in the Phoenix suburb of Surprise for $70 million, the state’s top prosecutor, Kris Mayes, said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nDocuments later provided by ICE said the Department of Homeland Security estimates it will spend $150 million retrofitting the facility into a 1,500-bed processing site.\n\nA TV reporter in Orlando spotted private contractors and federal officials last month touring a 439,945-square-foot (40,872-square-meter) industrial warehouse. ICE senior adviser David Venturella told a WFTV reporter the tour was “exploratory.”\n\nOrlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said in a statement that the city hasn't been contacted by the federal government and that it has no legal options to stop a possible ICE facility.\n\nICE bought a massive warehouse in Social Circle for $128.6 million. The city said it has been informed that the facility is expected to house from 7,500 to 10,000 detainees and will be constructed using a modular design so that capacity can be scaled up or down as needed.\n\nPlans also are in the works to convert a warehouse in Oakwood into an ICE processing facility, Republican U.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde said in a statement, although no deed has been filed. City Manager B.R. White said his first inkling that a deal was imminent came when a warehouse supervisor told a city inspector he’d been instructed to clear the job site to make way for the new owners — the federal government.\n\nAfter the town of Merrillville raised concerns about ICE touring a new 275,000-square-foot (25,548-square-meter) warehouse, owner Opus Holding LLC sent a letter stating it isn't negotiating with federal officials for the property. The letter said Opus was limited in what it could share because of legal issues.\n\nICE purchased a warehouse about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Baltimore for $102.4 million, a deed signed last month shows. The deed was unearthed by Project Salt Box, a Maryland ICE watchdog.\n\nOfficials in Washington County said in a Facebook post that DHS notified them beforehand that it was considering purchasing the warehouse for use as a “new ICE Baltimore Processing Facility.” County commissioners later passed a resolution in support of ICE activities.\n\nICE announced its purchase of a facility in Romulus after the deal was completed. The city responded in a Facebook post that officials were concerned about the “lack of prior notification.”\n\nThe owners of warehouses in the Minneapolis suburbs of Woodbury and Shakopee pulled out of possible ICE deals after public outcry, according to local officials.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker posted that Noem agreed to look elsewhere after local elected and zoning officials opposed a possible detention center in the town of Byhalia.\n\nAfter weeks of public pressure, development company Platform Ventures announced it would not move forward with the sale of a massive warehouse in Kansas City.\n\nRepublican Gov. Kelly Ayotte sparred with federal officials after ICE disclosed plans to spend $158 million to convert a warehouse in Merrimack into a 500-bed processing center.\n\nThe issue came to a head when interim ICE Director Todd Lyons testified that DHS “has worked with Gov. Ayotte” and provided her with an economic impact summary.\n\nAyotte said the assertion was “simply not true.” She said the summary was sent hours after Lyons testified. The document erroneously refers to the “ripple effects to the Oklahoma economy” and revenue generated by state sales and income taxes, neither of which exist in New Hampshire.\n\nRoxbury said Friday that ICE had closed on the sale of a warehouse despite it offering tax abatements to the owner to stop the purchase.\n\nNo property documents were yet available online showing the price of the sale. The announcement came just two days after ICE said it had made a “mistake” when it previously announced the purchase.\n\n“Let us be clear: Roxbury Township will not passively accept this outcome,” the mayor and city council wrote in a news release.\n\nICE said Tuesday it made a mistake when it announced the purchase of a vacant warehouse in Chester. New York state Assemblyman Brian Maher said Friday that ICE is no longer considering the facility.\n\nOklahoma City Mayor David Holt announced last month that property owners had informed him they are no longer engaged with DHS about a potential acquisition or lease of a warehouse.\n\nDHS purchased a warehouse in Tremont Township for $119.5 million and one in Upper Bern Township for $87.4 million. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has said his administration will fight DHS' plans to convert the warehouses in rural parts of eastern Pennsylvania into immigrant detention and processing centers.\n\nIn the El Paso suburb of Socorro, ICE paid $122.8 million for a trio of warehouses that span 826,780 square feet (76,810 square meters). ICE also paid $66.1 million for a 639,595-square-foot (59,420-square-meter) warehouse in San Antonio. The mayors of both cities are opposed.\n\nHowever, another deal in the state was scuttled following community backlash. In the Dallas suburb of Hutchins, a real estate company confirmed that it was contacted about one of its properties but wouldn't sell or lease any buildings to DHS for use as a detention facility. California-based Majestic Realty Co. provided no explanation in its statement.\n\nSalt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall expressed gratitude in her State of the City address that the owners of a warehouse that ICE was eying as a detention facility had announced plans not to sell or lease the property to the federal government.\n\nJim Pattison Developments said in a statement last month that it became aware of the intended use of a warehouse in the suburbs of Richmond, Virginia, after agreeing to sell to a U.S. government contractor. Following boycott threats, the Vancouver-based company announced that the transaction “will not be proceeding.”",

    "fullText": "With sensors that cool the air as it nears your head, this high-end tool promises gentler styling for sensitive scalps\n\nThe best hair dryers for smooth, speedy styling at home\n\nTell most hair-care enthusiasts you want to upgrade your hair dryer, and I’d bet good money you’ll be asked, “Will you buy a Dyson?” That would have been a ludicrous question more than a decade ago when the brand specialised in vacuum cleaners, but not since it took the luxury hair-care market by storm in 2016 with its Supersonic hair dryer.\n\nThe Supersonic ripped up the hair-dryer rulebook, with its distinctive design, lightweight feel and quiet operation. Eight years after the original, Dyson launched the Supersonic Nural: an upgraded version with new tricks up its sleeve.\n\nUpgrading to one of the best hair dryers is still one of my top beauty tips: they’re better at controlling heat levels and dry hair faster. All the same, is there really any need to spend up to £400?\n\nHaving put the Supersonic Nural hair dryer through its paces and compared it with 19 other hair dryers that I tested, I was mostly impressed. Still, a few niggles ensure it’s not a recommendation without caveats.\n\nOver the month I tested the Supersonic Nural, I took note of the look, feel and finish of my hair. I timed how long it took to rough-dry hair and achieve a smooth blow-dry, and judged the effectiveness of the scalp-protect mode, as well as the versatility and intuitiveness of the controls for more precise styling.\n\nI also used all of the attachments. In each case, I was hoping to dry my hair quickly, leaving it with minimal frizz and feeling healthy. Comfort was also a factor: I didn’t want my arms to ache or to feel any wrist strain in use.\n\nFor more quantitative test results, I used an anemometer to measure the Supersonic Nural’s top wind speed, plus a sound meter to assess noise levels from 15cm away. I popped this data into my comparison spreadsheet to see how the hair dryer measured up to the competition.\n\nDyson hair dryers are notoriously expensive. Prices start at £219 for the original Supersonic with its concentrator nozzle attachment, and climb to £450 for the latest Supersonic R hair dryer – the smallest, lightest and most powerful model that Dyson offers.\n\nSitting slightly below the Supersonic R is the £400 Supersonic Nural. As with its stablemates, it comes with intelligent heat control to prevent the excessive temperatures that can damage hair, and uses Dyson’s patented Air Multiplier technology to draw in surrounding air through the ring shape, for a claimed three times more airflow over models with a conventional shape.\n\nThe Nural uses the Dyson Digital Motor V9, the same motor as the original Supersonic. This is marginally heavier and less powerful than the Hyperdymium motor in the brand’s Supersonic R hair dryer, but still spins at a whopping 110,000 RPM. That’s plenty fast enough for most people.\n\nOn a basic level, the Nural has three speed levels, three heat settings and a continuous cool shot. All these can be controlled by small buttons on the rear of the dryer, alongside a button that turns scalp-protect mode on and off. On the handle, there’s a dedicated cool shot button and a power switch. It has a 2.62m cord, which is perfect for home use.\n\nThe most tangible difference between the original and the Nural is its scalp-protect mode. This sees the device adjust the temperature of the air based on the dryer’s proximity to the scalp: the closer it gets, the lower the temperature goes. This means you never burn your scalp or frazzle any of the delicate new strands as they grow. Dyson claims this strengthens the scalp barrier, balances oils on the scalp, and reduces visible flakes and shedding.\n\nAnother clever addition is pause detect, which automatically slows the dryer down when it’s placed on a surface. This is ideal for those who section their hair while drying, or place the dryer down during a round-brush blow-dry.\n\nDyson offers eight different magnetic attachments for the Nural. Whether you buy the version for straight and wavy or for curly and coily hair, you’ll find five attachments in the box, with others available to buy separately.\n\nAll the Nural’s attachments have RFID tags that are programmed with the ideal heat and speed settings, eliminating any guesswork on the user’s part. If you prefer to tweak the settings, it will then remember these the next time you use that attachment.\n\nThat, alongside the high-end design, is one of the main reasons to invest in a Dyson hair dryer over other high-end options. Most of its competitors only include a concentrator nozzle and diffuser, with the closest equivalent in attachment range being the £220 Shark SpeedStyle Pro. The Shark also features a Scalp Shield mode, but it’s not automatic or proximity-based like the Nural’s. Instead it’s activated via a button on the handle (so no different from simply reducing the temperature on any old dryer).\n\nPower: 1,600W\nMotor speed: 110,000 RPM \nTemperature settings: three, plus a cold shot\nSpeed settings: three\nAttachments: \n\n Straight + Wavy version: diffuser, flyaway smoother, smoothing nozzle, gentle air attachment, concentrator nozzle\nCurly + Coily version: gentle air attachment, wave+curl diffuser, wide-tooth comb, flyaway attachment, concentrator nozzle\nWeight: 485g (without wire)\nMaximum wind speed (tested): 29.2m/s\nVolume range (tested): 75-81dB\n\nThere’s much to like about the Supersonic Nural. Its design is attractive – it’s made from a lightweight-but-sturdy plastic, with a metallic finish that screams high-end. I tested the Nural in the limited-edition Amber Silk colour, but it’s also available in blush pink, navy or dark blue. There have been various limited-edition colours, too, so it’s always worth checking the Dyson website before you buy.\n\nIts vegan leather presentation case – which is free in some limited editions, but costs £60 separately – is another luxury. It houses all the attachments – bar one, which I’ll moan about momentarily. If you prefer to ditch the case, the dryer is compact enough to fit in most vanity drawers.\n\nThe Nural is staggeringly quiet, with volume levels ranging between 75 and 81dB in my tests. That makes it the second quietest hair dryer I’ve tested, just a touch louder than the Cloud Nine Airshot Pro on its fastest settings.\n\nI adored the scalp-protect mode, which made drying my hair comfortable and allowed me to disengage during the process. This isn’t a luxury I get with most hair dryers, which require me to manually lower the temperature at the scalp, or suffer the consequences.\n\nThe dryer took about seven minutes to rough-dry my hair, which is a few minutes slower than the most powerful hair dryers I’ve tested. However, my hair was left feeling smooth and healthy, with the flyaway attachment quickly handling any rogue hairs for an effortless finish that lasted until my next wash. The magnetic attachments were easy to swap, and the automatic settings meant I could make the most of them without faff.\n\nI’m not a fan of doing round-brush blow-drys: I haven’t quite got the knack of using a round brush, so I’m often left sweating profusely, with my arms feeling as if I’ve done 40 reps by the end. But the Supersonic Nural’s lightweight, evenly weighted design made sure my arms and wrists didn’t feel the strain, even when tackling the tricky spots on the top of my head. And when sectioning my hair, the pause detect was an invaluable little luxury that I’ll miss when I’m using a different hair dryer.\n\nThe results from the blow-dry were beautifully smooth, with plenty of volume where I wanted it. The Dyson’s speed settings provided extra control when styling the shorter hairs that frame my face, and the cool shot set the style quickly. My hair felt noticeably smoother than usual, thanks to having been dried with more gentle heat.\n\nLet’s start with the obvious: the Supersonic Nural is expensive. At full price, you’ll be splashing out about £400 (although you could find one for about £300 at the time of writing). There’s definitely no need to spend that much, with plenty of equally powerful options available for less in our test of the best hair dryers.\n\nIf you have a sensitive scalp and are tired of accidentally scorching it, no other hair dryer offers the same automation as Dyson’s scalp-protect mode. That said, the sensor isn’t flawless. During testing, it would sometimes lower the temperature when there was no need to. Mercifully, it never incorrectly increased the temperature in my tests, but I found the random lower temperatures slightly frustrating, since this added to overall drying times. You can easily disable scalp protect mode, of course, but you’d be missing out on one of the key selling points.\n\nAnother gripe was that the presentation case – as gorgeous as it looks – didn’t have enough space to store all the attachments. No matter how much rejigging I did, I couldn’t get the diffuser attachment to fit, meaning I had to let it gather dust on top of the case. For a case this expensive, that isn’t good enough.\n\nFinally – and this is nitpicking – when I unboxed the hair dryer, I was prompted to download the MyDyson app. Now, I’m not a fan of having random apps clogging up my phone, but I will be happy to do so if useful features are on offer. Sadly, all you get with the Supersonic Nural is styling and maintenance advice – which is available online. If you buy the Nural, do yourself a favour and skip the app.\n\nAll Dyson hair-care products, including the Supersonic Nural, are covered by a two-year warranty. During that time, Dyson will repair or replace your hair dryer if it stops working. You can also buy spare parts and replacement attachments from Dyson, which arrive with a one-year warranty.\n\nAs with all Dyson hair stylers, the Nural has a filter that needs cleaning once a month, or when you see the LED cleaning light switch on. This is easy to do: remove the filter cover at the bottom of the hair dryer’s handle and gently clear out any dust with a small cleaning brush. If necessary, you can use soapy water, but you’ll need to wait for the filter to fully dry before reassembling. Full cleaning instructions can be found in the instruction manual or on Dyson’s YouTube channel.\n\nYou can also find product-specific troubleshooting tips on the Dyson support page, which is exactly where you’ll be directed if you Dyson also has a helpline (0800 298 0298) where you can book a repair if your model is under warranty.\n\nIf your Dyson kicks the bucket after its warranty expires, all isn’t necessarily lost. Secondhand sites such as Sell My Dyson will buy old Dyson hair dryers, to stop all the parts from going to waste.\n\nThere’s no getting past it – the Supersonic Nural is a brilliant hair dryer that is well suited to people with sensitive scalps. Scalp burn and frazzled hair will be a thing of the past; it’s staggeringly quiet with an attractive design, a clever pause-detect feature and a brilliant range of attachments. It’s a clear cut above hair dryers of old. Whether that’s worth £400 will, of course, depend on your budget.\n\nI’m not convinced. In fact, you can get a very good hair dryer for far less. For less than £150, you can buy the Head Jog Futaria hair dryer, which is lighter and faster. Or you could opt for the reliable Hershesons hair dryer, which is my top pick for most people. However, if you want to splash out on a luxury hair dryer and you have a sensitive scalp, you certainly won’t regret buying the Supersonic Nural.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best hair dryers for smooth and speedy styling\n\n The best hot brushes for a salon finish at home\n\n The best hair straighteners for foolproof styling\n\nSarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in health and beauty reviews.

While the captain might not quite be in midseason form, he obviously feels good as he prepares for meaningful games earlier than normal with the World Baseball Classic looming in early March.\n\nThe Mets, on the other hand, got virtually no offense in their spring opener Saturday against the Marlins. One of their many newcomers, former Dodgers catcher Austin Barnes, got the lone hit for a Mets starter in a lineup that included Bo Bichette, Marcus Semien and Juan Soto, among others.\n\nSunday will see Luis Gil get the ball for the Yankees and Justin Hagenman for the Mets, with multiple pitchers to follow on each side.\n\nHere's everything you need to know to watch.\n\nLive streams:Fubo, Gotham Sports\n\nThe Yankees vs. Mets Grapefruit League game will be broadcast nationally by MLB Network and can be streamed via Fubo for out-of-market viewers. The game will stream live via the Gotham Sports app in the New York market.\n\nFubo offers a free trial for new subscribers, so you can try the service before you buy.

They will next play England and Sri Lanka. If Pakistan manage to win both matches, they will reach five points, which should be enough to book a place in the semi-finals. \n\nHowever, if they lose even one game, their chances become tricky. One win and one loss would leave them on three points, and then they would have to depend on other teams’ results. \n\nIf Pakistan lose both remaining matches, they will be knocked out of the tournament.\n\nNew Zealand are in the same boat. \n\nThe rain has given them a point, but they will still need wins in their upcoming matches to stay in control of their destiny. \n\nAny slip-up could pull them into a tight battle with the other teams in the group.\n\nSince this was the first Super 8 match for both Pakistan and New Zealand, the full picture will only become clear once all teams have played at least one game. \n\nBoth sides were seen as favourites to reach the semi-finals, but the washout has made their path harder and kept the group wide open.",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace return to Selhurst Park this afternoon, desperate to banish the ghosts of their recent collapse and secure a vital win against a resurgent Wolverhampton Wanderers side.\n\nThe Eagles enter this match following a quick turnaround after a 1–1 draw against HSK Zrinjski Mostar in the Europa Conference League on Thursday. Domestically, they are looking to respond to a crushing 3–2 defeat to Burnley in their last home outing, where they surrendered a two-goal lead despite a brace from new signing Jørgen Strand Larsen. Despite winning just one of their last 11 Premier League matches, Palace remain eight points clear of the drop zone.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers, meanwhile, travel to the capital buoyed by a dramatic 2–2 comeback draw against league leaders Arsenal. Though they remain bottom of the table with just 10 points, Rob Edwards’ side is now three matches unbeaten across all competitions. However, the “Old Gold” face a significant mental hurdle at Selhurst Park, a venue where they have suffered five consecutive top-flight defeats.\n\nLast Meeting: Wolves 0–2 Palace (22 Nov 2025), Premier League\n\nOliver Glasner is managing a significant injury list, with Cheick Doucouré, Eddie Nketiah, and Jean-Philippe Mateta all confirmed absentees. Jefferson Lerma also remains sidelined following an injury against Burnley. Defenders Maxence Lacroix and Chadi Riad both face late fitness tests after sustaining knocks during the midweek trip to Bosnia.\n\nRob Edwards received a boost with Angel Gomes passed fit after a back issue kept him out of training earlier this week. Captain Toti has returned to training following a long-term hamstring injury and could be involved, but Hwang Hee-chan remains out with a calf problem.\n\nThe Eagles have struggled for consistency at Selhurst Park, winning just 37.5% of their Premier League points at home this season. Their last league outing at home saw them throw away a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to Burnley. Notably, Palace are currently winless in their last eight Premier League home games, their longest such run since 1997. However, they boast a formidable record against Sunday’s visitors, having won their last five consecutive home league games against Wolves.\n\nThe Magpies of the Midlands arrive full of confidence after going three matches unbeaten, including the spirited 2–2 draw with Arsenal. Following a draw with Nottingham Forest and an FA Cup win over Grimsby, Rob Edwards’ side is showing signs of a fightback. Notably, however, Wolves remain winless in their last 15 Premier League away games and are the only side in England’s top four tiers without a road win this term. They have also struggled in the capital, winning just one of their last 11 away league games against London sides.\n\nCrystal Palace Predicted XI: Henderson; Richards, Canvot, Riad; Munoz, Wharton, Kamada, Mitchell; Sarr, Pino; Strand Larsen\n\nWolves Predicted XI: Sa; Mosquera, Bueno, Krejci; R. Gomes, J. Gomes, Andre, Mane, H. Bueno; Arokodare, Armstrong\n\nThe match will be televised live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League. Fans can also stream the action via the Sky Go app.\n\nRead more- Andrews makes big Brentford claim following Brighton defeat\n\nSee Also- Scott Parker ‘proud’ as Burnley snatch draw against Chelsea\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRyan Garcia was sleepwalking against Rolando Romero in the middle of Times Square. In Las Vegas, he was Mario Barrios’ nightmare as he pitched a shutout to win the WBC welterweight title.\n\nA reserved Garcia (25-2), who acted cool, calm, and collected through fight week, surprised many by using his right hand to control the fight from beginning to end.\n\nIt’s been a rough few years for Garcia. He lost to Gervonta Davis, had a win against Devin Haney negated after missing weight, was suspended for failing a drug test, and was dropped against Romero. Now, “KingRy” can officially be called that after winning his first world title.\n\nGarcia started the fight by dropping Barrios (29-3-2), using his right hand to punish his opponent. He stayed in the middle of the ring through the fight, countering everything Barrios had to offer. He switched between the left and right hooks, even after injuring the latter hand in the middle of the fight.\n\nEvery time Barrios tried to press forward, Garcia swung and provided damage. It was a perfect performance from Garcia, who dedicated the win to his father. His father was his trainer, while his former trainer, Joe Goossen, cornered Barrios.\n\nGarcia, a champion at 147, earned his first official win since 2023. He called out Shakur Stevenson, champion at 140, after the fight. He could also face Haney, the WBO welterweight champion, in a rematch.\n\nRYAN JUST CALLED OUT SHAKUR‼️👀#TheRingHighStakes | LIVE NOW | Live Exclusively on DAZN | @ringmagazinepic.twitter.com/bpcyvCuPTV\n\n— DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 22, 2026\n\nAfter fighting his last two opponents to a draw, Barrios earned his first loss since 2022.\n\nAndy Hiraoka seemed to have had 72 hours to come to the U.S. to fight for the first time since 2024. He managed to surprise against a somewhat tentative Gary Antuanne Russell. With the WBA super lightweight title on the line, Russell managed to retain his belt.\n\nHiraoka (24-0) started slow, but then picked things up in the later rounds. Russell (19-1) struggled to find momentum, which upset his team, including his brother, Gary Russell Jr. Later, Hiraoka’s momentum was lost following a very clear low blow, resulting in a point deduction. The two continued to land hard shots until the final bell.\n\nRussell, appearing low in the Ring rankings, now hopes for unification fights.\n\nMORE: Why Terence Crawford won The Sporting News' Men's Fighter of 2025\n\nFrank Martin and Nahir Albright gave it their all for ten brutal rounds. Martin looked sharp to start, but Albright surprised and even gained an edge. Martin landed flurries in round five, but Albright pushed forward in round seven, the best round of the fight and night.\n\nAlbright (17-2-1) could have won the fight in the tenth after hitting shots that hurt Martin (35-5-1), but his mouthpiece came out twice. Those few seconds saved may have helped Martin. The fight ended in a draw, with fans giving both a standing ovation. Will there be a rematch?\n\nBektemir Melikuziev became the top contender for the WBA super middleweight title after pulverizing Sena Agbeko. Melikuziev (17-1) brutalized his opponent, who proved to have a hard chin.\n\nThe corner of Melikuziev was upset that he wasn’t taking advantage of clean shots. Agbeko was game for a war, but it wasn’t until later in the fight that his body finally gave in. After a right hook dropped him, the referee called the fight off following another onslaught. Melikuziev has now won ten straight.\n\nMORE: Tyson Fury condemned to be boxing's miracle man who runs out of miracles\n\nMulti-time amateur champion Amari Jones is considered a blue-chip prospect. The 23-year-old looked like the future of the sport as he broke down the body of Luis Arias.\n\nReplacing Richardson Hitchins vs. Oscar Duarte on the main card, Jones (16-0) went for the knockout multiple times, digging into the body and dropping Duarte multiple times. It was Arias’ corner that eventually stopped the fight, allowing their fighter to see another day.\n\nThe Sporting News provided results, analysis and highlights from the entire Ryan Garcia vs. Mario Barrios fight card.\n\nRyan Garcia def.

    "fullText": "Catarina Macario was immaculate last year. The leading goalscorer for the USWNT showcased her ability to hold up play, connected across generations with international teammates and found the back of the net eight times in 10 appearances with two assists. Three of those goals came in the last two months of 2025 as the U.S. finished the year with two friendlies against Italy.\n\n“It has been a good year. It has been a year that I’ve tried to find some consistency,” Macario told TNT Sports at the time. “I’m still trying to find my rhythm and whatnot, but it’s been good.”\n\nTwo months into the year, however, and the picture looks different.\n\nMacario picked up another injury in late December that has kept her out of Chelsea’s Champions League squad, as well as the latest U.S. roster for next month’s SheBelieves Cup. That Macario is currently unavailable for selection has only exacerbated the question of her professional future; the 26-year-old’s contract with Chelsea expires in four months.\n\nMacario’s decision about her future carries high stakes. Here is what we know so far.\n\nChelsea face Arsenal in the quarterfinals of the Women’s Champions League next month. The reigning WSL champions look to right the ship against the reigning continental champions after a period of poor form and internal tension among Chelsea’s top brass.\n\nMacario, though, won’t be playing. She was left off Chelsea’s roster for the tournament, which was published on Feb. 7, due to a heel injury.\n\nThe Brazilian-American striker’s future has been a prolonged topic of discussion over the past two months. Her contract with Chelsea is set to expire this summer and with the World Cup in Brazil 16 months away, Macario’s next move will be critical.\n\nThe forward, who has been dealing with injuries for much of the season, last featured for Chelsea on Dec. 10 in a Champions League match against Roma. The week prior, she was with the U.S. for a pair of friendlies against Italy in Florida, scoring three goals across the two fixtures.\n\nShe has not been on the pitch since.\n\n“Cat had some heel pain before Christmas and she’s managing that,” Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said on Jan. 16 ahead of the FA Cup game against Crystal Palace. “She’s progressing in her rehab and heading in the right direction, but won’t be available for the weekend.”\n\nQuestions continued as Macario was left off of the USWNT roster for the SheBelieves Cup, which runs from March 1-7 and features matches against Argentina, Canada, and Colombia.\n\n“My understanding is that there has been a heel injury that I think she’s getting closer and closer with every day, but she’s not available for selection yet at Chelsea,” U.S. head coach Emma Hayes said after announcing her roster. “I don’t know when that is going to come. I don’t know if it’s one week, two, three weeks away, but I know she’s not available for selection.”\n\nHayes has experimented heavily with the U.S. roster; she capped 44 players in 2025 alone and awarded 16 debuts. While that phase of her development is over for this cycle, Hayes said she still sees Macario fitting into her depth chart, even while injured.\n\n“Honestly, if Cat Macario and Sophia Wilson were fit for selection, they would have been selected as the nines,” she said, adding an update for fellow forward Wilson, who missed 2025 on the field while pregnant with her first child.\n\nChelsea have had a turbulent season domestically. They sit third in the WSL, trailing front-runners Manchester City by nine points. Their 5-1 loss to the Manchester side on Feb. 1, which followed a 2-0 loss to Arsenal on Jan. 24, raised serious concern over Bompastor’s future with the club; the French manager had never lost two consecutive matches in her coaching career.\n\nBefore joining Chelsea, Bompastor coached OL Lyonnes, where Macario began her professional career. In 2021, the two won a Champions League title together. Macario signed with Chelsea in 2023 when Hayes was still managing the team. When Hayes departed for the USWNT in 2024, Chelsea hired Bompastor to replace her.\n\nBompastor guided the team to a domestic treble last season, but this season has been significantly more challenging on and off the pitch, with some sources describing to The Athletic a power struggle behind the scenes. On Feb. 6, Chelsea and Bompastor agreed to a contract extension that will run until 2030, a vote of confidence by the front office. Three days later, the team parted ways with former head of women’s football Paul Green, who had been with the club since 2013 and worked closely with Hayes.\n\nStill, it is unclear whether or to what extent these realities factored into Macario’s decision to reject Chelsea’s contract extension offer. As she enters what could be the peak of her career with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon — Macario’s first opportunity to win a major trophy with the U.S. — her next club will play a key role in her trajectory.\n\nMacario moving back to the U.S. for the first time since she played at Stanford University is a possibility, as The Athletic previously reported. The San Diego Wave are located in the area where she grew up after moving to the U.S. from Brazil when she was 12 years old.\n\nOne source told The Athletic that Macario had turned down Chelsea’s contract extension offer and said she also received offers from other European clubs. In order to protect relationships, the source spoke with The Athletic on the condition of anonymity. Another source said the San Diego Wave were front-runners to sign her.\n\nOn Feb. 13, ESPN reported that the Wave were in advanced negotiations to sign Macario. They reiterated that a deal had not yet been signed, but that Macario had expressed enthusiasm at the prospect of returning home and playing in the NWSL for the first time. The NWSL team declined to comment when approached by The Athletic. Macario is yet to publicly voice an opinion on her preferred next step, but the attraction of returning home and playing in the NWSL for the first time is clearly tempting from the outside.\n\nOn the sporting side, it makes sense for Macario to land somewhere she’s all but guaranteed substantial and consistent minutes on the pitch — something she was not able to do at Chelsea due in large part to injuries, including an ACL tear in 2022 and the nagging knocks that have occurred since.\n\nUnlike European leagues that lack evenly distributed competition, in the NWSL, Macario could find consistent game time and consistent competition. It could also be advantageous to experience the pace and physicality for which the NWSL is known.\n\nThe league allows incoming transfers up until March 16, three days after the first match of the season. The introduction of the High Impact Player rule, which allows NWSL clubs to spend up to $1 million above the salary cap on a player or players who meet predetermined qualifications, could also help an NWSL team sign Macario. The rule was established in December but is currently being disputed by the NWSL Players Association, which claims the rule misinterprets the “roster classification” as described in the league’s Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nMacario may decide to stay put at Chelsea until her contract is up this summer, but if she does have her sights set on the NWSL, it would behoove her to begin the season with them and give herself the extra time to adjust and gel, especially with Champions League play no longer a consideration for her and Chelsea’s hopes of a domestic title growing thin.\n\nMeanwhile, an early exit for Macario could benefit Chelsea, who could receive something in a transfer before the summer. After June, she becomes a free agent and could walk away on her own accord, and she’s not the only Chelsea player with contract talks on the horizon.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nUS Women's national team, Chelsea, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "Garcia dropped Barrios in the very first round, before winning a lopsided decision to collect the WBC welterweight belt",
    "fullText": "Ryan Garcia cruised to a lopsided decision win over Mario Barrios on Saturday, winning the WBC welterweight title in the process.\n\nGarcia dropped Barrios in the very first round, and while he could not replicate or better that moment as the fight wore on, he stayed in complete control throughout.\n\nAfter the final bell sounded, Garcia was declared a unanimous-decision winner (119-108, 120-107, 118-109), as he became a full world champion for the first time.\n\nThe precocious 27-year-old previously held an interim world title at lightweight, but Saturday marked a grander triumph for “King Ry”, as he dethroned Barrios in Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena.\n\nGarcia is best known for his powerful, check left hook, but it was a clean right cross that scored a flash knockdown of his fellow American in the first round. A startled Barrios did well to recover, but the 30-year-old champion could do little more than that, failing to mount any meaningful offence as the fight progressed.\n\nGarcia, meanwhile, relied on that right cross a surprising amount, troubling his southpaw opponent with it time and again. Midway through the fight, Garcia’s father – his head coach – actually told DAZN that the young boxer’s right hand might be injured, but King Ry was using it again before long.\n\nStill, combination punching served him well, too, as he eased over the line in the final rounds, condemning Barrios to a third straight fight without a win; the champion had drawn his previous two bouts, including against a 46-year-old Manny Pacquiao last summer.\n\nConor Benn was expected to be next for the winner of the Vegas main event, with the British star holding the status of mandatory challenger. However, Benn’s shock departure from Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom has complicated the situation.\n\nOn Friday, it was announced that Benn was leaving Matchroom to join rival promotion Zuffa Boxing, which is led by UFC president Dana White and intends to move away from boxing’s traditional belts.\n\nWhatever is next for Garcia, Saturday’s win is the finest moment of his career – a career that has been far from straightforward.\n\nIn 2023, Garcia was stopped by Gervonta Davis; in 2024, his win over Devin Haney was overturned when Garcia failed a drug test; and in 2025, after returning from a year-long ban, he was dropped and outpointed by underdog Rolly Romero.\n\nBut Garcia looked to back to his best against Barrios, and he said after his win: “It feels great, man, but it feels better to be a child of God, to be honest. I dedicate this to my dad, though.\n\n“I wanted to show my full arsenal. I believe it was a kind of masterclass, but I should’ve got the finish. But I hurt my right hand, [and] Mario’s a tough warrior, a fellow Mexican-American. I hurt him multiple times, but like I said, he’s a tough son of a b***h.”\n\nGarcia also called for a showdown with compatriot Shakur Stevenson, who picked up the WBO welterweight belt in January by schooling Teofimo Lopez in New York City.\n\n“You know who I want,” Garcia said. “He’s right there: Shakur Stevenson. Let’s go, let’s run that s***. I’m not scared of anything.”",

    "fullText": "Overdependence on chatbots is a growing problem, and though your boyfriend’s ADHD may be a factor, he needs to find the root of his anxiety\n\nMy boyfriend of eight years, who is 44, has ADHD and runs his own business. He’s always struggled with admin and mundane tasks, but AI has revolutionised how he works. Now I’m worried he can’t seem to do anything without AI. He is a heavy ChatGPT user and uses it even when there’s a better non-AI alternative (eg he’ll ask it for train times rather than using Trainline, even though it’s less accurate). He just got his ChatGPT Wrapped and he’s in the top 0.3% of users worldwide.\n\nI worry about his ability to think independently, as well as the environmental impact. I know it’s a useful tool for him at work, but he uses it for everything in life.\n\nI’m very aware I can come across as quite naggy, and his ADHD can make him obsessive. I’d love some advice on how to approach this with him .\n\nRunning a business can be stressful, and although your boyfriend’s ADHD may be a factor, I wonder if he is anxious anyway and if his use of AI is a symptom rather than the cause.\n\nI took your letter to consultant clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst Dr Stephen Blumenthal and Henry Shelford, CEO of ADHD UK.\n\nBlumenthal wondered if we are “on the verge of a new diagnostic category of ‘chatbot overdependence syndrome’ as we head into an age in which we become increasingly reliant on AI. When used judiciously, AI aids us, but it could have disastrous consequences if we become dependent on it and lose the capacity for ordinary functioning.\n\n“Someone with ADHD has a shorter attention span, difficulty focusing and a reduced capacity to plan and think ahead, so AI is a perfect fit, which is why it can be so helpful. The downside is that there is a greater propensity to become overdependent on it.”\n\nShelford wondered if your boyfriend was struggling anyway, and if the AI provided a useful “flotation aid”? “AI can take you down a rabbit hole,” he said, “but it can also support you and help you structure your thoughts, schedule stuff and get things done.”\n\nYour boyfriend’s use of AI seems to go beyond this. It’s as if he’s doubting himself, and that can be pernicious.\n\nBlumenthal says: “Problems arise when your use of AI goes beyond satisfying the problem you wish to resolve. It feels as if a relationship with it has started to develop, and you imbue it with human qualities, a projection of our own wishes and desires for validation and care.”\n\nWhat to do? You’re right not to nag, which rarely solves anything, because it just becomes noise. As with all tender and difficult conversations, pick your moment when you’re both calm.\n\nShelford recommended asking your boyfriend, “‘What are you getting out of it? Why is this tool such a big deal and what are the gaps it’s filling?’ Then look to see if there are better solutions or better ways to use it.”\n\nBlumenthal thought: “as with any overdependence syndrome, there first needs to be recognition that there is a problem. It’s easy to become critical of the person who’s struggling, but that’s only likely to cause them to withdraw further into dependency. The case must be made compassionately, recognising that being without the scaffold of ChatGPT probably feels like a threat.”\n\nThe good news is that, unlike the generation now growing up with AI, your boyfriend has a track record of functioning well without it. Hopefully he can be reminded of that and find a place where AI augments the abilities he already has. But it sounds as if he’s anxious and I think the cause has to be found so you can both move forward.\n\nEvery week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

    "fullText": "Centerview Partners and former junior banker Kathryn Shiber have reached a settlement, ending a closely watched lawsuit about Wall Street work culture that was set to go to trial in Manhattan federal court on Monday.\n\nThe case centered on allegations that the boutique investment bank violated disability discrimination laws when it fired Shiber in 2020 after she said she needed eight to nine hours of sleep each night because of an underlying mood and anxiety disorder.\n\nCourt filings and depositions in the case offered a rare look into the grueling demands placed on first-year analysts, including testimony that they typically work between 60 and 120 hours a week and that \"in some projects, you are working 24 hours a day.\" Emails between Shiber and her higher-ups highlighted the unpredictable nature of the job, with her associate saying in one exchange that \"there will always be more for you to do.\"\n\nCenterview has denied wrongdoing.\n\n\"Centerview has said all along that Ms. Shiber's legal claims have no merit,\" a Centerview spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement. \"We were ready to prove that in court, and are confident we would have prevailed at trial. But we are nonetheless happy to put this distraction behind us and focus on delivering for our clients.\"\n\nThe resolution means a jury will not weigh in on questions about Wall Street's long hours and workplace accommodations, and that top bankers won't have to take the witness stand. Tony Kim, the co-president of the investment bank, was among those expected to testify.\n\nJunior bankers, more formally known as investment banking analysts, tend to be recent graduates starting at the bottom rung of Wall Street's high-stakes dealmaking operations. They are often charged with grunt work, such as reformatting pitch decks or gathering data for a more senior coworker.\n\nShiber joined Centerview in July 2020 and was assigned to an active deal nicknamed \"Project Dragon.\" After working till about 2 am for several days in a row, she logged oﬀ at around 1 am on a Friday without first communicating her plans to the team leads, court filings said. After she reached out to human resources, the bank granted her a work accommodation from midnight to 9 am, but dismissed her weeks later.\n\nTerms of the settlement were not disclosed. Lawyers for Shiber did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Donald Trump weighed in amid negotiations over the Warner Bros. deal, saying Netflix should fire Susan Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is calling on Netflix to remove former US Ambassador and national security advisor Susan Rice from its board, sharpening his criticism of the streaming giant as it seeks to merge with Warner Bros. Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump demanded that Netflix \"immediately terminate\" Rice from its board of directors, \"or pay the consequences,\" amplifying a message from right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Loomer had urged action against Rice, criticizing her role at the company and pointing to recent remarks she made about Trump and corporate America.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning themselves too closely with Trump. Speaking on Thursday on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and break the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\nThe clash comes as the streaming giant pursues a high-stakes merger that will require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nTrump in December said that Netflix had a \"very big market share,\" so its potential acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\"\n\nHowever, in February, he said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal and would defer to his Department of Justice to investigate the proposed merger, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEarlier this week, during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast, Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said that Trump hadn't asked for political concessions during discussions of the possible deal, but was focused on bringing jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.\n\nRepresentatives for Netflix and Rice did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "title": "The Longevity Scam",
    "description": "Pouring some cold water on cold plunges",
    "fullText": "The quest to live forever has fascinated humans for millennia. The Epic of Gilgamesh, composed about 4,000 years ago, follows a king who searches the world for a plant that can restore youth, only to lose the plant to a thieving snake. The (likely apocryphal) story of Juan Ponce de León, who is said to have embarked on a search for the Fountain of Youth in the early 16th century, refuses to die—unlike its protagonist, who was killed along his journey.\n\nToday’s longevity-medicine movement is driven by the same aggressive desire for eternal youth as the mythic stories of old. But whereas in earlier times ideas about wellness could travel only as fast as the people who held them, today just about anyone with an internet connection can use social media and AI-generated graphics to sell medical advice in seconds. Despite a decided shortage of placebo-controlled trials in humans to support that advice, the business of longevity is booming, thanks in large part to sleek direct-to-consumer marketing delivered by health influencers with far more confidence than evidence. By 2030, $8 trillion might be spent annually on longevity-related products.\n\nAs a sports-medicine physician, I see the consequences of the modern longevity obsession up close. Patients arrive at my office convinced that the right peptides, cold plunges, or lab tests can meaningfully extend their lives. They’re almost certainly headed for disappointment—if not harm.\n\nIn many ways, the American people owe a debt of gratitude to the early champions of longevity medicine. Throughout the 20th century, Western physicians focused primarily on treating disease rather than preventing it. But over the past 15 years or so, a new generation of longevity-focused clinicians began emphasizing lifestyle changes such as sleep, exercise, and healthy diet as first-line strategies for disease prevention—not necessarily to extend life, but to improve health. More recently, private investment has poured into the field in pursuit of flashier claims about staving off death. Many longevity-focused clinics and influencers have drifted from prevention toward profit, selling an expanding menu of unvalidated treatments.\n\nSome of the new advice is relatively harmless. Protein loading, for example, is unlikely to meaningfully extend one’s lifespan, but it is also unlikely to cause serious harm. Other trends are more concerning. I have seen patients experiment with drugs like rapamycin, an immunosuppressant medication prescribed for those who have undergone organ transplantation. Some health influencers claim, without convincing human-subject data to prove their point, that rapamycin slows cellular aging. Whether true or not, these claims have yet to be validated, but scientists do know that the side-effect profile of rapamycin includes an increased risk of infection and disease.\n\nRead: America has entered late-stage protein\n\nOther longevity enthusiasts are injecting or swallowing peptides, chains of amino acids that have been used in medicine for decades but are now becoming popular in their unregulated form. When prescribed by a physician, FDA-approved peptides such as insulin and GLP-1s can be remarkably effective. But no placebo-controlled human trials support the use of, say, “Wolverine” (scientific name BPC-157), a peptide that some influencers claim ramps up collagen production and aids tendon and ligament healing. Like many of the other non-FDA-approved peptides, anyone can order Wolverine online.\n\nAlong with supplements and drugs, excessive testing has become another pillar of the longevity movement. Apps, blood tests, and wearable devices purport to estimate customers’ “biological age” using metrics such as heart-rate variability, sleep scores, body composition, and biomarkers in blood. This type of “health score” does not predict how long a person will live, but it can provide a helpful snapshot of one’s current state of physiological health and inspire healthy behaviors.\n\nThe bigger issue is more intensive screenings, especially full-body MRI scans, which many longevity clinics have marketed as tools to detect disease early and thereby extend life. Although this sounds like a good idea, the availability of screening has outpaced its clinical relevance. MRI scans routinely reveal anatomical changes that are a normal part of the aging process. Research suggests that the overwhelming majority of adults past middle age have tears or cartilage changes in their knees, or tendon injuries in their shoulders. Similarly, liver and kidney cysts are commonly seen on MRI scans, especially in people over 50, and most are of no clinical significance; they’re common enough that researchers have dubbed them incidentalomas. But when such findings show up on an MRI, the risk of unnecessary surgery or other treatment increases drastically. Once a liver lesion is seen on MRI, for example, the patient will likely be advised to get a liver biopsy, a procedure with a 2.4 percent risk of major medical complication.\n\nRead: GLP-1 envy was just the beginning\n\nRecently, I treated a 48-year-old man for a routine sports injury. Almost as an aside, he mentioned that he had undergone a full-body MRI as part of a longevity program. The scan revealed a small lesion in his prostate. His PSA, the validated screening test for prostate cancer, was normal. Still, he was referred to a urologist, who felt compelled to biopsy the lesion because it appeared on the scan. The biopsy was benign, but the procedure left my patient unable to sit comfortably for weeks. “I wish I’d never done the MRI,” he told me.\n\nThe irony is that modern medicine has already succeeded at what the modern-day longevity movement claims to offer. Over the past 150 years, human life expectancy around the world has more than doubled, to numbers that Ponce de León could hardly have dreamed of. Clean water, sanitation, antibiotics, and vaccines have done more to extend human life than any supplement stack ever could. Cold plunges and red lights may feel empowering, but there is little evidence that today’s biohacking tools meaningfully extend the maximum human lifespan.\n\nA better—and more achievable—goal would be to extend healthy longevity, adding life to years instead of years to life. Scientists and doctors, for the most part, already know how to do this. Daily exercise and maintaining skeletal muscle volume as you age are among the most potent forms of preventive health care.\n\nFrom the January 2025 issue: America needs to radically rethink what it means to be old\n\nAfter decades of prescribing exercise as medicine to my patients, I tell them this: Move your body every day, and build muscles with weights or bodyweight exercises three times a week. Eat foods that you can recognize in nature. Prioritize sleep. Stay socially connected with community activities. Such a regimen may not enable you to cheat death. But it’s free. It’s evidence-backed. And it will help you live well right now.",

    "fullText": "Loughborough Lightning toppled last season's dominant force London Pulse 18-17 in the Netball Super Cup final as the new campaign got off to a thrilling start.\n\nDeposed by Pulse as Netball Super League (NSL) champions in the Grand Final last July, Lightning flipped the tables on their rivals who began a dominant 2025 by winning this event 12 months ago.\n\nThese two will be the teams to beat when the new league campaign begins on 27 February, with Lightning the team starting on a huge high.\n\nHead coach Vic Burgess said: \"It's been a really good day from us. We came into this knowing it's a little bit different. It can be tough and it can be quick, and Pulse nearly caught us.\n\n\"I'm really proud of the girls. They were up for it. They were chilled but with a focus on doing well for each other. The girls love winning and I love winning.\"\n\nThe one-day Super Cup features all eight NSL teams, split into two groups for round-robin matches before the semi-finals and final stage.\n\nThe 14-minute matches are far removed from the usual 60-minute games but it was a strong form guide last year when Pulse took the spoils and went on to triumph in the NSL for the first time.\n\nLightning co-captain Nat Panagarry said there had been a sense of \"feeling sorry for yourself\" after last year's Grand Final defeat, fuelling Saturday's win.\n\nLeeds Rhinos and Cardiff-based Dragons occupied the bottom two spots in the NSL last season but both reached the semi-finals here and looked revitalised.\n\nHowever, Nottingham Forest, preparing for a second season as a Netball Super League club, fell in the group stage after defeats by Loughborough and Dragons.\n\nGroup 1: Loughborough Lightning 23-21 Nottingham Forest, Dragons 18-6 Birmingham Panthers, Forest 14-12 Panthers, Lightning 18-15 Dragons, Dragons 15-9 Forest, Lightning 19-18 Panthers\n\nGroup 2: Leeds Rhinos 16-9 Manchester Thunder, London Pulse 15-8 London Mavericks, London Pulse 21-13 Manchester Thunder, Mavericks 13-13 Rhinos, Mavericks 19-8 Thunder, Pulse 13-12 Rhinos\n\nSemi-finals: Lightning 13-9 Rhinos, Pulse 18-16 Dragons\n\nInternational commitments over the winter months have interrupted pre-season preparations and that was a common message from coaches as some teams coped better than others on the big stage.\n\nIn front of packed stands at one of the UK's largest indoor arenas, Birmingham Panthers and Manchester Thunder both lost three from three.\n\n\"It's been a tough day,\" said Thunder coach Karen Greig, whose side lost their three games heavily to make an early exit.\n\nThunder will face NSL champions Pulse in the league's opening match, with more than 5,000 tickets sold for that Copper Box encounter.\n\nGreig has brought England goal shooter El Cardwell back to England after a successful stint in Australia while Thunder also have fellow Roses star Nat Metcalf back after she missed last season when pregnant and looking after baby son Miller.\n\nBut it was to no avail at the Super Cup.\n\n\"Today was about us understanding where we were actually at,\" Greig said.\n\n\"The performances and the connections on the court definitely highlighted that.\n\n\"The quality that we've got in our group is undeniable and it's about us now making sure we get everyone on the same page and connected.\"\n\nThere was no such problem for Lightning while Pulse took consolation from being a whisker away from another major title.\n\nAs Pulse coach Sam Bird said: \"I'm not too worried. I'm disappointed because I like winning everything available but I think we take a lot of positives from the day. It's a nice rivalry to continue with.\"\n\nHow Pulse won the 2025 Netball Super Cup\n\nEx-England netball boss Neville takes football job",

    "fullText": "A woman was sentenced to four years and four months in state prison for embezzling more than half a million dollars while she was employed as a bookkeeper for a Thousand Oaks medical practice, the Ventura County District Attorney’s Office announced Friday.\n\nIda Veronica Hernandez, 45, pled guilty on Jan. 21 to seven counts of felony grand theft and a felony count of filing a false or forged document, along with admitting to a special allegation that the losses exceeded $100,000.\n\nThe district attorney’s office said between 2020 and 2021, Hernandez transferred large sums of the businesses’ money into bank accounts controlled by herself and her relatives. They said she used multiple aliases.\n\nHernandez also directed the payroll company to pay her family and friends, along with other schemes.\n\nIn total, she stole at least $556,000 from the medical business.\n\n“I wish trusted employees that steal understood the devastation they leave behind,” Senior Deputy District Attorney Howard Wise said. “It’s not just financial. It’s the mental pain caused by disappointment and the frustration of having to unravel the records for months and sometimes years.\n\nThe investigation found Hernandez also committed identity theft against a co-worker after attempting to deflect attention from herself by falsely implicating the co-worker in her crimes.\n\nHernandez reportedly abruptly quit her job once financial irregularities began to surface.\n\nShe’s also accused of other financial crimes in Plano, Texas, where she abruptly fled and was later found by investigators as she traveled across the country.\n\nAlong with her sentence, Hernandez was ordered to pay restitution to the Thousand Oaks medical practice in the amount of $560,000.",

    "fullText": "A missing North Carolina mother who vanished in 2001 has been found alive, according to officials.\n\nIn a statement, the Rockingham County Sheriff's Office announced that Michelle Hundley Smith was located somewhere in North Carolina, adding that the woman’s \"current whereabouts will remain undisclosed” per her request.\n\nThe woman is not in any danger and doing well, police said, adding that her loved ones have been \"notified that she has been located and informed of this request as well.\"\n\nSmith, who is now 62, was last seen leaving her Eden home back on December 9, 2001.

    "fullText": "Quentin Griffiths, co-founder of online fashion retailer Asos, died after falling from a tall building in Thailand. He was 58.\n\nThe British-born man died Feb. 9 after the 17-story fall which occurred at a luxury condominium in Pattaya, according to Reuters.\n\nThai police told Reuters that initial investigations suggested suicide with no indications of foul play, and CCTV footage showed no one entering his apartment where he lived alone.\n\nPolice reported that Griffiths had been dealing with two ongoing court cases, including a legal dispute with his second wife over a business they ran together. Documents related to those lawsuits were found in his apartment, per the report.\n\nGriffiths co-founded Asos in London in 2000 with Nick Robertson, Andrew Regan and Deborah Thorpe. It was initially named “As Seen on Screen” before switching to the acronym in 2002.\n\nThe company grew to become valued at over £6 billion with designs worn by celebrities including Rihanna, Michelle Obama and Bella Hadid.\n\nGriffiths left Asos in 2005 but remained a large shareholder for nearly another decade and later co-founded several other ventures including online furniture store Achica, music-focused fashion retailer EBTM and ethical clothing website Adili.\n\n“We’re saddened to hear about the passing of Quentin, one of our original co-founders,” an Asos spokesperson said in a statement to BBC News. “He played an important role in Asos’s earliest days and we’re forever grateful for his contribution. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”",

    "title": "This Is The One Alzheimer's Warning Sign That People Mistake For A Character Flaw, And It's Actually Breaking My Heart",
    "description": "This mood-related issue is a common sign of the disease. Doctors share all you need to know about it.",
    "fullText": "Affecting roughly 72 million Americans firsthand, common symptoms include memory loss; struggling to plan, complete tasks, or solve problems; feeling confused; experiencing new problems with speaking and writing; misplacing items; making poor judgment calls; social withdrawal; and more.\n\nWhile those symptoms are ones we often hear about, they aren’t the only ones. There’s a symptom that many caregivers aren’t aware of and think is a result of “bad” caregiving: agitation.\n\n“It’s critical to first appreciate that agitation is a symptom of brain changes caused by Alzheimer’s disease, not poor caregiving,” said Dr. Richard Stefanacci, the medical director of Inspira LIFE, a senior living program.\n\n“The brain damage from Alzheimer’s makes people prone to agitation regardless of how loving caregivers are,” said Stefanacci, who also specializes in older populations and Alzheimer’s.\n\nAccording to information the Alliance of Aging Research sent to HuffPost, “agitation” in this sense can present itself in a variety of ways: pacing, trying to leave, angry outbursts, profanity, hitting, mood swings, throwing items and more. Caregivers may blame themselves, AAR continued, thinking it’s a result of their burnout, introducing a new routine or not being patient enough.\n\nDr. Nikhil Palekar, the director of the Stony Brook Center of Excellence for Alzheimer’s Disease at Stony Brook Medicine, said there’s a stigma when it comes to this specific symptom.\n\n“Caregivers often feel they might be doing something wrong, which is causing their loved one with Alzheimer’s to react in an uncooperative, hostile or agitated manner, without realizing that agitation in Alzheimer’s is very common, with rates ranging from 56% in early stages to 68% in the moderate-severe stage of the disease,” he said.\n\nLike with other Alzheimer’s symptoms, it all comes down to the brain.\n\n“Alzheimer’s disease is the result of brain damage to areas of the brain that control emotions, decision-making and behavioral responses,” Stefanacci said. “This neurological damage explains why people with Alzheimer’s may react strongly to situations that wouldn’t have bothered them before the disease progressed to this point.”\n\nMore specifically, we’re looking at neurotransmitters. “Alzheimer’s disease results in dysregulation and a decrease in three neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain — serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine — resulting in symptoms of agitation,” Palekar said. Keeping in mind that those neurotransmitters help with mood, motivation, energy, anxiety and more, this makes sense.\n\nWe also have to consider environmental factors. For example, the holiday season — or other high-commotion events — can exacerbate agitation and its causes.\n\n“Large gatherings with unfamiliar faces, disrupted routines, unusual foods and changes to previously familiar environments can cause agitation in someone with Alzheimer’s, especially [in] later stages of the disease,” Stefanacci continued. “Most critical is to make adjustments and accommodations to reduce the stress, such as maintaining routine and familiarity.”\n\nWhether you experience agitation from Alzheimer’s or love someone who does, know that hope is not lost. Below, doctors share tips and other helpful information that can help you manage this symptom together:\n\nConsistent daily schedules with meals, activities and bedtime are key, according to Stefanacci. When you do have to prepare your loved one for a change, he encourages doing it ahead of time if/when you can and trying to maintain other routines.\n\nIf the person with Alzheimer’s has a harmless belief, Stefanacci recommended not arguing with them about it. Rather, he said to focus on the emotion behind what they’re saying and remember that you can’t reason with an Alzheimer’s-damaged brain.\n\nWhile difficult at times, staying calm and helping the person with Alzheimer’s stay calm is important. Speak in a calm, reassuring voice, play familiar music they enjoy and reduce confusing noise, Stefanacci said.\n\nIt’s easy to feel hopeless when someone has Alzheimer’s, and to think that small interventions won’t make a difference. That’s understandable — and thankfully not true.\n\n“This symptom can be effectively treated with behavioral interventions as well as medication, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of agitation in Alzheimer’s disease,” Palekar said.\n\nTo get to that point, he recommended discussing any agitation-like symptoms with the patient’s medical provider.\n\nSimilar to the tips above, Palekar listed some specific, non-pharmacological interventions that can decrease agitation, too:\n\nMaintaining a daily routine and structure\n\nWalking (ideally outside in the sunlight)\n\nStaying busy with distractions, like snacks, objects, or fun activities\n\nAvoiding stimulants, such as caffeine, late in the day.\n\nBeing a caregiver is hard work, to understate it. Stefanacci urges these individuals to seek support from other caregivers, support groups and counseling. He also mentioned giving yourself permission to simplify or skip holiday traditions that are simply too overwhelming.\n\nIn short, it’s “normal” for someone with Alzheimer’s to show agitation — and that’s on Alzheimer’s, not anything the caregiver has done. As someone with Alzheimer’s or their loved one, know that you are not alone, and that people are available and want to support you.\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.\n\nAlso in Goodful: People Are Sharing The Less-Talked-About Hygiene Habits That They Wish Everyone Knew, And I Can't Believe Some Of These Even Need To Be Said\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Should’ve Gone To The Doctor Sooner\": People Are Sharing The Early Health Warning Signs They Regret Ignoring\n\nAlso in Goodful: People Are Sharing Their Biggest \"How Doesn't Everyone Know This?\" Facts, And I'm Honestly Embarrassed I Never Realized Some Of These",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump called on Netflix to fire one of its board members, Susan Rice, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser, following comments she made about accountability when Democrats return to power.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Saturday, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT”\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nTrump Indicates He’s Really Not Into Netflix Buying WB, Wants To Stop The Streamer’s So-Called “Cultural Takeover”\n\n'Real Time': Bill Maher Responds To Trump's Truth Social Rant, Jokes POTUS Expected Him To \"Put Out\" After Dinner\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThis week, Rice appeared on Preet Bharara’s podcast and said that, for corporate interests, law firms and media, “it is not going to end well for them. For those that decided that they would act in their perceived, very narrow self interest, which I would underscore as very short-term self-interest, and take a knee to Trump, I think they are now starting to realize, ‘Wait a minute, this is not popular. Trump is not popular.'”\n\nShe said that “there is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down. They are going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.”\n\nShe added, “If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, ‘Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,’ I think they got another thing coming.”\n\nReferring to Democrats, she said, “We are not going to play by the old set of rules when these guys are playing by a different set of rules. We are going to play by the law. We are not going to violate the law like they did. But we are not going to be suckers.”\n\nTrump linked to a post from Laura Loomer, who has for months lashed out at Netflix along with other MAGA influencers against the streaming giant’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros., citing in part the its ties to Barack Obama. Rice served as U.S. ambassador the the United Nations in Obama’s first term and national security adviser in his second.\n\nTrump told NBC News earlier this month that he would not be involved in deciding whether his administration will give regulatory approval to a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal or a competing bid from Paramount for all of Warner Bros. Discovery. But he previously said he would be involved, despite the long-held political norm of presidents keeping at arms’ length from the Justice Department.\n\nTrump has publicly offered praise for Ted Sarandos, the Netflix co-CEO, after meeting with him multiple times, including at a White House visit in November.\n\nSarandos appeared before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee at a hearing earlier this month, where he was pressed on the competitive impact of the transaction. But several Republicans on the committee pressed Sarandos on culture war issues, including content featuring transgender individuals, even though the DOJ is reviewing the merger for antitrust issues.\n\nParamount, meanwhile, has ties to Trump that include his longtime friend and investor, Larry Ellison, and his son, Skydance founder and the merged company’s CEO, David Ellison. Paramount’s chief legal officer, Makan Delrahim, led the DOJ antitrust division during Trump’s first term.\n\nRice’s point — that Democrats will hold companies accountable if they regain power — was underscored this week when a group of senators fired off a letter to David Ellison, asking him to preserve documents after he declined to answer questions about Paramount’s dealings with Trump.\n\nNetflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.

    "fullText": "Elon Musk’s supposed interest in buying the Seattle Seahawks has been trending on social media.\n\nThe speculation gained traction after a viral post claimed the billionaire was interested in purchasing the NFL franchise from the Estate of Paul G. Allen.\n\nHowever, the real story centres on the Seahawks’ formal sale process rather than unverified fan conjecture.\n\nIn a post widely shared across platforms, as posted by TheNFLDrop, it was claimed, “Elon Musk says he is interested in purchasing the Seattle Seahawks from the Estate of Paul G. Allen.\n\n“Musk has a net worth of $850 billion, and the Seahawks are looking to sell for over $10 billion.”\n\nThat post mixed true elements, namely that the Seahawks are entering the market, with speculation about Musk’s intentions that is not supported by credible reporting.\n\nNo major sports news outlet has confirmed Musk is in advanced talks or formally pursuing the franchise. Ideas about Musk as a suitor remain fan discussion rather than a verified fact.\n\nIt is also worth noting that reported net worth figures for individuals like Musk often vary significantly over time and are routinely updated by financial outlets, not fixed figures reported by NFL sources.\n\nWhat is verified is that the Seattle Seahawks are being put up for sale by the Paul G. Allen Estate following the team’s Super Bowl LX victory.\n\nThe potential price tag is likely to be in the multi-billion dollar range, reflecting the franchise’s strong performance, market value, and recent championship success.\n\nWhile speculation about specific prospective buyers, including national billionaires, is a frequent by-product of such high-value sales, these remain conjecture until official offers are publicly disclosed and verified.\n\nIn short, while the Seahawks are indeed on the market, there is currently no credible evidence that Elon Musk is formally pursuing the purchase.\n\nSeattle Seahawks yet to receive Donald Trump invite to White House after Super Bowl LX win\n\nNFL insider sets $7 billion as the floor for Seattle Seahawks’ sale after Super Bowl 60\n\nSeattle Seahawks unlikely to franchise tag Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III",

    "title": "Americans Are Uniquely Infatuated With Bald Eagles. Too Bad Most of Us Have No Idea What They’re Actually Like.",
    "description": "For one thing, there's the sound they make.",
    "fullText": "This piece is from Grizzled: Love Letters to 50 of North America’s Least Understood Animals by Jason Bittel. Copyright by the author © 2026 and reprinted with permission of National Geographic.\n\nThe bald eagle is an utter beast of a bird.\n\nWith a razor-sharp banana for a beak and a wingspan surpassing 6 feet, there aren’t many flying things on this continent that can top it. Heck, bald eagles may be even more impressive when sitting on the ground, where they approach heights of 3 feet or more—or about as tall as a human toddler. And if you ever get to watch one of these white-headed, brown-bodied predators pierce a still-gasping salmon with talons the size of your thumb and then shred that fish to bloody ribbons, well, you’ll understand why this descendant of the dinosaurs is a raptor to be reckoned with.\n\n“I always think that bald eagles sound like they’re giggling,” says Janet Ng, a wildlife biologist for the Canadian Wildlife Service. “A whistling kind of giggle.”\n\nThis isn’t the only thing we get wrong either. For though bald eagles are capable predators in their own right—they sport telescopic vision and can see in ultraviolet—they’re not above letting other animals do their work for them. In fact, Ben Franklin—scientist of the American Enlightenment and one of America’s Founding Fathers—famously argued against adopting the bald eagle as a national symbol for this very reason. The “Bald Eagle … is a Bird of bad moral Character. He does not get his Living honestly … [he] is too lazy to fish for himself,” wrote Franklin. And this is actually true.\n\n“Bald eagles are what we call kleptoparasites,” says Ng. “They’ll often steal food from other birds.” Despite what Franklin might have thought, however, being a klepto is nothing to be ashamed of (as an animal, at least; nation-states are another matter).\n\nIn the wild, animals do whatever they have to do to survive. Hyenas steal from lions. Lions steal from hyenas. Bears steal from squirrels. Bears steal from bees. Bees steal from each other. And on and on. You might even say kleptoparasitism makes the world go round.\n\nAnd hey, did you know that the word “raptor”—which is often used to describe birds of prey—comes from the Latin verb rapio, which means to plunder, rob, ravish, or abduct? So yeah, bald eagles are like pirates, swooping in and taking what they want, when they want it. But let’s not pretend doing so carries any sort of moral weight.\n\nWhen they aren’t thieving, bald eagles also scavenge from roadkill or help themselves to free food found in human garbage or at the town landfill. Again, none of this really means anything. You can know all of this and still love bald eagles and slap them all over T-shirts and bumper stickers and whatever else.\n\nBefore Europeans colonized North America, bald eagles were pretty much everywhere there was a river, lake, or stream large enough to support sizable fish. In fact, one written account from New England in 1668 said bald eagles were so plentiful as to be “infinite.” So much so, the colonists sometimes fed them to their pigs.\n\nThe bald eagle’s common name hails from around the same time period, and it doesn’t mean lack of hair. Rather, “bald” comes from the old English word “piebald,” which is still used today for horses, and means coloration of alternating dark and light. As in, the bald eagle’s dark brown body feathers versus its stark white head feathers. Oh, and those white feathers usually don’t fully come in until the birds reach their fifth year of age, so young eagles aren’t bald in either sense of the word.\n\nEstimates vary and usually only include the United States, but during the Colonial period, there would have been at least 50,000 breeding pairs and maybe up to as many as half a million bald eagles fluttering through the continent’s skies. Of course, this is also where things take a turn, because lots of folks just weren’t that fond of the birds.\n\n“Eagles get a bad rap sometimes, and we see this in lots of parts of the world,” says Ng. “Bald eagles scavenge on carrion, and so, if somebody goes out and they see a dead cow or a dead lamb and there’s a bald eagle sitting on top of it, then they immediately think the bird killed it.”\n\nSimilarly, in 1917, citing too much competition for their salmon harvest, the state of Alaska even instituted a bounty system that paid people to just go out and kill as many bald eagles as possible. A single eagle fetched $2 from the state government, or at today’s prices, nearly $50. At the same time, bald eagles were rumored to sometimes kidnap human babies and fly away with them in their talons. Throw in a feathered-hat fashion trend that swept the United States following the American Civil War, and frankly there were just too many incentives to go out and kill bald eagles. More than 120,000 eagles were slaughtered over the course of Alaska’s bounty system alone.\n\nAll of this would have been detrimental enough to the continental bald eagle population. But then, we started killing bald eagles even more efficiently, and entirely accidentally. When America entered World War II, wartime manufacturing instigated a shift from the United States’ main insecticide at the time, a naturally occurring compound known as pyrethrum, to another: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, or as we’ve come to know it, DDT.\n\nIn the years following WWII, DDT overtook pyrethrum as the most popular standalone insecticide, and it worked well at its task—killing insects and other arthropods by disrupting their nervous systems, all the while seemingly not hurting people. Of course, today we know that high-dose exposures to DDT can cause all kinds of illness in humans, including vomiting and seizures. It’s also a possible carcinogen. But back then, it was thought to be harmless to mammals. “There are pictures and videos of kids playing in plumes of DDT that the trucks would be releasing as they drove down the neighborhood roads,” says Ng.\n\nAnd another problem was silently brewing. “The trouble with DDT is that it stays in the environment, and it gets washed away into water, and then plants, and little animals like insects and fish eat those little bits of residue,” say Ng. Then, other fish eat those animals, and other animals eat those fish, and the pesticide just keeps concentrating as it moves up the food chain until, eventually, some of those poison-laced fish get eaten by a bald eagle (scientists call this process bioaccumulation).\n\nCuriously, DDT did not kill the birds outright, but rather caused their eggshells to collapse under the weight of the incubating adults. Fortunately, says Ng, scientists studying these birds noticed that hatch rates were flatlining, so even though bald eagles didn’t drop out of the sky en masse, scientists were able to identify the problem before it was too late. In 1972, the U.S. banned DDT under most circumstances. Canada followed suit beginning in 1985, as did Mexico in 2000.\n\nIt’s taken some time, but bald eagle populations have slowly bounced back from a low of just 417 nesting pairs anywhere in the U.S. in 1963 to around 316,700 bald eagles in the lower 48 states. And scientists estimate there are at least another 100,000 nesting pairs in Canada and Alaska.\n\nThe comeback has worked so well, Ng says lots of folks she encounters in Canada now don’t even realize the birds nearly disappeared. There’s a scientific phrase for that, too. It’s known as shifting baseline syndrome, and it refers to how we perceive what we see in the natural world—smaller fish, fewer insects, lack of large predators—to be the way it’s always been. But the bald eagles and their return shows that our baselines can also shift in the other direction.\n\nSo if you should be so lucky as to see a bald eagle harassing an osprey for a fish someday, or maybe tucking in to a deer carcass on the side of the road, take a moment to reflect. We nearly lost these massive, terrifying, sort of silly gigglers forever.",

    "description": "The Cleveland Browns will likely never see Jeramiah Owusu-Koramoah play ever again, coupled with the likelihood of Devin Bush leaving in free agency, and the Cleveland Browns may need to draft someone to help soothe the fire that's burning in Berea at the linebacker position.",
    "fullText": "3 Rookie linebackers that could soothe the Cleveland Browns after disappointing news originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSad news out of Berea, Ohio, as former Pro Bowl linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah is likely to never play again. The linebacker, who fans call 'JOK', has been out since mid-way in 2024, following a neck injury. The injury was significant, and Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com is reporting that the linebacker will likely never play again because of it. The loss of the versatile linebacker will hurt the Browns' defense long-term, as many had hoped he could come back in time. As one of the few, true, three-down linebackers, his impact on the Browns was undeniable.\n\nNow the Browns have a tough task ahead of them, with having to replace a rare three-down linebacker. The Browns did make moves with the idea they'd have to replace Owusu-Koramoah long-term. They went ahead and drafted Carson Schwesinger to help replace the lost production, which paid off. Schwesinger won the 2025AP Defensive Rookie of the Year Award due to his own versatility, helping the Browns' defense be one of the best in the NFL.\n\nHis addition was enough to keep the Browns from panic mode, but the hits to the defense keep coming. Now there is concern that Devin Bush, another high-level linebacker for the Browns, may be on his way out of Cleveland in search of a bigger contract. The Browns can't afford to lose Owusu-Koramoah and Bush in the same offseason and still expect the Browns defense to continue its elite ways. They'll need to add some talent. With the cap room for the team always a concern, turning to the draft for an affordable option makes the most sense.\n\nThese three players seem like perfect fits for what the Browns are hoping to accomplish next season, while also keeping in mind the other needs the team has to address.\n\nMore: Is JOK’s career over? Latest update on Browns LB Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah\n\n1. Jake Golday, Cincinnati University, Projected 2nd-3rd Round\n\nThe linebacker out of Cincinnati could be a huge addition to the Browns. As a prospect, he's 6'4, he'll likely be closer to 250 lbs by the time the season starts, and according to NFL Draft Buzz, runs a 4.55 40-yard dash. He's big, fast, and versatile, and would be the perfect fit alongside Schwesinger. It's likely you'd need to take him in the second or third round of the draft, which may not sit well with some. There's a belief that the Browns should consider the wide receiver and the offensive line as more pressing matters to address early. Yet, if you want a strong defense, you have to add the talent necessary to keep it going.\n\n2. Josiah Trotter, Missorui University, Projected late-2nd Round\n\nThere are a few players in the 2026 NFL Draft with the pedigree that this prospect has. The son of Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, Josiah Trotter, has proven himself to be a hot prospect. He's a little undersized, just like his dad was in his day, but he's considered one of the best prospects against the run at the linebacker position. Few draft hopefuls are expected to make as much of a positive impact against the run as Trotter. He does lack the pass-coverage skills needed to be a three-down linebacker, but next to Schwesinger, that flaw may not be such an issue.\n\n3. Lander Barton, University of Utah, Projected 6th-Round\n\nAt a massive 6'5, 240 lbs, Lander Barton could be a massive project for the Cleveland Browns to work with. He's had a solid run with the Utes, but a down senior year hurt his draft stock. PFF and NFL Draft Buzz both paint a picture of him being a jack of all trades, but a master of none. He excels at no specific thing, but he isn't bad at any one thing. He'll need some work, but his size and speed (rumored 4.55 40-time) could make him a digestible late-round pick. Some Browns fans want offensive help first, and if the team follows that path, Barton would be a nice project pick late in the process.\n\nFrom QB chaos to defensive studs: Re-grading the Browns wild 2025 NFL Draft class\n\nThe AJ Brown trap: Why Jeremy Fowler’s Browns trade proposal is a huge mistake\n\nBrowns 2026 win total revealed: Why you should hammer the over on Vegas odds\n\nDeshaun Watson 2.0?

    "fullText": "Jacob Bridgeman closed in on a first US PGA Tour title on Saturday, firing an impressive seven-under par 64 to take a six-stroke lead over world number two Rory McIlroy heading into the final round of the Genesis Invitational.\n\nBridgeman, who played the iconic Riviera Country Club course for the first time on Wednesday, made his way around like an old hand, matching the tournament's 54-hole record with a 19-under par total of 194.\n\nMcIlroy started the day one stroke behind co-leaders Bridgeman and Marco Penge but endured a tough day on Riviera's greens and finished with just three birdies and a bogey in his two-under 69 for 200.\n\nBridgeman, a 26-year-old American chasing his first PGA Tour title, was up by three after three birdies in his first four holes.\n\nHe picked up four strokes in the space of three holes to pull away for good. After rolling in a 12-foot birdie at the 10th he eagled the par-five 11th -- where he landed his 259-yard approach a foot from the pin. He drilled an 11-foot birdie putt at the 12th.\n\nMcIlroy, who completed his career Grand Slam at the Masters last year, admitted to some frustration as he found himself unable to put pressure on Bridgeman.\n\n\"The greens got really fast there at the end of the day,\" McIlroy said. \"You're grinding over three-footers and all of a sudden you get one that you think you can have a bit of a run at and if you hit it a little bit too hard ...\"\n\n\"I found the greens really, really difficult today,\" added McIlroy, whose difficulties were epitomized at the par-five 17th, where he was on the green in two but ultimately missed a four and a half-foot birdie putt.\n\nMcIlroy said he'd aim for a fast start on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm hitting the ball well. If I can keep driving it like that, putting the ball in the fairway, just giving myself chances and go from there -- that's all I can really do,\" said McIlroy, who was one stroke in front of South African Aldrich Potgieter.\n\nThe 21-year-old Potgieter, who claimed his lone PGA Tour title to date at the Rocket Classic in Detroit last year, had an eagle and six birdies in his six-under 65 and at 12-under was one clear of England's Aaron Rai, who shot a 66.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, who pushed his streak of PGA Tour cuts made to 68 without a stroke to spare after an erratic two days, climbed the leaderboard with a five-under 66 for five-under 208.\n\nScheffler, who said this week he has a \"weird\" relationship with Riviera, made four of his six birdies on the back nine, shaking off his lone bogey with the help of solid putting.\n\n\"At times it still felt weird,\" he said. \"The golf course is gettable in the morning, the greens are fresher. So I was able to hole a few putts, which is key.\"",

The main event is Sean Strickland vs. Anthony Hernandez in the Middleweight division, with Hernandez looking to ‘torture’ Strickland and pad his case for a title shot against Khamzat Chimaev. Strickland, who lost to Du Plessis in his last fight might jump to the front of the line if he has an impressive win over the streaking ‘Fluffly’.\n\nThe co-main event has Geoff Neal coming off a terrible loss to Carlos Prates. He’s meeting the KO machine Uros Medic (who has been sparked out once himself). That fight should produce a highlight reel moment or two.\n\nThe main card also has Dan ige vs. Melquizael Costa, Serghei Spivac vs. Ante Delija, Jacobe Smith vs. Josiah Harrell and Zachary Reese vs. Michel Pereira.\n\nThe UFC Houston “Prelims” are headlined by Chidi Njokuani vs. Carlos Leal.

Brahimaj did great in the first round, troubling Soriano with his speed and bodywork. But in the second Soriano’s strength advantage allowed him to spend a lot of the fight with Brahimaj pressed in the cage. In the pivotal third round Soriano came out hot and threw four head kicks in a row, with some sneaking through Brahimaj’s guard. Those hurt Brahimaj and took the wind out of him. He faded a lot down the stretch, due to those.

He got into a 0-2 hole against Lebosnoyani, who was aggressive on the feet and was able to get takedowns in the first round. In the third Rowe landed hard shots (single shots, though), but wasn’t able to summon up the barrage needed to score a late win.

Leavitt looked very big, and strong, at Featherweight and he proved that Del Valle is still a very raw prospect (he also literally spanked him in the third round). He won every round for me.\n\nOfficial decision: Jordan Leavitt def.

He also rushed for four scores. Across his last three seasons, Edmunds has over 8,600 passing yards and 107 total touchdowns.\n\nThe Buckeyes have held Edmunds’ pledge since Dec. 2, 2024. Well over a year later, he remains locked in with the Big Ten program.\n\n“I’ve never felt better,” Edmunds previously told Rivals. “I am committed to the best team in the land.”\n\nEdmunds is the No. 115 overall prospect and No. 10 QB in the 2027 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies.

    "description": "Man City 2-1 Newcastle: Pep Guardiola’s men closed the gap on Premier League leaders Arsenal to just two points with victory at the Etihad",
    "fullText": "When Manchester City won at Anfield, Pep Guardiola declared that all his side could do was breathe down the neck of Arsenal. And if the Premier League leaders are feeling ever more uncomfortable, it is because they can sense their pursuers are ever closer.\n\nThe margin is two points now, giving Arsenal all the more reason to rue the two they dropped at Molineux, all the more pressure in Sunday’s North London derby. City are acquiring the momentum Arsenal seem to have mislaid.\n\nAnd, after Arsenal capitulated at Wolves, City had a player who grasped the opportunity. They have spent around £430m in the last three transfer windows but their catalyst cost nothing. Three midfielders Guardiola has signed in the last 14 months began on the bench, in Nico Gonzalez, Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki, while the homegrown Nico O’Reilly started and delivered his first Premier League brace. Strange as it sounds, he is level for goals in 2026 with Erling Haaland. This was the sort of display that, if City become champions, may be bracketed with some of Yaya Toure’s goalscoring displays in past glories.\n\nThe life of O’Reilly may yet involve a trip to the World Cup. The life of Guardiola can involve reinventing and reimagining footballers. O’Reilly, a No 10 in his younger days, became a talismanic makeshift left-back. Now he has been recast as a marauding midfielder. “He played full-back, holding midfielder, he can play now in his position,” reflected Guardiola. “What a player. He makes an incredible step. Nico give us in the middle that physicality that we need.”\n\nMeanwhile, Haaland and Omar Marmoush, the split strikers and supposed scorers, became O’Reilly’s suppliers, each registering an assist. The Mancunian’s double showed different sides to his game; for the first, he arrowed in a shot from 18 yards after powering forward to meet Marmoush’s pass; the Egyptian may have been selected as a specialist for such a fixture, given his record of scoring against Newcastle, but instead helped make a goal.\n\nO’Reilly’s second felt the kind Haaland should be scoring. Instead, the Norwegian lofted the cross to the far post and the local lad met it with a towering header. “The assist from Erling was unbelievable,” added Guardiola. Haaland will almost certainly end the season with his third Premier League Golden Boot but now only Bruno Fernandes has more assists in the current campaign.\n\nAntoine Semenyo and Marmoush might have got a third for City while Nick Pope made a 91st-minute double save from Haaland and Phil Foden. None struck, which meant Gianluigi Donnarumma’s terrific 94th-minute stop was needed to deny Harvey Barnes and secure the points.\n\nYet, amid the tension, there was a predictability to the outcome. City’s fifth straight win in all competitions was a third over Newcastle in 2026. There may be a fourth when they meet in the FA Cup in two weeks. As Newcastle’s last point at the Etihad came in 2006, an extraordinarily unsuccessful run was extended. Nevertheless, they threatened to end it.\n\nAt least a 17th straight reverse brought a first top-flight goal here since 2018 and in Eddie Howe’s reign. Lewis Hall squeezed a shot through a crowded box, aided by a deflection off Rodri. It was a landmark goal for the left-back, too; his first in 21 months.\n\nWhen Newcastle pulled level, City restored their lead inside five minutes. That was an immediate riposte and City’s swift start had suggested they were intent on making a point. They played at a blistering pace. Newcastle struggled in the first half and rallied thereafter. “You have to take into account the game in midweek and the travel,” said Howe, who fielded 10 of the side who started against Qarabag in Azerbaijan three days earlier. “It was a good effort by the lads physically.”\n\nHowe rued the defensive errors for the two goals. Newcastle might have scored two of their own. Dan Burn headed in Sandro Tonali’s free kick and had begun celebrating before he was flagged. It seemed he was pushed into an offside position by Ruben Dias, though Howe did not complain.\n\nNewcastle had another threat, even when under the cosh: Anthony Gordon’s pace on the break rendered him a menace. He drew a fine save from Donnarumma after motoring past Marc Guehi. When he was accelerating beyond Dias, the defender tugged him back, at a cost of a caution. He went off at half-time, the faster Abdukodir Khusanov replacing him. Gordon was less of a threat thereafter. Guardiola’s change worked.\n\nSo City left the field to cheers. They entered it to a guard of honour from their 1976 League Cup winners, who beat Newcastle in the final and secured the club’s last major trophy for 35 years. It felt as if it should have been the other way around, the current players forming the guard for their predecessors.\n\nThis new-look City side have not won much together. “Seventy per cent of the players have never been in that situation,” noted Guardiola. But perhaps they appear better equipped to cope with it than Arsenal.",

    "description": "While in New Delhi on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said \"there will come a time\" for orbital data centers, but it won't be anytime soon.",
    "fullText": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman famously don't agree on much.\n\nThe latest point of contention: data centers in space. Musk has made it a priority. Altman thinks it's a fantasy, at least for now.\n\n\"I honestly think the idea with the current landscape of putting data centers in space is ridiculous,\" Altman said during a live interview with local media in New Delhi on Friday, causing audience members to laugh.\n\nAltman said that orbital data centers could \"make sense someday,\" but factors like launch costs and the difficulty of repairing a computer chip in space remain overwhelming obstacles.\n\n\"We are not there yet,\" Altman added. \"There will come a time. Space is great for a lot of things. Orbital data centers are not something that's going to matter at scale this decade.\"\n\nMusk would almost certainly disagree.\n\nWhile many Big Tech and AI companies are spending billions on data center construction on Earth, Musk's eyes are on the stars, per usual. Orbital data centers are his latest ambition, as he mentioned in an all-hands xAI meeting in December.\n\nIn February, SpaceX said its goal is to launch a \"constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers.\" The company has already begun hiring engineers to make that happen.\n\nDuring an all-hands meeting with xAI employees this month, Musk said SpaceX's acquisition of xAI will allow them to deploy the orbital data centers faster.\n\nDespite Altman's skepticism, other tech leaders are also racing to place data centers in space. Google's Project Suncatcher, unveiled in November 2025, aims to do just that. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told Fox News Sunday the company could start placing data centers — powered by the sun — in space as early as 2027.\n\nTech and AI companies rely on data centers to power their products, like large language models and chatbots. Those data centers, however, can deplete water resources, strain power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the overall quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024, nearly four times the number from 2010.\n\nNow, proposed data center campuses in Texas, Oklahoma, and elsewhere are increasingly facing stiff resistance from local communities.",

    "fullText": "Like a modern-day Paul Revere, Ben Dziobek's voice rang across the night as he ran toward a crowd waiting outside New Brunswick City Hall on Wednesday.\n\nThe news? Members of the city council struck down potential plans to build a data center.\n\n\"They canceled it! They canceled it!\" Dziobek shouts in footage shared by New Jersey's Climate Revolution Action Network. Loud cheers followed, and then a chant: \"The people, united, will never be defeated!\"\n\nThe New Brunswick City Council had just decided to remove data centers from the list of permitted uses in a plan to redevelop several parcels of land. While no data center had yet been proposed, even the possibility that a data center could someday end up there raised alarm among city residents.\n\n\"The city administration is asking the council to amend the redevelopment plan to remove data centers as a permitted use, and to reinsert the requirement for inclusion of a park on the site that's provided in the prior redevelopment,\" New Brunswick's city planner Daniel Dominguez said at the meeting.\n\nLarge, warehouse-style data centers have become a flash point for many communities across America as Big Tech and other AI companies look to power the large language models and chatbots they say are going to change the world. Those data centers, however, can be a drain on water resources and power grids, increase pollution, and decrease the quality of life.\n\nAn investigation by Business Insider published last year found that over 1,200 data centers had been approved for construction across the US by the end of 2024. These data centers, the report found, could consume as much power as entire US states and guzzle enormous amounts of water daily in drought-stricken regions.\n\nIn New Brunswick, those environmental concerns were top of mind.\n\n\"Community members cited concerns over environmental impact, energy consumption, water usage, noise pollution, and the broader implications of allowing large‐scale artificial intelligence and data infrastructure to expand into residential and public community spaces,\" the Climate Revolution Action Network, a local environmental activist group that helped organize opposition to the redevelopment plan, said in a press release.\n\nOn Wednesday, residents and environmental advocates attended a New Brunswick City Council meeting to discuss the proposal.\n\nDuring the meeting, Dominguez said the inclusion of a potential data center in the redevelopment plan was intended to \"diversify the commercial development site,\" but that it was \"not critical to the project.\"\n\nAttendees cheered after the city council ultimately voted to nix the data center.\n\n\"I'd like to thank the council for deciding to scrap what many people did not want in their neighborhoods,\" one attendee said. \"We don't want these kinds of centers in here that are going to take resources from the community.\"\n\nNew Brunswick is one among many communities across the country fighting potential data center developments.\n\nA large group of residents opposing a proposed data center in Clarmore, Oklahoma, turned out for a council meeting to discuss the project last week. Police arrested one of them for speaking for 30 seconds over their allotted three minutes. In San Marcos, Texas, hundreds of residents showed up at City Hall on Tuesday to protest a data center. The city council eventually scrapped that plan after a nearly 9-hour debate, according to local reports.",

    "fullText": "A gurn or chuck[citation needed] is a distorted facial expression and a verb to describe the action. A typical gurn involves projecting the lower jaw as far forward and up as possible and covering the upper lip with the lower lip.[1]\n\nThe English Dialect Dictionary, compiled by Joseph Wright, defines the word gurn as \"to snarl as a dog; to look savage; to distort the countenance,\" while the Oxford English Dictionary suggests the derivation may originally be Scottish, related to grin. In Northern Ireland, the verb to gurn means \"to cry\", and crying is often referred to as \"gurnin'\". Originally the Scottish dialectical usage refers to a person who is complaining. The term gurn may also refer to an involuntary facial muscular contortion experienced as a side-effect of MDMA consumption.[2]\n\nGurning contests are a rural English tradition. They are held regularly in some villages, with contestants traditionally framing their faces through a horse collar—known as \"gurnin' through a braffin\".[3]\n\nThe World Gurning Championship takes place annually at the Egremont Crab Fair.[4] The fair dates back to 1267, when King Henry III granted it a Royal Charter.[5] The origins of the gurning competition itself are unclear, and it may not be so old, although it was described as an ancient tradition by local newspaper The Cumberland Paquet in 1852.[6]\n\nThe most successful gurners are often those with no teeth. This provides greater room to move the jaw further up. In some cases, the elderly or otherwise toothless can perform gurns where their lower lip covers the nostrils. A notable example of this was performed by Jovante Carter, a 22-year-old American man from New Orleans. He held the gurn for 1 minute and 2 seconds, earning a Guinness World Record.[7][8]\n\nPeter Jackman became England's best-known gurner, winning the world championship four times, beginning in 1998 with a face called the \"Bela Lugosi\". He made numerous TV appearances, including an appearance on They Think It's All Over.[9] He had his teeth removed in 2000 to make his features easier to manoeuvre.[10]\n\nThe only male gurner to win the world title 15 times is Tommy Mattinson (UK), who took the top prize at the World Gurning Championship in 1986–87 and then 10 times between 1999 and 2010.[11]\n\nAnne Woods won the women's world title 28 times.[12]",

    "fullText": "Seven years after firing them into the Premier League, Tammy Abraham is back scoring goals at Aston Villa to keep their fans and manager dreaming of glory.\n\nWith Villa on the verge of losing 1-0 to Leeds United on Saturday, substitute Abraham, who had only been on the pitch for 13 minutes, guided the ball with his knee into the net to score an 88th-minute equaliser.\n\nIt was the 28-year-old's second goal since returning to the club following his £18.2m move from Besiktas in January, after scoring in the 3-1 loss to Newcastle in the FA Cup seven days ago.\n\nBut scoring for Villa is nothing new for the 11-time England international. He netted 25 times in 37 Championship games to help the club win promotion in 2018-19 during a loan spell from Chelsea.\n\nAfter his original time with Villa, Abraham had two seasons at Chelsea, three at Roma, one on loan at AC Milan and then another loan spell at Besiktas, with the Turkish club buying him to then immediately sell him to Villa for a profit.\n\n\"It feels like a dream to come back and play for this club again,\" said Abraham. \"I'm happy to be here and bring extra energy.\n\n\"I had to sniff around the box, be alert, be ready. Luckily for us, I got the goal - it was in front of some of the best supporters in the world.\"\n\nAbraham equaliser earns draw for Villa against Leeds\n\nDespite the late equaliser, third-placed Villa have now dropped seven points from their past four matches and sit seven points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 11 games to go.\n\nAsked whether the Villa squad feel like they are title contenders, Abraham said: \"Who knows what can happen? We are not too far from Arsenal who are at the top. Unfortunately today we didn't get the win but we just have to keep pushing.\n\n\"When I first arrived I spoke with a few of the boys, and watching from afar you can see that the team has a lot of qualities. We're delighted to be where we are today but we are so close, so we have to just keep pushing and keep believing in ourselves.\n\n\"I'm happy to be back home. I just need to find myself a house!\"\n\nEven though Arsenal have drawn back-to-back games, it is hard to see them or second-placed Manchester City dropping enough points for Villa to take advantage and become English champions for the first time since 1981.\n\nBoss Unai Emery has consistently talked down his side's chances of winning the league, last month saying even a top-five position could be beyond them.\n\nHe was quick to remind the supporters, some of whom booed the team off at half-time when they were trailing 1-0 on Saturday, that they were still enjoying a fantastic campaign.\n\n\"We are at a beautiful and fantastic moment to compete in two competitions for the remainder of the season,\" he said. \"It is the moment to show our wishes and follow our dreams.\n\n\"We have a great opportunity to achieve our objectives and dream of big things. Our position in the table is enviable and we all would have signed up for it before the season began.\n\n\"The Premier League is very difficult for us, but we are third - and that's very good. Our priority is to focus on every match. We're third with 51 points and the next step is Wolves [on Friday].\n\n\"We're setting our standards high and sometimes you can get frustrated, but overall our consistency is still there and we're third because of that consistency.\"\n\nAbraham, who received a great reception from the club's fans when he came on, played alongside Ollie Watkins, instead of replacing him.\n\nEmery said that was a tactic he would do again in the right circumstances, with Abraham also relishing the competition for a place.\n\n\"We spoke about it [playing together] a few times in training, and luckily we were able to grab the goal so the gaffer can see that it can work,\" added Abraham.\n\n\"We know he is a top striker and he has been here for a few years and scored many goals, so it is fantastic competition to have.\"\n\nEmery was full of praise for the new recruit and added: \"He left the Premier League seven years ago and now he is adapting in everything we're demanding.\n\n\"It's a huge commitment from him to try to help us with his qualities, and he showed it because he played 20 minutes and he was motivated, excited and scored from it.\"\n\nLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Aston Villa - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Despite having just 3 billion parameters, Ferret-UI Lite matches or surpasses the benchmark performance of models up to 24 times larger.",
    "fullText": "Despite having just 3 billion parameters, Ferret-UI Lite matches or surpasses the benchmark performance of models up to 24 times larger. Here are the details.\n\nIn December 2023, a team of 9 researchers published a study called “FERRET: Refer and Ground Anything Anywhere at Any Granularity”. In it, they presented a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that was capable of understanding natural language references to specific parts of an image:\n\nSince then, Apple has published a series of follow-up papers expanding the Ferret family of models, including Ferretv2, Ferret-UI, and Ferret-UI 2.\n\nSpecifically, Ferret-UI variants expanded on the original capabilities of FERRET, and were trained to overcome what the researchers defined as a shortcoming of general-domain MLLMs.\n\nFrom the original Ferret-UI paper:\n\nRecent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate “any resolution” on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features.\n\nA few days ago, Apple expanded the Ferret-UI family of models even further, with a study called Ferret-UI Lite: Lessons from Building Small On-Device GUI Agents.\n\nFerret-UI was built on a 13B-parameter model, which focused primarily on mobile UI understanding and fixed-resolution screenshots. Meanwhile, Ferret-UI 2 expanded the system to support multiple platforms and higher-resolution perception.\n\nAccording to the researchers of the new paper, “the majority of existing methods of GUI agents […] focus on large foundation models.” That is because “the strong reasoning and planning capabilities of large server-side models allow these agentic systems to achieve impressive capabilities in diverse GUI navigation tasks.”\n\nThey note that while there has been a lot of progress on both multi-agent, and end-to-end GUI systems, that take different approaches to streamline the many tasks that involve agentic interaction with GUIs (“low-level GUI grounding, screen understanding, multi-step planning, and self-reflection”), they are basically too large and compute-hungry to run well on-device.\n\nSo, they set out to develop Ferret-UI Lite, a 3-billion parameter variant of Ferret-UI, which “is built with several key components, guided by insights on training small-scale” language models.\n\nThe result is a model that closely matches or even outperforms competing GUI agent models that are up to 24 times its parameter count.\n\nWhile the entire architecture (which is thoroughly detailed in the study) is interesting, the real-time cropping and zooming-in techniques are particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe model makes an initial prediction, crops around it, then re-predicts on that cropped region. This helps such a small model compensate for its limited capacity to process large numbers of image tokens.\n\nAnother notable contribution of the paper is how Ferret-UI Lite basically generates its own training data. The researchers built a multi-agent system that interacts directly with live GUI platforms to produce synthetic training examples at scale.\n\nThere is a curriculum task generator that proposes goals of increasing difficulty, a planning agent breaks them into steps, a grounding agent executes them on-screen, and a critic model evaluates the results.\n\nWith this pipeline, the training system captures the fuzziness of real-world interaction (such as errors, unexpected states, and recovery strategies), which is something that would be much more challenging to do while relying on clean, human-annotated data.\n\nInterestingly, while Ferret-UI and Ferret-UI 2 used iPhone screenshots and other Apple interfaces in their evaluations, Ferret-UI Lite was trained and evaluated on Android, web, and desktop GUI environments, using benchmarks like AndroidWorld and OSWorld.\n\nThe researchers don’t note explicitly why they chose this route for Ferret-UI Lite, but it likely reflects where reproducible, large-scale GUI-agent testbeds are available today.\n\nBe it as it may, the researchers found that while Ferret-UI Lite performed well on short-horizon, low-level tasks, it did not perform as strongly on more complicated, multi-step interactions, a trade-off that would be largely expected, given the constraints of a small, on-device model.\n\nOn the other hand, Ferret-UI Lite offers a local, and by extension, private (since no data needs to go to the cloud and be processed on remote servers) agent that autonomously interacts with app interfaces based on user requests, which, by all accounts, is pretty cool.\n\nTo learn more about the study, including benchmark breakdowns and results, follow this link.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "description": "A Blog post by FINAL_Bench on Hugging Face",
    "fullText": "Authors: Taebong Kim, Minsik Kim, Sunyoung Choi, Jaewon Jang\nDataset: FINAL-Bench/Metacognitive | 100 Tasks | 15 Domains | Apache 2.0\n\nMMLU has crossed 90%. GPQA is saturating. HumanEval has hit its ceiling. Yet every single one of these benchmarks shares a common blind spot: none of them has ever measured whether AI can recognize its own errors and correct them.\n\nCognitive psychology calls this ability metacognition. It is the real dividing line between human experts and novices, and a prerequisite for AGI. When a physician catches a misdiagnosis and changes the treatment plan, when a scientist revises a hypothesis after unexpected results — the essence of these actions is metacognition.\n\nFINAL Bench (Frontier Intelligence Nexus for AGI-Level Verification) is the first benchmark to systematically measure this capability.\n\nWhere existing benchmarks ask \"Did you get the right answer?\", FINAL Bench asks \"What did you do when you got it wrong?\"\n\nFirst, we separate \"saying\" from \"fixing.\" Among our 5-axis rubric, MA (Metacognitive Accuracy) measures the declarative ability to say \"I might be wrong,\" while ER (Error Recovery) measures the procedural ability to actually detect and correct errors. This separation directly maps to the monitoring-control model of Nelson & Narens (1990) in cognitive psychology and is a first in AI benchmarking.\n\nSecond, every task embeds a hidden cognitive trap. Confirmation bias, anchoring, base-rate neglect — cognitive biases established in psychology are deliberately planted across all 100 tasks. We observe the model's process of \"falling into and climbing out of\" these traps. Tasks span 15 domains (mathematics, medicine, ethics, philosophy, economics, and more), 8 TICOS metacognitive types, and 3 difficulty grades.\n\nThird, we isolate causal effects through two conditions. Baseline is a single API call with no self-correction prompting. MetaCog applies a three-phase self-correction scaffold (initial reasoning, critical self-review, corrective revision). This follows the same logic as placebo-controlled clinical trials.\n\nScoring uses a tri-model LLM-as-Judge ensemble (GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro). Cross-validation with human annotators on a 20-task subset confirmed Cohen's kappa = 0.87.\n\nWe evaluated 9 SOTA models across 100 expert-level tasks: GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek-V3.2, Kimi K2.5, and four others.\n\nThe MetaCog scaffold produces a mean gain of +14.05 points. 94.8% of this gain comes from Error Recovery alone.\n\nThe remaining four axes contribute a combined 5.2%. The bottleneck to AGI-level performance is not knowledge, not reasoning — it is self-correction alone.\n\nAll 9 models, without exception, satisfy MA > ER at Baseline.\n\nBaseline mean: MA = 0.694 vs. ER = 0.302 (Gap = 0.392)\n\nThe ability to verbalize uncertainty is substantial; the ability to actually correct errors is less than half. When the MetaCog scaffold is applied, ER jumps by +0.533 while MA moves only +0.035 under the same conditions. A 15x differential. The two capabilities are independent.\n\nThis is the first large-scale quantitative evidence of the declarative-procedural dissociation in AI — a 40-year-old open question in cognitive psychology. The phenomenon mirrors a well-documented clinical pattern: physicians who say \"this diagnosis is uncertain\" yet do not change the treatment plan. Today, all 9 of the world's leading AI models exhibit this exact behavior.\n\nBaseline score and MetaCog gain are strongly anticor\n\nClaude Opus 4.6, which recorded the lowest Baseline, showed the largest gain (Delta = +20.13). Kimi K2.5, with the highest Baseline, showed the smallest gain (Delta = +9.83). Models with higher intrinsic self-correction benefit less from external scaffolding.\n\nNotable: Claude Opus 4.6 rises from Baseline rank 9 to MetaCog rank 5 — the highest scaffold receptivity of any model. Kimi K2.5 maintains rank 1 in both conditions but shows the smallest gain, consistent with its already-elevated intrinsic ER (0.450).\n\nModels with high MA and low ER represent the most dangerous safety profile. They sound humble — \"I'm not entirely confident about this\" — while failing to self-correct. Users perceive reliability where none exists.\n\nAll 9 SOTA models currently match this profile. The MA-ER Gap is the first metric to quantitatively identify this risk.\n\nComposition: 100 tasks / 15 domains / 8 TICOS types / 3 grades / 12 fields per task\n\nFINAL Bench: Measuring Functional Metacognitive Reasoning in Large Language Models\nTaebong Kim, Minsik Kim, Sunyoung Choi, Jaewon Jang\nCurrently under review at a leading international AI venue.\n\nFuture directions include L2 layer measurement via open-source model logit entropy analysis, expanded multi-judge and human cross-validation, and periodic task pool refresh to prevent contamination.\n\nAGI without metacognition is driving with your eyes closed.\nFINAL Bench is the first tool to tell apart what AI truly knows from what it merely pretends to know.\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/FINAL-Bench/Metacognitive\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/FINAL-Bench/Leaderboard\n\n·\n Sign up or\n log in to comment",

Zamora - fighting at world level for the first time - pressed forward and targeted the body.\n\nRyan responded with a sharp left hook in the second but was forced onto the back foot as Zamora kept the pressure on.\n\nAlthough Ryan was landing with the cleaner counters, Zamora was more effective with her inside work. By halfway, it was tighter than expected.\n\nBruised around the eyes, Ryan traded in the seventh as blood streamed from Zamora's nose, the visitor edging the exchanges.\n\nRyan boxed behind the jab in the ninth before they ended toe-to-toe, swinging at close range.\n\nAt the final bell, a case could be made for either fighter, or a draw.\n\nThe win, gritty rather than pretty, puts Ryan back in contention.\n\nUndisputed champion Katie Taylor holds the division's other belts but has yet to confirm her next move. At welterweight, unified champion Lauren Price may loom as a future target.\n\nA crossover bout with former MMA champion Cris Cyborg - now 5-0 in professional boxing - has also been previously mooted.\n\nEarlier in the night, Bilal Fawaz became British and Commonwealth light-middleweight champion by dethroning Ishmael Davis in a close contest.\n\nDavis, 30, started well and landed the more crisp and cleaner punches with Fawaz guilty of too much showboating and theatrics.\n\nBut Fawaz, 37, upped his punch output and took advantage in the second half as Davis tired.\n\nThe judges scored it 114-114, 115-113 and 115-114.\n\nNigerian-born Fawaz adds the British and Commonwealth titles to his collection, though he continues the fight for a British passport and is currently not able to fight or travel abroad.\n\nFawaz, who was trafficked to the UK as a teenager and after escaping a traumatic beginning to life, is now married and a father of two children, as well as working as an Uber driver.\n\n\"I know I'm 37 years old and I don't have much time. If I don't capitalise on what I have now, my dream will slip away. This is just the beginning, I am ready. I want it all,\" he said.\n\n\"It's sensational. It's overwhelming.\"\n\n\"I'm not a domestic fighter,\" he said. \"It's just that nobody gave me a chance. Eddie [Hearn] gave me a chance and I've proved him right ever since.\n\n\"Now I need to make some money and feed my family.\"\n\nWithout a passport, Fawaz cannot travel abroad to accept any world title opportunities outside of the UK.\n\n\"Get this man a passport,\" promoter Eddie Hearn added.\n\nAlso on the undercard in Nottingham, Molly McCann claimed her third professional win by outpointing Beata Dudek, while teenagers Leo Atang and Tiah Mai Ayton continued their unbeaten runs.\n\nHeavyweight Atang, 19, stopped Dan Garber inside a minute to make it five from five, and Ayton, also 19, went the distance for the first time in her fifth bout, defeating Catherine Tacone Ramos on points.\n\nPopular heavyweight Dave Allen returned to winning ways with a first-round stoppage of Karim Berredjem.

    "fullText": "Tries: Walters, Eckersley, Eseh, Field 2, French Goals: Keighran 5\n\nWigan Warriors cruised past Hull FC to claim a second successive win at the start of the 2026 Super League season in a dominant display at the Brick Community Stadium.\n\nThe home side raced into a 24-point lead at the break, scoring four unanswered tries, as their bid to regain the Super League title from Hull KR continues to take shape.\n\nSam Walters, Zach Eckersley, Sam Eseh and Jai Field all crossed to effectively put the result beyond doubt before half-time.\n\nHull failed to back up their victory over new boys Bradford Bulls in a disappointing performance as tries from Bevan French, and a second from Field, after the break added further gloss to Warriors' win before Hull grabbed a late consolation through Harvie Hill.\n\nIt did not take long for Warriors to assert their dominance when a high kick to the right corner was well competed for by Eckersley and Walters was in the right place at the right time to collect and dive over from close range in the fifth minute.\n\nEckersley then turned from provider to scorer when he got in at the right corner following a flowing Warriors move as Hull struggled to cope with the hosts' blistering start.\n\nFull-back Field then thought he had got in on the act - breaking through a loose Hull tackle - to dart over before the quarter-hour mark but Hull received a reprieve when video referee Aaron Moore disallowed the try as Liam Farrell was pulled up for an obstruction on Will Pryce.\n\nThe visitors then became the architects of their own downfall when Harvey Barron dropped the ball in front of his own posts, allowing ex-Hull loanee Eseh to pounce and dive over from close in.\n\nA beautiful sidestep from Field created a huge gap in the Black and Whites' back field before crawling over for Wigan's fourth try.\n\nWithin four minutes of the restart, French squirmed through a limp challenge on the right edge to dive over in clinical and trademark fashion and Adam Keighran comfortably slotted the extras.\n\nMatt Peet's side did not take their foot off the gas despite their huge advantage and Liam Marshall looked to find captain Farrell - who would have had a walk-in - but the ball was well intercepted by Arthur Romano.\n\nHull's Liam Knight was sent to the bin with 10 minutes remaining for a dangerous challenge and Warriors grabbed their sixth try of the night immediately after when Keighran juggled the ball to Field, who dived over for his second.\n\nThe match became 12-a-side soon after when Keighran received a yellow card for a late shot on Pryce and ex-Wigan prop Hill grabbed his first try for his new club to put a blot on Warriors' clean sheet.\n\nThe match ended on a sour note when Pryce suffered what looked like a serious knee injury as he was helped off the field.\n\nWigan coach Matt Peet told Sky Sports:\n\n\"Pleased with the result and aspects of the performance. [We] could certainly have been better, and we will be, but I certainly would have taken that on the way here.\n\n\"We did some good things. It's important not to get carried away but there were some good signs, both sides of the ball, particularly in the first half.\n\n\"I thought we could have finished the game a bit better, just a little bit more discipline and regarding turnovers. Those are the only things I'm looking at tomorrow morning.\"\n\nHull FC coach John Cartwright told BBC Radio Humberside:\n\n\"We were up against it from the word go. They were very good and we weren't so good.\n\n\"Right from the kick-off I think they rolled down the field too easy. I take responsibility for that as much as the players. For whatever reason, we just weren't up to it.\"\n\nOn Liam Knight's yellow card: \"It was just plain dumb, stupid. I'll address that with Liam. On the dumb scale, it's probably a 10 [out of 10].\"\n\nOn Will Pryce's injury: \"[The] Doctor's had a look at him. It's more hopeful at the moment that it's not serious but it's way too early. We'll get some scans going and we'll see from there.\"\n\nWigan: Field; Eckersley, Keighran, Farrell, Marshall; French, Smith; Havard, O'Neill, Thompson, Nsemba, Walters, Ellis.\n\nInterchanges: Mago, Partington, Eseh, Forber.\n\nHull FC: Pryce; Barron, Romano, Litten, Martin; Cust, Sezer; Knight, Bourouh, Hill, Batchelor, Cartwright, Aydin.\n\nInterchanges: Lisone, Bailey, Fash, Kemp.",

    "fullText": "Scotland captain Sione Tuipulotu hailed his side's \"ugly\" Six Nations victory in Cardiff as they earned a fourth straight win over Wales for the first time in 99 years.\n\nOff the back of last weekend's superb triumph over England at Murrayfield, all the talk was whether Gregor Townsend's side could back up that performance in a game in which they arrived as heavy favourites.\n\nThey went into half-time 17-5 down though as Wales - now winless in 14 Six Nations matches - dominated the breakdown and the collisions, roared on by their home support.\n\nSecond-half tries from Finn Russell, Darcy Graham and George Turner earned the Scots a nail-biting 23-26 win - one that keeps their title hopes alive and the wolves from Townsend's door.\n\n\"We dug deep,\" Tuipulotu said. \"We did what we needed to do to win ugly.\"\n\nPlayer of the match Rory Darge backed up his captain's sentiment.\n\n\"It's hard to get wins on the road and that was a gritty one,\" he said.\n\n\"It's hard to wrestle back 17-5 down and we did that. Massively proud of everyone.\"\n\n'Scotland's terrible beauty reverses the narrative on extraordinary day'\n\nScotland battle back for Six Nations win over Wales\n\nThere was little Scottish grit in the opening stages as Wales raced out of the blocks and established a healthy lead thanks to Sam Costelow's boot and tries from Rhys Carre and Josh Adams.\n\nTownsend turned to his bench early to try to arrest Welsh momentum, with Pierre Schoeman and Josh Bayliss introduced before half-time.\n\nBayliss was superb and fellow replacements George Horne and Graham brought energy after the break as Scotland built momentum following a sloppy start to the second half.\n\nAfter one of many Scotland line-outs went astray and the usually reliable Kyle Steyn knocked on, the visitors went through 27 phases before Russell darted over.\n\nIt was a spell of composure and cutting edge that Scotland desperately needed - qualities they have lacked when needed in recent times.\n\n\"It's something we've worked a lot on in this campaign - having composure and being calm in the 22,\" fly-half Finn Russell said. \"Now it's only going to the backs when it's on.\"\n\nThe winning try was another example of that new-found calm. A successfully executed line-out, a perfectly set up maul and Turner driving over.\n\n\"They still didn't play particularly well,\" former Scotland prop Peter Wright said. \"But they showed grit, determination and composure.\n\n\"Did we deserve it? In the end, just. We showed bottle and that's what you want.\"\n\nAfter the opening defeat by Italy and a disappointing autumn campaign, questions have been asked of Townsend and whether he has taken this team as far as he can after nine years at the helm.\n\nHowever, another Calcutta Cup triumph strengthened his case and his team showed a different side to their game in the Welsh capital.\n\n\"In some ways, this is more important or more impressive than last week when they were in control,\" former Scotland full-back Chris Paterson said.\n\n\"Gregor Townsend was asked difficult questions and made brilliant coaching decisions to introduce players quickly.\n\n\"It's an excellent win on the road for Scotland.\"\n\nFor all the post-match talk of Scotland's grit, bottle and composure, the turning point was a combination of opportunism and a lapse in Welsh concentration.\n\nAfter Jarrod Evans slotted a penalty for the hosts to extend their lead, Russell took the restart quickly into space and Graham raced on to it to score.\n\nWales wing Gabriel Hamer-Webb allowed Graham to run beyond him, not realising that team-mate James Botham had turned his back on the ball and allowed it to bounce.\n\n\"Credit to Scotland for being brave,\" former captain John Barclay said. \"The game swung on the Darcy Graham try.\"\n\nWales head coach Steve Tandy - formerly Scotland defence coach - raised his arms in dismay in the stands, powerless to stop such a preventable try.\n\n\"A lucky bounce I'd say and they weren't expecting it,\" said Russell, when asked for his perspective.\n\n\"That will be a frustrating one for Steve Tandy - he knows that's something I look for and Darcy scoring is a coach killer.\"\n\nTownsend praised the awareness of his fly-half and acknowledged the impact it had on the rest of the contest.\n\n\"That was a big moment in the game,\" he said. \"Credit goes to Finn for seeing that space and Darcy being alive to it.\"\n\nAfter their hugely disappointing loss in Rome, Scotland's championship chances were all but written off.\n\nYet, England's drubbing by Ireland means the Scots lead the standings on 11 points before unbeaten France host the Italians on Sunday.\n\nScotland welcome France to Edinburgh in two weeks' time knowing a third straight win would set up a date with destiny in Dublin.\n\nThat is still a long way away and France have looked imperious to date, but Scotland are in with a shot.\n\n\"We're still in the championship,\" Townsend said. \"That's all that counts.\n\n\"Today showed - not just our game - that anything can happen in the championship.\n\n\"We'll be underdogs against France and we know we'll have to play our best rugby.\"",

    "fullText": "The speed skating events at the 2030 Winter Olympics will take place outside host nation France, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe Games, known as French Alps 2030, will be mostly spread across south-east France with venue clusters in Nice, Briancon, Savoie and Haut-Savoie.\n\nHowever, the speed skating will take place in pre-existing venues in either Turin in northern Italy, or Heerenveen in the Netherlands.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Games organisers do not want to build new venues that would not have a definite legacy in the host region.\n\nEdgar Grospiron, president of the French Alps 2030 organising committee, said holding the speed skating outside France was a condition agreed with the IOC upon becoming hosts of the Games.\n\n\"This decision has already been taken, so the organising committee has to go on what has already been decided,\" he told a media conference in Milan on Saturday, the day before the 2026 hosts hand over responsibility for the Games.\n\n\"This is so that the Games in the French Alps can be as we want them to be.\n\n\"For the first time we will have a Games with a discipline in another European country. This will be new; we will see if other Games do it.\"\n\nHolding events away from the host city or region is not unprecedented in the Olympics. At Paris 2024, the surfing events were held on the Pacific island of Tahiti - approximately 10,000 miles away from France.\n\nBut Tahiti, an island in French Polynesia, is an overseas territory of France, while the 2030 speed skating will be held in a different independent nation.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nGrospiron said about 15% of sports and venues for 2030 have not yet been decided, but that details will be confirmed by June this year.\n\nHe said figure skating - which does not currently have a confirmed location - will take place in Nice, as will curling and ice hockey.\n\nGrospiron also said they will decide on which new sports, if any, will be added to the programme and if any events will be removed.\n\nThe future of Nordic combined - the only event at Milan-Cortina 2026 not to have a women's competition - has not yet been confirmed.\n\nSki mountaineering, which made its debut in 2026, is yet to be confirmed as a medal event in the French Alps.\n\n\"New sports are at the eart of our concerns, this will need to be broached to then decide what our venue plan is like and has to be validated by June by the IOC,\" Grospiron said.\n\n\"We will not do this alone; we will do this hand in hand with federations and venues.\n\n\"For Nordic combined, this is at the helm of the IOC. We will follow the recommendations of the IOC. We are there to listen, to help us finalise our venue plan.\"\n\nThere have been reports of infighting, external among the 2030 organising committee, with director general Cyril Linette allegedly departing amid differences with Grospiron, as well as budget cuts.\n\nGrospiron said they have \"little time, little money\" but were confident the Games would be delivered successfully.\n\n\"We talk every day about wanting to make these Games a success,\" he said. \"The organising committee needs serenity, continuity, then we will show what our teams can do. We are very proud of the work we have been able to do.\n\n\"We know we have very little time, little money.

    "description": "Ireland issue a defiant response to talk they are a fading force, with a record-breaking Six Nations win over England at Allianz Stadium.",
    "fullText": "There was a moment, deep into England's nightmare at Allianz Stadium, that summed up the ferocity and intensity that fuelled one of the great Ireland performances.\n\nWith a famous Six Nations scalp on English soil already in the bag, Ireland surrendered possession with a rare mistake. Marcus Smith intercepted Jack Crowley's attempted pass and off he went.\n\nEngland were 42-14 down, but Stuart McCloskey still wasn't prepared to let Smith out of his sight. Even with a mountain of work already behind him, the seemingly indefatigable Ulster centre hared after the England replacement, chased him down and barrelled him into touch.\n\nIt prompted one of the loudest Irish cheers on an afternoon soundtracked by them and was highlighted by head coach Andy Farrell in his post-match remarks as evidence of the unrelenting appetite that drove Ireland to a record 42-21 win in the home of English rugby.\n\n\"Honestly, I said it to the lads, I didn't care whether we won or lost today, just whether we grew as a group, because we know where we want to go to and it just so happens that to the people of Ireland winning does matter and it brings a bit of joy on everyone's face,\" said Farrell.\n\n\"For them, I mean the crowd, the people that turned up, it was immense. I hope everyone at home is just as proud as well.\"\n\nWhat went wrong for England in nightmare defeat?\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\n'Special day' - Farrell revels in record Irish win\n\nAfter being mercilessly pummelled by France a fortnight ago, Ireland arrived in south-west London and showed the rugby world they're not quite done yet.\n\nOn Thursday, Farrell urged his players to \"fire a few shots\", and they responded to end England's nine-match winning run at home in ruthless fashion and ruin Maro Itoje's 100th cap.\n\nHeavily criticised for their passive, leggy display in Paris, Ireland rediscovered the defensive grit and attacking flair that propelled them to the top of the world rankings leading into the 2023 World Cup.\n\nThere were monumental performances all over the field.\n\nCaelan Doris produced one of his best displays as captain, Crowley impressed at fly-half, Rob Baloucoune delivered crucial moments at both ends of the field, and Josh van der Flier responded emphatically to being dropped for last week's win over Italy.\n\nBut no Irish player stood taller than Jamison Gibson-Park, who epitomised Ireland's desire to best England on both sides of the ball with a virtuoso display at scrum-half.\n\nThe British and Irish Lion, who said he sought feedback from the coaches after being benched against Italy, scored Ireland's first try, created the second for Baloucoune, and ended his day with a much-deserved player of the match award.\n\n\"I called it after a few of his first moments that he'd get man of the match,\" legendary Irish scrum-half Conor Murray said on the Ireland Rugby Social.\n\n\"He kept things quick, did what he does best. Tadhg Beirne was unbelievably sharp to give him the ball for that try and everything flowed after that. He was brilliant.\"\n\nOver the past 12 months, Ireland have struggled to carry the weight of expectation.\n\nDemolished at home by France in last year's Six Nations, double-digit losses to New Zealand and South Africa in November strengthened the argument that Farrell's side were being ushered away from rugby's top table.\n\nAnd while they cannot definitively settle that debate until the World Cup, Saturday's win should act as an important checkpoint on their journey to next year's tournament in Australia.\n\n\"In the camp in the lead-up to this, I know they were offended by the criticism and everyone saying this team's done,\" added Murray, who won 125 Ireland caps in a career that yielded five Six Nations titles.\n\n\"They came out and said, 'Lads, we're still here, this team is still class'.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's 80 minutes, but it's 80 minutes in one of the hardest places to come and play. We've been hammered here before and it's a tough place to pick yourself up from afterwards.\"\n\nThere is still much work to be done, of course. Scotland's dramatic late victory over Wales in the later Saturday kick-off leaves Ireland third in the table, two points behind Gregor Townsend's side.\n\nFrance, who face Italy on Sunday, are a point above Ireland. After a much-needed rest week, Ireland still need to beat Wales and Scotland at home and hope France slip up somewhere along the way.\n\nBut Farrell thought better of being sucked into any title talk in the immediate aftermath against England. For him, a continuation of the progression Ireland showed on Saturday stands above all else.\n\n\"What will be will be, we just need to move on after this,\" he said.\n\n\"We have a fallow week. We'll review the start of the competition and see how much we've grown.\n\n\"The important part for us is to be keep on doing that in the last two weeks, and what will be will be, really.\"",

We introduce UniLID, a simple and efficient LID method based on the UnigramLM tokenization algorithm, leveraging its probabilistic framing, parameter estimation technique and inference strategy. In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon.

The 2023 and 2024 attacks used malicious floodfill routers and remain unattributed. When the 2026 attack began, most assumed it was the same state-sponsored operation continuing its annual disruption campaign. The assumption was wrong.\n\nThe attacker was identified as the Kimwolf botnet, an IoT botnet that infected millions of devices including streaming boxes and consumer routers throughout late 2025. Kimwolf is the same operation behind the record-setting 31.4 terabit per second DDoS attack in December 2025. The operators admitted on Discord they accidentally disrupted I2P while attempting to use the network as backup command-and-control infrastructure after security researchers destroyed over 550 of their primary C2 servers.\n\nThe I2P development team responded by shipping version 2.11.0 just six days after the attack began. The release includes hybrid ML-KEM plus X25519 post-quantum encryption enabled by default, making I2P one of the first production anonymity networks to ship post-quantum cryptography to all users. Additional Sybil mitigations, SAMv3 API upgrades, and infrastructure improvements were included.",

    "fullText": "It was the moment that turned the Six Nations Test match in favour of Scotland as the visitors quick thinking ruthlessly exposed Wales as they switched off in defence.\n\nIt allowed Scotland replacement wing Darcy Graham to score the try that changed the game.\n\nWales were leading 23-12 in the 58th minute after replacement fly-half Jarrod Evans had just slotted over a penalty.\n\nAn efficient home ball boy quickly presented the ball on the halfway line for Scotland to take a quick restart and Finn Russell and Graham did the rest.\n\nRussell took a quick drop out towards the vacant Welsh right hand side which caught the home defence napping.\n\nWales replacement flanker James Botham, who had an outstanding match, watched the ball drop over his shoulder with Graham, who had just come on the field, reacting the quickest.\n\nGraham outsprinted Wales wing Gabriel Hamer-Webb - who was running back after following up Evans' penalty kick - to stun the hosts with Russell's conversion reducing the deficit to four points.\n\nThe momentum switched with Scotland going on to win the game and break Welsh hearts.\n\nScotland battle back for Six Nations win over Wales\n\nReaction as Scotland complete Cardiff comeback\n\n\"It was huge in the game,\" said Wales head coach Steve Tandy.\n\n\"Test match rugby, you need to make people work for their opportunities and we feel we didn't do that in that moment.\n\n\"We were looking to extend the lead. It gave Scotland energy, where if we take the kick-off and get it off the field, that's seconds off the clock.\n\n\"It's another harsh lesson in some of the games. In high-class games, you can't knock off.\n\n\"We backed up moments in the game and handled our yellow card pretty well.\n\n\"There was some great stuff, the intent and physicality from the group was there, but that moment cost us.\"\n\nFormer England World Cup winning-captain Martin Johnson on BBC One: \"Wales will wake up tomorrow and they'll think the try straight off the kick-off has cost them the game. Not looking at the ball after a kick-off has cost them.\n\n\"It all comes down to fundamentals.

    "fullText": "Tries: Carre, Adams Cons: Costelow 2 Pens: Costelow 2, Evans\n\nTries: Steyn, Russell, Graham, Turner Cons: Russell 3\n\nScotland battled back to inflict a heartbreaking Six Nations defeat on Wales in a thrilling game in Cardiff.\n\nGregor Townsend's side trailed 20-5 and 23-12 but rallied in the second half with a 74th-minute try from replacement hooker George Turner sealing the victory.\n\nIt was the first time Scotland had led in the game after earlier tries from wing Kyle Steyn, replacement Darcy Graham and fly-half Finn Russell, who finished with 11 points.\n\nThe Graham try proved the turning point following some Russell magic and a Welsh defensive lapse from a restart.\n\nWales had scored tries from prop Rhys Carre and Josh Adams with 10 points from fly-half Sam Costelow.\n\nSteve Tandy's side will be devastated after a much-improved performance but Wales' three-year Six Nations losing streak continues.\n\nScotland will win a first Triple Crown since 1990 if they can beat Ireland in Dublin on 14 March.\n\nReaction as Scotland complete Cardiff comeback\n\n'Wales were sleeping!' Scotland score try straight from kick-off\n\n'Heartbreaking, sad, disgrace' – Wales fans react to state of game\n\nAfter an opening-day defeat by Italy in Rome, Scotland have bounced back with two victories.\n\nScotland have not beaten England, Ireland and Wales in the same tournament for 36 years.\n\nThe question was could Scotland buck the recent trend by backing up the impressive 31-20 win against England. The answer was yes after Scotland had lost six of their seven matches directly played after a win against England.\n\nIt is the first time Scotland have won four successive games against Wales for 100 years and the first back-to-back away success in Cardiff since 1984.\n\nWales have dropped to 12th in the world rankings while Scotland have risen two places to seventh.\n\nWales were outstanding in parts but have still suffered 14 successive Six Nations defeats in a streak stretching back to a win against Italy in Rome in March 2023 - some 1,078 days.\n\nThey have also lost 11 consecutive home matches in the tournament since beating Scotland in February 2022 - a gap of 1,470 days.\n\nWales have suffered a 24th defeat in 26 games since October 2023 and they have only won game in 15 matches at the Principality Stadium.\n\nBut the Wales team restored pride in front of their home fans with an encouraging performance, as Tandy just fell short against the Scottish side he had been defence coach for almost six years.\n\nHome captain Dewi Lake said before the game they had to get the Principality Stadium rocking. They certainly did that in front of 70,649.\n\nThere is a fallow week now before Townsend's side host France and face the trip to Dublin. Wales will also travel to play Ireland on 6 March before entertaining Italy eight days later.\n\nTandy's response to heavy opening defeats against England and France, in which Wales conceded 15 tries and 102 points, was to make four changes.\n\nUncapped Leicester wing Gabriel Hamer-Webb, Scarlets fly-half Sam Costelow , Dragons second-row Ben Carter and Scarlets flanker Taine Plumtree coming in for Ellis Mee, Dan Edwards, Adam Beard and Olly Cracknell.\n\nWales made shocking starts in the opening two games but ensured that was not the case on this occasion.\n\nPlumtree and Hamer-Webb both picked up injuries in the opening two minutes. Hamer-Webb was forced off briefly with a bloody nose before Plumtree was permanently replaced by James Botham because of a shoulder problem.\n\nWales' discipline was again poor in the opening exchanges with two soft penalties, before Joe Hawkins was sent to the bunker for a high tackle on Scotland flanker Gregor Brown, who had moved from lock to the back row from the victory over England to replace the injured Jamie Ritchie.\n\nWing Josh Adams made a couple of important early interventions with a crucial tackle on Scotland centre Huw Jones followed by a vital interception.\n\nWales rallied with 14 men and after a searing break from scrum-half Tomos Williams, the home side produced an identical successful tap penalty move to last week when Carre dived over after the initial drive from Lake.\n\nHawkins' card remained yellow as it was deemed a passive tackle but it was still an 11th sin-binning in Tandy's seven games in charge.\n\nScotland took advantage of the extra back with a sweeping move that was finished by Steyn.\n\nHawkins returned and his fellow Scarlets centre Eddie James, along with Lake, Carre and flanker Alex Mann, laid the foundations for Adams to cross for his 24th Wales try.\n\nCostelow, who was starting his first game since July 2025 with Edwards having played the past seven games, converted from the touchline.\n\nBotham was outstanding after his early introduction and a turnover laid the foundations for a Costelow penalty.\n\nScotland made a couple of early tactical substitutions as prop Pierre Schoeman and back rower Josh Bayliss came on for Nathan McBeth and Max Williamson, with Brown reverting to lock.\n\nAfter another storming Steyn break, a vital Mann turnover forced a penalty as Wales led 17-5 at half-time, the first time the home side had led under Tandy at the interval.\n\nThe 57,744 crowd against France was Wales' lowest home attendance in the Six Nations, but the Principality Stadium atmosphere was electric with a spectacular half-time show.\n\nCostelow slotted over his second penalty early to extend the deficit to 15 points.\n\nScotland showed the composure they had been lacking in the first half with a 27-phase move finished by Russell.\n\nWales lost Costelow to a leg injury with Jarrod Evans coming on and his first act was to slot over a simple penalty.\n\nScotland also made a raft of replacements, including the introduction of Edinburgh wing Graham for Van der Merwe.\n\nGraham made an immediate impact as the visitors capitalised on an unforgivable Welsh error and a moment of Russell ingenuity.\n\nBotham did not react quickly enough from the restart and Graham gathered a quick Russell kick-off and out-sprinted Hamer-Webb to equal Van der Merwe's Scotland try-scoring record. Russell converted from the touchline and the momentum shifted.\n\nWales scrum-half Williams was penalised for an illegal clearout when Wales had been initially been awarded a kickable penalty.\n\nThe decision was reversed with the home side denied a chance to go seven points clear.\n\nScotland captain Sione Tuipulotu then produced a strong tackle on Wales full-back Louis Rees-Zammit that yielded a penalty for the visitors but they could not initially take advantage.\n\nThe immense pressure was mounting on the Welsh defence with replacement Turner going over for the bonus-point try, with any hints of obstruction ignored by the officials.\n\nRussell slotted over the conversion and his late missed penalty was irrelevant as Scotland celebrated and Wales were left forlorn.\n\nWales: Rees-Zammit; Hamer-Webb, James, Hawkins, Adams; Costelow, T Williams; Carre, Lake (capt), Francis, Jenkins, Carter, Plumtree, Mann, Wainwright\n\nReplacements: Elias, Smith, Griffin, F Thomas, Botham, Hardy, J Evans, Murray\n\nScotland: Kinghorn; Steyn, H Jones, Tuipulotu (capt), van der Merwe; Russell, White; McBeth, Cherry, Z Fagerson, Williamson, Cummings, G Brown, Darge, M Fagerson\n\nReplacements: Turner, Schoeman, Mills, Gilchrist, Bayliss, G Horne, Jordan, Graham\n\nAssistant referees: Karl Dickson (RFU), Adam Leal (RFU)",

    "title": "Red cards and poor home form - Chelsea 'set fire to points'",
    "description": "Chelsea have more red cards than any side in the Premier League this season, and boss Liam Rosenior says they have \"set fire\" to points.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has inherited many of the problems that afflicted Enzo Maresca's side before him.\n\nAfter Burnley's 93rd‑minute equaliser in their 1-1 draw, Chelsea became the Premier League leaders for dropping points at home - 17 this season.\n\nThey also now have a league‑high six red cards this term, following Wesley Fofana's dismissal in the 72nd minute.\n\nThat red card ultimately led to Chelsea's subsequent collapse after Joao Pedro opened the scoring, with Rosenior lamenting that his side have \"set fire to four points\" after drawing 2-2 at home to Leeds in their previous league match.\n\n\"There's an inquest after every game whether we win or lose,\" Rosenior added.\n\nHowever, this is the first result to prompt such an angry reaction from the manager, who was appointed after Maresca left the club on New Year's Day following a falling-out with the hierarchy.\n\nRosenior continued: \"I'm learning about the players. I'm learning about the people you can lean on when things aren't going your way and you need to see a game out. That's something we need to address very quickly.\"\n\nThere was further frustration over goalscorer Zian Flemming being given a free header in the centre of Chelsea's box, with Burnley substitute Jacob Bruun Larsen missing a similar chance minutes later.\n\n\"A marking assignment was missed,\" Rosenior said. \"I'm not here to throw players under the bus - I will always protect my players, and I'll deal with it during the week.\n\n\"But there was a player assigned that duty who marked the wrong man.\"\n\nChelsea have equalled their highest number of red cards in a single Premier League season, matching the 2007‑08 campaign - but with 11 games still to play.\n\nOnly away at Nottingham Forest have Chelsea claimed all three points after going down to 10 men, holding on following an 87th‑minute dismissal.\n\nDefeats against Manchester United, Brighton and Fulham can largely be attributed to red cards earlier in those matches, while Chelsea rallied well after Moises Caicedo was sent off in the home draw with Arsenal in November.\n\nThe pattern is clear - Chelsea are suffering because of their lack of discipline. They are also a team accustomed to collecting yellow cards.\n\nThey sit bottom of the Fair Play table with 86 points, having received 60 yellow cards this season. They were second-bottom last season and bottom the season before.\n\nIt is hard not to link the disciplinary record to the age profile of the squad. Chelsea have not fielded a player over the age of 28 all season and have the youngest squad in the Premier League - a profile deliberately built by the club's hierarchy.\n\nHowever, Rosenior does not \n\n\"I think youth is one thing, accountability is another,\" he said. \"I'm accountable. I'm the head coach, I'm the manager of the team. I'm responsible for every result and every performance we have. We need players you can rely on in the moment to do their job.\n\n\"I know what we need to get there. It's not down to youth, it's down to assessing the players and identifying the ones you can rely on in difficult moments.\"\n\nRosenior also refused to single out Fofana and pointed out that the majority of red cards this season came before his appointment. Maresca himself was sent off for celebrating a last‑minute winner against Liverpool.\n\n\"Our discipline since I've come in - which is what I can speak about - has been very good,\" added Rosenior.\n\nChelsea have dropped a league‑high 17 points from winning positions at home and 19 in total - the second‑worst record in the Premier League behind West Ham on 20.\n\nIt is another area affected not only by red cards but also by an inability to finish teams off and defensive lapses, particularly from set-pieces.\n\nChelsea have conceded a league‑high 13.54 expected goals from set-pieces this season, resulting in 11 goals against.\n\nIt is unsurprising, therefore, that the combination of dead‑ball specialist Ward‑Prowse and an aerial presence such as Flemming contributed to the equaliser.\n\n\"Set plays are massive in the Premier League, they're so important. Our record this season, defending set plays, is not at the level required for us to achieve what we want to achieve, and that's something I need to address,\" Rosenior said.\n\nThere may also be a broader mentality issue, which again could be linked to the youthfulness of the squad - particularly within Chelsea's leadership group.\n\nAsked whether Chelsea have enough leaders, Rosenior simply replied \"Yes\", before adding: \"I think there are certain values you need to have in your team.\n\n\"The best teams, the teams that win titles - which is where we want to get to - win games 1-0 when they probably haven't played at their best.\n\n\"That should have been at least a 1-0 today. Even with 10 men for 25 minutes, that should have been a 1-0 at the least. I know what we need to get there. It's not down to youth, it's about assessing the players and identifying the ones you can rely on in difficult moments.\"\n\nChelsea were booed off at full‑time, and Rosenior's reaction may signal the end of a brief period of calm around Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt remains a promising start for the Englishman in his 11 games in charge, but he walked into a club already experiencing a febrile atmosphere, with anti‑ownership chants growing louder and fringe protests beginning to move into the mainstream.\n\nIt promises to be an interesting few weeks for Chelsea, with Arsenal, Aston Villa and Newcastle to come in a tougher run of Premier League fixtures.\n\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Chelsea - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Watch: Hearts v Falkirk - Sportscene highlights\n\nIt might not have been pretty, it was by a mere single goal, but Heart of Midlothian's victory over Falkirk is of the kind head coach Derek McInnes believes could prove to be \"the bedrock of success\" for his Scottish Premiership leaders.\n\nIt was much needed, given that last weekend's 4-2 defeat by Rangers allowed the hosts to narrow the gap at the top to two points.\n\nHearts returned to winning ways on Saturday, but it was far from comfortable against high-flying Falkirk.\n\nRecent signing Islam Chesnokov's toe-poke on the stroke of half-time was all that split the sides, leaving McInnes to admit he felt the \"anxiety\" at Tynecastle.\n\nThere was a slight nervousness around the Edinburgh stadium ahead of the game. On top of that defeat at Ibrox against their nearest challengers, Falkirk were returning to the scene of their penalty shoot-out win in the Scottish Cup just a few weeks ago.\n\nHowever, Hearts rode the wave of emotions, and dealt with the latest raft of injuries, to extend their lead at the top to five points before Rangers face bottom side Livingston on Sunday.\n\n\"Sometimes those 1-0 wins are the bedrock of any success a team can have,\" McInnes said. \"I think that's been demonstrated in history.\"\n\nMore of those will be more than welcome considering their title rivals are beginning to motor.\n\nDanny Rohl's Rangers have lost just once - away to Porto in the Europa League - in 14 outings since losing at Tynecastle in December.\n\nReigning champions Celtic, just six behind Hearts with two games in hand, have lost once in 11, albeit a bruising 4-1 Europa League loss at home to Stuttgart on Thursday, and rekindled their habit of vital late goals under interim manager Martin O'Neill.\n\nMotherwell, 10 behind with a game in hand, will surely also have a say in the destiny of the title given they have lost once in their latest 10.\n\nHearts' three wins in their latest seven outings are not quite as impressive, and McInnes admitted: \"The first half, there was a 20-25 minute period where we looked really anxious.\n\n\"Our out-of-possession stuff was good the whole game, but our in-possession stuff needed to be better.\"\n\nHowever, the Hearts boss thought that, overall, his side coped well with John McGlynn's dangerous Bairns.\n\n\"We were far better in the second half than we were first,\" he said. \"We were the team that looked more likely to score a second goal in the second half.\n\n\"I watch Falkirk often enough and they normally pepper teams, they normally put endless crosses in the box, they normally create so many chances.\n\n\"Very rarely do they not score. But it wasn't really like that. The second half, we were comfortable enough, we kept them away at arm's length.\n\n\"There were a lot of people tipping Falkirk to come here and win, but I thought we thoroughly deserved the win.\"\n\nBlair Spittal, drafted into the starting XI at the last minute following an injury to Ageu in the warm-up, agreed.\n\n\"It was a bit nervy at times, we made it hard for ourselves, but at this point of the season, it doesn't matter how you do it as long as you win,\" the midfielder said.\n\n\"We know the position we're in and it's important we don't look too far ahead. We just need to take care of ourselves.\"\n\nAs BBC Sportsound pundit Rory Loy suggested: \"They can tick that one off. Pressure well and truly applied.\"\n\nOver to Rangers in West Lothian and Celtic as they host Hibernian on Sunday.\n\nMcInnes added that \"of course\" it would be nice to be able to sit back and watch Hearts' rivals trying to reduce the deficit again, but he stressed: \"You can't get too obsessed.\n\n\"If you depend on others, you normally get let down. I'm just concentrating on my own team.\n\n\"We'll just deal with our own business as we go along and next Saturday's another chance to do it.\"\n\nWith five games until the Premiership splits into two halves for the final five games of the season, and no room for any more dropped points, it will no doubt be another case of any win will do.\n\nKris: A tough watch at times, but a win is a win is a win. Delighted Chesny [Chesnokov] got his goal. Hopefully he kicks on.\n\nRichard: Harry Milne in the second half, after Blair Spittal in the first half, provided the drive and the buzz around the field. Falkirk were competent and compact, Hearts were more expansive and were the slightly-better side, enough to deserve the win.\n\nAgeu injured again? About time players came with a warranty that they'll keep working for X miles or months or whatever, or they'll be repaired for free.\n\nSteve: Given our squad, Pierre Landry Kabore is never our number nine. Kabangu is worth a start or another Jamestown dud. The midfield is pedestrian and so fortunate to get this result.\n\nI fear, although getting three points, we are struggling to get results. Too many Jamestown duds.\n\nVisit our Hearts page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Hearts news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "Wales captain Dewi Lake labelled his team's late Six Nations defeat by Scotland as \"gut-wrenching\".\n\nWales looked set to end their 13-game losing streak with a dramatically improved performance in Cardiff.\n\nWales led from prop Rhys Carre's try in the ninth minute until George Turner's winning try for Scotland six minutes from time.\n\n\"It's gut-wrenching. It's a tough feeling because you know the performance was there,\" said Lake.\n\n\"We delivered the things we spoke about through the week. In the first half we were dominant – we applied pressure and attacked them.\n\n\"We've spoken a lot about staying in moments and didn't do that for the full 80 minutes, which is why the scoreboard went against us.\n\n\"We probably did enough to win the game, which makes it so tough.\"\n\nScotland battle back for Six Nations win over Wales\n\nReaction as Scotland complete Cardiff comeback\n\n'Kick of the age' - 40 years since Thorburn's monster\n\nTandy enjoyed an autumn win against Japan but was agonisingly close to a first statement victory of his reign.\n\nWales led at half-time for the first time since under his charge and were 20-5 and 23-12 in front at times of the second half. But ultimately they were left with just a losing bonus-point.\n\n\"I'm bitterly disappointed not to win the game but have massive pride in the group,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"That was a step in the right direction but we've got to be better next time. There was a lot to like in the first half with how we attacked the game. That was excellent.\"\n\nAfter French fans took over Principality Stadium in round two, Tandy hailed the impact of the home backing from a crowd of 70,649 inside the Principality Stadium.\n\n\"The support today was incredible. There are lots of questions asked about the crowds, but they were unbelievable,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Everyone felt it. The players gave them something to cheer about, but ultimately they got behind the team. It's a snapshot of what we want to be.\"\n\nScarlets pair Taine Plumtree and Sam Costelow look unlikely to play again in the tournament.\n\nBack-row Plumtree (shoulder) and fly-half Costelow (lower leg) are to undergo scans on Monday.\n\n\"Sam doesn't look good,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"He's been through a lot in his Wales career with not being involved in the autumn but we backed him to come back in and he really took that opportunity.\n\n\"He was fantastic with the way he drove the team forward in that first half. It's such a shame for him that it ended with injury.\"\n\nTandy was Scotland defence coach for six years and his gameplan earned the praise of his former boss.\n\n\"Tactically they were outstanding,\" said Gregor Townsend.\n\n\"Wales moved the ball quickly, played around the ruck which was tough to defend, their set-piece was excellent and defensively, which we probably hadn't seen from them. They targeted our breakdown and kept their width.\n\n\"They set up the team very well and they have some excellent players. We knew Wales would play well and knew the quality they have in the team.\n\n\"They deserved to be ahead and it took a huge effort to get back in the game and ahead on the scoreboard.\"",

    "fullText": "Home favourite Leigh Wood comfortably outpointed Josh Warrington in their grudge rematch at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena, securing a second victory over his British rival.\n\nWood dictated the tempo across 12 rounds against a frustrated, flat-footed Warrington.\n\nHe struggled to get his shots away as Wood cruised to a unanimous decision win with scores of 119-109, 119-109 and 117-111.\n\nWarrington said he would not \"rush\" any decision but suggested he may hang up the gloves after a fifth loss in 38 bouts.\n\n\"It's too tough a game to be turning up for an opponent and being second best,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"I'm a winner. The will to win is always going to be there but when something is missing it's too dangerous of a sport.\n\n\"I'm 35 now, I've got three beautiful kids at home and it's like how much do you keep on giving?\"\n\nThe 35-year-old 'Leeds Warrior' is a two-time featherweight world champion and stalwart of British boxing.\n\nWood, 37, is also a former featherweight world champion. He improves to 29 wins with four defeats and hinted this could be his last fight.\n\n\"What a fight to finish on if that is the last one. It's getting harder and harder to be away from my kids. They sacrifice as much as me,\" he said.\n\nTheir first fight in Sheffield had Warrington comfortably in control until a decisive Wood punch in the seventh round ended the contest.\n\nThe rivalry had only deepened since, reflected in the charged atmosphere of the sell-out 8,000-capacity arena as the football-loving fighters entered to songs of their respective clubs.\n\nWarrington walked out to the Leeds United anthem Marching On Together, which segued into his trademark Kaiser Chiefs' I Predict a Riot, but the travelling noise was outdone by the home crowd when Wood - wearing sunglasses and soaking in the moment - emerged to Nottingham Forest's Mull of Kintyre.\n\nWood edged a scrappy first round. Warrington responded with a sharp right hook and straight right in the second.\n\nThe home crowd sang \"Leigh Wood is one of our own\", as their man settled into a southpaw rhythm, slowing the pace and picking shots from range.\n\nHe landed a crisp combination in the fifth before Warrington drew blood from Wood's nose with a single right.\n\nBoth men had lost to Anthony Cacace since their first fight, raising the stakes for what felt like a last roll of the dice. Yet it was Warrington who looked the more faded former champion.\n\n\"Give them something to sing about,\" urged his father and trainer Sean O'Hagan, predicting Wood would tire.\n\nInstead, the bout drifted. Wood, hands low, invited pressure but Warrington could not capitalise. The lull in action seeped into the stands.\n\nWood and Warrington to consider retirement after rematch - reaction\n\nBriton Ryan becomes two-weight world champion\n\nThe sequel lacked the drama of their first fight. Instead, it became a question of who had more left in the tank.\n\nThe build-up to the rematch was intensely personal. Warrington described Wood as a \"slimy character\", while Wood called Warrington \"horrible\".\n\nWarrington likened his rival to a journeyman, and Wood fired back, branding him an area-level fighter.\n\nHow much of it was talk and how much genuine animosity matters little now - both can be celebrated for their achievements and standing in British boxing.\n\nA fight at the City Ground, home of Nottingham Forest, was always Wood's dream, but at this stage of his career it seems unlikely to come to fruition.\n\n\"If there is a great offer for the one place I want to fight [City Ground], I'd probably consider it,\" Wood said.\n\nHe added: \"I'm not coming out to get flattened out in front of my own crowd.\"\n\nShould he retire, he leaves a legacy as a resilient, powerful and entertaining fighter with memorable nights to his name. He will go down as a legend in his city.\n\nFor Warrington, this appears to be the final chapter. He debuted in 2009 and cemented his place on the global stage with high-profile victories over the likes of Lee Selby and Carl Frampton.\n\nHaving briefly retired in 2024, the lure of the big nights brought him back. But after this defeat, the fighter who once drove around Leeds in his rickety car trying to sell tickets can leave knowing he gave the sport everything he had.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri and Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana have spoken out on social media after both were sent racist abuse following the clubs' Premier League match on Saturday.\n\nChelsea's French defender Fofana, who was sent off for a second yellow card in the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, shared several screenshots of private messages he received on Instagram after the game.\n\nHe then posted a message which read: \"2026, it's still the same thing, nothing changes. These people are never punished.\n\n\"You create big campaigns against racism, but nobody actually does anything.\"\n\nEarlier Burnley's Tunisia international Mejbri shared an image of an offensive message on Instagram and in another post wrote: \"It's 2026 and there are still people like that. Educate yourself and your kids, please.\"\n\nChelsea said they were \"appalled and disgusted\" by the \"vile\" abuse, saying it was \"abhorrent and will not be tolerated\".\n\nIn a statement they added: \"Such behaviour is completely unacceptable and runs counter to the values of the game and everything we stand for as a club. There is no room for racism.\n\n\"We stand unequivocally with Wes. He has our full support, as do all our players who are too often forced to endure this hatred simply for doing their job. We will work with the relevant authorities and platforms in identifying the perpetrators and take the strongest possible action.\"\n\nBurnley said they were \"disgusted\" by the abuse, adding in a statement: \"The club has reported the post to Instagram's parent company, Meta, and expects strong support from them, together with the Premier League and the police, and will work to ensure that the individual responsible is identified and investigated.\n\n\"There is no place for this in our society and we condemn it unreservedly.\n\n\"The club continues to be unequivocal in its stance – we have a zero-tolerance approach to any form of discrimination.\n\n\"Hannibal will receive the full backing from the club and from the Burnley fans, who we have already seen condemning the abuse. There is no room for racism.\"\n\nThe Premier League has condemned the abuse and said \"any individuals identified and found guilty of discrimination will face the strongest possible consequences, including club bans and legal prosecution\".\n\nThey are the latest incidences of racist abuse towards players this season and come days after the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr during a Champions League match against Benfica, which Uefa is investigating.\n\nLast November, a BBC investigation found that more than 2,000 extremely abusive social media posts - including death and rape threats - were sent about managers and players in the Premier League and Women's Super League in a single weekend.\n\nIn August, the season opening Premier League game between Liverpool and Bournemouth was stopped in the first half after then Cherries forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd.\n\nA Liverpool man has denied the abuse and his trial is scheduled to take place in April.\n\nIn January, Newcastle United said they had contacted the police after midfielder Joe Willock was the subject of \"disgusting\" racial abuse and \"deeply disturbing threats\" on social media.\n\nTottenham forward Mathys Tel was the subject of racist abuse on social media after being one of two Spurs players to miss in their Super Cup penalty shootout defeat by Paris St-Germain in August.\n\nEngland defender Jess Carter was also the target of racist abuse during Euro 2025 in July.\n\nAnd England internationals Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all subjected to racism in the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Meta for a response.\n\nLatest Burnley news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Burnley - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "As Manchester City continue to crank up the pressure on Arsenal, Pep Guardiola tells his players to take three days off to \"enjoy life\" with \"caipirinhas and daiquiris\".",
    "fullText": "The sight of a beaming Pep Guardiola pumping his fists to all sides of Etihad Stadium then telling his players to indulge in cocktails demonstrated the magnitude of this Manchester City victory.\n\nOn a night of nerves and tension, City overcame Newcastle United to secure a 2-1 win that sent a loud and ominous message: \"Over to you, Arsenal.\"\n\nGuardiola was so satisfied with the win that he announced his players could have three days off, telling them to \"enjoy life\" with \"caipirinhas and daiquiris\".\n\nWhether they take his advice literally remains to be seen, but the celebrations were significant in the afterglow of victory.\n\nCity's win leaves them only two points behind the Gunners, who showed signs of creaking under pressure as they cast aside a two-goal lead to draw with relegation certainties Wolverhampton Wanderers in midweek.\n\nAnd Guardiola's animated, emotional reaction at the final whistle on Saturday was mirrored around the stadium on a night when he said: \"The connection we had with our fans was the best of the season. We had the best vibes and we need those vibes between now and the end of the season.\n\n\"It wasn't the ideal game, but we were a team and this is what we have to do at this stage of the season.\"\n\nThis may not be the same City side, when it comes to personnel, that made a habit of stringing together unstoppable sequences of results to break the hearts of Liverpool and Arsenal in title races of the past.\n\nCity still, however, have the manager and winner in Guardiola who knows how to navigate the course and distance – and this win has cranked up the pressure on Arsenal ahead of the north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday.\n\nHe believes 70% of his current squad have not been down this title road, but there are still plenty who have, such as Ruben Dias and Rodri to name two, and most importantly Guardiola himself.\n\nMikel Arteta's Arsenal must now respond against their arch-rivals, who will have new interim manager Igor Tudor in the dug-out.\n\nThis may not be the fluent City of recent past, but they showed steel to dig deep as Newcastle made light of their 5,000-mile round trip to Azerbaijan to face Qarabag in the Champions League play-off, pushing them all the way.\n\nLeading by example was the giant figure of Erling Haaland, not by dealing in his usual currency of goals, but with lung-busting work-rate, intense pressing, towering defensive headers, and a perfect cross for what turned out to be the winner from Nico O'Reilly as he headed in the second of his two goals.\n\nGuardiola acknowledged Haaland's contribution as he said: \"He was man of the match. Without Erling it would not have been possible.\"\n\nO'Reilly was another stellar contributor, with those two goals and an outstanding display of versatility playing behind City's attackers that will make intriguing viewing for England head coach Thomas Tuchel.\n\nHe is viewed as a left-back, but this showed he has other strings to his bow, while Newcastle United's Lewis Hall also got on the scoresheet and showed enough to suggest he is another viable defensive World Cup option for Tuchel.\n\nCity may not have the machine-like fluency and relentless winning style of the Guardiola teams that won four straight Premier League titles, but those memories can still kick in for plenty who will play their part in coming weeks.\n\nOne of the newer faces is giant Italian keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, a Champions League winner with Paris St-Germain last season, who is now chasing new honours and horizons with Manchester City.\n\nIn some respects he is a flawed keeper, especially under crosses, but has that uncanny, priceless habit of making stunning match-winning saves that makes up for other failings.\n\nHe did it with an astonishing stoppage time save from Alexis Mac Allister in a City win at Liverpool that may yet be regarded as the pivotal moment in their season, and he did it again here.\n\nAs the final seconds ticked on with Newcastle pressing for a point, Donnarumma employed that giant wingspan to stretch away low to his right to turn away Harvey Barnes' goal-bound shot.\n\nSeconds later, the final whistle went and Etihad Stadium was awash with celebration.\n\nTime will tell just how important those saves - those wins - will be, but City are now in a position from which they have flourished before.\n\nWin all their games. Win the Premier League.\n\nNow the scenery shifts to north London - along with the pressure - as Arsenal face that dangerous trip to Spurs.\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "\"Everyone has to take a look at themselves\" - what went wrong for England in their record Six Nations home defeat by Ireland?",
    "fullText": "Before the Six Nations started, England head coach Steve Borthwick talked about the game against France in Paris on 14 March being a possible title decider.\n\n\"We want to be in a position in that game to get what we all want to achieve. We want English fans flooding across the channel to get there and watch that game,\" he said.\n\nA repeat of the 2016 Grand Slam in Paris and a first title since 2020 was the goal.\n\nInstead, two heavy back-to-back defeats have left England in fourth place in the standings and out of the title race, with just one win against Wales to show for their efforts.\n\nEngland's 12-game winning streak went up in smoke with a 31-20 loss to Scotland at Murrayfield last week, before their nine-match winning home run was emphatically ended with Saturday's equally dismal 42-21 defeat by Ireland.\n\nThe manner of those defeats raises questions about Borthwick's tactics and his team's mentality.\n\nThey also leave England needing to pick up points from away games against Italy and France to even finish mid-table.\n\nIt was a nightmare performance at Allianz Stadium, with five tries conceded in one of the worst performances of Borthwick's tenure.\n\n\"Two weeks ago after 12 wins on the bounce people were saying we were the best team in the world, and now we are all sorts of things. Neither of these are true,\" Borthwick told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We are on a journey of development that has a lot of growth in it. That England team from today will be a lot better in two weeks' time.\"\n\nIreland scored 22 points inside the first 30 minutes - the fourth-most first-half points conceded by England at home.\n\nThat followed England going 17-0 down in 15 minutes against Scotland at Murrayfield.\n\n\"Fast starts are not about being physical and smashing them, that is a given, you are running out for your country,\" former England scrum-half Matt Dawson told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"It's the tactics. It's about how you are going to play, where you will play and how they will play.\n\n\"It's individual preparation and the understanding of how to play professional sport, not just rugby. Have you got that mentality to adapt from minute one?\n\n\"England, when it goes badly in the first 10 minutes, they are yet to find a methodology or a way out of it.\"\n\nFormer England fly-half Paul Grayson added: \"From nowhere England pulled out a performance that lacked accuracy, energy and emotion.\n\n\"The Twickenham crowd were making a heck of a racket at the start but 30 minutes in there were ironic cheers for making touch with a kick.\"\n\nBorthwick has been here before as England boss. In 2023 his side shipped 53 points at home to France but later that year they were minutes away from making a World Cup final.\n\n\"England had a chance against Ireland to show the Murrayfield nightmare was just a blip, but instead things were even worse, with the defence porous, accuracy non-existent, and the gameplan exposed,\" said BBC rugby correspondent Chris Jones.\n\n\"All the momentum and confidence generated from that 12-month winning run has evaporated in the space of 160 minutes of rugby.\n\n\"England's tactics have been picked apart by Scotland and Ireland, and Borthwick will need to react and adapt if they are to salvage their campaign in Rome and Paris.\"\n\nAfter seven dynamic caps off the bench, 21-year-old back rower Henry Pollock finally gained a first Test start.\n\nThe idea was his energy would help avoid a repeat of last week when Scotland blitzed England in the opening 20 minutes.\n\n\"What do you do? Two weeks in a row conceding so many points in the first 15 minutes,\" prop forward Ellis Genge told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Everyone has to take a look at themselves. No-one knows what the answer is right now or we would have sorted it out.\n\n\"It opened up scar tissue from last week - we have to be better at managing that period and stop turning the ball over.\n\n\"It's brutal, professional sport because if you get 5% wrong it's gone. We probably believed the hype from the first week too much. We can't let the noise in now.\n\n\"We have let everyone down. Apologies for that but I promise we will make it better. We are going to go away and work as hard as we can to go away and rectify things.\"\n\nEngland found themselves deep in Ireland's 22 on multiple occasions but lacked any clinical edge, making 14 handling errors in the game.\n\nGeorge Ford also missed touch with a penalty that could have put the hosts in a scoring position.\n\n\"As players, senior players and the leadership team we have to take responsibility for not starting the game right,\" said Itoje.\n\n\"It was just our inaccuracy. We turned the ball over too much, and when we did get into positions to hurt Ireland we were not accurate and then gave ourselves a mountain to climb.\"\n\nAn England blip, or long-term cause for concern?\n\nEngland v Ireland as it happened plus match reaction\n\nRuthless Ireland hit record away win over England\n\nIreland took advantage of England's poor one-on-one tackling to make 12 line breaks.\n\nStuart McCloskey's clean break leading to Ireland's second try came after replacement Jack van Poortvliet, who had not long arrived on the field in place of the injured Alex Mitchell, overshot the read, with Ollie Lawrence then fended off.\n\nFraser Dingwall was beaten on the outside by Robert Baloucoune, who dummied Tommy Freeman and then escaped Lawrence, for the third score.\n\nIreland captain Caelan Doris then broke through Genge to sprint clear and help set up Dan Sheehan's bonus-point try early in the second half.\n\n\"In the first 30 minutes of a Test match collisions should be massive, but England were not even making contact and were getting rinsed down the middle of the field two or three times,\" added Grayson.\n\n\"England were utterly dreadful in defence.\"\n\nBaloucoune and Sheehan's tries both resulted in yellow cards from scrambling defence by Freddie Steward and Pollock, which further added to England's problems.\n\nEngland's kick-heavy strategy was key in their 12-game winning run, but against Scotland they failed to win the aerial battle.\n\nFreeman's switch back from outside centre to the right wing was with the view of improving in that area.\n\nThe 24-year-old had a mixed day in the air against Ireland, but still managed to compete when called upon.\n\nGiven Ireland lost James Lowe early to injury, utilising Freeman against O'Brien early on could have brought some change.\n\nInstead, Leinster's O'Brien managed to regather a kick that eventually led to Baloucoune's try.\n\nIreland simply won the aerial battle, also taking advantage of the height difference between the 6ft 4in Baloucoune and Henry Arundell, who is four inches shorter.\n\nArundell, 23, was backed to respond from his red card against Scotland and failed to enforce himself.\n\nImmanuel Feyi-Waboso's championship-ending injury is proving a vital moment in England's campaign.\n\nWhat was once their biggest strength is now becoming a weakness.\n\nEngland 6-42 South Africa, 2008",

    "description": "Scotland displayed a different side of their personality in the dramatic comeback victory over Wales in Cardiff, writes Tom English.",
    "fullText": "Amid the maelstrom of the closing minutes in Cardiff there was a slightly comedic moment. As the upset to end all upsets loomed large, Scotland pounded hard at the Welsh line, their desperation in full flow, the home defiance bordering on the heroic.\n\nInside the Principality, the noise was deafening, The head thudded, the ears split. Wales in crisis? Nobody seemed to tell Dewi Lake or Rhys Carre or their locks and back-rows and midfielders, who were awesome.\n\nCrisis, yes. But for Scotland. Wales were not looking like a team that had lost 23 out of their previous 25 games, who had come into this as no-hopers with the bookmakers. They were tired men, though. They were flagging with the finishing line in sight.\n\nThis was such a familiar nightmare for the Scots, their darkest fears in play, their rugby sanity at stake. Wales led 23-19. They had outgunned Scotland, routing them at the breakdown, stifling their lethal runners, battering them in the collisions.\n\nBut Scotland were fighting back, they were beginning to rise above their own shortcomings. In that moment, as Scotland rumbled off a close-range lineout, the giant screens flashed a message for the Welsh fans: \"Get louder,\" it demanded.\n\nLouder? You cannot be serious. The temptation was to laugh because the place couldn't have been any more electrified, but the drama down below didn't allow for mirth. It was wonderfully tense, a game of psychology as much as a game of rugby.\n\nScotland show 'bottle' & 'grit' in 'ugly' Cardiff win\n\nPodcast: Reaction to Scotland's dramatic Cardiff comeback\n\nScotland battle back for Six Nations win over Wales\n\nSeconds later, George Turner piled over and, at last, Scotland were ahead for the first time in their stressful day. Finn Russell made it a three-point game with the boot and the visitors saw it out from there.\n\nThey looked exhausted and relieved on full-time, like they'd had a brush with ghosts rather than dragons. Sione Tuipulotu said they had to dig deep and that was true.\n\nThey dug and dug and dug. It was error-strewn and maddening at times but they kept at it. If they only rarely managed to show their class, they displayed character when the heat was at its most intense. Cool heads amid the desperation won the day.\n\nWinning ugly is a concept that has seemed beyond Scotland for years. For the most part, at any rate. They normally win with a flourish or not at all. This was an ugly one, but magnificent at the same time.\n\nThey were asked all sorts of questions and came up with enough answers. It was seriously flawed but that made the manner of the win all the more laudable. They were losing 20-5 after 47 minutes and won the remainder of it 21-3 even though never coming close to playing their best stuff. How can you not salute that spirit?\n\nLast week we saw them win with panache, this week we saw them win through belligerence and character. Two different styles but the same precious five points.\n\nAfter the torment of defeat in week one, Scotland are top of the table. They'll drop to second if France beat Italy on Sunday, but second after three games is rarefied air for Gregor Townsend and his team.\n\nWales? Brilliant but beaten, losers on the day but with so much to build on - and a little bit to complain about, too. If that Turner try ended up being the decisive moment in the game there was another moment, on 64 minutes, that could have filled that slot.\n\nWales were ahead 23-19 at the time. Into the Scotland 22 they went and won a penalty. They could have backheeled it over, had it stood, which it didn't. The TMO got involved and a call was made against Tomos Williams for a croc roll on Rory Darge that didn't look like a croc roll.\n\nPenalty reversed. A shot for 26-19 gone. Turner drove over soon after and that was that. Back from the cliff edge Scotland stepped and into the coming weeks they go with France to play at home and Ireland away.\n\nA formidable finale to their tournament, but at least they're alive and not without hope of achieving something tangible. Whatever happens against France they will be playing for a Triple Crown in Dublin. They haven't won it since 1990.\n\nWhat is it about this fixture that produces such hair-raisers? What is it about those Scotland jerseys that makes the Welsh believe in themselves?\n\nFrom the get-go, they were terrific. Scotland forced things and got found out. They tried to go wide at every turn, but got smashed. Even when Joe Hawkins was binned after five minutes Wales grew stronger. Carre scored while they were down to 14. Those awful Welsh starts in so many recent Test matches? Forget it.\n\nScotland coughed up chances, then scored one, then conceded another. They had little composure and no control. Wales would not allow it. Sam Costelow made it 17-5 after half an hour. Red flags all over the place now.\n\nTownsend didn't hang about. Thirty-five minutes played and he hauled off Nathan McBeth, his loosehead, and Max Williamson, one of his locks. Fortunes did not change, not immediately. Scotland's looseness carried on. So did the Welsh scoring; 20-5 now.\n\nFatalism kicks in at that point. Here we go again. Another Cardiff catastrophe. Jungle drums beating. Townsend must go. Everybody must go.\n\nHuw Jones, one of the most formidable attackers in the history of the Scotland team, dropped a ball with the try-line close at hand. When the likes of Jones are making a mess of things you start to fear the worst. You crank up the obits.\n\nInstead of an implosion we saw Scotland reversing the narrative. Russell darted over to make it 20-12. Jarrod Evans stretched it to 23-12, but what happened next was remarkable.\n\nRussell restarted. He spotted space and dropped his kick into the no-man's land Wales offered him, Darcy Graham reading his mind and speeding on to it. As James Botham slept, his back turned to the play, Graham pounced.\n\nA kindly bounce and he was in for a blink-and-you-miss-it score. A colossal Welsh failing to some eyes, a piece of Russell genius to others.\n\nThe tension - raw and exhilarating - continued. The Williams croc roll and the siege lifted on the back of it. The sense of impending Welsh doom only for the Scots to lose ball on the floor just as they threatened to motor. The Turner try and the Scotland scrum penalty at the end. They cleared the lines and escaped to victory.\n\nLater, Pierre Schoeman suggested it was a bigger win than last week's victory over England. You can see where he was coming from. The rugby world knows Scotland can beat England, but not many folk knew they could come from so many points down in an unforgiving place to win a battle.\n\nThey showed a different side of their personality on Saturday, a terrible beauty on an extraordinary day.",

It was the second time the Canadians had beaten them in five days.\n\n\"I'm a bit in shock. I think we felt like we were the better team. I don't know what to say,\" a tear-choked Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nWhat do curlers do when they're not at the Olympics?\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nAfter the epic semi-final win over Switzerland on Thursday, Mouat referred to it as \"our gold medal\". Presumptuous? Perhaps. But that belief was founded in fact.\n\nHis rink have won two World Championships and a couple of European crowns as well as a record 12 Grand Slam titles since the last Games.\n\nFurthermore, they boast an excellent record against the Canadians and beat them in last year's world semis. Jacobs' time-served team did win the round-robin meeting earlier in the week but that was a rare reverse.\n\nIn that contest, GB led after six ends before slipping to the 9-5 defeat that left them needing favours from other teams.\n\nIt was the same this time, a fabulous Mouat double-takeout edging GB 5-4 ahead at that stage after a cagey opening half during which he and 2014 gold-medallist Brad Jacobs traded points.\n\nCanada - who have had a tumultuous time of it themselves here amid cheating claims - drew level after seven, but Britain had the advantage of the hammer in two of the final three ends.\n\nThey could not make the most of that though.\n\nJust one in the eighth for GB gave Canada the sniff of an opportunity and that snatched it ruthlessly, capitalising on some slack stones in the ninth to lead 8-6 going into the last.\n\nMouat had the hammer but he needed two to force an extra end. Could the man considered the best shot-maker in world come up with the goods in the biggest moment?\n\nHe couldn't. And for the second Olympics in a row, the GB rink were left with a medal that they did not want.\n\n\"We wanted to win it for each other,\" an emotional Hardie told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The pain from four years ago was so much that we wanted to give it another go. We gave ourselves a chance but unfortunately we've not got there again.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are slightly higher this weekend. According to the Zillow lender marketplace, the current 30-year fixed rate is 5.86%, up five basis points. The 15-year fixed rate is up six basis points to 5.41%. Why does Zillow report mortgage rates that are lower than those reported elsewhere? We cover that near the bottom of this page.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% offers nearly double: Mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nDiscover 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rates.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nWant to refinance your mortgage in 2026? Here's what to do.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You also have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues, if applicable. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped with those of the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDig deeper into 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to get an adjustable-rate mortgage.\n\nFirst of all, now is a good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.\n\nMortgage rates have also dropped since this time last year.\n\nThe best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.\n\nWhich is more important, your home price or mortgage rate?\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.86% right now. Why are Zillow's rates usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac (which reported 6.01% this week) and elsewhere? Each source compiles rates by different methods. Zillow obtains rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. However, mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code, by lender, loan type, and many other factors. That's why it's so important to shop with multiple mortgage lenders.\n\nAre interest rates expected to go down?\n\nNot much. According to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.1% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nOverall, mortgage rates have dropped gradually since the end of May last year. The 30-year fixed rate topped out over 7% in January 2025, then bounced higher and lower for months. On May 29 2025, the 30-year rate was 6.89%, and began slowly moving down.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score. Learn how to lower your refi costs, both at closing and long term.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Here's what you should know if you want to refinance your mortgage loan in early 2026.",

    "fullText": "If you own a GMC truck in Houston, this story may hit close to home.\n\nA River Oaks resident says he did everything right. His truck was parked in his driveway. The area was well-lit. A surveillance camera with a spotlight pointed directly at the vehicle. It was not tucked away in a dark corner of the street. It was sitting right outside his home, in plain view.\n\nAccording to a report aired by FOX 26 Houston, the theft happened around 3:30 a.m. The owner had no idea until hours later. He woke up Friday morning around 6:30 and began getting ready for work. At about 8 a.m., he walked into the driveway, just like he does every day. He pressed the unlock button on his key fob and looked up.\n\n“I was honestly just in complete shock,” he told reporter Jillian Hartmann.\n\nEvery car is special, but this one is particularly special to its owner. He described it as his first major purchase. Something he worked hard for. Something he had paid off. In a matter of minutes, it was taken.\n\nThe brazen nature of the theft makes this case especially unsettling. The homeowner says he has a driveway camera aimed directly at where the truck was parked. After realizing the vehicle was missing, he checked the footage on his phone.\n\nSure enough, the recording showed the theft unfolding in the early morning hours.\n\nThe suspects appeared unfazed by the cameras. The driveway was fully illuminated. A spotlight from the camera lit up the scene. Yet the thieves carried on without hesitation. The victim believes they were professionals. He said the theft took very little time.\n\nEven more concerning is the apparent targeting.\n\nThe homeowner noted there are more than 100 vehicles parked along his street overnight. Despite that, the suspects specifically chose his GMC truck. It was not hidden. It was not isolated. It was not easier to access compared to other cars parked on the street. And still, it was the one they took.\n\nThe victim later saw a previous FOX 26 report detailing a rise in GMC truck thefts across the Houston area. That is when it clicked.\n\n“I had no idea I had a sitting duck in my driveway,” he said.\n\nHis shock didn’t come from just losing the truck. It was more about how easy the operation looked. He acknowledged that car theft is common in Houston, but like many owners, he never expected it to happen to him.\n\nThere is a particular sting to walking outside and seeing an empty parking space where your vehicle once sat. No broken glass. No loud alarm woke the neighborhood. Just silence and an empty driveway. It hits the kind of different that only people unfortunate enough to have experienced it can truly understand.\n\nThe resident says he is speaking out to raise awareness within the GMC truck community. His warning is simple. If you own one, pay attention. Extra lighting and visible cameras may not be enough deterrent.\n\nHouston police are investigating the case. Authorities are urging anyone with information to contact HPD.\n\nFor truck owners, this incident underscores a growing concern. High-demand vehicles often become high-priority targets.\n\nAnd targeting comes in different shades.\n\nWe recently ran the story of a North Georgia dealership salesman who allegedly targeted and sold a $90k pickup to an elderly man with dementia. He even traveled 40 miles to the man’s home and then drove him back to the dealership to close the deal.\n\nProfessional theft crews can move quickly, sometimes in under a minute, using increasingly sophisticated methods. In many cases, by the time the owner realizes something is wrong, the vehicle is already far from the neighborhood where it was parked.\n\nFor this River Oaks resident, the experience has been a harsh wake-up call. What felt secure one night turned out to be anything but. And for GMC owners across Houston, his story is a reminder that convenience and familiarity can sometimes create a false sense of safety.\n\nThe driveway may feel like the safest place to park. In this case, it was not.\n\nEditorial Note: Video playback may be limited on some platforms.

    "fullText": "Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce are dealing with a lawsuit tied to the name of their Kansas City restaurant, 1587 Prime.\n\nA sneaker brand has filed a trademark infringement claim against the Chiefs teammates and their restaurant partners, asserting that the use of “1587” conflicts with its own branding.\n\nAt the center of the dispute is the shared number combination used by both businesses. The legal battle now hinges on whether the two brands can operate under similar marks in different industries.\n\nThe complaint was brought by 1587 Sneakers, which says it began selling footwear under that name on April 13, 2023.\n\nThe restaurant’s title merges Mahomes’ No. 15 and Kelce’s No. 87, a pairing the sneaker company argues it had already established in commerce.\n\nCourt records show that 1587 Prime applied for its trademark in December 2023 in the restaurant category, while 1587 Sneakers filed its application last October in the clothing category.\n\nThe sneaker brand claims that “scores of consumers” have reached out believing the two ventures are connected.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to bar the restaurant group from continuing to use the 1587 branding, halt the sale of related merchandise, and secure unspecified damages.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark attorney not involved in the matter, indicated the sneaker company could face challenges proving infringement.\n\nHe noted that trademarks are often allowed to coexist across separate business sectors unless consumer confusion is clearly shown.\n\n“I think it’s a tough case for the sneaker company,” Gerben said. “Trademarks can coexist in different industries. … Given that the marks are essentially identical here, is a restaurant and a shoe company too close? Are consumers likely to be confused in thinking they are affiliated with one another?”\n\nA publicist for Kelce declined to comment, and a representative for Mahomes did not respond to inquiries. The outcome will determine whether the restaurant can continue operating under its current name.\n\n‘Shut up’ – Chris Jones fires back after ESPN analyst says Chiefs should move on from Travis Kelce\n\nWhat ‘difficult’ Travis Kelce decision should Kansas City Chiefs make, reveals ESPN insider\n\nTravis Kelce hits fan again during Pebble Beach Pro-Am in third golf incident",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell are fighting the requested release of 90,000 pages related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, saying a law used to force the public release of millions of documents is unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawyers filed papers late Friday in Manhattan federal court to try to block the release of documents from a since-settled civil defamation lawsuit brought a decade ago by the late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell. The Justice Department recently asked a judge to lift secrecy requirements on the files.\n\nMaxwell's attorneys said the Justice Department obtained the documents — otherwise subject to secrecy orders — improperly during its criminal probe of Maxwell. They said the documents include transcripts of over 30 depositions and private information regarding financial and sexual matters related to Maxwell and others.\n\nSome records from the year-long exchange of evidence in the lawsuit battle were already released publicly in response to a federal appeals court order.\n\nMaxwell’s lawyers say a law Congress passed in December to force the release of millions of Epstein-related documents violates the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.\n\n“Congress cannot, by statute, strip this Court of the power or relieve it of the responsibility to protect its files from misuse. To do so violates the separation of powers,” wrote the lawyers, Laura Menninger and Jeffrey Pagliuca about the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\n“Under the Constitution’s separation of powers, neither Congress nor the Executive Branch may intrude on the judicial power. That power includes the power to definitively and finally resolve cases and disputes,” the lawyers added.\n\nThe release of Epstein-related documents from criminal probes that began weeks ago has resulted in new revelations about Epstein's decades-long sexual abuse of women and teenage girls. Some victims have complained that their names and personal information were revealed in documents while the names of their abusers were blacked out.\n\nMembers of Congress have complained that only about half of existing documents, many with redactions, have been made public even as Justice Department officials have said everything has been released, except for some files that can't be made public until a judge gives the go-ahead.\n\nGiuffre said Epstein had trafficked her to other men, including the former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. She sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17.\n\nHe denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022. Days ago, he was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours on suspicion of misconduct in having shared confidential trade information with Epstein.\n\nIn a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn’t include her in the sex trafficking prosecution of Maxwell because they didn’t want her allegations to distract the jury.\n\nMaxwell, 64, was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein took his own life in a federal lockup in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\n\nTwo weeks ago, she declined to answer questions from House Oversight Committee lawmakers in a deposition conducted in a a video call to her federal prison camp, though she indicated through a statement from her lawyer that she was “prepared to speak fully and honestly” if granted clemency.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.",
