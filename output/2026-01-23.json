    "description": "Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider won the 2026 PFWA Executive Of The Year award today.",
    "fullText": "Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider won the PFWA Executive Of The Year award today.\n\nThe Professional Football Writers of America put out a press release Thursday announcing their on field awards, in which Schneider was named as the winner. He’s the first Seahawk to win the award since it was created in 1993. He’s been a strong candidate in many of his 17 years in charge, with the team having three different eras of success within the timespan- each of which he rebuilt and retooled the roster to major success through all available avenues.\n\nThis doesn’t come as a shock to the Seattle media sphere because of that. Almost every voice covering the Seahawks has called for this to be the year he finally wins. Having the confidence to move off the past coach’s players despite their stardom and leadership allowed him to make the team new and exciting enough to go from good to great. Trading Geno Smith and D.K. Metcalf put him under scrutiny, under which he proved he deserved this year’s award. Ten months later, he’s won it, and has a chance to add a third NFC Championship and a second Super Bowl ring to his resume in the coming weeks.\n\nSchneider’s best trait isn’t just winning trades, though- he’s considered by many around football to be the best personnel guy there is. His draft record is outstanding, littered with Pro Bowlers, Hall of Famers, and other legends. Just this year, Grey Zabel at the 18th pick was exactly what the team needed, Nick Emmanwori at 35 has dictated how the entire NFC can play offense, Tory Horton looked like a steal in the 5th Round before getting hurt, and Robbie Ouzts has become a major contributor. In past years, he’s had some of the best rounds in draft history, selecting All-Pros Devon Witherspoon and Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the first round in 2023, and selecting future Hall of Famers Russell Wilson and Bobby Wagner just 28 picks apart in 2012.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks general manager John Schneider wins Executive Of The Year",

    "description": "The Capitals haven't been able to get much going consistently since Dec. 5, and now, they're trying to find a fix — and fast.",
    "fullText": "It's easy to sense the frustration among the Washington Capitals right now.\n\nAfter dropping their fourth straight game, this time a 4-3 decision to a Vancouver Canucks team that sits last in the standing and had lost 11 straight entering Wednesday's contest, the Capitals were again left looking for answers to issues that have been evident since the start of December.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we're just making too many big mistakes,\" coach Spencer Carbery said postgame after the loss to Vancouver. \"I sound like a broken record, but that's just the reality of it. We're making massive, massive mistakes. And it's throughout — you just can't in this league, it's just too competitive. You just cannot give free goals, and that's what we're doing too much.\"\n\nDiving into the exact struggles, the Capitals' main issues appear to stem at 5-on-5, with special teams seeing a recent boost and even providing D.C. with an early 2-0 lead against the Canucks.\n\nSince Dec. 5, Washington ranks 10th-worst in Corsi-for percentage at 5-on-5 (47.74 and has given up the third-most shots in the NHL over that span (562). Overall, at even strength, lapses in coverage have become an apparent issue, along with inconsistency through 60 minutes.\n\nIt doesn't go unnoticed, or ignored, in the Capitals' dressing room with the standings getting tighter. But as John Carlson pointed out, the team needs to translate those desired changes to the ice.\n\n\"We talk about it ad nauseam,\" John Carlson said of the team's woes. \"We address it, and there's no hiding in here. We know where our games at and what we need, what we expect from each other.\"\n\nHaving watched from up top over the previous eight games due to injury, Tom Wilson noted that Washington's struggles have nothing to do with a lack of trying, but instead, defensive breakdowns that need to be resolved before anything else.\n\n'It’s tough, you’re paying every other night. We gotta defend better, that has nothing to do with the legs or energy, we’re just giving them too many odd-man rushes, we’re giving them too many times where we lose coverage and the guy’s all alone on (our goaltender),\" Wilson said. \"I think we’re going to have to look ourselves in the mirror, defend a little bit better and then from there, we’ll worry about the offensive end once we get there.\"\n\nAs Wilson pointed out, improving from there will help the team's transition game, where Washington can then shift its focus to generating more chemistry and urgency on offense.\n\nNow that the lineup is back to full strength, there should be more consistency in the lines, which will translate to better results. But at the end of the day, it comes down to finishing and getting more on goal, one way or another.\n\n\"(There's) talking about it, and then you got to execute. I think that's the name of the game, is execution,\" Carlson explained. \"Whether it's making the right plays to get out of the zone or making the right plays in the o-zone to get a scoring chance, or when you do get a scoring chance, to bear down and score. I think we need to gather more of those key moments each game, and we got to learn pretty quick.\"\n\nThe Capitals had off Thursday as they traveled to Alberta, where they'll look to end their losing streak and get back on track in a back-to-back against the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers.",

    "description": "On the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback with Ian Begley, SNY's NBA Insider and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype discuss Karl-Anthony Towns trade rumors and potential deadline deals.",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NBA trade deadline arriving on Feb. 5, there are plenty of questions surrounding the Knicks and their NBA Finals expectations.\n\nNew York snapped their four-game losing streak in an impressive win over the Nets on Wednesday night, but the team is still in the midst of one of its worst stretches in the Jalen Brunson era. With the win, they are 3-9 over their last 12 games and have fallen into the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference -- they would be the four-seed if they didn't hold the tiebreaker over the Raptors.\n\nSo, as the Knicks look to improve the roster, what should fans be looking for? SNY NBA Insider Ian Begley spoke on the topic on the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback, where he and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype broke down what they are hearing as the trade deadline gets closer.\n\nAfter the Knicks' dreadful loss to the undermanned Mavericks at home on Monday, Newsday's Steve Popper reported that New York had spoken to a number of teams (Hornets, Grizzlies, Magic) about a potential trade involving Towns.\n\nTowns' numbers are down pretty much across the board and the big man even admitted that he's had a tough time adjusting to head coach Mike Brown's system.\n\nBegley shared on The Putback what he had heard.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations about trading Karl-Anthony Towns,\" Begley said. \"As of Monday, it was not happening. As far as something in the aftermath of that Dallas loss, no, that wasn’t the case.\"\n\nBegley added that if the Knicks go through another 2-9 stretch and continue to struggle as they get closer to the trade deadline, things might change.\n\nWhenever Towns' name is thrown out there as a trade candidate, the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is not far behind. It seems like an easy swap for both teams, but Scotto threw some cold water on the idea.\n\n“I personally never gotten the sense, at least from talking to my sources, that a team like the Milwaukee Bucks would be overly aggressive in trying to get Karl Towns in a Giannis Antetokounmpo package, theoretically,\" Scotto said.\n\nScotto suggested that the Knicks, if they were to deal Towns, would have to consider \"breaking up\" Towns' salary into multiple pieces, similar to what the Timberwolves did when they moved the big man to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations on trading Karl-Anthony Towns\"\n\nOn The Putback with @IanBegley, Ian discusses what he's heard on the KAT reports and his read on if the Knicks would make that trade pic.twitter.com/bvLAdFjzt2\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 22, 2026\n\nSince a Towns trade is unlikely, what players should we be on the lookout for?\n\nGuerschon Yabusele is as likely a candidate to be moved. According to Scotto, the acquisition was seen as a \"homerun\" by execs in the offseason, but it was made before the hiring of Brown. Clearly, Yabusele has had a tough time integrating into Brown's system, and the Knicks are looking to shop him. Scotto even suggested the Knicks may have to pair Yabusele with another minimum-salary player or draft picks to get a player that could help the team.\n\nScotto shared that the Pelicans have two players that the Knicks checked in.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were calling not only on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans but also Yves Missi,\" Scotto said. \"Part of it could be doing background, doing due diligence, but you don't make calls on these guys unless you're intersted so that raised my antenna a little bit. If you take Yabusele and another minimum guy, you could maybe try to make something happen there.\"\n\nThe Knicks' interest in Alvarado is well-documented by Missi is a name that even Begley was surprised by.\n\nMissi, 21, is a second-year center who has seen his minutes deep in year two. In his rookie campaign, Missi played around 27 minutes a game (73 games), averaging nine points, and eight rebounds (3.5 offensive). In his sophomore year, Missi is averaging 19 minutes and just 5.5 points and 5.5 rebounds (2.9 offensive) across 38 games.\n\nAcquiring another big like Missi could open up more avenues for deals involving the Knicks. Would they deal Mitchell Robinson, who is on the final year of his contract, or one of the depth bigs like Ariel Hukporti? That also opens up the possibility to trade Towns as well.\n\nThe Knicks have a lot to consider as they hope to fortify their roster for the final stretch of the regular season and the playoffs.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were not only calling on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans, but also Yves Missi\"\n\nOn today's episode of The Putback, @MikeAScotto - a must-follow for NBA fans - discusses trade deadline (link to full show in post below) pic.twitter.com/11wdozjICd\n\n— Ian Begley (@IanBegley) January 22, 2026",

He is in his second season in New York after being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves before last season.\n\nTowns' max contract is fully guaranteed through the 2027-28 season, making him a difficult player to trade.

    "fullText": "GLENDALE – The heavy favorite for the Arizona Cardinals head coaching job seems to be Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph. His ties to the franchise makes him an easy choice to understand why he will be the guy. Despite those reports and betting odds, there is still plenty of candidates vying for the opportunity.\n\nAri Meirov, who covers the NFL for the 33rd team, talked with PHNX Cardinals about other names in the running for the Cardinals job. Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur was a name that Meirov spoke about extensive about the desire to be a head coach in the NFL.\n\nJun 3, 2025; Woodland Hills, CA, USA; Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur at press conference during organized team activities at Rams Practice Facility. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\n“I have a hard time seeing Mike LaFleur not taking a job. He does a lot of work in L.A., a lot of work. He doesn’t call the plays, that’s Sean [McVay’s] job. He’s very, very important there. He learnt a lot from that experience with the [New York] Jets. Which was a difficult situation. He goes back to his buddy in Sean McVay, and it’s a whole new life for him…If you get him now, it might be bumpy at the beginning but eventually these guys will figure it out.”\n\nSep 28, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Rams cornerback Cobie Durant (14) and offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur as they get ready for the game against the Indianapolis Colts at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nWhen the Arizona job first opened, BetOnline had LaFleur as the early favorite for the job. Since then, the lines have change, but his connection with the franchise remains strong. LaFleur is in a similar boat as Joseph, as both of their teams will be competing in a conference championship game on Sunday. One would wonder, if Denver loses on Sunday and Los Angles wins or vice versa, it opens the door for either candidate to get the Cardinals job.\n\nMeirov explained LaFleur’s desire to be a head coach, and with five of the 10 NFL jobs close, his opportunity is running out. The 38-year-old will have to worry about his fellow Rams coaches from taking other opportunities. DC Chris Shula is a strong candidate for the Pittsburgh Steelers job, while Los Angeles’ passing-game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase is the top choice for the Cleveland Browns.\n\nAug 14, 2025; Carson, CA, USA; Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur reacts during a joint practice at the Dignity Health Sports Park. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nThe Cardinals could swoop in and hire LaFleur to continue expanding McVay’s impressive coaching tree. Liam Coen, Zac Taylor and Kevin O’Connell are just three former coordinators of McVay to become successful head coaches in the NFL. In a tough NFC West, Arizona could try to replicate the magic that Los Angeles has done to revive the franchise.\n\nCardinals go offensive line in Mel Kiper’s 2026 NFL mock draft",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Mariners signed an interesting - and familiar name - to a minor league deal on Thursday afternoon, coming to terms with former Texas Rangers pitcher Dane Dunning.\n\nThe 31-year-old Dunning was a first-round pick of the Washington Nationals in the 2016 MLB Draft out of the University of Florida. He was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez in 2017 for outfielder Adam Eaton and made his debut with Chicago in 2020. He made just seven appearance for Chicago before getting dealt to Texas for Lance Lynn in the offseason before the 2021 campaign.\n\nFree agent signing: Right-hander Dane Dunning has a minor league deal with the Mariners, per sources.\n\n— Chris Cotillo (@ChrisCotillo) January 22, 2026\n\nDunning went 5-10 for the rebuilding Rangers in 2021, pitching to a 4.51 ERA, and then he went 4-8 in 2022 with a 4.46 ERA in 2022.\n\nHe turned a corner in 2023, going 12-7 with a 3.70 ERA in 35 games (26 starts), helping the Rangers win the World Series over the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2024, he went just 5-7 with a 5.31 ERA and he made only 12 appearances in 2025 between the Rangers and Atlanta Braves, going 0-0 with a 6.97 ERA.\n\nThat's too Dane bad!\n\nStrikeout no. 1 for @Ddunning33! pic.twitter.com/tgNiNZeEzm\n\n— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) August 20, 2020\n\nThere's a few things that it could mean for Seattle, actually.\n\n1) The Mariners figure to have Logan Gilbert, Bryan Woo, Luis Castillo, Bryce Miller and George Kirby in the starting rotation as long as everyone is healthy. With a lot of experience, Dunning is a logical option in case someone is injured in spring training.\n\n2) The Mariners also have Emerson Hancock and Logan Evans to serve as the emergency starters in the system, but if the team decides to keep Hancock as a reliever in 2026, then Dunning likely bumps up a spot. Hancock's role will be important to watch as spring training develops.\n\n3) Perhaps Dunning could become a bullpen option for Seattle. He's made 34 relief appearances in his career.\n\nThe Mariners aren't sending any of their starting rotation to the World Baseball Classic but several top relievers are headed to their national teams, meaning there should be substantial chances for Dunning to get innings in camp, which begins Feb. 12.\n\n--The Mariners had four prospects in the Top 100 of the latest Baseball America rankings. Lazaro Montes was ranked as the No. 9 outfield prospect in the sport by MLB Pipeline.\n\n--Julio Rodriguez was named as the No. 16 player in the game on the MLB Network countdown. Cal Raleigh is in the Top 10, which is revealed on Thursday.\n\nRemember to join our MARINERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA player says dating Khloe Kardashian 'derailed' his career originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer NBA guard Rashad McCants says his brief relationship with Khloe Kardashian came at a cost he believes went far beyond tabloid attention. In his view, the timing and culture of the league during his playing days turned off-court visibility into a professional liability.\n\nMcCants, who was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2005, has said that players in his era were expected to keep a low profile unless they were established superstars. Any perceived distraction, he argues, could quickly be held against someone still trying to secure a foothold in the league.\n\nMORE: Miami fans think adult film star Abella Danger is dating Carson Beck because of a viral fake tweet\n\nSpeaking with Basketball Network’s Nick Raguz, McCants explained how celebrity relationships were viewed differently before the rise of social media and player branding. “Before, it was a distraction,” he said. “The powers didn’t want players doing anything outside of the NBA that would be considered a distraction. You didn’t see a lot of guys dating celebrities unless they were high-profile players.”\n\nAccording to McCants, that distinction mattered. Playing in a small market while dating someone already famous brought scrutiny he felt he couldn’t afford. “For me, not being a high-profile guy and being in Minnesota, it was more of a distraction than a compliment,” he said. “I was one of the early bloomers for all of those things, and it didn’t help my situation.”\n\nOn the court, McCants’ NBA run was short and uneven. Injuries and inconsistent minutes limited his opportunities, and he averaged 9.9 points per game across four seasons with the Timberwolves. As teams turned over rosters and leaned toward younger players, his role diminished, and his NBA career ended after the 2008-09 season.\n\nMORE: Klay Thompson shows up to support Megan Thee Stallion's latest Dunkin promo\n\nThe former guard also pointed to how much the league has changed since then. Today’s NBA encourages players to build brands, embrace social media, and expand their visibility, regardless of market size. In McCants’ telling, that shift highlights how different the environment was when he was trying to establish himself.",

    "fullText": "Promotion hopefuls Darmstadt and Nürnberg will lock horns, while Arminia Bielefeld host Holstein Kiel in a game between two teams separated by two divisions last season.\n\nBoth teams got off to high-scoring starts to the new year. Darmstadt threw away their lead twice in a 3-3 draw in Bochum as they missed out on climbing to second in the standings. Meanwhile, Piet Scobel’s brace helped Nürnberg to a dramatic 3-2 win over second-placed Elversberg.\n\nHowever, their last four head-to-head games have only resulted in a total of five goals. Darmstadt won the reverse fixture with the only goal of the game coming at the 94th minute from substitute Killian Corredor.\n\nFabian Nürnberger could be back straight into Darmstadt’s starting lineup against his former club Nürnberg. Miroslav Klose will not be in the dugout for the visitors after a red card in the rollercoaster win over Elversberg. Similarly, Berkay Yilmaz is suspended following his fifth yellow card of the season.\n\nDamstadt: Schuhen ©; Lopez, Pfeiffer, Maglica, Nürnberger; Klefisch, Akiyama; Richter, Marseiler; Lidberg, Hornby\n\nNürnberg: Reichert; Janisch, Gruber ©, Lochoshvili, Porstner; Markhiev; Becker, Lubach; Justvan, Zoma; Scobel\n\nBielefeld will aim for their eighth successive victory over Holstein Kiel in the other Friday evening fixture on matchday 19. However, Marcel Rapp’s side started the new year with three points at home against promotion contenders Paderborn, while Bielefeld dropped to 16th following a late defeat in Düsseldorf.\n\nAlthough there are five teams between them, Kiel are only four points ahead of their hosts after 18 matchdays. Two first-half goals saw Bielefeld win at Holstein-Stadion in the reverse fixture despite finishing the match with ten players.\n\nThere are no injury concerns for the hosts, while no changes are expected in Kiel’s starting lineup after their winning start to 2026.\n\nBielefeld: Kersken; Großer, Bauer, Felix; Momuluh, Russo, Sicker; Corboz ©; Grodowski, Telalovic, Wörl\n\nKiel: Krumrey; Nekic, Zec, Ivezic, Tolkin; Meffert; Niehoff, Skrzybski ©, Tohumcu, Therkelsen; Harres",

    "fullText": "Brian Harman was cruising around the Pete Dye Stadium Course Thursday at The American Express when the round started to unravel. The major champion was two under standing in the middle of the par-4 10th fairway and hit an approach shot to inside 10 feet.\n\nThe 39-year-old lefty was that close to what he thought would move him to three under in California.\n\nBut he discovered that he did not hit the proper ball from the middle of the fairway. He hit the ball of his amateur playing partner which was only a few feet away. Add two strokes!\n\nSo Harman then hit his approach with his original ball from 122 yards to 14 feet and two putted for a dreaded double bogey. He thought he was staring at a 3, walked off with a 6.\n\nRule 6.3c(1) says, “the player gets the general penalty (two strokes) and must correct the mistake by continuing play with the original ball by playing it as it lies or taking relief under the rules.” The stroke made with the wrong ball and any more strokes before the mistake is corrected do not count.\n\nHarman was clearly bothered by the whole circumstance and it crept into the next hole, the par-5 11th where he made another double bogey after he hit his second shot into the water, dropped, failed to hit the green then did not get up and down. Ultimately he shot one-over 73 and well down near the bottom of the leaderboard.",

This is amazing, too.\"\n\nThe Dominican fighter admits he grew up watching Lewis and is excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"I'm a person like, I'm training hard every time,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"For Derrick Lewis, when he started, I'd barely been training MMA. I followed him so much because he's a heavyweight, too, like me. He was one of my favorite fighters before until now, too, let me tell you. This Saturday, one day I was thinking, one day you will be fighting with him, and look at now. This is real, and next Saturday, Jan. 24, it will be happening. It's amazing for me.\"\n\nWith the heavyweight title picture currently unclear, that opportunity could lead to big things for Cortes-Acosta\n\n\"I want to fight at the White House,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"Latino America, everybody, we support it. More clout, so people can see one Latino fighting at the White House is amazing.\"\n\nUFC heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall is set to undergo double eye surgery after getting poked in the eye in his title fight against Ciryl Gane at UFC 321 this past October. No timeline for his return has been set, but Cortes-Acosta is ready to slide in if necessary.\n\n\"It's possible,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"I'd be available for the title shot or interim shot, interim title.

One Tar Heel in particular, though, is MVP contender Drake Maye.\n\nA quarterback who starred at North Carolina from 2021-2023, Maye is anchoring the New England Patriots' most successful season since Bill Belichick's head coaching days. Maye has his team in its first AFC Championship game since 2019, when New England won its most recent Super Bowl Title.\n\nOn Thursday, Maye earned some well-deserved recognition for his breakout campaign, earning one of the AP's five finalist nominations for NFL MVP.\n\nJoining Maye in this exclusive group are San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the last of whom is widely considered the MVP frontrunner.\n\nMaye has a golden chance to deliver his MVP-clinching moment on Sunday, with the Patriots traveling to face the Denver Broncos in a cold, 3 p.m. ET AFC Championship clash.\n\nOne step closer. 👟\n\nThe Real MVP. @DrakeMaye2 pic.twitter.com/AJSnZElrPm\n\n— Carolina Football (@UNCFootball) January 22, 2026\n\nBias aside, Maye makes an extremely strong case to win MVP in his \"Sophomore\" NFL season. Maye's 4,394 passing yards are fourth amongst quarterbacks in the regular season, his 31 passing touchdowns are third and his 77.1 QBR led the NFL.\n\nMaye also compiled 450 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns in regular season action, showcasing the same dual-threat ability he did as a Tar Heel.\n\nDespite five turnovers in the postseason, Maye is playing solid football in leading New England one win from the Super Bowl. Maye completed 33 of his first 56 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 76 rushing yards on 14 carries.\n\nIf Maye takes better care of the football on Sunday and his offensive line holds up, Maye will have no issue putting an exclamation point on his case for NFL MVP.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: Drake Maye tabbed a finalist for 2025 AP NFL MVP award",

    "fullText": "As we hit the halfway point in the NBA schedule, the Los Angeles Clippers finally seem to be salvaging their season, but that progress will be tested tonight when they host the Los Angeles Lakers at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Battle of L.A. season series sits at 1-1 heading into this matchup, and my Lakers vs. Clippers predictions expect LeBron James to be one of the swing factors.\n\nLet's dive right into my NBA picks for Thursday, January 22.\n\nLakers vs Clippers best bet: LeBron James Over 12.5 rebounds + assists (-112 bet365)\n\nLeBron James' injury issues may point to a 41-year-old in his 23rd season, but his stat lines suggest he’s got something left in the tank. James has been able to keep his sciatica and arthritis at bay while starting 2026 with a bang, so look for his fingerprints to be all over tonight’s clash with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nWith Luka Doncic doing so much of the scoring for the Los Angeles Lakers, I’m targeting LeBron’s rebounds and assists here, and he’s gone past this combo O/U number in four of his past five outings.\n\nJames has been getting the job done in both these categories so far this month, with averages of 7.7 RPG and 7.6 APG in January, and he was closing in on a triple-double in L.A.’s win over the Denver Nuggets earlier this week.\n\nUntil Austin Reaves returns, LeBron is going to have a larger share of the playmaking, particularly when Luka is on the bench, and there’s just not a lot of secondary ball-handling in the current rotation. Equally, he’s got a big role to play alongside Deandre Ayton on the boards.\n\nAt this stage of his career, James can still do the little things that drive winning, and the Lakers will need all of that veteran savvy to hold off their cross-city rivals tonight.\n\nThe Lakers are 7-3 SU in their last 10 meetings with the Clippers, and an impressive 14-8 on the road this season. With Kawhi Leonard still listed as questionable, the burden on James Harden could once again be massive, and the hosts gave up 138 points to the Chicago Bulls this week.\n\nHarden continues to put up big numbers, and I’ll take the Over on his rebounds prop here. He’s grabbed 4+ boards in six of his last seven games, and the Clippers will gladly keep him closer to the rim if it avoids the Luka defensive assignment.\n\nIvica Zubac has had some miserable possessions trying to guard Doncic on switches in the past, but the Clippers will lean on him for big minutes here. Zubac has posted three straight double-doubles, and he’s finished with 11+ rebounds in his last four games.\n\nSpread: Lakers -1.5 (+100) | Clippers +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Lakers -110 | Clippers -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 223.5 (-110) | Under 223.5 (-110)\n\nThe Lakers are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings between these teams.

    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers will enter the offseason with a new offensive coordinator after Zac Robinson was hired.\n\nThe former Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator joins the Bucs, and the wealth of weapons Baker Mayfield has at his disposal.\n\nBut Baker might have one less, depending on how the offseason goes.\n\nMike Evans is a free agent, and we aren't sure if No. 13 will continue on or retire.\n\nFor ESPN's Bill Barnwell, money will be a big factor in how this plays out.\n\n\"The player Evans' camp will try to link the star wideout to is Davante Adams, who hit free agency after a frustrating age-32 season and landed a two-year, $44 million contract with the Rams, including $26 million guaranteed at signing,\" Barnwell writes. \"Would the Bucs agree to that sort of deal?\n\n\"Evans is a franchise legend, though, and the rules can be different when those types of players are involved. It would surprising if he played somewhere else in 2026.\"\n\nMore:Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield gives NFL perfect Week 1 setup with Stefanski's Falcons\n\nIs it worth it for the Buccaneers to give Evans Davante Adams-type money? I don't think so.\n\nBut also, the franchise can't lowball one of the organization's best-ever players, either.\n\nIf Evans does want to return, maybe a one-year, $15 million deal could suffice. After all, Tampa Bay has a lot of other free agency needs as well.\n\nIt will all boil down to whether Evans wants to play. If he doesn't, all of this is moot.\n\nEither way, the Buccaneers have a decision to make on Evans, and it's one they can't get wrong.\n\nAnalyst makes incredible Hall of Fame comment on Rams' Matthew Stafford\n\nRavens don't do Lamar Jackson any favors hiring Jesse Minter as HC\n\nWill Josh Allen have input into Bills' next HC?\n\nDolphins GM's comments hint at Tua Tagovailoa uncertainty\n\nChiefs urged to sign Bills misfit after press conference horror show\n\nHow Chiefs could steal $36 million WR for Patrick Mahomes",

The reliever had a 2.95 ERA through 76.1 innings pitched, and struck out a total of 74 batters during his time at the top level.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Co-Owner Blasts Ruining Baseball Narrative\n\nThe southpaw’s ERA ranked second among Dodgers relievers with more than 20 appearances, only behind Edgardo Henriquez.\n\nDreyer has been recognized time and time again for his excellence in 2025, and had also been named as the best reliever to make his debut in 2025 by MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince.\n\nMore news: Dodgers’ Kyle Tucker Reveals Reason For New Jersey Number\n\n“Really, an impossible choice, because there are always young relievers with sick stuff who come up and dazzle from their debuts onward,” wrote Castrovince. “This season has no shortage. If we put in a limit of at least 40 innings pitched, then the Cardinals’ Matt Svanson, White Sox’s Mike Vasil, Blue Jays’ Braydon Fisher, Padres’ David Morgan, Marlins’ Cade Gibson, Rays’ Ian Seymour and Rockies’ Juan Mejia all have strong cases, with adjusted ERA+ marks well above the league average.\n\n“The 26-year-old Dreyer, though, is worthy of this particular brand of love because of the large workload (72 1/3 innings) and reliable relief work (1.05 WHIP, 2.86 ERA) he’s provided for a first-place Dodgers team that has a behemoth roster but has often been scrambling in the bullpen. Dreyer has a calmness that belies his inexperience.”\n\nMore news: What Dodgers Games Will Be on NBC Prime Time in 2026?\n\nDreyer’s dominance last season stretched into the postseason as well, with the left-hander making four appearances in the playoffs. He threw 0.2 scoreless innings against the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card round, then followed that up with a scoreless inning against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS.\n\nHe made two more appearances in the World Series, and didn’t allow a run through either of them.\n\nDreyer is sure to play a big part in a Dodgers bullpen which struggled to produce towards the end of 2025, and he will hope to have a similarly solid season in 2026 as the Dodgers look to win their third consecutive World Series title.",

    "description": "Nottingham Forest's hopes of a top-eight finish in the Europa League - and a straight route to the last 16 - are hanging by a thread after a one costly minute leads to defeat by Sporting Braga.",
    "fullText": "It was hard to see how Thursday night could have gone much worse for Nottingham Forest.\n\nAs they fell to a dour defeat in Braga, they completed the unholy trinity of scoring an own goal, missing a penalty and receiving a red card.\n\nHaving begun the evening with hopes of pushing on for a top-eight finish in the Europa League - and securing automatic qualification for the last 16 - Sean Dyche's side head home with those hopes all-but dashed.\n\nEven victory over Ferencvaros in the final round of league phase games is unlikely to be enough to spare them a two-legged play-off to reach the last 16.\n\nWhile the result was bad, the fact the travelling supporters booed their side off at both half-time and full-time tells you the performance was just as poor.\n\nThe outcome at least could all have been so different had Morgan Gibbs-White managed to convert a 53rd-minute penalty.\n\nBut the midfielder's effort was saved - and 55 seconds later, Braga were in front through a Ryan Yates own goal.\n\n\"One minute of madness in a game that we never looked in trouble,\" Dyche told TNT Sports.\n\n\"We miss a penalty - that can happen. The reaction in the next minute or so... we lose the game to a poor goal.\n\n\"They get a lift and the crowd go mad, we knock off a bit, and an unfortunate situation for Yatesy. Very frustrated.\"\n\nThat Braga managed to win the match without having a single shot on target - becoming only the second team in Europa League history to do so - will only add to Forest's frustration.\n\nBut while Braga, who did hit the post at 1-0, might not have offered a huge amount going forward, Forest were little better for much of the game.\n\nForest slump to Braga defeat with Yates own goal\n\nDyche had made seven changes from Saturday's 0-0 Premier League draw against leaders Arsenal. The last time he altered the side so drastically was at Wrexham in the FA Cup.\n\nAfter exiting the competition that night, the Forest boss was highly critical of the players who had come into the team but he more forgiving on this occasion.\n\n\"There's effort there but the cutting edge... we want more of that,\" he added.\n\n\"We are in a weird situation where I have to protect certain players. We know the Premier League is massively important but we wanted to do well in this competition and we still do.\n\n\"It's a fine line, it's a juggling act. On one hand you want to protect some players and give everyone a chance.\"\n\nYates felt that Forest were slightly hard done by to lose and that the visitors \"controlled the most part of the game\".\n\n\"We are frustrated because I think we did enough to win the game,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"We've missed an opportunity. Not that we were terrible but we can definitely do better. We have to move on quickly.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott saw it slightly differently and highlighted the added blow of Elliot Anderson's late sending off.\n\n\"The perfect way to sum it up is a mess,\" he told TNT Sports. \"Collectively it wasn't good enough.\n\n\"To top it off and lose someone of the stature of Anderson when you have a massive game next week is devastating.\n\n\"You often look at games and wonder if there are any positives. I don't think there are any tonight.\n\n\"A terrible night, terrible performance on what should have been a marvellous evening.\"\n\nAnderson will miss next week's final group game and Forest will hope the ban is not extended to include the likely play-off in February.\n\nThose extra games could be a problem for Forest at such a busy stage of the season as they chase Premier League survival - and going into them without their star midfielder would stretch the squad even further.\n\nUltimately, Forest will feel it is a situation they could have avoided.\n\n\"You might come away with a draw, but you shouldn't really lose that game,\" Dyche said.\n\nBut in \"one minute of madness\", lose it they did.\n\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Nottingham Forest - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "The three biggest questions to be answered for the Lake Show in 2026.",
    "fullText": "15 days remain until the Lake Show make their arrival in 2026.\n\nAnd it’ll be a suspenseful 15 days.\n\nAfter falling narrowly short in a Hollywood-esque adventure to a national title, Northwestern women’s lacrosse finds itself in an extremely intriguing position. Kelly Amonte Hiller has done an overhaul in the transfer portal to shore up the attack in what seems to be a “win-now” situation for NU.\n\nWith four graduate students joining the program, it seems as though the ‘Cats are going for broke this coming season: national championship or bust.\n\nKey word: national. Not just a Big Ten title, or even a Final Four appearance.\n\nNorthwestern has positioned itself to take it all, and the ’Cats Express will surely be a fun ride to jump on when it takes off from Chestnut Hill in just two weeks time.\n\nAny subway system has its major stops along the way. Each train that a passenger boards has that one robust, active, always busy stop in the middle of the city.\n\nWhat makes the ‘Cats Express so different this year is that it has three major stops along its course — stops where passengers can get a glance at where the program’s future track lines may run, and, more importantly, where this team’s final destination might be.\n\nAnd like any subway system with those major stops, these three jump off the map to anyone who boards the train.\n\nStops so recognizable that one can spot them with their eyes shut.\n\nStop number one to mark on your maps is Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nJust a few months ago, the lacrosse world had been raving about Boston College having Northwestern’s number. After defeating the ‘Cats in the 2024 national championship, and dominating them in Evanston in the No. 1 vs. No. 2 season opener last year, the Eagles seemed to have cemented themselves as superior to their midwestern foes.\n\nThat seemed to ring true through three quarter of their Final Four matchup against NU, when BC led by five with only fifteen minutes to go.\n\nWe all know how that story ended, with the Cardiac ‘Cats snatching triumph from the deepest depths of treachery in an all-time finish.\n\nHowever, NU needed one more comeback effort in the title game in order to reach the mountaintop again.\n\nAnd who denied them that storybook ending?\n\nCarolina blue haunted the ‘Cats all spring last year. Not only did the Tar Heels delegate NU to the position of national runner-up for the second straight season, but they were the only program left unconquered by Northwestern in 2025.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, the Tewaaraton award ended up going home with UNC, despite Madison Taylor having one of the greatest offensive seasons in the history of the sport. Instead, Chloe Humphrey walked the stage.\n\nInside Lacrosse projects UNC at No. 1 and Northwestern at No. 2, and looking back at the history between the two teams, that projection seems quite accurate. March 25, however, serves the ‘Cats a golden opportunity to begin to rectify last year’s shortcomings with a win over their biggest adversaries amidst the ever-intimidating, always ruthless Tar Heel Nation.\n\nSimply put, NU’s quest for its second national title of the decade will need to find a pathway around the roadblock that North Carolina presents.\n\nWhat a surprise. Stop two: Ryan Fieldhouse, where the next leader of the program will make herself felt in 2026.\n\nWith Madison Taylor and Lucy Munro heading into their final years of Northwestern lacrosse, there’s a gargantuan void that’s soon to be left for coach Hiller to fill — a hole that’s threatening to jeopardize the ‘Cats esteemed position as one of the best teams in the nation.\n\nAditi Foster seems to be the frontrunner to take the reins for NU in the near future. Her 12 goals and five assists don’t appear enticing at first glance, but the Philadelphia native was stellar in moments where Northwestern needed a spark.\n\nFoster provided a goal to give the ‘Cats some much-needed cushion in their victory over No. 6 Syracuse, netted the game winner in the finals of the Big Ten Tournament vs. Maryland, and pulled NU within two in their comeback win against BC in Gillette Stadium.\n\nDespite the influx of transfers to shore up the attack, namely Madison Epke and Olivia Adamson, it’s probable that Foster will get her share of starts in the lineup this season.\n\nAnother important piece to keep an eye on will be Taylor Lapointe, who showed her versatility against Colorado and USC last season, displaying the ability to score, find teammates at the arc, and cause chaos defensively.\n\nAnother two attackers that’ll be in the mix are Claire Marosi and Claire Ratke, whose appearances have been scarce since arriving in Evanston, but will pick up steam as time progresses.\n\nDespite the losses to the program, pending season’s end, Northwestern remains with national contender potential with the talent on their roster. What’s of most importance to the ‘Cats is a player to step up and spearhead the program for the years ahead.\n\nStop three to highlight is one that NU lax is starting to build into its own “Times Square” of sorts: a robust location that’s guaranteed to draw a crowd.\n\nNorthwestern Medicine Field at Martin Stadium. The site for the NCAA Women’s Lacrosse Final Four this year, which could provide a thrilling end to one of the most storied college careers ever.\n\nMaddy Taylor has nearly done it all at Northwestern. She’s a national champion, an All-American, a Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, a Tewaaraton finalist and the NCAA record holder for most goals in a season.\n\nThe one blemish on her resume is as such: she’s never led the ‘Cats to the mountaintop.\n\nWhen Taylor and company won it all in 2023, that company included a “who’s who” of the NCAA’s best: Izzy Scane, Erin Coykendall and Hailey Rhatigan, just to name a few. Recognizing this is not to be confused as an attempt to discredit her role as a first-year: Taylor tied for the game-high in goals in that national title game against BC, which is only a snapshot of what she did. But it’s hard to deny that the support around her was astounding, and can be categorized as one of the deepest rosters of the past decade.\n\nFast forward to 2025, when that support is long gone and Taylor is now the focal point of the offense, dominating ranked opponent after ranked opponent and having her way offensively.\n\nUntil she reached the national championship.\n\nTaylor was completely erased from the Northwestern attack, held scoreless on a measly three shot attempts. When the lights were turned up to maximum brightness, the nation’s top scorer was nowhere to be found.\n\nHer senior year is one that can be characterized as her redemption arc: her opportunity to trek back to the biggest game of the year, only this time, to exhibit her dominance when it matters most.\n\nOne final chance to lead. One final chance to triumph. One final chance to cement her legacy as a Northwestern great, while doing so on the legendary lakefront, which has seen countless moments etched in the lore of Wildcat athletics forever.\n\nWith a national championship, Taylor can join that sacred lore as one of the best to ever touch a lacrosse stick.",

Prescott is joined by Stefon Diggs, Aidan Hutchinson, Trevor Lawrence, and Christian McCaffrey, and in this particular case each of the five players are coming back from injuries sustained during the 2024 season.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this that way because Comeback Player of the Year can sometimes be a fluky award in terms of the person that wins it. The name implies that the players are coming back from something and that is often assumed to be an injury. And while that is the case for this year’s finalists the past has seen some players win the award after “coming back” from simply having a down season that had no injury as a factor.\n\nPrescott won the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year Award a few years ago and also won Offensive Rookie of the Year after his first season in the league. Perhaps he will add this one as well.",

They put the bow on their storybook run with a 27-21 win over Miami, the school their Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Fernando Mendoza, wanted to play for when he grew up a walk away from its campus.\n\nMendoza put his body on the line to score an epic fourth-quarter touchdown, and Indiana sealed its first football title with an interception that ended the Hurricanes' potential game-winning drive.\n\nIf a movie is made chronicling Indiana's turnaround from Big Ten laughingstock to college football royalty, it could be a box-office hit — that is, if the viewership numbers from Monday night's title game are any indication.\n\nBecause the thriller at Hard Rock Stadium drew 30.1 million viewers and was the second-most-watched College Football Playoff national championship game, according to ESPN PR.\n\nThe 2026 #NationalChampionship ft. @CanesFootball & @IndianaFootball delivered:\n\n📈 30.1M viewers, 33.2M peak\n🏈 2nd most-watched #CFBPlayoff title game\n📺 2nd best cable telecast ever\n🏆 Most-viewed non‑NFL sports event since '16 World Series Gm 7\n\n🔗 https://t.co/IFdlYlrxmc pic.twitter.com/rLM3Yt9iIp\n\n— ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) January 22, 2026\n\nThe CFP debuted during the 2014 season.

    "fullText": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery may not believe his team are Premier League title contenders - but he is \"dreaming\" of Europa League glory after reaching the last 16.\n\nVilla defeated Fenerbahce 1-0 in Turkey to ensure a top-eight league-phase finish with a game to spare.\n\nOn Sunday, the Spaniard warned Villa are \"not top-five contenders\" after they lost 1-0 at home to Everton.\n\nShould Villa finish outside the Premier League's top four - or top five if England is awarded an extra qualifying berth - their only hope of Champions League football next season will be through winning the Europa League.\n\nFormer Seville, Arsenal and Paris St-Germain boss Emery has won the Europa League a record four times as manager, last doing so with Villarreal in 2021, and was managing his 100th game in the competition on Thursday.\n\nHe told the media \"we have clear objectives in this competition to be a contender for a trophy\" after his side's victory in Istanbul.\n\n\"[We want] To be a contender in case we need this trophy to play in the Champions League. Through our league [it] is very difficult,\" he added.\n\n\"I am dreaming to be here getting trophies and the Europa is one objective we have this year.\"\n\nDespite being the seventh-most successful club in English football by trophies won, Villa's last piece of major silverware was the League Cup in 1996.\n\nSancho scores first Villa goal to seal last-16 spot\n\nWho can join Aston Villa in Europa League last 16?\n\nAston Villa are on a superb run of form.\n\nThey have won 20 of their past 25 matches (D1, L4) with only Arsenal (21) having won more among teams in Europe's big-five leagues during that period.\n\nTheir blip on Sunday against Everton meant they missed out on the chance to move second, within four points of Premier League leaders Arsenal - Emery's old club.\n\nHe made six changes against Fenerbahce and his side dominated, with the 1-0 scoreline flattering the 28-time Turkish champions.\n\nAfter the match Emery praised his players for \"respecting\" the competition, adding he was \"so, so happy\" with their response.\n\nVilla's match-winner Jadon Sancho scored his first goal for the club on his 19th appearance since joining on loan from Manchester United in September.\n\n\"It's nice to have a manager that backs you and obviously believes in you,\" said the 25-year-old forward who has not played for United since August 2024, and whose contract with them expires this summer.\n\n\"He [Emery] just keeps on telling me to be positive every time I play. Every opportunity I get I'm going to try and do 100% and hopefully I can deliver goals.\"\n\nSancho has only started two Premier League games this season, but in the Europa League he has been in Villa's starting line-up for each of their past five matches.\n\nVilla have played 12 times since the start of December, and by guaranteeing a top-eight league-phase finish avoided a two-legged play-off in February.\n\nEmery still played striker Ollie Watkins for the full 90 minutes on Thursday, and star midfielder Morgan Rogers for 74 minutes.\n\nHe was also able to give Tyrone Mings his first start since November, after the defender recovered from a thigh injury.\n\nAmadou Onana, who has been out with a hamstring issue, was also given a late cameo off the bench and is another key player returning.\n\n\"[We are] building the team with some circumstances not helping us,\" Emery told TNT Sports.\n\n\"But next week we can finish the transfer window and hopefully we can get everything we need to complete the squad for the next months and the competitions we have.\"\n\nLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Aston Villa - what do you want to know?",

He’s a great leader,\" Henry told The Escapist in a recent interview. \"Enjoyed my time with him in Baltimore. Kind of sad that it ended while I came to Baltimore, but I wish Coach the best. I definitely appreciate everything that he’s taught us and taught me through these last two years of me being a new guy.”\n\nHarbaugh has naturally moved on to the New York Giants to become their new head coach.\n\nHenry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner and five-time Pro Bowler, was asked how Harbaugh treats his players. His answer should delight the Giants and their fans.\n\n“He’s had a great philosophy about how he ran the organization and how he treated the players,\" Henry said. \"After we won, he would point out every single player that had an impact on the game. Even if it doesn’t get noticed nationally, he made sure that they’re appreciated throughout the organization for the effort that they put into the team.”\n\nBut, more importantly, Harbaugh will bring structure and discipline back to the Giants. After 10 double-digit losing seasons over the past 12 years, the Giants and their fans are finally getting a coach deserving of the title.\n\n\"As we begin a new chapter in New York, our focus is simple,\" Harbaugh said in his introductory press conference with th Giants this week, \"it starts with building a team that is physical and tough, that's capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end, and especially at the end, that understands how to finish, that is smart and disciplined, that plays the game the way it should be played, and that everybody watching it, including those playing it, would be proud of.\n\n\"We're going to work together. We have great and talented people to accomplish a shared mission. There will be a relentless commitment to this organization, to this city and the fans to do things the right way every single day. Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team. Thanks, Dad, for that. It'll always be about that.

That’s what they know.”\n\nAt another school in Hampshire, a longtime reception teacher says in the last few years she has noticed children getting frustrated if activities aren’t instant and seamless – something she thinks comes from playing games on a phone or tablet. There is a lack of creativity and problem-solving skills, noticeable when the children are playing with Lego or doing jigsaw puzzles and turning the pieces to fit. “I find their hand-eye coordination isn’t very good, and they find puzzles difficult. Doing a puzzle on an iPad, you just need to hold and move it on the screen. They get really frustrated and I feel like there are certain connections the brain is not making any more.”\n\nThere is also something of an attitude shift, she says – a kind of individualism that she’s convinced comes from playing alone on a device. “We are having to model to children how to be with others, how you work as a team, how you share things, because they’re so used to having their own time, doing their own thing. We’re losing a big part of being human, and if these young children don’t get all those skills, they’re not going to pick them up later on.”\n\nEarlier this month, the government announced it would be issuing new guidance on screen use for under-fives in April, after a report it commissioned found 98% of two-year-olds were watching screens on a typical day, with the average duration more than two hours. Those who spent the most time – around five hours – had limited vocabulary compared with those who spent the least, and were twice as likely to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.\n\n“It’s a trend that we’ve been seeing for quite a long time,” says Pasco Fearon, a professor of developmental psychopathology at University College London and the director of the Children of the 2020s study. “Look at studies getting all the way back to the turn of the century – you can see that screen time, on the whole, has been increasing.” That’s true for all of us, not just for children. Of the impact on children, Fearon says: “I’m sure it’s a factor that a lot of parents, like the rest of us, are on their phones. It’s becoming very dominant in everyone’s lives.” The data in this study, he says, “can be quite a useful focal point to start thinking: Wait, is this what we want? A little bit of a reset might be useful for everyone.”\n\nThis report comes on the back of other recent research showing very young children’s screen access is increasing. In October, the American research organisation Pew found that 38% of parents of under-twos said their child uses or interacts with a smartphone, and 8% of under-fives had their own smartphone. In the UK, Ofcom’s research has found that 19% of children aged three to five had their own mobile phone in 2024, and that 37% of children this age – more than 800,000 kids – were using at least one social media app, up from 29% in 2023 (though the majority use it with their parents’ supervision).\n\nThe Conservatives have just pledged to follow Australia and ban social media for under-16s, and the Labour government has said it will consider doing the same. (Australia’s ban, incidentally, includes YouTube but not YouTube Kids, which is aimed at younger viewers – so it does not necessarily address the problem of excess screen time.)\n\nUnlike for teenagers, little research has been done on the impact of social media on the youngest children. At the extreme end, all children are at risk of sexual abuse online. In November last year, the NSPCC reported online grooming crimes had reached record highs, with the youngest victim being just four.\n\nMore is becoming known about the impact of young children exposed to excessive screen time, though. In 2025, a New Zealand study found that young children who had watched more than 90 minutes a day had below-average vocabulary, communication and numeracy at the ages of four and eight, and that more screen time meant even poorer outcomes.\n\nToday Kindred Squared, an organisation that campaigns for early years education and development, releases its latest report on children’s school readiness. It found that more than half of teachers believed spending too much time on screens – by children and their parents alike – was the single biggest factor contributing to the child not being ready to start school. “We know that screen time is a problem,” says the CEO, Felicity Gillespie. This year, reception teachers reported 28% of children were unable to use a book correctly, for instance tapping or swiping the pages as if it were an electronic device.\n\n“In cases of higher usage,” says Gillespie, “there is a real negative impact on language acquisition. It’s not that surprising when you think about how language is developed in babies, that it is through that serve-and-return interaction with adults – the baby makes a noise, the parent makes a noise back. The baby smiles, the parent smiles. It’s that two-way interaction that fires the baby’s brain. Nought to two is the period when our brains are growing at their fastest rate, so the earlier you put babies in front of screens, the more they are missing out [on] those early interactions, which is where the hard-wiring of the brain is happening.”\n\nThe early years, says Gillespie, “are the foundation for everything that follows, for mental and physical health, wellbeing, your happiness, your success in relationships. I think it comes back to this need for better information for parents and clear, simple, unequivocal guidance. Tell them the truth. Tell them what the evidence says.”\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends children under two should get no screen time at all, and for those aged two to four, a maximum of one hour. Is that realistic in today’s parenting world? Gillespie acknowledges the latest study showing two-year-olds are watching two hours a day. “Then what we then need to do is give parents the information about why the WHO advises that, to inform people about the preciousness of these early years and the importance of brain development.” The government, she hopes, will “give parents the kind of practical, real-world guidance that takes account of the fact that, I think, we’ve probably missed the boat on the WHO guidance”.\n\nThe Covid pandemic accelerated screen use (many children in current reception classes and year 1 were born in that first year), but it had been steadily rising before that. “My referrals have been increasing over the past 10 years,” says Sandy Chappell, an early years speech and language therapist. During the lockdowns, she says, it was “not just that children were isolated from other children, but also that parents were relying more on screens to pacify young children. I had many parents in impossible situations, where they were trying to work from home and had babies and toddlers to entertain at the same time, so they had no choice but to rely on screens.”\n\nShe has sympathy for parents who rely on screens now. “Absolutely. It’s unbelievably difficult.” Fearon too, talking about the research that is driving the government’s advice, stresses it’s not about blaming parents. The study found children from disadvantaged families were more likely to spend time on screens. “This is about understanding the context in which this is happening, and how people are making the day work when there are challenges families are experiencing, financially, and in terms of work and all the pressures of daily life. If we’re trying to support families, it’s partly about giving them really clear advice, but also about giving more help to families, particularly those who are experiencing economic disadvantage. That’s going to give them a bit more slack to be able to play more, talk to their children more, be more engaged in the way that they’d like to.”\n\nIn Chappell’s clinic, she is seeing children with “poor attention and listening skills, poor turn-taking and social skills, as well as poor vocabulary and expressive language”. Many have their own electronic devices, and although Chappell has seen the stats about social media use, it’s not something she’s aware of. “Parents don’t tend to tell me that’s what’s happening, because I think instinctively they know it’s not a good thing.” And while some content is better than others – “things like [the BBC’s] CBeebies, where [many programmes are developed with] educational value by psychologists and educationists” – what matters more is duration. “We really need to cut the time down,” says Chappell.\n\nShe can spot the children who have spent a lot of time on screens: she has seen preschoolers, she says, who will spend seven or eight hours a day on a screen. Other children might be shy to begin with, but will soon start talking to her or will go straight to investigate her toy collection. Those who have spent a lot of time on screens, she says, don’t tend to interact with her and “don’t seem to be particularly interested in toys. They can’t follow simple instructions. They’re wandering around the room – and I’m not talking about young toddlers here, but three- and four-year-olds. They start school without even the basic skills that they need in order to be able to learn.”\n\nThis is often when the child is referred to her, with parents worrying they’re not ready for school. “Preschool children can catch up to a certain extent if the screens are reduced to a bare minimum and time is spent on building other skills. It becomes more difficult once they get to school, and we are finding that these issues are following children right through school. Their language levels at age four are one of the biggest predictors of their later academic achievement at GCSE level and beyond. So it really is important that we put the work in with children way before they go to school.”\n\nTo accommodate 60 reception children, but without space within the school, Stoke Primary turned a wooden “roundhouse” (a simple octagonal wooden structure), which had been in their forest school area, into a new classroom, complete with rugs, fairy lights and, inadvertently, no wifi – and therefore no screens. At first, as Fox wrote in TES (formerly the Times Educational Supplement), this seemed an “inconvenience” and a “hurdle”. It ended up transforming her thinking on screens in schools; her previous job had been in a school which prided itself on giving each child an iPad.\n\n“Very quickly we realised the impact that it was having on the children,” says Fox now. By the end of that first autumn term, 72% of the “roundhouse” children were considered to be “on track” compared with 44% of the children in the traditional classroom. When they switched the classes later in the year, they got similar results.\n\nThe roundhouse style, in which children sit in a circle, “forces communication and language to come before anything, which is so important. We have quite a significant amount of English as an additional language compared with other schools – 60% of our children in reception last year – so the language skills that it’s pulling out of them is remarkable.” Instead of the usual schemes, or structured lesson plans that use PowerPoint and other software, “there is none of that in the roundhouse. It forces you to go back to basics. I had to build up the confidence of those teachers to feel they could do that, and could make their own decisions about what they knew was best for their children. We all know that we live in a digital age, and there is no stopping digital growth. But to what extent are we using tech to replace the things that we know are best for our children?” Both reception classes no longer use screens for teaching, though the older classes do.\n\nFox is turning her attention to the newest generation of teachers coming through. “They’re from a different generation,” she says – people who have grown up with screens themselves. “How can we give them the confidence to know what’s best, and to put the scheme down and just connect with their children?”",

    "title": "Why medieval city-builder video games are historically inaccurate (2020)",
    "description": "This blog post explores the historical accuracy of medieval city-builder video games.",
    "fullText": "May 01, 2020 \n\n • \n Socio-Economic History\n and Medievalism\n\n • \n\nThis blog post explores the historical accuracy of medieval city-builder video games.\n\nSince many of us are working from home in these trying times, it seems safe to assume that more people than ever are indulging in playing the occasional computer game. A city builder is a specific kind of computer game in which you design a city, extract resources, set up production chains and ensure that your settlement grows. City builders are very similar to strategy games as they reward patience and strategy. In this article, I will take a look at one sub-genre of the city builder, the medieval city builder, and explain how this gaming genre relates to our knowledge of medieval settlement planning.\n\nThe city builder has its origins far back in the 1990s in the combination of the strategy genre and the management genre, leading to games such as Sim City (1989), Caesar (1992) and Age of Empires (1997).\n\nIt did not take long before medieval-themed city builders popped up. We may think of Settlers (1993) and Knights and Merchants (1998). In addition, the Anno games (1998-2019), although initially set in the 1600s basically had a medieval theme.\n\nThese games often start with plopping down a village center on a promising location near abundant resources. You then continue to gather these resources which grant you building materials for building new homes and facilities for your settlement.\n\nSetting up specialized production chains might involve growing grain, milling the grain for flour and turning the flour into bread which feeds your villages. Similarly, another production chain might involve rearing sheep for their wool, turning the wool into cloth and turning the cloth into clothing. When done correctly, the reward of correct investments and planning is that you see your settlement grow.\n\nThis often leads to settlements growing organically from a couple of houses around a community center to a larger settlement with hundreds of people. However logical such an organic growth of a settlement might seem, it is not historically accurate.\n\nAny gameplay loop that tells a story of linear settlement growth is incongruent with how a medieval economy worked (see Foussier 2004). Medieval villagers were often living on the edge of subsistence. Agricultural surpluses were skimmed by the church and the feudal lords. Bad harvests, banditry, warfare and disease might decimate a village community at any time. For this very reason, the demography of many European villages remained relatively stable between the twelfth and the eighteenth century. It may therefore be clear that the gameplay loop of city builders pivots around the concept of doing the historically exceptional (i.e. growing a settlement to a town) and thereby strays far from what actually happened in the lives of our medieval forebears. \n\nA notable exception to this genre trope is the game Banished (2014) in which high mortality rates and bad weather do seriously stifle any kind of linear growth. In this city builder you are constantly fighting the odds and settlement growth is not guaranteed. However, also in Banished it is your goal to overcome the stagnation and lead your settlement to expansion.\n\nA thing that is rarely touched upon in medieval city builders is how complex village life actually was. This can be exemplified by how the community related to its overlords. Land ownership here is key. Land in the community might be owned by a lord, a local liegeman, a monastery or even directly by the duke or count. Taxes, rents and tithes were the organisational structures in which the landowner was tied to the farmers who worked the fields. Often the payment of taxes and tithes was linked to feast days and the visit of the tax collector represented a big event in the agricultural year. An interesting side note is that some obligations which the commoners had to the lord and the church (such as seigneurial duties like working a mill) might drain the community from the needed manpower for tilling the land. Furthermore, a rural community that was its own seigneury had access to a law court with sheriff, aldermen and a local militia (Middle Dutch schutterie) to fight off bandits with. Harsh capital punishments were set in place to deter anyone from raiding the farms and hamlets and the village gallows were often the first thing one saw when approaching a medieval settlement.\n\nBut something that is much more fundamental to the theme of a settlement building game, is how medieval settlements were actually planned and grew. Landscape historians and archaeologists have acquired a lot of insight into how this worked.\n\nLet's start with the realization that medieval settlements in their first stages of development were planned and laid out according to a specific design. In my own research into the settlement history of West-Brabant (southern Netherlands, from 1000 to 1300 CE) I have encountered the following types.\n\nHere is a sketch of a Brabantine circular manor (Middle Dutch vroonhoeve). This is a reinforced circular homestead with moat, often next to a bend in the river, containing several farms and a fan-like plot pattern radiating out from it. Such manors were often called BORCH.\n\nHere is a sketch of a Brabantine street settlement, often built with exploitation of nearby fenland in mind. It consists of a line of farms with associated evenly sized rectangular plots built in a line perpendicular to a raised road.\n\nHere is a more complex exploitation village which is set up with a moated enclosed church homestead and a central meadow as its center. There is a line of farms next to the road. The arable land to the east is bordered by a ditch supplying fresh drinking water (Middle Dutch bansloot). In layout, this type represents a hybrid between the two earlier settlement types.\n\nLet us first make clear that these different types of exploitation settlements often existed alongside each other and can be found in one and the same region. In part, the different types reflect different chronological layers but some types were also more suited to certain geographical environments than others.\n\nSo how were these settlements planned? Many medieval exploitation enterprises were initiated by a monastery or a consortium of free men who were granted permission by (or bought permission from) the feudal lord to “colonize” the wilderness.\n\nClearing the wooded landscape in order to create arable land was done by cutting away the trees and bushes (Middle Dutch rode) or, alternatively, burning it away in controlled fires (Middle Dutch brant).\n\nLand surveyors sent by the lord would then measure out the block or strips that would be taken in cultivation. Strips of arable land were often 1250m deep (6 Middle Dutch voorlingen = furlongs) so that the plough could go straight in a long line before having to turn. Important blocks or strips were demarcated by hedges, earthwork, woodwork, ditches or roads. Medieval names for these blocks often survived into the modern day.\n\nThe presence of drinking water (a river or a brook) in the vicinity was an important factor in choosing the location for the settlement. The vicinity of water entailed risk and reward because flooding was an ever present danger. Floods could devastate arable land but might also fertilize it. Meadows in particular were often situated in flood areas.\n\nSo how was such a settlement managed? First of all, the quality of the soil had to be carefully controlled by crop rotation: specific crops were sown on different segments of the arable land with one part laying fallow to recover from the tilling (English three-field system, Dutch drieslagstelsel). The cattle and sheep were put out to pasture on the common meadows guarded by a shepherd or cowherd. Pigs were allowed to forage in the nearby forests and killed in autumn before the winter starvation set in.\n\nRoads and rivers were important for transport of crops and livestock. These roads, some of them paved, some of them not, needed to be maintained. They were essential to the payment of the tithe, since tithe collectors assessed the harvest on the field and later collected the sheaves on the side of the road.\n\nThe buildings within the community also needed maintenance. Farmhouses, community barns and stables were made of wood and had to be rebuilt every few generations, only the name of the farm or homestead being continued.\n\nSo what kind of threats did a medieval settlement face? First of all, the weather was an important factor which dictated the success of the harvest. Storms, droughts and floods could devastate the harvest and decimate the community.\n\nDiseases and epidemics were another danger threatening the community. The situation on the countryside was a lot better in this regard than in the medieval towns, but an epidemic could still mean the end of a village. Similarly, diseases among livestock impacted the medieval subsistence economy in a brutal way.\n\nThen there are the consequences of medieval warfare affecting the community: Armies that passed by could plunder the village, burn the farms and execute villagers at will. Or they could also demand supplies, food and provisions as an emergency \"tax\"\n\nBut war also brought indirect consequences; a liege lord calling the banners and levying troops from the village community might extract a large part of the adult men. Warfare also disrupted the trade networks that supplied a village with building materials and commodities.\n\nThen there were internal threats to the fabric of the village community. We may think of social unrest because of land disputes. Feuds could also tear a community apart with endemic vendetta’s causing death and despair. A socially unstable society was also more prone to internal accusations of heresy and witchcraft.\n\nSo, which of the above listed features could potentially contribute to a more historically accurate computer game about medieval settlement building? First of all, it would be more realistic if the settlement could first be planned out and was not forced to \"grow organically\" from a community center. The first settlement phase would be a test of how “successful” a layout is in adapting to the exigencies of the terrain and the needs of the community. Only after that initial layout proved successful, further expansions can be planned.\n\nSecondly, it would be more realistic if we could build both straight roads and curved roads, just as in Cities Skylines (2015), a modern city builder well known for its incredibly flexible layout tools. Incidentally, the tools of Cities Skylines can also be used to recreate medieval settlements, as was done by YouTube creator Play Curiously who constructed an impression of a medieval Croatian village.\n\nSuch a flexible road drawing tool can then also be used to lay out ditches, hedges and enclosures since these features were central to the medieval experience of the cultivated landscape.\n\nThirdly, It would be interesting to see a medieval-themed game embrace the concept of flood valleys that limit and endanger pasture and arable land. Other historical city builders such as Pharaoh (1999) and Children of the Nile (2004) already implemented this feature for their setting in Ancient Egypt. However, such a mechanic would likewise fit a medieval city builder and show the general public how medieval society dealt with seasonal flooding as well as the devastating effects that storm floods could have.\n\nAnd finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.\n\nThere are some good reasons why city building games are not that historically accurate and instead adhere to the established formula of the city building game.\n\nFirst of all, a linear growth model makes sense from a gameplay perspective, since it is rewarding to see your settlement grow.in a linear way. It fosters a feeling of progress and motivates the player to keep momentum and push through to the next expansion phase. Secondly, games are generally wary of punishing failure too harshly in order to avoid demoralizing the player. Thirdly, in order to facilitate path finding for the simulated villagers it is easier to implement a gridlike road and building system rather than an off-grid building system that allows for curvy roads. So far only Cities Skylines has managed to do this in a satisfactory way.\n\nLastly, for marketing purposes and recognizability, game developers generally don't stray too far from the image of the Middle Ages that the public is already acquainted with. For a medieval city builder this means windmills, industrious peasants, lots of sheep and stone castles. Things like land surveying, crop rotation and tithe collection do not fit this image and challenge the romanticized picture of the uneducated farmer in his pre-industrial environment.\n\nAlthough I think medieval-themed city building games could benefit from incorporating some of the things we know about medieval settlement history into the gameplay loop, it may not be desirable for game developers to stray too far from the established formula. The idea that medieval settlements developed organically according to messy road plans is strongly imbedded in popular perception. Allowing both straight and curved road building in medieval city builders, may serve to challenge some of the stereotypes that exist about medieval village life. And if you ask me, that would be a good thing for it is an enriching experience to see the world through the eyes of our medieval forebears. One may find out that their lives were not that different after all...",

    "fullText": "Humanoid robots can do kung-fu and parkour. But can they make your morning coffee?\n\nAt a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale.\n\nJake Loosararian, the CEO of infrastructure startup Gecko Robotics, said that deploying robots into real-world environments was the major challenge facing the much-hyped industry.\n\n\"Deployment is the big problem right now for robotics, in terms of the ability for it to begin to make really large impacts, and for there to be a clear road map,\" said Loosararian.\n\nThe cofounder of the Pittsburgh-based company said that building reliable sources of data about the environments in which humanoid robots were operating would be critical for startups looking to move beyond flashy demos to real-world returns.\n\n\"You have to forward deploy and build your robots as close to the environment as possible. And that gives you the information and dataset that doesn't exist anywhere on the internet, anywhere on YouTube, about what these environments are like,\" Loosararian added.\n\nDaniela Rus, the director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said there was a gap between robots' ability to perform tasks in a laboratory and their ability to take on jobs traditionally done by humans in the real world.\n\n\"I can give you a robot that will fold your laundry and load your dishwasher, but it might cost you half a billion dollars,\" she said.\n\nRus said bridging that gap would require advancements in a humanoid robot's ability to perceive and manipulate the world through improved sensors and new AI models that can handle situations the robot may not have encountered before.\n\nShao Tianlan, the CEO of Chinese AI and robotics firm Mech-Mind, said that one big barrier to making humanoid robots useful in a factory environment was developing the capacity for them to learn directly from their human coworkers.\n\n\"If we want to deploy a robot, I would say demonstration is the most intuitive way to tell robots what to do. That's exactly how we humans teach others,\" he said.\n\nTianlan, who said that Mech-Mind had delivered more than 10,000 \"intelligent robots\" over the last 12 months, added that he did not believe humanoid robots needed \"Einstein-level\" intelligence to perform useful tasks, however.\n\nHe predicted that robots would take on some jobs performed by humans in controlled environments, such as in logistics and some service industries, in the next \"few hundred days.\"\n\nHumanoid robots are riding a wave of hype as companies like Tesla and Figure prepare to begin large-scale manufacturing of their machines. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made bold predictions about the company's Optimus robot, saying it could eliminate poverty and be the biggest product of all time.\n\nHowever, most humanoid robots have not yet been deployed in real-world environments. Many humanoid robot demos are staged in tightly controlled settings, and some use teleoperation, where human operators pilot the robots remotely.\n\nLoosararian called teleoperation the \"dirty little secret\" of robotics, adding that robotics companies had a responsibility to inform customers about whether their humanoid robots are operating autonomously or with human assistance.\n\n\"There's a lot of autonomy for certain tasks, but for the majority of the cases, for humanoids, it's learning in the environment, and it has to do that with teleoperation,\" Loosararian said.",

Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

    "title": "TikTok Strikes Deal for New U.S. Entity, Ending Long Legal Saga",
    "description": "The Chinese parent company for the popular video app said it had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new American TikTok to avoid a ban in the United States.",
    "fullText": "TikTok said on Thursday that its Chinese owner, ByteDance, had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new U.S. TikTok, concluding a six-year legal saga that saw the app banned by Congress, ensnared in politicking between global superpowers and forced into a 14-hour blackout in the United States.\n\nInvestors including the software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm will own more than 80 percent of the new venture. That list also includes the personal investment entity for Michael Dell, the tech billionaire behind Dell Technologies, and other firms, TikTok said. Adam Presser, TikTok’s former operations head, will be the chief executive for the U.S. TikTok.\n\nThe deal is intended to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States.The changes enable “our U.S. users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience,” said Shou Chew, TikTok’s chief executive, in an internal memo that called the move “great news.”\n\nThe agreement, which was hammered out over more than a year, resolves existential questions about TikTok’s future. The app — with its unceasing feed of lip syncs, political endorsements, conspiracy theories and skin care tutorials — would have had to leave the American market if it did not separate from ByteDance.\n\nIt was also the end of a legal odyssey. Since 2019, universities, several branches of the U.S. military, the vast majority of the House of Representatives and both President Trump and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have tried to ban or block TikTok, with unanimous support from the Supreme Court. Influencers, mobilized by the app, lobbied politicians and mounted protests to save their feeds and follower counts. TikTok became embroiled in a trade war between the United States and China, as the nations engaged in a heated contest over technology and industrial supremacy.\n\nBut the drama dragged on for so long and with so little consequence that even some who once fought to save the app had stopped worrying about it.\n\nNaomi Hearts, a 28-year-old content creator in Los Angeles who twice traveled to Washington as part of TikTok’s lobbying efforts, said she felt “detached” from the platform after years of upheaval.\n\n“I feel like it’s going to be another day,” Ms. Hearts said in an interview this week, anticipating the deal’s completion.\n\nIt was unclear how much, if anything, the deal would change for TikTok’s users in the United States. Since the outlines of the deal were released months ago, users have raised concerns about whether the new owners will overhaul the algorithm that personalizes their feeds. And experts have cautioned that the arrangement might fail to address the national security concerns that motivated the deal in the first place.\n\nThe driving force behind the deal is a federal law, passed in 2024 and upheld by the Supreme Court, that would have banned the app if it did not separate itself from ByteDance by early 2025. The app even went dark for 14 hours as the law’s deadline approached, sending some users into a tailspin. But Mr. Trump formally delayed the enforcement of the law several times after he took office again, as he pushed the company to reach a deal for new ownership.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15 percent of TikTok’s U.S. operations. ByteDance will own just under 20 percent.\n\nThe other investors include Mr. Dell’s office and a long list of investment firms, including affiliates of General Atlantic and Susquehanna, both of which had previously invested in ByteDance.\n\nThe majority of the seven-member board for the new U.S. TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees. Mr. Chew has a seat on the board.\n\nThe new venture will moderate content in TikTok’s feed, deciding which posts to leave up and which to take down. It’s unclear what the value of the American version of TikTok will be. Vice President JD Vance said in September that a U.S. TikTok company would be valued at $14 billion. ByteDance, by contrast, has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets.\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order in September that gave formal approval to the arrangement, a move required under the 2024 law.\n\nThe Chinese government has not publicly commented on TikTok’s announcement. For years, Beijing had been a major obstacle to finalizing a deal. When the United States first pushed to force a sale of TikTok, China amended its export control list to include technologies like algorithms and source codes, giving it the power to weigh in on any deal involving the app.\n\nLast year, Trump officials said they had won Beijing’s support for a deal. China’s statements were more vague.\n\nSeveral of the new investors have ties to Mr. Trump, raising concerns for some TikTok users that the app could start showing more content aligned with the president’s views or the positions of the U.S. government.\n\nLarry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire founder, has a close relationship with Mr. Trump, and lobbied the president directly on behalf of his son David Ellison’s bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. MGX has done business with the Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.\n\nAnupam Chander, a law and technology professor at Georgetown University, said that the deal allows for “more theoretical room for one side’s views to get a greater airing.”\n\n“My worry all along is that we may have traded fears of foreign propaganda for the reality of domestic propaganda,” he added.\n\nThere are also lingering concerns that ByteDance will still influence the app’s content. In addition to its stake, ByteDance will keep TikTok’s coveted algorithm, which it will license to the new U.S. entity.\n\nThat arrangement may fall short of the 2024 law, which required the sale to end any “operational relationship” between ByteDance and TikTok in the United States, critics said.\n\n“They may have saved TikTok,” said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Hudson Institute. “But the national security concerns are still going to continue.”\n\nThursday’s announcement is something of a mash up of two earlier proposals aimed at distancing TikTok from ByteDance.\n\nThe app’s troubles in the United States started almost at the same time as its stratospheric rise in popularity. It accelerated during the Covid pandemic, as the housebound masses turned to their phones to distract themselves with dance trends and memes.\n\nSoon after, Congress and the first Trump administration grew increasingly anxious that under Chinese law, ByteDance could be forced to provide personal information about Americans to Beijing’s military and intelligence apparatus.\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Trump threatened to ban TikTok. He then unsuccessfully tried to force ByteDance to sell the app to a consortium that included Oracle and Walmart.\n\nTikTok spent years pushing an alternative to a sale. Under that proposal, which the company called Project Texas, Oracle would oversee the app’s American user data on servers in the United States. ByteDance would still produce the app’s code, but its work would be audited by Oracle.\n\nSix years later, negotiators have settled on a consortium arrangement. Oracle is still a major player, and ByteDance is still involved, too.\n\n“We’ve gone round and round and ended up not too far from where we started,” said Lindsay Gorman, a former senior adviser in the Biden administration.\n\nMadison Malone Kircher contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says he thinks aging will one day be solved.\n\nThe world's richest man said getting older was a \"very solvable problem\" during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.\n\n\"When we figure out what causes aging, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious. It's not a subtle thing,\" Musk said. \"The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body,\"\n\nBut Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives.\n\n\"You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place,\" he said. \"It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely.\"\n\nMusk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called \"boring af.\" His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information.\n\nDozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" one resident said.\n\nTrump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign.\n\nThe weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning.",

    "description": "An oil shock, disruptions from China, and NATO conflicts are among BCA's list of unlikely but plausible events that would slam markets in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices soaring, the world economy falling into a recession, and the NATO alliance dissolving top the list of one research firm's possible black swan events in 2026.\n\nAnalysts at BCA Research listed five unlikely but plausible scenarios that could derail markets in 2026. In a note to clients, the firm said its annual list of potential black swans was slightly different this year and addressed only \"the most important\" risks, given that there are several black swan threats investors are discussing \"ad nauseam.\"\n\n\"It is a sign of the times that white swans are now in the minority,\" a team led by Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at the firm, wrote.\n\nHere's what the firm thinks are the five biggest outlier threats facing markets this year:\n\nOil prices could spiral if the Iranian government collapses. It is a possible event that would jeopardize a significant portion of the world's oil supply, and the inflationary impact of that shock could send the world economy into a recession, the firm speculated.\n\nBCA pointed to recent geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran and estimated there is a roughly 38% chance of a \"massive\" oil supply shock stemming from upheavals in the country. The estimated probability of a \"minor\" oil supply shock is 40%.\n\nA geopolitical shock in the Middle East usually causes crude prices to rise 3% over a month and 10% over three months, according to a historical analysis from BCA.\n\n\"But a real Iran shock would be much bigger than average,\" the firm wrote.\n\nThe strategists acknowledged that President Donald Trump is seeking to avoid an oil supply shock amid pressure from the coming midterm elections. Iran is also incentivized to \"leave oil alone\" in order to avoid attacks from other nations, which should prevent a shock, they said.\n\nThe world's inventory of oil also remains \"substantial\" at around 8 billion barrels, according to estimates from BCA's commodities and energy team.\n\nThe stock market could be in for another bout of turmoil similar to last year's stunning reveal of China's lower-cost AI model if the country pulls ahead of the US in the tech arms race.\n\nChina already spends more on research and development compared to the European Union. Patent applications in the nation also outpace applications in the US, Europe, South Korea, and Japan, BCA said, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nA technological breakthrough in Beijing could hit stock prices elsewhere around the world, BCA said. The firm pointed to the DeepSeek-fueled sell-off that erased $1 trillion $1 trillion from US stocks last year.\n\n\"This episode could happen again,\" BCA wrote.\n\nShould China make more progress on the AI front, OpenAI, ChatGPT's parent, could see its valuation \"evaporate,\" the firm said.\n\nStrategists later added that they saw a 50% chance of the tech bubble bursting this year.\n\nChina could become economically self-sufficient, removing a key constraint that prevents the country from escalating military conflict related to Taiwan, BCA suggested.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 39% probability that tensions between China and Taiwan would escalate this year. They also saw a 25% probability that tensions could break out in a proxy war, and a 7% probability that tensions could break out into a major war.\n\n\"What if China reaches technological self-sufficiency so that it can pursue a maximalist policy abroad?\" strategists wrote. \"If China falls deeper into demographic decline, debt-deflation, and dictatorship, then its powers have already peaked and its best chance for creating a sphere of influence is now.\"\n\nChina's economic statistics, like its industrial production, suggest that the nation is not preparing for war at the moment, the firm noted.\n\n\"It is not flashing red, at least not yet,\" the firm said of risk factors that could lead to military conflict.\n\nRussia could seize territory from a NATO member, sparking military conflict between Russia and the alliance. In the worst-case scenario, Russia could make nuclear threats against NATO, and the US may need to step in to \"restore the 'balance of terror,'\" strategists speculated.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 10% probability of a Russia-NATO war.\n\n\"Russia is currently engaged in a campaign to sabotage Europe's critical infrastructure. The US's lack of solidarity with the allies could encourage overreach. Russia could take its provocations too far,\" the BCA wrote.\n\nWhile the firm said it expects Russia to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine this year, it also pointed to the risk that Trump could provide Ukraine with new military support and funding, which could lead Moscow to become more aggressive in its war with Kyiv.\n\n\"Russia, endangered by the new demands of a longer war against a superior opponent, and having missed the chance to negotiate a favorable ceasefire, could become desperate and even more dangerous,\" the firm added.\n\nShould Russia attack another NATO nation and the US doesn't come to their defense, the alliance would become a \"dead letter,\" BCA said.\n\nAlternatively, the US could also invade Greenland and cause the alliance to dissolve, the firm said, though Trump ruled out using military force to acquire the territory.\n\nBCA said it doubted either scenario would occur, but pegged a 30% probability that the US could harm NATO in some way.\n\n\"The president is determined to seize Greenland at any cost, and to insist on the full extent of his constitutional power as executive and commander-in-chief, then obviously he could conquer Greenland, to hell with the consequences,\" strategists wrote.",

    "description": "Paramount is giving more power to a streaming data and insights executive as part of David Ellison's plan to make Paramount into a tech-first company.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is showing that his tech-first vision for Paramount Skydance isn't just talk.\n\nEllison is taking his data-focused strategy to a new level by elevating Jason Kim, Paramount's EVP of data and insights, to oversee data for the entire company, instead of just the direct-to-consumer division.\n\nThe change was announced by Domenic DiMeglio — who heads up marketing as well as data and insights for Paramount's streaming division — in a Thursday afternoon staff meeting, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\nKim's increased remit comes a day after Ellison, Paramount's CEO, met with company leadership in its New York offices.\n\n\"It's a wonderful opportunity for Jason — and for the team overall — to start playing a bigger role for what's happening at Paramount as we move forward,\" DiMeglio said in the meeting.\n\nDiMeglio added that Kim's bigger role is part of \"David's vision of trying to transform ourselves into being a tech-first media company — and, really, the most tech-forward media company in this space.\"\n\nEllison has remade Paramount in other ways since taking control of the company in August, including securing US UFC rights, hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News, and attempting to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhile Paramount already had data and analytics teams across the company, it now has a new point person to oversee those efforts.\n\n\"I would hope and expect that, little by little, we're going to bring those silos down,\" DiMeglio said. He added it's \"not easy work.\"\n\nDane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, said in an email to employees that \"these updates are part of a broader effort to focus our investments, reduce fragmentation, and move faster as one team.\"\n\nParamount's streaming team has become familiar with change. Last week, Paramount's streaming product and tech chief, Vibol Hou, told colleagues he was leaving at the end of January, Business Insider reported.\n\n\"You could probably sense that there's been some musical chairs stuff going on within the organization at large,\" Kim said. \"And that's not unique. That's sort of true of any company that's undergoing a large-scale organizational transformation, like the one that we're in the midst of now.\"\n\nContinuing the musical chairs analogy, Kim said that this change signals that \"this is our chair — we're here to stay.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount laid off about 1,000 employees in October, a few months after its Skydance merger closed, Kim downplayed the idea that this data and insights shake-up signals that more cuts are ahead.\n\n\"I don't think our scope is going to get smaller here. It is only going to get larger,\" Kim said. \"And I think those are all exciting tailwinds for us as a team.\"\n\nKim added that \"there might be more consolidation in the future, but that's going to be into our team.\"\n\nTwo Paramount employees in the meeting told Business Insider they were happy to hear about the change.\n\n\"It is exciting, given that we will have a lot more visibility than we used to,\" one employee on this team said.\n\nAnother staffer said this change indicates that Paramount is \"somewhat serious about the 'tech'-ification of the company.\"",

    "description": "A local news site compiled a list of over 200 businesses that have said they'll join an economic blackout day to protest ICE presence in Minnesota.",
    "fullText": "On Friday, Vanessa Beardsley is inviting her community to come hang out with cats and drink coffee at her Minnesota business, Catzen Coffee — but they won't be able to spend any money.\n\nCatzen is participating in a January 23rd economic shutdown, in which activists are calling on Minnesotans to close their businesses, not report to work or school, and refrain from shopping in protest of ICE's presence in the state.\n\nBeardsley said she \"immediately\" knew she wanted to \"stand in solidarity with our fellow businesses and our state,\" but didn't want to completely close her doors. \"We are not doing business,\" she said, \"but we will be open for people who just need a space to come and hang out.\"\n\nIt's unclear how widespread participation in the blackout will be or what impact it may have on ICE operations. Local news site Bring Me The News has compiled a running list of more than 200 businesses that have posted on social media that they will be participating. The shutdown, prompted by ICE officer Jonathan Ross's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, has been endorsed by a slew of regional labor unions, whose demands include ICE leaving the state and no additional federal funding for the agency.\n\n\"Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families,\" Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said in a statement. \"Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.\"\n\nICE didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration's immigration operations \"have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets.\"\n\n\"Making American communities safer will create an environment in which all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"ICE gets beat up by stupid people, from leadership in Minnesota,\" Donald Trump said in a speech at Davos this week. \"We actually are helping Minnesota so much, but they don't appreciate it. Most places do.\"\n\nIn addition to the larger shutdown, there's a march set to run through downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. CT. The state is expected to be under extreme cold warnings and extreme cold watch throughout the day on Friday, which might also keep Minnesotans home. Some local businesses are also opting to stay open, but planning to donate a share of — or all — of their profits to related causes.\n\n\"I understand why people are choosing to participate in the January 23 blackout, and I support those decisions,\" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement to Business Insider. \"At the same time, our small businesses, especially immigrant-owned businesses, are under a lot of pressure right now, and they could really use our support. However you choose to show up, I hope we keep our neighbors and local businesses in mind.\"",

    "fullText": "Preparations are underway as over half of all US states brace for what could be a historic winter storm this weekend.\n\nAcross the country, Americans are stocking up on essentials and picking store shelves clean as they brace for Winter Storm Fern, which is expected to span from the South and Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast and Midwest, starting Friday morning.\n\nLocal authorities have begun salting roads and establishing emergency protocols in anticipation of potential power outages and limited travel.\n\nExperts and authorities are advising people in affected states to stock up on food items that don't need to be cooked or refrigerated, and to have at least one gallon of water per person or pet per day. They are also recommending that people charge all electronic communication devices in case of power outages. They're warning to watch out for pipes bursting, snow blocking exhaust vents, and iced-over roads.\n\nThe Weather Channel predicted Thursday that wintry conditions, including ice, snow, and dangerous wind chills, could affect up to 230 million people — or two-thirds of the country's population — across the US.\n\nThe Midwest will experience the coldest temperatures as a polar vortex dips south, with lows possibly reaching -50 degrees Fahrenheit in states like North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, the Associated Press reported Thursday.\n\nThe Appalachians and the Northeast Corridor could see the most snow accumulation, with the mountains of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia expected to receive at least a foot of snow over the weekend.\n\nFrom Texas to the Carolinas, the South and Southeast can expect ice accumulation on roads and power lines. Local authorities are warning of potential multi-day power outages in the region.\n\nSee how Americans are preparing for what could be a historic storm, from stocking up on necessities to salting roads.",

    "title": "10 celebrities who left the US or are considering moving for political reasons",
    "description": "Celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres, Rosie O'Donnell, and James Cameron are among the stars who have left America and moved elsewhere due to politics.",
    "fullText": "The lifestyles of the rich and famous often include mansions in California, penthouses in the big city, and maybe a small pied-à-terre in a foreign country. But as politics becomes an increasingly divisive topic in the United States, some more celebrities are moving out of the country — or saying that they will.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi moved to England from California in response to the 2024 election results. Rosie O'Donnell — thanks to her Irish grandparents — is in the process of becoming an Irish citizen, citing the current US political climate as her reason for moving in a TikTok video. Other celebrities like Laverne Cox and Cher have vowed to leave the States but haven't yet.\n\nThis isn't exactly a new trend. During the 2016 US presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, many stars vocally opposed Trump and threatened to leave America if he won. Now, with Trump's second term underway, celebrities are again considering relocating — not that the Trump administration is too upset.\n\n\"Good riddance!\" White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers told BI when asked for the administration's response.\n\nCelebrities aren't the only ones exploring a new place to live. Search interest for \"move abroad\" shows that peak interest occurred in November 2024. Though interest has since cooled off, it's still higher than in previous years.\n\nBureaucracy.es, an immigration services site that helps Americans moving to Spain with the visa application process, told CNN in December 2024 that it's seen over 300% more clients book consultations since the November election.\n\nHere are 10 celebrities who have moved abroad, or say they will for political reasons.\n\nOlivia Singh contributed to previous versions of this post.\n\nIn late November 2024, TheWrap reported that comedian Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, left their Montecito home for the Cotswolds, England. The publication said their move to the countryside was triggered by Trump's election and a source said they're \"never coming back.\"\n\nAn August 2025 Us cover story notes that DeGeneres told English broadcaster and host Richard Bacon during a July 20 event that she and DeGeneres were in the Cotswolds when the election results came in. \"We were like, 'We're staying here. We're not going back,'\" DeGeneres told Bacon on their reaction to Trump's victory.\n\nAccording to the Us story, DeGeneres and de Rossi have since moved from the original home they purchased in the Cotswolds and now live in a 10,000-square-foot country home called Hiaven. The pair tend to their chickens, sheep, and horses and walk to the local pub for lunch.\n\nIn a video recently posted on TikTok, Rosie O'Donnell confirmed that she moved from the US to Ireland with her youngest daughter, Dakota. The actor relocated on January 15, days before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"Although I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, that's what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child,\" O'Donnell said in the video.\n\nThe talk show host, who has Irish grandparents, said her experience so far has been \"pretty wonderful\" and she's in the process of getting Irish citizenship.\n\nO'Donnell said that she misses her four other kids and her friends, but will remain in Ireland for the time being.\n\n\"I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country,\" she said. \"And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that's when we will consider coming back.\"\n\nUK-born actor Sophie Turner moved to America after marrying singer Joe Jonas. The couple first lived together in Los Angeles and later in Miami with their two daughters Willa and Delphine. Turner and Jonas sold their Miami home in August 2023 and news of their plans to divorce broke weeks later.\n\nIn an interview with Harper's Bazaar published in October 2024, Turner said that she was homesick while living in the US and struggled with the country's politics. Turner has since moved to West London.\n\n\"The gun violence, Roe v Wade being overturned... Everything just kind of piled on,\" Turner said.\n\nAfter the 2022 Uvalde shooting, in which 19 elementary school children and two teachers were killed, Turner said she \"knew it was time\" to leave.\n\nIt was no secret that Barbra Streisand wanted Hillary Clinton to beat Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n\"He has no facts,\" Streisand told Australian \"60 Minutes\" host Michael Usher in a 2016 interview prior to the election. \"I don't know, I can't believe it. I'm either coming to your country, if you'll let me in, or Canada.\"\n\nStreisand didn't move out of the US, but she did criticize Trump in her 2018 studio album \"Walls.\"\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Stephen Colbert, Streisand said that she liked Joe Biden and thought he did a \"good job.\" When asked about the possibility of a second Trump administration, Streisand again said she'd move.\n\n\"I can't live in this country if he became president,\" she said, adding that she'd probably move to England.\n\nPer an Instagram post shared in early January amid the Los Angeles wildfires, it appears that Streisand still lives in Northern California. Reps for Streisand did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nIn November 2016, Page Six reported that Cher threatened to move if Trump was elected.\n\n\"I'm gonna have to leave the planet,\" she reportedly said at a fundraiser for Clinton.\n\nShe had a similar stance before Trump officially ran for reelection.\n\n\"I almost got an ulcer the last time,\" she told The Guardian in October 2023. \"If he gets in, who knows? This time I will leave [the country].\"\n\nHowever, as of publication, it doesn't appear that Cher has relocated. Reps for Cher did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nDays after the 2024 presidential election, \"Orange Is the New Black\" star Laverne Cox appeared on the podcast \"Just for Variety\" and spoke about the impact the results would have on the transgender community.\n\nCox said that she and some friends were considering moving, but no plans have been solidified yet.\n\n\"We're doing research on different cities in Europe and in the Caribbean,\" Cox said.\n\n\"I don't want to be in too much fear, but I'm scared,\" the actor added. \"As a public figure, with all my privilege, I'm scared, and I'm particularly scared because I'm a public figure. I feel like I could be targeted.\"\n\nAt the 2016 Matrix Awards, \"Girls\" actor Lena Dunham said that she was serious about moving if Trump won the election.\n\n\"I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will,\" Dunham said. \"I know a lovely place in Vancouver and I can get my work done from there.\"\n\nBut after the election results, Dunham changed her mind.\n\n\"I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and live and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right,\" she wrote in part in a note shared on Instagram.\n\n\"It's easy to joke about moving to Canada,\" she added. \"It's harder to see, and to love, the people who fill your mailbox with hate. It's harder to see what needs to be done and do it. It's harder to live, fully and painfully aware of the injustice surrounding us, to cherish and fear your country all at once. But I'm willing to try. Will you try with me?\"\n\nDunham did eventually leave her home in New York and moved to London. However, in an interview with the New Yorker published in July 2024, the actor said the move was prompted by work opportunities.\n\nRobin Wright, known for her roles in \"Forrest Gump\" and \"House of Cards,\" relocated to England for work and decided to make the move permanent.\n\nWright spends most of her time in the Chiltern Hills, a rural part of England about 44 miles outside London, and enjoys the peace and quiet it offers compared to her former home of Los Angeles.\n\n\"They're living,\" Wright told UK publication The Sunday Times in August. \"They're not in the car in traffic, panicked on a phone call, eating a sandwich. That's most of America. Everything's rush, competition and speed.\"\n\nWright mentioned during an appearance on The View that the UK's tax breaks make it advantageous for production, which is why she relocated there in the first place, but she's enjoyed her break from the US.\n\n\"I'm troubled, like many of us are, about this state of our country,\" Wright said. \"It's not the reason, I just — I'm so tranquil over there.\"\n\n\"Pretty Woman\" star Richard Gere and his wife Alejandra Silva sold their house in Connecticut for $10.75 million in November 2024 and moved to Spain.\n\nGere said the plan was to be closer to Silva's family in Spain, but on his way out of the country, he had some choice words about the US.\n\n\"We're in a very dark place in America where we have a bully and a thug who's the president of the United States,\" Gere said during a speech at Spain's Goya Awards in February.\n\nSilva told The Daily Mail that the move was not permanent, and that they plan on going back and forth between Spain and the US.\n\n\"We're always coming back,\" she said. We'll come back here in the summer because we have the kids at camp. We just have to balance our lives there and here.\"\n\nThe billionaire filmmaker has been visiting New Zealand since the 1990s, but he set roots there once the pandemic hit in 2020.\n\nSince then, Cameron has had another reason for staying.\n\n\"I'm not there for the scenery, I'm there for the sanity,\" he said in a January 2026 episode of \"In Depth with Graham Bensinger.\"\n\nAlong with supporting how New Zealanders handled the pandemic, Cameron has also voiced his opposition to Donald Trump. That led to Camera not just living there, but also making all his \"Avatar\" movies in the country. He became a citizen of New Zealand in 2025.\n\n\"I think it's horrifying,\" he told the New Zealand outlet Stuff in 2025 about Trump's reelection. \"I see it as a turn away from everything decent. America doesn't stand for anything if it doesn't stand for what it has historically stood for. It becomes a hollow idea, and I think they're hollowing it out as fast as they can for their own benefit.\"",

    "title": "10 Google Search Hacks Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "These tips can help you get better search results.",
    "fullText": "It's not just you. Google Search has become significantly worse in recent years. In the past, you only had to watch out for low-quality content filled with SEO-bait keywords. Today, you have to be wary of AI-generated garbage, misinformation, and a generally worse UI. Still, it's not impossible to find good search results on Google. I've found a number of tricks that have helped me reduce the number of low-quality entries Google returns for my searches. Here are 10 such tips everyone should know about before their next search:\n\nI'm still annoyed by Google's decision to slap AI right at the top of search results, and I make it a point to get rid of it every time I use a new browser or a new device. Doing this is much harder if you're using the Google Search app, so stick to web browsers if you want to rid yourself of AI results. To that end, there are actually a few easy ways to remove AI from Google's results. The quickest is to add -ai to your search queries and Google will remove AI results. Alternatively, you can try using the Hide Gemini browser extension.\n\nGoogle's best days were when it showed a simple page with 10 blue links the moment you searched for anything. If you want to return to that simplicity, you can use the Web search filter in Google. Once you search for something on Google, click the More button below the search bar up top, and select Web. This will remove all the clutter from Google Search and return 10 webpages at a time. If you use Chrome, you can simply type \"web\" in the address bar to start a Web search.\n\nI've also written about a browser extension called Lucky, which does the same thing in Safari for iPhone. Lucky is available at a one-time fee of $3, and, in my opinion, it's well worth the price.\n\nIf you know the domain you want to visit, you can limit your search to that domain alone. For example, you could restrict results to .gov if you only want to look at official US government sites, or .fr if you only wish to search websites registered in France. Just add site:.gov (or any other domain of your choice) to your search queries, and you'll find better results that way. It's also useful if you want to restrict searches to .ac.uk or .edu sites, which are more education-focused.\n\nIf you've found a trusted source that you like, such as Lifehacker, you can use Google to restrict your results only to that website. You can add site:lifehacker.com to your queries on Google, and it'll only show you results from this website. Just replace the name of the site with whichever one you like. This method is often better than using that site's internal search tools, too.\n\nWhen you're looking for specific information, you may be better off searching for a particular file format. For instance, if you're looking for scientific articles, you may have a better chance of finding a pdf file than a web result. In these cases, you can use the filetype:pdf filter to locate pdf files, and you can replace the file type to locate results in a different file format.\n\nIf you're finding significantly worse results using Google search, you can try to refine the results by using Google's built-in filters. Just below the search bar, you'll see a few tabs such as All, News, More, Tools, etc. Click through each of these to eliminate certain types of results. Specifically, the Tools tab lets you refine results by date, and even allows you to remove results for related search terms and focus only on exact matches.\n\nSometimes, basic Google search tools just aren't good enough to find what you need. This is particularly true when your search terms include words that are popular for other reasons. For instance, you're searching \"president,\" but not the president of your country. This is where advanced search could help you remove unwanted results. You can go to the Google Advanced Search page and use all the filters there to find what you need. Each filter has a helpful description right next to it, which makes it easy to figure out what you're doing.\n\nGoogle also allows you to upload files and images to find results. Open Google search and click the + button in the search bar to upload a file or an image. You can attach a query to the image, and Google will help answer that question, or you can even look for images similar to the one you've uploaded. This can be useful if you want to detect fake profiles online, as scammers often steal profile photos from others to create a fake identity.\n\nIf you can't always be bothered with using various manual methods to hide all the junk from your Google Search results, consider using a content blocker to do so. My favorite has long been uBlock Origin, which is available on desktop and on mobile. It'll remove all sponsored results, unwanted product listings, and most types of junk from your Google results.\n\nIf you really like and trust certain websites, you should add those as preferred sources on Google. This will ensure that results from those sites are highlighted among search results and the Top Stories section in your search results. Google rolled this feature out in 2025, and it's the most effective way to find information from higher quality websites.

    "description": "Prepare for Hollywood's big night by watching everything you can before the ceremony on March 15.",
    "fullText": "It's Oscar season! By which I mean, it's that time of year when movie dorks are in a rush to catch up on as many Oscar-nominated films as is feasible before the awards ceremony kicks off—which, this year, will be on March 15 on ABC. If box office and streaming numbers are any indication, there's a good chance you've seen this year's nominations front-runner, Sinners, which didn't just receive the most nominations in 2026, but received the most nominations ever (can't say I'm mad about it), but the second-most nominated movie of the year, Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, is also readily available.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't yet easily stream major nominees like Marty Supreme, Hamnet, and The Secret Agent, which are still making the rounds in theaters. It's also too early to stream the likes of Sirât, The Voice of Hind Rajab, Kohuko, Viva Verdi!, Arco, Zootopia 2, and Avatar: Fire and Ash, though there's a good chance that will change before the first envelopes are torn open. I'll continue to update this article as more movies drop on digital platforms. Unless your a hardcore cinema-goer, you should have plenty to occupy your eyeballs until then.\n\n16 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actor (Michael B. Jordan), Supporting Actor (Delroy Lindo), Actress (Wunmi Mosako), Directing (Ryan Coogler), Original Screenplay, Original Song (\"I Lied to You\"), Original Score, Casting, Cinematography, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Costume Design, Production Design, Sound, Visual Effects\n\nRyan Coogler's Sinners didn't just do pretty well with the nominations—it did historically well. The previous record has stood at 14 since 1950, when All About Eve deservedly won the night. Titanic and La La Land matched that number, but it's never been beaten until now (the addition of the new Best Casting category helping matters just a bit). Nominations aren't trophies—La La Land didn't wind up winning the actual Best Picture prize—but it's still a notable achievement.\n\nIt's also an Oscar rarity in another sense: Sinners is one of a very small handful of horror movies to be nominated for Best Picture and may well be only the second (after Silence of the Lambs) to win. Stream Sinners on HBO Max and Prime Video.\n\n13 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), Supporting Actor (Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn), Supporting Actress (Teyana Taylor), Director (Paul Thomas Anderson), Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Editing, Original Score, Production Design, Sound, Casting\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson, you will always be famous where Oscar is concerned. The director's dark comedy/action thriller earned a very impressive 13 nominations, including a Best Actor nod for Leonardo DiCaprio and supporting nominations for Teyana Taylor and Benicio Del Toro. Stream one Battle After Another on HBO Max.\n\n9 Nominations for: Best Picture, Supporting Actor (Jacob Elordi), Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Costume Design, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score, Production Design, Sound\n\nPerpetual Oscar fave Guillermo del Toro's long-gestating Frankenstein adaptation finally made it to theaters (albeit briefly—it's mostly a Netflix thing) this year, and the result was worth the wait. Sumptuous and appropriately horrifying, the director did Mary Shelley proud, and the film earned a very respectable nine nominations along the way. The all-time number of Frankenstein movies runs into the hundreds, but I'm pretty sure that this is the first one to get any significant Oscar love. Stream Frankenstein on Netflix.\n\n9 nominations for: Best Picture, Actress (Renate Reinsve), Supporting Actor (Stellan Skarsgård), Supporting Actress (Elle Fanning), Supporting Actress (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), Director (Joachim Trier), Original Screenplay, International Film, Editing\n\nThis Norwegian import from director Joachim Trier (The Worst Person in the World, which also starred Best Actress nominee Renate Reinsve) managed to pick up nominations in both the International Film and overall Best Picture categories. It's probably a long shot for the latter, but has a solid shot at the former. (Between this and Predator: Badlands, Elle Fanning had a great 2025.) Rent Sentimental Value from Prime Video.\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actress (Emma Stone), Adapted Screenplay, Original Score\n\nThis is the fifth Yorgos Lanthimos film to receive Oscar nominations in major categories, and the third that's up for Best Picture, following Poor Things a few years back, but the acclaimed, idiosyncratic director has yet to claim a trophy of his own. Stream Bugonia on Peacock.\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Editing, Sound, Visual Effects\n\nHeeeey it's that Apple movie that I saw a million ads for (Brad Pitt: The Movie\") that's apparently pretty good? I don't know, I'm not a car guy. But director Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick) sure knows how to film things going fast. Stream F1: The Movie on Apple TV+\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Original Song (\"Train Dreams\")\n\nClint Bentley's historical drama is slow, absolutely, but in a modern cinema landscape of constant distraction and over-explanation, its contemplative beauty feels revolutionary. Stream Train Dreams on Netflix.\n\n2 Nominations for: Original Song (\"Golden\"), Animated Film\n\nI'd have put this one up for the overall Best Picture trophy as well, but that's just me. Pure joy, and very likely to take home both of these awards (if \"Golden\" loses Best Original Song, the pre-teen set is likely to riot). Stream KPop Demon Hunters on Netflix.\n\n2 Nominations for: Actor (Ethan Hawke), Original Screenplay\n\nBesties Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke reunited to tell the story of Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart on the opening night of Oklahoma!. It sounds like a real niche movie, but it is well worth seeking out—Hawke is definitely a stealth contender for Best Actor. Rent Blue Moon from Prime Video.\n\n2 Nominations for: Original Screenplay, International Film\n\nA group of Iranian political prisoners, now free, must decide whether and in what way to take revenge in this film, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes last year but missed out on a Best Picture nomination. Rent It Was Just an Accident from Prime Video.\n\nNomination for: Actress (Rose Byrne)\n\nRose Byrne picks up a nomination for her role as a mother who's going through it. (I've heard this one called \"the Uncut Gems of parenting movies.\") Rent If I Had Legs I'd Kick You from Prime Video.\n\nNomination for: Supporting Actress (Amy Madigan)\n\nWas there any more memorable screen presence in 2025 than Aunt Gladys? No, there was not—even before that scene where...what happened to her...happened. Stream Weapons on HBO Max.\n\nThis might not be Pixar's best-reviewed film, but the story of a kid who becomes an inadvertent alien ambassador is pretty darn charming, nonetheless. Stream Elio on Disney+.\n\nNomination for: Actress (Kate Hudson)\n\nThe premise, dealing with the real-life, occasionally tragic story of a Neil Diamond tribute band, sounds like something I made up. But it's real, and also an Oscar nominee! It's great to see Hudson back in the spotlight a quarter-century after her breakout turn in Almost Famous. Rent Song Sung Blue from Prime Video.\n\nThe dinosaurs are back, and this time they're chasing Jonathan Bailey, Scarlett Johansson, and Mahershala Ali. Stream Jurassic World Rebirth on Peacock.\n\nNomination for: Original Song (\"Dear Me\")\n\nThis will be Diane Warren's 17th Original Song Oscar nomination and who knows maybe her first win? Stiff competition this year, though. (It's gonna be gonna be \"Golden,\" right?) Rent Diane Warren: Relentless from Prime Video.\n\nNomination for: Documentary Film\n\nThe filmmakers spent six years documenting abuse and murder within the Alabama prison system from the perspective of the incarcerated individuals, leading a movement for change. Stream The Alabama Solution on HBO Max.\n\nMatthew McConaughey and America Ferrera rush to save kids during the deadliest fire in California history in this true-ish story, which picked up a nod for it's too-real disaster effects. Stream The Lost Bus on Apple TV+.\n\nNomination for: Documentary Film\n\nThe story of queer American poet and activist Andrea Gibson, in their own words. Stream Come See Me in the Good Light on Apple TV+.\n\nNomination for: Makeup and Hairstyling\n\nAll in all, not a bad year for scary movies at the Oscars, with this impressive bit of body horror getting a surprise nod. Stream The Ugly Stepsister on Hulu.",

    "title": "Six Ways to Use Staging Psychology to Sell Your House",
    "description": "Staging a house isn’t just making it look clean and neat—it’s about manipulating folks to see themselves in the space.",
    "fullText": "Selling a house is one of the largest transactions most of us will ever make. Considering how much you’ve invested in the place in terms of both money and sweat equity, it’s natural to want to get as much profit from the sale as possible. One strategy to maximize profits that most real estate professionals will recommend is staging: temporarily dressing, furnishing, and arranging the home to make it as appealing as possible.\n\nStaging works—it’s been shown to speed up the time to sale and to increase the sale price of a house. But it’s not magic—there’s a specific psychology to staging a house that you have to keep in mind, especially if you’re choosing to do it yourself in order to save a few bucks. It might seem like all you need to do is freshen the paint, clean the place up, and make a few furnishing choices, but if you want to get the most bang for your staging buck, you should keep staging psychology in mind.\n\nThe first thing to know about house staging psychology is the fundamental purpose of staging: It’s not to make the house look clean or presentable—it’s to shape a narrative. Essentially, you’re telling prospective buyers how they could live in your home. From where they’ll have their morning coffee to where they’ll entertain, you want to help them imagine what life will be like in the house. The easier you make it for people to see themselves living their ideal life there, the easier it will be to close the sale.\n\nIn order to support that narrative, there are specific psychological levers you’ll be pulling as you stage.\n\nFirst impressions really do matter, and the first staging psychology lever you’ll pull is what’s known as the “primacy effect.” This is a common cognitive bias wherein the first impression we get of something influences our perceptions in an outsized way. In other words, if the first impression people get from your home is that it’s luxurious and comfortable, this will override any negative impressions they get later in the house tour.\n\nStaging itself helps with this, of course, but you should also focus on the curb appeal and the entryway of the house to really cement that first impression as positive. Then, consider the fact that each room or space within the house will also offer its own first impression—that’s why decluttering is so vital. Clearing out your stuff and leaving behind a clean, curated visual will let potential buyers see a house they can easily move into, instead of getting an impression that they’d be buying a lot of chores.\n\nThe next bit of staging psychology you need to implement is anchoring—you want buyers to see the house as valuable right away so that impression gets anchored in their heads. This is why staged homes tend to sell for higher prices.\n\nThis involves staging with expensive-looking furniture, if you can, and decorating in a luxe way that implies high value. Seeing high-end decor, smart technology, and other expensive features cements in people’s minds that this is a high-value house, and they will be more willing to pay a premium for it because of that perceived value. Anchoring this value also lets you use the next bit of staging psychology—the Halo Effect.\n\nThe Halo Effect is a cognitive bias where a positive impression prevents you from seeing the flaws or downsides. If your property is a bit old or needs some work, staging it with a fresh, luxe look not only anchors a higher value in buyer’s minds, it can actually cause them to overlook those flaws. Even if they’re aware of some of the problems on one level, the overall sense of value and comfort is what will drive their decision-making.\n\nIt’s important to note that you shouldn’t try to conceal problems or needed upgrades; that would be unethical. The goal here is to let the staging drive a potential buyer’s enthusiasm so they willingly overlook those problems in favor of the comfortable, high-value narrative you’ve constructed.\n\nA key aspect of staging is triggering an emotional response in folks touring your house. Your goal is to make them imagine living there, and to make that fantasy one they associate with positive emotions. To do that, you’ll engage their senses:\n\nLighting. Soft lighting and a focus on natural light creates a warm, inviting atmosphere.\n\nScent. A house that smells fresh and clean is a comfortable space that doesn’t hint at a lot of work to be done. (Pro tip: Get someone who doesn’t live there to sniff the place out; we often become nose-blind to how our house smells.) You can also try to trigger a sense of nostalgia with the tried-and-true trick of baking some cookies. Don’t go overboard—an entire can of air freshener, a house that smells overwhelmingly of cookies, or a house that smells like you just cleaned it using buckets of bleach can backfire. Subtlety is key.\n\nAspiration. We all know there’s the way we think we’re going to live our lives, and then there’s reality. You want to offer potential buyers the fantasy. Maybe you don’t spend time cozied up in a reading nook with a good book and a cup of tea, for example, but you wish you did—so create that reading nook for buyers to picture themselves in. Their emotional attachment to the idea will make them more positive about the house overall.\n\nWhen staging a house, an easy psychological approach is to group things—furniture, decorations, lighting, even color palettes—using the Rule of Three. This is exactly what it sounds like: Arranging things in subtle groups of odd numbers (typically three) and arranging them to have some height and texture variety. The psychological effect is that this is perceived as more natural and less “stagey” than even numbers, and odd numbers tickle the brain’s need for symmetry, so people will be more engaged with your house.\n\nFinally, you want to make a buyer’s path to imagining themselves living in your clean, fresh, artfully decorated home as easy as possible—so get rid of yourself. Decluttering and depersonalizing doesn’t mean bare walls and empty rooms, it means going neutral with your decor and artwork. Get rid of the hobbies, the personal collections, and that weird lamp everyone else hates. Leaving some personal touches, like a few tasteful photos of the family, is a good idea—you don’t want the house to feel like a hotel. But you also don’t want people to feel like they’re intruding, or like they’re picking their way through your dirty laundry.",

    "title": "Here's How Long It Really Takes to Form a New Habit",
    "description": "It's not 21 days, or even 66 days, no matter what the life hack industrial complex wants you to think.",
    "fullText": "Forming a habit is a powerful tool. You work the new thing into your daily routine, and soon enough, it becomes automatic. That's the dream, anyway—in reality, you have to work at it. But how long does it take to fully form a habit? Despite what you may have heard, it’s not necessarily just 21 days.\n\nThe number of days it takes to form a new habit depends on the habit, on you, and on what strategies you’re using to build and maintain that habit. Scientific estimates have ranged from as little as 21 days, to eight months or more. Let’s look at why that range is so big, and what you can do to build habits faster.\n\nThe idea that a habit takes 21 days to form came from a surgeon, Maxwell Maltz. He observed that it seemed to take about three weeks for a person to get used to their new body after an operation like amputation or plastic surgery, James Clear writes. (Having gone through a few minor surgeries, I recall that it takes between two and three weeks for pain and swelling to subside enough that you aren’t constantly thinking about the fact you just had surgery; I have to wonder if that’s related.)\n\nThe surgeon’s idea was that it takes 21 days for people to dissolve and re-form a “mental image” of themselves. This isn’t backed by research; it’s just one guy’s gut feeling. But I think it stuck because it fits a lot of our experiences.\n\nLet’s say you want to get up early to exercise first thing in the morning. Well, of course you can do it once. But how do you make it a habit? When I was in that situation—becoming a morning exerciser despite not being a morning person—I made myself commit for a full week before I even allowed myself to complain about it or adjust my plan. I had to be up at 6 a.m. every day, five days in a row, non-negotiable. I enjoyed having a break on the weekend, and then the second week was much easier. By the end of the third, this really was my new normal. I kept it up for at least a year after that.\n\nEven though the 21-day rule isn’t based on science, it’s a good timeframe for a “trial run” of a new habit. After all, one day can be a fluke. One or two weeks is a timeframe we’ve been through before, and we can ride out a disruption to our normal life that long (imagine a vacation, or a week’s crunch time before a work deadline). But by the time you get to three weeks, or better yet, a full month, you’ve learned some things about your new habit and how it fits into your life. Even the simplest habits are never actually simple; you need to learn and practice a bunch of mini-skills in the process of building almost any habit.\n\nSo, by that 21-day mark, you’ve done the thing a bunch of times. Importantly, you’ve likely weathered a few interruptions or obstacles (like the weekend) and gotten back on track. It’s probably a good rule of thumb for a timeframe that is long enough to feel like “real life.” But that doesn’t mean it’s enough.\n\nScientific research has attempted to measure how long it takes for a habit to truly become automatic. For example, this study asked participants to choose a habit and to attach it to something they did once a day (for example, “eat a piece of fruit with lunch”). The study lasted 12 weeks. Some of the participants felt their new habit was automatic after just a few weeks; many others weren’t there yet at the end of the study. The researchers concluded that most people would form an automatic habit anywhere between two and eight months...according to a model that they calculated would only apply to 62 (about 75%) of the participants.\n\nThat’s a wide range, and we don’t know whether the rest of the people would have ever gotten to a point where the habit was automatic. The researchers also found that simpler habits (like drinking water) were quicker to become automatic than harder or more complex ones (like doing 50 sit-ups).\n\nA 2012 review looked at several other estimates and concluded that it would make more sense to tell people to expect at least 10 weeks for their new habit to become automatic, but also that it helps a lot just to know that any habit keeps getting easier the longer you do it. Those authors point out that expecting a habit to form in 21 days can make people discouraged, and instead it’s better to focus on the payoff of “working effortfully on a new behavior for 2-3 months.”\n\nSetting time-based commitments can be a helpful tool, like getting through the first week before changing the plan, or using your new moisturizer every day until the bottle is empty. But another school of thought holds that long-term behavior change is better described by “stages of change” than by calendar dates. There is a \"contemplation\" stage where you're thinking about how you'll do the new behavior, and a \"preparation stage\" where you're gathering supplies and testing the waters—say, buying new running shoes, or taking one fitness class to see how you like it.\n\nIn some cases, a habit takes longer to form than you hope. But you may be able to get a habit to stick sooner than expected if you are intentional about the way you form the habit. Working consciously on your new habit can make it last longer, too, as we see in the maintenance stage.\n\nYour initial habit-forming period—whether you want to think of it as 21 days, or 66 days, or, heck, eight months—is what behavior change psychologists call the action stage. You’ve begun the habit, but it’s not automatic yet and you might not be convinced that you’re really going to continue. In this stage, you can make your habit more likely to stick by doing the following:\n\nRemind yourself of your motivation to do it. For example, stick your reminder card for your next dentist’s appointment on your bathroom mirror, so that you remember not just that you should floss your teeth, but also why you want to floss your teeth.\n\nRestructure your environment to give you cues and support. For example, if you want to run every morning, set your shoes out the night before and have your spouse ask you how your run went when you return.\n\nBuild self-efficacy by celebrating your small wins. This could mean checking off the days you did the thing on a calendar, but it could also involve working toward milestones (like total number of miles run) or making benchmarks of your progress (maybe you used to do your daily pushups with your hands on a chair, but now you can do them on the floor).\n\nPlan ahead for how you’ll maintain your habit even when you’re interrupted (more about that in a minute).\n\nOnce you’ve built some momentum, you’re in the maintenance stage. You’re doing the habit, and maybe it’s starting to feel automatic, or at least more of a part of your life than it used to be. In this stage, you may need to do some things like the following:\n\nReevaluate your plan. Is running every day still working for you? Maybe it makes more sense to make some of the runs longer and designate other days for rest, yoga, or strength training.\n\nThink ahead to obstacles you might face. If you go on a vacation, will you continue the habit? If you end up falling off the wagon for whatever reason, how will you get back on?\n\nMake sure your motivation is something that will continue to work for you. For example, if you found it really motivating to keep up a streak on the calendar, the real test will come when you inevitably break your streak. At that point, there needs to be something other than the streak that is keeping you at it. This is often something intrinsic: You like being the person who flosses every day. You’re excited to You’re happy that your cholesterol is down from the way you’ve been eating.\n\nBuilding a habit is not a matter of white-knuckling it until you hit a magic number of days. It’s a process that takes effort the whole time, even when you’re five years in. Habits are work, but the ones that last are the ones where the work feels worthwhile.",

There are scripts to copy (which I'm not going to include here in case they change in the future).\n\nWindows users will need to run PowerShell as an admin—the easiest way to do that is by right-clicking PowerShell in the start menu and clicking \"Run as administrator.\" There is a different script for Mac and Linux users—that one just needs to be copied into a regular Terminal.\n\nEither way, you will be asked which browser you'd like to update the settings for—just hit the number corresponding to what you want to do.\n\nIn my testing, the process was very simple on Windows—just click the number and the script will do its thing. On macOS, I needed to follow a few instructions to enable a configuration policy in the Settings app, something that only took a couple of clicks. After that, Chrome was free of any and all references to AI.\n\nA number of other features were also gone, including those annoying prompts to switch my default browser.\n\nThe way this works is kind of interesting: it uses features intended for large organizations. Basically all major browsers allow for group settings, which is how IT departments control what you can and can't do with your browser. Among these settings are ones to disable AI features.\n\nIt's an interesting workaround, and hopefully one that keeps working. There is always a chance that browser companies make it so even IT departments can't disable AI features, at which point we'll all need to find a new solution (or switch to an alternative browser).",

    "fullText": "If you're a Pixel owner, you may want to update your settings for Phone by Google. 9to5Google reports that a handful of users have experienced a bug with the Take a Message feature that records and sends audio to callers as they are leaving a voicemail.\n\nTake a Message is a recently introduced feature for the Phone app that activates when the recipient is not available to answer (or declines the incoming call). The caller hears the following: “The person you have called is not available. Please leave a message after the tone.” If you, as the recipient, tap the Take a message notification on your device, you can see a transcript of the audio in real time and hit Answer if you want to pick up. (Take a Message will also detect spam calls and mark them with a warning.)\n\nA few users have reported that Take a Message has activated and allowed the caller to hear the recipient's background audio as they are leaving a message. It's important to note that this is not a widespread issue, and most of the reports come from people with older Pixel devices that no longer get OS updates. According to 9to5Google, Google is investigating the reports.\n\nAgain, while this doesn't seem to be a bug affecting most Pixel users, you can disable Take a Message if you are concerned about privacy, especially with unknown callers.\n\nOpen the Phone app on your device and tap the icon in the top-left corner to open Settings. Tap Take a Message under the Call Assist section and toggle the feature off.",

    "title": "A Study Found Diet Coke Is Better for You Than Water (Sort Of)",
    "description": "I won’t say it’s “healthier,” but it certainly doesn’t seem to be any worse.",
    "fullText": "I’m sure you’ve seen the studies that come out from time to time showing that diet sodas are arguably kinda-sorta bad for you. (Their evidence is never very strong.) But did you see the new study that found diet soda was better than water for people with type 2 diabetes? Not only is it a real study, it was well-designed and we should be paying attention to it, according to an epidemiologist I talked to who was not involved in the study.\n\nThat epidemiologist is Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz of the University of Wollongong, who wrote about it here. When I asked him if it was a good or a bad thing that this study had mostly escaped notice by news media, he said “this is far more robust than most of the science that gets media coverage.” The study was not sponsored by any commercial drink company.\n\nIn the delightfully named SODAS trial (Study Of Drinks with Artificial Sweeteners), researchers at the University of California, Irvine, and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, recruited adults who had type 2 diabetes and who had a habit of drinking artificially sweetened beverages (including, but not limited to, my one true love Diet Coke). The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nHalf of them were asked to switch to drinking water instead, and everyone was provided with three servings a day of either their diet drink of choice, or a water of their choice (unsweetened seltzer included). The study ran for 24 weeks. There were 181 people enrolled, of which 179 finished the study, which is considered a fairly large group for a study of this type. (It's twice as large as an older study I'll contrast it with below.)\n\nThe main outcome the researchers studied was hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) as measured by a blood test. This is a common test used to monitor glucose control in people who have diabetes or are at risk for it. The higher your HbA1C, the higher your blood glucose has probably been over the past three months or so.\n\nThe results: HbA1C got slightly better in the group that was drinking artificial sweeteners: from 7.19% to 7.14%. It got worse in the group that was drinking water, from 7.20% to 7.44%.\n\nThe researchers collected a few other metrics, for good measure. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and “time in range” as measured by a continuous glucose monitor all favored the diet drinks group. The people in the diet drinks group lost a little bit of weight (on average, two pounds) while those in the water group had stable weights. The researchers referred to this difference in weight loss as “statistically significant, but not clinically significant.” In other words, probably real, but too small to matter.\n\nBottom line: there was no real benefit to the people in the study switching from diet sodas to water; if anything, doing so may have slightly hurt their health.\n\nOK, maybe I mean me and my Diet Coke habit. I fully admit to being biased here, but in an educated way. I like my Diet Coke. I’ve also been keeping an eye on research about artificial sweeteners over the years, and while I won’t necessarily defend my soda as health food, nothing has ever convinced me that it’s bad for me. (Sugar-sweetened sodas are a different story; those, we should probably all avoid.)\n\nNow, we have a reasonably large, well-designed, independently-funded study showing that artificially sweetened drinks are possibly better for you than water. I still haven’t seen any news coverage of it, even though a study with the opposite results got coverage a few years back. That study involved 81 women with diabetes in a weight-loss trial, and their HbA1C improved slightly with water compared to diet drinks. Even so, one expert that Everyday Health spoke to about it said that he was “of the opinion that the health risks of diet sodas are overstated.” (Meanwhile, the authors of the most recent study point out that comparing that study to theirs isn’t quite apples-to-apples, since it was a weight loss trial and this one is not.)\n\nThat’s an important point to remember about any study on a specific food: they usually apply to a specific medical condition or population. We like to file them away in our mind as “Diet Coke good” or “Diet Coke bad,” but each study only gives us a piece of the puzzle, not a generality. For example this study tells us nothing about Diet Coke’s effects on people who have poorly controlled diabetes, or who don’t have diabetes at all; and it doesn’t say anything about measures other than those related to blood sugar. It didn’t even specifically study Diet Coke, although it’s likely that Diet Coke was one of the more popular beverages participants chose.\n\nTo be clear, it is entirely possible that this isn’t a real effect, and and that water and diet drinks are basically equivalent when it comes to your blood glucose and your health. Meyerowitz-Katz says this is probably the most likely explanation, but we can’t rule out the possibility that diet sodas may help glucose control in type 2 diabetes. Maybe they satisfy a sweet tooth and help people avoid other sugary snacks, for example.\n\nThe researchers write that their main takeaway is that “maintaining usual [artificially-sweetened beverage] intake may be a tool to continue to help manage T2D if glycemic measures are controlled and stable.” Meyerowitz-Katz agrees: “At worst, there is no difference between diet soft drinks and water when it comes to diabetes control. At best, the diet drinks might be sightly better.”",

    "fullText": "Welsh Fire have signed former England international Chris Woakes for the 2026 season of The Hundred.\n\nThe 36-year-old is a one-day and T20 World Cup winner described by Welsh Fire as \"one of the most respected all-rounders in world cricket\".\n\nWoakes had signed for the Fire last year but was unable to make an appearance after dislocating his shoulder in his last ever Test match against India in August.\n\nWith over 300 international wickets and experience in franchise leagues across the world, Welsh Fire will be hoping the white-ball veteran helps turn the side's fortunes around after a tough few years.\n\nWoakes said: \"I'm absolutely delighted to return to Welsh Fire for this year's Hundred campaign.\n\n\"I was gutted not to be able to take to the field last year in Wales due to the shoulder injury, but I'm really excited to be coming back and to play in front of Welsh Fire fans.\"\n\nDespite his vast experience across white-ball competitions, Woakes has only played three games in The Hundred - for Birmingham Phoenix in 2023.\n\nWelsh Fire men's head coach Michael Hussey said: \"Chris is a world-class cricketer and a fantastic addition to our group.\n\n\"His experience, professionalism and ability to influence games with both bat and ball will be invaluable for us, both on and off the field.\"\n\nWoakes follows Phil Salt, Rachin Ravindra and Marco Jansen in becoming Welsh Fire's fourth and final direct signing.\n\nAn auction will take place in March where the franchises will bid for players to determine their final squads for the 2026 edition of the competition.",

Ted Cruz (R-TX) pushed back on critics pouncing on him over an image of the senator on a plane to California just days before Texas is set to get hit with a major winter storm.\n\n“Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front,” political strategist Shea Jordan Smith wrote on X this week.\n\nIncluded was an image of Cruz on his flight.

He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit,” a spokesperson for the senator said in a statement, first shared with KHOU.\n\nMultiple critics invoked another moment from Cruz’s career where he went viral and earned plenty of mockery. In February 2021, Cruz was heavily criticized after took a trip to Cancun, Mexico, while Texas was hit with the deadly Winter Storm Uri.\n\nThe senator returned to Texas at the time and admitted his trip was “obviously a mistake.”\n\n“It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” he said.\n\nThe latest storm is expected to stretch across 2,000 miles eventually, while it’ll begin in Texas and Oklahoma. Heavy snowfall and freezing rain are expected to begin Friday, hitting northern Texas and cities like Dallas and Houston. The storm will eventually move its way to the East Coast.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott (R) has declared a state of emergency in his state over the approaching harsh weather.\n\n“Based on current forecasts, the State of Texas is acting to ensure Texans have the resources they need before severe winter weather impacts communities across Texas,” the governor announced this week. “I thank emergency management personnel and first responders for working tirelessly to keep Texans safe.”\n\nThe post Ted Cruz Bites Back at Critics Furious Over His Leaving Texas Ahead of Major Winter Storm first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Greenland's ownership was not Russia's concern and that the United States and Denmark - whose historical",
    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Greenland's ownership was not Russia's concern and that the United States and Denmark - whose historical treatment ​of the island he criticised - should sort the matter out between themselves.\n\nMoscow has watched ‌with glee as U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to acquire Greenland has widened Washington's split with Europe, even though his moves ‌could have ramifications for Russia, which already has a strong Arctic presence.\n\nSpeaking in Davos, Trump on Wednesday stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland and ruled out the use of force. He suggested progress towards a deal to end a dispute over the semi-autonomous Danish territory that risked ⁠the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations ‌in decades.\n\nPutin, addressing the matter for the first time in public, signalled that Russia would not object to Trump's push to control Greenland, which he speculated ‍may be worth nearly $1 billion.\n\n\"What happens in Greenland is of no concern to us whatsoever,\" Putin told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.\n\n\"Incidentally, Denmark has always treated Greenland as a colony and has been quite harsh, if not ​cruel, towards it. But that is a different matter altogether, and hardly anyone is interested ‌in it now,\" Putin added.\n\nDenmark's financial and military support for Ukraine has angered Russia, which is fighting to take full control of four Ukrainian regions it claimed as its own in 2022.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry has bridled at Trump's suggestion that Moscow has ambitions on Greenland too, but has been careful not to criticise Trump - who is trying to broker a deal to end the ⁠war in Ukraine - and has hinted it has some sympathy ​for his claim.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that ​the giant resource-rich island, which already has a U.S. military presence, was not \"a natural part\" of Denmark.\n\nPutin recalled that Russia in 1867 sold Alaska to the United ‍States for $7.2 million, and that ⁠Denmark in 1917 sold the Virgin Islands to Washington, setting precedents for such land transactions.\n\nUsing the Alaska price - adjusted for inflation and accounting for the larger size of Greenland and ⁠changes in gold prices, Putin said buying Greenland from Denmark could cost around $1 billion, which he said he thought Washington ‌could afford.\n\n\"I think they will sort it out between themselves,\" said Putin.",

    "title": "15 Annoying Habits That Are Actually Signs You’re Highly Intelligent",
    "description": "These annoying habits are actually a sign of high intelligence.",
    "fullText": "You’ve probably been told you’re “too intense,” “overly analytical,” or “kind of a lot.” Maybe people joke that you’re exhausting, picky, or difficult, even when you’re just being yourself. What often gets labeled as annoying behavior is sometimes just intelligence operating at a different speed or depth than the people around you. If any of these habits sound familiar, it might not be a personality flaw—it might be how your brain actually works.\n\nYou don’t accept surface-level explanations easily, and you’re rarely satisfied with a quick answer. When something doesn’t make sense, you want context, reasoning, and follow-up details. To other people, this can feel like interrogation or nitpicking. To you, it’s basic curiosity and clarity.\n\nCognitive psychology research shows that highly intelligent people are more likely to engage in exploratory questioning because their brains are wired to detect gaps in logic. You’re not trying to challenge authority or slow things down. You’re trying to understand how the system actually works. That depth-first thinking can be uncomfortable for people who prefer shortcuts.\n\nYou replay conversations, decisions, and possibilities long after others have moved on. What looks like anxiety or indecision is often your brain running complex simulations. You’re not stuck—you’re processing. Your mind wants to anticipate outcomes before committing.\n\nStudies on high cognitive ability show that intelligent people engage in more counterfactual thinking, meaning they mentally test multiple scenarios. This helps with long-term decision-making but can look exhausting from the outside. Your brain is doing heavy lifting, even when you’re sitting still. Silence doesn’t mean inactivity.\n\nSmall talk drains you faster than physical work, and repetitive tasks feel unbearable. When there’s nothing mentally stimulating happening, your attention starts wandering immediately. People may think you’re disengaged or rude. In reality, your brain is underfed.\n\nNeuroscience research links boredom sensitivity to higher baseline cognitive processing needs. Your mind requires novelty, complexity, or challenge to stay regulated. When the environment doesn’t provide that, you disconnect. It’s not arrogance—it’s a neurological mismatch.\n\nYou often finish people’s sentences or jump ahead in conversations. This can come across as impatience or dominance. What’s actually happening is that your brain recognized the pattern early. You already see where the thought is going.\n\nHighly intelligent individuals tend to process information faster, especially in familiar domains. Waiting for others to arrive at the same conclusion can feel painfully slow. You’re not trying to steal the spotlight—you’re struggling with pacing differences. Conversation speed isn’t universal.\n\nStep-by-step directions feel irritating when you already understand the underlying concept. You want to know why something works, not just how to follow it. Being told exactly what to do can feel restrictive rather than helpful. Others may interpret this as defiance.\n\nResearch on problem-solving styles shows that intelligent thinkers prefer principle-based learning over rote instruction. You want autonomy, not micromanagement. When systems feel inefficient, your brain pushes back. Compliance without understanding doesn’t feel logical to you.\n\nInaccuracies bother you more than they bother others. When someone states something incorrectly, it feels unresolved until it’s corrected. You’re not trying to embarrass anyone. Your brain wants alignment with reality.\n\nPsychological studies on truth-bias sensitivity show that intelligent individuals experience stronger discomfort with factual inconsistency. Letting errors slide feels mentally itchy. You value accuracy because it protects understanding. Silence can feel dishonest.\n\nYou enjoy solitude not because you dislike people, but because your brain needs space to process. Constant interaction can feel overstimulating. Alone time isn’t loneliness—it’s recovery. Others may see this as antisocial.\n\nResearch on intelligence and introversion shows a strong correlation between high cognitive capacity and lower social stimulation needs. Your mind is already busy. Quiet gives it room to stretch. That preference is regulation, not withdrawal.\n\nWasted time, unnecessary meetings, and roundabout processes irritate you deeply. You see faster, cleaner ways to do things and struggle when systems ignore them. This can make you seem impatient or controlling. Internally, you’re optimizing.\n\nHigh-level problem solvers naturally scan for efficiency gaps. Your frustration comes from seeing potential improvements that aren’t being used. You’re not nitpicking—you’re noticing friction. Efficiency feels calming to your nervous system.\n\nWhen something captures your attention, you go all in. You read everything, watch everything, and think about it constantly—until you don’t. Then you move on just as intensely. Others may think you’re flaky.\n\nThis pattern aligns with intellectual curiosity cycles rather than a lack of commitment. Research on polymathic thinkers shows that deep but temporary immersion is common. You’re collecting frameworks, not hobbies. Each interest feeds the next.\n\nBackground noise that others ignore can completely derail your focus. You notice overlapping sounds, visual clutter, and interruptions immediately. People may accuse you of being dramatic. Your brain is just highly responsive.\n\nSensory processing research shows that intelligent individuals often have heightened perceptual sensitivity. More information is coming in at once. Managing input becomes essential for thinking clearly. Distraction isn’t minor when your processing load is high.\n\nYou don’t automatically accept “that’s just how it’s done.” Rules, traditions, and expectations feel optional if they don’t make sense. This can come across as rebellious or difficult. For you, it’s logical consistency.\n\nIntelligent thinkers are more likely to evaluate norms through reason rather than conformity. You’re not trying to disrupt for fun. You’re checking whether the rule still serves a purpose. Compliance without rationale feels irrational.\n\nYou value clarity over cushioning, especially when discussing ideas. Emotional padding sometimes feels unnecessary or misleading. Others may interpret your directness as harsh. You’re aiming for precision.\n\nLinguistic studies show that intelligent communicators prioritize information density over emotional framing. Your intent isn’t cruelty—it’s accuracy. Tone mismatches often come from differing communication priorities. Meaning gets lost in translation.\n\nConversations that stay superficial for too long drain you. You crave depth, nuance, and big-picture thinking. When discussions never go there, you disengage. Others may see this as arrogance.\n\nIntellectual stimulation is a basic need for you, not a luxury. Research on cognitive engagement shows that intelligent individuals require complexity to stay emotionally invested. Without it, boredom sets in fast. Depth keeps you present.\n\nYou feel things deeply, even when you understand them logically. Your emotional reactions don’t cancel out your intelligence—they coexist with it. This intensity can surprise people who expect smart individuals to be detached. You’re anything but.\n\nPsychological research increasingly links high intelligence with emotional depth rather than emotional distance. You process feelings with the same complexity as ideas. That depth can be overwhelming to others. It’s not instability—it’s capacity.\n\nRelaxation doesn’t come easily because your mind keeps generating connections. Even during rest, ideas keep forming. People may suggest you’re anxious or obsessive. You’re simply wired for constant synthesis.\n\nCognitive studies show that intelligent brains have higher default-mode network activity. Thought generation doesn’t stop just because the day ends. Rest looks different for you. Mental motion is your baseline.",

    "title": "Not AT&T, Not Verizon: This Is JD Power's Overall Best In Wireless Network Quality",
    "description": "Last year, Verizon was the leading wireless network provider in multiple regions around the United States, but this year it passes the crown.",
    "fullText": "According to Vol. 1 of J.D. Power's 2026 U.S. Wireless Network Quality Performance Study, T-Mobile is your best bet for the strongest wireless network quality. The latest edition of the annual study took a look at how consistently top networks place at or near the top across every region measured. And while Verizon Wireless came out ahead in the North Central U.S. and tied T-Mobile in a few others, the magenta-colored mobile network still ended up with fewer problems reported per 100 uses overall.\n\nThat's the study's core metric: PP100. Lower PP100 scores mean better network quality. Essentially, fewer dropped calls, faster data speeds, and fewer connectivity issues during normal device use. Just because T-Mobile's PP100 scores were lowest overall doesn't mean all the other networks in competition aren't worth using, of course. Industrywide, almost all wireless networks are performing at a high level of functionality, with the only exception being AT&T.\n\nWhile J.D. Power reports the national average holding steady at a PP100 score of nine or less over the past year, AT&T was at or above that in every region they measured. The study was based on responses from 20,050 customers surveyed between June and November 2025 and also included feedback on smartphones, tablets, and home internet devices for the most comprehensive view of real-world network reliability.\n\nBig picture, T-Mobile ranks highest outright in the Southeast and Southwest with eight PP100 in both regions. It also ties with Verizon Wireless for the top spot in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and West, with scores ranging from eight to nine PP100 depending on the region. And while T-Mobile is the overall best, Verizon earned the lowest PP100 score on a region-to-region basis, with a six in North Central U.S. AT&T's 11 PP100 in the Northeast is the worst score in the entire study, region-to-region or overall, so it's not hard to see why AT&T is making some major adjustments this year.\n\nThese 2026 findings are a real shake-up compared to last year's. In 2025, Verizon Wireless was the most frequent regional leader, and national average PP100 scores were higher than they are now. Then, customers reported an average of 11 problems per 100 uses, up from nine in 2024. This year, it's back down to nine. Verizon Wireless ranked highest in four regions in 2025: Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, West, and tied with AT&T for the top spot in the Southwest. At the time, T-Mobile claimed first only in the Southeast, and with 11 PP100 to boot. With so many changes coming to T-Mobile in 2026, it'll be interesting to see how next year's findings pan out.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Ever since their discovery more than 165 years ago, massive fossilized structures left by an organism known as Prototaxites have proven impossible to categorize.\n\nResearchers in the UK have suggested in a recently published study that there's a very good reason these oddities don't fit neatly on the tree of life – they belong to a branch all of their own, with no modern equivalent.\n\nSome 400 million years ago, the swamps of the late Silurian period would have sprouted a mix of horsetails, ferns, and other prototype plants that look positively alien today.\n\nAmong them stretched 8-meter (26-foot) tall towers that defy easy identification. Wide and branchless, these organisms may have been a form of algae or ancient conifer, researchers suspect, based on what little evidence remains.\n\nFossils found on the shores of Gaspé Bay in Quebec, Canada, were initially considered by geologist John William Dawson to be the remains of rotting trees, leading to his naming it 'first conifer' back in the 1850s.\n\nThough the name stuck, confusion over the fossil's classification continued until National Museum of Natural History paleontologist Francis Hueber confirmed in 2001 that Prototaxites was indeed most likely an enormous fungus.\n\nThat conclusion was backed up years later in 2017 by a subsequent analysis of a fossil fragment assumed to be from the peripheral region of a smaller Prototaxites species named P. taiti.\n\nThe 2017 study claimed to identify textures that resembled the fertile structures of today's Ascomycota fungi.\n\nNot everybody is convinced, however, given the possibility that the distinct fragments might not have even been connected.\n\n\"In the books and books of anatomy written about living fungi, we never find structures like that,\" University of Edinburgh paleobotanist Alexander Hetherington told Erik Stokstad at Science Magazine.\n\nHetherington co-led a study on three different P. taiti fragments, concluding there's insufficient evidence to conclude Prototaxites is a fungus at all.\n\nThrough a review of microscopic anatomy and chemical analysis of its tubular structures, the team of researchers systematically eliminated each and every candidate group, leaving no modern organism with which it might share some kind of ancestral relationship.\n\nFungi? Rejected thanks to the unique way its anatomy connects.\n\nA plant or algae? Not likely given its chemical composition.\n\nA mix of the two, such as a lichen? Not with that anatomy.\n\nSome bizarre animal? Cell walls say no chance.\n\n\"Based on this investigation we are unable to assign Prototaxites to any extant lineage, reinforcing its uniqueness,\" the researchers claim.\n\n\"We conclude that the morphology and molecular fingerprint of P. taiti is clearly distinct from that of the fungi and other organisms preserved alongside it in the [Devonian deposit], and we suggest that it is best considered a member of a previously undescribed, entirely extinct group of eukaryotes.\"\n\nWhat might have happened to this long-dead group of organisms is anybody's guess. Further reviews may even return the mystifying group back to its box among ancient fungi.\n\nWithout similar specimens to relate them to, Prototaxites may simply remain a fossil anomaly – a reminder that evolution is a constant experiment, one littered with far more failures than we may ever have realized.\n\nThis research was published in Science.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in March 2025 before the research was peer-reviewed.\n\nA Cycle Deep Within Earth's Crust May Affect Climate More Than We Thought\n\nClever Cow Documented Using Tools in an Astonishing Scientific First\n\nGigantic Wave in The Pacific Was The Most Extreme 'Rogue Wave' on Record",

    "fullText": "PONCE, Puerto Rico/HOUSTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Two oil tankers seized this month by the U.S. in its campaign against Venezuela were near Puerto Rico on Wednesday, a Reuters witness and Tankertrackers.com ​data said, the first sightings almost since their capture and a possible hint at their destination.\n\nThe ships are supertanker ‌M Sophia, seized by the U.S. on January 7 carrying Venezuelan oil, and the smaller tanker Galileo, formerly called Veronica and taken last week empty, although ‌it has previously carried Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe M Sophia and Galileo are among seven vessels linked to Venezuelan oil exports captured by the U.S. military and Coast Guard in recent weeks, mostly in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nU.S. officials have not disclosed destinations or plans for the seized vessels. The U.S. Coast Guard declined to comment, directing inquiries to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a ⁠request for a comment.\n\nBecause the vessels' geolocating ‌beacons have not been turned on, the locations of M Sophia and Galileo were unknown until the Tankertrackers.com and witness confirmation on Wednesday.\n\nThe vessels could remain in Puerto Rico or be moved to another ‍U.S. port. The other five captured tankers are near the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Venezuelan waters and near Scotland, shipping data showed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. intervention — including the capture of President Nicolás Maduro on January 3 — is aimed at stopping drug trafficking.\n\nWashington intends to ​direct Venezuela’s government and revive the country’s crippled oil sector by bringing major U.S. oil companies in to rebuild it.\n\nTrump ‌has imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil, which in December brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have accelerated in January under U.S. supervision, but millions of barrels remain in onshore and floating storage.\n\nThe U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, sources told Reuters last week. This week, vessel Sagitta was intercepted.\n\nAlong with most tankers under Western sanctions or part of the so-called shadow fleet, many of the Venezuela-linked tankers were ⁠built over 20 years ago and pose hazards to shipping because they ​lack safety certification and adequate insurance, experts said.\n\nThat means that if they have ​a collision or oil spill, establishing insurance claims or liability is very difficult to impossible, shipping and insurance industry sources said.\n\nThe age of these tankers, which exceeds the industry standard of 15 years, also raises ‍concern about potential environmental damage, the ⁠sources said.\n\nU.S. government civil forfeiture claims related to the ship seizures can take months or years to resolve, meaning there may be no immediate solutions to the challenges.\n\n\"These 'dark fleet' tankers can be incredibly unsafe. They are elderly, their crew ⁠work in unsafe conditions, lack the appropriate classification surveys, and they are often backed by fake insurance or no insurance at all,\" said David Tannenbaum, ‌a director at consulting firm Blackstone Compliance Services.",

    "fullText": "Amidst a cache of glittering golden treasures from the Iberian Bronze Age, a pair of corroded objects might be the most precious of all.\n\nA dull bracelet and a rusted hollow hemisphere decorated with gold are forged, researchers have found, not out of metal from beneath the ground, but with iron from meteorites that fell from the sky.\n\nThe discovery, led by now-retired head of conservation at the National Archeological Museum in Spain, Salvador Rovira-Llorens, was revealed in a paper in 2024, and suggests that metalworking technology and techniques in Iberia more than 3,000 years ago were far more advanced than we thought.\n\nThe Treasure of Villena, as the cache of 66 mostly gold objects is known, was discovered more than 60 years ago in 1963 in what is now Alicante in Spain, and has since come to be regarded as one of the most important examples of Bronze Age goldsmithing in the Iberian Peninsula, and the whole of Europe.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary:\n\nDetermining the age of the collection has been somewhat difficult, thanks to two objects: a small, hollow hemisphere, thought to be part of a scepter or sword hilt; and a single, torc-like bracelet.\n\nBoth have what archaeologists have described as a \"ferrous\" appearance – that is, they seem to be made of iron.\n\nIn the Iberian Peninsula, the Iron Age – where smelted terrestrial iron began to replace bronze – didn't start until around 850 BCE.\n\nThe problem is that the gold materials have been dated to between 1500 and 1200 BCE. So working out where the ferrous-looking artifacts sit in the context of the Treasure of Villena has been something of a puzzle.\n\nBut iron ore from Earth's crust is not the only source of malleable iron. There are a number of pre-Iron Age iron artifacts around the world that were forged from the stuff of meteorites.\n\nPerhaps most famous is the meteoritic iron dagger of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, but there are other Bronze Age weapons made of the material, and they were very highly prized.\n\nThere is a way to tell the difference: iron from meteorites has a much higher nickel content than iron dug out of Earth's ground.\n\nSo researchers obtained permission from the Municipal Archaeological Museum of Villena, which houses the collection, to carefully test the two artifacts, and determine just how much nickel they contained.\n\nThey carefully took samples of both artifacts and subjected the material to mass spectrometry to determine their composition.\n\nIn spite of the high degree of corrosion, which alters the elemental makeup of the artifact, the results strongly suggest that both the hemisphere and the bracelet were made from meteoritic iron.\n\nThis neatly solves the dilemma of how the two artifacts align with the rest of the collection: They were made around the same period, dating back to around 1400 to 1200 BCE.\n\n\"The available data suggest that the cap and bracelet from the Treasure of Villena would currently be the first two pieces attributable to meteoritic iron in the Iberian Peninsula,\" the researchers explain in their paper, \"which is compatible with a Late Bronze chronology, prior to the beginning of the widespread production of terrestrial iron.\"\n\nNow, because the objects are so badly corroded, the results aren't conclusive. But there are more recent, non-invasive techniques that could be applied to the objects to obtain a more detailed set of data that would help cement the findings, the team suggests.\n\nThe findings were published in Trabajos de Prehistoria.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in February 2024.\n\nWorld's Oldest Rock Art Discovered in Indonesian Cave\n\nOne Change to Your Reading Habit Fights Stress And Misinformation\n\nPlaying Video Games Has an Unexpected Effect on Kids' IQ, Study Says",

    "description": "Integrated energy giant Chevron has a strong business, an attractive yield, and a rock-solid balance sheet.",
    "fullText": "Energy is integral to the world, and every investor should probably have some exposure to the sector.\n\nChevron is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies, providing diversification across the energy sector.\n\nChevron offers an attractive combination of yield and financial strength, relative to its closest peers.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›\n\nThe world is trying to shift away from dirtier energy sources, such as coal and oil. However, it's likely to be a long transition. Oil and natural gas will both be needed for decades to come, as the most likely energy strategy is an \"all of the above\" approach.\n\nEvery investor should probably have some exposure to the energy sector. That's the foundational reason why you should consider adding Chevron (NYSE: CVX) to your portfolio. Here are three company-specific reasons why.\n\nThe energy sector is volatile by nature, with oil and natural gas prices rising and falling regularly. You could focus on a narrow niche of the industry, but most investors will be best served by a company with a diversified portfolio of assets that provide exposure to the entire energy value chain. That's what integrated energy companies like Chevron do.\n\nChevron is best known for its oil and natural gas production, which falls into the upstream segment of the industry. However, it also owns energy infrastructure assets, such as pipelines, which help move oil and natural gas around the world.\n\nThat's the midstream. It also owns chemical and refining businesses that operate in the downstream segment of the industry. These businesses process energy into the products that actually get used, like gasoline.\n\nEach segment of the industry operates a little differently through the energy cycle. The best example of the benefit is that low oil prices put pressure on upstream producers but reduce costs in the downstream segment, where oil is a key input into the production of other products. From a foundational perspective, integrated Chevron has an attractive business model.\n\nChevron's dividend yield is currently 4.1%. That's well above the S&P 500 index's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 1.1% yield and the 3.3% yield of the average energy stock. Chevron clearly has an attractive yield on an absolute level.\n\nChevron, however, doesn't have the highest yield among its closest integrated energy peers. That title goes to TotalEnergies at around 5.9%. However, Chevron does have an over 30-year streak of annual dividend increases behind it. That's second in the sector to ExxonMobil's over-40-year streak, but Exxon's yield is only around 3.1%. All in, Chevron is a reliable dividend stock with an attractive yield that stands out from its peers.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — A man accused of offering a $10,000 bounty over Snapchat for the life of a top Border Patrol leader was found not guilty on Thursday in the first criminal trial stemming from the Chicago-area immigration crackdown that started last year.\n\nJurors deliberated less than 4 hours before returning the favorable verdict for 37-year-old Juan Espinoza Martinez. He faced one count of murder-for-hire and up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Testimony lasted mere hours in the federal trial that was the latest test of the Trump administration’s credibility on federal surges that have played out from Minnesota to Maine.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who wore a suit and tie, listened intently with his arms crossed near his stomach. He hugged his attorneys and shook their hands after court adjourned.\n\nAttorneys for the defense declined comment. Prosecutors did not address reporters waiting in the lobby of the federal court in downtown Chicago. Neither did jurors.\n\nAt the heart of the government’s case were Snapchat messages sent from Espinoza Martinez to his younger brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant. One read in part “10k if u take him down,” along with a picture of Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official who has led aggressive crackdowns nationwide, including in the Chicago area.\n\n“Those words do not indicate that this was a joke,” First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Yonan told jurors during Thursday's closing arguments. “Those words have meaning. They are not innocent and harmless words.”\n\nBut defense attorneys said the government didn’t show any evidence against Espinoza Martinez who sent the messages as “neighborhood gossip” after coming home from work and unwinding with beers. He didn’t follow up on the exchanges and had only a few dollars in his bank account.\n\n“Sending a message about gossip that you heard in the neighborhood, it’s not murder for hire,” his defense attorney Dena Singer told jurors. “It’s not a federal crime.”\n\nHer office did not return a message seeking comment after the verdict. Neither did the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago or the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn court, prosecutors accused Espinoza Martinez of being “fixated and obsessed” with Bovino and cited other messages where he criticized the crackdown.\n\nEspinoza Martinez was arrested in October as the city of 2.7 million and surrounding suburbs were seeing a surge of federal immigration officers. Protests and standoffs with agents were common, particularly in the city’s heavily Mexican Little Village neighborhood where Espinoza Martinez lived.\n\nHe did not testify at his trial.\n\nBut attorneys played clips of his interview with law enforcement where he said he was confused about the charges and that he sent the messages without much thought while scrolling social media after work.\n\n“I didn’t threaten anyone,” he told investigators, interchanging English and Spanish at times in the interview. “I’m not saying that I was telling them to do it.”\n\nBorn in Mexico, he’s lived in Chicago for years but doesn’t have citizenship.\n\nDHS touted Espinoza Martinez’s arrest on social media with unredacted photos of his face, referring to him as a “depraved” gang member. Bovino has held the case up as an example of the increasing dangers faced by federal agents. Prosecutors included Yonan, the second-highest ranking federal prosecutor in the Chicago region.\n\nBut several federal lawsuits in Chicago have fueled skepticism about DHS’s narratives. Of the roughly 30 criminal cases stemming from Operation Midway Blitz, charges have been dismissed or dropped in about half. In a notable lawsuit that forced Bovino to sit for depositions, a federal judge found he lied under oath including about alleged gang threats.\n\nBovino did not testify at Espinoza Martinez’s trial.\n\nNationwide, dozens of criminal cases tied to immigration operations have also crumbled.\n\nFederal prosecutors initially referred to Espinoza Martinez as a “ranking member” of the Latin Kings, but their lack of evidence led U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow to bar testimony on the Chicago street gang at trial. According to the criminal complaint, Espinoza Martinez allegedly sent messages on behalf of the gang to other gang members.\n\nAt trial, there were minor mentions of the gang, including Espinoza Martinez saying in his interview that he had nothing to do with the Latin Kings. His brother, Oscar, testified that he took the Snapchat messages as a joke and were something he’d already seen on Facebook.\n\nSinger poked holes in the government’s case, including in the testimony of their first witness Adrian Jimenez.\n\nThe 44-year-old owns a construction company and had been in touch with Espinoza Martinez over Snapchat about work. Unknown to Espinoza Martinez, he had also worked as a paid government informant over the years after serving a prison sentence for a felony. He shared the Snapchats with a federal investigator.\n\nJimenez, who suffers from back problems, walked slowly with a limp to the witness chair and needed help getting up.\n\n“Would you solicit for hire an individual that was in that much pain and could barely walk?” Singer said to jurors. “That doesn’t make any sense.”",

    "fullText": "Dallas will activate its Emergency Operations Center Saturday morning as a winter storm brings freezing temperatures and icy conditions to the region.\n\nCity crews are pre-treating major roads and overpasses, while a massive emergency shelter for up to 900 people will open at Fair Park on Friday.\n\nOfficials urge residents to stay off the roads, protect pipes, and bring pets indoors to avoid accidents and infrastructure damage.\n\nDALLAS - Dallas city leaders on Wednesday announced a comprehensive emergency response plan ahead of a winter storm expected to bring freezing temperatures and icy conditions to the region starting Friday evening.\n\nThe city’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will activate Saturday at 7 a.m. to coordinate public safety, transportation, and infrastructure recovery efforts.\n\n\"Our focus is simple. We want to keep our residents safe,\" the City Manager told reporters during a multi-departmental news conference. \"Our teams have been closely monitoring forecasts to ensure we activate our winter weather operations plan.\"\n\nTransportation and Public Works Director Gus Concarly said the city is taking a \"three-pronged approach,\" including pre-treating bridges and overpasses with brine and sand. Concarly noted that 50 \"ice force\" vehicles are standing by, but warned that residential streets will not be sanded unless requested by emergency responders.\n\nDallas Water Utilities urged residents to wrap exposed pipes and locate their main water shut-off valves. Meanwhile, sanitation officials warned that while Friday collections should proceed as scheduled, garbage and recycling pickups could see significant delays on Monday and Tuesday if road conditions deteriorate.\n\n\"We are well-prepared. This is what we do,\" Justin Ball, Dallas Fire Chief, said during the news conference. \"If you don't want us to be quite as busy, then stay home. That's the advice. Stay home, because there will be a lot of car accidents.\"\n\nTo protect the city’s unsheltered population, an inclement weather shelter will open at Fair Park’s Grand Building starting at 4 p.m. Friday. Kevin Oden, Director of Emergency Management, said the site can accommodate 800 to 900 people, with backup buildings identified if capacity exceeds 75%.\n\nResidents needing transportation to the shelter can call 311 to be picked up by Dallas Street Response Teams.\n\nFire Chief Justin Ball and police officials urged residents to stay off the roads to prevent accidents. Ball also issued a stern warning regarding home heating safety.\n\n\"Don't start warming fires inside the house... no cooking on the balcony,\" Ball said, reminding residents to open fireplace drafts and avoid using candles or outdoor grills indoors if the power goes out.\n\nDallas Animal Services confirmed they will be patrolling 24/7 to respond to reports of animals left in the cold. Under city ordinances, pet owners are required to bring animals indoors during extreme weather.\n\nReflecting on the deadly 2021 winter storm, city leaders emphasized improved coordination and infrastructure. Officials noted that several recreation centers have since been equipped with emergency generators, allowing them to serve as warming stations where residents can charge phones and stay warm if local power grids fail.\n\n\"We have the systems in place to make sure those communication chains... are intact,\" the City Manager said. \"Planning for events like this does not start today.\"\n\nInformation in this article is from the Dallas city leader's news conference on Wednesday.",

    "fullText": "ST. LOUIS – The weekend is creeping closer, and with it, a snowstorm that is projected to dump multiple inches of powder on the FOX 2 viewing area.\n\nWith recent data, confidence is high that the vast majority of our viewing area will see at least four inches of snow, and some counties will see much more than that. Four inches will act as our starting baseline, while our worst-case scenario is closer to a foot of snow, perhaps more by the time the storm ends on Sunday.\n\nIt all depends how the system comes together Saturday evening.\n\nThe weekend system we’re tracking is actually two systems as of Thursday morning—one north of Alaska and the other sitting just off the California coast. We’re working to determine when both pockets of energy will merge, a very intricate process. Even small changes to the when and where or that merger can mess with the alignment of the temperature profile and where precipitation (snow) will form.\n\nThe presence of dry air in the viewing area will play a big role in snow intensity on Saturday, but will have a reduced influence that same evening.\n\nData now more strongly points to a two-wave system. The first wave arrives Saturday and could leave one to three inches of light snow. There will be a break or lull until the evening, when the precipitation becomes light and patchy. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising to see some frizzing drizzle or very fine sleet for several hours between the waves. Not because of the warm/dry air but rather the changing cloud physics between the two. The second wave arrives between 9 p.m. and midnight, with moderate to heavy snowfall into Sunday morning. Light snow may linger into the early afternoon before the system pulls away.\n\nHowever, with a two-wave system, the biggest snowfall totals will come in areas that “double dip” both waves. The greatest overlap is slated for areas along and southeast of Interstate 44 and south of metro St. Louis. We’re projecting six to 10 inches in those areas, centered on a line near Rolla through Park Hills/Farmington and then into Illinois along the Kaskaskia River.\n\nSt. Louis radar: See a map of current weather here\n\nThere could an even heavier band of eight to 12 inches of snow in the far southern viewing area for Reynolds, Iron, and Madison counties in southeast Missouri. The I-70 corridor will get a glancing blow from the first wave but could get the full brunt of the second wave. With more confidence in the track of wave 2, we’re looking at widespread totals of four to eight inches of accumulation across the metro area.\n\nWinds will not be extreme but they will get gusty, with speeds topping 20 to 25 miles per hour, which is going to result in drifting snow, particularly in open and rural areas.\n\nNew data is always rolling in. You can watch us on our smart TV app. FOX2STL+ or the FOX 2 mobile app via the Apple or Google app stores.",
