    "fullText": "WAYNE — At this time last year, Arhip Akhmedov was playing club hockey in Colorado. Since his move to New Jersey and enrolling at St. Joseph (Montvale), Akhmedov had not scored a goal for the Green Knights until the spotlight was brightest.\n\nAkhmedov's shot from inside the blue line 8:14 into overtime lifted the Green Knights over Don Bosco, 2-1, on Jan. 22 for the program's second consecutive Bergen County Tournament championship.\n\nA fast and physical game from start to finish, Don Bosco pressured St. Joseph early in the first period, but surrendered the game's first goal on the first shot of the night from the Green Knights. Jason Juneau poked a puck into the crease and past Alex Annunziato for a 1-0 lead 2:12 into the game.\n\nDon Bosco led wire to wire in shots on goal, but were held off the scoreboard until a second period goal by Niko Pappachristou to tie the game at one. The game would remain tied for another 30 minutes of game play until Akhmedov's game-winner.\n\nThe tournament final marked the third time this season that Don Bosco and St. Joseph faced off with all three games ending in 2-1 finals. Don Bosco won the first two matchups on Dec. 4 and Jan. 16.\n\nPending any upsets in the postseason, there's likelihood that the two schools will face off at least one more time. Don Bosco and St. Joseph could be heading for a fourth encounter during the upcoming Gordon Cup playoffs with a fifth game even possible in the state's Non-Public playoffs set to kick off in February.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: St. Joe’s Montvale NJ hockey repeats as Bergen County champ in OT win",

    "fullText": "LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) – Waverly basketball has started the season with a 9-2 record, including a win against Lansing Sexton in the “Battle for Michigan Ave.” The Warriors’ success has earned them our Team of the Week award.\n\nSenior leadership is one of the biggest reasons for Waverly’s success so far this season, according to Waverly basketball coach Rod Watts. Derek Thomas II had a team-high 28 points in their win over Lansing Sexton on Saturday. Xavier Pendergrass finished with 17 points.\n\nWatts described Thomas and Pendergrass as forces in the paint and how important it is for his team to feed them early, to establish dominance and get his two playmakers going.\n\n“When you don’t feed the guys inside, they get frustrated and we get frustrated and I get frustrated,” explained Watts. “They may tend not to work for you, so got to feed them early and I think the outside will open up. So this is one of the things got to focus on.”\n\nWaverly is currently on a five-game winning streak and Thomas says he feels this is just the tip of the iceberg for how good he feels his team can be.\n\n“We had dropped two, so going on this win streak to start the year of 2026, it feels really good,” said Thomas. “We feel like we have our best games ahead of us.”\n\nWaverly will look to make it six wins in a row when they face Lansing Everett on January 23rd at 7:00p.m.",

    "fullText": "Over his 23 years in the NBA, LeBron James has had many rivals who have tried to get under his skin. However, arguably, none of them have been as successful in recent history as Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks, a hard-nosed defensive specialist with erratic habits, someone who has consistently gotten a reaction out of the King. Now, Brooks has publicly addressed his tactics.\n\n“If this was LeBron, maybe five years ago, then it’d be different,” Brooks said about James to Twitch streamer Agent during a recent appearance on his livestream. “Miami Bron, you’re not really talking shit to him for real, cause then it’s like, blow by, dunk. He’s got more game to him, more agile. Right now, he’s like, like I’ve always been saying, he’s old.”\n\nFor Brooks, it’s clear that trash talk is just one more tactic that he uses as a part of his defensive identity, and a situational way to disrupt rhythm and force opposing stars into emotionally engage with him. Whether that approach is criticized or lauded has never seemed much to matter to him.\n\nWith the Phoenix Suns, even as he experiences as increased offensive role which averaging career-highs across the board, Brooks’ defensive edge hasn’t softened. He presented his mindset as preparation, something he’s seen doing frequently before games, and a belief that every aspect of his opponent’s temperament and limitations factor into being able to stop them on defense.\n\n“You can press up on him,” Brooks continued on James. “You can cut him off spots so you know his moves he’s going to do. So you can always chirp a little bit. For some reason, he likes to do a little chirping… I got like quick twitch back.”\n\nWhen the Phoenix Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers met earlier this season, the tension between LeBron James and Dillon brooks was evident throughout the game. Brooks drew the James assignment for most of the game, playing extremely physically, crowding his space and talking throughout the night as the matchup felt almost playoff-like in it’s edge.\n\nOne key possession highlighted the double-edged approach of Brooks’ tactics. With just over 12 seconds left in the game, the Suns forward drilled a go-ahead three right in James’ face, seemingly validating his approach.\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, James seemingly rolled over Brooks, resulting in a no-call, causing the two to get briefly entangled. Brooks was quickly assessed his second technical following this exchange and was ejected, a sequence that eventually snowballed into handing the Lakers a win from the late advantage.\n\nLooking back, this game clearly reads as a real-time example of everything Brooks talked about on stream with Agent. He pressed up on James, cut off his preferred spots, leaned into constant chatter, and while James ultimately sealed the win late, the exchange highlighted why every matchup between the two is primetime.\n\nBrooks isn’t just challenging perhaps the greatest player in league history, but actively pushing the margins of engaging against superstars.\n\nThe post Dillon Brooks Takes Aim at Aging LeBron James While Explaining Trash Talk Tactics appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "LAKELAND —There were three Polk County high school cheer state runner ups in this year's FHSAA 2026 Competitive Cheerleading State Championships Thursday at the RP Funding Center in Lakeland.\n\nBartow, Lakeland and George Jenkins all achieved the feat. For Bartow, the Yellow Jackets won it in the Large Co-ed, while Lakeland was in the Large Non-Tumbling, and George Jenkins racked it up in Medium Co-ed.\n\nBartow was able to execute a pyramid, among other displays. Overall, their cheer was exceptional and précised, helping the program to tack on a 76.70.\n\n\"I feel like this performance was to show they had the confidence (on) what they were doing for this whole season. We had a lot of ups and downs. We stuck together and this group that we have really loves this sport. Today was just to go out there, show people that you love it, and you been doing this months on months. Just give them what you know. This is Bartow, so just show them,\" Bartow head cheer coach Jovon Penny said after the competition.\n\nRegionals: Polk County cheer teams qualify for state, top regional performances\n\nLake Gibson: Here's how Lake Gibson cheer changed a Polk County trend\n\nPenny said for nationals, he needs the team to focus on hitting before moving on to the hard moves.\n\nLakeland — a team that won three straight national titles — also strives for the basics. And in their performance, they were able to execute their first stunt well and like Bartow, their cheer was spirited, though the pyramid and the second stunt had some bobbles, which still led to an 86.50 score.\n\n\"It was a lot of fight. It wasn't the performance we had in regionals. ... Regionals was a really good performance,\" Lakeland head coach Crystal Abdon said.\n\nGeorge Jenkins scored 86.4, which was better than a performance in regionals in which the program had three falls. And the only team that had higher score was Strawberry Crest, which scored the most points (92.70) in all divisions. In order to achieve the program's first runner-up finish in the co-ed division — just the second year the program is in the division — the flying Eagles registered a hit\n\n\"I feel incredible. We haven't hit at a comp all season, so to finish with a hit is all we can ask for. I told the kids, regardless what happens, as long we focus ... then that was a win, and they more than did that tonight. So we are super happy. It's a win for us no matter what happens,\" George Jenkins head cheer coach Kiley Viggiano-Ramsuer said.\n\nWinter Haven in the Small Varsity division managed a 66.8 score and a seventh-place finish after the safety violation ― a situation in which a spotter was in the wrong place, which deducted a point. Still, the Blue Devils displayed back hand spring ups, hand-to-hand inversions, low to high and high to high switches, as well as a shotgun in the pyramid.\n\n\"I am very proud because the team hit a very difficult and new pyramid,\" Winter Haven head cheer coach Ali Roberts said. \"It felt good to compete at states this year because last year, we did not advance to states.\"\n\nLake Gibson was sixth with an 83.50 in the Gameday division, which was the biggest division there was this year. The Braves, though, needed to go through 13 different teams before advancing to finals to compete against 10 teams.\n\n\"Overall, our team's culture was great, which I beleive resulted in us making it as far as we did. I'm a very proud coach,\" Lake Gibson head cheer coach Jezyiah DeShazor said.\n\nLake Wales in Small Non-Tumbling placed fifth with a 74.70.\n\n\"Our performance today did not go as we hoped. Back to work these next two weeks as we chase the hit feeling to end our season together at high school nationals,\" Lake Wales head cheer coach Brandi Kehres said.\n\nAnd Auburndale was eighth in the same division with a 69.60.\n\nDay 2 is Friday. And nationals is set for Feb. 7-10 at ESPN's Wide World of Sports in Orlando.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Ledger: Bartow, Lakeland, George Jenkins finish as state runners-up at state cheer; Polk results",

    "fullText": "Hailie Deegan isn’t playing it safe as she is set to make her return to NASCAR with a bold mission, and that is to challenge Danica Patrick’s long-held grip on NASCAR history\n\nFor more than a decade, Danica Patrick has been the only woman to have found much success in NASCAR. The 24-year old is officially returning to her roots, confirming she will pilot the No.16 Chevrolet in the ARCA Menards Series West. But what’s more impressive is the goal she has set for her 2026 season. While taking a few notes from Patrick’s notebook would be helpful, Deegan is busy charting out her own ambitious path.\n\nSpeaking on her YouTube channel, Hailie Deegan sounded more determined than ever.\n\n“Obviously, the championship is on my mind,” she said. “I feel like it’s a year-long battle, but when it comes to those kinds of smaller goals that I have, more short-term ones, is to win four races. It’d be really cool to be the first female to win a NASCAR championship. So that would be huge for me.”\n\nTo be the first female champion in NASCAR would definitely be a dream come true, and it would especially mean surpassing what Danica Patrick has managed to achieve in the male-dominated sport.\n\nDanica Patrick has shattered barriers throughout her racing career by achieving several historic firsts that no woman had before in NASCAR.\n\nIn 2013, she became the first woman ever to win a pole position in the NASCAR Cup Series by setting the fastest lap and qualifying for the Daytona 500, a feat that marked the highest starting point for a female driver and NASCAR’s premier division.\n\nThat same year at Daytona, she also became the first woman to lead laps, guiding her car to the front of the field and finishing it, the best result by a woman in that race’s history at the time.\n\nOn NASCAR, Patrick’s trailblazing extended to open-wheel racing as well. Earlier in her career, she became the first woman to lead laps in the Indianapolis 500 and went on to become the first woman to win a major IndyCar race, triumphing at the Indy 300 in 2008.\n\nHowever, a championship has always been out of her grass and that is where Hailie Deegan steps in. Deegan wants to achieve the same and more. However, it will require a lot of practice and a lot more patience.\n\nDeegan’s NASCAR journey has been far from smooth sailing. After a failed experiment with IndyCar, the 24-year-old struggled to get on NASCAR seat.\n\nShe was racing for HMD Motorsports in the 2025 Indy NXT season. But the California native, who is unable to perform her best and ended her stint in the series with a P14 finish in the drivers’ championship, is a far cry from what she expected.\n\nMoreover, she was hosted from her Xfinity seat all of a sudden in 2024. It definitely left her with a lot of regret.\n\nOver 69 truck series starts, Deegan managed just five top 10 finishes. Our conference took another hit after a difficult 2025 season in IndyCar. However, she is not done yet. Deegan is ready to reset and rebuild, and she has chosen to do it when she first program ourselves, back in the ARCA West Series.\n\nDeegan has shown she can win in the NASCAR lower division. She captured three ARCA West victories in 2018, 2019, and 2020. She ran a season in the series, finishing third in the standings despite winning that year.\n\nAnd now with her résumé and grit, a championship may not seem too far, but only time will tell if she achieves the ultimate goal.\n\nDeegan’s return to NASCAR with Bill McAnally Racing and NAPA is a headline-making move that has thrust her back into the spotlight, and the demo couldn’t be happier.\n\nA decision to return to the ARCA Series is a major development, and it could be the research she needs to rebuild momentum. More importantly, Bill McAnally was quick to express his excitement about the 24-year-old joining the lineup and what it means for the 2026 plans.\n\nFor McAnally, bringing Deegan back feels like returning to a familiar chapter. He spoke fondly of their past partnership, highlighting the success they shared in the bins they collected along the way.\n\nHe also made it clear that her return would boost the team’s championship hope especially with Mason Massey also competing for the title.\n\n“Having Hailie back on our team is incredibly special. We enjoyed working together several years ago and won some races,” he said. “I see the commitment she has for competing at this level, and we want to be part of her success. She has the knowledge of winning out West, and we have a great chance to chase our 12th title with her and Mason Massey in the fold.”\n\nWith 2026 on the horizon, Deegan’s return also highlights the growing presence of women in a traditionally male-dominated sport. More female drivers competing at the highest levels of stock car racing not only push the sport to greater equality but also add new rivalries and fresh energy to the track. Her comeback could inspire other women to chase their own NASCAR dreams and prove that success in racing is not limited by gender.\n\nThe post Hailie Deegan Targets Danica Patrick’s Long-Standing NASCAR Grip With Bold 2026 Goal appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

While they wear different uniforms, respect is all the Diamondbacks shortstop has for the Dodgers superstar.\n\n“Ohtani’s my brother,” Perdomo said. “That guy is out of this league, Ohtani’s out of this league.” (Translated from Spanish to English)\n\nSep 25, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani (17) at bat in the seventh inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field. Mandatory Credit: Allan Henry-Imagn Images\n\nPerdomo shared a story involving the reigning National League MVP from last season, detailing an exchange that highlighted both competition and camaraderie. After picking up a few Japanese phrases from a team trainer, Perdomo approached Ohtani and asked him for a signed bat.\n\n“He understood,” Perdomo recalled. “And he said, ‘If I win and get you out.'”\n\nThe Diamondbacks ultimately won the game, with Perodmo hitting the walk-off hit in the victory against Los Angeles. Despite “losing” the bet, Perdomo continued to express his awe for Ohtani’s elite talent.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers pitcher Shohei Ohtani (17) throws to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first inning at Chase Field in Phoenix on Sept. 23, 2025. © Rob Schumacher / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nOhtani doesn’t just paint corners, but also has a blazing fastball that can hit 100 mph. With a mixed arsenal at his disposal, hitters are left guessing all the time.\n\n“I was shocked when Vladdy hit a home run against him, and Vladdy is Vladdy,” Perdomo said, referring to Toronto Blue Jays star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. “With runners on base, he’s quick to the plate. Your timing has to be quick.”\n\nPerdomo’s comments reflect the intersection of rivalry and admiration that has come to define Ohtani’s presence in MLB. Even as division rivals who play high-intensity games each year at Chase Field and Dodger Stadium, moments like these show how players balance competition with mutual respect through friendly banter and bets.\n\nAug 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Arizona Diamondbacks infielder Geraldo Perdomo scores in the first inning triple against the Cincinnati Reds at Chase Field. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nOhtani’s reach is global. Often portrayed as serious and businesslike, he continues to leave an impact far beyond the field. Even without frequent trips to the desert, being part of a story that connects Arizona to the Dominican Republic underscores how his influence stretches across cultures and borders.\n\nWhile Perdomo may not have his signed Ohtani bat — yet — his respect for the reigning NL MVP serves as a reminder that baseball rivalries often transcend competition and ultimately give way to admiration.\n\n“What Ohtani does, no one else does,” Perdomo said. “As long as he’s playing and keeps putting up the numbers he does, nobody’s going to win an MVP. No one.”\n\n‘His joy is back’: Suns’ Jalen Green makes his long-awaited return in Philly",

    "fullText": "Manchester United will part ways with star midfielder Casemiro at the end of the current campaign, creating a gaping hole at the heart of Michael Carrick’s engine room.\n\nDespite his occasional ups and downs since joining the club from Real Madrid in the summer of 2022, the 33-year-old has quickly become one of the fan favourites at Old Trafford.\n\nUnited paid Los Merengues a whopping £60 million to sign the five-time UEFA Champions League winner, while handing the player an eye-watering £350,000-a-week contract.\n\nHowever, it paid off as Casemiro helped the Red Devils lift the 2023 League Cup trophy with a match-winning performance before guiding them to the 2024 FA Cup triumph.\n\nCasemiro’s tenacity and combative nature, combined with a knack for scoring decisive goals, have turned him into a cornerstone of Man Utd’s midfield in recent seasons.\n\nUnfortunately, the time has come for the Brazil captain to wave goodbye to the Theatre of Dreams, with the player announcing his departure at the end of the season.\n\nWith the former Madrid stalwart on his way out, it’s up to the club to find a suitable successor, a challenge made even tougher by the pressure of securing a top-four finish.\n\nHere, we look at five potential replacements for the Old Trafford faithful’s cult hero.\n\nDespite Atalanta’s notable downfall in the wake of Gian Piero Gasperini’s departure, Ederson remains one of the most highly rated midfielders in Serie A.\n\nInter Milan had tried to lure him away from Bergamo last summer but to no avail, as La Dea’s £55m asking price blew the Nerazzurri out of the water, opening the door for a potential Premier League move.\n\nAt 26, Ederson is at his peak powers, but it’s questionable whether he would be a fitting candidate to fill Casemiro’s shoes despite their shared nationality and similar styles of play.\n\nEven the bookmakers view the former Salernitana man as an outsider in the race to replace the Brazilian veteran in Manchester.\n\nEmerging as a household name at Crystal Palace, Adam Wharton is one of the most sought-after midfielders on the market, with a queue of clubs eager to acquire his services.\n\nPriced at 15/2 to join Man Utd in the summer, Wharton has generated plenty of interest, as Real Madrid and Liverpool are also hot on his trail, with Tottenham Hotspur lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe 21-year-old has become famous for his tactical intelligence and elegance, and there’s no doubt that he would be an immediate upgrade on United’s current midfield options.\n\nPalace could be inclined to let him leave for a reported fee of £65m.\n\nNottingham Forest’s first European season in the 21st century has plunged the club’s domestic campaign into chaos, with the Tricky Trees languishing in the Premier League’s lower reaches since the opening weekend.\n\nWhile things have not gone their way, Elliot Anderson remains a rare shining light at the City Ground, as the 23-year-old continues to impress with his energy, technical quality and willingness to take responsibility in midfield.\n\nAnderson is already an established Premier League star and is likely to play a prominent role for England at the upcoming FIFA World Cup after becoming a first-team regular for Thomas Tuchel’s side.\n\nMeanwhile, several English clubs have taken note of his progress in West Bridgford, with Chelsea and Manchester City reportedly set to rival Man Utd for his services.\n\nThe former Newcastle United ace won’t come cheap, with Forest slapping a prohibitive £100m price tag on their most prized asset.\n\nCasemiro’s exit could lure the Carrington academy graduate, James Garner, back to his boyhood club after an impressive four-year stint at Everton, where he has established himself as an elite midfielder.\n\nWhile the Toffees are desperate to tie the 24-year-old down to a new long-term contract, a call from Man Utd could throw a spanner in the works, though the Red Devils must act quickly.\n\nIn addition to United, Aston Villa and Newcastle are also interested in the Englishman, who has made 22 league appearances for David Moyes’ side this season, racking up two goals and three assists.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting name on United’s shortlist is that of Eduardo Camavinga, who could be counting his final months at Stadio Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nLow in the pecking order, Camavinga is ready to pack his bags, with Chelsea emerging as his potential destination amid Madrid’s alleged interest in Enzo Fernandez, via El Nacional.\n\nHowever, Man Utd could spoil the Blues’ hopes of including the Frenchman in a high-profile swap deal now that they desperately need a long-term solution in the middle of the park.\n\nArticle republished with permission from OldTraffordFaithful.com.",

    "title": "Fiorentina vs Cagliari: Preview",
    "description": "The Viola try to make it 5 straight without defeat, which is a small goal but also one that was unthinkable a month ago.",
    "fullText": "Fiorentina has a chance to haul itself out of the relegation places at the expense of a rival for the drop this weekend when Cagliari (15th place with 22 points) comes to town, although the Sardinians are coming off a high following a win over Juventus last time out. The match will be played on Saturday, 24 January 2026, at 17:00 GMT/12:00 PM EST, at the Stadio Artemio Franchi in beautiful Firenze. The forecast calls for a fairly warm evening but potentially a rainy one.\n\nOne of the best dynamics over the past month or so has been the Paris-Dodô pairing on the right. They’ve regularly swapped positions and roles, with either one happy jetting infield while the other holds the width, and their mind meld has given opposing defenses a lot of headaches. Manor Solomon—the obvious replacement now that Parisi’s out for a couple weeks with a hamstring issue—probably won’t have that level of chemistry with Dodô right away, and as a right-footed player, he might not be as comfortable cutting inside.\n\nTo replicate Parisi’s impact, Solomon has two main tasks (you know, besides playing well). The first is to offer Dodô some cover. The fullback has been back to his best over the past few weeks, raiding forward to great effect, and that requires the winger ahead of him to sacrifice at times. If Solomon stays high and wide, it will fall to Rolando Mandragora to shuffle into that space, where Cagliari will target him on the break with the more athletic Semih Kiliçsoy. It’s not the funnest thing for a winger but the defensive side will be important.\n\nThe second task is width. Because Parisi’s left-footed, he naturally turns towards the center of the pitch. In contrast, the Solomon might stick to going down the line. If that’s the case, keeping him higher up out of possession might be a viable strategy to stretch Cagliari’s defense horizontally and open space for Roberto Piccoli. Part of Dodô‘s recent improvement has been Parisi opening space for the overlap, so if Solomon’s always hugging the touchline, Dodô will have to cut infield a lot. He can do that to good effect but he’s best in the wide areas, particularly in the final third.\n\nI harp on this ahead of every game and end up disappointed every time. Fiorentina has conceded 10 of 32 goals from set pieces, which is the highest proportion in Serie A. While that may seem to have improved of late, it’s more about opponent finishing than any improvements in that area. Part of it is that the Viola defense is just bad in the air (2nd-most headed goals conceded). Part of it is David de Gea staying glued to his line at all times rather than coming for the ball.\n\nMarin Pongračić (much improved of late in general) is curiously bad in the air, which means the only average-to-above average aerial defenders on the team are Pietro Comuzzo, Robin Gosens, and maybe Cher Ndour and Roberto Piccoli. That’s a personnel issue which Paolo Vanoli can’t fix with any amount of drilling. He can try to minimize fouls in dangerous areas but that’s mitigation rather than solution. Maybe a radically different defensive strategy is the fix: instead of sitting deep in the box, for example, push everyone higher up and disrupt opponents’ timing at set pieces. That’s one example. There are other options too. But something’s got to change.\n\nI love Yerry Mina because he’s a box office defender, bursting at the seams with personality and always up to something. I’m sorry it didn’t work out in Florence for him but at least he gave everyone (except Josh Zirkzee’s nipple) some memories. He’s the sort of lumbering, lovable defender that always endears themselves to a fan base for his willingness to enact violence and his humor in doing so.\n\nAnd here, he’ll be up against Albert Guðmundsson. I can’t think of a greater contrast in physical force and I’m intrigued to see how it pans out: Guðmundsson’s quick enough to run circles around him but Mina could simply overpower the Viola winger. Either way, expect the big Colombian to go deep into his bag of tricks to deal with a speedier, wispier opponent.\n\nThe bookies lean towards Fiorentina pretty heavily, from what I can tell. In fact, I’d say too heavily, given the relative positions in the table. Cagliari’s coming off a massive win and is the exact sort of team that gives the Viola trouble. I don’t want to dismiss the momentum Vanoli and company have built up over the past month but the team still feels very fragile to me. The hosts are certainly favorites but those odds are tilted towards them too much if you’re actually planning to bet real money.\n\nI’m not so I predict a 2-1 Fiorentina win. Cagliari leads Serie A in yellow cards and is 2nd in total fouls so don’t expect a beautiful game as the visitors sit deep and try to counter attack. I feel like we’re due a Mandragora banger so I’ll tap him for the opener, with Gosens adding a second with a header. Facing a 2-goal deficit, Fabio Pisacane will throw on an extra striker and the Viola will wilt under the bombardment, eventually conceding late to Mina (of course) to set up a tense finish. With both Andrea Belotti and Michael Folorunsho out, though, the Sardinians won’t have enough reti di ex to tie it up.",

    "description": "Jason Williams inbox: Baltimore and Buffalo fired highly successful coaches. Does it make Bengals look worse for sticking with Zac Taylor?",
    "fullText": "Ask columnist Jason Williams anything − sports or non-sports – and he’ll pick some of your questions and comments from his inbox and respond on Cincinnati.com. Email: jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nMessage: John Harbaugh won a Super Bowl in Baltimore. He won eight road playoff games over 18 seasons there, something no other coach has done. He still got fired.\n\nSean McDermott made Buffalo a regular contender in the AFC, at one point going six straight seasons of winning at least one playoff game. He still got fired.\n\nAnd yet Zac Taylor remains the Bengals’ head coach after missing the playoffs three straight years. Don’t you think all these firings of top coaches makes the Bengals look even worse for keeping Zac?\n\nReply: Guess it depends on the audience. It looks bad to the national media, which can’t accept that the Bengals aren’t like everyone else in how they operate. Here at home, we’re conditioned to accept Bengals mediocrity and so most people don’t think it looks all that bad.\n\nBig picture, the moves in Baltimore and Buffalo highlight that the Bengals’ standards aren’t congruent with the AFC’s elite franchises. You already knew that, but it’s just another reminder that some teams have a whole other level of expectations – a level that’s hard to comprehend around here.\n\nBaltimore and Buffalo are legitimately trying to win a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Bengals ownership is happy if the team is competitive and finishes with a winning record. Did you notice that Bengals owner Mike Brown pointed out the “four straight winning seasons” in the first sentence of his statement early this month? Well, two of those ended with no playoff berth.\n\nThat said, I’m glad Taylor didn’t get fired. The team’s failures aren’t his fault. Taylor can only do so much with the inadequate players that ownership and the front office keep giving him.\n\nAnd there is something to be said about being patient with a coach. It’s a tough balancing act, but Taylor did oversee the best two-year stretch in team history – and it wasn’t that long ago.\n\nThe notion of firing a coach after one bad season is crazy, like the Ravens did with Harbaugh. On one hand, you like the message that mediocrity won’t cut it. On the other, though, it’s a cautionary tale to be careful what you wish for. It’ll be incredibly difficult for new Baltimore coach Jesse Minter to match Harbaugh’s success, let alone top it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Baltimore, Buffalo go for Super Bowl excellence as Bengals stay same",

    "fullText": "Editor’s note: This article contains spoilers for each series of the UK and U.S. editions of The Traitors\n\nThe winner of the fourth series of Traitors UK will not be the psychologist, either of the two barristers — one turned bestselling crime author — or the retired police detective.\n\nThe wild irony of The Traitors, the final of which will be aired on the BBC this evening, is that a social deduction game based around reading people, gathering evidence, and presenting a case never seems to favour people who have spent a career building those skills.\n\nThe aforementioned detective got the whole thing so spectacularly wrong that the only player she pledged her trust to was a traitor.\n\nHow can you look away? Almost 12 million people watched the series four premiere in the UK this month, and the U.S. fourth season has already beaten the premiere of season three. Outwardly, Traitors is a game of deception — the titular ‘traitors’ must eliminate the ‘faithfuls’, by murder and manipulation, while faithfuls must hunt out the traitors and vote to banish them — but it is really a proving ground for every soft skill ever listed on LinkedIn.\n\nEach year, contestants from scores of different industries — diplomacy, medicine, politics, military, teaching — profess theirs has equipped them best to succeed on a show which offers a cash prize to the winning contestant. Which raises the question: how well would football prepare you for the Traitors?\n\nThere are parallels between both, according to Traitors UK series one contestant Dr Amos Ogunkoya, a GP and sports medicine doctor who was previously the club doctor at Luton Town (then in the Premier League) and Colchester United.\n\n“When you’re in the castle, there’s so much noise,” he told The Athletic. “Everyone is throwing out theories. (The edit) focuses on one or two, but there are 10, 30, 50 every day.\n\n“You have to trust your gut a lot more. When you’re working in the Premier League, I can’t explain to you how much noise there is. It’s global noise, and inside, everyone’s got people in their ear. Comfort in that noise and comfort in who you are is really important.\n\n“Football environments are difficult things because, especially at the higher level, they induce — quite similar to The Traitors — a level of paranoia. For a lot of people at the top level, there’s a lot of competition: is (there) someone else in the shadows that wants to take that position from you? The people who rise to the top tend to be the people whom people like.\n\n“The best faithfuls are the ones who adopt the siege mentality. It’s almost like a relegation scrap: ‘We know who we are, and everyone thinks we’re stupid, and everyone thinks we’re gonna go down’. That’s the best way you quickly suss out who’s on your side. I probably got murdered because I was (valuing) cohesion and leadership.”\n\nSuch is the cruelty of The Traitors, the game does not always reward those players the audience perceives as having worked the hardest.\n\nContestants must constantly walk the tightrope between self-preservation and confrontation. Some, like faithful Harriet in UK series 4, swiftly go in two-footed with their accusations, while others hide their suspicions from the traitors to stay in the game. That exercise in diplomacy — how and when to speak — takes place every day in dressing rooms up and down the country.\n\n“Sometimes, there’s no other option other than to go for someone and really say: ‘That’s not on, you’re not behaving in the right way’,” said Wales Women centurion Helen Ward, now head of women’s football at Watford. “You have to bring it up, particularly if you are captain or head coach. You’ve got a responsibility to the rest of the group to call it out.\n\n“I’ve really been lucky to have some brilliant team-mates, but there’s always the occasion where you think: what are they doing behind my back? If it’s another striker, are they trying to bring me down to other people to make themselves look better?\n\n“There’s competition for places, but then there’s being a little bit sneaky about it.\n\n“You know they’re doing things to elevate their own career, and that maybe comes with some behaviours that not everybody would necessarily agree with or do themselves. That certainly would come up from time to time in teams. If you’ve been around that and you’ve picked up on things that people do when they think no one’s watching, that could be a trait that lends itself well to solving The Traitors.”\n\nJake Brown, winner of UK series three, attributed his victory in part to skills gained as a Para Lion with the England cerebral palsy football team. Brown represented England at European and world championships and trained at England’s base at St George’s Park in Staffordshire. That ingrained consistency was crucial in the show, he said.\n\n“If you change your behaviour or character a lot, that’s often seen as traitor behaviour,” he said. “I always used to think: one day, be loud; one day, be quiet. I was trying to get that see-saw balance.\n\n“One of my managers at England used to tell me: ‘KISS — Keep it simple, stupid’. I took that saying into the castle with me. The first couple of days: don’t do anything complicated. Normally, the first thing you think about is the best. That saying goes on the football pitch: the first pass or the first action you see is normally the best course of action.\n\n“When people start to get banished and murdered, that’s when you need to think outside the box, and think a couple of days ahead. If I say this, how will people react? If you’re saying something without a long-term goal in mind, you might get caught out.”\n\nCoaches and managers, of course, must be alert to the moment the courage of their convictions tips into delusion. By the same token, the most galling reverse came in the UK final of The Celebrity Traitors. Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed formed an early alliance with former England rugby union player Joe Marler based on their shared suspicions of comedian and traitor Alan Carr, only to falter and banish Marler at the final round table in favour of Carr.\n\n“My jaw dropped when that happened,” said Jay Sadler, the head coach of WSL 2 side Portsmouth Women. “I couldn’t believe he changed and switched on someone that he formed an alliance with.\n\n“Elite managers have that strength in their convictions and they know exactly what they’re chasing. Sometimes, you look and think, do we stick? Do we need to have more adaptability to win? I’d rather look back and be glad I made a bold move that I felt strategically was the right one than stick with the same, hoping for a different result.\n\n“The difference is I’ve got a multidisciplinary team that I can lean on — analysts and assistant coaches that I know are here for the right reasons. Can you trust everyone on The Traitors? That’s why I think you have to be a little bit more cut-throat with sticking to your own game and your own guns than in football. If you are going off limited information, stick to what you know and stick to your gut.”\n\nThe most galling example of misplaced trust came in the UK series two finale, when disability model Mollie Pearce’s friendship with traitor and eventual winner Harry Clark won out over a more logical alliance with faithful Jaz Singh.\n\n“The interesting thing is they all think, after being together for three or four days, that they know each other inside out,” said Stephen Warnock, the former Liverpool and Blackburn defender turned BBC and Sky pundit.\n\n“You haven’t got a clue who you’re talking to, but people do get blinkers on and forget it’s a game. That’s the one thing that footballers would definitely remember, and I think they’d be quite cut-throat if it meant axing someone or calling someone out. The other side of it is if you had someone who is an ex-captain or a senior player going into the Traitors, they could be seen as a little bit bossy, commanding and trying to lead people. That could be seen as a positive or a negative.”\n\nWarnock pointed out that footballers may have years together compared to the weeks Traitors contestants spend in the Scottish castle. That makes for a more delicate and significant balancing of emotions. Equally, football coaches tread a constant line: building an honest environment while protecting the group, which sometimes necessitates a kind of deception.\n\n“What I’ve learned now is that football management is a bit like acting,” continued Sadler. “You’re going up in front of the cameras and the media want to talk to you, but you already know what you want to tell them — you just manipulate whatever questions are asked and give the answer that you want to portray to the players, staff, and stakeholders.\n\n“The biggest thing in leadership is being honest and being able to build trust. Deception kind of conflicts with that. (In the game), the balance will be key.”\n\nIt is rare that a post-game interview will be as confrontational as a Traitors roundtable, but journalists must be able to ask the hard questions while preserving long-term relationships.\n\n“With football, you know it is just a game, but when it starts getting nasty, or things aren’t going their way, (managers) are still people, so it’s a fine line to tread,” said Sky Sports presenter Michelle Owen.\n\n“(With) The Traitors, I can’t believe this year how there have been so many things (discussed at the roundtable) and then the next day, no one mentions them. You need to bank stuff in your memory. In our job, those little things are so important.”\n\nUltimately, though, The Traitors remains such a difficult show to navigate. Everyone thinks they’re good at reading people until somebody proves them wrong — a bad business partner, a dishonest spouse — and those instincts are tested in a game whose premise often feels illogical.\n\n“You have to be comfortable being wrong,” said Ogunkoya, which sums up the irony of the game. “In any professional sport, you make mistakes, adjust and you don’t have an ego when it comes to it. People can go in (the show) and think they’re good at reading people, become really rigid, and that makes them easy to trick.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSoccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs remain one of the most impressive teams this season. On Thursday, they got their 31st win of the season on the back of a well-rounded night against the Utah Jazz.\n\nHead coach Mitch Johnson is glad to see how the team is performing, especially with Keldon Johnson serving as a leader. The 26-year-old forward has been with the team since 2019, making him the team's longest-tenured active player.\n\nWhile Johnson is still young at 26, he has become a huge figurehead in San Antonio. Most of the players look up to him as a leader because he has a good demeanor about him, but he has a naturally friendly personality.\n\nThat was most evident when he agreed to shave his head alongside Victor Wembanyama. It has been an interesting season for the Spurs, and that is mostly due to Wembanyama's excellence, but Johnson's leadership should not be discounted.\n\nMORE:Victor Wembanyama was glad he and Spurs teammate Keldon Johnson shaved their heads\n\nCoach Johnson has also been with the team for a long time, despite this being his second season at the helm. Throughout the years together, the head coach has seen Keldon develop into a reliable player and leader.\n\n\"Keldon is a prime example for every player, but especially young player, kids out there that he's making as many mistakes as everybody,\" Mitch said about Keldon after beating the Jazz.\n\n\"But his energy and his effort and his competitiveness and his multiple efforts to get to the next thing is at such a high level that it allows him to find a rhythm and find himself in the middle of plays.\"\n\nWith that kind of reliability, it makes sense that Keldon continues to be one of the most important players on the Spurs roster. He might not have eye-popping stats, but he has an intrinsic value on the Spurs roster.\n\nMoving forward, the rest of the Spurs will continue to progress. They will know that Keldon Johnson will be quite a reliable player and presence for the team.\n\nSpurs' Victor Wembanyama stats since shaving head bald are pretty much unstoppable\n\nWhy Wemby is bald after shaving head with Spurs teammate\n\nVictor Wembanyama responds to Anthony Edwards wish to dunk on him one day\n\nSpurs former lottery pick cited as potential trade candidate\n\nSpurs fans think Victor Wembanyama recruited Giannis Antetokounmpo live on camera because of a misleading post",

    "description": "Specific Washington Commanders' jerseys are on clearance, which means the old look could become the permanent new look.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to quarterback Jayden Daniels, it became cool to buy Washington Commanders NFL jerseys in 2024. Every time the NFL released a different Daniels' jersey, whether it was the black alternate, the new Super Bowl era jerseys they brought back in 2025, or Salute to Service, they were a big hit.\n\nNow, if you're looking to buy a Daniels' jersey — or any Washington jersey outside of the Super Bowl era throwbacks, you can find them on clearance.\n\nNo, it's not because the Commanders were 5-12 in 2025. Or because fans are still protesting over the name. Instead, it's because Washington's current jerseys will be going away in 2026. The Super Bowl-era throwbacks will likely become the Commanders' permanent uniforms.\n\nX user Zach Cohen often posts on NFL uniforms and designs and released the following video on Thursday:\n\nLet's do this one better... only 4 NFL teams have similarly discounted jerseys on all current players online & in-person at Dick's 🚨\n- Commanders: all except white \"throwbacks\"\n- Falcons: all except black throwbacks\n- Ravens: all \n- Titans: all\n\nNot only are those 4 teams I… https://t.co/kAR7LXDwVB pic.twitter.com/5EIqAMYsd4\n\n— Zach Cohen (@ZachCohenFB) January 22, 2026\n\nCohen is often spot-on when reporting about jerseys and uniforms. And he's right about the discounted price on Commanders' jerseys on Fanatics.\n\nThe Commanders' jerseys were introduced in 2022 when they changed their name. They've never been popular. The jerseys, specifically the burgundy and the black jerseys, were more popular than the white ones. Still, most fans longed for something resembling the franchise's historic past. That's why the Super Bowl-era uniforms were introduced in 2025.\n\nThe longstanding rumor is that these uniforms will become permanent in 2026. The Commanders would also introduce a burgundy jersey resembling the ones they wore as the Redskins. That would explain why each of the jerseys introduced in 2022 is on clearance: they could be going away.\n\nSo, if you want to find a Jayden Daniels or Terry McLaurin jersey, now could be the time.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Clearance jerseys are good news for throwbacks",

He made a significant impact, scoring 24 points in a 112-104 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at the Intuit Center on Thursday night.\n\nLeonard came into Thursday's game averaging a career-high 28.9 points while playing in 30 of the Clippers' 43 games. He had scored a combined 68 points versus the Washington Wizards and Charlotte Hornets in the two games he played before sitting out with his injury. Leonard played 25 minutes, shooting 9-for-19 (and 3-of-7 on 3-pointers) from the floor.\n\nKawhi doing Kawhi things 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/WRH7eWx4JW\n\n— LA Clippers (@LAClippers) January 23, 2026\n\nThe Clippers held a 79-53 lead midway through the third quarter after an Ivica Zubac dunk. From there, however, the Lakers chipped away at that 26-point margin with a 19-7 run to end the frame. That became a 34-14 run that trimmed the Clippers' lead to 93-85 by the 7:40 mark of the fourth quarter.\n\nA Luka Dončić fadeaway 3-pointer with Kris Dunn guarding him moved the Lakers to within 93-91 with 5:56 remaining. But James Harden countered with a 3 of his own to finally stop the Lakers' momentum and steady the Clippers. John Collins followed with a layup and Zubac hit two free throws to restore the Clippers' lead back to 100-91 with under four minutes to play.\n\nLUKA DONCIC. \n\nOUT OF THIS WORLD. pic.twitter.com/mn8yi1zSqY\n\n— Italo Santana (@BulletClubIta) January 23, 2026\n\nClippers coach Ty Lue then won a big replay challenge, arguing that a foul on Jordan Miller should instead be ruled a loose ball foul on the Lakers' Marcus Smart. Lue won the challenge, which took two free throws away from Smart and awarded them to Miller because the Lakers were in the penalty. Miller made one of the two free throws, but that gave the Clippers a 10-point lead.\n\nYet the Lakers fought back again with LeBron James getting a fast-break dunk and Smart turning a Miller turnover into a jumper. Leonard committed another turnover, losing the ball out of bounds, and that led to a Jarred Vanderbilt dunk to cut the Clippers' lead to 103-99.\n\nFollowing two free throws by Zubac, James was fouled on a layup and made the subsequent free throw for a 3-point play to pull the Lakers to within 105-102. But Zubac followed with a reverse dunk and Collins hit a 3-pointer after Rui Hachimura missed a long-range shot of his own. That was the dagger, giving the Clippers a 110-102 lead with 43 seconds remaining.\n\nDoncic finished with a game-high 32 points, but shot 11-of-27 from the floor (including 3-of-13 on 3s). He added 11 rebounds and 8 assists. James scored 23 points after tallying only 9 at halftime. But he also shot 9-of-19 while grabbing 5 rebounds and dishing out 6 assists.\n\nThe Lakers' loss dropped them to 26-17 and the No. 6 spot in the Western Conference, behind the Houston Rockets and Phoenix Suns. Up next, they visit the Dallas Mavericks (19-26) for a nationally televised prime-time matchup Saturday on ABC. The Mavs have won four in a row and five of their past six games.\n\nFor the Clippers, Zubac scored 18 points with 19 rebounds while Harden also scored 18 and notched 10 assists. Altogether, seven Clippers reached double figures in scoring. The win was the Clippers' 14th in their past 17 games and improved their record to 20-24, good for 10th place in the West. They're off until Sunday, when they host the Brooklyn Nets (12-30).",

    "description": "Despite Draisaitl's return, the Oilers suffered a swift defeat, with McDavid admitting the team's puck play is \"real, real bad.\"",
    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Penguins struck first and struck quickly on Thursday night. If that wasn't bad enough, they did so two more times in 35 seconds to take a 3-0 lead in the first three minutes of a game that the Edmonton Oilers should have wanted to start well in, if for no other reason than their starting goaltender was playing his old team.\n\nAnthony Mantha scored both goals, and neither was Tristan Jarry's fault. Sidney Crosby scored seconds later with a beautiful tip from the slot, easily winning the head-to-head battle against Connor McDavid, who, by his own admission, wasn't very good.\n\nJarry was hung out to dry, and McDavid's offense wasn't there to save the day.\n\nInjury Update: Will Mattias Ekholm Make It to The Olympics After All?\n\nThe Oilers' Trade Deadline Dilemma: Maybe the Answer Is Already Here\n\nPodkolzin's Fight Shows What The Oilers Are Missing\n\nThree goals in four shots was not the way the Oilers wanted to start after two brutally flat periods the game before against the New Jersey Devils.\n\nThe disaster against the Penguins was another embarrassing start for the Oilers. They began to push back in the latter half of the period, eventually outshooting the Penguins 13-9, but they couldn't sustain things, and their puck management remained an issue.  It remained a problem all night, and the Oilers eventually lost 6-2.\n\nMcDavid said the game wasn't on Jarry. Too many Grade-A looks again, he noted. That included an easy tip-in and a breakaway. \"Obviously not ideal, not a great start. Playing catch-up is tough in this league, and you look pretty bad when you're doing it.\"\n\nWhen asked about when this Oilers team needs to flip the switch that everyone is waiting on them to flip: \"30 games left, we're coming down the home stretch here. There's no February this year. Our sense of urgency has got to go up in our group.\"\n\nMcDavid added, \"The playoff race is really tight. We've got to find a way to get points here, especially at home.\"\n\nAs mentioned earlier, McDavid was the first to admit he wasn't very good. In back-to-back games, he's not gotten a point. \"It starts with me; my last two were probably not my best. I can be better,\" he said. \"When I'm better, the whole group usually responds. So that starts there.\"\n\nThe problem is that the Oilers, as a group, are flat.\n\nIt's clear to everyone, including the Oilers' captain, that there's an issue. \"It can even start in practice, I thought our puck play has been real bad. Real, real bad,\" McDavid said. \"We're not really connecting on passes. When we do, it's kind of sloppy, bouncing, whatever it is. When we're playing that way, we look slow and clunky. I thought we've looked that way for the last two games.\"\n\n\"Yeah, he's absolutely right,\" Knoblauch said. \"Some nights you're not feeling it, but after a certain amount of time, a long stretch, then you have to change something.\" Knoblauch agreed, \"The last two games, the puck play has been horrendous. We've given up a lot of chances.\"\n\nAs for the urgency, that's one of two things, the coach said. First, the players find it within themselves to play harder and find a way, or second, \"the coach just chooses the guys who are playing with that urgency and can dictate ice time.\"\n\nWhen it came to the three goals in 37 seconds, \"Obviously, giving up three goals in the first three minutes is not good. We weren't ready.\"\n\nJarry didn't have his best game, but he certainly wasn't the problem. The parade of chances against meant this game could have been 8 or 9 goals against if not for some big saves.\n\nWhen it came to the Oilers letting Jarry down, \"Very disappointing, especially for Jarry,\" said Knoblauch. \"How many breakaways, two-on-ones, Grade-A scoring chances... You look at the shots against, and it looks bad, six goals on 21 shots, but the type of chances we gave up, it was not an easy night for our goaltender.\"\n\nJarry spoke after the game, too.\n\n\"It's tough, just managing the puck. It's key for any team. Our puck management tonight hurt us a little bit,\" said Jarry. He admitted he wanted to beat his old team, but three goals against in 37 seconds made that difficult.\n\n\"I think it's just being on the same page.

    "fullText": "United States forward Trinity Rodman has signed a new three-year deal with the National Women's Soccer League's Washington Spirit that will reportedly make her the world's highest-paid woman footballer.\n\nThe Spirit announced the signing in a statement on Thursday, calling it \"one of the most significant contracts in the NWSL and the women's game worldwide, reflecting both Rodman's elite status and the Spirit's role as a global standard-bearer in women's soccer.\"\n\nESPN and The Athletic reported the deal is worth more than $2 million annually, including bonuses.\n\nHer agent, Mike Senkowski of Upper 90 Sports Group, told both outlets it will make her the highest-paid female player in the world.\n\nRodman, daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, was drafted at the age of 18 in 2021 and earned Rookie of the Year honors as the Spirit won their first NWSL title.\n\nShe has won Olympic gold, and while the Spirit fell in the past two NWSL title matches, the club has made retaining her a priority.\n\n\"I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,\" Rodman said in a statement. \"I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed.\n\n\"We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.\"\n\nThe path to re-sign Rodman, whose previous contract expired on December 31, hasn't been smooth.\n\nA four-year deal that would have paid Rodman significantly \n\nThe NWSL Players Association responded by filing a grievance against the league on Rodman's behalf.\n\nIn December, the league's board of governors approved the creation of a new High Impact Player rule, allowing teams to spend up to $1 million beyond the salary cap on certain stars in a bid to keep them in the league.\n\nESPN had reported that Rodman had offers from overseas clubs, notably in England.\n\n\"Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly, she represents the future of this club and the future of women's soccer,\" Spirit owner Michele Kang said. \"This agreement reflects our belief that elite talent deserves elite commitment.\"",

    "description": "Pace and Pensacola Catholic girls soccer advanced to their respective district finals to lead Jan. 22's district soccer tournament action.",
    "fullText": "District soccer tournaments continued Thursday. Two area teams advanced to district finals, while at least one saw it's season come to an end in the district semifinals.\n\nBelow is a recap of tonight's action.\n\nNo. 1 Fort Walton Beach 5, No. 4 West Florida 0\n\nThe Vikings (11-4-3 overall) led 4-0 at halftime and will host No. 2 Wakulla in the District 1-4A championship on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m.\n\nWest Florida (5-11-2) is eliminated from the district tournament but has likely done enough to advance to the Region 1-4A tournament. The Jaguars entered the district tournament ranked No. 6 in Region 1-4A and the second to last team in the eight-team field.\n\nNo. 2 Pace 2, No. 3 Navarre 2 (Pace advances 4-2 on penalty kicks)\n\nPace senior goalie Zoey Mattes discussed the exact moment with her teammates on the bus ride to Ashton Brosnaham Park.\n\nIf the Patriots went to penalty kicks, she was taking one. Right before the shootout, she decided she would take the one that ended it.\n\nAfter watching her teammates convert three of Pace’s first four penalty kicks and Navarre put two of its four wide, her prediction came true. She sent the ball high and right and into the back of the net to send the Patriots to their second district championship game in the last three years.\n\nPace (11-4) will play No. 1 Niceville in the District 1-6A championship on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m. at Ashton Brosnaham Park. The winner will clinch an automatic berth in the Region 1-6A tournament, though both teams have done enough to clinch an at-large bid if they don’t win a district title.\n\nNavarre (10-8-2) is eliminated and will wait to see if it makes the regional tournament. The Raiders entered the district tournament ranked No. 8 in the region.\n\n“It’s nice that it was me finishing out the game,” Mattes said. “I didn’t rely on anyone else. Obviously my teammates made there’s before, but it was nice knowing that I had this place to stake that I’m here and I’m going to finish this out for my team.”\n\nMattes was experiencing much different emotions about 90 minutes earlier, when Pace went into the locker room at halftime trailing 2-0.\n\nRaiders sophomore Kylyn Shawaryn scored her teams first goal in the ninth minute, then senior Emma Barry doubled the lead four minutes later. Navarre outworked Pace in the first half, with Mattes imploring her teammates to play with more energy.\n\nMattes and junior Kylin Williamson worked to get the squad's energy back up, and the Patriots found a spark early in the second half. Katelyn Borchik put home a rebound off a corner kick in the 48th minute to cut the lead in half.\n\n10 minutes later, Williamson’s free kick bounced off the crossbar and inside the goal line to tie the game. Pace forced overtime despite being without their top goalscorer, senior forward Sydney Crow, who is competing this weekend with the US Youth Soccer Olympic Development Program South Region Team at the Interregional Games in Orlando.\n\n“They believed that we could win and they kept fighting,” Pace head coach Nick Williamson said. “We got some great leaders on this team and they stepped up for each other, but also our bench was deep and they absolutely supported each other. It was a good team win for us and couldn’t be more proud.”\n\nMattes did her best to keep Navarre off the board from there, including a wild sequence late in the second half where she made a diving save on a free kick, then stopped a follow up shot while still on the ground.\n\nSkill that comes from training she does with Coastal Rush outside of Pace soccer practice. During Patriots practices, she’s a field player, which gives Nick Williamson reason to trust her no matter what she does.\n\nThis game, that meant taking the final penalty kick to send Pace to a district final for the second time in three years and likely ensure a Region 1-6A quarterfinal home game.\n\n“I got 100 percent faith in that kid,” Nick Williamson said. “I don’t care where she plays. Goal or forward, it doesn’t matter.”\n\nNo. 1 Niceville 6, No. 5 Tate 0\n\nAs Aggies assistant coach Kendall Blackmon saw it, the Eagles did exactly what they needed to do to advance to Tuesday’s District 1-6A final. But not for a lack of trying on Tate’s end.\n\nNiceville led 2-0 before scoring four more goals in the second half. The Eagles (14-1-1) will play No. 2 Pace in the District 1-6A final on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m. at Ashton Brosnaham Park.\n\nTate (13-5-2) is eliminated and its season is over. The Aggies needed to win the district tournament to advance to the Region 1-6A tournament.\n\n“Once you’re down it’s kind of hard to stay (up),” Blackmon said. “But the girls fought the entire game. That’s all I ask for them. I don’t care if we lose as long as they give 110 percent everything.”\n\nNiceville’s Riley Mcinnis put home a rebound off a corner kick for the Eagles first goal in the 15th minute, then Molly Johnson doubled the lead 11 minutes later. Abbey Kuritz, Payten Hart, Michelle Melancon and Jezlyn Nelson all scored goals in the second half.\n\nTate finishes this year with its most wins in a season since 2016. The Aggies didn’t make history like they did last year with their first regional appearance since 2007, but the five graduating seniors were a part of that group that raised expectations for the program.\n\nExpectations that next year’s group could reach again. Tate projects to return 78 percent of its goals scored by this year’s team.\n\n“They definitely have had an impact and we’re going to miss them,” Blackmon said. “We’re also a young team. We have a lot of new people and at the end of the day we’re rebuilding. Compared to whenever I played here, it’s night and day.”\n\nNo. 2 Pensacola Catholic 6, No. 3 Freeport 0\n\nThe Crusaders scored five goals in the first half and rolled to their fifth straight district finals appearance.\n\nPensacola Catholic (11-2-3) will play at No. 1 South Walton in the District 1-3A championship on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m.\n\nThe Crusaders beat the Seahawks 2-0 in South Walton on Nov. 5. They'll hit the road again for the district final as the Seahawks are ranked higher in the FHSAA power rankings.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pensacola News Journal: Pace and Pensacola Catholic girls soccer advance to district finals",

    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Kawhi Leonard scored 24 points — his career-high 23rd consecutive game with at least 20 — and the Los Angeles Clippers survived a tight fourth quarter to beat Luka Doncic and the Los Angeles Lakers 112-104 on Thursday night.\n\nThe Clippers have won seven of eight and 14 of 17 as they continue their upward climb from the depths of the Western Conference. Leonard, who missed a stretch when his team had nearly bottomed out in the standings, has a left knee contusion but he didn't sit for long in the fourth.\n\nLeBron James scored 4 points and Doncic hit a 3-pointer to cap a 19-7 run that closed the Lakers within two.\n\nJames Harden answered Doncic's 3 with one of his own as the Clippers ran off 10 in a row to stay in front, 103-91.\n\nBut the Lakers weren't done yet. James hit a jumper and completed a three-point play in an 11-2 run that drew them within three.\n\nIvica Zubac's reverse dunk and John Collins' 3-pointer extended the Clippers' lead to eight points and they closed it out on Harden's pair of free throws.\n\nLuka Doncic had 32 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and James added 23 points. The Lakers fell to 5-6 in their last 11.\n\nHarden had 18 points and 10 assists and Zubac added 18 points and 19 rebounds for the Clippers, who had seven players in double figures.\n\nLeonard, Harden and Zubac combined to score the Clippers' first 15 points of the third, extending their lead to 26 points — largest of the game.\n\nFrom there, the Lakers outscored them 19-7 to go into the fourth trailing 86-72. James opened the spurt with a 3-pointer and ended it with a huge dunk off Harden's turnover after Doncic chipped in 9 points in the quarter.\n\nThe Clippers dominated the first half, outscoring the Lakers 17-7 — including nine in a row — over the final minutes to go into halftime leading 64-47.\n\nDoncic scored just three of his 17 first-half points in the second quarter when Leonard led the bench against Doncic and James. The Clippers shot 59% from the floor while limiting the Lakers to 42%.\n\nThe Lakers were still without Austin Reaves (calf strain), although coach JJ Redick expects him back soon.\n\nLakers: Visit the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday to open a six-game trip against Doncic's old team.\n\nClippers: Host the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "Swedes and Finns aren’t known to get along, but tonight was different.\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes suffered a hard-fought defeat to the Chicago Blackhawks as they fell in the shootout. It wasn’t for a lack of effort, nor a lack of puck luck, but rather substantial struggles on their power play, which has been red hot as of late. The first goal of the game was shorthanded for the Blackhawks, and despite having four other chances on the man-advantage, Carolina was unable to produce.\n\nWith every goal the Blackhawks put on the board, the Hurricanes answered in kind, as Chicago could not hold the lead for more than 4:40 before the game would be tied again. The first goal came from the stick of Swedish rookie defenseman Joel Nystrom, as the lone apple came from Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi.\n\nNystrom laughed in the locker room at the irony of it, but expressed his gratitude for finally notching his first career NHL goal after dishing 41 shots at goaltenders since he arrived in Raleigh.\n\n“I’m happy to get my first goal, I’ve been waiting for it, it was good,” he said after the game. “Great pass from ‘KK’, and I had a lot of space there, so I just tried to shoot it – and happy to see it went in.”\n\nThe other two goals on Carolina came from Jordan Staal and Jackson Blake, while the Hurricanes played a very physical game. They landed 29 hits, and notably got under the skin of Oliver Moore after his teammate Nick Lardis took a blow from Alexander Nikishin. Moore and Nikishin dropped the gloves as they both engaged in the first fight of their NHL careers. Both were given a five-minute fighting major, though Moore also assessed a minor for roughing.\n\nAlexander Nikishin VS Oliver Moore 🔔🥊\nAfter Alexander Nikishin landed a clean but heavy hit on Nick Lardis, Oliver Moore started swiping and Nikishin and the two dropped the gloves for a quick dust-up\nMoore, who turned 21 today, left the ice for repair#CarolinaCulture… pic.twitter.com/y8OnLnChmk\n\n— Queen of the Puck (@rbarkleyhockey) January 23, 2026\n\nAs the game dragged into overtime, the Hurricanes noticeably struggled to gain puck possession from the hungry Blackhawks, who refused to take their foot off the gas.\n\nThe shootout ran unusually long, as it extended to six rounds through matching goals and failures. However, the final horn of the game sounded in favor of the Blackhawks, as the bruised and battered Moore lit the lamp rather than merely candles on his birthday.\n\nShayne Gostisbehere and Eric Robinson remained out due to injuries.\n\nSean Walker led the team in hits with six, which matched his season high recorded on December 19th and January 16th, both against the Florida Panthers.\n\nFrederik Andersen has played significantly better in his latest stretch of games, which continued tonight. He made 19 saves on 22 shots against and stopped four of six shots faced in the shootout.\n\nK’Andre Miller participated as the fourth of the Hurricanes’ picks for the shootout and came before even Logan Stankoven. It is always odd to see a defenseman go for the extra event, but especially so for one who has only scored four goals on the season. That one was a bit of a head scratcher.\n\nCarolina Hurricanes Game 51: Lines, Notes, and How to Watch vs. Blackhawks\n\nHurricanes Injury Report: Eric Robinson Expected to Miss Time\n\nLet’s Get Physical!

The Hornets would creep in on the Riverhawks’ lead, and with less than 8:30 to go in the game, Emporia State would regain the lead and start to separate itself.\n\n“I thought we played really well,” ESU head coach Tom Billeter said. “Even when we lost the lead, I thought we were getting good looks and good shots.”\n\nThe Hornets shot 49.2% from the floor, highlighted by three guys in double figures, including Treyvon Taylor with 21 points and Chris Harris adding 18. Trey Redd had 17 points and 10 assists for a double-double.\n\nThis is the Hornets’ first true road win of the season.\n\nNext up, Emporia State takes on Arkansas-Fort Smith on Jan. 23 at 5:30 p.m.\n\nFor more sports news, click here.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers football coach Curt Cignetti never stays away from practically any topic, especially when it has to do with the success of his football team.\n\nIt was no different after the Hoosiers beat the Miami Hurricanes in the national title game Monday, as they clinched a 16-0 season with a 27-21 triumph. Amid much scrutiny over Cignetti's future in Indiana, he clarified that he will be in Bloomington for the long haul.\n\n“Good question,” Cignetti told reporters, “Because I’ll be dealing with underclassmen going to the NFL tomorrow and who knows what else. And if I was smart, I’d probably retire. Then, I’d really be a story. But we need the money. What would I do? What would I do?\"\n\nWhat Cignetti will continue to do is coach, which he said he genuinely enjoys.\n\nMORE: College football pundit shares shocking Ohio State football ranking amid 2026 off-season\n\n“I’m a film junkie, and I like putting a team together, and we’re going to have a lot of challenges next season,\" Cignetti said. \"But I will have a chance to look back at what we got done. These guys made it happen. Let me tell you, we had some good senior leadership on this team.\"\n\nThat leadership, of course, was led by quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who has become a fan favorite almost overnight, before his fame ultimately skyrocketed after winning the Heisman Trophy.\n\n“But this team was exceptionally close. And I think Fernando had a big part of that, and I think [Pat] Coogan and [Aiden] Fisher and going on the road with some of those guys — the Penn State game, what that did for this team, I can’t measure, when we were down and out and all the odds were against us, Second-and-17, running clock, one minute and 30 [seconds], and all of a sudden we recomposed and found a way to get that done. That was incredible.”\n\nMORE: Joel Klatt opens up about why Indiana football's national title win is 'exceedingly rare'\n\nThere will be a lot of memories to look back on as the years go by.

    "title": "On This Day (23 January 1954) Purdon Makes A Big Impact As Sunderland Trounce Arsenal!",
    "description": "The new signing was making a big impact!",
    "fullText": "In January 1954 Sunderland were struggling towards the lower reaches of the first division table and – as was the perennial solution to any problem at the time – the board splashed the cash to try to resolve it.\n\nThis time, it was Birmingham’s South African born striker Ted Purdon who arrived at Roker – the 23 year old having scored 27 in 64 games since arriving in England four years earlier.\n\nTwo goals in a 5-0 win on his debut against Cardiff City at Roker Park announced his arrival in style; a much needed boost after just two wins in the previous ten games, but next up was a trip to Highbury to face reigning champions Arsenal.\n\nIt would be a tough test, no doubt, but this inconsistent Sunderland team had already beaten the Gunners earlier in the season – a remarkable 7-1 score line giving Bill Murray’s team the two points – and with new signing Purdon in the ranks, and coming off the back of a convincing win over the Bluebirds, confidence was no doubt high.\n\nAnd that confidence was not misplaced, as Sunderland took the lead in what is thought to be the club’s fastest ever goal – Purdon netting after just 10 seconds, with Arsenal not even touching the ball!\n\nIn front of a packed Highbury crowd of more than 60,000 (according to press reports, ‘the Wearsiders are always a big attraction in the capital’), Sunderland kicked off and were in front immediately; Chisholm slipping the ball through to Purdon, who calmly controlled it and slipped the ball past Gunners keeper Kelsey.\n\nThe lads almost made it two moments after, with Chisholm’s shot deflected for a corner, but within six minutes Arsenal were level; Holton scoring from the edge of the box, beating Cowan just under the bar.\n\nBoth sides had opportunities to get into the lead; Lishman missing a good chance for Arsenal, and Shackleton shooting straight at Kelsey. Shack’s chance came from a Purdon knock down, and the recent signing was showing up incredibly well, turning in a lively display and causing the Arsenal defence all manner of problems.\n\nSunderland dictated much of a fast-paced first half, and should have had a penalty when Shackleton was brought down, but while as shaky as Arsenal were at the back, they were dangerous up front, with Lishman causing all manner of problems. Cowan in the Sunderland goal pulled off a couple of big saves to keep the score level, and the teams went in at half time with the score 1-1.\n\nLate in the first half, Tommy Wright had injured himself in a tackle, and with no subs available he went to centre forward, with Shackleton moving to the right wing and Purdon playing inside forward.\n\nArsenal had a couple of dangerous moves, but Sunderland quickly exerted their strength, creating ‘several brilliant attacks’, and ‘quick, first-time passes had the Arsenal defence rocking’.\n\nA richly deserved second goal for the lads arrived just after the hour, and it was Purdon again on the scoresheet. Billy Elliott got the ball into the box after his own surging run had been stopped, and Purdon slid in to just get there ahead of Kelsey and put the ball into the net.\n\nArsenal came back strongly – a terrific goalmouth scramble saw Sunderland just keep the ball out – and moments later it was 3-1; the injured Wright finding himself with only Kelsey to beat, after Purdon had gone past two men with a great run.\n\nA lack of response to the third goal saw the Arsenal crowd of over 60,000 leave in their thousands, and there weren’t too many of them left to see Purdon complete his hat trick to make it 4-1 just before the end, the new signing slotting home after Shackleton’s brilliant cross.\n\nTwo wins and five goals in your first two games. Not a bad way for a new striker to introduce himself!",

    "description": "From Rooney's Plymouth to Xhaka's European push - how far have we come in 12 months?",
    "fullText": "Ahead of Saturday and our return fixture against West Ham, I can’t help but cast my mind back to August 16th 2025. The Stadium of Light was absolutely pulsating and West Ham were the unfortunate souls tasked with welcoming us back to the Premier League. That 3-0 demolition job, with Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor writing their names into the season’s opening chapter, felt like somewhat of a fever dream.\n\nWith the power of retrospect, that win was not simply just the result of adrenaline but was, instead, a statement. It told other teams in this league that we’re not here to make up the numbers.\n\nAs we near the end of January, we’re right in the mix for the European places, sitting comfortably on 33 points.\n\nTwelve months ago, we were in the mire of the Championship, giving tactical mastermind Wayne Rooney and his soon-to-be-doomed Plymouth squad a generous point at our home ground.\n\nFast forward to today, and as we prepare for the return fixture at the Taxpayers’ Stadium on Saturday, the landscape has changed entirely. Had someone told me in that Plymouth game that we would not only be promoted but would then remain unbeaten at home during the first half of a Premier League season, I’d have called for a straitjacket.\n\nWhat Régis Le Bris, along with Kristian Speakman, our recruitment team and the players themselves, have done in half a season is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nFrom the home fixture against West Ham, I feel like we’re in an even stronger position as a team. Gone are the days of the slightly chaotic Championship side. Instead, in its place, is a disciplined, suffocating Premier League unit. Not only that, but the synergy between the players and fans is clear to see.\n\nWhen we fell behind against Crystal Palace, there was no sense of panic or dread. We knew that chances would come.\n\nHitting 33 points before February is truly incredible. It represents a springboard and reflects one of the most exciting periods to be supporting Sunderland AFC. For me, any fear of relegation has been replaced by the genuine, albeit mildly terrifying, prospect of a European tour. Twelve months ago, we were sweating over Championship play-off permutations…\n\nWe head into this weekend sitting in 9th place and only 3 points away from 4th. Saturday isn’t just about three points, though. It’s about doing the double over a struggling West Ham side and providing a clear sign of how far the pendulum has swung. With solid recruitment and relentlessly high expectations driven from Granit Xhaka, we’re demonstrating that we are not just a “plucky” promoted side. Under Régis Le Bris, we’ve found a level of tactical maturity that, frankly, should have taken years to cultivate. This isn’t the same Sunderland of the late 2010s, where we relied upon miracles and had to endure weekly rallying cries. Instead, it’s a tactically astute outfit that has spent the last five months proving every pundit wrong.\n\nThe journey from August 16th to where we are today is remarkable. If the opening day win was a statement, then the last five months have been the proof. I, for one, can’t wait to see where we end up in 12 months.",

    "fullText": "I just caught myself checking this weekend’s Liverpool and Manchester United fixtures to see if we’ll overtake them with a win at West Ham.\n\nI’ve supported Sunderland for over five decades and this season is just crackers in the way it just keeps surprising me.\n\nI survived a massive stroke the day we won the playoff final and am starting to wonder if I actually died and went to heaven.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Alan. Thank you for your letter — and I hope you’re well on the way to a full recovery after your stroke.\n\nIt’s certainly been quite the season for Sunderland so far, and with two positive results in our next two games, we’ll be ideally placed to mount a strong challenge towards the end of the campaign and to finish as highly as we possibly can.\n\nInteresting times to come, for sure!\n\nI just want to draw your attention to a few flaws in the “ticket resale” option, as the Sunderland website stated that gift vouchers could be used on any credit that is in your ticket resale account.\n\nI’ve since been made aware that the gift vouchers aren’t available to be used in the club shop and can only be used on premium gift vouchers or a stadium tour gift voucher — neither of which I intend to use, and I now have credit on my balance which I have no way of using.\n\nHad I known this was the case, I wouldn’t have put my ticket on resale and I doubt I’ll be doing it in the future if this is the case. I found this very misleading, as nowhere on the website does it state that the gift vouchers can only be used on the above items.\n\nIt clearly states “Gift voucher” on the “What can I buy with my credit?” page. The credit can’t be used against season tickets either, if paid via direct debit. What started out as a decent option for supporters now looks to be pointless to the majority of those who use it!\n\nThis has now been changed on the website, with the club basically admitting their mistake of misleading supporters.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Matthew. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nIt seems that there’s clearly been some form of miscommunication on behalf of the club which has led to confusion on this issue, but nowadays, we receive far fewer letters at Roker Report expressing dissatisfaction at customer service standards and the like.\n\nIt does seem to have improved a great deal but this has obviously been an unfortunate one — and hopefully it won’t be repeated.\n\nI’m a New York City guy and I started watching the documentary during Covid.\n\nI fell in love with this team and players like Luke O’Nien, Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson. This was the greatest underdog story and seeing the revival of this team was made so much sweeter because of me first watching that documentary.\n\nI’ve been following the team since then — much to the dismay of my friends that include Arsenal, Spurs and Leeds fans.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, CJ. Thank you for your letter.\n\nIt’s great to hear that you’ve been following Sunderland’s progress and elevation back to the Premier League — and hopefully the Lads can make even more unforgettable memories during the seasons to come!",

    "description": "There are claims from some people that the Premier League is dull this year, but the 0-0 draw can be a fascinating beast",
    "fullText": "The 0-0 draw between Wolves and Newcastle was the second goalless game of the weekend, and the 17th of the season. This is already more than last season, and six more than in the whole of the 2023-24 season.\n\nStalemates are often dull and are usually examples of strikers having off days or goalkeepers having a blinder. This is true for most of them, but the context of these games is so important. \n\nSunderland have been involved in three 0-0 draws so far this season, away at Crystal Palace and Brighton, and then at home to Man City. From our perspective, all three have been rewarding and were achieved thanks to back-to-the-wall defending and plenty of grit.\n\nThe Palace game was only the fourth game of the season, but looking back, it was the first that showed how solid we wanted to be. The FA Cup holders hammered Villa 3-0 in the previous game, but we were fantastic at the back to pick up a brilliant point on the road. \n\nDogged defending is a thing of beauty, and one that is overlooked far too often. There is an art in defending, and this season, having conceded 23 in 22 games, we’ve shown ourselves to be masters of this particular art. \n\nEvery point in the Premier League should be celebrated, and maybe that’s why a battling 0-0 draw feels so good. The Man City game was a perfect example of good old fashioned, honest, gutsy defending with players celebrating blocks and tackles.\n\nThis tough attitude should be commended, and there’s nothing wrong with grinding out results here and there. Promoted teams need to come up and be hard to beat, and five losses in 22 games prove we’ve done just that. \n\nThere may have been some boring 0-0 draws in the Premier League this season, but I wouldn’t class ours in any of these. Maybe that’s a Sunderland bias shining through, but at full-time against Man City, I felt as though I’d watched a proper game of football where both sides had chances, but both defences prevailed over the forwards, and it was a back-and-forth kind of game in this sense. \n\nThere has been talk that the Premier League this season is weaker and more boring than in recent years, which seems odd considering that, for the first time in a long time, more than one promoted team has come up and competed. Last season saw three crap teams get promoted and go straight back down with not much of a whimper. It’s almost as if the established sides don’t like it when promoted teams show some fight, which is what we and Leeds are doing in spadefuls. \n\nWe’ll probably have at least one more 0-0 draw this season, and when that comes, it will likely be just as gutsy and fulfilling as the three we have in the bag. I’m still full of pride for Sunderland thriving back in the Premier League and each block, tackle, and header is a step closer towards sealing our status in the top flight next season.",

    "fullText": "During the build up to our home game against Arsenal, I was browsing various forums and came across an article on an Arsenal fan website which assessed the quality of their next opponents.\n\nIt used the (now familiar to us, whether we like it or not) variable of “xG difference” — something we’re reminded of every week on Sky Sports and Match of the Day. For those who don’t know or don’t care, here’s a brief explanation so that you can at least understand for the sake of the article.\n\nXG is basically is the “expected goals” that a side is likely to score in a game, whereas “XG difference” is the expected difference between expected goals scored and expected goals conceded.\n\nIndeed, during a season, there are tables out there showing which teams have the best and worst XG difference throughout the whole campaign so far — which we’ll come onto — but back to the the Arsenal forum’s assessment ahead of our home game on 8 November.\n\nThe “xG difference table” at that point in the season apparently had us ranked “slightly better than Burnley” — who were the bottom of the “XG league”. So looking forward to the game, Gunners’ fans basically had us down as a real poor side and that the game at the Stadium of Light should’ve been one of the easier three points they would get this season.\n\nAs we all know, Sunderland gave Arsenal one of their hardest games of the season to date in a 2-2 draw.\n\nFurthermore, during the twelve games since then, and in what was acknowledged to be the most difficult period of our season in terms of fixtures and losing more players to the AFCON than anyone else, we produced three wins, three defeats and six draws (one of which was a cup win on penalties at Everton ) — hardly the form of a team the data lovers predict should be getting battered every week.\n\nI’m bringing this up now because ahead of Saturday’s game against Crystal Palace, the “XG difference” stats were being produced again, this time in a lengthy article on the BBC’s own website — which you can read here.\n\nAgain the “XG difference” ranks Burnley as by far the worst team in the Premier League, with ourselves as second worst…behind Wolves.\n\nYes, Wolves are better than us, according to the XG purists.\n\nThe article goes on to predict that like a chain from the seabed to a ship trying to pull away, “XG difference” will win through in the end and ourselves and Aston Villa — another club not performing according to the rule book — will get dragged down the league table at some point to where “we should really be”, and if not this season, next season, when we’ll surely suffer from “second season syndrome” like so many promoted clubs before us.\n\nMaybe as Sunderland fans we’re biased and just don’t want to believe it, but I’d say the argument that as a promoted club, we’re destined to face “second season syndrome”, which happened to the likes of Sheffield United, Huddersfield and Ipswich is — and I’m not the first to say — lazy journalism, as they’ve never looked further than the club name and where they came from (the Championship).\n\nIt ignores the fact that apart from a couple of regulars each week, this is a different Sunderland team to the one that won the Championship playoff final back in May — and that there have been way more than one or two quality recruits added to the ranks.\n\nAccording to the stats, one of them (Robin Roefs) is the best-performing shot stopper in the league.\n\nIf there’s a stat that says he is, who’s to argue with it? But when watching him week in and week out, we’re not seeing somebody who’s being peppered with shots like the top prize on the shelf in a coconut shy — so what factors have been taken into account?\n\nWhat’s also largely been ignored is that with the third-best defensive record in the Premier League, Sunderland have largely been set up to defend deeply and to not look to dominate possession.\n\nFor any XG proponent who thinks this is because we’re struggling to do otherwise in the Premier League, it’s worth pointing out that this is what we often did in the Championship under Régis Le Bris.\n\nThe exponents of XG will argue that in increasingly data-driven world of coaching, it’s a stat that the coaches sit up and take notice of, and that they strive to produce teams that have the best stats prior to kick off.\n\nMaybe that’s true, but it’s not the be-all and end-all.\n\nFor one thing, if Sunderland’s XG difference is so bad, why didn’t Le Bris and his staff resign months ago?\n\n“We’ve done all we can but the situation is hopeless. I know we’re currently ninth in the Premier League but the XG difference doesn’t lie. It predicts we’re buggered, so myself and the coaching staff have decided to step aside so that somebody else can turn the XG situation around”.\n\nMaybe I’ve missed it but you rarely hear of managers or head coaches of any team talking of XG in their post-match interviews — except maybe when they’ve been beaten — and some of the comments on the BBC article are worth a look in order to see what the fans of all clubs make of it all.\n\nA couple that caught my eye were along the lines of “You never hear a fan coming away from a match saying that we got beat but we won on XG” or “Manchester City had an XG of two before their cup tie against Exeter, but scored ten. How is this even possible?”\n\nHow about proposing a different set of metrics to measure how a team is doing? In it, the team that sticks the ball in the back of the net most often wins the match.\n\nXG is a metric that myself and I suspect an awful lot of other fans hadn’t heard of ten years ago.\n\nI have no doubt that it’s probably been used by the coaching staff of clubs up and down the country for a bit longer, but such increasing awareness of it in media analysis is fairly new.  As such, is it guaranteed to be 100% accurate? Clearly the XG proponents see Sunderland, Villa and an apparently underperforming Wolves as being anomalies that’ll inevitably fall into line in order to make their data justifiable.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that in Villa’s case, they have someone who’s recognised as one of the best coaches in world football? In our case, we know we have one of the most tactically astute coaches in English football with a bunch of quality recruits, and in Wolves’ case — despite playing well enough — they just can’t defend?\n\nDoes “XG difference” take into account any of these factors?",

    "title": "The Wilson Isidor Dilemma",
    "description": "“For now, it’s a waiting game — and this is the new reality at Sunderland”, writes Phil West of Isidor’s future",
    "fullText": "A short, sharp precursor to a January exit? Something and nothing — or the beginnings of a transfer saga that could cast a wholly unwelcome shadow over the remainder of Sunderland’s season before a summer move is eventually ratified and rubber-stamped?\n\nHowever you view it and regardless of which side of the “sell or keep” argument you sit, the recent rumours concerning Wilson Isidor’s future aren’t exactly unexpected, given his undeniable talent and the situation in which he currently finds himself at Sunderland, but they are highlighting the stark balance we have to strike — that of on-field progress, ambition and squad strength, and balanced books and final stability.\n\nInterest has supposedly arisen both at home and abroad, with fellow Premier League sides Nottingham Forest and Everton credited with an interest and French upstarts Paris FC — seemingly the new “noisy neighbours” in the French capital — apparently ready and willing to throw a comparatively enormous sum of money in our direction in order to lure Isidor across the channel.\n\n“We love you, Wilson…until £20-plus million is dangled in front of us, in which case we’d be happy to bid you farewell.”\n\nIf the mercurial striker does leave for pastures new, I can also see various coping mechanisms kicking in among pockets of the fanbase.\n\nIn some quarters, his ability, work rate and impact will be questioned, and his body language analysed for any signs of a poor attitude or a negative demeanour. This isn’t new; after all, if we convince ourselves that he’s already “checked out”, it would make it easier to deal with because deep down, we all know how talented a footballer he is and that he could be an asset to any team.\n\nI won’t lie: despite the numbers being bandied around, the thought of Sunderland selling Isidor to a Premier League rival — particularly without a very high-quality replacement arriving in his stead — gives me a burning feeling in the pit of my stomach, the kind I felt in the wake of Darren Bent’s messy Wearside exit in 2011.\n\nWere he to leave for France and a new league, fair enough, but potentially strengthening a rival whilst possibly weakening Régis Le Bris’ squad in the process? Not for me. I really do rate Isidor that highly and that’s how strongly I feel about it.\n\nI love his talent, his penchant for a spectacular goal, his seemingly endless supply of optimism and childlike joy at playing football for a living — as well as his potential at the top level, which at the time of writing remains tantalisingly untapped.\n\nFour Premier League goals may be something of a modest return but Isidor — a confidence player and someone for whom hot and cold streaks are simply part of the deal — is by no means a “Flash Harry” and we mustn’t forget that he played a key role during the successful 2024/2025 playoff campaign, getting the ball rolling with a superbly-taken goal against Coventry City — one of many ridiculous strikes he clocked up that season.\n\nThere’s another point here — one that needs to be reiterated in the strongest possible terms.\n\nAs Sunderland supporters, we should be willing to place trust in the club hierarchy when it comes to decisions like this, but I also believe that if we do have doubts or concerns about the potential impact of such a transfer, we should reserve the right to question such calls if and when they’re made.\n\nThis should be accepted without question and despite the exceptional work completed by Florent Ghisolfi and Kristjaan Speakman, allowing such a popular and talented player to leave — regardless of how widely and regularly the “We’ll easily be able find a replacement ” narrative is hawked around — wouldn’t be greeted entirely warmly.\n\nShould Isidor leave before the deadline, is it unreasonable to claim that with only Eliezer Mayenda and Brian Brobbey as our striking options, we would look somewhat short up top and that there would be far greater and possibly unnecessary pressure on Mayenda to begin to develop at an even quicker rate? I don’t think so, and I say that as someone who loves Mayenda as a player and has also been hugely impressed with the impact made by Brobbey.\n\nDepth at this level is key and no matter what the naysayers may claim, I firmly believe that Isidor does have the potential to establish himself as a genuine top flight-quality striker.\n\nThe arguments about his style not complimenting the team’s as a whole may not be totally without merit, but I also believe that players with unique attributes should be given chances to impress, and were we to develop the capacity to occasionally adjust our style of play and place more emphasis on finesse rather than force, that’s where he could thrive.\n\nFor now, it’s a waiting game — and this is the new reality at Sunderland.\n\nWith coveted players on the books comes the risk of interest from elsewhere, and it’s something that we may have to brace ourselves for more often if this season of huge promise continues in a similar vein.",

We were waiting and waiting for that to happen.”\n\n“We’re losing the ability for agents to conduct their work without fear or favor because the F.B.I. won’t protect you.”\n\nForty-five current and former employees on the changes they say are undermining the agency and making America less safe.\n\nWhen he returned to office last year, President Trump called the F.B.I. a “corrupt” agency in need of overhaul. He had by then been the subject of three F.B.I. investigations: Agents examined his 2016 campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, his retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Though all three inquiries took place in part or entirely under Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director Trump appointed, he repeatedly accused the bureau of mounting a partisan attack against him.\n\nTo replace Wray, Trump chose Kash Patel, a former public defender and intelligence official who had never worked for the F.B.I. and had spun conspiracy theories about the bureau. Since Patel’s confirmation last February, the F.B.I. has undergone a transformation that has upended its nonpartisan rules and norms, deeply rattling many of its 38,000 employees.\n\nPatel has fired agents who worked on the Trump investigations and radically changed the bureau’s mission. More than 20 percent of the F.B.I.’s work force has been assigned to immigration enforcement, pulling agents and analysts away from investigating public corruption, cybercrime, white-collar crime, drug trafficking and terrorism. Patel has also been embroiled in controversies over his use of government resources, his temperament and missteps in high-profile investigations.\n\nWe interviewed 45 employees who work at the F.B.I. or who left during Trump’s second term, as well as many other current and former government officials. Beginning with Trump’s selection of Patel, our sources narrated the events that most troubled them over the last year. Many details of what we learned are reported here for the first time.\n\nThe F.B.I. is a rule-bound and tight-lipped institution. Bureau policies prohibit active employees from speaking to the news media without authorization. Even for former employees, speaking out is a sign of serious alarm. Some of our sources shared their stories anonymously because they feared retribution from the administration. (To protect their identities, we are not indicating whether the people we quote anonymously are still employed by the F.B.I.) We corroborated their descriptions of specific events and conversations with colleagues, contemporaneous notes and internal records.\n\nPatel and other F.B.I. leaders named in this article declined our requests for interviews, and we followed up with a detailed list of questions. In response to a request for comment, Ben Williamson, an F.B.I. spokesman, wrote: “This story is a regurgitation of fake narratives, conjecture and speculation from anonymous sources who are disconnected from reality. They can whine and peddle falsehoods all they want — but it won’t change the facts that the F.B.I. under this administration worked with partners at every level and delivered a historic 2025.”\n\nWe also asked the White House for comment. “President Trump and F.B.I. Director Kash Patel are restoring integrity to the F.B.I. by returning its focus to fighting crime and letting good cops be cops,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement.\n\nMany current and former employees fear, however, that the F.B.I. has become a weapon of the White House, and that the firings and the diversion of resources to immigration enforcement have left the country vulnerable to attack.\n\nThree weeks after winning re-election, Trump named Patel as his nominee for F.B.I. director. On a podcast, Patel had promised to shut down bureau headquarters on his first day in the post and reopen it “as a museum of the deep state.”\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: I assumed Congress would see how uniquely unqualified Kash Patel was for the job. I assumed the Senate would do its due diligence and decide not to confirm him.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: When Kash Patel was nominated, we all knew in our bones that the bureau was going to be a very different environment than any of us had experienced before. He regularly referred to us as government gangsters. He was also the author of three children’s books in which he’s a self-styled wizard who saves King Donald Trump from the evil forces of the Justice Department.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: A lot of people in the F.B.I. have faith in the country and in the job. They may come from police or military families. They think they’re doing the right thing and it will all work out. And you know, there was a kernel of truth in what Patel was saying: There are too many people in headquarters. Let’s get more people back into the field.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: I wanted the White House to succeed. For 20 years, I collected information for the president’s daily briefing. I listened to Kash Patel on a podcast, and the way he viewed Jan. 6 aligned with the F.B.I. rank and file. Agents always thought if you assaulted officers on that day, yes, absolutely, we should investigate and prosecute you. For the rest of them, it was a massive misuse of resources.\n\nBut then I heard Patel was thinking of a mass purge of the leadership and dismissing agents wholesale.\n\nThe Trump administration decided that until Patel was confirmed, the F.B.I.’s acting director would be Rob Kissane, a veteran counterterrorism agent. The acting deputy director would be Brian Driscoll, the special agent in charge of the Newark field office. But in its announcement, the White House accidentally named Driscoll to the top position. Though it was an error, Driscoll became the acting No. 1 and Kissane became the No. 2.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: The White House reversing the announcement added to this uncertain, uncomfortable feeling — it doesn’t bode well if they didn’t get that right. But I’ve known Brian and Rob a long time, and some of the other executive assistant directors did as well. We’d all grown up in the bureau, and we wanted to work together.\n\n“They said we were being fired because we could not be trusted to carry out the president’s agenda.”\n\nAt his Senate confirmation hearing, Patel was asked whether he would fire the F.B.I. agents who worked on the investigations that led to the special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump. Patel responded that “no one will be terminated for case assignments.” Later in the hearing, he also promised there would be “no retributive actions” against employees.\n\nThe next day, Trump administration officials, including Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general and Trump’s former defense attorney, forced out the bureau’s top six executives, along with the heads of the F.B.I. field offices in Washington, D.C., and Miami.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: Those firings sent shock waves.\n\nSenior executive 1: It was hundreds of years of experience in one brutal swoop. It made it easier to bring their people in, yes, but there are no people to bring in with that level of experience, because it’s so specialized. You have to cut your teeth. It’s just like the military. To lead, you have to understand headquarters and the field.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: I came back to D.C. to run the office at the end of 2022 when two special counsels, Rob Hur and Jack Smith, were appointed to investigate Biden and Trump. I did not direct those cases, but it was my job to manage the agent and analyst resources for them.\n\nWe conducted factual and effective investigations into two presidents from two political parties at the same time. To do that, you need leadership that believes in the nonpartisan independence of the agency. When I was told to retire or be fired, I was frustrated that I couldn’t protect my analysts and agents from partisan interference. I wanted to be their shield.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: At the hearing, Patel made it sound like he didn’t know they were getting rid of all the top leaders. But if he really had nothing to do with it, he would have shown up and asked, Where’d everyone go? But he didn’t ask.\n\nThey said we were being fired because we could not be trusted to carry out the president’s agenda. I asked if there was any allegation of misconduct. They said no.\n\nThis was my life, my career, my identity, my calling. It was a privilege to serve the American people. To end it so quickly, it still upsets me.\n\nWhile Patel waited to be confirmed, Bove ordered the acting F.B.I. leadership to create a list of all employees assigned to Jan. 6 investigations “to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.” In response, Driscoll and Kissane sent a survey to employees asking about their roles in those cases.\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: The news hit about the list and the survey, and it was mass chaos. People who worked on real sensitive cases — Jan. 6, the special-counsel investigations, the public-corruption side of the Trump investigation — were packing up their bags and assuming they were about to be fired. People were crying, taking down family pictures from their desks because they were afraid that they wouldn’t be let back in on Monday. This was at the same time that some of the people who worked on those cases were working on the plane crash in the Potomac. They were diving out there finding dead bodies and being told that they were going to be fired.\n\nNorthwest special agent: If you really dig deep down, it’s not just the case agents. Those cases involved a whole host of other people, like surveillance, negotiators, SWAT teams. It’s hard not to have touched one of those cases in some way. Maybe even more so than 9/11, because Jan. 6 was the largest investigation in the history of the bureau.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: Emil Bove did not care that individual agents have no say in what matters they work on. You get assigned investigations. There were many agents who ended up on that list who had misgivings about how aggressively Jan. 6 was investigated. So there was a real sense that there was a sort of random persecution going on rather than actually figuring out who was making operational decisions and assigning responsibility to senior executives.\n\nBove was viewed by the F.B.I. work force not only as somebody whose integrity could not be trusted but as this almost cartoonish figure halfway between a mob enforcer and the grim reaper.\n\n(Bove did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn response to Bove’s demand, Driscoll and Kissane handed over a list of thousands of employees, identified by only their bureau ID numbers, who worked on the Jan. 6 investigations. In response, current and former F.B.I. employees sued the Justice Department, arguing that compiling the list was a violation of privacy that would endanger agents and their families. As a result of the suit, the Justice Department agreed not to release the names of the people on the list.\n\nSenior executive 3: Bove wanted some scalps; he asked for a short list of the main folks. Driscoll and Kissane decided to give them all case participants — everybody got lumped in. They were trying to protect people by flooding the zone.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: A source called me after Jan. 6 saying they saw people they knew posting photos on social media of themselves at the Capitol. I put this in the pipeline at the time through my squad support secretary. Now she’s on the list for pressing send to get this information to the right place.\n\nField-office leader 1: The entire F.B.I. received a bizarre email from Emil Bove. The email described “insubordination” by Acting Director Driscoll and Acting Deputy Director Kissane regarding their refusal to provide names of the Jan. 6 agents. This is part of why Driscoll is a folk hero.\n\n“‘Defend the homeland’ was now on your screen when you logged in. To me, that sounded like a far-right political slogan.”\n\nThe Senate voted 51 to 49 to confirm Patel. Almost immediately, he changed the F.B.I.’s priorities. Under Wray, the bureau had eight stated goals: combating terrorism, organized crime, espionage, public corruption, white-collar crime, cybercrime and violent crime, as well as protecting civil rights. Now Patel stressed four: defend the homeland, rebuild public trust, crush violent crime and ensure fierce organizational accountability.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: “Defend the homeland” was now on your screen when you logged in. To me, that sounded like a far-right political slogan that betrays the F.B.I.’s nonpartisan mission.\n\nWe also had posters on the wall of the F.B.I.’s core values. Someone pulled the diversity poster down. A photo made the rounds of them painting over “diversity” and the other values at Quantico, the F.B.I. academy.\n\nThat was very frustrating, because we spent time on this in training at Quantico. Diversity meant the F.B.I. cared about having people from all walks of life. In Hoover’s time, it was all accountants and lawyers. Now it’s not like that. One of my classmates was a manager at a major appliance company. Others came from D.C. consulting groups. And then there were the military and the police officers.\n\nPhilip Fields, former counterterrorism analyst: The first thing they did was they disbanded our Foreign Influence Task Force. They said that we had to pull back on investigations under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, which applies to people who might be working at the direction of a foreign government without disclosing it. People that I worked with in the counterintelligence program were very upset about a lot of the investigative tools being taken away.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: Shifting priorities away from cyber means less time tracing illicit cryptocurrency transactions, unmasking the identities of cybercriminals and determining their locations around the world, and disrupting nation-state adversaries who target critical infrastructure.\n\nWhen former F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray went before Congress in January 2024, he said that even if we shifted every single F.B.I. agent and analyst to working China cyber, we would be working with one person to 50 Chinese hackers or cyberthreat actors. That’s an insane statistic — and that’s just China.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: I was responsible for the morning intelligence briefing. Every director gets to choose how they want to receive information — how often and in what form. I did everything I could, leading up to Director Patel coming on board, to provide options for how those meetings would run. What type of information do you want? Do you like graphics? Do you like to read? All of that. I wanted to set him up, from Day 1, to make effective decisions.\n\nField-office leader 1: Patel had his first director’s call with the heads of all the field offices. He had no agenda, no organized thoughts, no strategy or leadership philosophy or priorities to share. I specifically remember him saying at one point, “I don’t read.” He explained he didn’t read briefing materials.\n\nSenior executive 2: There was a feeling among many in the F.B.I. that the bureau needed to change. Some believed HQ had gotten too big; metrics and bureaucracy were inhibiting investigations, and resources needed to be better aligned to the threats.\n\nBut what Kash said was basically that every process at the F.B.I. was de facto wrong and would no longer be followed. It came across as contempt for the way former directors had done business and a statement that the former structures would not apply to him.\n\nWith Patel installed, Trump named his pick for deputy director. Rather than choosing a career agent, which had been the practice for most of the F.B.I.’s history, the president selected Dan Bongino, a right-wing podcaster and former Secret Service agent who had described F.B.I. agents as “thugs for the Democrat Party” and called for disbanding the bureau.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: The deputy director oversees daily operations, so it has always been someone who knows the bureau, who has worked their way up, knows the culture, knows policy. Patel had explicitly stated to the F.B.I. Agents Association that he would appoint an in-house F.B.I. special agent, as had been the case for over 100 years.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: When we found out that Dan Bongino was going to be the deputy director, concern reached a fever pitch. We were going to have two people who it would not be an exaggeration to say were conspiracy theorists with very little experience in federal law enforcement.\n\nSenior executive 3: Patel stopped having his weekly meetings with the leaders of the field offices on Wednesdays. There were phone calls from one individual to another, and things were getting missed, things were getting dropped, because they didn’t want to have an email chain.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: Routine internal communications stopped. The director and the deputy got frustrated with media leaks, and they wouldn’t send anything out about people retiring and new people filling their roles or reorganization of the work force. People had to go to social media to see what was going on and who might be next on the chopping block.\n\n(In response to questions about this article, Bongino wrote in an email: “A ‘media’ enterprise that viciously propagated the most destructive political hoax in American history? You guys are jokers, relying on people we likely removed for misfeasance or malfeasance, to feed your ignorant audience the nonsense gruel they crave.”)\n\nPatel directed the F.B.I., which has no immigration-enforcement authority, to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement in conducting raids and making arrests. Field offices began assigning F.B.I. agents and analysts to work immigration shifts, pulling them away from other priorities like counterterrorism, public corruption and white-collar crime.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: We’d been told that when Trump watched footage or saw a picture of a raid, he got mad that he didn’t see F.B.I. raid jackets.\n\nICE was saying they wanted their teams to commingle with our teams. Tactically, you don’t commingle units that haven’t trained together. My bosses said, If we work on immigration, we use our teams and our case info. They put together a list of people already in F.B.I. files we had concerns about, so we’re not just targeting people over their citizenship status.\n\nThey also had to juggle Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who wanted to ride in our tactical vehicle to do her TV stuff. That makes all the operators uneasy, and it makes them less safe.\n\n(The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: I had 20 years’ experience. I was involved in undercover sensitive operations. The bureau hired me for national security, to prevent threats from Al Qaeda and other groups throughout the Near East — not to sit in a parking lot arresting immigrants.\n\nMidwest case agent: I was a grunt agent. I enjoyed trying to take apart large criminal organizations piece by piece.\n\nThey relabeled task forces from drugs to immigration and pushed us toward focusing on deportation versus convictions for actual drug offenses.\n\nUnfortunately, what used to be our focus, long-term investigations, are now short-term hits. You hit the guy carrying the bag, not the guy who made the call, because that’s how you drive up the arrest and prosecution numbers. But the guy carrying the bag, you can’t flip anymore, because he’s getting deported.\n\nBecause F.B.I. agents are posting up with Homeland Security, citizens think we’re part of ICE, which disrupts other investigations. It used to be that you could sit in front of a house, watching another house, and a lot of the time, people were OK with that. They might help you. Now they’re scared.\n\nJill Fields, former supervisory intelligence analyst for violent crime in the Los Angeles field office: They decided they were going to do a big immigration push for one week at the end of February. L.A. is a major transshipment hub for drugs, and you’re going to take people off of cartel cases? They wanted three times the normal number of people in the command post on each shift. I was like, This is too much. I was told that we’ve got to do it for optics. It was to make a show for the president.\n\nI was ordered to have members of my team run a preassessment on some anti-ICE protesters who allegedly had impeded an immigration arrest. F.B.I. policy says that an investigation can’t be opened based on First Amendment-protected activity. The investigative team who analyzed the video determined that the protesters had done nothing wrong; the officers told them to stay back, and they did.\n\nI was told they had to open an investigation anyway. I pushed back, and they said, Jill, you can either get fired today, or you can get fired in four years — meaning when another administration comes in and starts looking into constitutional violations. And I was like: Then fire me today. I’m not doing something that is fundamentally wrong.\n\nI had my squad taken away from me. I was told I was a problem. I was told that the seventh floor was aware of me — the seventh floor means the F.B.I. director’s office. My squad depended on me, and now they have absolutely no top cover anymore. When they took my squad, I was done.\n\n“I was told that we’ve got to do it for optics. It was to make a show for the president.”\n\nPam Bondi, the attorney general, sent a letter to Patel accusing the F.B.I.’s New York field office of holding back thousands of pages of documents in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Hundreds of bureau employees were diverted from their regular duties to review and process more than 100,000 pages, flagging references to Trump and other well-known people as well as redacting information about victims.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: We got this email about a big redaction project — all hands on deck. I thought it was the J.F.K. assassination. Nope. It’s Epstein. Our job is to go through and make sure the computer got the right stuff redacted. We’re working around the clock.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: A member of the redaction team asked me, “Can I not work on this anymore?” They’d had a team call, and Patel jumped on the call and yelled at everyone, telling them to work faster — that he’d fire everyone who worked on the redactions if he didn’t have it when he wanted it.\n\nThe F.B.I. ordered field offices to devote a third of their time to immigration enforcement. Ramping up deportations was the highest priority for Stephen Miller, one of Patel’s key allies.\n\nField-office leader 1: Kash and Dan seemed to have no control over the immigration demands being placed on the F.B.I. Emails sent to F.B.I. field leaders with immigration staffing requirements were forwarded directly from D.O.J.\n\nICE did not have the requisite data or any semblance of a strategic plan to make the F.B.I.’s efforts effective. Each F.B.I. field office was simply told to provide the designated number of F.B.I. agents to the immigration effort.\n\nI remember praying that we didn’t have a terrorist attack, mass shooting or cyberattack slip through the cracks because my agents, who were highly trained to protect against such threats, were assigned to immigration enforcement.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: When you’re taking an agent or analyst who is an expert on the Russian F.S.B. and you have them focused on name checks for immigration enforcement, what investigations are sitting because they’ve been diverted?\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: The immigration push grew immensely, and it grew fast. Leadership was like, This isn’t going away, and all of you will now participate. HQ informed our field offices that the agents out with ICE needed to be taking pictures so they could post them to social media. I had never been asked to do that during an arrest operation before. It’s inappropriate and tactically unsound.\n\nField-office leader 2: I am a conservative. I believe in tightening our borders. I just had an issue with the execution of it. My counterparts at D.H.S. were constantly getting yelled at, being threatened and fearing for their jobs. That’s not the way to work. They literally had quotas. Each region had to have a certain amount of arrests every single day. It was completely asinine.\n\nThis is how things go sideways. For me, the No. 1 priority was agent safety. I don’t want my agent to be killed or to be responsible for somebody else getting killed. I did everything I could to make sure that headquarters is happy, but at the same time, I’m not jeopardizing my agents or my morals or the Constitution either.\n\nNorthwest special agent: In Minneapolis, agents were surveilling a bunch of Somali-run autism centers because it was a kickback scheme. The centers were recruiting kids from the community, falsely diagnosing them and giving the parents a cut of the federal dollars they received for treatment. This became front-page news when the criminal indictments came down, but back in February, agents had to stop investigating for weeks to work immigration. I did not go to law school, go to Quantico and work counterterrorism operations overseas to be doing traffic control for arrest-a-brown-person day.\n\nCentral U.S. case agent: I was working an undercover operation on a neo-Nazi group with a long history of criminal activity. The F.B.I.’s niche in the federal law enforcement community is these specialized investigations, and now we’re being pulled away from those. If I’d wanted to be a cop, I would have just done that. When I resigned from the F.B.I., I was told they’d have to close the investigation — there was no one else around to pick it up.\n\nPatel traveled to Britain to attend a secret conference of the Five Eyes, the intelligence alliance formed after World War II among the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSenior executive 2: Every May, there’s a Five Eyes conference with the head of every intelligence agency. This year it was in the U.K. Kash Patel is going. In the lead-up to that, his detail starts making crazy requests. He’s got special requirements on everything. And the Brits are getting pissed.\n\nBefore the conference, his staff says he’s unhappy because he doesn’t like meetings in office settings. What he wants is social events. He wants Premier soccer games. He wants to go jet skiing. He’d like a helicopter tour. Everyone who heard about this was like: Hold on. Is he really going to ask the MI5 director to go jet skiing instead of meeting? The schedule is set, and every Five Eyes partner is doing this. They can’t just say that he’s not participating and instead he wants to go to a Premier soccer game. This is a job, guys.\n\nHis staff only cared about three things: what his meals were, when his workouts would be and what his entertainment would be. The biggest plan is how he’s going to get his girlfriend in there so she can go to Windsor Castle. He’s got Nicole Rucker as his assistant, like a true executive concierge. And when she’s not getting the food or the workout she wants, she’ll just start screaming at people, Make it happen!\n\nHis staff was briefed multiple times that the Brits were going to want to talk about an F.B.I. position in London that has been pulled. The F.B.I. is arguably their most important partner. MI5 is 5,000 people. The F.B.I. is 38,000. If MI5 ceased to exist, it would be very bad for us. If we cease to exist, it would be an existential threat for them. That person was working on a ton of sensitive stuff, including embassy penetrations and technology, and they want this position back. So Ken McCallum, the MI5 director, goes to Kash Patel at the conference and says: Hey, we really need this position. It’s so important for our mutual benefit. And Kash says: Yep, that person’s going nowhere. She’s absolutely staying. And the Brits rejoice.\n\nTwo weeks later, he reverses himself and removes her. The Brits are outraged. Kash will make promises and he will break them, and he doesn’t worry about that.\n\nOn that trip, the heads of intelligence for the Five Eyes went to Windsor Castle and met with the king. There was a photo taken of all the Five Eyes people, some of whom are nondisclosed, meaning their affiliation with the British intelligence service isn’t public. The Brits forwarded that picture as a keepsake for the individuals. They prefaced it with, This isn’t to be shared. But Kash has decided he wants to post it on social media. They have people trying to negotiate with the Brits about whether that’s possible. They’re fighting with the director’s office, like: You cannot post this. Do not do that. And they’re arguing, He wants a picture out.\n\n(The F.B.I. did not respond to questions about this trip.)\n\n“The feeling I have more is unremitting anger at the executives who have taken an oath to the Constitution and are making moral compromises on a daily basis.”\n\nMichael Feinberg, a leader of the F.B.I.’s field office in Norfolk, Va., was forced out after Bongino discovered he was friends with Peter Strzok, an agent fired in 2018 for disparaging Trump while investigating his campaign’s ties to Russia. In a text exchange, Strzok called Trump an “idiot,” and he responded to another text about Trump’s presidential run by saying, “We’ll stop it.” (In response to a request for comment, Strzok noted that the Justice Department’s inspector general found that political bias did not influence decision-making in the Russia investigation.)\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: I was at the field office working out in the gym on a Saturday, and I got a phone call from Dominique Evans, my newly appointed special agent in charge. She was on a cruise in Europe, and I was leading the office in her absence. She told me that Dan Bongino had somehow found out that I was friends with Pete Strzok. I explained to her that Pete and I had worked together in the counterintelligence division before there was any scandal associated with his name. We discovered we were into the same bands and became friends. I wasn’t breaking any policy by going to see Nick Cave and Warren Ellis with him.\n\nDominique says she’s going to get back to Bongino. When she calls me back, she says that Bongino is not satisfied with my explanation and that he’s going to talk with Patel about it. She calls me back again later, and I ask her just to be square with me. I explain I love my job, I care deeply about the organization and, personally, I have a wife in the middle of a high-risk pregnancy. What exactly is going to happen to me?\n\nAnd she says: You’re probably going to be demoted. You should expect to get polygraphed or investigated about your relationship with Pete. And I am immediately removing you as acting special agent in charge in my absence.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of hanging up with her, I knew that I was going to quit. I took an oath to the Constitution, as idealistic as that sounds, and the point of an oath is that you follow it regardless of personal consequences. I was being targeted for blatantly political reasons. I don’t want to sound like a boy scout, but we have to be an apolitical organization that does things by the book. We have the power to deprive people of their freedom. And in some circumstances, we have the power to deprive people of their lives.\n\n(An F.B.I. spokesman said employees have been forced out only for behaving unethically or failing to deliver on the agency’s mission. He declined to comment on specific firings, including Feinberg’s.)\n\nTo be hired by the bureau and receive a security clearance, most F.B.I. personnel must pass a polygraph test, during which they are asked about foreign contacts, drug use and serious criminal conduct. The bureau also administers polygraphs to agents working on highly classified investigations and to agents accused of misconduct. The New York Times revealed that Patel was ramping up the F.B.I.’s use of polygraphs to crack down on media leaks and ensure loyalty to him personally. One question frequently asked was whether employees had said anything negative about the director.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: I worked counterintelligence and espionage cases my entire career. The polygraph is voodoo science. The bureau doesn’t predicate cases on a polygraph — it’s just an indicator. People fail a poly for lots of reasons. It puts somebody in the position of being very nervous. It’s purposely stressful.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: They were polygraphing their own senior leadership team because they were so mad about media leaks. Each assistant director, as head of division, had to identify two people in our division to polygraph. Many of us volunteered ourselves and then asked one of our deputies so we wouldn’t have to put it on our people.\n\nDawn E. Morrow, former senior human-resources manager: One of my employees got polygraphed for being in a meeting where apparently something was leaked. The way they were being used when I left was as a weapon, almost a punishment.\n\nA gunman opened fire outside CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Mich. He shot and wounded one person before being killed by the church’s security staff.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: ​​Bongino called the field office in Detroit. In the normal course of business, if the deputy director calls at a moment like that, they’re asking: How can we help? What do you need? They can turn on all the resources of the organization. But Bongino called and asked, What can I tweet about this?\n\nThe field office has to be careful — this is their boss. But the body was still there. They said, We’ll get back to you. But Bongino kept calling back, asking, What can I tweet?\n\n(Bongino declined to respond to questions about this specific event and others.)\n\nTonya Ugoretz, the head of intelligence at the F.B.I., was removed from her position.\n\nHer dismissal came after Senator Chuck Grassley — an Iowa Republican and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which conducts oversight of the intelligence agencies — requested information from the F.B.I. about a years-old intelligence report. The report contained a secondhand tip that the Chinese government was creating fake IDs to cast votes for Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe F.B.I. provided Grassley with emails from agents debating the report, which was ultimately withdrawn amid doubts about its credibility. In one email, an F.B.I. employee wrongly identified Ugoretz as the official who ordered the withdrawal.\n\nIn another email, an analyst expressed concern that the report might have been suppressed for political reasons. Marshall Yates, the head of the F.B.I.’s office of congressional affairs, who provided the emails, wrote to Grassley endorsing the idea that the report was suppressed.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: For whatever reason, my name was mentioned as one of two officials who told the Albany field office, which issued that report, to recall it. It wasn’t true. I was in the cyber division then, so it wouldn’t have been my role. When I found out, I spoke to my supervisor. We met with Bongino that day. I was told it was out of his hands. I wasn’t sure what that meant.\n\nThe next afternoon, I was placed on administrative leave. I was told that was because the F.B.I. didn’t want to have to explain to Grassley’s office why the person named in the emails was the current head of intelligence.\n\nI heard that other F.B.I. leaders were stunned and asking for some kind of due process. Our inspection division contacted me and said they were going to conduct a strategic review — an internal investigation of the Albany field report and whether senior leadership, above me at the highest levels, directed this intelligence to be buried. I was interviewed twice for that and polygraphed.\n\nIn October, I got a call to discuss my options. I had to ask — What did the review show? The official I met with said he hadn’t read it, but his understanding was the review found no misconduct by me or related to the recall of the report.\n\nI asked, If the review found I did nothing wrong, why can’t I return to my position? I was given the standard line: It’s at the director’s discretion to reassign senior executives, which is true. The only options I was given were demotions. I decided to leave.\n\nI’m just one person in a series of senior officials who were disappeared. I can’t think of a better word for it. Heads of field offices would be there one day and gone the next.\n\nI’m a firm believer in the oversight function of Congress. Conducting intelligence missions in a democracy, as the F.B.I. does, requires oversight and accountability. ​​It’s hard to say that providing materials to Congress is bad. But in my case, sharing the documents without having done any work to explain whether an allegation was true or false — how does that help Congress in its oversight mission?\n\nWhat it does do is create fear among the work force. They lose the trust in their own agency to have their back.\n\n“They were polygraphing their own senior leadership team because they were so mad about media leaks.”\n\nPatel fired Brian Driscoll, the former acting director who had been leading the crisis-response group after Patel’s confirmation, and Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office. Evans had been brought to Patel’s attention by Kyle Seraphin, a podcaster and former F.B.I. agent who was suspended by the bureau in 2022.\n\n“He’s fucked.” (Driscoll and Evans have alleged wrongful termination in a pending lawsuit against the F.B.I.)\n\nPublic-corruption agent: Seraphin and other agents who have been suspended are out there on social media with the credibility of being former F.B.I. agents. If you can say, I’m the victim because of this guy Spencer Evans, and then he gets fired, it increases your credibility. People see that and think, Maybe they’re correct, and the whole system is corrupt — even if most of it is nonsense.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: The downside of having folks scared about losing their jobs is that you go from being an organization where people come in and do the work to spending time keeping their head down or on LinkedIn looking for jobs.\n\nI want to sound the alarm about how this affects Americans’ safety. I’ve seen it up close, where we have stopped stuff Americans will never know about. The F.B.I. doesn’t do a good job, in my opinion, of highlighting the number of things it stops. There’s a concern about scaring people; you don’t want to make people feel under dire threat all the time. But thousands of attacks stopped over a few years is normal. That depends, though, on people doing the work.\n\n“I assumed Congress would see how uniquely unqualified Kash Patel was for the job.”\n\nPatel fired Walter Giardina, an agent from the elite public-corruption squad in Washington known as CR-15 that ran Arctic Frost, the investigation into Trump for interference in the 2020 election.\n\nTwo months earlier, Grassley had sent Patel and Bondi a letter containing misconduct allegations against Giardina made by unnamed whistle-blowers. They included a claim that Giardina had corroborated the Steele dossier, a set of later-discredited memos about Trump’s ties to Russia in 2016.\n\nGrassley named Giardina in the letter despite the bureau’s standard practice of protecting case agents by asking Congress to redact their names from sensitive disclosures. (Clare Slattery, a spokeswoman for Grassley, said in a statement that it is his “longstanding office policy to leave names unredacted in public document productions” because “Americans deserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent.”)\n\nGiardina tried to meet with Yates, the head of the office of congressional affairs, to contest the allegations and explain that he never had access to the Steele dossier.\n\nWalter Giardina, former CR-15 agent: ​​I took a lot of pride in being trusted with difficult assignments. Until this year, public corruption was the No. 1 criminal priority of the F.B.I. The people you’re going after may be powerful, and they can come after you in asymmetric ways.\n\nWhen Senator Grassley wrote a letter naming me to the director as the person behind the Steele dossier, that was punching all the way down. I don’t know of any other time that a senator wrote a letter attacking an individual street-level agent. I’m begging my managers and the office of congressional affairs to meet with me to sort out this situation — for me personally, but also for the F.B.I. as a whole. It would take one second to look at the case access history and see that I never even had access to the Steele matter. I had nothing to do with that.\n\nMy wife was in and out of the hospital from June 5 to July 15, when she passed away. During that time, I kept trying to meet with the office of congressional affairs about responding to Grassley’s letter. On June 19, we had a meeting set at the Hoover Building. My wife had just started a new chemo medication. She had a terrible adverse reaction, and I said I was having family health concerns and asked to do the meeting via Teams, which would be pretty normal. They immediately canceled it. When I asked why, the answer was that Marshall Yates wanted to do the meeting not as an interview but as a mock hearing.\n\nI didn’t know my wife was about to pass away. I reserved a conference room at the hospital to meet the office of congressional affairs next to her room, so they could interview me. They didn’t show up. She died the next day.\n\nAt my insistence, I was finally interviewed two days after her funeral. I said: I don’t want anyone to tell me it’s too soon. I won’t be emotional. I want to get this over with. I knew the interview was messed up because Marshall Yates wasn’t present. I had a prepared statement with all the facts. I gave it to them. They didn’t ask any questions. I sent all the records they asked for. Then it was over. They’d already decided to fire me, so no one was taking the interview seriously except me.\n\nIn CR-15, we worked the cases we were assigned. It was not my idea to open Arctic Frost. We were detailed to Jack Smith. The supervisors came to us and said, You’re going to do this. We’re losing the ability for agents to conduct their work without fear or favor because the F.B.I. won’t protect you.\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: Walter was one of the most heartbreaking ones, because it was the week after he buried his wife. She had cancer, and then he gets hit with this. I was at a happy hour at the Irish Channel, sitting outside with some other agents. And it was like: Oh, my god. How do we support him? How do we get food to him? Because he’s on his own with three kids.\n\nBlaire Toleman, former supervisory special agent for CR-15: My team always did the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons. But the F.B.I. fired some of them for no reason, with no internal investigation we knew of. To fire my colleagues like that was shocking. I thought, Shouldn’t it just be me, not the people I assigned to work on a case? I had huge grief about them.\n\nWe all worked in an agency where the truth was paramount. I said, People in the F.B.I. will follow the facts. We were waiting and waiting for that to happen.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: CR-15 is a storied squad. Walter and Blaire, like others, were chosen for the squad because they were exceptionally talented and experienced investigators. They could not tell you the breakdown of the political affiliations of the subjects they investigated. They were two of the best agents I’ve ever worked with, and I’ve worked with a lot of great ones.\n\nThe F.B.I. is accountable for what it accomplishes or fails to accomplish as an agency. We don’t attach responsibility to individual case agents, who don’t even get to choose what cases they’re working.\n\nCharlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a university in Utah. Hours later, Patel told his 1.8 million followers on X that a suspect had been detained, only to backtrack shortly afterward. Patel then flew to Utah to personally oversee the investigation.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: I’ve run so many command posts for major attacks. You don’t know in the initial aftermath what’s going on, but you should be able to say to bosses, “We think there are five suspects,” or “We think it’s this one person,” and know that the information won’t leave that conference room. Because it could be wrong. Often, in the beginning, it is wrong.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: Now social media dominates and controls the perception of what we should be doing. It’s incredibly hard — whether you’re an operational support technician or a special agent or op assistant director — not to let it get to you. It’s all we’re hearing.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: When he landed in Salt Lake City, Patel didn’t have a raid jacket and reportedly ordered people to go find him one. He needed a size medium. They found him a female’s jacket that didn’t have the patches that he wanted, so he had the SWAT team taking their patches off to put on his jacket before he would go to the press conference. I haven’t worn my raid jacket since Quantico, in 20 years of my career. You just don’t wear it, especially in a leadership position.\n\nSenior executive 2: Whenever there’s a critical incident, one of the first things that happens is a conference call with everybody — all the executives, most of the field offices dial in. The director rarely speaks, because someone with situational awareness is leading the call. They’ll say: Here’s what happened. Here’s what we know. Here’s what we need. But we get on, and it’s just Kash berating the special agent in charge in Salt Lake. He’s super emotional.\n\nAnd then it turns surreal. He and Bongino start talking about their Twitter strategy. And Kash is like: I’m gonna tweet this. Salt Lake, you tweet that. Dan, you come in with this. Then I’ll come back with this. They’re literally scripting out their social media, not talking about how we’re going to respond or resources or the situation. He’s screaming that he wants to put stuff out, but it’s not even vetted yet. It’s not even accurate.\n\nWhen I was an agent, I did hundreds of these cases. The initial information that comes in is always wrong. There’s too much coming in, and it takes time to vet. And it was obvious that Kash can’t understand that and doesn’t want to understand that.\n\nEveryone on the call is just like: This guy is completely out of control. On another call, he said: When a crisis happens, the only thing you need to do is call me. The most important thing in any crisis is controlling the narrative. I was like: No, no, no. We actually have to do some work here. We’re going to have to investigate, to solve this.\n\nIn a congressional hearing, Patel was questioned about his and Bongino’s decision to change the bureau’s fitness test for new agents, replacing situps with pull-ups. Senator Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, pointed out that the increased emphasis on upper-body strength could make the test disproportionately harder for women because of differences in physiology. Patel replied that the new test was appropriate for agents in the field who “have to chase down bad guys and do really hard work.” The F.B.I. went forward with adding pull-ups to the test, scoring men and women differently.\n\nSenior executive 3: Bongino wanted to establish a new physical-fitness test without any evidence-based research. He wanted to have men and women do the exact same pull-ups, which all of the data said would lead to losing a number of female recruits and potentially female agents that hadn’t been tested for pull-ups before.\n\nWhen he was informed of that, Bongino said, You can have the best female agent take down the biggest case in our history, but if on the Ring door-camera video she’s out of shape or overweight, that’s going to be the story. He was worried about whether or not they’d look good on a doorbell camera. He said it’s the way these times are.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: I score really high on the physical-fitness test. I coached sports. I can do pull-ups when I train for them. But there was still a feeling of diminished value. The test should actually be reflective of our daily duties.\n\n“Our motto is ‘Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity.’ I hope and pray one day they will have upper leadership that embodies that.”\n\nThe F.B.I. fired a group of agents who were photographed kneeling during a Black Lives Matter protest in the summer of 2020. A dozen of those agents later sued the F.B.I. for wrongful termination, claiming that the crowd had backed them against a wall and was throwing objects. They knelt, they said, “to defuse a volatile situation, not as an expressive political act.”\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: Three of the people in that picture had worked for me. We’re not cops, despite what Kash Patel says. We’re investigators. We gather evidence and build cases. That summer, we were put on the street to handle riots. And we were never, ever trained to do that. Cops have batons. They have pepper spray. They have all sorts of other tools for crowd control. What we have are our voices and our guns. These agents were surrounded and made a decision to de-escalate the situation. And that was, in my opinion, the right choice.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: The firings were a reaction to people online calling them Kneel Team Six. That incident was investigated by F.B.I. leadership, and the agents were cleared. Then Kash Patel comes in and reopens the whole thing. They were cleared again, but Patel fired them anyway.\n\nPatel dismissed David Maltinsky, an F.B.I. agent in training, who had displayed a Pride flag at his desk when he worked for the bureau as a tactical specialist in Los Angeles. Maltinsky was three weeks from his graduation at Quantico.\n\nDavid Maltinsky, former tactical specialist and agent trainee: My aunt and uncle are in law enforcement — my aunt is a retired special agent — and I aspired to carry out that same mission. So when I applied and was accepted at Quantico, I was accomplishing my life’s goal.\n\nI was in the dorms with my squad when I heard that my supervisor needed to talk to me. She and I were led into a conference room. Then the executives walked in and sat down. One of them said, David, there’s no other way to say this, but you are being terminated effective today. He handed me a letter that said I had “exercised poor judgment with an inappropriate display of political signage” in my work station in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2021, the F.B.I. approved Pride flags to fly in front of federal buildings. At the end of Pride month that year, the flag that had flown outside the L.A. field office was given to me by bureau leaders to maintain. Other gay F.B.I. employees texted me to say how incredible it was to see it up there. It wasn’t that long ago that being gay meant you couldn’t get a security clearance — you couldn’t have a job at the F.B.I. It was 1993 before you could serve openly.\n\nReading the letter, I was thinking this may be connected to a complaint that my supervisor got after the inauguration. An employee who worked on another floor claimed the flag was now in violation of President Trump’s executive order banning D.E.I. The flag had been on my desk for years at that point. My supervisor reassured me that it didn’t violate anything in his view. He said: Keep it up. You don’t need to take it down. But somehow word of the Pride flag reached Kash Patel.\n\nOne of the executives asked me where I was going to go that night, and I told him I had nowhere to go. It was so quiet in that room. You could see in their faces that they thought this was awful. They said, You could stay another night if you need to plan and pack. I appreciated that, but if the directive was for me to leave, I’m going to leave.\n\nGrassley released documents showing that F.B.I. agents working on Arctic Frost subpoenaed the Jan. 6 call logs of nine Republican members of Congress. The logs did not include the content of the conversations, but Grassley said that the subpoenas amounted to spying and that Arctic Frost was “arguably worse than Watergate.”\n\nPatel then fired two more agents who worked on Arctic Frost. He also shut down the CR-15 public-corruption squad. “You’re darn right I fired those agents,” Patel said that night on Fox News. “You’re darn right I blew up CR-15.”\n\nPublic-corruption agent: “Vendetta” is the best word for what they’re doing. I’ve tried to figure out where the vitriol comes from. I think it’s partisanship.\n\nFrom a basic investigative standpoint, if you’re looking into a possible conspiracy and you want to know who that person might have reached out to on a particular date or time, then seeking subpoenas for call records is a reasonable and logical step. We’re talking only about the in-and-out numbers and the date, time and length of the calls. Obtaining that information is such a basic tenet of an investigation. And sometimes you get it and you find out it means absolutely nothing. It helps you rule something out.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: There are rules surrounding grand-jury material to protect the integrity of an investigation as well as people’s privacy and civil liberties. These proceedings are normally kept secret. Documents in a case file are part of a pending investigation, and more action is needed to corroborate the evidence. It’s problematic to release this material without context.\n\nPatel flew on an F.B.I. jet to a wrestling event in Pennsylvania, where his girlfriend, the country singer Alexis Wilkins, was performing the national anthem. The pair then took the plane to Nashville, where Wilkins lives. That weekend, Patel again used the jet for personal travel, this time for a trip to Boondoggle Ranch, a hunting resort in Texas that is owned by a major Republican donor.\n\nKyle Seraphin, the former agent and podcaster who previously supported Patel, posted some of the flight records on X and criticized him for flying at taxpayer expense during a government shutdown. Patel reportedly blamed Steven Palmer, an agent who oversaw the bureau’s aviation assets, for the bad publicity and fired him.\n\nField-office leader 2: There’s a $545 million budget cut for the bureau. Meanwhile, you’re spending millions of dollars just gallivanting. How do you justify that?\n\nSenior executive 2: Whenever the girlfriend is going to sing the national anthem at some wrestling event or some National Rifle Association or Turning Point event, they’re calling the local SWAT team, saying, You’re going to guard her. Meanwhile, in Nashville, those poor bastards — their SWAT team has actually been converted to her protection. They’re not even doing their own SWAT arrests anymore. They’ve got to bring in other teams to do that, because they’re guarding her all the time.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: This is among the reasons William Sessions lost his job when he was F.B.I. director — for allegedly misusing government planes and having agents run errands for his wife. That was the 1990s. Since then, having a SWAT team protect an F.B.I. director’s family member or girlfriend — to my knowledge, that didn’t happen when the director wasn’t present. And I spent more than half my career in tactical positions, including three years in which I had programmatic control of every F.B.I. SWAT team.\n\nPatel fired four more agents who worked on Arctic Frost after Grassley released documents from whistle-blowers naming them.\n\nCoordination between Grassley and the F.B.I.’s office of congressional affairs was unusually close throughout the year. Marshall Yates, the head of the O.C.A., and his team combed through the F.B.I.’s files to identify agents they thought were biased, according to congressional aides. Former law-enforcement officials believe these agents are among those whose names Grassley is making public, bypassing the F.B.I.’s protections for employees. (A Grassley spokeswoman said his disclosures followed the rules and were thoroughly vetted over months or years.)\n\nYates and Rosemaria Marketos, a former CR-15 agent working with him, were also members of the Weaponization Working Group, a task force created by Bondi to address “abuses of the criminal-justice process” during the Biden administration.\n\nChristopher O’Leary, former senior executive in the counterterrorism division: The irony of the name “weaponization group” is rich. They are doing what they said the Biden administration did. If the weaponization group and the office of congressional affairs have merged at a certain level, that is very problematic for two reasons. First, this merger abandons the F.B.I.’s history of being unbiased. Second, O.C.A. becomes another bullhorn for this administration’s political narrative. The people paying the price are the public servants in the F.B.I. and D.O.J., and more broadly, the American people.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: It’s concerning to me that senior officials are saying agents from the Department of Homeland Security need to wear masks to avoid being doxxed, while the names of F.B.I. agents are being read aloud in Congress, which can lead to the same risks. I’ve not seen a public defense of these agents, which may be the unfortunate result of the removal of so much of the F.B.I.’s senior leadership.\n\nIn a final blow to CR-15, Patel fired Blaire Toleman, who was in charge of the squad when it investigated Trump.\n\nBlaire Toleman, former supervisory special agent for CR-15: In my years of service, I never so much as got a stern talking-to. I got a call saying I’d receive a letter by the end of the day that I was no longer employed with the F.B.I. I was at a training. I asked if I had to drive to the office to turn my stuff in. Yes, I did. My squad helped me pack up my office. My wife picked me up. Quite a few people, around 40, walked me out.\n\nOn the way home, I got a call that I might not be getting fired. Then I got another call two hours later: You’re definitely not fired. Then the next day, I got fired again. My letter of termination said I was being fired due to my lack of judgment, leading to the weaponization of the government. In reality, they were firing us because they didn’t like the case we worked.\n\nA lot of people in the bureau are pissed about what’s happening, but they will step up to try to make sure the American people remain safe, because that’s our job. When I was getting walked out, I told my squad and the other people with me: Keep your heads up. Don’t let the American people suffer.\n\nIn a leaked memo, Bondi tasked the F.B.I. with compiling a list of “domestic terrorism organizations” in response to a presidential memorandum in September that ordered federal law enforcement to prioritize domestic threats, particularly antifa.\n\n“Common threads animating this violent conduct,” the presidential memorandum stated, “include anti-Americanism, anticapitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States government; extremism on migration, race and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion and morality.”\n\nAt a congressional hearing in September, Patel testified that the bureau had increased the number of domestic terror investigations opened that year by 300 percent.\n\nPhilip Fields, former counterterrorism analyst: Antifa is not an organization. It is a loosely formulated ideology. Designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization blurs the lines between investigating national-security threats and First Amendment-protected activity. The broadness of the language suggests that the lines could get blurred between left-wing extremist groups and advocacy groups for left-aligned policies.\n\nNational-security intelligence analyst: The bureau is still dealing with the reputation it acquired under Hoover, when he oversaw a vast domestic surveillance network and the F.B.I. maintained dossiers on huge numbers of people not suspected of crimes. The malfeasance of the ’60s and ’70s is really drilled into us at Quantico. I think a lot of people reading Bondi’s memo very reasonably interpreted it as meaning they want a return to Hoover. I know that across the institution, people are very uncomfortable with that language.\n\n“People that I worked with in the counterintelligence program were very upset about a lot of the investigative tools being taken away.”\n\nAs the Trump administration approached its one-year mark, Patel promoted the bureau’s success in fighting crime under his leadership. On X, he claimed a “100% increase” in year-to-year arrests and a “210% increase” in the disruption of gangs and criminal enterprises. “This FBI is saving lives,” he wrote, “protecting innocent kids, and taking deadly drugs off our streets at levels not seen in decades.”\n\nSenior executive 3: The F.B.I. is bilking their numbers. F.B.I. agents are walking around providing support for local police and ICE. If the local police or ICE makes an arrest, the F.B.I. is counting it in their stats. One example I heard: An F.B.I. agent was walking around with a couple cops who arrested someone for shoplifting, and the F.B.I. claimed it as an arrest. It used to be that the main thing that we would capture in our own arrest stats was if the F.B.I. was the lead agency and it was a federal charge. It hurts me to say it, but they’re bullshit numbers.\n\nCentral U.S. case agent: Let’s say the Highway Patrol pulls somebody over. There’s a gun in the car. Well, then all of a sudden an F.B.I. car shows up, a D.E.A. car shows up, an A.T.F. car shows up. They run the gun and see if it’s stolen. They run the person and see if he’s a felon. Oh, he’s a felon? OK, great. Now the F.B.I. and the A.T.F. and the D.E.A. are all going to say that they got an arrest because they showed up just to balloon the numbers.\n\nField Office Leader 1: When you make F.B.I. agents street cops, you get street-cop numbers. We didn’t used to count immigration arrests, because we didn’t do immigration. Now we do. We didn’t do street patrols in D.C. in the past. Now we do.\n\nIn the past, we mostly worked the complex investigations the F.B.I. is famous for. Complicated work with wires and sophisticated techniques — all aimed at taking out the entire criminal enterprises or national security threats. Now, under Kash, we are counting stuff that has been historically left to local police departments and other agencies and saying, Wow, look at us.\n\n(An F.B.I. spokesman disputed these accounts. “The FBI ONLY counts state arrests when we work cases jointly from partners,” he wrote. “Since becoming director, Patel’s focus has been on partner engagements and joint operations, we do it together.”)\n\nIn the days after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis, the Trump administration blocked state and local officials from reviewing the evidence. Justice Department officials, including Patel, steered the F.B.I. away from a civil rights investigation into whether the ICE agent used excessive force. Instead, Patel ordered an investigation into local activist groups and Good’s wife. Six federal prosecutors resigned in protest. The Justice Department also began criminally investigating Democratic officials in the state, including Governor Tim Walz and the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: The F.B.I. has closed and cleared civil rights investigations without officers being charged when there’s no evidence to substantiate a charge. The way to ascertain the truth is to conduct a fair and impartial investigation. But when government officials communicate on social media about their perception of the events, and many agents have been fired over the outcome of cases they worked, that could have negative impact on this investigation.\n\nJill Fields, former supervisory intelligence analyst for violent crime in the Los Angeles field office: I’ve seen multiple videos of protesters being arrested who aren’t impeding immigration enforcement. Yes, they’re yelling, they’re taunting, but that’s their right. This is what I was worried about and why I pushed back when the L.A. office was asked to investigate protesters last year. It was unthinkable to me then, and now it’s happening. If you start arresting or investigating people for exercising their First Amendment rights, then they don’t have those rights.\n\nThe F.B.I. will literally open an investigation into a bureau car accident, so the idea that they haven’t opened a civil rights investigation after an agent-involved shooting — that’s shocking.\n\nChristopher Raia, a career agent who was previously in charge of the New York field office, was named to replace Bongino, who stepped down in December. Raia shares the role of deputy director with Andrew Bailey, a former Missouri attorney general who moved to the F.B.I. in September. Later, Raia posted on X: “I know the FBI will continue to accomplish great things in the year ahead.”\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: ​​What I feel is not just disappointment at the way Patel and Bongino have changed the bureau. The feeling I have more is unremitting anger at the executives who have taken an oath to the Constitution and are making moral compromises on a daily basis to advance their careers. I know some of them are undoubtedly thinking that we need to make some compromises in order to save the F.B.I. as an institution. But the F.B.I. doesn’t matter because it exists as a building on Pennsylvania Avenue. The F.B.I. matters because of the ideals and principles it is supposed to uphold. And if the building continues to exist but those principles and ideals are thrown aside, the victory in saving the F.B.I. has been completely Pyrrhic.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: I resigned when it became clear to me that F.B.I. leadership was undermining the bureau’s mission and pursuit of justice. But I don’t expect anyone to make the same decision that I did. I have the most profound respect for my colleagues that are still there.

    "description": "All complex correlated systems, from Arctic melt ponds to the Internet, appear to be governed by the same math as a random matrix.",
    "fullText": "In 1999, while sitting at a bus stop in Cuernavaca, Mexico, a Czech physicist named Petr Šeba noticed young men handing slips of paper to the bus drivers in exchange for cash. It wasn’t organized crime, he learned, but another shadow trade: Each driver paid a “spy” to record when the bus ahead of his had departed the stop. If it had left recently, he would slow down, letting passengers accumulate at the next stop. If it had departed long ago, he sped up to keep other buses from passing him. This system maximized profits for the drivers. And it gave Šeba an idea.\n\n“We felt here some kind of similarity with quantum chaotic systems,” explained Šeba’s co-author, Milan Krbálek, in an email.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to talk to the spies himself, Šeba asked his student to explain to them that he wasn’t a tax collector, or a criminal — he was simply a “crazy” scientist willing to trade tequila for their data. The men handed over their used papers. When the researchers plotted thousands of bus departure times on a computer, their suspicions were confirmed: The interaction between drivers caused the spacing between departures to exhibit a distinctive pattern previously observed in quantum physics experiments.\n\n“I was thinking that something like this could come out, but I was really surprised that it comes exactly,” Šeba said.\n\nSubatomic particles have little to do with decentralized bus systems. But in the years since the odd coupling was discovered, the same pattern has turned up in other unrelated settings. Scientists now believe the widespread phenomenon, known as “universality,” stems from an underlying connection to mathematics, and it is helping them to model complex systems from the Internet to Earth’s climate.\n\nThe pattern was first discovered in nature in the 1950s in the energy spectrum of the uranium nucleus, a behemoth with hundreds of moving parts that quivers and stretches in infinitely many ways, producing an endless sequence of energy levels. In 1972, the number theorist Hugh Montgomery observed it in the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, a mathematical object closely related to the distribution of prime numbers. In 2000, Krbálek and Šeba reported it in the Cuernavaca bus system. And in recent years it has shown up in spectral measurements of composite materials, such as sea ice and human bones, and in signal dynamics of the Erdös–Rényi model, a simplified version of the Internet named for Paul Erdös and Alfréd Rényi.\n\nEach of these systems has a spectrum — a sequence like a bar code representing data such as energy levels, zeta zeros, bus departure times or signal speeds. In all the spectra, the same distinctive pattern appears: The data seem haphazardly distributed, and yet neighboring lines repel one another, lending a degree of regularity to their spacing. This fine balance between chaos and order, which is defined by a precise formula, also appears in a purely mathematical setting: It defines the spacing between the eigenvalues, or solutions, of a vast matrix filled with random numbers.\n\n“Why so many physical systems behave like random matrices is still a mystery,” said Horng-Tzer Yau, a mathematician at Harvard University. “But in the past three years, we have made a very important step in our understanding.”\n\n“It seems to be a law of nature,” said Van Vu, a mathematician at Yale University who, with Terence Tao of the University of California, Los Angeles, has proven universality for a broad class of random matrices.\n\nUniversality is thought to arise when a system is very complex, consisting of many parts that strongly interact with each other to generate a spectrum. The pattern emerges in the spectrum of a random matrix, for example, because the matrix elements all enter into the calculation of that spectrum. But random matrices are merely “toy systems” that are of interest because they can be rigorously studied, while also being rich enough to model real-world systems, Vu said. Universality is much more widespread. Wigner’s hypothesis (named after Eugene Wigner, the physicist who discovered universality in atomic spectra) asserts that all complex, correlated systems exhibit universality, from a crystal lattice to the Internet.\n\nThe more complex a system is, the more robust its universality should be, said László Erdös of the University of Munich, one of Yau’s collaborators. “This is because we believe that universality is the typical behavior.”\n\nIn many simple systems, individual components can assert too great an influence on the outcome of the system, changing the spectral pattern. With larger systems, no single component dominates. “It’s like if you have a room with a lot of people and they decide to do something, the personality of one person isn’t that important,” Vu said.\n\nWhenever a system exhibits universality, the behavior acts as a signature certifying that the system is complex and correlated enough to be treated like a random matrix. “This means you can use a random matrix to model it,” Vu said. “You can compute other parameters of the matrix model and use them to predict that the system may behave like the parameters you computed.”\n\nThis technique is enabling scientists to understand the structure and evolution of the Internet. Certain properties of this vast computer network, such as the typical size of a cluster of computers, can be closely estimated by measurable properties of the corresponding random matrix. “People are very interested in clusters and their locations, partially motivated by practical purposes such as advertising,” Vu said.\n\nA similar technique may lead to improvements in climate change models. Scientists have found that the presence of universality in features similar to the energy spectrum of a material indicates that its components are highly connected, and that it will therefore conduct fluids, electricity or heat. Conversely, the absence of universality may show that a material is sparse and acts as an insulator. In new work presented in January at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego, Calif., Ken Golden, a mathematician at the University of Utah, and his student, Ben Murphy, used this distinction to predict heat transfer and fluid flow in sea ice, both at the microscopic level and through patchworks of Arctic melt ponds spanning thousands of kilometers.\n\nThe spectral measure of a mosaic of melt ponds, taken from a helicopter, or a similar measurement taken of a sample of sea ice in an ice core, instantly exposes the state of either system. “Fluid flow through sea ice governs or mediates very important processes that you need to understand in order to understand the climate system,” Golden said. “The transitions in the eigenvalue statistics presents a brand new, mathematically rigorous approach to incorporating sea ice into climate models.”\n\nThe same trick may also eventually provide an easy test for osteoporosis. Golden, Murphy and their colleagues have found that the spectrum of a dense, healthy bone exhibits universality, while that of a porous, osteoporotic bone does not.\n\n“We’re dealing with systems where the ‘particles’ can be on the millimeter or even on the kilometer scale,” Murphy said, referring to the systems’ component parts. “It’s amazing that the same underlying mathematics describes both.”\n\nThe reason a real-world system would exhibit the same spectral behavior as a random matrix may be easiest to understand in the case of the nucleus of a heavy atom. All quantum systems, including atoms, are governed by the rules of mathematics, and specifically by those of matrices. “That’s what quantum mechanics is all about,” said Freeman Dyson, a retired mathematical physicist who helped develop random matrix theory in the 1960s and 1970s while at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. “Every quantum system is governed by a matrix representing the total energy of the system, and the eigenvalues of the matrix are the energy levels of the quantum system.”\n\nThe matrices behind simple atoms, such as hydrogen or helium, can be worked out exactly, yielding eigenvalues that correspond with stunning precision to the measured energy levels of the atoms. But the matrices corresponding to more complex quantum systems, such as a uranium nucleus, quickly grow too thorny to grasp. According to Dyson, this is why such nuclei can be compared to random matrices. Many of the interactions inside uranium — the elements of its unknown matrix — are so complex that they become washed out, like a mélange of sounds blending into noise. Consequently, the unknown matrix that governs the nucleus behaves like a matrix filled with random numbers, and so its spectrum exhibits universality.\n\nScientists have yet to develop an intuitive understanding of why this particular random-yet-regular pattern, and not some other pattern, emerges for complex systems. “We only know it from calculations,” Vu said. Another mystery is what it has to do with the Riemann zeta function, whose spectrum of zeros exhibits universality. The zeros of the zeta function are closely tied to the distribution of the prime numbers — the irreducible integers out of which all others are constructed. Mathematicians have long wondered at the haphazard way in which the primes are sprinkled along the number line from one to infinity, and universality offers a clue. Some think there may be a matrix underlying the Riemann zeta function that is complex and correlated enough to exhibit universality. Discovering such a matrix would have “big implications” for finally understanding the distribution of the primes, said Paul Bourgade, a mathematician at Harvard.\n\nOr perhaps the explanation lies deeper still. “It may happen that it is not a matrix that lies at the core of both Wigner’s universality and the zeta function, but some other, yet undiscovered, mathematical structure,” Erdös said. “Wigner matrices and zeta functions may then just be different representations of this structure.”\n\nMany mathematicians are searching for the answer, with no guarantee that there is one. “Nobody imagined that the buses in Cuernavaca would turn out to be an example of this. Nobody imagined that the zeroes of the zeta function would be another example,” Dyson said. “The beauty of science is it’s completely unpredictable, and so everything useful comes out of surprises.”\n\nThis article was reprinted on Wired.com.",

    "fullText": "Finland has issued stricter guidelines for children’s use of digital gadgets, including the call for a ban on the use of social media or smartphones for under-13s. The new rules, drawn up by the Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and the National Agency for Education, were published on Thursday.\n\nThe agencies recommend that children under the age of 13 should not have smartphones of their own or be allowed to use social media. The recommendations cover youngsters’ free time, not homework or other school-related tasks.\n\nFor younger kids, no screen time at all is recommended for children aged under the age of two, with a maximum of one hour of screen time daily for those aged 2–10, rising to two hours for kids aged 11–13.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, age limits for games, TV shows, videos and films must be followed to avoid exposure to harmful content.\n\nThe recommendations are stricter than a draft version published last autumn, which only referred to banning social media. That attracted an exceptionally large number of comments from parents – more than 6,000 of them – most of whom supported the restrictions. Researchers and experts also urged stricter recommendations.\n\nThe THL plans to develop recommendations for 14–18-year-olds later this year.\n\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo (NCP) has also called for a ban on social media for children under the age of 15. His office is preparing a preliminary report on the matter.\n\nAccording to Yle sources, the government aims to proceed with the matter as quickly as possible. The legislative term ends in the spring of 2027.\n\nIt's about time, says Silja Kosola, an associate professor in adolescent medicine who has researched the impact of social media.\n\n\"We’ve had an uncontrolled human experiment going on. Finland has been a digitally savvy nation, and we have given phones to exceptionally young children. I’m not aware of any other country where first graders have had their own smartphones,\" Kosola told Yle.\n\nAccording to Kosola, the responsibility for restricting social media should not be left solely to parents. She warns of the Danish model, which aims to ban social media for those under 15, but allows 13-year-olds to use it with parental permission.\n\n\"That actually means the age limit is lower, and the whole idea is watered down. It’s really important that the same age limit really applies to everyone,\" Kosola said.",

Chair Andrea Lucas and recently-installed Commissioner Brittany Panuccio cited Trump’s executive order issued last year — in which he decreed there are two immutable sexes, male and female — as one of the reasons for revoking the document.\n\nLucas emphasized at the beginning of Thursday’s meeting that the commission’s decision to rescind the guidance “will not leave a void where employers are free to harass wherever they see fit, leaving a trail of victims in their wake,” citing several recent examples of settled harassment cases. And Panuccio said that private sector resources on anti-harassment law would fill in any gaps.\n\nBut critics argue that all workers will now be more vulnerable to harassment without the EEOC guidance. Kalpana Kotagal, the lone Democrat on the commission, likened it to “throwing out the baby with the bathwater.” She voted against getting rid of it.\n\n“At the height of the #MeToo movement, millions bravely came forward to share their stories, exposing harassment as an abuse of power,” Kotagal said. “The EEOC rose to the occasion by promulgating the guidance being rescinded today, which strives to make workplaces safer for everyone.”\n\nThe EEOC received more than 35,000 harassment complaints in fiscal year 2024.\n\nThe agency updated its guidance on workplace harassment in April 2024 under President Joe Biden for the first time in 25 years following a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination. Lucas voted against the guidance at that time, citing her opposition to language warning employers against deliberately misgendering transgender employees or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity.\n\n“It is neither harassment nor discrimination for a business to draw distinctions between the sexes in providing single-sex bathrooms or other similar facilities which implicate these significant privacy and safety interests,” Lucas wrote in a 2024 statement dissenting to the guidance.\n\nThe agency under Lucas’s leadership has been aggressively paring back protections for transgender workers, dropping lawsuits on their behalf as well as requiring heightened scrutiny for incoming complaints related to gender identity.\n\nWorkers’ groups have voiced strong opposition to removing the EEOC’s harassment guidance. Led by the National Women’s Law Center, more than 80 organizations signed a letter urging Lucas to preserve it.\n\nA few dozen protesters clustered outside the EEOC building on Thursday morning before the meeting, holding signs demanding “hands off the EEOC” and waving flags bearing the blue-and-yellow equality logo for LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign.\n\n“The fact that they’re taking this majorly in-depth guidance that is so worker-centered and they’re just chucking it all is such a slap in the face,” said Kate Miceli, a protester who previously worked at the Women’s Bureau at the Department of Labor.\n\nA group of 12 former EEOC and Department of Labor officials said withdrawing the whole document deprives “employers of a clear blueprint for creating and maintaining a harassment-free workplace and complying with anti-discrimination laws.” The group, called EEO Leaders, in a Jan. 20 statement also criticized the chair for depriving the public of the chance to weigh in on the decision by foregoing a notice and comment period.\n\nThe agency received more than 38,000 comments and public opinions during the yearslong process of developing the 2024 guidance. ________\n\nThe Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

    "description": "Record-breaking experiment shows that a cluster of thousands of atoms can act like a wave as well as a particle.",
    "fullText": "Schrödinger’s cat just got a little bit fatter. Physicists have created the largest ever ‘superposition’ — a quantum state in which an object exists in a haze of possible locations at once.\n\nA team based at the University of Vienna put individual clusters of around 7,000 atoms of sodium metal some 8 nanometres wide into a superposition of different locations, each spaced 133 nanometres apart. Rather than shoot through the experimental set up like a billiard ball, each chunky cluster behaved like a wave, spreading out into a superposition of spatially distinct paths and then interfering to form a pattern researchers could detect.\n\n“It’s a fantastic result,” says Sandra Eibenberger-Arias, a physicist at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin.\n\nQuantum theory doesn’t put a limit on how big a superposition can be, but everyday objects clearly do not behave in a quantum way, she explains. This experiment — which puts an object as massive as a protein or small virus particle into a superposition — is helping to answer the “big, almost philosophical question of ‘is there a transition between the quantum and classical?’,” she says. The authors “show that, at least for clusters of this size, quantum mechanics is still valid”.\n\nThe experiment, described in Nature on 21 January1, is of practical importance, too, says Giulia Rubino, a quantum physicist at the University of Bristol, UK. Quantum computers will ultimately need to maintain perhaps millions of objects in a large quantum state to perform useful calculations. If nature were to make systems collapse past a certain point, and that scale was smaller than what is needed to make a quantum computer, “then that’s problematic”, she says.\n\nPhysicists have long debated how the classical, everyday world emerges from an underlying quantum one. Quantum theory “never states it stops working above a certain mass or size”, says Sebastian Pedalino, a physicist at the University of Vienna and a co-author of the study.\n\nIn 1935, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger showed the absurdity of common interpretations of quantum mechanics with his famous cat-based thought experiment. The cat is put into a box with vial of poison, which will be released if a radioactive atom decays. If the box remains isolated from its environment, the atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and not-decayed, and until observed, the cat is an undefined state of both dead and alive.\n\nIn the real world, objects eventually become too complex or interact too much to maintain a superposition, an idea known as decoherence. But there are also extensions to quantum mechanics, known as collapse theories, that suggest that beyond a certain point, a system will inevitably reduce to a classical state, even in isolation. These theories were picked by 4% of researchers as their favourite interpretation of quantum mechanics in a 2025 Nature survey. “The only way to answer this question is by scaling up” quantum experiments, says Rubino.\n\nTo do this, Pedalino and his team generated a beam of clusters at 77 degrees kelvin (−196 ºC) in an ultra-high vacuum. The researchers put the beam through an interferometer consisting of three gratings constructed with laser beams. The first channelled the clusters through narrow gaps, from which they spread out and travelled in sync as waves; they then passed through a second set of slits that made the waves interfere in a distinctive pattern, which could be detected using the final grating.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00177-9\n\nRead the related News & Views: Quantum effect observed for biggest objects yet\n\nPedalino, S. et al.

    "fullText": "Lululemon is telling customers who buy their see-through leggings to cover up.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Thursday, Lululemon said that it had temporarily paused online sales of its \"Get Low\" collection in North America last week to \"review early guest feedback and insights.\"\n\nIt then updated its product information to incorporate new guidance on fit, sizing, and features, and the collection is now back online, the statement said.\n\nIn the fit and sizing section of the product listing, the athleisure company recommends pairing the leggings with \"skin-tone, seamless underwear,\" per checks of the website by Business Insider.\n\nIt also advises customers to size up the leggings to \"experience this tight's best performance during your workout.\"\n\nSeveral customer reviews on the \"Get Low\" tights listing talk about how they are not squat-proof and are see-through in the glute area. They retail for $108, are high-rise, and free of the front seam problem that's plagued Lululemon in the past.\n\nLululemon's statement comes after its founder, Chip Wilson, slammed the company's board for the \"Get Low\" tights on Wednesday, calling it a \"total operational failure.\"\n\n\"It is clear that persistent failures like this are born out of this Board's lack of experience in creative businesses, disinterest in product development and quality, and focus on short-term, self-interested priorities,\" Wilson said in a LinkedIn post.\n\nWilson left the company's board in 2015 and has since criticized the leadership on multiple occasions.\n\nLululemon has faced backlash in the past for selling see-through tights.\n\nIn 2013, Lululemon pulled back 17% of all its pants for being too sheer, and blamed the manufacturing error on an incomplete testing protocol.\n\nLululemon's stock price reacted favorably to the collection going back online. It rose about 2.5% on Thursday. However, it's down almost 50% in the past year.",

Two of the people said the company is expected to eliminate a similar number of roles in the coming round, bringing total job cuts to almost 30,000.\n\nThe latest cuts underscore Amazon's continued efforts to streamline operations and reset its culture.\n\nAmazon first attributed the October job cuts to changes brought on by AI. But CEO Andy Jassy later said the layoffs were instead tied to cultural fit, not cost savings or AI.\n\nAmazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce makes up a relatively small share, at about 350,000.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "OpenAI has pulled in a billion-dollar month from something other than ChatGPT.\n\nSam Altman said in a post on X on Thursday that OpenAI added more than $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the past month \"just from our API business.\"\n\n\"People think of us mostly as ChatGPT, but the API team is doing amazing work!\" the OpenAI CEO wrote.\n\nOpenAI's API enables other companies and developers to embed its models into their own products, from internal productivity software to coding tools.\n\nMany of Silicon Valley's high-profile startups rely on OpenAI's models as core infrastructure. Perplexity uses OpenAI's models to power parts of its AI search and answer engine. Harvey, one of the fastest-growing legal tech startups, is built on OpenAI's models to assist lawyers with research and drafting.\n\nAltman's comments underscore how OpenAI's infrastructure business is emerging as a key growth engine, even as the company faces massive costs for computing power and data centers.\n\nThose pressures have pushed OpenAI to look beyond consumer subscriptions.\n\nLast week, the company said it is gearing up to test ads inside ChatGPT as it faces about $1.4 trillion in spending commitments over the coming years.\n\nIt's a notable shift for a company that once treated ads as taboo. Less than two years ago, Altman said advertising was a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nSince then, Altman has struck a more open tone. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't \"totally against\" ads, though he stressed it would need to be approached carefully.\n\nEarlier this week, OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised the idea of \"licensing models\" that would let the company share in downstream sales if a customer's product succeeds.\n\n\"Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales,\" Friar said in an episode of \"The OpenAI Podcast\" published Monday.",

    "description": "Goldie Hawn, who has been married twice before, said she's learned that traditional ideas of partnership don't work for her.",
    "fullText": "Goldie Hawn, 80, says there's one reason her relationship with Kurt Russell has lasted more than four decades without marriage.\n\n\"Freedom. And I really feel this way, and I always have. And even if we did get married, it wouldn't make any difference because it's 42 years now,\" Hawn told host Dan Buettner on Thursday's episode of \"The Dan Buettner Podcast.\"\n\nHawn likened the experience to being a bird in a cage.\n\n\"If I'm a bird and you leave the cage door open, I may never fly out. But if you close that door, for my freedom and my independence, I would probably take, like, all my feathers off,\" Hawn said. \"It's a freedom of self, it's a freedom of basically, not melding into somebody else.\"\n\nHawn and her partner, Russell, met for the first time in 1966 and reconnected in 1983 after being cast in the romance drama \"Swing Shift.\" They started dating shortly after, and welcomed one son, Wyatt Russell, together in 1986.\n\nTheir blended family includes Russell's son, Boston, from his marriage to Season Hubley, and Hawn's children, Oliver and Kate Hudson, from her previous relationship with Bill Hudson.\n\nHawn, who has been married twice before, said she's learned that traditional ideas of partnership don't work for her.\n\n\"But, man, this whole idea of becoming one is not my idea of fun. That's why it works,\" she said.\n\nHawn said she and Russell share a strong bond, and accept that there will be parts of each other they don't love. But she doesn't see those imperfections as a good enough reason to walk away from the relationship.\n\n\"Why is that a reason to break up? Why is that a reason to say this isn't working?\" Hawn said.\n\n\"You might not like it, but is that a reason to suddenly decide that this isn't working for me?\" she continued.\n\nWhen Buettner asked why she keeps choosing Russell, Hawn listed several reasons.\n\n\"Because I have respect for him. Because I think he's an amazing person. I'm also very sexually attracted to him, and that's important,\" Hawn said, adding that he's smart and makes her laugh.\n\nShe also praised his talent and appearance.\n\n\"He's such a great actor, and I find him incredibly handsome to this day,\" she said.\n\nHawn added that they're \"an unbelievably happy family most of the time,\" despite their own individual flaws.\n\n\"Why would I want anybody who is perfect? There is no such thing,\" she said.\n\nHawn has long spoken about what she believes makes her relationship with Russell last. In 2024, she told E! News that \"good sex\" is a key part of it.\n\n\"Because sex is something that connects you and creates more belonging. People who have healthy sexual relationships usually last a lot longer. But it's not just because of the act, it's because of the warmth and the intimacy that it creates,\" she said.\n\nRussell has also shared his perspective on their decision not to marry.\n\n\"At that time, we constantly got asked, 'When are you going to get married? Why aren't you married?' And we were like, 'Why does anybody care about that?' We'd asked our kids if they cared about it. They didn't. We didn't,\" Russell told Variety in a 2023 interview.\n\nOther celebrities have also shared their own tips for making relationships last.\n\nIn 2024, Bette Midler told Entertainment Tonight that sleeping in separate bedrooms is the reason her marriage has lasted over 40 years.\n\n\"My husband snores,\" Midler said.\n\nIn 2025, Food Network star Ina Garten said her almost 60-year marriage works because they make decisions together.\n\n\"And this is what Jeffrey taught me: Let's figure out how we can both do what we want to do. It's not about whether we get to do what you want to do or I want to do,\" Garten said, referring to her husband, Jeffrey Garten.",

    "fullText": "TikTok's US workers can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe company announced Thursday that it has closed a deal to spin off parts of its US business in a new joint venture with an investor group.\n\n\"The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US,\" the company said.\n\nAdam Presser is leading the new venture, according to the company's announcement. Presser has worked at TikTok for nearly four years, most recently leading operations and trust and safety. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe agreement should keep the US government off its back as TikTok's parent, ByteDance, now owns just under 20% of the new US venture. That ownership stake meets a divestment requirement set by a 2024 US sell-or-ban law targeting TikTok and other apps with owners based in countries like China, which the US has deemed a foreign adversary.\n\nTikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer.\n\nWhile Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance.\n\nThe company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported.\n\nFollowing the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok.\"\n\nHe said the deal had reached a \"very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.\"\n\nThe deal has been in the works for a year. At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban.\n\nSince then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app. He also floated giving China a tariff reduction if it cut a deal on TikTok.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia is building roughly 500 Iranian-designed drones a day.\n\nHis comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, are a rare public assessment from Ukrainian leaders about Russia's drone-making capacity and provide some insight into how Kyiv sees the balance of power in its long-range drone fight.\n\nZelenskyy has said repeatedly that Ukraine is building 1,000 interceptor drones — small quadcopters designed to counter other flying drones — every day.\n\n\"We produce them at about 1,000 a day. We really produce them, but it's not enough. It's still not enough,\" he told his audience in Davos. \"Russia has 500, about 500 drones, Iranian drones, each day, and dozens of missiles, ballistic missiles.\"\n\nIranian drones refer to Russia's Geran family of loitering munitions, which are mostly based on the Iranian Shahed, a delta-wing drone designed to carry explosive warheads at long range. Because their designs are so closely related, Ukrainians often use their names interchangeably.\n\nThese drones have been a major pain point for Ukraine, which is frequently bombarded by hundreds of Gerans and decoy drones at a time from across Russia's border.\n\nLast week, Ukraine's commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russia is likely aiming to scale up its drone-making capacity to 1,000 Gerans per day.\n\nHe added that Russia is already building 404 Shaheds of \"various types\" per day.\n\nZelenskyy's latest comment also provides clues about the battlefield conditions for Ukraine's new type of air defense with interceptor drones.\n\nThe Ukrainian president's figures imply that his country is fielding twice as many interceptors as Russia's Shaheds, but that a 2:1 ratio isn't sufficient to protect his country's skies.\n\nFor now, interceptor drones in Ukraine are mostly controlled by human pilots, who have the difficult task of maneuvering lightweight quadcopters — sometimes in strong winds or poor weather — to chase down a flying target at speeds of over 100 mph in the vast sky.\n\nEarlier this week, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine also risks running short of interceptor drone pilots and told his government to prioritize recruiting and training more of them.\n\nThe Kremlin has been increasingly developing versions of Gerans with new features, such as jet engines to replace propellers or additional cameras to help the drone avoid interceptors.\n\nMore recently, Ukraine said Russia has deployed a new type of turbojet Geran that mirrors Iran's Karrar attack drone. Unlike the Shahed, it features a more conventional aircraft design,",

I'm much more visionary and a scientist.\"\n\nHe said his \"mission in life\" was not leadership, but to accelerate technological progress and inspire others to work on what interests them.\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company.\n\nHis new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models — a type of AI that closely reflects the real world. The Paris-based startup will work on open source solutions and be among the few frontier AI labs that he said are \"neither Chinese nor American.\"\n\nLeCun said that he would take on the role of executive chairman, while Alex LeBrun, his former colleague from Meta AI, will be the company's CEO. LeCun will continue teaching at NYU.\n\nIn the MIT interview, the AI pioneer said that he did not agree with all the choices Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made, such as letting go the robotics team inside FAIR.\n\nEarlier this month, he criticized the leadership of another Meta exec, Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data labelling startup Scale AI. Meta invested $14.3 billion in the buzzy startup, which included hiring Wang to lead AI progress.\n\n\"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher,\" LeCun said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nLeCun said that even though the 28-year-old was briefly his boss after Zuckerberg's AI reorg, he wasn't taking orders from Wang.\n\n\"You don't tell a researcher what to do,\" LeCun said. \"You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.\"\n\nHe also made similar remarks about being a visionary instead of a leader in the FT interview.\n\n\"I'm pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can't be a CEO,\" LeCun, 65, said. \"I'm both too disorganized for this, and also too old.\"",

    "description": "Here’s a roundup of research and predictions for tech workers amid the AI revolution.",
    "fullText": "The tech job market in 2026 is being built on contradictions.\n\nCompanies are laying off staff, insisting artificial intelligence will “do more with less” — yet they haven’t found ways to deploy AI at scale. Recruiters say entry-level pathways are narrowing, but critical roles remain hard to fill.\n\nEven as headlines scream “automation,” the day-to-day reality is messier: Hybrid work is still a dealbreaker, job titles are splintering into new specialties, and workers are being asked to produce more output with fewer resources.\n\nRest of World reviewed recent research on tech job trends in 2026\n\nDeloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study noted that while 30% of surveyed organizations are exploring agentic options and 38% are piloting solutions, only 14% have solutions that are ready to be deployed. A mere 11% are actively using these systems in production. Furthermore, 42% of organizations report they are still developing their agentic strategy road map, with 35% having no formal strategy at all.\n\nWhile most human workers are generally comfortable with predictable, rule-based robots, physical AI systems that learn and adapt introduce new uncertainties, especially worries about job displacement. Experts predict, however, that most roles will evolve toward collaboration rather than replacement.\n\nThe goal is to create environments where robots handle repetitive or dangerous tasks while humans focus on creative problem-solving and complex decision-making.\n\nThe best workers want hybrid or remote roles. Yet more companies are demanding full-time in-office attendance. It’s not making hiring any easier.\n\nThe battle lines have been drawn. Companies are demanding people return to the office full-time while workers dig in their heels, insisting they want remote or hybrid work options.\n\nCompanies are demanding people return to office while workers dig in their heels”\n\nAccording to the Korn Ferry report, 52% of talent acquisition leaders say office mandates hinder recruitment, while 72% find remote roles easier to fill.\n\nBusiness leaders might think this is fine right now, but in roles with chronic skills shortages, it’ll rapidly be clear that it’s not fine at all.\n\nIf your employer brand isn’t strong enough to overcome the office requirement, you’ll end up paying premium salaries to attract people who would otherwise work elsewhere. Or worse, you’ll just be filling seats — settling for whoever is willing to show up, not the talent who will move your business forward.\n\nTech recruitment platform Built In\n\nAs companies seek specialists, the emergence of new roles with novel job titles and nuanced skill requirements will be a feature of 2026. As the economy picks up steam, companies will narrow their focus and drift away from broad-spectrum roles with catch-all titles like “software engineer” and “data scientist” toward more tailored, task-specific job titles.\n\nNavigating the future of work in tech this year will involve companies focused more at the intersection of AI-workflow integration, governance, and impact.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move. This comes after Waymo announced another expansion of its robotaxi service in the US, hammering home its lead in the autonomous space — for now.\n\nMusk also claimed on Thursday that he expects the company’s self-driving service to get EU and China approval soon.\n\nTesla stock popped on the news, closing up over 4%.\n\nIn a post on X.com, Musk said Tesla \"started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\" This post came in response to users on X posting videos of the Tesla robotaxi operating without a safety driver.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Waymo, part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), said on its company blog that it is now operating in the Miami area, inviting its first public riders in the city. “With nearly 10,000 residents already signed up, we will be inviting new riders on a rolling basis to ensure a seamless experience across our initial 60-square-mile service area.”\n\nWaymo says plans for rides to Miami International Airport will be coming soon.\n\nBefore the Miami announcement, Waymo operated in five major US markets: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater San Francisco area.\n\nThis year, Waymo has an aggressive plan to expand, with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Nashville targeted for public service.\n\nIt also has plans for densely populated cities, with testing ongoing in New York, Tokyo, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's autonomous and robotaxis services are lagging. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk claimed the company’s full self-driving (FSD) autonomous service, a supervised product that requires users to pay attention while using it, would soon be coming to Europe and China.\n\n\"We hope to ​get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for China,\" Musk ‍said.\n\nWhile Waymo currently is only testing internationally in the cities mentioned above, its service is level 4 autonomous, which is fully autonomous in certain geographic areas. Tesla’s FSD is considered level 2.\n\nTesla’s robotaxis, currently operating in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, have grown in numbers but only modestly. The robotaxis still require a safety driver in each vehicle, owing to the fact that it is still a supervised service. The new video shared by Musk suggests the company has approval to operate without a safety driver in Austin, but the CEO didn't share whether that was the case.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "description": "It's been with us for a while.",
    "fullText": "The first known outbreak of syphilis in Europe began at the turn of the 16th century, but on the distant continent of South America, the pathogen's history goes much deeper than that.\n\nA 5,500-year-old skeleton discovered at an archaeological site in Colombia has now offered up DNA from the spiral-shaped bacterium Treponema pallidum.\n\nThis strain, called TE1-3, is not in circulation today, but based on its genome, it belongs to a very old branch, or an \"early-diverging sister lineage\" of T. pallidum.\n\nIt seems to have split off before other subspecies responsible for diseases like syphilis, yaws, bejel, and pinta emerged and spread around the world.\n\nThe discovery, led by evolutionary genomics researcher Davide Bozzi, pushes back the evidence for treponemal diseases, as they're known, by roughly 3,000 years.\n\nIt also points to an origin for syphilis in the Americas rather than in Europe, adding to growing genetic evidence elsewhere in South and Central America.\n\nIn Europe, the first outbreaks of syphilis occurred just after the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus returned from his journey to the Americas, and as a result, the two events have been historically tied together – a knot firmly tightened by racist and xenophobic ideologies about the way diseases spread.\n\nToday, genomic researchers are picking apart these deep and twisted roots using ancient DNA. Growing evidence from ancient bones suggests that syphilis-like diseases were present in the Americas long before their likeness emerged in Europe.\n\nIt's unknown whether TE1-3 was spread from human to human via sexual activity, as is the case with syphilis, or by skin-to-skin contact, as is the case with yaws, bejel, and pinta. But based on its genome, this ancient strain possessed virulence genes found in modern versions, which suggests it was harmful – or at least had already adapted to infect human hosts.\n\nBased on their results, Bozzi and colleagues estimate that the divergence between TE1-3 and other T. pallidum lineages occurred roughly 13,700 years ago – well before agricultural expansion in the Americas.\n\nThe findings suggest that contagious diseases were emerging among hunter-gatherer communities before the rise of dense farming populations living close to domesticated animals.\n\n\"Our findings show how even a single ancient pathogen genome can shift current understanding of pathogen emergence,\" the researchers write in their published paper.\n\nBut just because the oldest known evidence for a syphilis-like disease was found in South America doesn't mean it was solely confined to this one continent.\n\nWhile controversial, a subset of scientists working in Europe maintains that treponemal diseases and strains closely related to syphilis were present in Europe centuries before Columbus set sail for the Americas, suggesting that T. pallidum was present on both continents before Columbus's journey connected the two.\n\nBesides, there's even a chance that the expression of syphilis and other treponemal diseases is environmentally and socially determined. In other words, the bacterium may have been present in various populations but began to spread in different ways, and cause variations of the same disease, depending on environmental conditions.\n\nThis means the pathogen behind syphilis may not have been a sexually transmitted infection in pre-Columbian populations in the Americas; it may have later acquired this mode of transmission – and the stigma associated with it – in 15th-century Europe.\n\nWithout more evidence, all of these hypotheses remain possible.\n\nIn a related perspective, anthropologists Molly Zuckerman of Mississippi State University and Lydia Bailey of the US National Museum of Natural History, who were not involved in the recent research, argue that these findings \"make it possible to move beyond simplistic ideas of where diseases geographically come from.\"\n\n\"Framing Treponema origins through geographic binaries, such as 'Old World' versus 'New World,' obscures the ecological realities,\" they continue.\n\n\"Far from static or specific to a human population or environment, pathogens are tethered to mobile human and animal hosts and reservoirs, molded by human experiences and biosocial and environmental conditions, adaptable, and globalized.\"\n\nThe study was published in Science.\n\nScientists Tried to Spread The Flu, Only to Discover Something Unexpected\n\nNot All Sitting Is Equal. One Type Was Just Linked to Better Brain Health.\n\nShingles Vaccine Linked to Slower Biological Aging, Study Finds",

The acquisition was first announced in September 2024.\n\nAt the time, Verizon said in a press release that it aims to accelerate the delivery of its “mobility and broadband services to current and new customers” by purchasing Frontier.\n\nNow that the deal is finalized, Verizon says that its network footprint now reaches 31 states and Washington, D.C., offering “better value and more choices” to millions more customers, according to a new memo from Verizon CEO Dan Schulman.\n\n“Frontier has executed an impressive turnaround, consistently delivering strong results, and the momentum is clear,” said Schulman in the memo. “Our combined strength immediately creates an unparalleled fiber network.”\n\nFrontier has indeed rapidly grown its internet customer base in recent months, following its exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021. During the third quarter of 2025, Frontier added 133,000 new fiber internet customers, reflecting a 20.2% year-over-year increase, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nThe company’s fiber broadband revenue growth also spiked by 25%, compared to the same time period in 2024.\n\nVerizon hopes that this deal will not only help its Fios internet service reach more consumers but also repair its recent wireless customer losses.\n\nIn the third quarter of last year, after implementing price hikes and ending several discounts, Verizon lost 7,000 postpaid phone customers, pushing its churn rate to 0.91%.\n\nThe loss comes at a time when more consumers nationwide are considering switching phone carriers as they battle higher monthly bills, according to a survey from Market Force Information last year.\n\nApproximately 65% of consumers use phone services from the \"Big 3\" carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T, spending over $100 per month on their wireless services.\n\nOn average, Verizon customers pay over $150 for service.\n\nAbout 23% of Verizon customers are considering switching to another carrier in the next year or two, citing better pricing, promotions and coverage as the primary reasons.\n\nVerizon scored 40% in overall brand performance across customer experience metrics.\n\nSmaller wireless carriers such as Consumer Cellular and Mint Mobile scored 73% and 65.8%, respectively.\n\n\"There's a clear shift in the market towards smaller, more agile wireless carriers who are delivering superior customer experiences,\" said David Murray, senior director of client strategy at Market Force Information, in a press release.\n\n\"While cost and coverage are always key factors, today's consumers are placing more importance on ease of service and overall satisfaction with their provider,” he continued.\n\nVerizon hopes that combining its mobile offers with Frontier’s internet service will increase customer loyalty and improve its postpaid phone churn rate by approximately 50%.\n\nVerizon had to jump through hurdles to complete its acquisition of Frontier. In May last year, the wireless carrier cut its diversity, equity and inclusion policies to gain approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the acquisition.\n\nAlso, last week, to secure approval from California state regulators for the acquisition (the final step in finalizing the deal), Verizon vowed to invest in 75,000 new fiber locations and build 25 new wireless towers to expand service in rural areas of the state, according to a recent report from Reuters.\n\nT-Mobile announces free offer for Verizon and AT&T customers\n\n​​Verizon CEO sounds alarm on why customers are leaving in droves\n\nSpectrum raises red flag on cause of fleeing customer problem\n\nVerizon also agreed to provide free internet service to many low‑income households in California for at least 10 years.\n\nIn response to the finalized Verizon and Frontier deal, analysts at S&P Global stated that the acquisition will give cable companies tougher competition.\n\nCable giants, such as Spectrum and Xfinity, have recently been ramping up deals on bundled phone, internet and TV services to attract more customers, posing a major threat to wireless carriers nationwide.\n\n“The transaction, which we view as integral to Verizon’s current identity and future strategy, will enable Verizon to bundle in home broadband and mobile services to a wider footprint to better compete with incumbent cable providers,” said S&P Global analysts William Savage and Allyn Arden in a recent report.",

    "title": "This Tire Brand Has The Lowest Customer Satisfaction Rating, According To Consumer Reports",
    "description": "Checking reviews for specific brands can help you avoid a headache when buying tires for your car, and this brand has particularly low satisfaction scores.",
    "fullText": "Purchasing new tires for your car, truck, or SUV is rarely a satisfying event. One might even argue that it is one of the more frustrating undertakings a vehicle owner will endure, as purchasing tires from even one of the more trusted manufacturers in the game doesn't guarantee you're going to get the results you want. And yes, on top of that inherent risk, you'll likely be expected to pay an arm and a leg for a set of four new tires to boot.\n\nThere are, of course, a few helpful tips and tricks you can follow to lessen the frustration of purchasing new tires. But you should also consult consumer ratings factions like Consumer Reports, which not only undertakes regular tests and rankings of various tire brands and models, but also conducts surveys with real customers about each. In the latter case, CR recently sought to rank several major tire brands via one of the more potentially damning market metrics — customer satisfaction.\n\nPer Consumer Reports, the aspects of new tires prized most by shoppers are their ability to grip the road in inclement weather, overall smoothness and handling, and the lifespan of their tread. If you're in the market for a satisfying All-Season tire, Uniroyal appears to be the brand that you need to avoid the most, as it's rated dead last in terms of satisfaction. To that end, you should also avoid All-Season tires from Sumitomo, Kelly, Dunlop, and a few other budget brands.\n\nYes, Uniroyal was rated at the bottom of Consumer Reports' recent ranking of the most satisfying All-Season tire brands, though several other budget offerings were also listed in the red for the same category. Unfortunately for the Michelin-owned tire maker, it also landed last in customer satisfaction when it comes to its Winter/Snow tire offerings. Sumitomo, Kelly, Hercules, GT Radial, Dunlop, and, surprisingly, BF Goodrich were also rated red by unsatisfied customers in that category.\n\nIn the Summer tire category, Sumitomo was the worst rated tires for customer satisfaction, with the budget brand making the unfortunate claim of being at, or very near the bottom of the list in all four categories surveyed for the Consumer Reports rankings. The last of those lists is the All-Terrain category, which also saw Sumitomo earn the lowest marks for customer satisfaction. On aggregate, that would seem to make the budget Japanese brand the least-loved of those surveyed for the CR report, signaling that any satisfaction you might feel regarding the price of Sumitomo tires at the point of purchase may erode with a quickness once you're on the road.\n\nIf you're curious about which brand fared best on the Consumer Reports satisfaction list, Michelin Tires earned the highest rating of light green in all four categories surveyed. It was the only manufacturer to claim that honor. However, the European tire brand Vredestein was also rated well in all categories, earning light green marks in the All-Season, Winter/Snow, and Summer tire categories, and a dark green rating in the All-Terrain sector.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

I'm Cuban, and my best friend is a Black man. We drove down to visit my family and go to Disney World in the summer of 2024, and we were legit scared to stop for lunch or bathroom breaks. And when we did, we were SO careful, because we were genuinely terrified of being harassed, shot, or both.\"\n\n\"Second, the culture and the arts. It is impossible to match the museums and high arts of large cities in blue states, but there are good orchestras and regional arts to enjoy everywhere.

It's completely secular; there are no religious requirements, and no judgment. Coming from one of those 'poor-people-don’t-deserve-cookies' places, it’s an absolute breath of fresh air. Books, too.

    "description": "Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider won the 2026 PFWA Executive Of The Year award today.",
    "fullText": "Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider won the PFWA Executive Of The Year award today.\n\nThe Professional Football Writers of America put out a press release Thursday announcing their on field awards, in which Schneider was named as the winner. He’s the first Seahawk to win the award since it was created in 1993. He’s been a strong candidate in many of his 17 years in charge, with the team having three different eras of success within the timespan- each of which he rebuilt and retooled the roster to major success through all available avenues.\n\nThis doesn’t come as a shock to the Seattle media sphere because of that. Almost every voice covering the Seahawks has called for this to be the year he finally wins. Having the confidence to move off the past coach’s players despite their stardom and leadership allowed him to make the team new and exciting enough to go from good to great. Trading Geno Smith and D.K. Metcalf put him under scrutiny, under which he proved he deserved this year’s award. Ten months later, he’s won it, and has a chance to add a third NFC Championship and a second Super Bowl ring to his resume in the coming weeks.\n\nSchneider’s best trait isn’t just winning trades, though- he’s considered by many around football to be the best personnel guy there is. His draft record is outstanding, littered with Pro Bowlers, Hall of Famers, and other legends. Just this year, Grey Zabel at the 18th pick was exactly what the team needed, Nick Emmanwori at 35 has dictated how the entire NFC can play offense, Tory Horton looked like a steal in the 5th Round before getting hurt, and Robbie Ouzts has become a major contributor. In past years, he’s had some of the best rounds in draft history, selecting All-Pros Devon Witherspoon and Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the first round in 2023, and selecting future Hall of Famers Russell Wilson and Bobby Wagner just 28 picks apart in 2012.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks general manager John Schneider wins Executive Of The Year",

    "description": "The Capitals haven't been able to get much going consistently since Dec. 5, and now, they're trying to find a fix — and fast.",
    "fullText": "It's easy to sense the frustration among the Washington Capitals right now.\n\nAfter dropping their fourth straight game, this time a 4-3 decision to a Vancouver Canucks team that sits last in the standing and had lost 11 straight entering Wednesday's contest, the Capitals were again left looking for answers to issues that have been evident since the start of December.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we're just making too many big mistakes,\" coach Spencer Carbery said postgame after the loss to Vancouver. \"I sound like a broken record, but that's just the reality of it. We're making massive, massive mistakes. And it's throughout — you just can't in this league, it's just too competitive. You just cannot give free goals, and that's what we're doing too much.\"\n\nDiving into the exact struggles, the Capitals' main issues appear to stem at 5-on-5, with special teams seeing a recent boost and even providing D.C. with an early 2-0 lead against the Canucks.\n\nSince Dec. 5, Washington ranks 10th-worst in Corsi-for percentage at 5-on-5 (47.74 and has given up the third-most shots in the NHL over that span (562). Overall, at even strength, lapses in coverage have become an apparent issue, along with inconsistency through 60 minutes.\n\nIt doesn't go unnoticed, or ignored, in the Capitals' dressing room with the standings getting tighter. But as John Carlson pointed out, the team needs to translate those desired changes to the ice.\n\n\"We talk about it ad nauseam,\" John Carlson said of the team's woes. \"We address it, and there's no hiding in here. We know where our games at and what we need, what we expect from each other.\"\n\nHaving watched from up top over the previous eight games due to injury, Tom Wilson noted that Washington's struggles have nothing to do with a lack of trying, but instead, defensive breakdowns that need to be resolved before anything else.\n\n'It’s tough, you’re paying every other night. We gotta defend better, that has nothing to do with the legs or energy, we’re just giving them too many odd-man rushes, we’re giving them too many times where we lose coverage and the guy’s all alone on (our goaltender),\" Wilson said. \"I think we’re going to have to look ourselves in the mirror, defend a little bit better and then from there, we’ll worry about the offensive end once we get there.\"\n\nAs Wilson pointed out, improving from there will help the team's transition game, where Washington can then shift its focus to generating more chemistry and urgency on offense.\n\nNow that the lineup is back to full strength, there should be more consistency in the lines, which will translate to better results. But at the end of the day, it comes down to finishing and getting more on goal, one way or another.\n\n\"(There's) talking about it, and then you got to execute. I think that's the name of the game, is execution,\" Carlson explained. \"Whether it's making the right plays to get out of the zone or making the right plays in the o-zone to get a scoring chance, or when you do get a scoring chance, to bear down and score. I think we need to gather more of those key moments each game, and we got to learn pretty quick.\"\n\nThe Capitals had off Thursday as they traveled to Alberta, where they'll look to end their losing streak and get back on track in a back-to-back against the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers.",

    "description": "On the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback with Ian Begley, SNY's NBA Insider and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype discuss Karl-Anthony Towns trade rumors and potential deadline deals.",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NBA trade deadline arriving on Feb. 5, there are plenty of questions surrounding the Knicks and their NBA Finals expectations.\n\nNew York snapped their four-game losing streak in an impressive win over the Nets on Wednesday night, but the team is still in the midst of one of its worst stretches in the Jalen Brunson era. With the win, they are 3-9 over their last 12 games and have fallen into the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference -- they would be the four-seed if they didn't hold the tiebreaker over the Raptors.\n\nSo, as the Knicks look to improve the roster, what should fans be looking for? SNY NBA Insider Ian Begley spoke on the topic on the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback, where he and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype broke down what they are hearing as the trade deadline gets closer.\n\nAfter the Knicks' dreadful loss to the undermanned Mavericks at home on Monday, Newsday's Steve Popper reported that New York had spoken to a number of teams (Hornets, Grizzlies, Magic) about a potential trade involving Towns.\n\nTowns' numbers are down pretty much across the board and the big man even admitted that he's had a tough time adjusting to head coach Mike Brown's system.\n\nBegley shared on The Putback what he had heard.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations about trading Karl-Anthony Towns,\" Begley said. \"As of Monday, it was not happening. As far as something in the aftermath of that Dallas loss, no, that wasn’t the case.\"\n\nBegley added that if the Knicks go through another 2-9 stretch and continue to struggle as they get closer to the trade deadline, things might change.\n\nWhenever Towns' name is thrown out there as a trade candidate, the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is not far behind. It seems like an easy swap for both teams, but Scotto threw some cold water on the idea.\n\n“I personally never gotten the sense, at least from talking to my sources, that a team like the Milwaukee Bucks would be overly aggressive in trying to get Karl Towns in a Giannis Antetokounmpo package, theoretically,\" Scotto said.\n\nScotto suggested that the Knicks, if they were to deal Towns, would have to consider \"breaking up\" Towns' salary into multiple pieces, similar to what the Timberwolves did when they moved the big man to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations on trading Karl-Anthony Towns\"\n\nOn The Putback with @IanBegley, Ian discusses what he's heard on the KAT reports and his read on if the Knicks would make that trade pic.twitter.com/bvLAdFjzt2\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 22, 2026\n\nSince a Towns trade is unlikely, what players should we be on the lookout for?\n\nGuerschon Yabusele is as likely a candidate to be moved. According to Scotto, the acquisition was seen as a \"homerun\" by execs in the offseason, but it was made before the hiring of Brown. Clearly, Yabusele has had a tough time integrating into Brown's system, and the Knicks are looking to shop him. Scotto even suggested the Knicks may have to pair Yabusele with another minimum-salary player or draft picks to get a player that could help the team.\n\nScotto shared that the Pelicans have two players that the Knicks checked in.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were calling not only on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans but also Yves Missi,\" Scotto said. \"Part of it could be doing background, doing due diligence, but you don't make calls on these guys unless you're intersted so that raised my antenna a little bit. If you take Yabusele and another minimum guy, you could maybe try to make something happen there.\"\n\nThe Knicks' interest in Alvarado is well-documented by Missi is a name that even Begley was surprised by.\n\nMissi, 21, is a second-year center who has seen his minutes deep in year two. In his rookie campaign, Missi played around 27 minutes a game (73 games), averaging nine points, and eight rebounds (3.5 offensive). In his sophomore year, Missi is averaging 19 minutes and just 5.5 points and 5.5 rebounds (2.9 offensive) across 38 games.\n\nAcquiring another big like Missi could open up more avenues for deals involving the Knicks. Would they deal Mitchell Robinson, who is on the final year of his contract, or one of the depth bigs like Ariel Hukporti? That also opens up the possibility to trade Towns as well.\n\nThe Knicks have a lot to consider as they hope to fortify their roster for the final stretch of the regular season and the playoffs.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were not only calling on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans, but also Yves Missi\"\n\nOn today's episode of The Putback, @MikeAScotto - a must-follow for NBA fans - discusses trade deadline (link to full show in post below) pic.twitter.com/11wdozjICd\n\n— Ian Begley (@IanBegley) January 22, 2026",

The Knicks got back in the win column Wednesday with a 120-66 win against the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nBegley believes the Knicks may consider drastic trades if the team has another rough stretch before the Feb. 5 trade deadline.\n\n\"If you see another 2-9 stretch or something like that ahead of the trade deadline, I think that's when you have to consider that, 'Hey, we need to shake something up here,'\" he said.\n\nTowns is averaging 20.8 points, 11.5 rebounds and shooting 46.9% from the field this season. He is in his second season in New York after being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves before last season.\n\nTowns' max contract is fully guaranteed through the 2027-28 season, making him a difficult player to trade. But the Begley thinks Knicks are intent on keeping him for now.\n\n\"I don't think they're there yet,\" he said. \"They're not out there shopping Karl-Anthony Towns.\"\n\nThe Knicks (26-18) return to action Saturday night against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n76ers' Tyrese Maxey lands signature shoe deal\n\nLakers legend rumored to be involved in 'NBA Europe' project\n\nESPN NBA analyst gives Lakers' season mediocre grade\n\nMichael Jordan's 'NBA on NBC' appearance disappointing for fans\n\nDeMarcus Cousins makes bold claim about LeBron James' future\n\nHeat could keep promising young player for potential Giannis trade",

    "fullText": "GLENDALE – The heavy favorite for the Arizona Cardinals head coaching job seems to be Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph. His ties to the franchise makes him an easy choice to understand why he will be the guy. Despite those reports and betting odds, there is still plenty of candidates vying for the opportunity.\n\nAri Meirov, who covers the NFL for the 33rd team, talked with PHNX Cardinals about other names in the running for the Cardinals job. Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur was a name that Meirov spoke about extensive about the desire to be a head coach in the NFL.\n\nJun 3, 2025; Woodland Hills, CA, USA; Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur at press conference during organized team activities at Rams Practice Facility. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\n“I have a hard time seeing Mike LaFleur not taking a job. He does a lot of work in L.A., a lot of work. He doesn’t call the plays, that’s Sean [McVay’s] job. He’s very, very important there. He learnt a lot from that experience with the [New York] Jets. Which was a difficult situation. He goes back to his buddy in Sean McVay, and it’s a whole new life for him…If you get him now, it might be bumpy at the beginning but eventually these guys will figure it out.”\n\nSep 28, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Rams cornerback Cobie Durant (14) and offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur as they get ready for the game against the Indianapolis Colts at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nWhen the Arizona job first opened, BetOnline had LaFleur as the early favorite for the job. Since then, the lines have change, but his connection with the franchise remains strong. LaFleur is in a similar boat as Joseph, as both of their teams will be competing in a conference championship game on Sunday. One would wonder, if Denver loses on Sunday and Los Angles wins or vice versa, it opens the door for either candidate to get the Cardinals job.\n\nMeirov explained LaFleur’s desire to be a head coach, and with five of the 10 NFL jobs close, his opportunity is running out. The 38-year-old will have to worry about his fellow Rams coaches from taking other opportunities. DC Chris Shula is a strong candidate for the Pittsburgh Steelers job, while Los Angeles’ passing-game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase is the top choice for the Cleveland Browns.\n\nAug 14, 2025; Carson, CA, USA; Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur reacts during a joint practice at the Dignity Health Sports Park. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nThe Cardinals could swoop in and hire LaFleur to continue expanding McVay’s impressive coaching tree. Liam Coen, Zac Taylor and Kevin O’Connell are just three former coordinators of McVay to become successful head coaches in the NFL. In a tough NFC West, Arizona could try to replicate the magic that Los Angeles has done to revive the franchise.\n\nCardinals go offensive line in Mel Kiper’s 2026 NFL mock draft",

Duranville made his Bundesliga debut in May 2023 against 1. FSV Mainz 05 at the age of 17.\n\nHe subsequently played 15 Bundesliga matches, nine Champions League matches and one DFB-Pokal match against Phönix Lübeck, in which he scored his first competitive goal for Borussia Dortmund. During his time at BVB, Duranville also played two senior international matches for Belgium, for whom he made his debut in September 2024.\n\nBVB sporting director Sebastian Kehl says: “Julien has been with us in Dortmund for three years, but he is still a very young player in whom we continue to see great potential. However, due to injuries, among other things, he has not been able to show his talent and abilities to the extent we would have liked. The move to FC Basel now gives him the opportunity to gain regular playing time and develop further. We are convinced that this is the right step for his future prospects here at BVB.

    "fullText": "The Seattle Mariners signed an interesting - and familiar name - to a minor league deal on Thursday afternoon, coming to terms with former Texas Rangers pitcher Dane Dunning.\n\nThe 31-year-old Dunning was a first-round pick of the Washington Nationals in the 2016 MLB Draft out of the University of Florida. He was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez in 2017 for outfielder Adam Eaton and made his debut with Chicago in 2020. He made just seven appearance for Chicago before getting dealt to Texas for Lance Lynn in the offseason before the 2021 campaign.\n\nFree agent signing: Right-hander Dane Dunning has a minor league deal with the Mariners, per sources.\n\n— Chris Cotillo (@ChrisCotillo) January 22, 2026\n\nDunning went 5-10 for the rebuilding Rangers in 2021, pitching to a 4.51 ERA, and then he went 4-8 in 2022 with a 4.46 ERA in 2022.\n\nHe turned a corner in 2023, going 12-7 with a 3.70 ERA in 35 games (26 starts), helping the Rangers win the World Series over the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2024, he went just 5-7 with a 5.31 ERA and he made only 12 appearances in 2025 between the Rangers and Atlanta Braves, going 0-0 with a 6.97 ERA.\n\nThat's too Dane bad!\n\nStrikeout no. 1 for @Ddunning33! pic.twitter.com/tgNiNZeEzm\n\n— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) August 20, 2020\n\nThere's a few things that it could mean for Seattle, actually.\n\n1) The Mariners figure to have Logan Gilbert, Bryan Woo, Luis Castillo, Bryce Miller and George Kirby in the starting rotation as long as everyone is healthy. With a lot of experience, Dunning is a logical option in case someone is injured in spring training.\n\n2) The Mariners also have Emerson Hancock and Logan Evans to serve as the emergency starters in the system, but if the team decides to keep Hancock as a reliever in 2026, then Dunning likely bumps up a spot. Hancock's role will be important to watch as spring training develops.\n\n3) Perhaps Dunning could become a bullpen option for Seattle. He's made 34 relief appearances in his career.\n\nThe Mariners aren't sending any of their starting rotation to the World Baseball Classic but several top relievers are headed to their national teams, meaning there should be substantial chances for Dunning to get innings in camp, which begins Feb. 12.\n\n--The Mariners had four prospects in the Top 100 of the latest Baseball America rankings. Lazaro Montes was ranked as the No. 9 outfield prospect in the sport by MLB Pipeline.\n\n--Julio Rodriguez was named as the No. 16 player in the game on the MLB Network countdown. Cal Raleigh is in the Top 10, which is revealed on Thursday.\n\nRemember to join our MARINERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA player says dating Khloe Kardashian 'derailed' his career originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer NBA guard Rashad McCants says his brief relationship with Khloe Kardashian came at a cost he believes went far beyond tabloid attention. In his view, the timing and culture of the league during his playing days turned off-court visibility into a professional liability.\n\nMcCants, who was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2005, has said that players in his era were expected to keep a low profile unless they were established superstars. Any perceived distraction, he argues, could quickly be held against someone still trying to secure a foothold in the league.\n\nMORE: Miami fans think adult film star Abella Danger is dating Carson Beck because of a viral fake tweet\n\nSpeaking with Basketball Network’s Nick Raguz, McCants explained how celebrity relationships were viewed differently before the rise of social media and player branding. “Before, it was a distraction,” he said. “The powers didn’t want players doing anything outside of the NBA that would be considered a distraction. You didn’t see a lot of guys dating celebrities unless they were high-profile players.”\n\nAccording to McCants, that distinction mattered. Playing in a small market while dating someone already famous brought scrutiny he felt he couldn’t afford. “For me, not being a high-profile guy and being in Minnesota, it was more of a distraction than a compliment,” he said. “I was one of the early bloomers for all of those things, and it didn’t help my situation.”\n\nOn the court, McCants’ NBA run was short and uneven. Injuries and inconsistent minutes limited his opportunities, and he averaged 9.9 points per game across four seasons with the Timberwolves. As teams turned over rosters and leaned toward younger players, his role diminished, and his NBA career ended after the 2008-09 season.\n\nMORE: Klay Thompson shows up to support Megan Thee Stallion's latest Dunkin promo\n\nThe former guard also pointed to how much the league has changed since then. Today’s NBA encourages players to build brands, embrace social media, and expand their visibility, regardless of market size. In McCants’ telling, that shift highlights how different the environment was when he was trying to establish himself.",

Meanwhile, Piet Scobel’s brace helped Nürnberg to a dramatic 3-2 win over second-placed Elversberg.\n\nHowever, their last four head-to-head games have only resulted in a total of five goals. Darmstadt won the reverse fixture with the only goal of the game coming at the 94th minute from substitute Killian Corredor.\n\nFabian Nürnberger could be back straight into Darmstadt’s starting lineup against his former club Nürnberg.

    "fullText": "Brian Harman was cruising around the Pete Dye Stadium Course Thursday at The American Express when the round started to unravel. The major champion was two under standing in the middle of the par-4 10th fairway and hit an approach shot to inside 10 feet.\n\nThe 39-year-old lefty was that close to what he thought would move him to three under in California.\n\nBut he discovered that he did not hit the proper ball from the middle of the fairway. He hit the ball of his amateur playing partner which was only a few feet away. Add two strokes!\n\nSo Harman then hit his approach with his original ball from 122 yards to 14 feet and two putted for a dreaded double bogey. He thought he was staring at a 3, walked off with a 6.\n\nRule 6.3c(1) says, “the player gets the general penalty (two strokes) and must correct the mistake by continuing play with the original ball by playing it as it lies or taking relief under the rules.” The stroke made with the wrong ball and any more strokes before the mistake is corrected do not count.\n\nHarman was clearly bothered by the whole circumstance and it crept into the next hole, the par-5 11th where he made another double bogey after he hit his second shot into the water, dropped, failed to hit the green then did not get up and down. Ultimately he shot one-over 73 and well down near the bottom of the leaderboard.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS – Waldo Cortes-Acosta sees himself in prime position if he can get past Derrick Lewis.\n\nCortes-Acosta (16-2 MMA, 9-2 UFC) faces former title challenger Lewis (29-12 MMA, 20-10 UFC) in Saturday's UFC 324 (Paramount+) main card at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nCortes-Acosta, who fought five times in 2025, initially wanted to fight in December but wound up with a better deal in the promotion's debut card on Paramount.\n\n\"It's better, too, because it's my sixth fight in 11 months\" Cortes-Acosta told MMA Junkie and other reporters at Wednesday's UFC 324 media day. \"I didn't get a sixth fight in 2025, but I'm having a sixth fight in 11 months. This is amazing, too.\"\n\nThe Dominican fighter admits he grew up watching Lewis and is excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"I'm a person like, I'm training hard every time,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"For Derrick Lewis, when he started, I'd barely been training MMA. I followed him so much because he's a heavyweight, too, like me. He was one of my favorite fighters before until now, too, let me tell you. This Saturday, one day I was thinking, one day you will be fighting with him, and look at now. This is real, and next Saturday, Jan. 24, it will be happening. It's amazing for me.\"\n\nWith the heavyweight title picture currently unclear, that opportunity could lead to big things for Cortes-Acosta\n\n\"I want to fight at the White House,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"Latino America, everybody, we support it. More clout, so people can see one Latino fighting at the White House is amazing.\"\n\nUFC heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall is set to undergo double eye surgery after getting poked in the eye in his title fight against Ciryl Gane at UFC 321 this past October. No timeline for his return has been set, but Cortes-Acosta is ready to slide in if necessary.\n\n\"It's possible,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"I'd be available for the title shot or interim shot, interim title. Any fight the UFC can put on there, I'll be fighting, but I want to fight.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC 324: Waldo Cortes-Acosta wants White House title fight with win",

    "fullText": "There are just four NFL teams remaining in postseason play, with four former UNC football standouts scattered across those rosters. One Tar Heel in particular, though, is MVP contender Drake Maye.\n\nA quarterback who starred at North Carolina from 2021-2023, Maye is anchoring the New England Patriots' most successful season since Bill Belichick's head coaching days. Maye has his team in its first AFC Championship game since 2019, when New England won its most recent Super Bowl Title.\n\nOn Thursday, Maye earned some well-deserved recognition for his breakout campaign, earning one of the AP's five finalist nominations for NFL MVP.\n\nJoining Maye in this exclusive group are San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the last of whom is widely considered the MVP frontrunner.\n\nMaye has a golden chance to deliver his MVP-clinching moment on Sunday, with the Patriots traveling to face the Denver Broncos in a cold, 3 p.m. ET AFC Championship clash.\n\nOne step closer. 👟\n\nThe Real MVP. @DrakeMaye2 pic.twitter.com/AJSnZElrPm\n\n— Carolina Football (@UNCFootball) January 22, 2026\n\nBias aside, Maye makes an extremely strong case to win MVP in his \"Sophomore\" NFL season. Maye's 4,394 passing yards are fourth amongst quarterbacks in the regular season, his 31 passing touchdowns are third and his 77.1 QBR led the NFL.\n\nMaye also compiled 450 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns in regular season action, showcasing the same dual-threat ability he did as a Tar Heel.\n\nDespite five turnovers in the postseason, Maye is playing solid football in leading New England one win from the Super Bowl. Maye completed 33 of his first 56 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 76 rushing yards on 14 carries.\n\nIf Maye takes better care of the football on Sunday and his offensive line holds up, Maye will have no issue putting an exclamation point on his case for NFL MVP.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: Drake Maye tabbed a finalist for 2025 AP NFL MVP award",

The game, corresponding to the second round of the Liga BetPlay I-2026, cannot be played on the originally scheduled date because the event organizer did not meet the deadlines for delivering the Atanasio Girardot Stadium to INDER Medellín. This lack of administrative coordination has prevented the sports venue from being available for professional football according to the established calendar.\n\nThe governing body was emphatic in stating that this situation is completely beyond its control, regretting the serious impact on the tournament’s planning and the direct harm to the clubs involved. In order to mitigate the sporting impact, DIMAYOR has set April 6 as the new date for the match at the \"Coloso de la 74,\" with the final kickoff time yet to be confirmed.

    "description": "Get the best Lakers vs. Clippers predictions ahead of tonight's battle of L.A. at the Intuit Dome. Free NBA picks for January 22.",
    "fullText": "As we hit the halfway point in the NBA schedule, the Los Angeles Clippers finally seem to be salvaging their season, but that progress will be tested tonight when they host the Los Angeles Lakers at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Battle of L.A. season series sits at 1-1 heading into this matchup, and my Lakers vs. Clippers predictions expect LeBron James to be one of the swing factors.\n\nLet's dive right into my NBA picks for Thursday, January 22.\n\nLakers vs Clippers best bet: LeBron James Over 12.5 rebounds + assists (-112 bet365)\n\nLeBron James' injury issues may point to a 41-year-old in his 23rd season, but his stat lines suggest he’s got something left in the tank. James has been able to keep his sciatica and arthritis at bay while starting 2026 with a bang, so look for his fingerprints to be all over tonight’s clash with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nWith Luka Doncic doing so much of the scoring for the Los Angeles Lakers, I’m targeting LeBron’s rebounds and assists here, and he’s gone past this combo O/U number in four of his past five outings.\n\nJames has been getting the job done in both these categories so far this month, with averages of 7.7 RPG and 7.6 APG in January, and he was closing in on a triple-double in L.A.’s win over the Denver Nuggets earlier this week.\n\nUntil Austin Reaves returns, LeBron is going to have a larger share of the playmaking, particularly when Luka is on the bench, and there’s just not a lot of secondary ball-handling in the current rotation. Equally, he’s got a big role to play alongside Deandre Ayton on the boards.\n\nAt this stage of his career, James can still do the little things that drive winning, and the Lakers will need all of that veteran savvy to hold off their cross-city rivals tonight.\n\nThe Lakers are 7-3 SU in their last 10 meetings with the Clippers, and an impressive 14-8 on the road this season. With Kawhi Leonard still listed as questionable, the burden on James Harden could once again be massive, and the hosts gave up 138 points to the Chicago Bulls this week.\n\nHarden continues to put up big numbers, and I’ll take the Over on his rebounds prop here. He’s grabbed 4+ boards in six of his last seven games, and the Clippers will gladly keep him closer to the rim if it avoids the Luka defensive assignment.\n\nIvica Zubac has had some miserable possessions trying to guard Doncic on switches in the past, but the Clippers will lean on him for big minutes here. Zubac has posted three straight double-doubles, and he’s finished with 11+ rebounds in his last four games.\n\nSpread: Lakers -1.5 (+100) | Clippers +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Lakers -110 | Clippers -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 223.5 (-110) | Under 223.5 (-110)\n\nThe Lakers are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings between these teams.

    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers will enter the offseason with a new offensive coordinator after Zac Robinson was hired.\n\nThe former Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator joins the Bucs, and the wealth of weapons Baker Mayfield has at his disposal.\n\nBut Baker might have one less, depending on how the offseason goes.\n\nMike Evans is a free agent, and we aren't sure if No. 13 will continue on or retire.\n\nFor ESPN's Bill Barnwell, money will be a big factor in how this plays out.\n\n\"The player Evans' camp will try to link the star wideout to is Davante Adams, who hit free agency after a frustrating age-32 season and landed a two-year, $44 million contract with the Rams, including $26 million guaranteed at signing,\" Barnwell writes. \"Would the Bucs agree to that sort of deal?\n\n\"Evans is a franchise legend, though, and the rules can be different when those types of players are involved. It would surprising if he played somewhere else in 2026.\"\n\nMore:Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield gives NFL perfect Week 1 setup with Stefanski's Falcons\n\nIs it worth it for the Buccaneers to give Evans Davante Adams-type money?

The reliever had a 2.95 ERA through 76.1 innings pitched, and struck out a total of 74 batters during his time at the top level.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Co-Owner Blasts Ruining Baseball Narrative\n\nThe southpaw’s ERA ranked second among Dodgers relievers with more than 20 appearances, only behind Edgardo Henriquez.\n\nDreyer has been recognized time and time again for his excellence in 2025, and had also been named as the best reliever to make his debut in 2025 by MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince.\n\nMore news: Dodgers’ Kyle Tucker Reveals Reason For New Jersey Number\n\n“Really, an impossible choice, because there are always young relievers with sick stuff who come up and dazzle from their debuts onward,” wrote Castrovince. “This season has no shortage. If we put in a limit of at least 40 innings pitched, then the Cardinals’ Matt Svanson, White Sox’s Mike Vasil, Blue Jays’ Braydon Fisher, Padres’ David Morgan, Marlins’ Cade Gibson, Rays’ Ian Seymour and Rockies’ Juan Mejia all have strong cases, with adjusted ERA+ marks well above the league average.\n\n“The 26-year-old Dreyer, though, is worthy of this particular brand of love because of the large workload (72 1/3 innings) and reliable relief work (1.05 WHIP, 2.86 ERA) he’s provided for a first-place Dodgers team that has a behemoth roster but has often been scrambling in the bullpen. Dreyer has a calmness that belies his inexperience.”\n\nMore news: What Dodgers Games Will Be on NBC Prime Time in 2026?\n\nDreyer’s dominance last season stretched into the postseason as well, with the left-hander making four appearances in the playoffs. He threw 0.2 scoreless innings against the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card round, then followed that up with a scoreless inning against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS.\n\nHe made two more appearances in the World Series, and didn’t allow a run through either of them.\n\nDreyer is sure to play a big part in a Dodgers bullpen which struggled to produce towards the end of 2025, and he will hope to have a similarly solid season in 2026 as the Dodgers look to win their third consecutive World Series title.",

    "description": "Nottingham Forest's hopes of a top-eight finish in the Europa League - and a straight route to the last 16 - are hanging by a thread after a one costly minute leads to defeat by Sporting Braga.",
    "fullText": "It was hard to see how Thursday night could have gone much worse for Nottingham Forest.\n\nAs they fell to a dour defeat in Braga, they completed the unholy trinity of scoring an own goal, missing a penalty and receiving a red card.\n\nHaving begun the evening with hopes of pushing on for a top-eight finish in the Europa League - and securing automatic qualification for the last 16 - Sean Dyche's side head home with those hopes all-but dashed.\n\nEven victory over Ferencvaros in the final round of league phase games is unlikely to be enough to spare them a two-legged play-off to reach the last 16.\n\nWhile the result was bad, the fact the travelling supporters booed their side off at both half-time and full-time tells you the performance was just as poor.\n\nThe outcome at least could all have been so different had Morgan Gibbs-White managed to convert a 53rd-minute penalty.\n\nBut the midfielder's effort was saved - and 55 seconds later, Braga were in front through a Ryan Yates own goal.\n\n\"One minute of madness in a game that we never looked in trouble,\" Dyche told TNT Sports.\n\n\"We miss a penalty - that can happen. The reaction in the next minute or so... we lose the game to a poor goal.\n\n\"They get a lift and the crowd go mad, we knock off a bit, and an unfortunate situation for Yatesy. Very frustrated.\"\n\nThat Braga managed to win the match without having a single shot on target - becoming only the second team in Europa League history to do so - will only add to Forest's frustration.\n\nBut while Braga, who did hit the post at 1-0, might not have offered a huge amount going forward, Forest were little better for much of the game.\n\nForest slump to Braga defeat with Yates own goal\n\nDyche had made seven changes from Saturday's 0-0 Premier League draw against leaders Arsenal. The last time he altered the side so drastically was at Wrexham in the FA Cup.\n\nAfter exiting the competition that night, the Forest boss was highly critical of the players who had come into the team but he more forgiving on this occasion.\n\n\"There's effort there but the cutting edge... we want more of that,\" he added.\n\n\"We are in a weird situation where I have to protect certain players. We know the Premier League is massively important but we wanted to do well in this competition and we still do.\n\n\"It's a fine line, it's a juggling act. On one hand you want to protect some players and give everyone a chance.\"\n\nYates felt that Forest were slightly hard done by to lose and that the visitors \"controlled the most part of the game\".\n\n\"We are frustrated because I think we did enough to win the game,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"We've missed an opportunity. Not that we were terrible but we can definitely do better. We have to move on quickly.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott saw it slightly differently and highlighted the added blow of Elliot Anderson's late sending off.\n\n\"The perfect way to sum it up is a mess,\" he told TNT Sports. \"Collectively it wasn't good enough.\n\n\"To top it off and lose someone of the stature of Anderson when you have a massive game next week is devastating.\n\n\"You often look at games and wonder if there are any positives. I don't think there are any tonight.\n\n\"A terrible night, terrible performance on what should have been a marvellous evening.\"\n\nAnderson will miss next week's final group game and Forest will hope the ban is not extended to include the likely play-off in February.\n\nThose extra games could be a problem for Forest at such a busy stage of the season as they chase Premier League survival - and going into them without their star midfielder would stretch the squad even further.\n\nUltimately, Forest will feel it is a situation they could have avoided.\n\n\"You might come away with a draw, but you shouldn't really lose that game,\" Dyche said.\n\nBut in \"one minute of madness\", lose it they did.\n\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Nottingham Forest - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "The three biggest questions to be answered for the Lake Show in 2026.",
    "fullText": "15 days remain until the Lake Show make their arrival in 2026.\n\nAnd it’ll be a suspenseful 15 days.\n\nAfter falling narrowly short in a Hollywood-esque adventure to a national title, Northwestern women’s lacrosse finds itself in an extremely intriguing position. Kelly Amonte Hiller has done an overhaul in the transfer portal to shore up the attack in what seems to be a “win-now” situation for NU.\n\nWith four graduate students joining the program, it seems as though the ‘Cats are going for broke this coming season: national championship or bust.\n\nKey word: national. Not just a Big Ten title, or even a Final Four appearance.\n\nNorthwestern has positioned itself to take it all, and the ’Cats Express will surely be a fun ride to jump on when it takes off from Chestnut Hill in just two weeks time.\n\nAny subway system has its major stops along the way. Each train that a passenger boards has that one robust, active, always busy stop in the middle of the city.\n\nWhat makes the ‘Cats Express so different this year is that it has three major stops along its course — stops where passengers can get a glance at where the program’s future track lines may run, and, more importantly, where this team’s final destination might be.\n\nAnd like any subway system with those major stops, these three jump off the map to anyone who boards the train.\n\nStops so recognizable that one can spot them with their eyes shut.\n\nStop number one to mark on your maps is Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nJust a few months ago, the lacrosse world had been raving about Boston College having Northwestern’s number. After defeating the ‘Cats in the 2024 national championship, and dominating them in Evanston in the No. 1 vs. No. 2 season opener last year, the Eagles seemed to have cemented themselves as superior to their midwestern foes.\n\nThat seemed to ring true through three quarter of their Final Four matchup against NU, when BC led by five with only fifteen minutes to go.\n\nWe all know how that story ended, with the Cardiac ‘Cats snatching triumph from the deepest depths of treachery in an all-time finish.\n\nHowever, NU needed one more comeback effort in the title game in order to reach the mountaintop again.\n\nAnd who denied them that storybook ending?\n\nCarolina blue haunted the ‘Cats all spring last year. Not only did the Tar Heels delegate NU to the position of national runner-up for the second straight season, but they were the only program left unconquered by Northwestern in 2025.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, the Tewaaraton award ended up going home with UNC, despite Madison Taylor having one of the greatest offensive seasons in the history of the sport. Instead, Chloe Humphrey walked the stage.\n\nInside Lacrosse projects UNC at No. 1 and Northwestern at No. 2, and looking back at the history between the two teams, that projection seems quite accurate. March 25, however, serves the ‘Cats a golden opportunity to begin to rectify last year’s shortcomings with a win over their biggest adversaries amidst the ever-intimidating, always ruthless Tar Heel Nation.\n\nSimply put, NU’s quest for its second national title of the decade will need to find a pathway around the roadblock that North Carolina presents.\n\nWhat a surprise. Stop two: Ryan Fieldhouse, where the next leader of the program will make herself felt in 2026.\n\nWith Madison Taylor and Lucy Munro heading into their final years of Northwestern lacrosse, there’s a gargantuan void that’s soon to be left for coach Hiller to fill — a hole that’s threatening to jeopardize the ‘Cats esteemed position as one of the best teams in the nation.\n\nAditi Foster seems to be the frontrunner to take the reins for NU in the near future. Her 12 goals and five assists don’t appear enticing at first glance, but the Philadelphia native was stellar in moments where Northwestern needed a spark.\n\nFoster provided a goal to give the ‘Cats some much-needed cushion in their victory over No. 6 Syracuse, netted the game winner in the finals of the Big Ten Tournament vs. Maryland, and pulled NU within two in their comeback win against BC in Gillette Stadium.\n\nDespite the influx of transfers to shore up the attack, namely Madison Epke and Olivia Adamson, it’s probable that Foster will get her share of starts in the lineup this season.\n\nAnother important piece to keep an eye on will be Taylor Lapointe, who showed her versatility against Colorado and USC last season, displaying the ability to score, find teammates at the arc, and cause chaos defensively.\n\nAnother two attackers that’ll be in the mix are Claire Marosi and Claire Ratke, whose appearances have been scarce since arriving in Evanston, but will pick up steam as time progresses.\n\nDespite the losses to the program, pending season’s end, Northwestern remains with national contender potential with the talent on their roster. What’s of most importance to the ‘Cats is a player to step up and spearhead the program for the years ahead.\n\nStop three to highlight is one that NU lax is starting to build into its own “Times Square” of sorts: a robust location that’s guaranteed to draw a crowd.\n\nNorthwestern Medicine Field at Martin Stadium. The site for the NCAA Women’s Lacrosse Final Four this year, which could provide a thrilling end to one of the most storied college careers ever.\n\nMaddy Taylor has nearly done it all at Northwestern. She’s a national champion, an All-American, a Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, a Tewaaraton finalist and the NCAA record holder for most goals in a season.\n\nThe one blemish on her resume is as such: she’s never led the ‘Cats to the mountaintop.\n\nWhen Taylor and company won it all in 2023, that company included a “who’s who” of the NCAA’s best: Izzy Scane, Erin Coykendall and Hailey Rhatigan, just to name a few. Recognizing this is not to be confused as an attempt to discredit her role as a first-year: Taylor tied for the game-high in goals in that national title game against BC, which is only a snapshot of what she did. But it’s hard to deny that the support around her was astounding, and can be categorized as one of the deepest rosters of the past decade.\n\nFast forward to 2025, when that support is long gone and Taylor is now the focal point of the offense, dominating ranked opponent after ranked opponent and having her way offensively.\n\nUntil she reached the national championship.\n\nTaylor was completely erased from the Northwestern attack, held scoreless on a measly three shot attempts. When the lights were turned up to maximum brightness, the nation’s top scorer was nowhere to be found.\n\nHer senior year is one that can be characterized as her redemption arc: her opportunity to trek back to the biggest game of the year, only this time, to exhibit her dominance when it matters most.\n\nOne final chance to lead. One final chance to triumph. One final chance to cement her legacy as a Northwestern great, while doing so on the legendary lakefront, which has seen countless moments etched in the lore of Wildcat athletics forever.\n\nWith a national championship, Taylor can join that sacred lore as one of the best to ever touch a lacrosse stick.",

Prescott is joined by Stefon Diggs, Aidan Hutchinson, Trevor Lawrence, and Christian McCaffrey, and in this particular case each of the five players are coming back from injuries sustained during the 2024 season.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this that way because Comeback Player of the Year can sometimes be a fluky award in terms of the person that wins it. The name implies that the players are coming back from something and that is often assumed to be an injury. And while that is the case for this year’s finalists the past has seen some players win the award after “coming back” from simply having a down season that had no injury as a factor.\n\nPrescott won the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year Award a few years ago and also won Offensive Rookie of the Year after his first season in the league.

    "fullText": "Indiana's perfect season is built for the silver screen. The Hoosiers officially became the biggest long-shot national champions since at least 2001. They put the bow on their storybook run with a 27-21 win over Miami, the school their Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Fernando Mendoza, wanted to play for when he grew up a walk away from its campus.\n\nMendoza put his body on the line to score an epic fourth-quarter touchdown, and Indiana sealed its first football title with an interception that ended the Hurricanes' potential game-winning drive.\n\nIf a movie is made chronicling Indiana's turnaround from Big Ten laughingstock to college football royalty, it could be a box-office hit — that is, if the viewership numbers from Monday night's title game are any indication.\n\nBecause the thriller at Hard Rock Stadium drew 30.1 million viewers and was the second-most-watched College Football Playoff national championship game, according to ESPN PR.\n\nThe 2026 #NationalChampionship ft. @CanesFootball & @IndianaFootball delivered:\n\n📈 30.1M viewers, 33.2M peak\n🏈 2nd most-watched #CFBPlayoff title game\n📺 2nd best cable telecast ever\n🏆 Most-viewed non‑NFL sports event since '16 World Series Gm 7\n\n🔗 https://t.co/IFdlYlrxmc pic.twitter.com/rLM3Yt9iIp\n\n— ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) January 22, 2026\n\nThe CFP debuted during the 2014 season.

At the time, viewership numbers were down compared to the season prior when Michigan and Washington brought in approximately 25 million viewers.\n\nCollege football's biggest game delivered this time around, and not just due to Indiana's Hollywood script.

    "fullText": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery may not believe his team are Premier League title contenders - but he is \"dreaming\" of Europa League glory after reaching the last 16.\n\nVilla defeated Fenerbahce 1-0 in Turkey to ensure a top-eight league-phase finish with a game to spare.\n\nOn Sunday, the Spaniard warned Villa are \"not top-five contenders\" after they lost 1-0 at home to Everton.\n\nShould Villa finish outside the Premier League's top four - or top five if England is awarded an extra qualifying berth - their only hope of Champions League football next season will be through winning the Europa League.\n\nFormer Seville, Arsenal and Paris St-Germain boss Emery has won the Europa League a record four times as manager, last doing so with Villarreal in 2021, and was managing his 100th game in the competition on Thursday.\n\nHe told the media \"we have clear objectives in this competition to be a contender for a trophy\" after his side's victory in Istanbul.\n\n\"[We want] To be a contender in case we need this trophy to play in the Champions League. Through our league [it] is very difficult,\" he added.\n\n\"I am dreaming to be here getting trophies and the Europa is one objective we have this year.\"\n\nDespite being the seventh-most successful club in English football by trophies won, Villa's last piece of major silverware was the League Cup in 1996.\n\nSancho scores first Villa goal to seal last-16 spot\n\nWho can join Aston Villa in Europa League last 16?\n\nAston Villa are on a superb run of form.\n\nThey have won 20 of their past 25 matches (D1, L4) with only Arsenal (21) having won more among teams in Europe's big-five leagues during that period.\n\nTheir blip on Sunday against Everton meant they missed out on the chance to move second, within four points of Premier League leaders Arsenal - Emery's old club.\n\nHe made six changes against Fenerbahce and his side dominated, with the 1-0 scoreline flattering the 28-time Turkish champions.\n\nAfter the match Emery praised his players for \"respecting\" the competition, adding he was \"so, so happy\" with their response.\n\nVilla's match-winner Jadon Sancho scored his first goal for the club on his 19th appearance since joining on loan from Manchester United in September.\n\n\"It's nice to have a manager that backs you and obviously believes in you,\" said the 25-year-old forward who has not played for United since August 2024, and whose contract with them expires this summer.\n\n\"He [Emery] just keeps on telling me to be positive every time I play. Every opportunity I get I'm going to try and do 100% and hopefully I can deliver goals.\"\n\nSancho has only started two Premier League games this season, but in the Europa League he has been in Villa's starting line-up for each of their past five matches.\n\nVilla have played 12 times since the start of December, and by guaranteeing a top-eight league-phase finish avoided a two-legged play-off in February.\n\nEmery still played striker Ollie Watkins for the full 90 minutes on Thursday, and star midfielder Morgan Rogers for 74 minutes.\n\nHe was also able to give Tyrone Mings his first start since November, after the defender recovered from a thigh injury.\n\nAmadou Onana, who has been out with a hamstring issue, was also given a late cameo off the bench and is another key player returning.\n\n\"[We are] building the team with some circumstances not helping us,\" Emery told TNT Sports.\n\n\"But next week we can finish the transfer window and hopefully we can get everything we need to complete the squad for the next months and the competitions we have.\"\n\nLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Aston Villa - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Baltimore Ravens RB Derrick Henry shares his thoughts on New York Giants head coach John Harbaugh.",
    "fullText": "There is no tougher runner in the NFL right now than Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer is currently the NFL's leader in touchdowns (127) and rushing yards (13,018) among active players, and his highlight reel is filled with defenders bouncing off his invincible body.\n\nHenry began his career in Tennessee and moved to Baltimore two years ago to better his chances at a Super Bowl and played those two seasons under head coach John Harbaugh, who was fired last week by the Ravens after 18 seasons.\n\n“I love Coach. He’s a great leader,\" Henry told The Escapist in a recent interview. \"Enjoyed my time with him in Baltimore. Kind of sad that it ended while I came to Baltimore, but I wish Coach the best. I definitely appreciate everything that he’s taught us and taught me through these last two years of me being a new guy.”\n\nHarbaugh has naturally moved on to the New York Giants to become their new head coach.\n\nHenry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner and five-time Pro Bowler, was asked how Harbaugh treats his players. His answer should delight the Giants and their fans.\n\n“He’s had a great philosophy about how he ran the organization and how he treated the players,\" Henry said. \"After we won, he would point out every single player that had an impact on the game. Even if it doesn’t get noticed nationally, he made sure that they’re appreciated throughout the organization for the effort that they put into the team.”\n\nBut, more importantly, Harbaugh will bring structure and discipline back to the Giants. After 10 double-digit losing seasons over the past 12 years, the Giants and their fans are finally getting a coach deserving of the title.\n\n\"As we begin a new chapter in New York, our focus is simple,\" Harbaugh said in his introductory press conference with th Giants this week, \"it starts with building a team that is physical and tough, that's capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end, and especially at the end, that understands how to finish, that is smart and disciplined, that plays the game the way it should be played, and that everybody watching it, including those playing it, would be proud of.\n\n\"We're going to work together. We have great and talented people to accomplish a shared mission. There will be a relentless commitment to this organization, to this city and the fans to do things the right way every single day. Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team. Thanks, Dad, for that. It'll always be about that. Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Derrick Henry: New York Giants' John Harbaugh 'a great leader'",

    "fullText": "In the UK, 98% of two-year-olds watch screens on a typical day, on average for more than two hours – and almost 40% of three- to five-year-olds use social media. Could this lead to alarming outcomes?\n\nAt Stoke primary school in Coventry, there are many four-year-olds among those starting in reception class who can’t sit still, hold a pencil or speak more than a four-word sentence. Lucy Fox, the assistant headteacher and head of foundations, is in no doubt what is causing this: their early exposure to screens, and a lot of it. When the children experiment with materials and creativity, and make things in the classroom, she says, “We notice a lot of children will cut pieces of cardboard out and make a mobile phone or tablet, or an Xbox controller. That’s what they know.”\n\nAt another school in Hampshire, a longtime reception teacher says in the last few years she has noticed children getting frustrated if activities aren’t instant and seamless – something she thinks comes from playing games on a phone or tablet. There is a lack of creativity and problem-solving skills, noticeable when the children are playing with Lego or doing jigsaw puzzles and turning the pieces to fit. “I find their hand-eye coordination isn’t very good, and they find puzzles difficult. Doing a puzzle on an iPad, you just need to hold and move it on the screen. They get really frustrated and I feel like there are certain connections the brain is not making any more.”\n\nThere is also something of an attitude shift, she says – a kind of individualism that she’s convinced comes from playing alone on a device. “We are having to model to children how to be with others, how you work as a team, how you share things, because they’re so used to having their own time, doing their own thing. We’re losing a big part of being human, and if these young children don’t get all those skills, they’re not going to pick them up later on.”\n\nEarlier this month, the government announced it would be issuing new guidance on screen use for under-fives in April, after a report it commissioned found 98% of two-year-olds were watching screens on a typical day, with the average duration more than two hours. Those who spent the most time – around five hours – had limited vocabulary compared with those who spent the least, and were twice as likely to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.\n\n“It’s a trend that we’ve been seeing for quite a long time,” says Pasco Fearon, a professor of developmental psychopathology at University College London and the director of the Children of the 2020s study. “Look at studies getting all the way back to the turn of the century – you can see that screen time, on the whole, has been increasing.” That’s true for all of us, not just for children. Of the impact on children, Fearon says: “I’m sure it’s a factor that a lot of parents, like the rest of us, are on their phones. It’s becoming very dominant in everyone’s lives.” The data in this study, he says, “can be quite a useful focal point to start thinking: Wait, is this what we want? A little bit of a reset might be useful for everyone.”\n\nThis report comes on the back of other recent research showing very young children’s screen access is increasing. In October, the American research organisation Pew found that 38% of parents of under-twos said their child uses or interacts with a smartphone, and 8% of under-fives had their own smartphone. In the UK, Ofcom’s research has found that 19% of children aged three to five had their own mobile phone in 2024, and that 37% of children this age – more than 800,000 kids – were using at least one social media app, up from 29% in 2023 (though the majority use it with their parents’ supervision).\n\nThe Conservatives have just pledged to follow Australia and ban social media for under-16s, and the Labour government has said it will consider doing the same. (Australia’s ban, incidentally, includes YouTube but not YouTube Kids, which is aimed at younger viewers – so it does not necessarily address the problem of excess screen time.)\n\nUnlike for teenagers, little research has been done on the impact of social media on the youngest children. At the extreme end, all children are at risk of sexual abuse online. In November last year, the NSPCC reported online grooming crimes had reached record highs, with the youngest victim being just four.\n\nMore is becoming known about the impact of young children exposed to excessive screen time, though. In 2025, a New Zealand study found that young children who had watched more than 90 minutes a day had below-average vocabulary, communication and numeracy at the ages of four and eight, and that more screen time meant even poorer outcomes.\n\nToday Kindred Squared, an organisation that campaigns for early years education and development, releases its latest report on children’s school readiness. It found that more than half of teachers believed spending too much time on screens – by children and their parents alike – was the single biggest factor contributing to the child not being ready to start school. “We know that screen time is a problem,” says the CEO, Felicity Gillespie. This year, reception teachers reported 28% of children were unable to use a book correctly, for instance tapping or swiping the pages as if it were an electronic device.\n\n“In cases of higher usage,” says Gillespie, “there is a real negative impact on language acquisition. It’s not that surprising when you think about how language is developed in babies, that it is through that serve-and-return interaction with adults – the baby makes a noise, the parent makes a noise back. The baby smiles, the parent smiles. It’s that two-way interaction that fires the baby’s brain. Nought to two is the period when our brains are growing at their fastest rate, so the earlier you put babies in front of screens, the more they are missing out [on] those early interactions, which is where the hard-wiring of the brain is happening.”\n\nThe early years, says Gillespie, “are the foundation for everything that follows, for mental and physical health, wellbeing, your happiness, your success in relationships. I think it comes back to this need for better information for parents and clear, simple, unequivocal guidance. Tell them the truth. Tell them what the evidence says.”\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends children under two should get no screen time at all, and for those aged two to four, a maximum of one hour. Is that realistic in today’s parenting world? Gillespie acknowledges the latest study showing two-year-olds are watching two hours a day. “Then what we then need to do is give parents the information about why the WHO advises that, to inform people about the preciousness of these early years and the importance of brain development.” The government, she hopes, will “give parents the kind of practical, real-world guidance that takes account of the fact that, I think, we’ve probably missed the boat on the WHO guidance”.\n\nThe Covid pandemic accelerated screen use (many children in current reception classes and year 1 were born in that first year), but it had been steadily rising before that. “My referrals have been increasing over the past 10 years,” says Sandy Chappell, an early years speech and language therapist. During the lockdowns, she says, it was “not just that children were isolated from other children, but also that parents were relying more on screens to pacify young children. I had many parents in impossible situations, where they were trying to work from home and had babies and toddlers to entertain at the same time, so they had no choice but to rely on screens.”\n\nShe has sympathy for parents who rely on screens now. “Absolutely. It’s unbelievably difficult.” Fearon too, talking about the research that is driving the government’s advice, stresses it’s not about blaming parents. The study found children from disadvantaged families were more likely to spend time on screens. “This is about understanding the context in which this is happening, and how people are making the day work when there are challenges families are experiencing, financially, and in terms of work and all the pressures of daily life. If we’re trying to support families, it’s partly about giving them really clear advice, but also about giving more help to families, particularly those who are experiencing economic disadvantage. That’s going to give them a bit more slack to be able to play more, talk to their children more, be more engaged in the way that they’d like to.”\n\nIn Chappell’s clinic, she is seeing children with “poor attention and listening skills, poor turn-taking and social skills, as well as poor vocabulary and expressive language”. Many have their own electronic devices, and although Chappell has seen the stats about social media use, it’s not something she’s aware of. “Parents don’t tend to tell me that’s what’s happening, because I think instinctively they know it’s not a good thing.” And while some content is better than others – “things like [the BBC’s] CBeebies, where [many programmes are developed with] educational value by psychologists and educationists” – what matters more is duration. “We really need to cut the time down,” says Chappell.\n\nShe can spot the children who have spent a lot of time on screens: she has seen preschoolers, she says, who will spend seven or eight hours a day on a screen. Other children might be shy to begin with, but will soon start talking to her or will go straight to investigate her toy collection. Those who have spent a lot of time on screens, she says, don’t tend to interact with her and “don’t seem to be particularly interested in toys. They can’t follow simple instructions. They’re wandering around the room – and I’m not talking about young toddlers here, but three- and four-year-olds. They start school without even the basic skills that they need in order to be able to learn.”\n\nThis is often when the child is referred to her, with parents worrying they’re not ready for school. “Preschool children can catch up to a certain extent if the screens are reduced to a bare minimum and time is spent on building other skills. It becomes more difficult once they get to school, and we are finding that these issues are following children right through school. Their language levels at age four are one of the biggest predictors of their later academic achievement at GCSE level and beyond. So it really is important that we put the work in with children way before they go to school.”\n\nTo accommodate 60 reception children, but without space within the school, Stoke Primary turned a wooden “roundhouse” (a simple octagonal wooden structure), which had been in their forest school area, into a new classroom, complete with rugs, fairy lights and, inadvertently, no wifi – and therefore no screens. At first, as Fox wrote in TES (formerly the Times Educational Supplement), this seemed an “inconvenience” and a “hurdle”. It ended up transforming her thinking on screens in schools; her previous job had been in a school which prided itself on giving each child an iPad.\n\n“Very quickly we realised the impact that it was having on the children,” says Fox now. By the end of that first autumn term, 72% of the “roundhouse” children were considered to be “on track” compared with 44% of the children in the traditional classroom. When they switched the classes later in the year, they got similar results.\n\nThe roundhouse style, in which children sit in a circle, “forces communication and language to come before anything, which is so important. We have quite a significant amount of English as an additional language compared with other schools – 60% of our children in reception last year – so the language skills that it’s pulling out of them is remarkable.” Instead of the usual schemes, or structured lesson plans that use PowerPoint and other software, “there is none of that in the roundhouse. It forces you to go back to basics. I had to build up the confidence of those teachers to feel they could do that, and could make their own decisions about what they knew was best for their children. We all know that we live in a digital age, and there is no stopping digital growth. But to what extent are we using tech to replace the things that we know are best for our children?” Both reception classes no longer use screens for teaching, though the older classes do.\n\nFox is turning her attention to the newest generation of teachers coming through. “They’re from a different generation,” she says – people who have grown up with screens themselves. “How can we give them the confidence to know what’s best, and to put the scheme down and just connect with their children?”",

    "description": "This blog post explores the historical accuracy of medieval city-builder video games.",
    "fullText": "May 01, 2020 \n\n • \n Socio-Economic History\n and Medievalism\n\n • \n\nThis blog post explores the historical accuracy of medieval city-builder video games.\n\nSince many of us are working from home in these trying times, it seems safe to assume that more people than ever are indulging in playing the occasional computer game. A city builder is a specific kind of computer game in which you design a city, extract resources, set up production chains and ensure that your settlement grows. City builders are very similar to strategy games as they reward patience and strategy. In this article, I will take a look at one sub-genre of the city builder, the medieval city builder, and explain how this gaming genre relates to our knowledge of medieval settlement planning.\n\nThe city builder has its origins far back in the 1990s in the combination of the strategy genre and the management genre, leading to games such as Sim City (1989), Caesar (1992) and Age of Empires (1997).\n\nIt did not take long before medieval-themed city builders popped up. We may think of Settlers (1993) and Knights and Merchants (1998). In addition, the Anno games (1998-2019), although initially set in the 1600s basically had a medieval theme.\n\nThese games often start with plopping down a village center on a promising location near abundant resources. You then continue to gather these resources which grant you building materials for building new homes and facilities for your settlement.\n\nSetting up specialized production chains might involve growing grain, milling the grain for flour and turning the flour into bread which feeds your villages. Similarly, another production chain might involve rearing sheep for their wool, turning the wool into cloth and turning the cloth into clothing. When done correctly, the reward of correct investments and planning is that you see your settlement grow.\n\nThis often leads to settlements growing organically from a couple of houses around a community center to a larger settlement with hundreds of people. However logical such an organic growth of a settlement might seem, it is not historically accurate.\n\nAny gameplay loop that tells a story of linear settlement growth is incongruent with how a medieval economy worked (see Foussier 2004). Medieval villagers were often living on the edge of subsistence. Agricultural surpluses were skimmed by the church and the feudal lords. Bad harvests, banditry, warfare and disease might decimate a village community at any time. For this very reason, the demography of many European villages remained relatively stable between the twelfth and the eighteenth century. It may therefore be clear that the gameplay loop of city builders pivots around the concept of doing the historically exceptional (i.e. growing a settlement to a town) and thereby strays far from what actually happened in the lives of our medieval forebears. \n\nA notable exception to this genre trope is the game Banished (2014) in which high mortality rates and bad weather do seriously stifle any kind of linear growth. In this city builder you are constantly fighting the odds and settlement growth is not guaranteed. However, also in Banished it is your goal to overcome the stagnation and lead your settlement to expansion.\n\nA thing that is rarely touched upon in medieval city builders is how complex village life actually was. This can be exemplified by how the community related to its overlords. Land ownership here is key. Land in the community might be owned by a lord, a local liegeman, a monastery or even directly by the duke or count. Taxes, rents and tithes were the organisational structures in which the landowner was tied to the farmers who worked the fields. Often the payment of taxes and tithes was linked to feast days and the visit of the tax collector represented a big event in the agricultural year. An interesting side note is that some obligations which the commoners had to the lord and the church (such as seigneurial duties like working a mill) might drain the community from the needed manpower for tilling the land. Furthermore, a rural community that was its own seigneury had access to a law court with sheriff, aldermen and a local militia (Middle Dutch schutterie) to fight off bandits with. Harsh capital punishments were set in place to deter anyone from raiding the farms and hamlets and the village gallows were often the first thing one saw when approaching a medieval settlement.\n\nBut something that is much more fundamental to the theme of a settlement building game, is how medieval settlements were actually planned and grew. Landscape historians and archaeologists have acquired a lot of insight into how this worked.\n\nLet's start with the realization that medieval settlements in their first stages of development were planned and laid out according to a specific design. In my own research into the settlement history of West-Brabant (southern Netherlands, from 1000 to 1300 CE) I have encountered the following types.\n\nHere is a sketch of a Brabantine circular manor (Middle Dutch vroonhoeve). This is a reinforced circular homestead with moat, often next to a bend in the river, containing several farms and a fan-like plot pattern radiating out from it. Such manors were often called BORCH.\n\nHere is a sketch of a Brabantine street settlement, often built with exploitation of nearby fenland in mind. It consists of a line of farms with associated evenly sized rectangular plots built in a line perpendicular to a raised road.\n\nHere is a more complex exploitation village which is set up with a moated enclosed church homestead and a central meadow as its center. There is a line of farms next to the road. The arable land to the east is bordered by a ditch supplying fresh drinking water (Middle Dutch bansloot). In layout, this type represents a hybrid between the two earlier settlement types.\n\nLet us first make clear that these different types of exploitation settlements often existed alongside each other and can be found in one and the same region. In part, the different types reflect different chronological layers but some types were also more suited to certain geographical environments than others.\n\nSo how were these settlements planned? Many medieval exploitation enterprises were initiated by a monastery or a consortium of free men who were granted permission by (or bought permission from) the feudal lord to “colonize” the wilderness.\n\nClearing the wooded landscape in order to create arable land was done by cutting away the trees and bushes (Middle Dutch rode) or, alternatively, burning it away in controlled fires (Middle Dutch brant).\n\nLand surveyors sent by the lord would then measure out the block or strips that would be taken in cultivation. Strips of arable land were often 1250m deep (6 Middle Dutch voorlingen = furlongs) so that the plough could go straight in a long line before having to turn. Important blocks or strips were demarcated by hedges, earthwork, woodwork, ditches or roads. Medieval names for these blocks often survived into the modern day.\n\nThe presence of drinking water (a river or a brook) in the vicinity was an important factor in choosing the location for the settlement. The vicinity of water entailed risk and reward because flooding was an ever present danger. Floods could devastate arable land but might also fertilize it. Meadows in particular were often situated in flood areas.\n\nSo how was such a settlement managed? First of all, the quality of the soil had to be carefully controlled by crop rotation: specific crops were sown on different segments of the arable land with one part laying fallow to recover from the tilling (English three-field system, Dutch drieslagstelsel). The cattle and sheep were put out to pasture on the common meadows guarded by a shepherd or cowherd. Pigs were allowed to forage in the nearby forests and killed in autumn before the winter starvation set in.\n\nRoads and rivers were important for transport of crops and livestock. These roads, some of them paved, some of them not, needed to be maintained. They were essential to the payment of the tithe, since tithe collectors assessed the harvest on the field and later collected the sheaves on the side of the road.\n\nThe buildings within the community also needed maintenance. Farmhouses, community barns and stables were made of wood and had to be rebuilt every few generations, only the name of the farm or homestead being continued.\n\nSo what kind of threats did a medieval settlement face? First of all, the weather was an important factor which dictated the success of the harvest. Storms, droughts and floods could devastate the harvest and decimate the community.\n\nDiseases and epidemics were another danger threatening the community. The situation on the countryside was a lot better in this regard than in the medieval towns, but an epidemic could still mean the end of a village. Similarly, diseases among livestock impacted the medieval subsistence economy in a brutal way.\n\nThen there are the consequences of medieval warfare affecting the community: Armies that passed by could plunder the village, burn the farms and execute villagers at will. Or they could also demand supplies, food and provisions as an emergency \"tax\"\n\nBut war also brought indirect consequences; a liege lord calling the banners and levying troops from the village community might extract a large part of the adult men. Warfare also disrupted the trade networks that supplied a village with building materials and commodities.\n\nThen there were internal threats to the fabric of the village community. We may think of social unrest because of land disputes. Feuds could also tear a community apart with endemic vendetta’s causing death and despair. A socially unstable society was also more prone to internal accusations of heresy and witchcraft.\n\nSo, which of the above listed features could potentially contribute to a more historically accurate computer game about medieval settlement building? First of all, it would be more realistic if the settlement could first be planned out and was not forced to \"grow organically\" from a community center. The first settlement phase would be a test of how “successful” a layout is in adapting to the exigencies of the terrain and the needs of the community. Only after that initial layout proved successful, further expansions can be planned.\n\nSecondly, it would be more realistic if we could build both straight roads and curved roads, just as in Cities Skylines (2015), a modern city builder well known for its incredibly flexible layout tools. Incidentally, the tools of Cities Skylines can also be used to recreate medieval settlements, as was done by YouTube creator Play Curiously who constructed an impression of a medieval Croatian village.\n\nSuch a flexible road drawing tool can then also be used to lay out ditches, hedges and enclosures since these features were central to the medieval experience of the cultivated landscape.\n\nThirdly, It would be interesting to see a medieval-themed game embrace the concept of flood valleys that limit and endanger pasture and arable land. Other historical city builders such as Pharaoh (1999) and Children of the Nile (2004) already implemented this feature for their setting in Ancient Egypt. However, such a mechanic would likewise fit a medieval city builder and show the general public how medieval society dealt with seasonal flooding as well as the devastating effects that storm floods could have.\n\nAnd finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.\n\nThere are some good reasons why city building games are not that historically accurate and instead adhere to the established formula of the city building game.\n\nFirst of all, a linear growth model makes sense from a gameplay perspective, since it is rewarding to see your settlement grow.in a linear way. It fosters a feeling of progress and motivates the player to keep momentum and push through to the next expansion phase. Secondly, games are generally wary of punishing failure too harshly in order to avoid demoralizing the player. Thirdly, in order to facilitate path finding for the simulated villagers it is easier to implement a gridlike road and building system rather than an off-grid building system that allows for curvy roads. So far only Cities Skylines has managed to do this in a satisfactory way.\n\nLastly, for marketing purposes and recognizability, game developers generally don't stray too far from the image of the Middle Ages that the public is already acquainted with. For a medieval city builder this means windmills, industrious peasants, lots of sheep and stone castles. Things like land surveying, crop rotation and tithe collection do not fit this image and challenge the romanticized picture of the uneducated farmer in his pre-industrial environment.\n\nAlthough I think medieval-themed city building games could benefit from incorporating some of the things we know about medieval settlement history into the gameplay loop, it may not be desirable for game developers to stray too far from the established formula. The idea that medieval settlements developed organically according to messy road plans is strongly imbedded in popular perception. Allowing both straight and curved road building in medieval city builders, may serve to challenge some of the stereotypes that exist about medieval village life. And if you ask me, that would be a good thing for it is an enriching experience to see the world through the eyes of our medieval forebears. One may find out that their lives were not that different after all...",

    "fullText": "Chainguard OS exists for one reason: to give our customers the world’s most trusted, secure, customer-centric foundation for the modern software supply chain.\n\nToday, hundreds of organizations run Chainguard OS in production. It’s become one of the most trusted pieces of infrastructure in our customers’ ecosystems, and part of a solution that delivers stability and security at scale. Their businesses and missions depend on Chainguard OS, and we want to ensure that Chainguard OS users are the ones shaping its future. That’s why we’re announcing a customer-led steering committee for Chainguard OS and recruiting members starting today.\n\nThe Chainguard OS Fully User Directed Committee, or the Chainguard OS FUD Committee, will ensure Chainguard OS evolves with our customers’ needs at the forefront, rather than focusing on the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that’s often manufactured around purpose-built Linux distros. Behind the tongue-in-cheek name, there’s a serious commitment: the FUD Committee ensures that Chainguard OS will remain customer-governed, with every decision aligned with the long-term interests of its users.\n\nThe committee will include customer organizations of all sizes, industries, and geographies, with members from both engineering and security teams. Chainguard’s R&D teams will work closely with committee members to drive specific outcomes, including:\n\nContinuing to align our secure-by-default philosophy with the operational realities of high-scale production environments;\n\nHelping to define tomorrow’s standards and technical foundations to keep delivering trusted open source across use cases; and\n\nServing as an advisory and oversight layer that represents the diverse voices of the community that Chainguard OS serves\n\nThe FUD Committee’s mission is to ensure Chainguard OS remains the world’s most trusted, secure, customer-centric foundation for the modern software supply chain. Committee members will serve as the voice of the user to help Chainguard make technical and roadmap decisions informed by real-world enterprise requirements and needs. Key responsibilities for members will include:\n\nTechnical decision-making: Influencing the technical direction of Chainguard OS, advising and deciding on key technical paths to maintain flexibility and ecosystem compatibility. For example, this could include deciding whether Chainguard OS should continue to use the upstream APK client rather than forking to add additional functionality.\n\nRoadmap alignment: Aligning on upcoming features, architecture shifts, and package support.\n\nStrategic feedback: Providing early input on breaking changes, new security primitives, and distro-level optimizations.\n\nEcosystem advocacy: Identifying emerging technologies or language ecosystems that should be prioritized for Chainguard OS support.\n\nTogether, this structure gives customers real influence, fewer surprises, and an OS that evolves intentionally. The result is a more stable, predictable, and trusted OS, guided by the users who rely on it every day.\n\nChainguard OS isn’t just infrastructure; it’s a commitment. Like any commitment that matters, it works best when it’s shared. The FUD Committee is how we make that partnership real by keeping users in the loop, making decisions in the open, and building trust into the process from the start.\n\nChainguard is recruiting members to serve on the FUD Committee. Get in touch if you’re interested in participating.\n\nIntroducing “How We Lead”: Chainguard’s approach to developing the best managers\n\nGary Knox, Director of Culture and Belonging\n\nAnchore Enterprise now validates Chainguard Libraries: prevent 98% of Python malware and eliminate high-severity CVE toil\n\nChainguard Joins IBM PDE Factory to Advance Trusted Open Source Software for Public Sector Missions\n\nTom White, Senior Director, Public Sector Partnerships\n\nChainguard + Booz Allen: Delivering Trusted Open-Source Software to U.S. Government Agencies\n\nTom White, Senior Director, Public Sector Partners\n\nChainguard Named on the Cloud 100 and a Best Workplace in 2025\n\nLiz Egan, Chief Marketing Officer\n\nThe Chainguard Slack Community is Here!",

    "description": "Three robotics experts said humanoid robots need to move beyond flashy demos to performing tasks that are actually useful in the real world at scale.",
    "fullText": "Humanoid robots can do kung-fu and parkour. But can they make your morning coffee?\n\nAt a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale.\n\nJake Loosararian, the CEO of infrastructure startup Gecko Robotics, said that deploying robots into real-world environments was the major challenge facing the much-hyped industry.\n\n\"Deployment is the big problem right now for robotics, in terms of the ability for it to begin to make really large impacts, and for there to be a clear road map,\" said Loosararian.\n\nThe cofounder of the Pittsburgh-based company said that building reliable sources of data about the environments in which humanoid robots were operating would be critical for startups looking to move beyond flashy demos to real-world returns.\n\n\"You have to forward deploy and build your robots as close to the environment as possible. And that gives you the information and dataset that doesn't exist anywhere on the internet, anywhere on YouTube, about what these environments are like,\" Loosararian added.\n\nDaniela Rus, the director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said there was a gap between robots' ability to perform tasks in a laboratory and their ability to take on jobs traditionally done by humans in the real world.\n\n\"I can give you a robot that will fold your laundry and load your dishwasher, but it might cost you half a billion dollars,\" she said.\n\nRus said bridging that gap would require advancements in a humanoid robot's ability to perceive and manipulate the world through improved sensors and new AI models that can handle situations the robot may not have encountered before.\n\nShao Tianlan, the CEO of Chinese AI and robotics firm Mech-Mind, said that one big barrier to making humanoid robots useful in a factory environment was developing the capacity for them to learn directly from their human coworkers.\n\n\"If we want to deploy a robot, I would say demonstration is the most intuitive way to tell robots what to do. That's exactly how we humans teach others,\" he said.\n\nTianlan, who said that Mech-Mind had delivered more than 10,000 \"intelligent robots\" over the last 12 months, added that he did not believe humanoid robots needed \"Einstein-level\" intelligence to perform useful tasks, however.\n\nHe predicted that robots would take on some jobs performed by humans in controlled environments, such as in logistics and some service industries, in the next \"few hundred days.\"\n\nHumanoid robots are riding a wave of hype as companies like Tesla and Figure prepare to begin large-scale manufacturing of their machines. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made bold predictions about the company's Optimus robot, saying it could eliminate poverty and be the biggest product of all time.\n\nHowever, most humanoid robots have not yet been deployed in real-world environments. Many humanoid robot demos are staged in tightly controlled settings, and some use teleoperation, where human operators pilot the robots remotely.\n\nLoosararian called teleoperation the \"dirty little secret\" of robotics, adding that robotics companies had a responsibility to inform customers about whether their humanoid robots are operating autonomously or with human assistance.\n\n\"There's a lot of autonomy for certain tasks, but for the majority of the cases, for humanoids, it's learning in the environment, and it has to do that with teleoperation,\" Loosararian said.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to the stage at Davos in his first-ever World Economic Forum appearance, in which he revealed few new details.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk once called Davos \"boring af.\" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him.\n\nThe billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.\n\nMusk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning.\n\nInterviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of \"abundance for all,\" largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews.\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that \"ubiquitous\" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that \"AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively\" by 2030 or 2031.\n\n\"At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year.\n\nMusk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

    "title": "TikTok Strikes Deal for New U.S. Entity, Ending Long Legal Saga",
    "description": "The Chinese parent company for the popular video app said it had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new American TikTok to avoid a ban in the United States.",
    "fullText": "TikTok said on Thursday that its Chinese owner, ByteDance, had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new U.S. TikTok, concluding a six-year legal saga that saw the app banned by Congress, ensnared in politicking between global superpowers and forced into a 14-hour blackout in the United States.\n\nInvestors including the software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm will own more than 80 percent of the new venture. That list also includes the personal investment entity for Michael Dell, the tech billionaire behind Dell Technologies, and other firms, TikTok said. Adam Presser, TikTok’s former operations head, will be the chief executive for the U.S. TikTok.\n\nThe deal is intended to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States.The changes enable “our U.S. users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience,” said Shou Chew, TikTok’s chief executive, in an internal memo that called the move “great news.”\n\nThe agreement, which was hammered out over more than a year, resolves existential questions about TikTok’s future. The app — with its unceasing feed of lip syncs, political endorsements, conspiracy theories and skin care tutorials — would have had to leave the American market if it did not separate from ByteDance.\n\nIt was also the end of a legal odyssey. Since 2019, universities, several branches of the U.S. military, the vast majority of the House of Representatives and both President Trump and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have tried to ban or block TikTok, with unanimous support from the Supreme Court. Influencers, mobilized by the app, lobbied politicians and mounted protests to save their feeds and follower counts. TikTok became embroiled in a trade war between the United States and China, as the nations engaged in a heated contest over technology and industrial supremacy.\n\nBut the drama dragged on for so long and with so little consequence that even some who once fought to save the app had stopped worrying about it.\n\nNaomi Hearts, a 28-year-old content creator in Los Angeles who twice traveled to Washington as part of TikTok’s lobbying efforts, said she felt “detached” from the platform after years of upheaval.\n\n“I feel like it’s going to be another day,” Ms. Hearts said in an interview this week, anticipating the deal’s completion.\n\nIt was unclear how much, if anything, the deal would change for TikTok’s users in the United States. Since the outlines of the deal were released months ago, users have raised concerns about whether the new owners will overhaul the algorithm that personalizes their feeds. And experts have cautioned that the arrangement might fail to address the national security concerns that motivated the deal in the first place.\n\nThe driving force behind the deal is a federal law, passed in 2024 and upheld by the Supreme Court, that would have banned the app if it did not separate itself from ByteDance by early 2025. The app even went dark for 14 hours as the law’s deadline approached, sending some users into a tailspin. But Mr. Trump formally delayed the enforcement of the law several times after he took office again, as he pushed the company to reach a deal for new ownership.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15 percent of TikTok’s U.S. operations. ByteDance will own just under 20 percent.\n\nThe other investors include Mr. Dell’s office and a long list of investment firms, including affiliates of General Atlantic and Susquehanna, both of which had previously invested in ByteDance.\n\nThe majority of the seven-member board for the new U.S. TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees. Mr. Chew has a seat on the board.\n\nThe new venture will moderate content in TikTok’s feed, deciding which posts to leave up and which to take down. It’s unclear what the value of the American version of TikTok will be. Vice President JD Vance said in September that a U.S. TikTok company would be valued at $14 billion. ByteDance, by contrast, has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets.\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order in September that gave formal approval to the arrangement, a move required under the 2024 law.\n\nThe Chinese government has not publicly commented on TikTok’s announcement. For years, Beijing had been a major obstacle to finalizing a deal. When the United States first pushed to force a sale of TikTok, China amended its export control list to include technologies like algorithms and source codes, giving it the power to weigh in on any deal involving the app.\n\nLast year, Trump officials said they had won Beijing’s support for a deal. China’s statements were more vague.\n\nSeveral of the new investors have ties to Mr. Trump, raising concerns for some TikTok users that the app could start showing more content aligned with the president’s views or the positions of the U.S. government.\n\nLarry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire founder, has a close relationship with Mr. Trump, and lobbied the president directly on behalf of his son David Ellison’s bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. MGX has done business with the Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.\n\nAnupam Chander, a law and technology professor at Georgetown University, said that the deal allows for “more theoretical room for one side’s views to get a greater airing.”\n\n“My worry all along is that we may have traded fears of foreign propaganda for the reality of domestic propaganda,” he added.\n\nThere are also lingering concerns that ByteDance will still influence the app’s content. In addition to its stake, ByteDance will keep TikTok’s coveted algorithm, which it will license to the new U.S. entity.\n\nThat arrangement may fall short of the 2024 law, which required the sale to end any “operational relationship” between ByteDance and TikTok in the United States, critics said.\n\n“They may have saved TikTok,” said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Hudson Institute. “But the national security concerns are still going to continue.”\n\nThursday’s announcement is something of a mash up of two earlier proposals aimed at distancing TikTok from ByteDance.\n\nThe app’s troubles in the United States started almost at the same time as its stratospheric rise in popularity. It accelerated during the Covid pandemic, as the housebound masses turned to their phones to distract themselves with dance trends and memes.\n\nSoon after, Congress and the first Trump administration grew increasingly anxious that under Chinese law, ByteDance could be forced to provide personal information about Americans to Beijing’s military and intelligence apparatus.\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Trump threatened to ban TikTok. He then unsuccessfully tried to force ByteDance to sell the app to a consortium that included Oracle and Walmart.\n\nTikTok spent years pushing an alternative to a sale. Under that proposal, which the company called Project Texas, Oracle would oversee the app’s American user data on servers in the United States. ByteDance would still produce the app’s code, but its work would be audited by Oracle.\n\nSix years later, negotiators have settled on a consortium arrangement. Oracle is still a major player, and ByteDance is still involved, too.\n\n“We’ve gone round and round and ended up not too far from where we started,” said Lindsay Gorman, a former senior adviser in the Biden administration.\n\nMadison Malone Kircher contributed reporting.",

    "description": "During the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Elon Musk said there's a reason human's don't have longer lifespans.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk says he thinks aging will one day be solved.\n\nThe world's richest man said getting older was a \"very solvable problem\" during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.\n\n\"When we figure out what causes aging, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious. It's not a subtle thing,\" Musk said. \"The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body,\"\n\nBut Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives.\n\n\"You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place,\" he said. \"It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely.\"\n\nMusk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called \"boring af.\" His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information.\n\nDozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" one resident said.\n\nTrump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign.\n\nThe weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning.",

    "title": "From oil shocks to China disruptions, here are 5 black swan events that could derail markets this year",
    "description": "An oil shock, disruptions from China, and NATO conflicts are among BCA's list of unlikely but plausible events that would slam markets in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices soaring, the world economy falling into a recession, and the NATO alliance dissolving top the list of one research firm's possible black swan events in 2026.\n\nAnalysts at BCA Research listed five unlikely but plausible scenarios that could derail markets in 2026. In a note to clients, the firm said its annual list of potential black swans was slightly different this year and addressed only \"the most important\" risks, given that there are several black swan threats investors are discussing \"ad nauseam.\"\n\n\"It is a sign of the times that white swans are now in the minority,\" a team led by Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at the firm, wrote.\n\nHere's what the firm thinks are the five biggest outlier threats facing markets this year:\n\nOil prices could spiral if the Iranian government collapses. It is a possible event that would jeopardize a significant portion of the world's oil supply, and the inflationary impact of that shock could send the world economy into a recession, the firm speculated.\n\nBCA pointed to recent geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran and estimated there is a roughly 38% chance of a \"massive\" oil supply shock stemming from upheavals in the country. The estimated probability of a \"minor\" oil supply shock is 40%.\n\nA geopolitical shock in the Middle East usually causes crude prices to rise 3% over a month and 10% over three months, according to a historical analysis from BCA.\n\n\"But a real Iran shock would be much bigger than average,\" the firm wrote.\n\nThe strategists acknowledged that President Donald Trump is seeking to avoid an oil supply shock amid pressure from the coming midterm elections. Iran is also incentivized to \"leave oil alone\" in order to avoid attacks from other nations, which should prevent a shock, they said.\n\nThe world's inventory of oil also remains \"substantial\" at around 8 billion barrels, according to estimates from BCA's commodities and energy team.\n\nThe stock market could be in for another bout of turmoil similar to last year's stunning reveal of China's lower-cost AI model if the country pulls ahead of the US in the tech arms race.\n\nChina already spends more on research and development compared to the European Union. Patent applications in the nation also outpace applications in the US, Europe, South Korea, and Japan, BCA said, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nA technological breakthrough in Beijing could hit stock prices elsewhere around the world, BCA said. The firm pointed to the DeepSeek-fueled sell-off that erased $1 trillion $1 trillion from US stocks last year.\n\n\"This episode could happen again,\" BCA wrote.\n\nShould China make more progress on the AI front, OpenAI, ChatGPT's parent, could see its valuation \"evaporate,\" the firm said.\n\nStrategists later added that they saw a 50% chance of the tech bubble bursting this year.\n\nChina could become economically self-sufficient, removing a key constraint that prevents the country from escalating military conflict related to Taiwan, BCA suggested.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 39% probability that tensions between China and Taiwan would escalate this year. They also saw a 25% probability that tensions could break out in a proxy war, and a 7% probability that tensions could break out into a major war.\n\n\"What if China reaches technological self-sufficiency so that it can pursue a maximalist policy abroad?\" strategists wrote. \"If China falls deeper into demographic decline, debt-deflation, and dictatorship, then its powers have already peaked and its best chance for creating a sphere of influence is now.\"\n\nChina's economic statistics, like its industrial production, suggest that the nation is not preparing for war at the moment, the firm noted.\n\n\"It is not flashing red, at least not yet,\" the firm said of risk factors that could lead to military conflict.\n\nRussia could seize territory from a NATO member, sparking military conflict between Russia and the alliance. In the worst-case scenario, Russia could make nuclear threats against NATO, and the US may need to step in to \"restore the 'balance of terror,'\" strategists speculated.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 10% probability of a Russia-NATO war.\n\n\"Russia is currently engaged in a campaign to sabotage Europe's critical infrastructure. The US's lack of solidarity with the allies could encourage overreach. Russia could take its provocations too far,\" the BCA wrote.\n\nWhile the firm said it expects Russia to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine this year, it also pointed to the risk that Trump could provide Ukraine with new military support and funding, which could lead Moscow to become more aggressive in its war with Kyiv.\n\n\"Russia, endangered by the new demands of a longer war against a superior opponent, and having missed the chance to negotiate a favorable ceasefire, could become desperate and even more dangerous,\" the firm added.\n\nShould Russia attack another NATO nation and the US doesn't come to their defense, the alliance would become a \"dead letter,\" BCA said.\n\nAlternatively, the US could also invade Greenland and cause the alliance to dissolve, the firm said, though Trump ruled out using military force to acquire the territory.\n\nBCA said it doubted either scenario would occur, but pegged a 30% probability that the US could harm NATO in some way.\n\n\"The president is determined to seize Greenland at any cost, and to insist on the full extent of his constitutional power as executive and commander-in-chief, then obviously he could conquer Greenland, to hell with the consequences,\" strategists wrote.",

    "description": "Paramount is giving more power to a streaming data and insights executive as part of David Ellison's plan to make Paramount into a tech-first company.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is showing that his tech-first vision for Paramount Skydance isn't just talk.\n\nEllison is taking his data-focused strategy to a new level by elevating Jason Kim, Paramount's EVP of data and insights, to oversee data for the entire company, instead of just the direct-to-consumer division.\n\nThe change was announced by Domenic DiMeglio — who heads up marketing as well as data and insights for Paramount's streaming division — in a Thursday afternoon staff meeting, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\nKim's increased remit comes a day after Ellison, Paramount's CEO, met with company leadership in its New York offices.\n\n\"It's a wonderful opportunity for Jason — and for the team overall — to start playing a bigger role for what's happening at Paramount as we move forward,\" DiMeglio said in the meeting.\n\nDiMeglio added that Kim's bigger role is part of \"David's vision of trying to transform ourselves into being a tech-first media company — and, really, the most tech-forward media company in this space.\"\n\nEllison has remade Paramount in other ways since taking control of the company in August, including securing US UFC rights, hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News, and attempting to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhile Paramount already had data and analytics teams across the company, it now has a new point person to oversee those efforts.\n\n\"I would hope and expect that, little by little, we're going to bring those silos down,\" DiMeglio said. He added it's \"not easy work.\"\n\nDane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, said in an email to employees that \"these updates are part of a broader effort to focus our investments, reduce fragmentation, and move faster as one team.\"\n\nParamount's streaming team has become familiar with change. Last week, Paramount's streaming product and tech chief, Vibol Hou, told colleagues he was leaving at the end of January, Business Insider reported.\n\n\"You could probably sense that there's been some musical chairs stuff going on within the organization at large,\" Kim said. \"And that's not unique. That's sort of true of any company that's undergoing a large-scale organizational transformation, like the one that we're in the midst of now.\"\n\nContinuing the musical chairs analogy, Kim said that this change signals that \"this is our chair — we're here to stay.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount laid off about 1,000 employees in October, a few months after its Skydance merger closed, Kim downplayed the idea that this data and insights shake-up signals that more cuts are ahead.\n\n\"I don't think our scope is going to get smaller here. It is only going to get larger,\" Kim said. \"And I think those are all exciting tailwinds for us as a team.\"\n\nKim added that \"there might be more consolidation in the future, but that's going to be into our team.\"\n\nTwo Paramount employees in the meeting told Business Insider they were happy to hear about the change.\n\n\"It is exciting, given that we will have a lot more visibility than we used to,\" one employee on this team said.\n\nAnother staffer said this change indicates that Paramount is \"somewhat serious about the 'tech'-ification of the company.\"",

    "description": "A local news site compiled a list of over 200 businesses that have said they'll join an economic blackout day to protest ICE presence in Minnesota.",
    "fullText": "On Friday, Vanessa Beardsley is inviting her community to come hang out with cats and drink coffee at her Minnesota business, Catzen Coffee — but they won't be able to spend any money.\n\nCatzen is participating in a January 23rd economic shutdown, in which activists are calling on Minnesotans to close their businesses, not report to work or school, and refrain from shopping in protest of ICE's presence in the state.\n\nBeardsley said she \"immediately\" knew she wanted to \"stand in solidarity with our fellow businesses and our state,\" but didn't want to completely close her doors. \"We are not doing business,\" she said, \"but we will be open for people who just need a space to come and hang out.\"\n\nIt's unclear how widespread participation in the blackout will be or what impact it may have on ICE operations. Local news site Bring Me The News has compiled a running list of more than 200 businesses that have posted on social media that they will be participating. The shutdown, prompted by ICE officer Jonathan Ross's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, has been endorsed by a slew of regional labor unions, whose demands include ICE leaving the state and no additional federal funding for the agency.\n\n\"Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families,\" Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said in a statement. \"Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.\"\n\nICE didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration's immigration operations \"have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets.\"\n\n\"Making American communities safer will create an environment in which all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"ICE gets beat up by stupid people, from leadership in Minnesota,\" Donald Trump said in a speech at Davos this week. \"We actually are helping Minnesota so much, but they don't appreciate it. Most places do.\"\n\nIn addition to the larger shutdown, there's a march set to run through downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. CT. The state is expected to be under extreme cold warnings and extreme cold watch throughout the day on Friday, which might also keep Minnesotans home. Some local businesses are also opting to stay open, but planning to donate a share of — or all — of their profits to related causes.\n\n\"I understand why people are choosing to participate in the January 23 blackout, and I support those decisions,\" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement to Business Insider. \"At the same time, our small businesses, especially immigrant-owned businesses, are under a lot of pressure right now, and they could really use our support. However you choose to show up, I hope we keep our neighbors and local businesses in mind.\"",

They are also recommending that people charge all electronic communication devices in case of power outages.

    "fullText": "The lifestyles of the rich and famous often include mansions in California, penthouses in the big city, and maybe a small pied-à-terre in a foreign country. But as politics becomes an increasingly divisive topic in the United States, some more celebrities are moving out of the country — or saying that they will.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi moved to England from California in response to the 2024 election results. Rosie O'Donnell — thanks to her Irish grandparents — is in the process of becoming an Irish citizen, citing the current US political climate as her reason for moving in a TikTok video. Other celebrities like Laverne Cox and Cher have vowed to leave the States but haven't yet.\n\nThis isn't exactly a new trend. During the 2016 US presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, many stars vocally opposed Trump and threatened to leave America if he won. Now, with Trump's second term underway, celebrities are again considering relocating — not that the Trump administration is too upset.\n\n\"Good riddance!\" White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers told BI when asked for the administration's response.\n\nCelebrities aren't the only ones exploring a new place to live. Search interest for \"move abroad\" shows that peak interest occurred in November 2024. Though interest has since cooled off, it's still higher than in previous years.\n\nBureaucracy.es, an immigration services site that helps Americans moving to Spain with the visa application process, told CNN in December 2024 that it's seen over 300% more clients book consultations since the November election.\n\nHere are 10 celebrities who have moved abroad, or say they will for political reasons.\n\nOlivia Singh contributed to previous versions of this post.\n\nIn late November 2024, TheWrap reported that comedian Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, left their Montecito home for the Cotswolds, England. The publication said their move to the countryside was triggered by Trump's election and a source said they're \"never coming back.\"\n\nAn August 2025 Us cover story notes that DeGeneres told English broadcaster and host Richard Bacon during a July 20 event that she and DeGeneres were in the Cotswolds when the election results came in. \"We were like, 'We're staying here. We're not going back,'\" DeGeneres told Bacon on their reaction to Trump's victory.\n\nAccording to the Us story, DeGeneres and de Rossi have since moved from the original home they purchased in the Cotswolds and now live in a 10,000-square-foot country home called Hiaven. The pair tend to their chickens, sheep, and horses and walk to the local pub for lunch.\n\nIn a video recently posted on TikTok, Rosie O'Donnell confirmed that she moved from the US to Ireland with her youngest daughter, Dakota. The actor relocated on January 15, days before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"Although I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, that's what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child,\" O'Donnell said in the video.\n\nThe talk show host, who has Irish grandparents, said her experience so far has been \"pretty wonderful\" and she's in the process of getting Irish citizenship.\n\nO'Donnell said that she misses her four other kids and her friends, but will remain in Ireland for the time being.\n\n\"I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country,\" she said. \"And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that's when we will consider coming back.\"\n\nUK-born actor Sophie Turner moved to America after marrying singer Joe Jonas. The couple first lived together in Los Angeles and later in Miami with their two daughters Willa and Delphine. Turner and Jonas sold their Miami home in August 2023 and news of their plans to divorce broke weeks later.\n\nIn an interview with Harper's Bazaar published in October 2024, Turner said that she was homesick while living in the US and struggled with the country's politics. Turner has since moved to West London.\n\n\"The gun violence, Roe v Wade being overturned... Everything just kind of piled on,\" Turner said.\n\nAfter the 2022 Uvalde shooting, in which 19 elementary school children and two teachers were killed, Turner said she \"knew it was time\" to leave.\n\nIt was no secret that Barbra Streisand wanted Hillary Clinton to beat Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n\"He has no facts,\" Streisand told Australian \"60 Minutes\" host Michael Usher in a 2016 interview prior to the election. \"I don't know, I can't believe it. I'm either coming to your country, if you'll let me in, or Canada.\"\n\nStreisand didn't move out of the US, but she did criticize Trump in her 2018 studio album \"Walls.\"\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Stephen Colbert, Streisand said that she liked Joe Biden and thought he did a \"good job.\" When asked about the possibility of a second Trump administration, Streisand again said she'd move.\n\n\"I can't live in this country if he became president,\" she said, adding that she'd probably move to England.\n\nPer an Instagram post shared in early January amid the Los Angeles wildfires, it appears that Streisand still lives in Northern California. Reps for Streisand did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nIn November 2016, Page Six reported that Cher threatened to move if Trump was elected.\n\n\"I'm gonna have to leave the planet,\" she reportedly said at a fundraiser for Clinton.\n\nShe had a similar stance before Trump officially ran for reelection.\n\n\"I almost got an ulcer the last time,\" she told The Guardian in October 2023. \"If he gets in, who knows? This time I will leave [the country].\"\n\nHowever, as of publication, it doesn't appear that Cher has relocated. Reps for Cher did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nDays after the 2024 presidential election, \"Orange Is the New Black\" star Laverne Cox appeared on the podcast \"Just for Variety\" and spoke about the impact the results would have on the transgender community.\n\nCox said that she and some friends were considering moving, but no plans have been solidified yet.\n\n\"We're doing research on different cities in Europe and in the Caribbean,\" Cox said.\n\n\"I don't want to be in too much fear, but I'm scared,\" the actor added. \"As a public figure, with all my privilege, I'm scared, and I'm particularly scared because I'm a public figure. I feel like I could be targeted.\"\n\nAt the 2016 Matrix Awards, \"Girls\" actor Lena Dunham said that she was serious about moving if Trump won the election.\n\n\"I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will,\" Dunham said. \"I know a lovely place in Vancouver and I can get my work done from there.\"\n\nBut after the election results, Dunham changed her mind.\n\n\"I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and live and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right,\" she wrote in part in a note shared on Instagram.\n\n\"It's easy to joke about moving to Canada,\" she added. \"It's harder to see, and to love, the people who fill your mailbox with hate. It's harder to see what needs to be done and do it. It's harder to live, fully and painfully aware of the injustice surrounding us, to cherish and fear your country all at once. But I'm willing to try. Will you try with me?\"\n\nDunham did eventually leave her home in New York and moved to London. However, in an interview with the New Yorker published in July 2024, the actor said the move was prompted by work opportunities.\n\nRobin Wright, known for her roles in \"Forrest Gump\" and \"House of Cards,\" relocated to England for work and decided to make the move permanent.\n\nWright spends most of her time in the Chiltern Hills, a rural part of England about 44 miles outside London, and enjoys the peace and quiet it offers compared to her former home of Los Angeles.\n\n\"They're living,\" Wright told UK publication The Sunday Times in August. \"They're not in the car in traffic, panicked on a phone call, eating a sandwich. That's most of America. Everything's rush, competition and speed.\"\n\nWright mentioned during an appearance on The View that the UK's tax breaks make it advantageous for production, which is why she relocated there in the first place, but she's enjoyed her break from the US.\n\n\"I'm troubled, like many of us are, about this state of our country,\" Wright said. \"It's not the reason, I just — I'm so tranquil over there.\"\n\n\"Pretty Woman\" star Richard Gere and his wife Alejandra Silva sold their house in Connecticut for $10.75 million in November 2024 and moved to Spain.\n\nGere said the plan was to be closer to Silva's family in Spain, but on his way out of the country, he had some choice words about the US.\n\n\"We're in a very dark place in America where we have a bully and a thug who's the president of the United States,\" Gere said during a speech at Spain's Goya Awards in February.\n\nSilva told The Daily Mail that the move was not permanent, and that they plan on going back and forth between Spain and the US.\n\n\"We're always coming back,\" she said. We'll come back here in the summer because we have the kids at camp. We just have to balance our lives there and here.\"\n\nThe billionaire filmmaker has been visiting New Zealand since the 1990s, but he set roots there once the pandemic hit in 2020.\n\nSince then, Cameron has had another reason for staying.\n\n\"I'm not there for the scenery, I'm there for the sanity,\" he said in a January 2026 episode of \"In Depth with Graham Bensinger.\"\n\nAlong with supporting how New Zealanders handled the pandemic, Cameron has also voiced his opposition to Donald Trump. That led to Camera not just living there, but also making all his \"Avatar\" movies in the country. He became a citizen of New Zealand in 2025.\n\n\"I think it's horrifying,\" he told the New Zealand outlet Stuff in 2025 about Trump's reelection. \"I see it as a turn away from everything decent. America doesn't stand for anything if it doesn't stand for what it has historically stood for. It becomes a hollow idea, and I think they're hollowing it out as fast as they can for their own benefit.\"",

    "title": "10 Google Search Hacks Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "These tips can help you get better search results.",
    "fullText": "It's not just you. Google Search has become significantly worse in recent years. In the past, you only had to watch out for low-quality content filled with SEO-bait keywords. Today, you have to be wary of AI-generated garbage, misinformation, and a generally worse UI. Still, it's not impossible to find good search results on Google. I've found a number of tricks that have helped me reduce the number of low-quality entries Google returns for my searches. Here are 10 such tips everyone should know about before their next search:\n\nI'm still annoyed by Google's decision to slap AI right at the top of search results, and I make it a point to get rid of it every time I use a new browser or a new device. Doing this is much harder if you're using the Google Search app, so stick to web browsers if you want to rid yourself of AI results. To that end, there are actually a few easy ways to remove AI from Google's results. The quickest is to add -ai to your search queries and Google will remove AI results. Alternatively, you can try using the Hide Gemini browser extension.\n\nGoogle's best days were when it showed a simple page with 10 blue links the moment you searched for anything. If you want to return to that simplicity, you can use the Web search filter in Google. Once you search for something on Google, click the More button below the search bar up top, and select Web. This will remove all the clutter from Google Search and return 10 webpages at a time. If you use Chrome, you can simply type \"web\" in the address bar to start a Web search.\n\nI've also written about a browser extension called Lucky, which does the same thing in Safari for iPhone. Lucky is available at a one-time fee of $3, and, in my opinion, it's well worth the price.\n\nIf you know the domain you want to visit, you can limit your search to that domain alone. For example, you could restrict results to .gov if you only want to look at official US government sites, or .fr if you only wish to search websites registered in France. Just add site:.gov (or any other domain of your choice) to your search queries, and you'll find better results that way. It's also useful if you want to restrict searches to .ac.uk or .edu sites, which are more education-focused.\n\nIf you've found a trusted source that you like, such as Lifehacker, you can use Google to restrict your results only to that website. You can add site:lifehacker.com to your queries on Google, and it'll only show you results from this website. Just replace the name of the site with whichever one you like. This method is often better than using that site's internal search tools, too.\n\nWhen you're looking for specific information, you may be better off searching for a particular file format. For instance, if you're looking for scientific articles, you may have a better chance of finding a pdf file than a web result. In these cases, you can use the filetype:pdf filter to locate pdf files, and you can replace the file type to locate results in a different file format.\n\nIf you're finding significantly worse results using Google search, you can try to refine the results by using Google's built-in filters. Just below the search bar, you'll see a few tabs such as All, News, More, Tools, etc. Click through each of these to eliminate certain types of results. Specifically, the Tools tab lets you refine results by date, and even allows you to remove results for related search terms and focus only on exact matches.\n\nSometimes, basic Google search tools just aren't good enough to find what you need. This is particularly true when your search terms include words that are popular for other reasons. For instance, you're searching \"president,\" but not the president of your country. This is where advanced search could help you remove unwanted results. You can go to the Google Advanced Search page and use all the filters there to find what you need. Each filter has a helpful description right next to it, which makes it easy to figure out what you're doing.\n\nGoogle also allows you to upload files and images to find results. Open Google search and click the + button in the search bar to upload a file or an image. You can attach a query to the image, and Google will help answer that question, or you can even look for images similar to the one you've uploaded. This can be useful if you want to detect fake profiles online, as scammers often steal profile photos from others to create a fake identity.\n\nIf you can't always be bothered with using various manual methods to hide all the junk from your Google Search results, consider using a content blocker to do so. My favorite has long been uBlock Origin, which is available on desktop and on mobile. It'll remove all sponsored results, unwanted product listings, and most types of junk from your Google results.\n\nIf you really like and trust certain websites, you should add those as preferred sources on Google. This will ensure that results from those sites are highlighted among search results and the Top Stories section in your search results. Google rolled this feature out in 2025, and it's the most effective way to find information from higher quality websites. If you'd like, you can click this link to add Lifehacker as a preferred source.",

    "title": "Where to Stream Every Nominated Movie Before the 2026 Oscars",
    "description": "Prepare for Hollywood's big night by watching everything you can before the ceremony on March 15.",
    "fullText": "It's Oscar season! By which I mean, it's that time of year when movie dorks are in a rush to catch up on as many Oscar-nominated films as is feasible before the awards ceremony kicks off—which, this year, will be on March 15 on ABC. If box office and streaming numbers are any indication, there's a good chance you've seen this year's nominations front-runner, Sinners, which didn't just receive the most nominations in 2026, but received the most nominations ever (can't say I'm mad about it), but the second-most nominated movie of the year, Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, is also readily available.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't yet easily stream major nominees like Marty Supreme, Hamnet, and The Secret Agent, which are still making the rounds in theaters. It's also too early to stream the likes of Sirât, The Voice of Hind Rajab, Kohuko, Viva Verdi!, Arco, Zootopia 2, and Avatar: Fire and Ash, though there's a good chance that will change before the first envelopes are torn open. I'll continue to update this article as more movies drop on digital platforms. Unless your a hardcore cinema-goer, you should have plenty to occupy your eyeballs until then.\n\n16 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actor (Michael B. Jordan), Supporting Actor (Delroy Lindo), Actress (Wunmi Mosako), Directing (Ryan Coogler), Original Screenplay, Original Song (\"I Lied to You\"), Original Score, Casting, Cinematography, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Costume Design, Production Design, Sound, Visual Effects\n\nRyan Coogler's Sinners didn't just do pretty well with the nominations—it did historically well. The previous record has stood at 14 since 1950, when All About Eve deservedly won the night. Titanic and La La Land matched that number, but it's never been beaten until now (the addition of the new Best Casting category helping matters just a bit). Nominations aren't trophies—La La Land didn't wind up winning the actual Best Picture prize—but it's still a notable achievement.\n\nIt's also an Oscar rarity in another sense: Sinners is one of a very small handful of horror movies to be nominated for Best Picture and may well be only the second (after Silence of the Lambs) to win. Stream Sinners on HBO Max and Prime Video.\n\n13 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), Supporting Actor (Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn), Supporting Actress (Teyana Taylor), Director (Paul Thomas Anderson), Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Editing, Original Score, Production Design, Sound, Casting\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson, you will always be famous where Oscar is concerned. The director's dark comedy/action thriller earned a very impressive 13 nominations, including a Best Actor nod for Leonardo DiCaprio and supporting nominations for Teyana Taylor and Benicio Del Toro. Stream one Battle After Another on HBO Max.\n\n9 Nominations for: Best Picture, Supporting Actor (Jacob Elordi), Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Costume Design, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score, Production Design, Sound\n\nPerpetual Oscar fave Guillermo del Toro's long-gestating Frankenstein adaptation finally made it to theaters (albeit briefly—it's mostly a Netflix thing) this year, and the result was worth the wait. Sumptuous and appropriately horrifying, the director did Mary Shelley proud, and the film earned a very respectable nine nominations along the way. The all-time number of Frankenstein movies runs into the hundreds, but I'm pretty sure that this is the first one to get any significant Oscar love. Stream Frankenstein on Netflix.\n\n9 nominations for: Best Picture, Actress (Renate Reinsve), Supporting Actor (Stellan Skarsgård), Supporting Actress (Elle Fanning), Supporting Actress (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), Director (Joachim Trier), Original Screenplay, International Film, Editing\n\nThis Norwegian import from director Joachim Trier (The Worst Person in the World, which also starred Best Actress nominee Renate Reinsve) managed to pick up nominations in both the International Film and overall Best Picture categories. It's probably a long shot for the latter, but has a solid shot at the former. (Between this and Predator: Badlands, Elle Fanning had a great 2025.) Rent Sentimental Value from Prime Video.\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actress (Emma Stone), Adapted Screenplay, Original Score\n\nThis is the fifth Yorgos Lanthimos film to receive Oscar nominations in major categories, and the third that's up for Best Picture, following Poor Things a few years back, but the acclaimed, idiosyncratic director has yet to claim a trophy of his own. Stream Bugonia on Peacock.\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Editing, Sound, Visual Effects\n\nHeeeey it's that Apple movie that I saw a million ads for (Brad Pitt: The Movie\") that's apparently pretty good? I don't know, I'm not a car guy. But director Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick) sure knows how to film things going fast. Stream F1: The Movie on Apple TV+\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Original Song (\"Train Dreams\")\n\nClint Bentley's historical drama is slow, absolutely, but in a modern cinema landscape of constant distraction and over-explanation, its contemplative beauty feels revolutionary. Stream Train Dreams on Netflix.\n\n2 Nominations for: Original Song (\"Golden\"), Animated Film\n\nI'd have put this one up for the overall Best Picture trophy as well, but that's just me. Pure joy, and very likely to take home both of these awards (if \"Golden\" loses Best Original Song, the pre-teen set is likely to riot). Stream KPop Demon Hunters on Netflix.\n\n2 Nominations for: Actor (Ethan Hawke), Original Screenplay\n\nBesties Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke reunited to tell the story of Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart on the opening night of Oklahoma!. It sounds like a real niche movie, but it is well worth seeking out—Hawke is definitely a stealth contender for Best Actor. Rent Blue Moon from Prime Video.\n\n2 Nominations for: Original Screenplay, International Film\n\nA group of Iranian political prisoners, now free, must decide whether and in what way to take revenge in this film, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes last year but missed out on a Best Picture nomination. Rent It Was Just an Accident from Prime Video.\n\nNomination for: Actress (Rose Byrne)\n\nRose Byrne picks up a nomination for her role as a mother who's going through it. (I've heard this one called \"the Uncut Gems of parenting movies.\") Rent If I Had Legs I'd Kick You from Prime Video.\n\nNomination for: Supporting Actress (Amy Madigan)\n\nWas there any more memorable screen presence in 2025 than Aunt Gladys? No, there was not—even before that scene where...what happened to her...happened. Stream Weapons on HBO Max.\n\nThis might not be Pixar's best-reviewed film, but the story of a kid who becomes an inadvertent alien ambassador is pretty darn charming, nonetheless. Stream Elio on Disney+.\n\nNomination for: Actress (Kate Hudson)\n\nThe premise, dealing with the real-life, occasionally tragic story of a Neil Diamond tribute band, sounds like something I made up.

    "title": "Six Ways to Use Staging Psychology to Sell Your House",
    "description": "Staging a house isn’t just making it look clean and neat—it’s about manipulating folks to see themselves in the space.",
    "fullText": "Selling a house is one of the largest transactions most of us will ever make. Considering how much you’ve invested in the place in terms of both money and sweat equity, it’s natural to want to get as much profit from the sale as possible. One strategy to maximize profits that most real estate professionals will recommend is staging: temporarily dressing, furnishing, and arranging the home to make it as appealing as possible.\n\nStaging works—it’s been shown to speed up the time to sale and to increase the sale price of a house. But it’s not magic—there’s a specific psychology to staging a house that you have to keep in mind, especially if you’re choosing to do it yourself in order to save a few bucks. It might seem like all you need to do is freshen the paint, clean the place up, and make a few furnishing choices, but if you want to get the most bang for your staging buck, you should keep staging psychology in mind.\n\nThe first thing to know about house staging psychology is the fundamental purpose of staging: It’s not to make the house look clean or presentable—it’s to shape a narrative. Essentially, you’re telling prospective buyers how they could live in your home. From where they’ll have their morning coffee to where they’ll entertain, you want to help them imagine what life will be like in the house. The easier you make it for people to see themselves living their ideal life there, the easier it will be to close the sale.\n\nIn order to support that narrative, there are specific psychological levers you’ll be pulling as you stage.\n\nFirst impressions really do matter, and the first staging psychology lever you’ll pull is what’s known as the “primacy effect.” This is a common cognitive bias wherein the first impression we get of something influences our perceptions in an outsized way. In other words, if the first impression people get from your home is that it’s luxurious and comfortable, this will override any negative impressions they get later in the house tour.\n\nStaging itself helps with this, of course, but you should also focus on the curb appeal and the entryway of the house to really cement that first impression as positive. Then, consider the fact that each room or space within the house will also offer its own first impression—that’s why decluttering is so vital. Clearing out your stuff and leaving behind a clean, curated visual will let potential buyers see a house they can easily move into, instead of getting an impression that they’d be buying a lot of chores.\n\nThe next bit of staging psychology you need to implement is anchoring—you want buyers to see the house as valuable right away so that impression gets anchored in their heads. This is why staged homes tend to sell for higher prices.\n\nThis involves staging with expensive-looking furniture, if you can, and decorating in a luxe way that implies high value. Seeing high-end decor, smart technology, and other expensive features cements in people’s minds that this is a high-value house, and they will be more willing to pay a premium for it because of that perceived value. Anchoring this value also lets you use the next bit of staging psychology—the Halo Effect.\n\nThe Halo Effect is a cognitive bias where a positive impression prevents you from seeing the flaws or downsides. If your property is a bit old or needs some work, staging it with a fresh, luxe look not only anchors a higher value in buyer’s minds, it can actually cause them to overlook those flaws. Even if they’re aware of some of the problems on one level, the overall sense of value and comfort is what will drive their decision-making.\n\nIt’s important to note that you shouldn’t try to conceal problems or needed upgrades; that would be unethical. The goal here is to let the staging drive a potential buyer’s enthusiasm so they willingly overlook those problems in favor of the comfortable, high-value narrative you’ve constructed.\n\nA key aspect of staging is triggering an emotional response in folks touring your house. Your goal is to make them imagine living there, and to make that fantasy one they associate with positive emotions. To do that, you’ll engage their senses:\n\nLighting. Soft lighting and a focus on natural light creates a warm, inviting atmosphere.\n\nScent. A house that smells fresh and clean is a comfortable space that doesn’t hint at a lot of work to be done. (Pro tip: Get someone who doesn’t live there to sniff the place out; we often become nose-blind to how our house smells.) You can also try to trigger a sense of nostalgia with the tried-and-true trick of baking some cookies. Don’t go overboard—an entire can of air freshener, a house that smells overwhelmingly of cookies, or a house that smells like you just cleaned it using buckets of bleach can backfire. Subtlety is key.\n\nAspiration. We all know there’s the way we think we’re going to live our lives, and then there’s reality. You want to offer potential buyers the fantasy. Maybe you don’t spend time cozied up in a reading nook with a good book and a cup of tea, for example, but you wish you did—so create that reading nook for buyers to picture themselves in. Their emotional attachment to the idea will make them more positive about the house overall.\n\nWhen staging a house, an easy psychological approach is to group things—furniture, decorations, lighting, even color palettes—using the Rule of Three. This is exactly what it sounds like: Arranging things in subtle groups of odd numbers (typically three) and arranging them to have some height and texture variety. The psychological effect is that this is perceived as more natural and less “stagey” than even numbers, and odd numbers tickle the brain’s need for symmetry, so people will be more engaged with your house.\n\nFinally, you want to make a buyer’s path to imagining themselves living in your clean, fresh, artfully decorated home as easy as possible—so get rid of yourself. Decluttering and depersonalizing doesn’t mean bare walls and empty rooms, it means going neutral with your decor and artwork. Get rid of the hobbies, the personal collections, and that weird lamp everyone else hates. Leaving some personal touches, like a few tasteful photos of the family, is a good idea—you don’t want the house to feel like a hotel. But you also don’t want people to feel like they’re intruding, or like they’re picking their way through your dirty laundry.",

    "title": "Here's How Long It Really Takes to Form a New Habit",
    "description": "It's not 21 days, or even 66 days, no matter what the life hack industrial complex wants you to think.",
    "fullText": "Forming a habit is a powerful tool. You work the new thing into your daily routine, and soon enough, it becomes automatic. That's the dream, anyway—in reality, you have to work at it. But how long does it take to fully form a habit? Despite what you may have heard, it’s not necessarily just 21 days.\n\nThe number of days it takes to form a new habit depends on the habit, on you, and on what strategies you’re using to build and maintain that habit. Scientific estimates have ranged from as little as 21 days, to eight months or more. Let’s look at why that range is so big, and what you can do to build habits faster.\n\nThe idea that a habit takes 21 days to form came from a surgeon, Maxwell Maltz. He observed that it seemed to take about three weeks for a person to get used to their new body after an operation like amputation or plastic surgery, James Clear writes. (Having gone through a few minor surgeries, I recall that it takes between two and three weeks for pain and swelling to subside enough that you aren’t constantly thinking about the fact you just had surgery; I have to wonder if that’s related.)\n\nThe surgeon’s idea was that it takes 21 days for people to dissolve and re-form a “mental image” of themselves. This isn’t backed by research; it’s just one guy’s gut feeling. But I think it stuck because it fits a lot of our experiences.\n\nLet’s say you want to get up early to exercise first thing in the morning. Well, of course you can do it once. But how do you make it a habit? When I was in that situation—becoming a morning exerciser despite not being a morning person—I made myself commit for a full week before I even allowed myself to complain about it or adjust my plan. I had to be up at 6 a.m. every day, five days in a row, non-negotiable. I enjoyed having a break on the weekend, and then the second week was much easier. By the end of the third, this really was my new normal. I kept it up for at least a year after that.\n\nEven though the 21-day rule isn’t based on science, it’s a good timeframe for a “trial run” of a new habit. After all, one day can be a fluke. One or two weeks is a timeframe we’ve been through before, and we can ride out a disruption to our normal life that long (imagine a vacation, or a week’s crunch time before a work deadline). But by the time you get to three weeks, or better yet, a full month, you’ve learned some things about your new habit and how it fits into your life. Even the simplest habits are never actually simple; you need to learn and practice a bunch of mini-skills in the process of building almost any habit.\n\nSo, by that 21-day mark, you’ve done the thing a bunch of times. Importantly, you’ve likely weathered a few interruptions or obstacles (like the weekend) and gotten back on track. It’s probably a good rule of thumb for a timeframe that is long enough to feel like “real life.” But that doesn’t mean it’s enough.\n\nScientific research has attempted to measure how long it takes for a habit to truly become automatic. For example, this study asked participants to choose a habit and to attach it to something they did once a day (for example, “eat a piece of fruit with lunch”). The study lasted 12 weeks. Some of the participants felt their new habit was automatic after just a few weeks; many others weren’t there yet at the end of the study. The researchers concluded that most people would form an automatic habit anywhere between two and eight months...according to a model that they calculated would only apply to 62 (about 75%) of the participants.\n\nThat’s a wide range, and we don’t know whether the rest of the people would have ever gotten to a point where the habit was automatic. The researchers also found that simpler habits (like drinking water) were quicker to become automatic than harder or more complex ones (like doing 50 sit-ups).\n\nA 2012 review looked at several other estimates and concluded that it would make more sense to tell people to expect at least 10 weeks for their new habit to become automatic, but also that it helps a lot just to know that any habit keeps getting easier the longer you do it. Those authors point out that expecting a habit to form in 21 days can make people discouraged, and instead it’s better to focus on the payoff of “working effortfully on a new behavior for 2-3 months.”\n\nSetting time-based commitments can be a helpful tool, like getting through the first week before changing the plan, or using your new moisturizer every day until the bottle is empty. But another school of thought holds that long-term behavior change is better described by “stages of change” than by calendar dates. There is a \"contemplation\" stage where you're thinking about how you'll do the new behavior, and a \"preparation stage\" where you're gathering supplies and testing the waters—say, buying new running shoes, or taking one fitness class to see how you like it.\n\nIn some cases, a habit takes longer to form than you hope. But you may be able to get a habit to stick sooner than expected if you are intentional about the way you form the habit. Working consciously on your new habit can make it last longer, too, as we see in the maintenance stage.\n\nYour initial habit-forming period—whether you want to think of it as 21 days, or 66 days, or, heck, eight months—is what behavior change psychologists call the action stage. You’ve begun the habit, but it’s not automatic yet and you might not be convinced that you’re really going to continue. In this stage, you can make your habit more likely to stick by doing the following:\n\nRemind yourself of your motivation to do it. For example, stick your reminder card for your next dentist’s appointment on your bathroom mirror, so that you remember not just that you should floss your teeth, but also why you want to floss your teeth.\n\nRestructure your environment to give you cues and support. For example, if you want to run every morning, set your shoes out the night before and have your spouse ask you how your run went when you return.\n\nBuild self-efficacy by celebrating your small wins. This could mean checking off the days you did the thing on a calendar, but it could also involve working toward milestones (like total number of miles run) or making benchmarks of your progress (maybe you used to do your daily pushups with your hands on a chair, but now you can do them on the floor).\n\nPlan ahead for how you’ll maintain your habit even when you’re interrupted (more about that in a minute).\n\nOnce you’ve built some momentum, you’re in the maintenance stage. You’re doing the habit, and maybe it’s starting to feel automatic, or at least more of a part of your life than it used to be. In this stage, you may need to do some things like the following:\n\nReevaluate your plan. Is running every day still working for you? Maybe it makes more sense to make some of the runs longer and designate other days for rest, yoga, or strength training.\n\nThink ahead to obstacles you might face. If you go on a vacation, will you continue the habit? If you end up falling off the wagon for whatever reason, how will you get back on?\n\nMake sure your motivation is something that will continue to work for you. For example, if you found it really motivating to keep up a streak on the calendar, the real test will come when you inevitably break your streak. At that point, there needs to be something other than the streak that is keeping you at it. This is often something intrinsic: You like being the person who flosses every day. You’re excited to You’re happy that your cholesterol is down from the way you’ve been eating.\n\nBuilding a habit is not a matter of white-knuckling it until you hit a magic number of days. It’s a process that takes effort the whole time, even when you’re five years in. Habits are work, but the ones that last are the ones where the work feels worthwhile.",

    "fullText": "Tech companies are getting increasingly pushy with their large language models—prominent buttons for these AI features coat every surface designers can think of, including in three of the most prominent browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.\n\nIf you want these AI features to go away, and stay away, there's a script for that. JustTheBrowser is a free and open source tool from developer and tech blogger Corbin Davenport that removes AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Basically, you can run this once and never think about these features again.\n\nTo get started, head to the JustTheBrowser homepage. There are scripts to copy (which I'm not going to include here in case they change in the future).\n\nWindows users will need to run PowerShell as an admin—the easiest way to do that is by right-clicking PowerShell in the start menu and clicking \"Run as administrator.\" There is a different script for Mac and Linux users—that one just needs to be copied into a regular Terminal.\n\nEither way, you will be asked which browser you'd like to update the settings for—just hit the number corresponding to what you want to do.\n\nIn my testing, the process was very simple on Windows—just click the number and the script will do its thing. On macOS, I needed to follow a few instructions to enable a configuration policy in the Settings app, something that only took a couple of clicks. After that, Chrome was free of any and all references to AI.\n\nA number of other features were also gone, including those annoying prompts to switch my default browser.\n\nThe way this works is kind of interesting: it uses features intended for large organizations. Basically all major browsers allow for group settings, which is how IT departments control what you can and can't do with your browser. Among these settings are ones to disable AI features.\n\nIt's an interesting workaround, and hopefully one that keeps working. There is always a chance that browser companies make it so even IT departments can't disable AI features, at which point we'll all need to find a new solution (or switch to an alternative browser).",

    "title": "A Study Found Diet Coke Is Better for You Than Water (Sort Of)",
    "description": "I won’t say it’s “healthier,” but it certainly doesn’t seem to be any worse.",
    "fullText": "I’m sure you’ve seen the studies that come out from time to time showing that diet sodas are arguably kinda-sorta bad for you. (Their evidence is never very strong.) But did you see the new study that found diet soda was better than water for people with type 2 diabetes? Not only is it a real study, it was well-designed and we should be paying attention to it, according to an epidemiologist I talked to who was not involved in the study.\n\nThat epidemiologist is Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz of the University of Wollongong, who wrote about it here. When I asked him if it was a good or a bad thing that this study had mostly escaped notice by news media, he said “this is far more robust than most of the science that gets media coverage.” The study was not sponsored by any commercial drink company.\n\nIn the delightfully named SODAS trial (Study Of Drinks with Artificial Sweeteners), researchers at the University of California, Irvine, and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, recruited adults who had type 2 diabetes and who had a habit of drinking artificially sweetened beverages (including, but not limited to, my one true love Diet Coke). The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nHalf of them were asked to switch to drinking water instead, and everyone was provided with three servings a day of either their diet drink of choice, or a water of their choice (unsweetened seltzer included). The study ran for 24 weeks. There were 181 people enrolled, of which 179 finished the study, which is considered a fairly large group for a study of this type. (It's twice as large as an older study I'll contrast it with below.)\n\nThe main outcome the researchers studied was hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) as measured by a blood test. This is a common test used to monitor glucose control in people who have diabetes or are at risk for it. The higher your HbA1C, the higher your blood glucose has probably been over the past three months or so.\n\nThe results: HbA1C got slightly better in the group that was drinking artificial sweeteners: from 7.19% to 7.14%. It got worse in the group that was drinking water, from 7.20% to 7.44%.\n\nThe researchers collected a few other metrics, for good measure. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and “time in range” as measured by a continuous glucose monitor all favored the diet drinks group. The people in the diet drinks group lost a little bit of weight (on average, two pounds) while those in the water group had stable weights. The researchers referred to this difference in weight loss as “statistically significant, but not clinically significant.” In other words, probably real, but too small to matter.\n\nBottom line: there was no real benefit to the people in the study switching from diet sodas to water; if anything, doing so may have slightly hurt their health.\n\nOK, maybe I mean me and my Diet Coke habit. I fully admit to being biased here, but in an educated way. I like my Diet Coke. I’ve also been keeping an eye on research about artificial sweeteners over the years, and while I won’t necessarily defend my soda as health food, nothing has ever convinced me that it’s bad for me. (Sugar-sweetened sodas are a different story; those, we should probably all avoid.)\n\nNow, we have a reasonably large, well-designed, independently-funded study showing that artificially sweetened drinks are possibly better for you than water. I still haven’t seen any news coverage of it, even though a study with the opposite results got coverage a few years back. That study involved 81 women with diabetes in a weight-loss trial, and their HbA1C improved slightly with water compared to diet drinks. Even so, one expert that Everyday Health spoke to about it said that he was “of the opinion that the health risks of diet sodas are overstated.” (Meanwhile, the authors of the most recent study point out that comparing that study to theirs isn’t quite apples-to-apples, since it was a weight loss trial and this one is not.)\n\nThat’s an important point to remember about any study on a specific food: they usually apply to a specific medical condition or population. We like to file them away in our mind as “Diet Coke good” or “Diet Coke bad,” but each study only gives us a piece of the puzzle, not a generality. For example this study tells us nothing about Diet Coke’s effects on people who have poorly controlled diabetes, or who don’t have diabetes at all; and it doesn’t say anything about measures other than those related to blood sugar. It didn’t even specifically study Diet Coke, although it’s likely that Diet Coke was one of the more popular beverages participants chose.\n\nTo be clear, it is entirely possible that this isn’t a real effect, and and that water and diet drinks are basically equivalent when it comes to your blood glucose and your health. Meyerowitz-Katz says this is probably the most likely explanation, but we can’t rule out the possibility that diet sodas may help glucose control in type 2 diabetes. Maybe they satisfy a sweet tooth and help people avoid other sugary snacks, for example.\n\nThe researchers write that their main takeaway is that “maintaining usual [artificially-sweetened beverage] intake may be a tool to continue to help manage T2D if glycemic measures are controlled and stable.” Meyerowitz-Katz agrees: “At worst, there is no difference between diet soft drinks and water when it comes to diabetes control. At best, the diet drinks might be sightly better.”",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Greenland's ownership was not Russia's concern and that the United States and Denmark - whose historical treatment ​of the island he criticised - should sort the matter out between themselves.\n\nMoscow has watched ‌with glee as U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to acquire Greenland has widened Washington's split with Europe, even though his moves ‌could have ramifications for Russia, which already has a strong Arctic presence.\n\nSpeaking in Davos, Trump on Wednesday stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland and ruled out the use of force. He suggested progress towards a deal to end a dispute over the semi-autonomous Danish territory that risked ⁠the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations ‌in decades.\n\nPutin, addressing the matter for the first time in public, signalled that Russia would not object to Trump's push to control Greenland, which he speculated ‍may be worth nearly $1 billion.\n\n\"What happens in Greenland is of no concern to us whatsoever,\" Putin told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.\n\n\"Incidentally, Denmark has always treated Greenland as a colony and has been quite harsh, if not ​cruel, towards it. But that is a different matter altogether, and hardly anyone is interested ‌in it now,\" Putin added.\n\nDenmark's financial and military support for Ukraine has angered Russia, which is fighting to take full control of four Ukrainian regions it claimed as its own in 2022.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry has bridled at Trump's suggestion that Moscow has ambitions on Greenland too, but has been careful not to criticise Trump - who is trying to broker a deal to end the ⁠war in Ukraine - and has hinted it has some sympathy ​for his claim.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that ​the giant resource-rich island, which already has a U.S. military presence, was not \"a natural part\" of Denmark.\n\nPutin recalled that Russia in 1867 sold Alaska to the United ‍States for $7.2 million, and that ⁠Denmark in 1917 sold the Virgin Islands to Washington, setting precedents for such land transactions.\n\nUsing the Alaska price - adjusted for inflation and accounting for the larger size of Greenland and ⁠changes in gold prices, Putin said buying Greenland from Denmark could cost around $1 billion, which he said he thought Washington ‌could afford.\n\n\"I think they will sort it out between themselves,\" said Putin.",

    "description": "These annoying habits are actually a sign of high intelligence.",
    "fullText": "You’ve probably been told you’re “too intense,” “overly analytical,” or “kind of a lot.” Maybe people joke that you’re exhausting, picky, or difficult, even when you’re just being yourself. What often gets labeled as annoying behavior is sometimes just intelligence operating at a different speed or depth than the people around you. If any of these habits sound familiar, it might not be a personality flaw—it might be how your brain actually works.\n\nYou don’t accept surface-level explanations easily, and you’re rarely satisfied with a quick answer. When something doesn’t make sense, you want context, reasoning, and follow-up details. To other people, this can feel like interrogation or nitpicking. To you, it’s basic curiosity and clarity.\n\nCognitive psychology research shows that highly intelligent people are more likely to engage in exploratory questioning because their brains are wired to detect gaps in logic. You’re not trying to challenge authority or slow things down. You’re trying to understand how the system actually works. That depth-first thinking can be uncomfortable for people who prefer shortcuts.\n\nYou replay conversations, decisions, and possibilities long after others have moved on. What looks like anxiety or indecision is often your brain running complex simulations. You’re not stuck—you’re processing. Your mind wants to anticipate outcomes before committing.\n\nStudies on high cognitive ability show that intelligent people engage in more counterfactual thinking, meaning they mentally test multiple scenarios. This helps with long-term decision-making but can look exhausting from the outside. Your brain is doing heavy lifting, even when you’re sitting still. Silence doesn’t mean inactivity.\n\nSmall talk drains you faster than physical work, and repetitive tasks feel unbearable. When there’s nothing mentally stimulating happening, your attention starts wandering immediately. People may think you’re disengaged or rude. In reality, your brain is underfed.\n\nNeuroscience research links boredom sensitivity to higher baseline cognitive processing needs. Your mind requires novelty, complexity, or challenge to stay regulated. When the environment doesn’t provide that, you disconnect. It’s not arrogance—it’s a neurological mismatch.\n\nYou often finish people’s sentences or jump ahead in conversations. This can come across as impatience or dominance. What’s actually happening is that your brain recognized the pattern early. You already see where the thought is going.\n\nHighly intelligent individuals tend to process information faster, especially in familiar domains. Waiting for others to arrive at the same conclusion can feel painfully slow. You’re not trying to steal the spotlight—you’re struggling with pacing differences. Conversation speed isn’t universal.\n\nStep-by-step directions feel irritating when you already understand the underlying concept. You want to know why something works, not just how to follow it. Being told exactly what to do can feel restrictive rather than helpful. Others may interpret this as defiance.\n\nResearch on problem-solving styles shows that intelligent thinkers prefer principle-based learning over rote instruction. You want autonomy, not micromanagement. When systems feel inefficient, your brain pushes back. Compliance without understanding doesn’t feel logical to you.\n\nInaccuracies bother you more than they bother others. When someone states something incorrectly, it feels unresolved until it’s corrected. You’re not trying to embarrass anyone. Your brain wants alignment with reality.\n\nPsychological studies on truth-bias sensitivity show that intelligent individuals experience stronger discomfort with factual inconsistency. Letting errors slide feels mentally itchy. You value accuracy because it protects understanding. Silence can feel dishonest.\n\nYou enjoy solitude not because you dislike people, but because your brain needs space to process. Constant interaction can feel overstimulating. Alone time isn’t loneliness—it’s recovery. Others may see this as antisocial.\n\nResearch on intelligence and introversion shows a strong correlation between high cognitive capacity and lower social stimulation needs. Your mind is already busy. Quiet gives it room to stretch. That preference is regulation, not withdrawal.\n\nWasted time, unnecessary meetings, and roundabout processes irritate you deeply. You see faster, cleaner ways to do things and struggle when systems ignore them. This can make you seem impatient or controlling. Internally, you’re optimizing.\n\nHigh-level problem solvers naturally scan for efficiency gaps. Your frustration comes from seeing potential improvements that aren’t being used. You’re not nitpicking—you’re noticing friction. Efficiency feels calming to your nervous system.\n\nWhen something captures your attention, you go all in. You read everything, watch everything, and think about it constantly—until you don’t. Then you move on just as intensely. Others may think you’re flaky.\n\nThis pattern aligns with intellectual curiosity cycles rather than a lack of commitment. Research on polymathic thinkers shows that deep but temporary immersion is common. You’re collecting frameworks, not hobbies. Each interest feeds the next.\n\nBackground noise that others ignore can completely derail your focus. You notice overlapping sounds, visual clutter, and interruptions immediately. People may accuse you of being dramatic. Your brain is just highly responsive.\n\nSensory processing research shows that intelligent individuals often have heightened perceptual sensitivity. More information is coming in at once. Managing input becomes essential for thinking clearly. Distraction isn’t minor when your processing load is high.\n\nYou don’t automatically accept “that’s just how it’s done.” Rules, traditions, and expectations feel optional if they don’t make sense. This can come across as rebellious or difficult. For you, it’s logical consistency.\n\nIntelligent thinkers are more likely to evaluate norms through reason rather than conformity. You’re not trying to disrupt for fun. You’re checking whether the rule still serves a purpose. Compliance without rationale feels irrational.\n\nYou value clarity over cushioning, especially when discussing ideas. Emotional padding sometimes feels unnecessary or misleading. Others may interpret your directness as harsh. You’re aiming for precision.\n\nLinguistic studies show that intelligent communicators prioritize information density over emotional framing. Your intent isn’t cruelty—it’s accuracy. Tone mismatches often come from differing communication priorities. Meaning gets lost in translation.\n\nConversations that stay superficial for too long drain you. You crave depth, nuance, and big-picture thinking. When discussions never go there, you disengage. Others may see this as arrogance.\n\nIntellectual stimulation is a basic need for you, not a luxury. Research on cognitive engagement shows that intelligent individuals require complexity to stay emotionally invested. Without it, boredom sets in fast. Depth keeps you present.\n\nYou feel things deeply, even when you understand them logically. Your emotional reactions don’t cancel out your intelligence—they coexist with it. This intensity can surprise people who expect smart individuals to be detached. You’re anything but.\n\nPsychological research increasingly links high intelligence with emotional depth rather than emotional distance. You process feelings with the same complexity as ideas. That depth can be overwhelming to others. It’s not instability—it’s capacity.\n\nRelaxation doesn’t come easily because your mind keeps generating connections. Even during rest, ideas keep forming. People may suggest you’re anxious or obsessive. You’re simply wired for constant synthesis.\n\nCognitive studies show that intelligent brains have higher default-mode network activity. Thought generation doesn’t stop just because the day ends. Rest looks different for you. Mental motion is your baseline.",

    "title": "Not AT&T, Not Verizon: This Is JD Power's Overall Best In Wireless Network Quality",
    "description": "Last year, Verizon was the leading wireless network provider in multiple regions around the United States, but this year it passes the crown.",
    "fullText": "According to Vol. 1 of J.D. Power's 2026 U.S. Wireless Network Quality Performance Study, T-Mobile is your best bet for the strongest wireless network quality. The latest edition of the annual study took a look at how consistently top networks place at or near the top across every region measured. And while Verizon Wireless came out ahead in the North Central U.S. and tied T-Mobile in a few others, the magenta-colored mobile network still ended up with fewer problems reported per 100 uses overall.\n\nThat's the study's core metric: PP100. Lower PP100 scores mean better network quality. Essentially, fewer dropped calls, faster data speeds, and fewer connectivity issues during normal device use. Just because T-Mobile's PP100 scores were lowest overall doesn't mean all the other networks in competition aren't worth using, of course. Industrywide, almost all wireless networks are performing at a high level of functionality, with the only exception being AT&T.\n\nWhile J.D. Power reports the national average holding steady at a PP100 score of nine or less over the past year, AT&T was at or above that in every region they measured. The study was based on responses from 20,050 customers surveyed between June and November 2025 and also included feedback on smartphones, tablets, and home internet devices for the most comprehensive view of real-world network reliability.\n\nBig picture, T-Mobile ranks highest outright in the Southeast and Southwest with eight PP100 in both regions. It also ties with Verizon Wireless for the top spot in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and West, with scores ranging from eight to nine PP100 depending on the region. And while T-Mobile is the overall best, Verizon earned the lowest PP100 score on a region-to-region basis, with a six in North Central U.S. AT&T's 11 PP100 in the Northeast is the worst score in the entire study, region-to-region or overall, so it's not hard to see why AT&T is making some major adjustments this year.\n\nThese 2026 findings are a real shake-up compared to last year's. In 2025, Verizon Wireless was the most frequent regional leader, and national average PP100 scores were higher than they are now. Then, customers reported an average of 11 problems per 100 uses, up from nine in 2024. This year, it's back down to nine. Verizon Wireless ranked highest in four regions in 2025: Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, West, and tied with AT&T for the top spot in the Southwest. At the time, T-Mobile claimed first only in the Southeast, and with 11 PP100 to boot. With so many changes coming to T-Mobile in 2026, it'll be interesting to see how next year's findings pan out.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "It’s like nothing around today.",
    "fullText": "Ever since their discovery more than 165 years ago, massive fossilized structures left by an organism known as Prototaxites have proven impossible to categorize.\n\nResearchers in the UK have suggested in a recently published study that there's a very good reason these oddities don't fit neatly on the tree of life – they belong to a branch all of their own, with no modern equivalent.\n\nSome 400 million years ago, the swamps of the late Silurian period would have sprouted a mix of horsetails, ferns, and other prototype plants that look positively alien today.\n\nAmong them stretched 8-meter (26-foot) tall towers that defy easy identification. Wide and branchless, these organisms may have been a form of algae or ancient conifer, researchers suspect, based on what little evidence remains.\n\nFossils found on the shores of Gaspé Bay in Quebec, Canada, were initially considered by geologist John William Dawson to be the remains of rotting trees, leading to his naming it 'first conifer' back in the 1850s.\n\nThough the name stuck, confusion over the fossil's classification continued until National Museum of Natural History paleontologist Francis Hueber confirmed in 2001 that Prototaxites was indeed most likely an enormous fungus.\n\nThat conclusion was backed up years later in 2017 by a subsequent analysis of a fossil fragment assumed to be from the peripheral region of a smaller Prototaxites species named P. taiti.\n\nThe 2017 study claimed to identify textures that resembled the fertile structures of today's Ascomycota fungi.\n\nNot everybody is convinced, however, given the possibility that the distinct fragments might not have even been connected.\n\n\"In the books and books of anatomy written about living fungi, we never find structures like that,\" University of Edinburgh paleobotanist Alexander Hetherington told Erik Stokstad at Science Magazine.\n\nHetherington co-led a study on three different P. taiti fragments, concluding there's insufficient evidence to conclude Prototaxites is a fungus at all.\n\nThrough a review of microscopic anatomy and chemical analysis of its tubular structures, the team of researchers systematically eliminated each and every candidate group, leaving no modern organism with which it might share some kind of ancestral relationship.\n\nFungi? Rejected thanks to the unique way its anatomy connects.\n\nA plant or algae? Not likely given its chemical composition.\n\nA mix of the two, such as a lichen? Not with that anatomy.\n\nSome bizarre animal? Cell walls say no chance.\n\n\"Based on this investigation we are unable to assign Prototaxites to any extant lineage, reinforcing its uniqueness,\" the researchers claim.\n\n\"We conclude that the morphology and molecular fingerprint of P. taiti is clearly distinct from that of the fungi and other organisms preserved alongside it in the [Devonian deposit], and we suggest that it is best considered a member of a previously undescribed, entirely extinct group of eukaryotes.\"\n\nWhat might have happened to this long-dead group of organisms is anybody's guess. Further reviews may even return the mystifying group back to its box among ancient fungi.\n\nWithout similar specimens to relate them to, Prototaxites may simply remain a fossil anomaly – a reminder that evolution is a constant experiment, one littered with far more failures than we may ever have realized.\n\nThis research was published in Science.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in March 2025 before the research was peer-reviewed.\n\nA Cycle Deep Within Earth's Crust May Affect Climate More Than We Thought\n\nClever Cow Documented Using Tools in an Astonishing Scientific First\n\nGigantic Wave in The Pacific Was The Most Extreme 'Rogue Wave' on Record",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which ​Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a ‌U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nWhile the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required ‌that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.\n\n\"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, ⁠the people of Venezuela will ‌collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price,\" the official said.\n\nChina ‍has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.\n\nThe administration is allowing China to buy the oil at \"fair ​market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices\" at which Maduro sold oil to ‌China to pay debts, the official said.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.\n\nTrading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and ⁠the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a ​quarter of the $2 billion agreement.\n\nTrafigura completed its first ​crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero ‍and Phillips 66 and ⁠to its refinery in Italy, sources said.\n\nChina's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave ⁠after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Timothy Gardnerin Washington; Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma in New ‌Delhi; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Andrea Ricci )",

The U.S. Coast Guard declined to comment, directing inquiries to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a ⁠request for a comment.\n\nBecause the vessels' geolocating ‌beacons have not been turned on, the locations of M Sophia and Galileo were unknown until the Tankertrackers.com and witness confirmation on Wednesday.\n\nThe vessels could remain in Puerto Rico or be moved to another ‍U.S. port. The other five captured tankers are near the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Venezuelan waters and near Scotland, shipping data showed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. intervention — including the capture of President Nicolás Maduro on January 3 — is aimed at stopping drug trafficking.\n\nWashington intends to ​direct Venezuela’s government and revive the country’s crippled oil sector by bringing major U.S. oil companies in to rebuild it.\n\nTrump ‌has imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil, which in December brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have accelerated in January under U.S. supervision, but millions of barrels remain in onshore and floating storage.\n\nThe U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, sources told Reuters last week. This week, vessel Sagitta was intercepted.\n\nAlong with most tankers under Western sanctions or part of the so-called shadow fleet, many of the Venezuela-linked tankers were ⁠built over 20 years ago and pose hazards to shipping because they ​lack safety certification and adequate insurance, experts said.\n\nThat means that if they have ​a collision or oil spill, establishing insurance claims or liability is very difficult to impossible, shipping and insurance industry sources said.\n\nThe age of these tankers, which exceeds the industry standard of 15 years, also raises ‍concern about potential environmental damage, the ⁠sources said.\n\nU.S. government civil forfeiture claims related to the ship seizures can take months or years to resolve, meaning there may be no immediate solutions to the challenges.\n\n\"These 'dark fleet' tankers can be incredibly unsafe. They are elderly, their crew ⁠work in unsafe conditions, lack the appropriate classification surveys, and they are often backed by fake insurance or no insurance at all,\" said David Tannenbaum, ‌a director at consulting firm Blackstone Compliance Services.",

    "description": "More precious than gold.",
    "fullText": "Amidst a cache of glittering golden treasures from the Iberian Bronze Age, a pair of corroded objects might be the most precious of all.\n\nA dull bracelet and a rusted hollow hemisphere decorated with gold are forged, researchers have found, not out of metal from beneath the ground, but with iron from meteorites that fell from the sky.\n\nThe discovery, led by now-retired head of conservation at the National Archeological Museum in Spain, Salvador Rovira-Llorens, was revealed in a paper in 2024, and suggests that metalworking technology and techniques in Iberia more than 3,000 years ago were far more advanced than we thought.\n\nThe Treasure of Villena, as the cache of 66 mostly gold objects is known, was discovered more than 60 years ago in 1963 in what is now Alicante in Spain, and has since come to be regarded as one of the most important examples of Bronze Age goldsmithing in the Iberian Peninsula, and the whole of Europe.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary:\n\nDetermining the age of the collection has been somewhat difficult, thanks to two objects: a small, hollow hemisphere, thought to be part of a scepter or sword hilt; and a single, torc-like bracelet.\n\nBoth have what archaeologists have described as a \"ferrous\" appearance – that is, they seem to be made of iron.\n\nIn the Iberian Peninsula, the Iron Age – where smelted terrestrial iron began to replace bronze – didn't start until around 850 BCE.\n\nThe problem is that the gold materials have been dated to between 1500 and 1200 BCE. So working out where the ferrous-looking artifacts sit in the context of the Treasure of Villena has been something of a puzzle.\n\nBut iron ore from Earth's crust is not the only source of malleable iron. There are a number of pre-Iron Age iron artifacts around the world that were forged from the stuff of meteorites.\n\nPerhaps most famous is the meteoritic iron dagger of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, but there are other Bronze Age weapons made of the material, and they were very highly prized.\n\nThere is a way to tell the difference: iron from meteorites has a much higher nickel content than iron dug out of Earth's ground.\n\nSo researchers obtained permission from the Municipal Archaeological Museum of Villena, which houses the collection, to carefully test the two artifacts, and determine just how much nickel they contained.\n\nThey carefully took samples of both artifacts and subjected the material to mass spectrometry to determine their composition.\n\nIn spite of the high degree of corrosion, which alters the elemental makeup of the artifact, the results strongly suggest that both the hemisphere and the bracelet were made from meteoritic iron.\n\nThis neatly solves the dilemma of how the two artifacts align with the rest of the collection: They were made around the same period, dating back to around 1400 to 1200 BCE.\n\n\"The available data suggest that the cap and bracelet from the Treasure of Villena would currently be the first two pieces attributable to meteoritic iron in the Iberian Peninsula,\" the researchers explain in their paper, \"which is compatible with a Late Bronze chronology, prior to the beginning of the widespread production of terrestrial iron.\"\n\nNow, because the objects are so badly corroded, the results aren't conclusive. But there are more recent, non-invasive techniques that could be applied to the objects to obtain a more detailed set of data that would help cement the findings, the team suggests.\n\nThe findings were published in Trabajos de Prehistoria.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in February 2024.\n\nWorld's Oldest Rock Art Discovered in Indonesian Cave\n\nOne Change to Your Reading Habit Fights Stress And Misinformation\n\nPlaying Video Games Has an Unexpected Effect on Kids' IQ, Study Says",

    "description": "Integrated energy giant Chevron has a strong business, an attractive yield, and a rock-solid balance sheet.",
    "fullText": "Energy is integral to the world, and every investor should probably have some exposure to the sector.\n\nChevron is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies, providing diversification across the energy sector.\n\nChevron offers an attractive combination of yield and financial strength, relative to its closest peers.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›\n\nThe world is trying to shift away from dirtier energy sources, such as coal and oil. However, it's likely to be a long transition. Oil and natural gas will both be needed for decades to come, as the most likely energy strategy is an \"all of the above\" approach.\n\nEvery investor should probably have some exposure to the energy sector. That's the foundational reason why you should consider adding Chevron (NYSE: CVX) to your portfolio. Here are three company-specific reasons why.\n\nThe energy sector is volatile by nature, with oil and natural gas prices rising and falling regularly. You could focus on a narrow niche of the industry, but most investors will be best served by a company with a diversified portfolio of assets that provide exposure to the entire energy value chain. That's what integrated energy companies like Chevron do.\n\nChevron is best known for its oil and natural gas production, which falls into the upstream segment of the industry. However, it also owns energy infrastructure assets, such as pipelines, which help move oil and natural gas around the world.\n\nThat's the midstream. It also owns chemical and refining businesses that operate in the downstream segment of the industry. These businesses process energy into the products that actually get used, like gasoline.\n\nEach segment of the industry operates a little differently through the energy cycle. The best example of the benefit is that low oil prices put pressure on upstream producers but reduce costs in the downstream segment, where oil is a key input into the production of other products. From a foundational perspective, integrated Chevron has an attractive business model.\n\nChevron's dividend yield is currently 4.1%. That's well above the S&P 500 index's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 1.1% yield and the 3.3% yield of the average energy stock. Chevron clearly has an attractive yield on an absolute level.\n\nChevron, however, doesn't have the highest yield among its closest integrated energy peers. That title goes to TotalEnergies at around 5.9%. However, Chevron does have an over 30-year streak of annual dividend increases behind it. That's second in the sector to ExxonMobil's over-40-year streak, but Exxon's yield is only around 3.1%. All in, Chevron is a reliable dividend stock with an attractive yield that stands out from its peers.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — A man accused of offering a $10,000 bounty over Snapchat for the life of a top Border Patrol leader was found not guilty on Thursday in the first criminal trial stemming from the Chicago-area immigration crackdown that started last year.\n\nJurors deliberated less than 4 hours before returning the favorable verdict for 37-year-old Juan Espinoza Martinez. He faced one count of murder-for-hire and up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Testimony lasted mere hours in the federal trial that was the latest test of the Trump administration’s credibility on federal surges that have played out from Minnesota to Maine.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who wore a suit and tie, listened intently with his arms crossed near his stomach. He hugged his attorneys and shook their hands after court adjourned.\n\nAttorneys for the defense declined comment. Prosecutors did not address reporters waiting in the lobby of the federal court in downtown Chicago. Neither did jurors.\n\nAt the heart of the government’s case were Snapchat messages sent from Espinoza Martinez to his younger brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant. One read in part “10k if u take him down,” along with a picture of Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official who has led aggressive crackdowns nationwide, including in the Chicago area.\n\n“Those words do not indicate that this was a joke,” First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Yonan told jurors during Thursday's closing arguments. “Those words have meaning. They are not innocent and harmless words.”\n\nBut defense attorneys said the government didn’t show any evidence against Espinoza Martinez who sent the messages as “neighborhood gossip” after coming home from work and unwinding with beers. He didn’t follow up on the exchanges and had only a few dollars in his bank account.\n\n“Sending a message about gossip that you heard in the neighborhood, it’s not murder for hire,” his defense attorney Dena Singer told jurors. “It’s not a federal crime.”\n\nHer office did not return a message seeking comment after the verdict. Neither did the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago or the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn court, prosecutors accused Espinoza Martinez of being “fixated and obsessed” with Bovino and cited other messages where he criticized the crackdown.\n\nEspinoza Martinez was arrested in October as the city of 2.7 million and surrounding suburbs were seeing a surge of federal immigration officers. Protests and standoffs with agents were common, particularly in the city’s heavily Mexican Little Village neighborhood where Espinoza Martinez lived.\n\nHe did not testify at his trial.\n\nBut attorneys played clips of his interview with law enforcement where he said he was confused about the charges and that he sent the messages without much thought while scrolling social media after work.\n\n“I didn’t threaten anyone,” he told investigators, interchanging English and Spanish at times in the interview. “I’m not saying that I was telling them to do it.”\n\nBorn in Mexico, he’s lived in Chicago for years but doesn’t have citizenship.\n\nDHS touted Espinoza Martinez’s arrest on social media with unredacted photos of his face, referring to him as a “depraved” gang member. Bovino has held the case up as an example of the increasing dangers faced by federal agents. Prosecutors included Yonan, the second-highest ranking federal prosecutor in the Chicago region.\n\nBut several federal lawsuits in Chicago have fueled skepticism about DHS’s narratives. Of the roughly 30 criminal cases stemming from Operation Midway Blitz, charges have been dismissed or dropped in about half. In a notable lawsuit that forced Bovino to sit for depositions, a federal judge found he lied under oath including about alleged gang threats.\n\nBovino did not testify at Espinoza Martinez’s trial.\n\nNationwide, dozens of criminal cases tied to immigration operations have also crumbled.\n\nFederal prosecutors initially referred to Espinoza Martinez as a “ranking member” of the Latin Kings, but their lack of evidence led U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow to bar testimony on the Chicago street gang at trial. According to the criminal complaint, Espinoza Martinez allegedly sent messages on behalf of the gang to other gang members.\n\nAt trial, there were minor mentions of the gang, including Espinoza Martinez saying in his interview that he had nothing to do with the Latin Kings. His brother, Oscar, testified that he took the Snapchat messages as a joke and were something he’d already seen on Facebook.\n\nSinger poked holes in the government’s case, including in the testimony of their first witness Adrian Jimenez.\n\nThe 44-year-old owns a construction company and had been in touch with Espinoza Martinez over Snapchat about work. Unknown to Espinoza Martinez, he had also worked as a paid government informant over the years after serving a prison sentence for a felony. He shared the Snapchats with a federal investigator.\n\nJimenez, who suffers from back problems, walked slowly with a limp to the witness chair and needed help getting up.\n\n“Would you solicit for hire an individual that was in that much pain and could barely walk?” Singer said to jurors. “That doesn’t make any sense.”",

We want to keep our residents safe,\" the City Manager told reporters during a multi-departmental news conference. \"Our teams have been closely monitoring forecasts to ensure we activate our winter weather operations plan.\"\n\nTransportation and Public Works Director Gus Concarly said the city is taking a \"three-pronged approach,\" including pre-treating bridges and overpasses with brine and sand. Concarly noted that 50 \"ice force\" vehicles are standing by, but warned that residential streets will not be sanded unless requested by emergency responders.\n\nDallas Water Utilities urged residents to wrap exposed pipes and locate their main water shut-off valves. Meanwhile, sanitation officials warned that while Friday collections should proceed as scheduled, garbage and recycling pickups could see significant delays on Monday and Tuesday if road conditions deteriorate.\n\n\"We are well-prepared.

Ball also issued a stern warning regarding home heating safety.\n\n\"Don't start warming fires inside the house... no cooking on the balcony,\" Ball said, reminding residents to open fireplace drafts and avoid using candles or outdoor grills indoors if the power goes out.\n\nDallas Animal Services confirmed they will be patrolling 24/7 to respond to reports of animals left in the cold. Under city ordinances, pet owners are required to bring animals indoors during extreme weather.\n\nReflecting on the deadly 2021 winter storm, city leaders emphasized improved coordination and infrastructure. Officials noted that several recreation centers have since been equipped with emergency generators, allowing them to serve as warming stations where residents can charge phones and stay warm if local power grids fail.\n\n\"We have the systems in place to make sure those communication chains... are intact,\" the City Manager said. \"Planning for events like this does not start today.\"\n\nInformation in this article is from the Dallas city leader's news conference on Wednesday.",

    "description": "The weekend is creeping closer, and with it, a snowstorm that is projected to dump multiple inches of powder on the FOX 2 viewing area.",
    "fullText": "ST. LOUIS – The weekend is creeping closer, and with it, a snowstorm that is projected to dump multiple inches of powder on the FOX 2 viewing area.\n\nWith recent data, confidence is high that the vast majority of our viewing area will see at least four inches of snow, and some counties will see much more than that. Four inches will act as our starting baseline, while our worst-case scenario is closer to a foot of snow, perhaps more by the time the storm ends on Sunday.\n\nIt all depends how the system comes together Saturday evening.\n\nThe weekend system we’re tracking is actually two systems as of Thursday morning—one north of Alaska and the other sitting just off the California coast. We’re working to determine when both pockets of energy will merge, a very intricate process. Even small changes to the when and where or that merger can mess with the alignment of the temperature profile and where precipitation (snow) will form.\n\nThe presence of dry air in the viewing area will play a big role in snow intensity on Saturday, but will have a reduced influence that same evening.\n\nData now more strongly points to a two-wave system. The first wave arrives Saturday and could leave one to three inches of light snow. There will be a break or lull until the evening, when the precipitation becomes light and patchy. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising to see some frizzing drizzle or very fine sleet for several hours between the waves. Not because of the warm/dry air but rather the changing cloud physics between the two. The second wave arrives between 9 p.m. and midnight, with moderate to heavy snowfall into Sunday morning. Light snow may linger into the early afternoon before the system pulls away.\n\nHowever, with a two-wave system, the biggest snowfall totals will come in areas that “double dip” both waves. The greatest overlap is slated for areas along and southeast of Interstate 44 and south of metro St. Louis. We’re projecting six to 10 inches in those areas, centered on a line near Rolla through Park Hills/Farmington and then into Illinois along the Kaskaskia River.\n\nSt. Louis radar: See a map of current weather here\n\nThere could an even heavier band of eight to 12 inches of snow in the far southern viewing area for Reynolds, Iron, and Madison counties in southeast Missouri. The I-70 corridor will get a glancing blow from the first wave but could get the full brunt of the second wave. With more confidence in the track of wave 2, we’re looking at widespread totals of four to eight inches of accumulation across the metro area.\n\nWinds will not be extreme but they will get gusty, with speeds topping 20 to 25 miles per hour, which is going to result in drifting snow, particularly in open and rural areas.\n\nNew data is always rolling in. You can watch us on our smart TV app. FOX2STL+ or the FOX 2 mobile app via the Apple or Google app stores.",
