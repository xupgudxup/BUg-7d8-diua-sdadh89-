    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have seemingly been preparing for life without linebacker Harold Landry III, and it’s a good thing they have…\n\nLandry, who has seen his snap counts dip each of the last three weeks, missed back-to-back-to-back practices prior to the AFC Championship on Sunday — with his third consecutive absence noted by MassLive’s Mark Daniels on Friday.\n\nIt’s now extremely unlikely that he will be available to play against the Denver Broncos.\n\nLandry’s knee injury has become an issue over the last month, as he averaged 46 snaps per game across the first several months of the season before seeing his totals fall to 30 against the Baltimore Ravens, 26 in the wild-card round against the Los Angeles Chargers and 11 in the divisional round against the Houston Texans. Landry also missed his club’s last two regular season games against the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins.\n\nIf you’d like a more detailed look at his overall contributions, take a look below:\n\nNew England has leaned heavily on the likes of K’Lavon Chaisson, Elijah Ponder and Anfernee Jennings with the uncertainty surrounding the captains’ availability, with the former two logging season-high snap counts across the last month.\n\nDarrell Taylor, who was signed to the practice squad two weeks ago, could be elevated as potential insurance behind that trio for the AFC Championship.\n\nNew England has gotten by playing against two below-average offensive lines thus far in the postseason, but things are changing as it will face one of the very best units in the NFL in the Denver Broncos.\n\nPatriots Lineman Return To Practice Before Broncos Game",

    "description": "Detroit Lions LB Jack Campbell is the recipient of the 2025 Pro Butkus Award.",
    "fullText": "Detroit Lions linebacker Jack Campbell has been named the recipient of the 2025 Pro Butkus Award. The award, which is more known for the identical college honors, goes to the top linebacker in the NFL, as voted on by Butkus Award Selection Committee—a selection of 51 voters from all ranks of football, including NFL front office members, scouts, and coaches.\n\n“Jack Campbell embodies everything the Butkus Award represents,” the committee said in a statement (via Hawkeyesports.com). “His size, instincts and disciplined approach to the position allow him to control the middle of the field. He plays with authority, communicates at a high level, and consistently puts himself in position to make impactful plays. His rise this season reflects not just talent, but leadership and football character.”\n\nCampbell’s 2025 season was a breakout for the third-year linebacker. He was named First-Team All Pro after tallying 176 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 5.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, and two fumble recoveries.\n\n“He’s extremely valuable,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said in December. “Right now, first of all he leads the team in amount of reps that he’s played for a season. He’s taken more reps than anybody on this team. He plays on kickoff for us and he’s an asset on kickoff and then everything you see on defense. He doesn’t come off the field, he’s our bell cow, green dot. And he does—and the guy is smart and he’s instinctive and he is snap-to-whistle all-out, all the time, in practice too. And he doesn’t take plays off, he doesn’t take days off, he goes after the football, he’s a ball guy. So, he’s invaluable.”\n\nInterestingly, this is the second time Campbell has won the award. Back in 2022, he won the college version of the award after a standout year with the Iowa Hawkeyes. That season, Campbell posted 128 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery.\n\nCampbell is heading into the fourth and final year of his rookie contract, although the Lions have an opportunity to exercise a fifth-year option worth a projected $16.4 million. The deadline to exercise that option is May 1. But the Lions may very well sign Campbell to a contract extension before then.",

    "fullText": "We asked for your views on Ethan Nwaneri's loan move to Marseille for the rest of the 2025-26 season.\n\nHere are some of your comments:\n\nKay: Ethan needs minutes to stay sharp and effective. Marseille is a brilliant, challenging environment, with a great manager and an intense fanbase that would keep anyone honest. So long as he gets minutes and, critically, Arsenal don't face an emergency injury situation in that position (unlikely), then this will be a great opportunity, possibly one that could earn him an England spot. Win-win for everyone.\n\nJohn: He's a very exciting young talent, but frozen out only because of the quality and size of the squad. He can get playing time and come back as a more experienced player, as he has a lot to offer!\n\nRyan: Yes, the lad needs game time and France offers a good league and a good team to get some. It worked very well for Saliba after all. Shame he hasn't had more time for Arsenal this year.\n\nHowever, some fans seem to think that Arsenal are losing out on depth with this loan move for Nwaneri.\n\nLara: I think this is a mistake, although it's understandable why Ethan is tempted. We have assembled arguably our strongest-ever squad and are on course for success. Odegard and Eze seem to both be struggling for form, and if we lose one of them to injury, it could prove disastrous not to have such a good player to step in.\n\nYvonne: I feel sorry for the young man. I bet he's feeling let down and wonder if he would have signed the contract had he known what he knows now.\n\nJohn S: It's a good move for Nwaneri but a bad move for Arsenal. Competing in four competitions we need depth, and it will only take a couple of injuries or player fatigue, and we'll regret letting him go. I'm sure he'll want to stick around for a winner's medal too.",

    "fullText": "The Mo Salah moment from that match that will stand out in everyone's mind is when he was through on goal but absolutely shanked his effort wide. He'd tried to take the shot with the outside of his left foot but miscalculated completely, thumping it with his laces and sending it out for a goal kick.\n\nSalah at his best finishes that without much fuss. It was his bread and butter just a year ago, in fact.\n\nSo what's happened? Many will say he's finished or he's declined or that he's just not the player he was a year ago. Now, the latter two may be true but you've got to remember how a player declines.\n\nThey don't suddenly lose their ability to kick a football. Nor do they forget how to finish. Instead, they don't have the same burst that they did. Players don't move as smoothly and they find they're a second off the pace compared to younger players.\n\nAnd maybe that's true for Salah! But that miss wasn't a sign of him being past it - it was a sign of things just not coming naturally to him for the first time.\n\nBecause things have been essentially flawless since Salah joined Liverpool and rapidly developed into one of the world's best players. He hasn't struggled with form particularly often, nor has his position been under threat.\n\nSalah has never snatched at chances or anything like that. Right now, though, he absolutely is and it must be because he's actually suffering from doubts for once.\n\nEager to impress? To prove people wrong? Salah isn't playing naturally and getting his head back on the right track is vital for Liverpool and Slot right now.\n\nMaybe it's time to embrace a more central role? Something less reliant on bursts of pace. Because finding the magic formula to getting Salah confident and in rhythm will almost certainly deliver an elite player once again.\n\nThat terrible miss in France was a sign that Salah has a problem. Fortunately, it's a problem that can absolutely be fixed.",

A return to the Arizona Diamondbacks may be the most likely outcome for Gallen. However, there are at least four other clubs with interest in the 2023 All-Star.\n\n\"The Diamondbacks would love to get him back and are considered the front-runners to re-sign him (and wouldn’t have to give up a draft pick to do it),\" The Athletic's Jim Bowden wrote Friday. \"However, several teams have shown interest, including the Orioles, Braves, Giants, Tigers, and others.\"\n\nIn 33 starts with the Diamondbacks, Gallen, 30, had a career high 4.83 ERA. His ground ball rate dropped from 46.2% in 2024 to 44.4% last season. Not a huge decrease, but Gallen has also not shown the same strikeout prowess that helped him finish third in the NL Cy Young voting three seasons ago.\n\nThe Orioles are one of the clubs rumored to have interest in Valdez, so they could pivot to Gallen if they miss out on the former Houston Astros ace.\n\nBowden projects that Gallen could sign a short-term deal to regain his value as a top-of-the-rotation starter, before re-entering the market in an offseason or two.\n\nMets offer to Kyle Tucker before Dodgers' $240 million deal revealed by former MLB GM\n\nKyle Tucker contract details: How much deferred money did Dodgers give new star?\n\nDodgers continue to frustrate all of MLB with major Kyle Tucker signing\n\nRed Sox get big trade update on Brendan Donovan amid updated rumors\n\nFormer Cubs, Twins All-Star utilityman to sign with Rockies on two-year deal\n\nMets get bad news on free-agent Cody Bellinger amid strong Yankees offer",

    "fullText": "Former Canadian Olympic snowboarder and alleged drug kingpin Ryan Wedding has been arrested in Mexico and will be extradited to the US after years on the run, FBI Director Kash Patel has said.\n\nWedding, who had been on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, is accused of running a transnational drug trafficking operation that moved tonnes of cocaine across international borders.\n\nWedding, 44, was also wanted on murder charges. US officials had said they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the Sinaloa drug cartel's protection.\n\nThe head of Canada's federal police force, which assisted in the investigation, spoke alongside Patel on Friday to praise the law enforcement operation.\n\n\"No single agency or nation can combat transnational organised crime alone,\" said Mike Duheme, Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\n\"We can finally say that our communities, our countries, are much safer with the arrest of Ryan Wedding,\" he added.\n\nWedding is accused of running a vast drug trafficking operation responsible for importing some 60 metric tonnes of cocaine a year.\n\nThe organisation operated across North America, as well as several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and was also the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada, bringing in an estimated $1bn a year.\n\nBefore he was arrested, Wedding was accused of killing a federal witness in a case against him. Officials say he has also ordered the murders of several others.\n\nWedding is now facing a slew of felony charges, including witness tampering and intimidation, murder, money laundering and drug trafficking.\n\nThe FBI had previously placed a $15m (£11m) reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nUS officials have not released any information regarding how Wedding was captured, except to say that his arrest took place on Thursday night in Mexico City.\n\nThe Associated Press, citing an unnamed Mexican Security Cabinet member, reported that Wedding turned himself in at the US embassy.\n\nIn his remarks at a news conference, Patel described Wedding as a \"modern-day Pablo Escobar\", referring to the Colombian cartel leader. US officials have also compared him to Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán in Mexico.\n\n\"When you go after a guy like Ryan Wedding, it takes a united front,\" Patel said, thanking Canadian and Mexican authorities for their help in the investigation.\n\nWedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\", the FBI said. He has reportedly had plastic surgery to change his appearance while on the run.\n\nOfficials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.\n\nAuthorities allege he has ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.\n\nPatel also spoke about the recent arrest of another man in Mexico who had been on the FBI's most wanted list.\n\nAmerican man Alejandro Castillo was wanted for the murder of his ex-girlfriend. According to the FBI, he has been in hiding in Mexico for nearly 10 years, and will now be extradited back to North Carolina for trial.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea boss Sonia Bompastor says the club are \"probably close\" to announcing a new stadium option as they start to outgrow primary stadium Kingsmeadow.\n\nTheir Kingston-based ground has a capacity of 4,850, including 2,265 seats, and is usually sold out. They also use Stamford Bridge for one-off games but in general, attendances still lag far behind those of London rivals Arsenal, despite Chelsea having won significantly more trophies in recent seasons.\n\nAttendance leaders Arsenal now play all home matches at their 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium and are averaging 36,450 fans per game. Last year, they had a high of 56,748 for the north London derby against Tottenham.\n\nMeanwhile Chelsea's average is nearly 30,000 fewer, at 6,397.\n\nBefore taking on Arsenal in the Women's Super League on Saturday, BBC Sport asked Bompastor how Chelsea can begin to close that gap.\n\n\"Congrats to Arsenal because they are doing an amazing job with their fanbase,\" she said. \"That's probably where every club wants to be.\n\n\"A lot of conversations are happening in the background with me, the club's ownership and CEO Aki [Mandhar]. We want to move in that direction. We expect 30,000 tomorrow and are excited to go into that atmosphere with these fans.\"\n\nBrentford are among the clubs known to be open to hosting additional football matches at their 17,250-capacity stadium in west London, while Queens Park Rangers and Wimbledon also play in grounds larger than Kingsmeadow.\n\n\"It's important for clubs like Chelsea to have a back-up plan,\" Bompastor added.\n\n\"The club is having some really good conversations about the future and the stadium because when you play many games in a season with your men's team and women's team, and you play Champions League, sometimes you can have clashes.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bears made it to the NFC Divisional round, but lost to the Los Angeles Rams. While not the ideal end to the year, the heroics of Caleb Williams and the transformational nature of Ben Johnson were big wins this season.\n\nAfter 2025, the bears are in a much better spot than they were a year ago. Johnson might be the coach of the year, and his staff is, predictably, at risk of being poached this offseason after how impressive the offense was in 2025.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, the Bears are now at risk of losing one of Johnon's offensive coaches to the Philadelphia Eagles. This situation is partially Johnson's fault, but it's a good problem to have.\n\n\"Chicago offensive coordinator Declan Doyle is a name to watch,\" Fowler reports. \"The Bears did not block Philly's request to interview Doyle, which means he's free to make the lateral move.\"\n\nDeclan Doyle is the Bears' offensive coordinator and is interviewing for the Eagles' offensive coordinator opening.\n\nTypically, teams won't allow their own coaches to interview for lateral jobs. But Johnson wants to let his coaches explore new options and is letting Doyle take this interview.\n\nMore: Bears' list of 2026 NFL draft picks, free agents and cap space going into offseason\n\nThere's no guarantee that he lands the job, but with how great the Bears performed in 2025, and the Eagles looking for an impressive offensive mind to lead their offense after the Kevin Patullo disaster, Doyle might be the highest-upside play.\n\nDoyle isn't calling plays in Chicago, but in Philadelphia, he would get to lead the Eagles offense, which just a year ago, made it to the Super Bowl and won.\n\nLosing Doyle would sting, but it would be a great sign for the Bears that teams are trying to poach their offensive staff. If fans wanted proof that Johnson is viewed highly around the league, this interview situation with Doyle and the Eagles couldn't be better proof.\n\nBears' Colston Loveland makes NFL history never done by a rookie tight end before\n\nVideo shows un-Bear-able pain as QB Caleb Williams exits playoff stage\n\nWhat did Caleb Williams see on that miraculous TD pass to Cole Kmet?\n\n3 reasons Caleb Williams, Bears aren't a playoff fluke and here to stay as NFC contenders\n\nThat throw is why the Bears drafted Caleb Williams 1st overall\n\nCaleb Williams interceptions today: Bears QB throws away Chicago's comeback chances in OT loss to Rams",

    "fullText": "Recent rumours linking Douglas Luiz with a move to Chelsea have been cast into doubt following Liam Rosenior’s latest comments.\n\nChelsea’s need for a midfielder increased after Dario Essugo suffered an injury setback, and with Romeo Lavia still out without a clear return date, options are limited.\n\nLiam Rosenior has generally used a midfield two or three this season, adjusting based on who’s available. Enzo Fernandez has often stepped into a more advanced role during Cole Palmer’s absence.\n\nLiam Rosenior was asked about the potential signing of a central midfielder at his pre-match press conference ahead of Crystal Palace.\n\nHe responded by saying this (as per Football.London):\n\n“Unfortunately, Dario picked up a really unfortunate injury. He slipped in training and will be out for over a month. Romeo is on the way back, which is great. He’s a very, very good player at a very high level.\n\n“We have Enzo, Moi, Andrey Santos and Reece James – it’s not bad. I don’t want to bring in players that don’t enhance the group or the chemistry we’re building.”\n\nDouglas Luiz is open to the idea of joining Chelsea.\n\nHe’s a smart player who has already shown he can handle the Premier League, though it’s been a while since we’ve seen him at his best like during his time at Aston Villa.\n\nHis flexibility could be an asset, as he can slot into either an eight or six role. But he’s not in top form right now and looks a bit behind other Chelsea midfielders defensively, especially when you look at ball recoveries.\n\nChelsea have some good defensive options in their midfield already, so if Luiz does come in, it might just be as cover for someone else.",

    "description": "Udinski is a rising star, but not ready for an NFL head coach position.",
    "fullText": "With the victories come the spoils, or the losses. The losses don’t show up on the scoreboard, but in the pieces that are lost from the victor’s staff. Such is the potential for the Jacksonville Jaguars this offseason with their staff. Defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile recently had a second interview with the Arizona Cardinals, this time in person. But he is not the only Jacksonville coordinator attracting attention from other NFL teams. Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski has been identified as someone who could one day become a head coach. The Buffalo Bills, who recently fired their head coach, are seeking a new coach and have reached out to Udinski for an interview. The 30-year-old Udinski is considered a very bright offensive mind, and he could be really considered by Buffalo for their head coaching position. But life always has a way of showing us the mistakes we made.\n\nHiring coaches who have not called plays offensively has been shown to us before. In fact, the Tennessee Titans showed us this in 2024 when they hired Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan. He had worked with a multitude of talented quarterbacks, including Peyton Manning and Joe Burrow in some aspects. And even though he was the offensive coordinator in Cincinnati, he did not call the plays. He did, however, put together the gameplans. While Callahan's involvement in the game plans and putting them together was paramount, it does not replace the feel that comes with calling plays. Knowing when and where to call different things in different situations is something that comes with experience in that position. While Callahan may have considered all scenarios when he was the offensive coordinator, that cannot replace the in-tune feeling for what situations call for at certain moments.\n\nWith Udinski, he is a coordinator who has not called plays in Jacksonville. He is surely a part of the braintrust regarding the Jacksonville offense that has helped make Trevor Lawrence an MVP Finalist this year. But when you move over a seat from the assistant to the head coach, things get a little different, as Brian Callahan can attest to. Combine that lack of play-calling experience with the pressure cooker that is the Buffalo Bills' job right now, and Udinski would be entering a situation that could put pressure on him he may not be ready to handle. And in that case, it could ultimately lead to him having a quicker exit than he would want there. Overall, while he is being considered for the job, he may not be the right man for the job at this time and may need more room to grow.\n\nCalling plays does not seem like a big deal to many on the outside looking in, but it is something prospective head coaches need to do the majority of the time. While Udinski is a candidate in Buffalo and is hailed as an ascending coach, the fact of the matter is that he may do best by gaining that play-calling experience before becoming a head coach for longevity’s sake.",

    "description": "Ryan Wedding turned himself in at US consulate in Mexico City and is due to appear in court in California on Monday",
    "fullText": "Ryan Wedding, the Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin, has been arrested after turning himself in at the US embassy in Mexico, law enforcement officials announced on Friday.\n\nWedding, 44, had been sought by the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) for his role in overseeing what the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the “one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations” in the world.\n\n“He thought he could evade justice … here we are today, bringing him to justice,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said from an airfield in California, calling Wedding the “largest narco-trafficker in modern times”.\n\nMexico’s security minister, Omar García Harfuch, said that Wedding “surrendered voluntarily” at the US embassy in Mexico City on Wednesday after evading police for nearly a decade.\n\nWedding was flown from Mexico to California and is custody. He is due to appear in court on Monday in California. He is charged with drug trafficking, conspiracy to murder, witness tampering and money laundering.\n\nOfficials in the US allege that Wedding’s organisation had moved nearly 60 metric tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles from Mexico using a network of semitrucks. Wedding is also accused of ordering the killing of a key FBI witness as well as several other murders, including that of a couple who were killed in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSince 2023, the RCMP and the FBI have been collaborating on a sprawling investigation known as Operation Giant Slalom. In March, 2025, Wedding was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted List.\n\n“We told you in November we would find Mr Wedding. Today, that day has arrived,” said Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office. “The long arm of the law extends beyond our border.”\n\nDavid said the arrest was a “good day” for victims. “Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same,” he said. “But today, they get the justice that they sought.”\n\nDavis said in addition to “crushing sanctions” against 19 people, including Wedding, authorities also seized a Mercedes sports car worth $15m and motorcycles worth $40m.\n\nUS authorities had previously said that they believed Wedding to be in hiding in Mexico. On Thursday, Patel was in Mexico City for what he called “pre-planned” meetings with the country’s security chief, García Harfuch. And on Friday morning he left with a souvenir: Ryan Wedding, and another, unnamed, “priority objective”.\n\nThe decision for an FBI director to be present in the field for an arrest is exceedingly rare and speaks to the political focus on capturing Wedding.\n\nGarcía Harfuch released a statement saying that Patel was leaving with “a non-US citizen who was arrested by Mexican authorities and is among the FBI’s 10 most wanted, and a Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered yesterday at the US embassy”.\n\n“If it’s true that he handed himself in, this may be an attempt to negotiate better terms,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, an analyst with the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime. “Maybe it gives him a little more room for manoeuvre.”\n\nOr there could be another explanation: he feared for his safety in Mexico, said Farfán-Méndez.\n\nThe arrest comes at a time of tension in North America, with Mark Carney and Donald Trump clashing at Davos, and renewed threats of US military strikes on Mexican cartel targets.\n\n“There was a message from the secretary of state, talking about the need for tangible results [against organised crime],” said Farfán-Méndez. “I think grabbing Ryan Wedding is a very media-friendly way to show tangible results. I think it could be filed under that column.”\n\nAlejandro Rosales Castillo, one of the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives, who is accused of the murder of a woman in North Carolina in 2016, was also arrested. A US citizen, he crossed the border to Mexico in 2017 and was in hiding for almost a decade until he was captured in Pachuca, Hidalgo, on 16 January.\n\nNBC News first announced news of the arrest and US law enforcement officials familiar with the operation confirmed it to the Guardian.\n\nIn March, the FBI announced a $15m reward for the capture of Wedding, whose nicknames include “Public Enemy”, “El Jefe” and “Giant”.\n\nAt the time,Patel, compared Wedding to Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.\n\nThe head of the RCMP, Michael Duheme was also present at the announcement and said “no single country” can break up transnational drug-trafficking organizations.\n\nWedding was allegedly being protected by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico while he was on the run.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that Wedding’s significance in the international drug trade had been exaggerated by US authorities and the media.\n\n“There’s been a high-level characterisation of Wedding as a major kingpin. There was a $15m reward for him. At least from a media standpoint, he was a big fish,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But I think the indictment gives a different sense of proportion.”\n\nThough US authorities claim Wedding’s enterprise was trafficking 60 tonnes of cocaine a year, this figure does not appear in the indictment, which only mentions specific cases of a few hundred kilos being moved at a time.\n\n“These arrests are important for law enforcement,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But whether they impact [drug] supply is another question.”",

    "fullText": "Cameron Smotherman was involved in a frightening scene on Friday, as he collapsed onstage during his weigh-in ahead of UFC 324.\n\nSmotherman was scheduled to face Ricky Turcios in a bantamweight contest on Saturday night, with the fight taking place at Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena.\n\nHowever, the bout was cancelled after Smotherman fainted while trying to walk off the stage, following a successful weigh-in.\n\nThe American, 28, was 0.5lb inside the 136lb limit, but he appeared dazed and stumbled as he stepped off the scales, before he fell face first onto the floor.\n\nA panel of presenters was hosting the UFC’s live stream of the weigh-in, with UFC champion-turned-commentator Daniel Cormier exclaiming, “Oh, no!”, while colleague Laura Sanko said, “Oh, s***. Oh, my God.”\n\nThe visual feed immediately cut to Cormier, Sanko, ex-UFC champion Chris Weidman and their co-host Dan Hellie. Meanwhile, Smotherman was aided by a member of his team, a UFC medical staff member, and other personnel.\n\nAfter cutting away again, the visual feed soon revisited Smotherman, who was lying on his back and awake, before he was able to sit up. The next time the camera cut to the stage, Smotherman was on his side in the recovery position and still conscious. Before long, Smotherman was helped to his feet and off the stage.\n\nHeading into UFC 324, Smotherman was hoping to snap a two-fight losing streak, having come up short against Serhiy Sidey in May and Ricky Simon in a quick turnaround in June. Both fights were lost on points, and Smotherman’s only previous UFC outing was a decision win over Jake Hadley in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Turcios is 2-3 in the UFC and is also on a two-fight losing streak. The American, 32, lost to Benardo Sopaj last time out, suffering a points defeat in January 2025.\n\nAlso at the UFC 324 weigh-in, Deiveson Figueiredo and Alex Perez missed weight for their respective fights.\n\nPerez weighed in at 128.5lb for his scheduled clash with Charles Johnson at flyweight, where Figueiredo is a former champion. However, Figueiredo has fought at bantamweight in recent years, and he similarly missed his limit by 2.5lb on Friday, ahead of a planned bout with Umar Nurmagomedov.\n\nFigueiredo accepted a 20 per cent fine, with that money going to Nurmagomedov, and their fight will go ahead as planned. It is expected that the same will apply to Perez and Johnson.\n\nIn better news, the main event was made official after Paddy Pimblett and Justin Gaethje both made weight for their interim title fight at 155lb.\n\nLiverpool’s “Paddy The Baddy” tipped the scales at 155lb, before former interim champion Gaethje weighed in at 154lb. The winner of their clash is expected to be next for regular champion Ilia Topuria, a bitter rival of Pimblett.",

    "description": "Val Sopi left his service company to pursue recurring revenue. Now, his first SaaS is at a 5-figure ARR. Here's how he did it.",
    "fullText": "Val Sopi left a successful service company in order to access stable, recurring revenue.\n\nHis first attempt, BlogMaker, started as a challenge to create a product in 20 hours. Now, it's at a 5-figure ARR.\n\nHere's Val on how he did it. 👇\n\nI'm a graphic designer by education, and a developer and marketer by trade. I wear many hats and enjoy jumping from product to sales on a daily basis.\n\nInitially, I ran a successful web shop serving larger organizations and non-profits with bespoke web applications. But I wanted to build SaaS products to create more stable and predictable revenue streams — and to offer the potential to exit at some point.\n\nBlogMaker.app began as a personal challenge. I wanted to test my limits and launch a fully working product within 20 hours. This was back in April 2021, when we hand-coded everything — no vibe coding or AI involved.\n\nSo, I built a blog engine for small teams and solo founders who want to publish for SEO purposes. I went full time on it in October 2022, after noticing positive traction and retention. It's currently a 5–figure ARR business with 50% month–to–month growth.\n\nThe initial version took about 20 hours, as I mentioned. That was split into about 3 sessions. I had a working product and payment from a customer right after launch.\n\nSince those early days, BlogMaker has gone through hundreds of updates.\n\nI work with a highly customized forked version of CodeIgniter3 for the backend and jQuery for the front. It's my favorite combo for shipping fast. And I work with zero external libraries to reduce the overhead of constantly upgrading various dependencies.\n\nSince I run solo, I keep that to a minimum.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges I faced was unlocking a distribution channel that consistently delivered. I haven't completely overcome that challenge.\n\nInitially, I told everyone I knew in all my circles: Twitter, Slack, even offline meetups.\n\nI'm still super active on Twitter, but it doesn't bring in new customers. I mostly share lessons and my journey with my online friends. My user base doesn't overlap much.\n\nThese days, I focus on SEO and AEO because they are the most viable intent-based approaches to growth.\n\nSEO initially feels like a slog, but it's amazing how quickly you can rank with even short articles that answer a simple question — a strategy AI also relies on.\n\nSo, I run two blogs. One covers feature updates and product news. The other is about SEO strategy, and it's where I publish \"vs\" and \"alternative to\" posts, as well as \"how-to\" articles based on questions people search for.\n\nOther than that, I produce videos about the product, new features, demos, and other content that resonates with my target audience. I also update the guide, change website copy, build relationships and partnerships, and sometimes do cold outreach.\n\nA good example is a recent partnership with RightBlogger.com, which directly integrates with BlogMaker and helps customers write highly comprehensive SEO articles with AI.\n\nInitially, BlogMaker offered only yearly prices; while good for clients, this made building a sustainable business difficult. I transitioned to monthly pricing, but that proved challenging because the brand was previously positioned and consistently marketed with yearly pricing. Consequently, signups expected yearly pricing and did not convert.\n\nHowever, recently, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) has almost overtaken all previous MRR from yearly subscriptions, proving again that a monthly subscription model offers a sustainable approach for a growing business.\n\nIncreasing prices also had a positive impact on revenue, but I never increased prices for existing clients. Instead, I offered them a way to gracefully upgrade to newer plans and features.\n\nIn this journey, I've realized that taking care of myself is paramount to my product's success.\n\nWhen I started building SaaS products, I would go days without much physical activity because building and growing a product would suck me in. But that quickly backfired and eventually led me to a burnout circa 2020, which was not fun to experience.\n\nNow, I try to balance myself, even though I can still outwork anyone on the planet!\n\nThat means I try to get 7K steps per day. I also go to the gym at least four times a week to lift weights. Whenever I feel off, lifting weights is my escape.\n\nI also meditate. It helps me become more patient and focused. It also helps better observe myself and detach from my thoughts, which often stem from my environment, upbringing, etc. Distinguishing between beneficial and detrimental thoughts has been a game changer.\n\nI see a ton of early-stage indie hackers focusing on the product first. This is highly risky because you don't know if many people experience the problem you're trying to solve regularly.\n\nWhile \"scratching your own itch\" can be a good approach, it requires significant luck to succeed; many other people must share your specific need.\n\nI now highly recommend looking for what people buy (the product), what types of customers buy it (potentially business people), and how they find the product (channels and distribution).\n\nOther criteria include why you are the right person to build such a thing (and if not, how you can become that person), and your unfair go-to-market advantage.\n\nMy immediate goals for BlogMaker are to grow it to a 5-figure MRR business with at least 80% in profits. Long-term, I plan to continue iterating based on the latest technologies and customer requirements.\n\nThe world of SEO, now with AI, is moving fast, and I want BlogMaker to be at the front of it all.\n\nI also recently started another product, AMSDeck.com, geared towards bigger organizations. This product came from extensive research, based on Rob Walling's teachings, particularly his most recent course, which I highly recommend: The SaaS Launchpad. You cannot skim this course; it demands dedication and offers significant rewards.\n\nYou can follow along on my podcast and I occasionally blog at valsopi.com. The holding company of one that produced BlogMaker, AMSDeck, and other products is Handmade Spaceships, Inc.",

    "description": "An automated routing policy configuration error caused us to leak some Border Gateway Protocol prefixes unintentionally from a router at our Miami data center. We discuss the impact and the changes we are implementing as a result.",
    "fullText": "On January 22, 2026, an automated routing policy configuration error caused us to leak some Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) prefixes unintentionally from a router at our data center in Miami, Florida. While the route leak caused some impact to Cloudflare customers, multiple external parties were also affected because their traffic was accidentally funnelled through our Miami data center location.\n\nThe route leak lasted 25 minutes, causing congestion on some of our backbone infrastructure in Miami, elevated loss for some Cloudflare customer traffic, and higher latency for traffic across these links. Additionally, some traffic was discarded by firewall filters on our routers that are designed to only accept traffic for Cloudflare services and our customers.\n\nWhile we’ve written about route leaks before, we rarely find ourselves causing them. This route leak was the result of an accidental misconfiguration on a router in Cloudflare’s network, and only affected IPv6 traffic. We sincerely apologize to the users, customers, and networks we impacted yesterday as a result of this BGP route leak.\n\nWe have written multiple times about BGP route leaks, and we even record route leak events on Cloudflare Radar for anyone to view and learn from. To get a fuller understanding of what route leaks are, you can refer to this detailed background section, or refer to the formal definition within RFC7908.\n\nEssentially, a route leak occurs when a network tells the broader Internet to send it traffic that it's not supposed to forward. Technically, a route leak occurs when a network, or Autonomous System (AS), appears unexpectedly in an AS path. An AS path is what BGP uses to determine the path across the Internet to a final destination. An example of an anomalous AS path indicative of a route leak would be finding a network sending routes received from a peer to a provider.\n\nDuring this type of route leak, the rules of valley-free routing are violated, as BGP updates are sent from AS64501 to their peer (AS64502), and then unexpectedly up to a provider (AS64503). Oftentimes the leaker, in this case AS64502, is not prepared to handle the amount of traffic they are going to receive and may not even have firewall filters configured to accept all of the traffic coming in their direction. In simple terms, once a route update is sent to a peer or provider, it should only be sent further to customers and not to another peer or provider AS.\n\nDuring the incident on January 22, we caused a similar kind of route leak, in which we took routes from some of our peers and redistributed them in Miami to some of our peers and providers. According to the route leak definitions in RFC7908, we caused a mixture of Type 3 and Type 4 route leaks on the Internet.\n\nA change that ultimately triggers the routing policy bug is merged in our network automation code repository\n\nAutomation is run on single Miami edge-router resulting in unexpected advertisements to BGP transit providers and peers\n\nNetwork team begins investigating unintended route advertisements from Miami\n\nIncident is raised to coordinate response\n\nThe bad configuration change is manually reverted by a network operator, and automation is paused for the router, so it cannot run again\n\nThe change that triggered the leak is reverted from our code repository\n\nAutomation is confirmed by operators to be healthy to run again on the Miami router, without the routing policy bug\n\nAutomation is unpaused on the single router in Miami\n\nOn January 22, 2026, at 20:25 UTC, we pushed a change via our policy automation platform to remove the BGP announcements from Miami for one of our data centers in Bogotá, Colombia. This was purposeful, as we previously forwarded some IPv6 traffic through Miami toward the Bogotá data center, but recent infrastructure upgrades removed the need for us to do so.\n\nThis change generated the following diff (a program that compares configuration files in order to determine how or whether they differ):\n\nWhile this policy change looks innocent at a glance, only removing the prefix lists containing BOG04 unicast prefixes resulted in a policy that was too permissive:\n\nThe policy would now mark every prefix of type “internal” as acceptable, and proceed to add some informative communities to all matching prefixes. But more importantly, the policy also accepted the route through the policy filter, which resulted in the prefix — which was intended to be “internal” —  being advertised externally. This is an issue because the “route-type internal” match in JunOS or JunOS EVO (the operating systems used by HPE Juniper Networks devices) will match any non-external route type, such as Internal BGP (IBGP) routes, which is what happened here.\n\nAs a result, all IPv6 prefixes that Cloudflare redistributes internally across the backbone were accepted by this policy, and advertised to all our BGP neighbors in Miami. This is unfortunately very similar to the outage we experienced in 2020, on which you can \n\nWhen the policy misconfiguration was applied at 20:25 UTC, a series of unintended BGP updates were sent from AS13335 to peers and providers in Miami. These BGP updates are viewable historically by looking at MRT files with the monocle tool or using RIPE BGPlay.\n\nIn the monocle output seen above, we have the timestamp of our BGP update, followed by the next-hop in the announcement, the ASN of the network feeding a given route-collector, the prefix involved, and the AS path and BGP communities if any are found. At the end of the output per-line, we also find the route-collector instance.\n\nLooking at the first update for prefix 2a03:2880:f077::/48, the AS path is 64112 22850 174 3356 13335 32934. This means we (AS13335) took the prefix received from Meta (AS32934), our peer, and then advertised it toward Lumen (AS3356), one of our upstream transit providers. We know this is a route leak as routes received from peers are only meant to be readvertised to downstream (customer) networks, not laterally to other peers or up to providers.\n\nAs a result of the leak and the forwarding of unintended traffic into our Miami router from providers and peers, we experienced congestion on our backbone between Miami and Atlanta, as you can see in the graph below.\n\nThis would have resulted in elevated loss for some Cloudflare customer traffic, and higher latency than usual for traffic traversing these links. In addition to this congestion, the networks whose prefixes we leaked would have had their traffic discarded by firewall filters on our routers that are designed to only accept traffic for Cloudflare services and our customers. At peak, we discarded around 12Gbps of traffic ingressing our router in Miami for these non-downstream prefixes.\n\nWe are big supporters and active contributors to efforts within the IETF and infrastructure community that strengthen routing security. We know firsthand how easy it is to cause a route leak accidentally, as evidenced by this incident.\n\nPreventing route leaks will require a multi-faceted approach, but we have identified multiple areas in which we can improve, both short- and long-term.\n\nIn terms of our routing policy configurations and automation, we are:\n\nPatching the failure in our routing policy automation that caused the route leak, and will mitigate this potential failure and others like it immediately\n\nImplementing additional BGP community-based safeguards in our routing policies that explicitly reject routes that were received from providers and peers on external export policies\n\nAdding automatic routing policy evaluation into our CI/CD pipelines that looks specifically for empty or erroneous policy terms\n\nImprove early detection of issues with network configurations and the negative effects of an automated change\n\nTo help prevent route leaks in general, we are:\n\nValidating routing equipment vendors' implementation of RFC9234 (BGP roles and the Only-to-Customer Attribute) in preparation for our rollout of the feature, which is the only way independent of routing policy to prevent route leaks caused at the local Autonomous System (AS)\n\nEncouraging the long term adoption of RPKI Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA), where networks could automatically reject routes that contain anomalous AS paths\n\nMost importantly, we would again like to apologize for the impact we caused users and customers of Cloudflare, as well as any impact felt by external networks.",

    "description": "Apply to our rolling effort to find, scope, and build the most important projects to prepare the world for advanced AI",
    "fullText": "In 2025, IFP published The Launch Sequence, a set of proposals aimed at answering one question: what does America need to build, which will not be built fast enough by default, to prepare for a future with advanced AI?\n\nAs we explained in the foreword to the collection, Preparing for Launch, we need to solve two broad problems:\n\nWe invited some of the sharpest thinkers, engineers, and scientists thinking about these topics to write 16 concrete proposals to address these problems.\n\nSince then, many of the proposals have gained real-world traction:5\n\nMajor new funding is flowing into this space. The OpenAI Foundation committed $25 billion to AI resilience and curing diseases. The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative is refocusing most of its philanthropic spending on AI projects to “cure all disease.” The White House launched the Genesis Mission, a “national effort to unleash a new age of AI‑accelerated innovation and discovery.” Philanthropies and government officials are asking us for more ideas about where this money should be directed.\n\nThis is a momentous opportunity, and how well these funds are spent will depend both on the quality of available ideas and on teams being ready to implement them.\n\nThat’s why The Launch Sequence is transitioning into a rolling effort to:\n\nThe output of The Launch Sequence will be a collection of thoroughly vetted, detailed project plans for philanthropists to fund or for policymakers to implement.7\n\nWe’re excited to announce our official Advisory Panel for the project, including:\n\nWe are seeking initial short pitches (around 200–400 words) that address one of the three focus areas of this RFP: accelerating science, strengthening security, and adapting institutions. See “Ideas we are interested in” at the bottom of this post for full descriptions of these focus areas.\n\nWe are interested in projects that are particularly important to achieve in light of rapid advances in AI. This means that the capabilities of advanced AI — or the changes such capabilities will bring — should be a key part of either the problem or the solution.8 If you are unsure if a proposal is in-scope, we encourage you to submit it anyway.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of the kinds of project ideas we’re excited about can be found at the bottom of this post. You can also see the project ideas we’ve already published on our website: ifp.org/launch.\n\nWe welcome pitches from two broad groups of contributors:\n\nWe are especially interested in pitches from people who would consider implementing their proposal themselves.10 This is not a requirement; we are also interested in hearing from strategists, researchers, and domain experts who can articulate what technologies or projects should exist, even if they are not the ones to build them. We also offer a $1,000 bounty for successful referrals — if you know someone who might be interested in being an author, please share this page with them and ask them to include your name in the application form. If their proposal is accepted, you’ll receive the bounty.\n\nWe expect authoring full Launch Sequence project plans to take 8–14 weeks from accepted pitch to published piece, involving several stages of writing, receiving feedback from IFP and input from external experts, and refining your full project plan.\n\nIFP is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and will have no claim over any IP related to your idea, nor ownership of any resulting companies. We aim to accelerate authors and builders.\n\nIf you have an idea, we want to hear it. You can learn more and submit an idea via the form below.\n\nThis is a rolling RFP with no submission deadline, but we encourage you to submit a pitch early (within the next few weeks), as we will prioritize early submissions and start reviewing immediately.\n\nQuestions? Email launch.sequence@ifp.org\n\nWe are interested in rapidly building what we need to prepare for a world with advanced AI so that we can fully reap AI’s benefits while managing its new threats. Such an agenda will include a wide-ranging set of projects, including creating companies, tools, technologies, institutions, research streams, resources, and public policies.\n\nWe will only consider projects that address a market failure (or policy gap) and will therefore not be built by default, or not quickly enough. The three core categories where we expect these issues to surface are in accelerating science, strengthening security, and adapting key institutions.\n\nThe lists below are not meant to be exhaustive. Instead, they are meant to illustrate the kinds of projects that we would be excited to support. We encourage you to submit pitches for projects whether or not they are listed below.\n\nWhat resources, technologies, or institutions will scientists need to unlock breakthroughs with AI and other emerging technologies, and which aren’t being created fast enough through market forces or traditional grant funding?\n\nAI promises to transform how science is done. But leveraging AI advances for breakthroughs requires more than capable models. It requires infrastructure, institutions, and resources that no single lab or company has an incentive to build: shared datasets, standardized protocols, access to physical experimentation capacity, and new modes of peer review and validation. Traditional grant funding moves too slowly and often rewards the wrong things; private industry optimizes for what can become profitable, not what will most advance scientific progress. Without targeted investment and effort by the US government and philanthropies, scientific bottlenecks will limit AI-accelerated discovery even as the models improve. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nHealth and biology. The highest ambition for AI may be to generate cures to inherited and infectious diseases. But even as AI companies pursue this goal, their efforts alone are unlikely to fully accomplish it: biology is immensely complex, wet lab work is messy and reliant on tacit knowledge, and treatments require extensive clinical trials and regulation before they can even start to be distributed to patients. And even if current technologies eventually scale to this lofty goal, delays, even on the order of years, will have massive life-altering costs for billions of people and avoidable suffering at scale. Moving faster, even to achieve the same outcome, can save millions of lives.\n\nWe are interested in proposals that offer ways to speed up biological research, decrease the time between a treatment’s discovery and its real-world availability, or create the policy entrepreneurship needed to massively improve healthspan around the world.\n\nNovel infrastructure for the scientific process. AI tools are being developed to increase productivity in every industry, science included. However, while commercial interests are rapidly building AI tools for materials or drug discovery, efforts to improve the basic scientific process have received comparatively less attention. We are interested in “horizontal” infrastructure that improves the scientific process itself across fields. Projects to build better tooling for natural and physical sciences include:\n\nMetascience. Scientists spend a great deal of time on the work that surrounds the research enterprise — developing systems to durably maintain and share data, writing and reviewing proposals, and interacting with their supporting and partner institutions. Each of these areas of work is already being transformed by AI, but conventional grants and institutions are slow to catch up. Efforts to reimagine how institutions should adapt to the age of AI include:\n\nOther potential directions. The above categories are non-exhaustive. We would also like to receive proposals for other scientific research directions, such as physics, chemistry, or ecology, or proposals that direct other unmet needs in the research, development, and innovation ecosystem.\n\nWhat tools, technologies, or institutions can we build to ensure rapid AI advances do not undermine national security or public safety?\n\nAI technologies are dual-use. The same capabilities that automate cyberdefense can automate cyberattacks; and the tools that accelerate progress in the life sciences may also reduce the barriers to engineer biological weapons. Furthermore, the transformative potential of AI raises the stakes of geopolitical competition, and strengthens the ability of state and non-state actors to cause widespread and asymmetric harm. No one actor bears these risks, requiring targeted philanthropic and government action to ensure that defenses can scale alongside AI capabilities. We are particularly interested in achieving a world in which defensive technologies are structurally advantaged, such that attacks are quickly detected and contained. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nCyber defense. The integration of AI into cyber and cyber-physical systems introduces a broad range of vulnerabilities that hinder AI adoption and increase the attack surface for critical infrastructure. Moreover, AI is already increasing the speed and scale of cyber attacks. By proactively investing in security and leveraging AI for defense, we can enhance our resilience. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nBiological defense. Advances in AI and biotechnology are removing barriers to the development and design of biological weapons, which could cause millions of deaths and trillions in economic damage. How can we prevent the worst outcomes without slowing down beneficial research? Potential projects in this space include:\n\nVerification and evaluation. AI challenges traditional technology-policy frameworks because it lacks many of the typical characteristics they address, like concrete physical forms, easily isolated components, and straightforward version control. To mitigate these problems, we need new methods for the verification of pertinent AI system characteristics (e.g., proving that certain data was used to train a model) and the measurement science of AI system capabilities and propensities (e.g., determining whether a benchmark accurately the risk-relevant properties it claims to). At the same time, these methods will not be effective if they leak or extract other critical information from the systems they are probing. Well-designed and privacy-preserving tools of this kind can enable a world in which governments can trust industry to manage this technology, and nations can credibly signal that their AI capabilities do not pose threats to international security. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nAlignment and control. AI systems demonstrate sophisticated, unintended behaviors as well as the capacity to evade human oversight. As AI agents take on more and more consequential tasks and play a greater role in our personal lives, the risks from alignment and control failures increase. These dangers could compound significantly as coding agents become more integral to AI development. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nOther potential directions. The former categories are not an exhaustive list of ideas we are interested in. Some other promising areas we would like to receive proposals for include:\n\nWhat tools, technologies, organizations, or policies are needed to help society adapt to rapid AI-driven change while preserving human agency, individual freedoms, and democratic institutions?\n\nThe development of advanced AI would alter the very foundations of social and economic life. Translating AI’s potential into widespread flourishing requires forward-looking institutions12 and infrastructure — technological, organizational, and governmental — that can establish shared facts, coordinate at scale, and make rapid, well-informed decisions. Yet most existing systems were not built for the speed and complexity that AI enables, and markets lack the incentives to update some of these systems for this new reality. Below are non-exhaustive problem areas for which we are excited to receive submissions.\n\nIncreasing state capacity. Governments are slow-moving institutions, but it is imperative for them to respond quickly and competently to rapid AI progress. In a world of rapidly advancing AI, the US government has a crucial role to play as an enforcer of law and order, provider of public goods, and the R&D lab of the world.\n\nEpistemic integrity. AI dramatically lowers the cost of generating large volumes of apparently high-quality content, straining our ability to distinguish facts from fiction or propaganda. However, new infrastructure designed to establish ground truths, incorporate a variety of viewpoints in well-organized discussions, and analyze large amounts of data can create a more dynamic marketplace of ideas than ever before. We should be wary of interventions that give any one person, company, or interest group the power to adjudicate what is true and what isn’t — distributed solutions like Community Notes could instead provide less-brittle alternatives. Potential projects in this space include:\n\nCoordination. The costs of coordination — identifying counterparties, becoming informed, negotiating priorities and agreements, and ensuring adherence to terms — mean that many mutually beneficial agreements between people in the world never actually get made. Likewise, the cost of coordination hinders many individuals’ ability to participate in the governance decisions that affect their lives. AI could greatly reduce the costs of coordination, enabling individuals to reach positive-sum outcomes and directly participate in governance at unprecedented scale.\n\nBuilding resources to maintain human agency. In recent history, people have maintained economic and political power because they were needed as workers, taxpayers, soldiers, and voters whose cooperation institutions depended on. As advanced AI automates increasingly large parts of the economy, the risk goes beyond broad unemployment — it’s that as people lose economic leverage, their institutional leverage will suffer too. If institutions can function without broad human participation, they may become less responsive to human needs. Markets and governments will likely produce some tools for adaptation, but may do so unevenly or too slowly to keep pace with AI progress. We’re interested in projects that help people maintain economic relevance and institutional leverage even as advanced AI automates large parts of the workforce.\n\nWe believe this effort is critical, but we are unsure as to what the most promising proposals in this area may be. Proposals in this category should make an especially strong case for why markets or other institutions won’t provide the solution fast enough by default. Possible proposals in this area include concrete programs to help people rapidly adapt their skills; human-in-the-loop tooling to enable workers to efficiently supervise, direct, and collaborate with AI systems at machine speed; and benefits-sharing programs or policies to ensure the broad automation of labor benefits the general population.\n\nOther potential directions. The above categories are not an exhaustive list of ideas we are interested in. Some other promising areas we would like to receive proposals for include:\n\nAcknowledgements: Thank you to Gaurav Sett, Non-Resident Fellow at IFP, for closely consulting on this piece.\n\nMore details under “Who should submit a pitch?”\n\nAI could unlock treatments to the most debilitating human diseases. But some of these fundamental breakthroughs will lack clear commercial incentives or face other barriers. If AI greatly accelerates science, unaddressed bottlenecks will become especially acute, and proactively eliminating these bottlenecks will become especially important.\n\nAI could unlock treatments to the most debilitating human diseases. But some of these fundamental breakthroughs will lack clear commercial incentives or face other barriers. If AI greatly accelerates science, unaddressed bottlenecks will become especially acute, and proactively eliminating these bottlenecks will become especially important.\n\nWe also submitted these proposals to the American Science Acceleration Project RFI, bound them into a beautiful book, and are sending copies to all 535 offices in Congress.\n\nSubmissions to the FDA for drug approval, which collectively form one of the most exhaustive repositories of real-world scientific practice and regulatory negotiation ever assembled, and thus a rich resource for AI to be trained on.\n\nWhile the original Launch Sequence proposals were primarily aimed at the US government, we’re broadening our focus to include projects that can move forward just with philanthropic support. Given our new focus on providing shovel-ready ideas for funders, we will dedicate many more resources to vetting and refining project proposals than we did in the past.\n\nStill, the US government can play a powerful role in implementing many proposals at scale, and we are excited to support proposals that require or benefit from government action.\n\nThis should be interpreted broadly, for example: a pitch for an organization to manufacture next-gen personal protective equipment (PPE) to increase society’s resilience against pandemics would be in scope. This is because future AI may democratize access to the knowledge and tools needed to create engineered viruses, thus increasing our baseline pandemic risk.\n\nExamples with links to existing Launch Sequence project plans:\n\n1. Cases where AI creates/worsens a problem (e.g., biosecurity, offensive cybersecurity, AI sleeper agents, securing AI model weights)\n\n2. Cases where AI can be/support the solution (e.g., automating scientific replication, pathogen detection via metagenomics and ML, AI-powered code refactoring)\n\n3. Cases where AI makes something newly feasible, which will not be done fast enough by default (connectome mapping, self-driving labs)\n\nNote: You will be eligible for this bounty if: (1) we first learn about a particular project idea based on your pitch, and (2) you selected “I just want to submit an idea” in the application form, and (3) we then publish a full project plan based on your initial pitch.\n\nWe will ultimately determine whether we had already considered a project idea, or whether your pitch was the first time we encountered it. Only one person will be eligible for the “idea scout bounty” for every piece we publish.\n\nIf you're proposing a new research group or institution, we are excited to help accelerate the potential founder. If you're proposing a government program, we are excited to make the right connections and help the author make it happen.\n\nWe’ll aim to respond to initial pitches within a few weeks of submission, to allow time for us to investigate the area and consult with our advisors and domain experts.\n\n“Institutions” in this RFP should be interpreted broadly, as “the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social interaction.”",

    "fullText": "Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday.\n\nMany modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.\n\nBut, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.\n\nThe case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.\n\nApart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.\n\n“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”",

    "fullText": "CVE-2026-0915: GNU C Library Fixes A Security Issue Present Since 1996\n\nCVE-2026-0915 was published on Friday as a security issue with the GNU C Library \"glibc\" for code introduced 30 years ago. The latest Glibc Git code is now patched for this issue introduced in 1996.\r\nThe oss-security bulletin sums up the issue as the getnetbyaddr and getnetbyaddr_r functions leaking the stack contents to the DNS resovler. It does note though that it is rare to call these APIs with a network value of zero and for an attacker to take advantage of this issue it can only leak the adjacent stack. The loss of confidentiality is ultimately limited but could be used to help in an address space layout randomization (ASLR) bypass. Thankfully at least the scope is rather limited and should ultimately have minimal impact but rather surprising it took 30 years for a zero value case to be tested and in turn properly handled by this very important library.\r\nThe NSS DNS back-end is now fixed in Glibc as it turns out a network value of zero was never tested and can result in the DNS query being constructed from uninitialized stack bytes. With the newest Glibc code, a default query is now constructed for cases where the default network value is zero.\r\nThe issue is fixed by this Git commit now in glibc.git. The problematic code introduced this problem happened all the way back in June 1996.\r\nCVE-2026-0861 was also disclosed this week for Glibc where passing too large of an alignment to glibc's memalign functions could result in an integer overflow and in turn heap corruption. At least that problematic code was only introduced back in 2019 and is also now fixed in Glibc Git.\r\nGlibc 2.43 is expected to be released by early February as the next scheduled update to the GNU C Library.\n\n 38 Comments",

    "description": "The company is also currently facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California for deceptive marketing about Autopilot's capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Tesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\n\nThe decision comes as the company faces a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in its largest U.S. market, California. A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.\n\nAutopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves.\n\nTesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.\n\nThe decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.\n\nMusk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.\n\nTesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. \n\nTesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant’s then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.\n\nAcross the decade-plus of Autopilot’s existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software’s capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",

    "description": "How We Hacked TikTok SEO and Got the AI to Recommend Our Product, After Failing to Go Viral",
    "fullText": "I originally got interested in TikTok for one simple reason: Everywhere I looked, founders were saying it was working.\n\nFounders were growing like crazy and getting traction there. So I decided to try it myself and see if there was something real underneath the hype.\n\nThe product we ran this with was AIFlyer.ai.\n\nAIFlyer is an AI design tool that helps people create flyers, social posts, and simple marketing visuals in seconds. It’s a general utility product. More consumer and SMB than enterprise. That context matters because a lot of what I’m about to share probably won’t work if you’re selling complex B2B software to a narrow ICP.\n\nThis post isn’t a guide on everything we tried. We tried a lot of things that didn’t work. I’ll focus on the only thing that worked, and why it worked. I’m happy to answer questions in the comments if you want to go deeper.\n\nLike most people, our first instinct was influencers, just find people in that niche, and leverage their audience. But we failed, for several reasons.\n\nOne big reason was the budget. Influencer marketing only really works when you can place many bets. You need enough volume to discover the 10% of creators that will drive 90% of results. That usually means spending $10k–$15k a month just on experimentation and wasting 90% of the budget in the first couple of months. I couldn’t afford that luxury.\n\nSo we tried what most early founders do. We placed one or two bets and hoped we’d get lucky and we didn’t. Even when one video went viral, the ROI to paid was zero. Out of curiosity, I cross-referenced one of the creators with another YC founder to see if the post they made for them worked. Same story there.\n\nWe even tried bringing an influencer in-house for $1,000 a month to post once daily. The average video got about 200 views, and there were no breakouts. We also tried Whop and clipping, too, and it didn’t really help.\n\nEventually, we copied a carousel concept we saw from another brand that was basically like a meme. It had 157k views.\n\nMassive engagement. And absolutely nothing happened to our business.\n\nVirality is its own game. You’re either great at it or terrible at it, and luck plays a huge role.\n\nViral entertainment content doesn’t reliably convert, especially if it doesn’t map to intent.\n\nOne thing we did early that ended up mattering a lot was adding a simple “How did you find us?” question during signup.\n\nThis gave us a baseline. If TikTok showed up consistently as a source, we’d keep going. If not, we’d kill it. That decision alone probably saved us months of guessing.\n\nOne day, I noticed something strange. A post that had completely flopped on day one, ~100 views, started climbing. A week later, it was at ~2,000 views.\n\nThat wasn’t normal, so I checked the analytics.\n\nAlmost 98% of the traffic came from search, not the For You Page (The feed curated by the TikTok algorithm where most viral videos get their views from).\n\nThat’s when it hit me: some people are using TikTok like Google.\n\nThat one post started bringing in ~20 signups and the occasional paid subscription every couple of weeks. Not huge, but real.\n\nThat one post changed how we thought about the platform. Some people also use TikTok the same way they use Google. They search with intent.\n\nWe started looking up keywords relevant to us and creating carousel posts specifically for them. Since we were building a design tool, this was straightforward. We’d write the content for the carousel post, then use AIFlyer to generate the designs for the carousel.\n\nThe next week, we had our next “viral” hit. But again, almost all the views came from search. Around 96% of traffic was from people actively looking for something.\n\nWe started looking up keywords relevant to us and creating carousel posts specifically for them. Since we were building a design tool, this was straightforward. We’d write the content for the carousel post, then use AIFlyer to generate the designs for the carousel.\n\nThe next week, we had our next “viral” hit. But again, almost all the views came from search. Around 96% of traffic was from people actively looking for something.\n\nThis time, the conversion was noticeably better.\n\nA keyword like “How to make a flyer on iPhone” isn’t entertainment. It’s intent. This is the same type of keyword people fight over with SEO and pay top dollar for on Google Ads. On TikTok, it was free.\n\nAll we needed was a relevant carousel that subtly showed our product solving the problem.\n\nThe beautiful thing about these posts is that they don’t need to win on day one, compared to viral videos where the video will max out in a week, and once that trend is gone, you have to start hunting for the next miracle.\n\nMost of the screenshots I shared above had 100–300 views on the first day. Then they slowly accumulated views every day as people searched for that keyword.\n\nWhen you build a library of these posts, each serving a specific search intent, it starts to compound.\n\nAt some point, something even crazier happened.\n\nTikTok’s AI started mentioning us in the LLM response.\n\nA friend sent me a screenshot where TikTok’s LLM answered a query and mentioned AIFlyer right after Canva. We hadn’t optimized for this. We didn’t even know it was happening. The model was just pulling from our content and sending people our way.\n\nThat was when it clicked that we weren’t just posting content anymore. We were feeding a system.\n\nOnce we understood the pattern, the next step was obvious.\n\nI built a small AI agent that used the prompts we had manually used to generate all the contents for the carousels that worked, generated content across multiple relevant topics, used AIFlyer to create the designs with templates that converted via function calling, and automated posting.\n\nWe ran ten accounts, posting four times a day. TikTok’s automation API doesn’t allow adding sound, so I assumed this would fail but on average the posts did 4 times better on day 1 than what we had an undergrad student create the contents manually.\n\nAt that point, the math became interesting.\n\nWhat does this look like when you have 1,000 posts per account, each serving a different search keyword, across ten accounts?

    "fullText": "The post Alaskan Moose Tower Over Grizzlies In Rare Wilderness Footage appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nConfronting a 1,808-pound Alaskan Yukon moose requires grizzlies to prioritize safety over apex dominance.\n\nAn 80-inch antler span creates a physical constraint that prohibits grizzlies from engaging in close-quarter combat.\n\n700-pound bears are often physically outmatched by the largest deer species on Earth.\n\nScouting the summer salmon runs at Brooks River is necessary to witness this specific predatory avoidance behavior.\n\nGrizzly bears are one of the few apex predators. They’re at the top of the food chain and will attack almost anything if they’re hungry enough. Brown bears are also known to be incredibly territorial. They share the wilderness with other animals, such as cougars, birds, coyotes, and more.\n\nA real wilderness location, Katmai National Park and Preserve, is located about 260 miles southwest of Anchorage. The Valley of 10,000 Smokes’ surreal volcanic beauty attracts some visitors, but bears are the main draw.\n\nThe park is home to over 2,200 brown bears, many of whom concentrate on the Brooks River to gorge on the summer salmon runs, making it one of the greatest places in Alaska to see bears. A YouTube channel by the name “Bradjosephs” was visiting the area when he saw something peculiar.\n\nMultiple bears were foraging by the river, looking for fresh salmon to eat. In the distant meadow, a giant moose appears. Even though bears are territorial, they’ll rarely attack a moose. It’s too dangerous, even for a wild animal as ferocious as a grizzly.\n\nThe two animals walk almost side-by-side at one point, giving us viewers an idea of just how big the moose is. The average grizzly bear weighs around 700 pounds. Males can weigh anywhere between 400 and 790 pounds, making them heavier than females. A big female might weigh anything between 290 and 400 pounds.\n\nThat’s huge! Grizzly bears are one of the largest land animals alive today. But as we can see in this footage, they look like teddy bears next to the gorgeous Alaskan moose. Female small-sized moose can weigh up to 800 pounds. Males of this size can weigh up to 1,600 pounds and grow as tall as about 6 feet.\n\nIt’s not unheard of for a bear to attack a moose, but the teddies in this video know better. They have plenty of fish to snack on while letting the moose safely pass by. It’s also not uncommon for moose to kill bears.\n\nMoose have been known to gore bears with their antlers, trample them underfoot, or rake them with their hooves. Moose are not hostile creatures. However, they still pose a threat. They will protect themselves if threatened. Grizzlies and polar bears are often not killed by moose, but they can cause significant harm to wolves, black bears, and coyotes, which are smaller prey.\n\nMoose and bears have the capacity to be deadly to people, depending on the circumstances. However, because they are predators, whereas moose are not, bears tend to be more dangerous. If you ever find yourself in a situation like this one, be sure to keep a safe distance from any wild animal.\n\nYes, bears normally stay away from fully-grown moose. Moose have very large antlers, and they can easily tear a grizzly bear apart, so bears usually leave moose alone. If it came to a fight, a grizzly bear would probably win, but it would be a tough fight, and the bear is smart enough to avoid it. See our article about this situation: Moose vs Bear: Who Would Win in a Fight?\n\nHowever, bears are commonly known to attack moose calves below the age of two months, as they do not have full-grown antlers to defend themselves.\n\nDuring the spring season, when grizzly bears just come out of hibernation, they are known to ignore their own instincts and attack an isolated moose or two.\n\nMoose in the wild typically have a lifespan of about 10-20 years. Bears, on the other hand, can live for much longer and may even reach 30 years old in some cases. The main threats to their survival are human activities such as hunting and habitat destruction due to deforestation or urbanization.\n\nOther natural predators also pose risks, especially for young moose or bear cubs, which are more vulnerable to predation than adults. Both species must also contend with environmental factors, such as harsh winters that can lead to malnutrition and disease, which can shorten their lives if not properly managed.\n\nIt’s no wonder grizzlies hesitate to take on a full-grown moose – they are gigantic! The Alaskan Yukon moose, the largest subspecies, can grow to a massive 1,808 pounds, stand up to 7.7 feet tall, and sport antlers more than 80 inches across. The height of a moose is measured at the shoulder – so its hoof-to-antler height could easily reach 10 feet! East Siberian moose are only slightly smaller – tipping the scales at 1,600 pounds.\n\nMoose are the largest species of deer, with an average Yellowstone bull standing over 6 feet tall and weighing around 1,000 pounds. Females are slightly smaller and tend to weigh around 800. So, even when considering the average-sized moose and the average-sized 500-pound grizzly – it’s easy to see why the typically lazy bear would hold off on such a risky, demanding fight. Only the hungriest grizzly eating for hibernation would even consider such – much less act on it.\n\nThe post Alaskan Moose Tower Over Grizzlies In Rare Wilderness Footage appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

I really enjoyed his talk at Davos and found what he said on humanoid robots quite interesting.\n\nMy prediction is there'll be there'll be more robots than people. Probably sometime next year. I'd say that by the by the end of next year, I I think uh we'd be selling humanoid robots uh to the public.\n\nA new Gartner report this week sheds light on what's coming on the humanoid front potentially. Through 2028, uh less than 100 companies will progress humanoid robot proofs of concept beyond experimentation with fewer than 20 companies going live in production for supply chain and manufacturing use cases. My question is this, should we believe humanoids will be the next great investment opportunity. After all, there is an AI component to these bots. Stephanie, what say you?\n\nAh, it's from a personal perspective, it's a little bit scary. I have to say, but um, it is something that we have been considering in Robin Hood strategies, for example, where we haven't necessarily been looking for companies to invest in that have humanoids in their, uh, you know, in their pipeline, but we have been investing in companies that will provide the eyes and the ears for robots because even if it doesn't end up being a humanoid, I do think this concept of automation replacing humans in some way shape\n\nor form is not going away. That's going to be a growing concept. Um, and so that's where we've been focusing.\n\nAnd as I don't know why I think this, but I think you'd be an earlier uh an early adopter of one of these humanoids in your house.\n\nI would definitely be an earlier adopter.\n\nSee, I know. See, you work with someone long enough, you kind of just know, you know.\n\nMaybe for the yard. But not right now. Oh, for sure, for for everything in the house. Uh, yeah, can the humanoid clean? Oh, sure.\n\nAnd your Costco pizzas. It can make those Costco pizzas for you.\n\nCan can they cook for me? Yeah, of course. Uh I'd be a huge early adopter for humanoid robots and also the robot taxis as well. Uh but look, this year and next year and going forward, it is uh we are starting to see sort of the merging of machinery which has been around, but also now you're adding on the AI layer, the intelligence layer. And that is what's most exciting when talking about humanoid robots in in the future.\n\nAll right, so I got it right with Ines. Brooke, I'm going to guess that you're a little skeptical on the on these humanoids.\n\nBrian, I'm the youngest here and I'm skeptical. I don't think I'd want one of these in my house.\n\nYeah, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\n\nI think certainly for sure, when when you think about uh the future where this is going. Elon Musk is pretty convincing. He was saying that a lot of his parent- a lot of his friends rather have elderly parents. This was in the conversation at Davos with Larry Fink. A lot of his uh friends have elderly parents and he believes that these humanoid robots will help to take care of an aging population. I thought that was an interesting point. I personally, I love interpersonal relationships. I love, you know, talking to people. I love being the one to sort of\n\njump in. And so I I will say, I'm not bought yet, but if this is anything like uh how Disney Channel's uh The Smart House went, then we're in for something certainly that might be a little scary here. And so, I'm a bit skeptical here, Brian.\n\nAll right, well I will leave it on this. I know my mom is a big opening bid watcher each day. Mom, I will say this to you right to the camera. I'm going to buy one of these robots early to take care of you at some point because look, not to be mean, I I just don't have the time. Sorry mom.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump lashed out at Gavin Newsom for spoiling his appearance at the Davos, Switzerland, summit this week.\n\nThe California governor attended the forum, spending his time criticizing the president and his administration while urging allies to “stand united.” At one point, the 58-year-old claimed he was denied entry into the U.S. hub.\n\nNewsom looked on as Trump addressed political and business leaders on Wednesday, then criticized the president’s “boring, and at times boorish,” speech.\n\n“It was insignificant in its insignificance. He said what we all knew: that he’s not going to invade Greenland,” he told The Guardian.\n\nTrump, who has backed down from his threat of military invasion and tariffs on other European nations, still couldn’t seem to get over Newsom’s appearance.\n\n“Gavin Newscum, as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State, should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders, and embarrassing our Country,“ Trump, 79, grumbled on Truth Social. “He made a mockery of himself, and everybody, including his staff, knows it!”\n\nTrump went on to attack the governor, who is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2028, on California-specific issues.\n\n“With a record like he’s got,” Trump concluded, “the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth, where people are leaving in droves, it is unimaginable that he could run for President but, who knows, it’s a very strange World!”\n\nNewsom, 58, responded succinctly to Trump’s 158-word attack.\n\nNewsom also took shots at Trump’s backers who followed the president’s lead in criticizing him.\n\nWhen radio host Bill Mitchell captioned a photo of Newsom, “That look you have when you’re not winning and you know it,” the Democrat fired back: “That look when every MAGA doormat can’t stop talking about you.”\n\nIt was only a matter of time before White House Communications Director Steven Cheung got involved.\n\nCheung, who recently went after Newsom for criticizing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and world leaders at Davos who suck up to Trump, gave his own caption of Newsom’s photo.\n\n“The look of someone who realizes they’re at the point of no return and giving up control to others is the only way to satisfy his home life,” he wrote on X.\n\nThe Newsom bashing continued into the night on Fox News.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did some pearl-clutching about Newsom selling kneepads with Trump’s signature, Katie Miller, the wife of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, suggested that there was a large amount of voting and welfare fraud happening in his state, and complained that Newsom “still hasn’t turned over his voter rolls or welfare list to us.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Newsom’s office and the White House for comment.\n\nPreviously, the White House told the Daily Beast, “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.”",

He wrote that he had no idea she had been dating anyone. When he asked how long they had been together, she became evasive and irritated.\n\nThe following day, he contacted one of her friends to ask about the boyfriend. The friend said the boyfriend had been mostly unemployed for more than two years and struggled to keep jobs. She also said he moved into the sister's apartment after about a month of dating and had been living there for roughly four months. After that conversation, he viewed the situation differently.\n\nAfter learning when the boyfriend moved in, the OP said his sister's increased money requests matched that period. As a result, he believed he had been covering rent for an apartment where another adult was living without paying toward it.\n\nWhen he raised the issue with his sister, she said she hadn't mentioned the relationship because it was \"still developing.\" He then set new limits, saying he would stop covering half the rent since she now had a roommate, continue paying utilities, and reduce extra cash.\n\nTrending: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nWhen he suggested that the boyfriend help cover expenses, his sister said he did not have a job, and he responded that it was time for him to start looking for one.

    "description": "The 44-year-old Canadian was added to the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Ryan Wedding, the former Olympic snowboarder who was wanted by the FBI for allegedly running a violent transnational drug trafficking organization, has been arrested, the Justice Department announced on Friday.\n\nWedding, 44, was added to the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list in March.\n\n“At my direction, @FBI agents have apprehended yet another member of the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted List: Ryan Wedding, the onetime Olympian snowboarder-turned alleged violent cocaine kingpin,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X.\n\nWedding was taken into custody in Mexico City on Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel at a news conference at Ontario International Airport in Southern California. He was flown to the United States from Mexico, where U.S. authorities believe he had been living for more than a decade.\n\nPatel compared Wedding to infamous drug kingpins Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.\n\n\"Just to tell you how bad of a guy Ryan Wedding is, he went from an Olympic snowboarder to the largest narco trafficker in modern times,\" Patel said. “He is a modern-day El Chapo. He is a modern-day Pablo Escobar. He thought he could evade justice.”\n\nCiting a Mexican law enforcement official, the Associated Press reported that Wedding turned himself in at the U.S. embassy. Patel would not comment on the details of his apprehension.\n\n“Ryan Wedding is now in United States custody,” Bill Essayli, assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said in a post on X. “He will face the full force of justice for his charges.”\n\nAkil Davis, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said that Wedding would be held over the weekend and is slated to have his initial court appearance on Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a federal indictment that was unsealed in November, Wedding was charged with nine counts, including conspiracy to distribute, possess and export cocaine, conspiracy to commit murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise, witness tampering and money laundering, among other crimes.\n\nU.S. prosecutors allege that Wedding’s drug trafficking network regularly shipped hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico and Southern California to Canada and locations in the United States. Wedding was also accused of orchestrating multiple murders as part of these drug crimes.\n\nWedding, whose aliases include “El Jefe,” “Giant” and “Public Enemy,” represented his home country, Canada, during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. He competed in the parallel giant slalom and finished in 24th place.\n\n“Wedding went from shredding powder on the slopes at the Olympics to distributing powder cocaine on the streets of U.S. cities and in his native Canada,” Davis said in a statement when he was added to the most wanted list. “The alleged murders of his competitors make Wedding a very dangerous man.”\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials had said that they believed Wedding was living in Mexico under the protection of the Sinaloa drug cartel.\n\nThe U.S. State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs initially offered a $10 million reward for information that could lead to Wedding’s capture. That award was raised to $15 million in November.\n\nThe same month, the Justice Department announced 10 related arrests as part of what officials dubbed “Operation Giant Slalom.” As part of the operation, Smith said that the FBI seized a Mercedes Benz worth an estimated $15 million, dozens of motorcycles, jewelry and artwork.\n\nWedding and his co-conspirators are accused of posting a photograph of a murder witness on a Canadian website called The Dirty News so he could be identified. The man was shot and killed in a restaurant in Medellín, Colombia, in January.\n\nPatel said that another fugitive on the FBI's most wanted list — Alejandro Castillo, who was captured last week in Mexico — was transported back to the United States on the same plane as Wedding. Castillo is being extradited to North Carolina, where he faces a murder charge in the 2016 death of a woman.\n\nCastillo's arrest in Mexico was unrelated to Wedding's apprehension, Patel said.",

    "fullText": "The post Triple The Weight Of A King Cobra: Meet Greece’s 57-Pound Viper appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nAchieving a 57-pound body mass made this viper the heaviest venomous snake in history.\n\nThe 157-year disappearance of Richard Owen’s research once threatened the legitimacy of this giant species.\n\nThe Laophis crotaloides thrived and grew to massive sizes in cold weather conditions.\n\nAnalyzing the 13 vertebrae found in Greece was necessary to determine this predator’s snake family.\n\nYou probably know that the king cobra is the largest venomous snake known to humans, but what if this isn’t entirely true? It all began in 1857 when British paleontologist Richard Owen discovered 13 fossils that led him to publish his findings of a new species of viper, which he claimed to be the largest ever!\n\nHowever, Owen’s findings got lost in time until 157 years later! A single fossil was rediscovered near Thessaloniki, northern Greece, giving credibility to Richard Owen’s discovery many years before. Discover the largest venomous snake ever. A tip – it’s three times bigger than a king cobra.\n\nIn 1857, Richard Owen, who had coined the word “dinosaur,” described an unbelievable finding. Owen claimed to have found 13 fossil vertebrae of an enormous snake near Thessaloniki, Greece. He named the species Laophis crotaloides.\n\nFrom its fossils, Owen was not only able to determine the snake’s size and weight but also its family. He stated that the Laophis crotaloides was a viper that weighed 57 pounds and measured between 10 and 13 feet in length.\n\nKing cobras, which are currently recognized as the largest venomous snake species, can grow up to 18 feet but hardly exceed 20 pounds in weight. Consequently, it is safe to say that king cobras are close to only a third of Laophis crotaloides’ weight.\n\nLaophis crotaloides lived in Greece (and perhaps other parts of the world) about 4 million years ago. This means that they inhabited areas with grasslands, thick vegetation, and cold weather. Because most snakes today hibernate through winter and come out only when the weather is warm, it is astounding how Laophis crotaloides survived and grew to such size.\n\nLaois crotaloides is an extinct species of snake that lived in Greece (and possibly other parts of the world) around 4 million years ago. The remains of Laois crotaloides were first discovered in Greece in 1857, and since then, there has been further research into its existence and range. Today, it is believed that Laois crotaloides may have also lived outside of Greece during this time period, but due to a lack of evidence, this still remains uncertain.\n\nNot much is known about Laophis crotaloides, and sadly, the single fossil discovered cannot tell us enough to figure out the monster’s venom type. However, we do know that it is a viper and safely assume that it had venom similar to that of many vipers today.\n\nGenerally, vipers have venom composed of enzymatic and nonenzymatic proteins. Usually, their venom attacks tissues and causes death if the venom is strong enough and left untreated. It also causes necrosis and coagulopathy- not to mention the intense pain and swelling that accompany viper bites. They also have long hollow solenoglyphous fangs that allow them to inject their venom like one would use a hypodermic needle.\n\nGeorgios Georgalis, a researcher, believes that these snakes fed very similarly to snakes today. Even though the snake lived among some really large animals, he believed it fed on a diet of small mammals such as rodents. Georgalis presented his findings on the Laophis crotaloides to the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Berlin on November 6, 2014.\n\nWithout a doubt, the Laophis crotaloides is one of the largest venomous snakes ever discovered. You already know how it compares to the king cobra in size. But how does it compare to other snake species?  Let’s take a look at 8 large snake species compared to the Laophis crotaloides.\n\nGarter snakes are harmless snakes. They have venom that is only dangerous to their prey. These snakes are usually medium-sized, measuring between 23 and 30 inches. The largest garter snake ever discovered measured 52.8 inches (4.4 feet). This makes them tiny compared to Laophis crotaloides.\n\nGenerally, garter snakes have easy-going temperaments and are often kept as pets, unlike venomous pit vipers. You can identify these snakes by their varying colors and patterns. They are some of the most beautiful snakes known to man.\n\nTiger rattlesnakes are named for their tiger-like patterns. They are known to be one of the deadliest snakes in Northern America. Tiger rattlesnakes inject only about 11 mg of dried venom in each bite. This is much lower than other snakes.\n\nHowever, it is still life-threatening and capable of killing a person. Despite this, it is still incredibly potent and life-threatening. On average, these snakes measure 24 inches. However, the largest specimen of tiger rattlesnake discovered measured 35.9 inches (3 feet).\n\nHognose snakes are popular for their weird noses and their dramatic attitudes. They are usually sand-brown markings of varying colors. These snakes are nonvenomous and measure 2 to 4 feet on average. They are known to attain a maximum length of 6 feet.\n\nAnacondas are known for their size and length. Consequently, there are several reports that claim to have discovered the largest specimen. However, the largest and most verifiable claim points to a 27.7-foot-long anaconda that weighed over 500 pounds.\n\nBlood pythons are nonvenomous snakes found in various parts of the world. On average, they weigh 4 to 6 pounds. However, the largest blood python ever discovered weighed over 50 pounds and measured about 10 feet.\n\nAccording to the Guinness Book of World Records, a man, identified by only the singular name Rutledge holds the record for the largest eastern diamondback rattlesnake. The snake was caught in 1946 and measured 7 feet, 8 inches, while weighing 34 pounds. On average, eastern diamondbacks weigh 4 to 5 pounds and measure 4 to 5 feet.\n\nWestern diamondback rattlesnakes are some of the most venomous species known to man. They are usually colored with mixtures of brown, yellow, brick red, or yellowish/pinkish-white. On average, these animals measure 4 feet but may reach 5 feet. The largest western diamondback rattlesnake ever discovered was 7 feet and 8 inches in length.\n\nThe largest Burmese python ever discovered was found in the Everglades, Florida. It measured 18 feet, 9 inches, and weighed 104 pounds! It was captured by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission.\n\nBaird’s rat snakes are a type of serpent that can be found in North America. They are medium-sized snakes, usually growing to lengths of between 2 and 5 feet, making them relatively small in comparison to other snake species.\n\nThese snakes are not known for being the largest in their family, but they can still reach impressive sizes, with some individuals measuring up to 25 to 55 inches (64 to 140 cm) in total body length (including tail).\n\nIt is important to note that the largest Baird’s rat snake ever recorded has not been officially documented, so there is no exact data on its size. Hatchlings of Baird’s rat snakes, on the other hand, usually measure 11.8 inches (30 cm) in length on average. In terms of weight, rat snakes are relatively light, with an average weight range of 1.3-4.8 lb (0.6-2.2 kg).\n\nThe post Triple The Weight Of A King Cobra: Meet Greece’s 57-Pound Viper appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A vast network of labor unions, progressive organizations and clergy urged Minnesotans to stay away from work, school and stores Friday to protest immigration enforcement operations, even as subzero temperatures beset the state.\n\nMinneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the Twin Cities for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.\n\nOrganizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses across the state have closed for the day in solidarity with the protest -- from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.\n\n“We’re achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that is mobilizing. The demonstration coincides with a blast of cold air hitting the Upper Midwest and ahead of a severe winter storm that is expected to affect millions.\n\nOn Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative from that of a 5-year-old boy detained by ICE officers in Minneapolis by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.\n\nOn Thursday, a prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people were arrested for their involvement in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a Sunday service at a church in St. Paul. They remained in federal custody Friday morning.\n\nOrganizers hope Friday’s mobilization will be the largest coordinated protest action to date, with a march in downtown Minneapolis planned for Friday afternoon. Earlier Friday, the temperature in Minneapolis was minus 21 with a wind chill of minus 40 (minus 29 Celsius with a wind chill of minus 40 Celsius).\n\nHavelin compared the presence of immigration officers in Minnesota to the winter weather warnings.\n\n“Minnesotans understand that when we’re in a snow emergency … we all have to respond and it makes us do things differently,” she said. “And what’s happening with ICE in our community, in our state, means that we can’t respond as business as usual.”\n\nSomali businesses especially have lost sales during the enforcement surge as workers and customers, fearing detention, stay at home.\n\nMany schools were planning to close Friday, but cited different reasons. The University of Minnesota and the St. Paul public school district said there would be no in-person classes because of the extreme cold. Minneapolis Public Schools were scheduled to be closed “for a teacher record keeping day.”\n\nClergy planned to join the march as well as hold prayer services and fasting, according to a delegation of representatives of faith traditions including Buddhist, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim.\n\nBishop Dwayne Royster, leader of the progressive organization Faith in Action, arrived in Minnesota on Wednesday from Washington, D.C.\n\n“We want ICE out of Minnesota,” he said. “We want them out of all the cities around the country where they’re exercising extreme overreach.”\n\nRoyster said at least 50 of his network’s faith-based organizers were joining the protest. About 10 were traveling from Los Angeles while others from the same group planned a solidarity rally in California, said one of the organizers there.\n\n“It was a very harrowing experience,” said the Rev. Jennifer Gutierrez of the large immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles last year. “We believe God is on the side of migrants.”",

    "description": "As AI threatens jobs, Jamie Dimon joins Elon Musk and Sam Altman on the case for financially supporting workers who are at risk.",
    "fullText": "More than three years after the launch of ChatGPT, anxiety about artificial intelligence in the workplace remains high—especially among Gen Z—as corporate America pushes for higher productivity from leaner workforces. The U.S.’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, is no exception.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the company’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, admitted he’ll likely employ fewer workers in the next five years—but warned that rushing into AI-driven layoffs without safeguards could backfire, potentially triggering “civil unrest.”\n\nInstead, the 69-year-old said he’d even welcome government bans on replacing masses of workers with AI. But before it gets to that stage, he already has ideas up his sleeve to protect some of the 300,000-plus employees on his payroll.\n\n“I have a plan to retrain people, relocate people, income-assist people,” Dimon said.\n\nDimon pointed to the roughly 2-million-strong commercial trucking industry as an example. A sudden shift to fully autonomous trucking, he said, could displace workers who currently earn well into six figures, leaving them struggling to make ends meet.\n\n“Phase it in. Retrain.” he said. “You can’t lay off 2 million truckers tomorrow. You can phase it in over time.”\n\nAnd if that doesn’t suffice and government intervention is needed to prevent companies from cutting jobs too aggressively, Dimon said he would support it—especially if it comes from local incentives.\n\n“We would agree—if we have to do that to save society,” he said. “Society will have more production. We’re going to cure a lot of cancers. You’re not going to slow it down. How do you have plans in place to make it work better if it does something terrible?”\n\nSo far, job cuts directly tied to AI have been limited; in 2025, just 55,000 positions were eliminated as a result of automation—accounting for more than 75% of all AI-related cuts reported since 2023, according to analysis from recruiting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nHowever, AI leaders like pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton said the worst is yet to come.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” the “Godfather of AI” said last September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nDimon’s contrasting remarks are likely to offer some reassurance to workers, signaling that at least some business leaders recognize that replacing employees with AI—without policies to support those displaced—could have serious social consequences.",

    "description": "The mother alleges her daughter was born with a disability as a result of the years of abuse she faced while being trafficked.",
    "fullText": "A mother and daughter sued multiple Motel 6 locations in California for allegedly knowingly facilitating sex trafficking, including one in San Luis Obispo.\n\nThe lawsuit, first filed in the U.S. Eastern District Court of California on Oct. 28 and then amended Jan. 12, alleges that sex trafficking and abuse the mother endured while pregnant caused her daughter to be prematurely born by emergency C-section with quadriplegic cerebral palsy, according to court records.\n\nThe mother and daughter remained anonymous in the complaint, referred to only as Jane Doe 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nIt also alleges G6 Hospitality LLC, the hotel franchiser that owns Motel 6, failed to take action against trafficking occurring at multiple Motel 6 locations and ignored obvious red flags that could have prevented the abuse, which was allegedly apparent to hotel staff.\n\n“For years, sex trafficking ventures have brazenly operated in and out of hotels throughout the United States and especially at Motel 6 and Studio 6 locations,” the complaint said.\n\nThe Motel 6 at 1433 Calle Joaquin — now closed — was one of five locations named in the lawsuit for allegedly having “knowingly participated in atrocities so insurmountable, so indescribable, it defies comprehension — an anguish no woman, no parent and no human should ever be condemned to face,” the complaint said.\n\nThe building will be converted into affordable housing units by People’s Self-Help Housing.\n\nThe other four locations named in the lawsuit were at 1920 Orangeburg Ave., Modesto; 1250 Twin View Blvd., Redding; 250 S. Walnut Road, Turlock; and 150 Northwoods Ave., Manteca.\n\nThe mother and daughter are seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory, statutory and punitive damages including medical costs for negligence and for allegedly violating the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The law was expanded in 2008 to encompass anyone financially benefitting from a venture they knew or could have known was engaging in sex trafficking.\n\nOnly one plaintiff — Pravin G. Patel, the franchise owner of the Manteca location — filed an answer to the complaint on Jan. 12 denying the accusations.\n\nG6 Hospitality LLC did not respond to The Tribune’s request for comment as of Wednesday evening.\n\nThe mother was lured into being trafficked when falsely promised love and financial stability by her captor, the lawsuit said.\n\n“She had no idea he was a trafficker,” the lawsuit said. “After her trafficker gained her trust and confidence, things quickly changed.“\n\nHe began to “control her every move, control her identification, not let her have access to things to get help or away from him, beat her all the time, deprived her of basic needs, threatened her and her family constantly and forced her to engage in commercial sex and follow any and all rules he set for her,” the lawsuit said. He also allegedly drugged her and used weapons to control her.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the mother was forced to perform commercial sex acts — which were often violent in nature — from July 2018 to August 2020, including during her entire pregnancy. She was forced to have sex with as many as eight or more buyers daily, the lawsuit said.\n\nDuring that time, her trafficker used several Motel 6 locations on rotation.\n\n“Motel 6 was her trafficker’s motel of choice because they were known for trafficking, and he knew they would let him get away with it,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Motel 6 profits from regularly and knowingly renting rooms to sex traffickers where they could operate without detection or interruption.\n\nOnline reviews for the Motel 6 locations named in the lawsuit reference potential alleged sex trafficking in the hotel chain, including at the SLO location.\n\nThe mother’s lawsuit alleges that at some Motel 6 locations, managers estimated that up to 90% of their business and profits were directly tied to trafficking, and that when trafficking was reported up the chain, they were encouraged to look the other way.\n\nThe complaint further said that Motel 6 locations “thrive” as a result of sex trafficking.\n\n“To them, it’s a well-thought-out business decision,” the lawsuit said.\n\nFor the mother and daughter, however, it’s “a nightmare they will never wake up from,” the lawsuit said, noting Motel 6 “destroyed their lives.”\n\nG6 Hospitality LLC has faced a slew of sex trafficking lawsuits in recent years, with complaints arguing the chain should be held liable more than its franchisees.\n\nIt was not the first time a SLO County Motel 6 location has been involved in a sex trafficking case, either, with a Pismo Beach location named in a 2016 trial in which four people were accused of trafficking a 15-year-old Manteca girl.\n\nThe mother’s lawsuit alleges that her abuse was known by hotel staff, as well as the fact that she was visibly pregnant during the last few months she was trafficked.\n\nThough the San Luis Obispo hotel was named among the Motel 6 locations, further details on the mother’s experiences at that specific location were not shared in the lawsuit.\n\nAt a Motel 6 in Manteca, the woman would allegedly often run from her trafficker through the hallways screaming, to which motel staff on several occasions asked if she was okay and told her to quiet down, but did not offer to help or stop her continued abuse, according to the lawsuit. The owners of the hotel allegedly lived on the property and knew of the mother’s trafficker, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe owner of another location in Turlock was also allegedly aware the mother was being trafficked and “approached her several times in suggestive ways like he wanted to participate,” the lawsuit said.\n\n“Jane Doe 1 felt helpless and knew she could not tell the employees or ask them for help because they made it clear they knew her trafficker and would not help her,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe hotel staff at a Modesto Motel 6 location, and the front desk woman, in particular, held a “very friendly relationship” with the mother’s trafficker, and often let them sleep in the parking lot where the mother would give money to her trafficker, the lawsuit said.\n\n“She would be constantly watched and abused at this location,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe mother’s trafficker was aggressive with her in front of staff at this location, and she was not allowed to talk to anyone or make eye contact, the lawsuit said. Other victims were also allegedly being trafficked there.\n\nIt was at the Modesto location where the mother had to be taken to the hospital to have an emergency C-section due to forced sexual acts. She was previously denied medical care despite desperate pleas, according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe was “so abused, so often while pregnant that she nearly lost her child, Jane Doe 2, and her life,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe C-section ultimately led to her escape from her captor.\n\n“Our clients have suffered unimaginable trauma that has left them physically and emotionally scarred for life,” Meagan Verschueren, the mother and daughter’s attorney, said in a news release Tuesday. “It is concerning that their suffering went on for so long with multiple hotel locations turning a blind eye, not only to a woman being openly trafficked for sex, but also to the foreseeable harm to her unborn baby.”\n\nA future hearing or court date in the case has yet to be scheduled.",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te on Friday offered talks with Ukraine to crack down on sanctions-busting after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy name-checked ​the island as a source of illicit missile components.\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in ‌2022, semiconductor powerhouse Taiwan has successively updated export controls to stop high-tech goods being used for military purposes, and ‌has joined wide-ranging Western-led sanctions against Moscow.\n\nSpeaking in Davos on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Russia would not be able to produce missiles without \"critical components sourced from China, Europe, the United States, and Taiwan\", according to excerpts published on his website.\n\nResponding on his X account in English, Lai said Taiwan has ⁠long worked with global partners to \"staunchly ‌support Ukraine through humanitarian aid & coordinated sanctions\".\n\n\"We welcome further exchanges of information with President @ZelenskyyUa to further clamp down on illegal 3rd country transshipment & concealed ‍end-use,\" he said, posting a picture of orchids in the colours of Ukraine's flag.\n\nLai said young Taiwanese volunteer soldiers had died fighting against Russia.\n\n\"We remain clear: any assistance to the aggressor or ​violations of int'l embargoes & export control regulations are unacceptable. We pray for peace to be ‌restored to Ukraine soon.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters later, Lai said he hoped Zelenskiy would pass any information to Taiwan about sanctions busting:\n\n\"We are willing to strengthen controls on goods that are routed through third countries while concealing their final destination, to prevent them from entering Russia and to protect Ukraine.\"\n\nUkraine's presidential office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTaiwan's economy ministry said ⁠no chips or machine tools had been exported to ​Russia since April 2024, and the government would prevent ​relevant components from going to Russia.\n\nIn November, Taiwan said it was revising export controls to comply with the Wassenaar Arrangement, an international agreement aimed at preventing ‍weapons proliferation.\n\nWhile senior Taiwan ⁠officials have spoken directly with some Ukrainian city mayors, there has been no publicly acknowledged direct contact between the two governments.\n\nLike most countries, Ukraine has formal diplomatic relations ⁠only with Beijing, not Taipei.\n\nTaiwan has compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to China's military threat against an island ‌it claims as its own. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.",

    "description": "The correspondent recounted asking a question to the president in September related to the First Amendment.",
    "fullText": "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl recalled a specific encounter with President Donald Trump when asked if the president has ever made him “fear” for his safety.\n\nDuring an interview with comedian Hasan Minhaj released Wednesday, Karl pointed to an exchange with Trump in September. While standing with other reporters on the South Lawn, Karl asked the president about comments made by Attorney General Pam Bondi in the wake of the assassination of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What do you make of Pam Bondi saying she’s going to go after hate speech? Is that, I mean, a lot of people, a lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech,” Karl said, according to a video of the interaction.\n\nTrump replied: “She’d probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly. It’s hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart.”\n\n“Would that be appropriate?” Karl could be heard responding in the background, as Trump went on to say, “Maybe they will come after ABC. ABC paid me $16 million recently for a form of hate speech, right? Your company paid me $16 million for a form of hate speech, so maybe they’ll have to go after you.”\n\nIn his comments, the president appeared to reference how ABC News agreed in December 2024 to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over statements about Trump made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nKarl said he asked the president a “very simple question” and called his initial answer a “shocking moment.”\n\n“So the idea that the president of the United States is suggesting that the power of the Department of Justice could be brought to bear against journalists, who the president of the United States doesn’t believe are fair — that’s a very interesting reading of the First Amendment,\" Karl said.\n\nDuring the interview with Minhaj, Karl also discussed how a theme of Trump’s reelection campaign was vowing to “go after” his perceived political enemies. He pointed to his pardons of Jan. 6 rioters on the first day of his second term, as well as the “hollowing out” of the FBI and DOJ.\n\n“There’s nobody like at the White House now telling Donald Trump, ‘Look, sir, we really shouldn’t do this,’” Karl said. “I mean, people advise him, but it’s like he’s got the people around him who are going to carry out the orders.”",

    "description": "“The limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk warned the biggest issue hampering AI advancement in the United States is a problem Chinese competitors don’t have.\n\nIn a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said AI chip production is increasing exponentially, but electrical power is insufficient, hampering the efficiency of AI data centers in training and deploying AI models.\n\n“I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power,” Musk said. “It’s clear that we’re very soon—maybe even later this year—we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on.”\n\nThe U.S. has been grappling with an outdated grid system, the result of decades of underinvestment and an aging infrastructure. As tech companies increasingly rely on grid operators for electrical power, reliability issues and production limitations have threatened the speed of AI implementation, raising investor concerns of an AI bubble and fueling the belief that the U.S. has already lost the battle with Chinese tech.\n\nTwo massive data centers in Nvidia’s Santa Clara, Calif., hometown may sit empty for years waiting for electricity to power them, according to energy experts. Meanwhile, the massive increase in demand, combined with the need for updated infrastructure, have driven up electricity bills for the average American.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration and 13 bipartisan governors mounted pressure on operators of the country’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, to boost power supply, as well as hold an auction for tech firms to make offers on 15-year contracts to build power plants, which would transfer the cost of electricity away from consumers and to data center operators.\n\n“We know that with the demands of AI and the power and the productivity that comes with that, it’s going to transform every job and every company and every industry,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told reporters last week. “But we need to be able to power that in the race that we are in against China.”\n\nDuring his remarks at the gathering in Davos on Wednesday, President Donald Trump encouraged tech companies to build their own nuclear plants amid the AI push, which he claimed the administration would approve in just three weeks—although these historically take years to approve.\n\nJust as many AI investors fear, China is already well ahead of the U.S. when it comes to production capacity, and the country isn’t saddled with the same limitations as the U.S., Musk said at Davos. China is primarily reliant on solar power, seen as a less expensive alternative to nuclear power, with quicker deployment and fewer safety risks.",

    "description": "It's like the last few days never happened.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 closed up 0.55% yesterday on good news about U.S. GDP growth and President Trump retracting his threat to impose more tariffs on Europe if he isn’t given Greenland. After a selloff earlier this week, the S&P is again above 6,900 and within 1% of its all-time high. Gold hit another record yesterday, too.\n\nBut futures on the index were down 0.24% prior to the opening bell in New York and markets in Europe sold off slightly this morning after Asia closed mixed, a sign that traders are booking profits after yesterday’s rally. \n\nOn the macro front, Wall Street analysts are bullish. It’s a marked change from the fraught mood of the last few days.\n\nIn fact, Trump’s tariffs are turning out to be a much smaller economic deal than “earlier worst-case fears,” JPMorgan Chase says. Companies have adjusted their pricing and supply chains, and the result is “the realized tariff rate has been much lower at ~11% (versus expectations of 15%,”), according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and his team. “Only 14% of S&P 500 companies are highly sensitive to tariffs.”\n\nAnd it could get better if the U.S. Supreme Court decides the president lacks the power to unilaterally enact tariffs, the bank says.\n\n“Prediction markets assign >65% odds that the Supreme Court rules against the government, and those odds have consistently been against the government, especially following the November Supreme Court oral arguments,” Lakos-Bujas told clients.\n\nAnalysts were also cheered by a new upward revision for U.S. GDP in the third quarter of last year, at 4.4%.\n\n“The 4.4% real growth rate is much higher than normal and is likely to moderate over the course of the year, but if we can stay above 3% for the entire year it could lead to double-digit returns in the stock market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management said in an email seen by Fortune.\n\nEY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco was singing from the same hymnbook. “Momentum was driven by resilient consumer spending, robust equipment and AI-related investment, a sizeable boost from net international trade, and a rebound in federal government outlays. The U.S. economy is neither overheating nor stalling—it is adjusting,” he said in a note.\n\nAll of that explains the calm we’re seeing in the markets today.\n\n“For some assets, it was almost like the selloff never happened, with the VIX index of volatility (-1.26pts) back at 15.64pts, which is beneath its levels prior to Saturday’s tariff announcements,” according to Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank.",

    "fullText": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — A lawyer for fired University of Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore declared his innocence Thursday and said charges of home invasion and stalking were based on an effort by a staff member to get a financial windfall from the school's “deep pockets.\"\n\nIn a court filing, defense attorney Ellen Michaels responded to allegations that shocked college football in December. It also signals that Moore, who was fired for a relationship with the staffer and arrested hours later, is fighting the charges and wants the case dismissed.\n\n“This Court is not confronted with a close call or a technical defect,” Michaels wrote. “It is confronted with a prosecution that never should have begun.”\n\nMoore was abruptly fired on Dec. 10 for having an inappropriate relationship and for lying during the university's investigation, his dismissal letter states.\n\nAuthorities say Moore later that day entered the woman’s apartment, blamed her for the firing and grabbed butter knives and kitchen scissors while threatening to kill himself.\n\nA prosecutor quoted Moore as telling the woman, “My blood is on your hands.”\n\nMoore, 39, has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony home invasion, stalking and illegal entry.\n\nMichaels said the warrant to arrest Moore was deeply flawed because police wrongly informed a magistrate that Moore had been stalking the woman for months and was dangerous.\n\nMichaels said police relied on misinformation from the woman's personal lawyer, Heidi Sharp, as it investigated what happened. Michaels doesn't dispute that Moore turned up at the woman's apartment, but she claims there's no evidence that she had told him to stay away.\n\n“A magistrate must be given a fair and accurate picture. When the picture is distorted, the warrant cannot stand,” Michaels wrote.\n\nShe accused Sharp of giving information to police to “villainize Mr. Moore and maximize the chances of obtaining a large settlement from the deep pockets of the University of Michigan.”\n\nA message seeking comment from Sharp was not immediately returned.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a judge held a hearing to get an update on the case. Michaels disclosed that she had filed the request to quash the arrest and would argue it at a future date.\n\nWashtenaw County assistant prosecutor Kati Rezmierski said she had just received the filing. The next hearing was set for Feb. 17.\n\nMoore arrived at the courthouse with his wife, Kelli and waited in an adjacent courtroom for his case to be called. He declined to comment but stood nearby when Michaels briefly spoke to reporters and said he's innocent.\n\nMoore coached the Wolverines for two seasons as the successor to Jim Harbaugh, who won a national championship before quitting to become coach of the NFL’s Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nKyle Whittingham, who coached Utah for two decades, is the new Michigan coach.",

    "description": "He did not hold back against the media.",
    "fullText": "Former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino harshly tore into the media during his first televised interview since departing President Donald Trump’s administration, describing outlets as having “a full diaper all the time.”\n\nBongino, a former Secret Service agent, officially returned to private life earlier this month after serving in his role in the FBI for less than a year. Since his departure, he announced he will return to hosting his self-titled podcast show in early February while becoming increasingly candid on social media.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News late Thursday, Bongino accused the media of having a double standard when it comes to reporting on public safety.\n\nEarlier in the day, Axios reported — citing data from the Council on Criminal Justice — that the U.S. murder rate has reached its lowest level since 1900. However, the outlet noted that violent crime was already falling to a two-decade law during former President Joe Biden’s final year in office, indicating it raises questions about whether Trump’s policies have had an impact on the decline.\n\n“Well, there’s a thousand excuses as to why President Trump and his administration didn’t do it,” Bongino told host Sean Hannity. “Meanwhile, I lived it. I know what we did and didn’t do for these dumba----.”\n\nHe then pointed to a story from The New York Times, which released interviews with 45 current and former employees who accused the FBI under its director, Kash Patel, of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?”\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge,“ he continued. ”Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country.\"\n\nBongino went on to say that the media is a “big full diaper,” adding he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity declared that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” noting that he was more restrained while working for the FBI.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”",

    "fullText": "Su Hobson, 53, is a longevity coach for midlife women. She lives in Silverdale, Lancashire, with her husband Christian and their two sons.\n\nLike many women, I spent far too much of my adult life obsessing about my weight and bouncing between dieting extremes. After giving birth to my second son when I was 41, I barely had the time or energy for exercise and fuelled my days with sugar to counteract the sleepless nights. Whilst I was never significantly overweight, I was larger than I should have been for my 5ft 4in frame, and felt heavy and uncomfortable in my body. I was convinced that my healthiest years were behind me.\n\nChatting to my husband, Christian, one day about how unhappy I felt physically, I realised that I was the only one with the power to change things. I was stuck in a rut, but finally realised I needed to reframe my thinking. That was the moment I decided I was going to overhaul my life entirely. I gave myself nine years to make it work, with the goal of turning 50 looking and feeling better than ever before.\n\nNow, aged 53, I have finally worked out how to stay fit, strong and healthy whilst eating more and training less. Here’s how I did it.\n\nIn my late 20s I lived alone and ate very poorly. My demanding corporate job as a project manager for a London consultancy firm meant convenience was key and I finished most evenings with a ready meal, a sweet treat and a glass of wine. Despite this I was still very skinny as I spent much of my free time running on the treadmill at my local gym. Exercise, back then, was purely about losing weight and burning calories.\n\nWithout me realising, the weight slowly crept on. I didn’t notice until I tried to buy an outfit for my 30th birthday and could no longer fit into my usual size 8. Whilst I was never particularly overweight, I remember absolutely hating how I looked in all of the photographs of that night. I felt heavy and could only get into clothes that were size 10 or 12.\n\nMy approach to everything in life was always “all or nothing” so I decided to start the Atkins diet which was popular back in the early 2000s. I demonised carbohydrates and would binge on highly-processed and artificially sweetened bars, convinced they were the healthier alternative to sugar. As my weight dropped, I decided to stop exercising as I saw it purely as a means to burn calories and felt it was no longer necessary.\n\nI stayed on the Atkins diet for two years, which in hindsight seems insane, but at the time I thought I looked amazing. I still vividly remember looking at myself in the mirror one morning and loving the fact I could see my ribs and bones sticking out. Looking back now though, I know I lacked energy and had zero motivation because my eating was disordered and I neglected my fitness.\n\nCommon sense finally prevailed and I started to overhaul my restrictive diet around the time I met Christian. We loved treating ourselves to a date night at a fancy restaurant which probably helped. After we got engaged, I got myself a personal trainer as I wanted to look great on our wedding day in February 2009. It paid off – by my mid-30s I was in great shape.\n\nThe next year, I gave birth to our first child, then two years later, we moved across the world to Singapore. While I loved being a new mum and Christian was incredibly supportive and caring, I struggled with the pressures of relocating whilst looking after our toddler and turned to my old friends – sugar and alcohol – to cope.\n\nMy cravings often dictated my mood, and I felt my best when eating a bar of chocolate or drinking a glass of wine. I was a sugar monster.\n\nAfter I gave birth to our second child in May 2013, I struggled with post-natal depression – my hormones and mood were all over the place, I barely slept and didn’t have the time or energy to exercise or cook from scratch. Once again, I found myself feeling heavy and uncomfortable in my body.\n\nI looked back on my wedding day four years previous and worried that it had been my “peak”. Perhaps it was all meant to be downhill from there? I felt hopeless and exhausted, but a small part of me refused to succumb to a life of discomfort and insecurity. So came my turning point, and my decision to dedicate the next nine years of my life to becoming fitter and healthier than ever before.\n\nAlthough I had been stuck in a rut for a while, I was incredibly determined and once I put my mind to something, I stick to it. When we left the UK, I left my corporate job behind and needed to find a new career and decided to qualify as a personal trainer. This would allow me to help others while ensuring I held myself accountable for my own fitness goals. While doing this, I discovered Joe Wicks’ YouTube channel and his HIIT workouts. Immediately, I was hooked and started following his online sessions every day.\n\nWe moved to Dubai in 2015 and I continued my training. My next priority was sorting out my sugary diet. Rather than a radical overhaul, I began making small and sustainable changes – eating less, tracking my calories, and cutting down on sugar. By doing this and HIIT training almost every day, my body started to change rather quickly. I qualified as a PT, began taking on clients, and started my Instagram page to share our fitness journeys.\n\nThen, in 2017, we moved to Saudi Arabia and that’s where I discovered strength training. I got a job as head trainer at an F45 fitness studio and began teaching HIIT classes. While I still loved it, I was itching to try something new. Previously, I had read about the benefits of weightlifting for women in midlife and decided to give it a go.\n\nWalking into the weights section of the gym was intimidating at first (although I never let it show!). Despite being a PT, I felt slightly nervous being a middle-aged woman in uncharted territory. Initially, I stuck to the machines and dumbbells but, once I had gained some confidence, began experimenting with barbell exercises.\n\nRather than doing HIIT workouts every day, I dropped down to two sessions and began lifting weights three times a week. While my workout regime was far less intense, it had the biggest impact on my fitness and physique. I soon realised that less is more.\n\nI prioritised protein and was soon eating more of it than I ever had. Initially, I relied on protein bars and other processed sources however, over time, I realised they weren’t doing my gut health any favours. So, I began eating a whole foods diet with fresh protein sources like chicken and fish. I still have a major sweet tooth but rather than relying on ice cream and cake, I began experimenting with healthier alternatives like dark chocolate and yogurt bowls.\n\nCreatine (a supplement which improves muscle strength) became a bit of a buzzword around the gym, so I read up on it and its potential benefits for midlife women. I decided to start taking it and it had a major impact on my physique. The results weren’t overnight – I worked hard for them – but two and a half years later I had visible muscles and abs of which I was incredibly proud.\n\nChristian has supported me the entire way and is very proud of my transformation. He is always telling people about my job and my lifestyle overhaul. In 2021, I moved back to the UK with the boys to settle them into school, but Christian had to stay in Saudi Arabia for two more years which was stressful and hard at times.\n\nHowever, by my 50th birthday I had achieved my goal and was in the best shape and health of my life. It was an incredible feeling. I felt strong with defined muscles and had even managed to kick my sugar addiction and fix my diet by implementing small and sustainable habits, rather than a dramatic overhaul.\n\nThere was still one more step left to take: kicking my reliance on alcohol. My relationship with drinking had been unhealthy since I was a teenager. I drank for bad reasons – initially for confidence and later as a coping strategy – and always overdid it, ending most nights out with memory loss and embarrassing myself.\n\nAs my children got older, they started commenting on my alcohol use and regularly told me that they didn’t like me drinking. It was really upsetting, but also the motivation I needed to finally give up completely, that “all or nothing” approach kicking in once again to get me through.\n\nI had wanted to give up drinking a few times in the past, but could never do it. However, when I finally decided to quit on my 50th birthday, it was like flicking a switch. I never went back – and have been sober for over three years.\n\nUntil that point, my focus had always been on aesthetics. Once I reached my goal and had completely embedded my health habits, I decided to shift my focus to slowing down and ageing healthily. Whilst I like having a toned physique, I realised that future-proofing my body and health was far more important.\n\nThese days, my workouts tend to be quite short. Rather than endless hours of cardio, I strength train in my home gym with dumbbells for about half an hour, four times a week.\n\nMost of my workouts use compound movements to simultaneously work multiple muscle groups, purely because they are time-efficient and better at raising the heart rate. From a longevity perspective, these exercises are incredibly effective as they help to build functional strength for daily life.\n\nMy favourite exercises include a dumbbell snatch and press (which works the legs, back, core and arms), a kettlebell swing, and hip thrusts.\n\nWhile I used to meticulously track my calories, I now eat intuitively and focus on both protein and fibre in my diet (ensuring at least 25g per day of the latter). I would estimate that I eat more than 2,000 calories most days – mainly whole foods, although I still enjoy sweet treats. Life’s too short.\n\nAt 41, I didn’t have much muscle; now I carry around 25kg of skeletal muscle mass, which is a significant amount for my size and age. Meanwhile, my body fat has dropped from 28 per cent to around 19 per cent. And, more importantly, my bone density has increased rather than declined, whilst my biological age is 15 years younger than my actual age.\n\nLike many women, I grew up believing that I needed to be skinny to feel beautiful. I restricted my food intake and spent hours running to “burn fat”, believing that a smaller body would make me happier. Now, I know that rather than shrinking, growing and getting strong is far more crucial. Through my work and sharing my story, I hope I can help other midlife women feel the same.\n\nNow, aged 53, I have energy, resilience and strength – both physically and mentally – that I never had in my 40s.\n\nDon’t stop doing what you enjoy. If an afternoon run or occasional sweet treat makes you happy, please don’t stop doing it for the sake of your fitness transformation. You’re more likely to stick to your journey if you enjoy it.\n\nWeightlifting is so important for healthy ageing and longevity. If you can fit in two to three sessions a week – even if you’re lifting weights in your front room – it will make such a difference.\n\nDon’t over-exercise. Prioritising rest and recovery is crucial for your long-term health. In midlife, there’s little benefit to exerting yourself six to seven days each week. Aim for two to four workouts a week and pay attention to how well you’re sleeping and recovering in between.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Rhode Island and other parts of Southern New England could see up to 18 inches of snow from a storm starting Sunday and continuing into Monday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nA winter storm watch and a cold weather advisory have been issued, as dangerously cold weather will move into Southern New England ahead of the storm on Friday afternoon, Jan. 23.\n\n\"At the moment the most likely snowfall totals are in the 8-14 inch range,\" the weather service said in its forecast discussion early Friday morning.\n\nThe range could be higher, 12 to 18 inches, for most of Southern New England, the weather service indicated in a graphic posted to social media also early on Friday morning. The weather service predicted those snowfall totals early as part of its \"initial most likely snow accumulation forecast.\"\n\nSetting records: How often does RI get a foot of snow? How this weekend's storm stacks up\n\nIn a social media post, the agency characterized its confidence in the snowfall total forecast as \"medium\" and said, \"Keep in mind, this will be refined/changed as things come into better focus over the next 24-48 hours, so check back!\"\n\nThe 12- to 18-inch snowfall forecast indicated on the graphic is consistent throughout Southern New England, except for Block Island, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, which could get lower totals, 8 to 12 inches, due to the potential for mixed precipitation, the weather service said.\n\nThe snow is most likely to start Sunday morning into early Sunday afternoon, with the heaviest snowfall Sunday evening into early Monday morning, the weather service said. Light to moderate snow will linger during the day Monday, the weather service said.\n\n\"Travel will be difficult, especially Sunday night into Monday morning when accumulation rates will be highest,\" the weather service said.\n\nThe storm will affect millions of Americans as it moves across the central part of the country through the Southeast then into New England, according to forecasters.\n\n\"The system moving out of the plains will direct a plume of deep moisture and warm air into/over top of a dome of subfreezing air associated with a sprawling high pressure over the northeast which will lead to a prolonged period of snowfall, some of it heavy,\" the weather service says in its forecast discussion.\n\nComputer models are showing some \"varying degree of spread\" in the track of the storm, \"which is one factor that would lead us to be cautious in declaring exact snowfall amounts as the track is a factor,\" the weather service said.\n\nIn trying to determine the impact of winter storms, forecasters consider how close it will pass to a benchmark about 80 miles southeast of Nantucket, at 40 degrees north latitude and 70 degrees west longitude.\n\n\"Another related factor\" is a layer of warmer air that could \"lead to a period of mixed precipitation on the south coast overnight, potentially up into the south shore of eastern MA and northern RI,\" the weather service said.\n\n\"Whatever snow does fall isn't going anywhere fast as a cold airmass remains entrenched over the northeast next week (highs in the teens and 20s),\" the forecast discussion said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: RI weather forecast: Snow storm Sunday and Monday could dump 18 inches",

    "fullText": "A Portland and Western Railroad train derailed early Jan. 21 in Toledo near the Oregon Coast, damaging a trestle over Olalla Slough and briefly blocking nearby roadways.\n\nThe train was travelling south towards Albany when the derailment occurred at approximately 5 a.m. Three locomotives went off the tracks as the train approached the bridge, Oregon Department of Transportation spokesperson Chris Crabb said.\n\nOfficials said no one was injured and the train was not carrying hazardous materials. The cause of the derailment is currently unknown.\n\nPortland and Western Railroad is owned by Genesee and Wyoming Inc. and runs local freight services in the Willamette Valley and in Washington and Columbia counties.\n\nThe damaged trestle is located near the end of a branch line that connects to Toledo.\n\n\"The bridge sustained damage and will undergo inspection and repairs once an investigation into the incident is completed and the scene is cleared,\" said Tom Ciuba, spokesperson for Portland & Western Railroad.\n\nIn total, six pieces of equipment derailed, including three locomotives, a slug unit used to boost traction, and two loaded boxcars that had not yet reached the bridge.\n\nThere are currently three railcars and three locomotives still at the scene.\n\n\"We are working with contractors on assessments and plans to rerail them, which will likely involve the use of cranes,\" said Ciuba.\n\nThe National Response Center and Oregon Emergency Response were notified after the derailment, and the Republic service was dispatched to control a diesel leak from the PNWR 3002 locomotive, Crabb said. Some road crossings were blocked after the derailment as crews worked to pull the unimpacted portion of the train out of the way.\n\n\"They are still stabilizing the locomotives and getting contractor bids to do the heavy lifting,\" Crabb said. \"There is no ETA for the rail line being opened. The best guess is 5-10 days before it’s open for rail traffic.\"\n\nWhile closures could continue near the bridge, a section of southeast East Slope Road has now reopened.\n\nGinnie Sandoval is the Oregon Connect reporter for the Statesman Journal.

Authorities have described the case as a coordinated attack and the investigation involved hundreds of hours of work across multiple states.\n\nRaylen Ferguson, 38, of Lexington, Kentucky, is charged with attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, aggravated battery and multiple counts of battery with a deadly weapon and intimidation. Prosecutors also filed attempted obstruction of justice charges, along with gang and firearm enhancements.\n\nThomas Moss, 43, of Lafayette, and Blake Smith, 32, also of Lafayette, face similar charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Both men are additionally charged as habitual offenders. Smith is also charged with assisting a criminal by providing a deadly weapon.\n\nTwo other defendants face charges related to allegedly helping obstruct the investigation. Amanda Milsap, 45, of Lafayette, is charged with bribery and obstruction of justice. Zenada Greer, 61, of Lexington, Kentucky, is charged with assisting a criminal and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe shooting occurred Sunday night when police say Steven Meyer, a judge for Tippecanoe County Superior Court 2, and his wife, Kimberly Meyer, were shot outside their home. Steven Meyer was wounded in the arm and Kimberly Meyer was shot in the hip.

    "fullText": "Kristalina Georgieva says research suggests 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected, with many entry-level roles wiped out\n\nArtificial intelligence will be a “tsunami hitting the labour market”, with young people worst affected, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned the World Economic Forum on Friday.\n\nKristalina Georgieva told delegates in Davos that the IMF’s own research suggested there would be a big transformation of demand for skills, as the technology becomes increasingly widespread.\n\n“We expect over the next years, in advanced economies, 60% of jobs to be affected by AI, either enhanced or eliminated or transformed – 40% globally,” she said. “This is like a tsunami hitting the labour market.”\n\nShe suggested that in advanced economies, one in 10 jobs had already been “enhanced” by AI, tending to boost these workers’ pay, with knock-on benefits for the local economy.\n\nMeanwhile people whose jobs were not directly changed by artificial intelligence risked being squeezed, she said, with their pay potentially falling without a productivity boost from AI.\n\n“So the middle class, inevitably, is going to be affected,” Georgieva predicted.\n\nShe said her greatest fear was that AI was insufficiently regulated. “This is moving so fast, and yet we don’t know how to make it safe. We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.\n\nMuch of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked by Donald Trump’s on-off tariff threats over the future of Greenland.\n\nBut many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”\n\n“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.\n\n“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.\n\nGeorgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.\n\n“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.\n\nLagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.\n\nEarlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.\n\nBut Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”",

    "fullText": "US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over private share sale that values business at $800bn\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly lining up four Wall Street banks to help the company list on the stock market as investors prepare for an expected rush of US tech listings.\n\nSpaceX is considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in an initial public offering, according to the Financial Times and Reuters.\n\nThe US aerospace tech company reportedly held talks last year over a private share sale that values the business at $800bn (£591bn), months after it was valued at $400bn. Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.\n\nLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.\n\nReports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. The potential IPOs have been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms and datacentres into orbit.\n\nReferring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AI IPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?\n\n“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”\n\nGoldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and SpaceX were approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Politicians call for more infrastructure funding amid anger that county is seen as ‘holiday playground’\n\nAccessed by a steep, winding lane, the tiny settlement of Cucurrian in the far-west of Cornwall feels remote at the best of times. But over the last two weeks, the people who live here have felt even more isolated after they were left without a way of communicating with the outside world as a result of Storm Goretti.\n\n“I think people feel let down, angry, failed,” said Mark Pugh, an audiobook producer, who has spent more hours than he would care to tot up carefully picking his way out of Cucurrian and sitting in his car in a layby to find a mobile signal good enough to work from. “This storm has shown that Cornwall isn’t resilient enough. A lot is promised, but not enough is delivered.”\n\nGoretti brought down thousands of power, phone and broadband lines and caused countless trees to fall, including one that crushed the caravan of 50-year-old James Southey and killed him.\n\nFor days, many hundreds of people were left without power, water or both, but while those services have been restored, communication links in some places remain down a fortnight on. In a world where reliable online connections are needed for everything from health consultations to banking, it makes life very difficult.\n\n“It’s like we’re forgotten,” said Elaine Claxton, 70, an actor, as she pointed to the wires still broken and dangling next to a giant fallen tree on the lane leading to her home in Cucurrian. She has no broadband, no landline and the mobile signal is unreliable at best. Staying in touch with frail family members a few miles away has been fraught.\n\nHer sister, Shelley Claxton, 63, an animal trainer, said places such as Cucurrian were resilient. “When you’re as remote as we are, you have to be, but I think this storm shows us we need to do something different. Nature is whipping up more and more storms and we need to find ways of adapting to that.”\n\nOn the Lizard peninsula, the southernmost point of the British mainland, Sam Kirby, 53, described how the communication breakdown led to difficulties in working as a digital marketing consultant and in her volunteer role as a coastguard rescue officer.\n\nHer old-style copper landline meant the coastguard station officer could – just about – contact her by phone, but without broadband, working was challenging.\n\n“I had to go full digital nomad, which included time working in a supermarket car park with the car heater on, in the library, and basically perching anywhere I could to find wifi,” she said.\n\n“We’re constantly being told by those pushing Cornwall as a place to work that we’ve got to trade nationally or internationally, that we have the best broadband in the country, that we’re a booming digital economy. It’s hard to boom digitally when you can’t even get a text message out.”\n\nKirby and the people of Cucurrian are angry that Openreach, which builds and maintains the UK’s largest broadband network, has not restored services more quickly.\n\nThere is concern that the continuing switch from copper phone lines to full-fibre broadband makes them more vulnerable. “If this happens again next year, we won’t even have the copper landline so won’t have any link out at all,” said Kirby.\n\nIt is not just remote communities that have been hit. Karen Bennett, 72, lives close to Penzance town centre but a pine tree brought down a pole there, cutting off her broadband.\n\nA new pole has been put up but the broadband hasn’t returned, making her work as chair of the twinning association forging links between Penzance and the French town of Concarneau difficult. “We’ve had to find ways of working around it,” she said. “It’s frustrating. We still don’t know when the broadband will be back.”\n\nThese are interesting political and cultural times in Cornwall. The UK government has indicated that it will explore a bespoke devolution deal for Cornwall, possibly giving it more control over transport, housing and economic development.\n\nThis week the Cornish language – Kernewek – was officially recognised under part three of the European charter for regional or minority languages, which gives it greater protection and status.\n\nBut the loss of power, water and the continuing communications issues have made many Cornish people question whether the rest of the UK cares enough about the far-west of Britain, when it is not holidaying or visiting second homes there.\n\nLoveday Jenkin, a leading member of the political party Mebyon Kernow, which campaigns for greater self-government for Cornwall, said Goretti had exposed weaknesses in its infrastructure.\n\n“It shows Cornwall should have more devolved resilience money,” Jenkin said. “People want to treat Cornwall as a holiday playground. They need to recognise that there are people on the ground who have to manage it but don’t have the money.”\n\nJenkin spoke as yet another storm, named Ingrid by the Portuguese national weather service, brought in strong winds and heavy rain on Friday. “I think UK government needs to recognise Cornwall as the canary in the coalmine in relation to climate change,” Jenkin said. “There will be more storms coming.”\n\nOpenreach said it could not put a figure on how many people in Cornwall were still without broadband and rejected the idea that the switch to fibre made the county more vulnerable, arguing the outages were largely down to trees falling on overhead wires or taking down poles, which affected the copper and fibre network.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Storm Goretti has caused the worst impact to our network in Cornwall in recent memory and as soon as it was safe to do so, we’ve had teams of engineers working round the clock to repair the extensive damage.\n\n“We have managed to reconnect thousands of homes and businesses, but there is more to do and we know how frustrating that is. Unfortunately, the reality is that this type of repair work – closing roads, replacing poles and overhead cables – is complex and time-consuming.”\n\nThe recovery will take a long time. Alasdair Moore, the head of estate and gardens on Tresco, one of the Isles of Scilly, which lies 30 miles (48km) off the mainland and was battered by 99mph gusts during Goretti, said the effect was devastating.\n\nTrees fell, houses were damaged and the water supply interrupted. “The scale of the clear-up is huge,” said Moore. “It will be ongoing for a few years but the way the community and the team has responded has been magnificent.”\n\nMoore said remote communities such as those huddled on Scilly and west Cornwall always got on with it and came good. “Dealing with gales is very much part of this place’s history,” he said.",

    "title": "From the workplace to geopolitics to robots: Our team's Davos takeaways",
    "description": "That's a wrap on Davos 2026. Here are the biggest takeaways from our team on the ground.",
    "fullText": "And that's a wrap. Davos 2026 is in the books.\n\nI asked my colleagues who were on the ground with me to share their takes. It's a good mix of backgrounds (tech, finance, workplace) and Davos experience (from first timers to crafty vets).\n\nIf you missed any of it, we covered the week as it unfolded. You can catch up with our day-by-day liveblogs here: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.\n\nAki Ito: This was my first Davos, but from what I heard, previous years were marked by much more optimism about the immediate productivity gains AI would bring. This year the vibe was more sober.\n\nMost of my conversations were about why the ROI from AI has been so mediocre so far, and how to fix that. A lot of the fixes that I heard about involved the kind of massive overhauls that will almost certainly take large companies years and years to pull off.\n\nUnderlying that reality was more than a hint of frustration from the Davos class. But the harder-than-expected transition is good news for the white-collar employees I talk to everyday.\n\nWhen disruption comes at lightning speed, people don't have time to prepare for it. When it happens over a more manageable timeline, we have time to learn new skills, to advocate for new protections, to try to shape the future we actually want.\n\nThat doesn't mean massive change isn't coming eventually though. Lots for me to think about. For now I can't wait to catch up on sleep!\n\nBen Bergman: Davos has always wanted to be the center of the world. This year, it felt like it actually was.\n\nPresident Trump brought traffic snarls, longer security lines, and most of all, he dominated conversations here.\n\nHe also brought heft, making Davos feel much more important than it has than at any time in recent memory. This year's conference played host not just to the pie-in-the-sky discussions that usually dominate, but also high-stakes negotiations about the future of NATO, Greenland, and Gaza.\n\nEven Elon Musk, who had previously mocked Davos, could not stay away.\n\nJust as it appeared the summit had reached its apex on Wednesday, as some attendees began to work their way down the mountain, we learned that Musk's Gulfstream G650 was on its way to Zurich for a surprise interview with WEF interim chair Larry Fink.\n\nFink, whose day job is as chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, told Semafor he personally asked Trump to come, which in turn also attracted many of the biggest names in business.\n\nFink, or whoever is the chair of WEF next year, has a tough act to follow.\n\nDan DeFrancesco: Are we entering a new era in geopolitics, or is this just another example of President Donald Trump's aggressive dealmaking tactics? That's the question I've been thinking about this entire week.\n\nSome attendees I spoke to this week seemed optimistic. Sure, the threat of force against a longtime ally wasn't great. But a deal was ultimately brokered. And the US has too many resources to ignore.\n\nOthers feel a real trust has been broken, and there will be no easy path back toward complete reconciliation.\n\nAnd the split on the debate among Europeans and Americans might surprise you. Two bankers I separately spoke to within the same firm were divided on the issue, with the American being the one who was feeling pessimistic.\n\nKim Last: Jumping off of Aki's thoughts, I was most struck by the lack of answers many of the executives I spoke to had when it came to employing the next generation of workers. When pressed, of course there was an acknowledgment that AI is already reshaping the nature and future of entry-level white collar work. (Hello, grim anecdotes from recent college grads.)\n\nDavos has always been a platform for new ideas, yet the sense I have is that the leaders gathered here haven't deeply thought about the ways education or job preparation need to evolve to meet this moment for young workers —and their role in shaping and supporting that work. I've wondered several times this week what the future of middle managers will look like 10 years from now, and what that pipeline of workers might look like.\n\nIn the previous years, it felt like education leaders had more of a front row seat to these conversations, but we know institutions are deep in rehauling how AI is rolled out in curricula. We might just have to see what happens next year.\n\nAnd, on a lighter note, my blowout hack lasted for the duration of the week. It's a Davos trick that never fails me.\n\nJamie Heller: Maybe I'm late to the party, but I came away with a new appreciation for the excitement around \"physical AI.\" The way I am coming to understand it, the large language models behind the chatbots we are all using are based on information the models scarf up from the digital world — essentially the internet — and then create digital outputs, like text, images, and video.\n\nPhysical AI is about AI in the physical world — robots and machines. With AI, robots don't just do what they're told but are intelligent and can learn and adapt. I participated in three panels related to this, and while everyone acknowledges the standard level of Davos/tech hype, there was clear real excitement, including from savvy scientific types.\n\nThen, in the midst of all the Davos chatter, Business Insider's Grace Kay reported exclusive details on OpenAI's push into humanoid robotics — robots modeled after humans.\n\nIs it all the stuff of science fiction? As Elon Musk said this week at Davos, he wants to turn science fiction into \"science fact\" — and clearly many others do, too. How it all goes? We'll keep reporting for you.",

    "fullText": "Gavin Newsom's return to Davos was always going to be loud. It just wasn't clear how chaotic it would get.\n\nOver the course of a few days in the Swiss Alps, the California governor criticized President Donald Trump, was denied entry to the USA House, waved red kneepads at corporate leaders, and traded insults with Trump's Treasury secretary.\n\nNewsom had framed his attendance at the World Economic Forum as a direct challenge to Trump on the global stage.\n\nLast week, his office said he planned to rebut the president's economic agenda, defend \"democratic capitalism,\" and position California as a counterweight to what he called Trump's \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nTrump spoke first, addressing business and political leaders on Wednesday morning. Newsom, watching from the room, criticized the speech shortly afterward.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, including Business Insider's Ben Bergman, Newsom said the audience reaction was muted because Trump spoke down to people, adding that \"had there not been cellphones, I think a few people would have passed out from boredom.\"\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, later dismissed Newsom as a \"third-rate governor\" in comments to Business Insider, saying that it was unclear why he was \"frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.\"\n\nTensions escalated hours later on Wednesday when Newsom was denied entry to the USA House, the official US pavilion at Davos, where he was scheduled to talk in a fireside chat hosted by Fortune.\n\nNewsom's office said the invitation was rescinded at the last minute due to pressure from the White House and State Department.\n\nNewsom blasted the move on X, calling it \"weak and pathetic\" to block a fireside chat. His office said that multiple Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, had spoken at the pavilion earlier that day.\n\nBessent, for his part, didn't hold back. He publicly called Newsom \"economically illiterate,\" \"smug,\" and \"too self-absorbed,\" escalating what had already become a personal feud playing out in front of the global business elite.\n\nNewsom got his biggest moment on Thursday during another scheduled Davos appearance.\n\nIn an onstage interview with Semafor's Ben Smith, he said that the US was no longer governed by the rule of law but by what he called \"the rule of Don,\" accusing Congress, universities, law firms, and corporate leaders of bending the knee to the president.\n\nTo make the point, Newsom brought in bright red kneepads — a prop meant to symbolize corporate capitulation — drawing applause from the audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, acknowledged Newsom in his own Davos remarks on Wednesday. \"We're going to help the people in California,\" Trump said. \"We want to have no crime. I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin is a good guy.\"\n\nThe governor declined a later invitation to return to the USA House for a private nightcap reception.\n\nPolitical experts told Business Insider that Newsom's return to Davos signals ambitions beyond California.\n\nHis decision to confront Trump in front of global business and political leaders has renewed speculation that he is laying the groundwork for a potential 2028 presidential bid.",

    "fullText": "Engineers: Corporate America wants you.\n\nThe Big Four firm PwC, a legacy institution for consultants and accountants, has made hiring engineers a priority.\n\nThe firm launched a new engineering track on Wednesday, formalizing an \"engineering-first\" approach that PwC says it has been quietly building for years.\n\nThe move is designed to attract and retain technical talent while helping the firm deliver more AI-native, cloud-based solutions for clients.\n\n\"Engineers are central to how we help clients grow and transform, and they're vital to the future of our firm,\" said Yolanda Seals-Coffield, PwC US's chief people and inclusion officer, in a press release.\n\nThis investment in engineers is about building teams with capabilities in advanced software development, deep industry insight, and emerging technologies that will help solve complex business challenges for clients, said Seals-Coffield.\n\nPwC will further expand investment in AI-focused learning experiences to help engineers deepen their expertise, and is launching an initiative for junior recruits called \"Engineer Your Career,\" aimed at recruiting rising college juniors interested in engineering roles.\n\nIn November, Mohamed Kanede, global chairman of PwC, told the BBC the firm is looking for hundreds and hundreds of engineers, but is having trouble finding them.\n\nPwC's push to elevate engineering to a distinct, firmwide discipline is another sign of how consulting is repositioning itself as a technology-first service.\n\nClients increasingly need support for multi-year digital transformations as they adapt to the AI-enhanced world, and proposing an army of generalist consultants isn't the solution they want.\n\nAs the work changes, technical skills are becoming a top priority across the industry.\n\nAccenture, already one of consulting's most technically sophisticated players, has added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global headcount.\n\nEY, another Big Four firm, has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nThis week, Deloitte US even did away with the old job titles.\n\nThe firm announced internally that it was renaming all its professionals to better reflect their work. The current talent structure was designed for \"a more homogenous workforce of 'traditional' consulting profiles,\" according to an internal presentation seen by Business Insider.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Military competition between the US and rivals Russia and China in the Arctic is exposing weaknesses in the US arsenal.",
    "fullText": "For war across the freezing Arctic battlefields, the US faces a problem: it doesn't have the right weapons or tools to reliably detect threats in the region and respond to them quickly.\n\nThe Arctic is an unforgiving place for a war. It's a location where distances are vast, subzero temperatures can cripple equipment, and forces must operate with limited support infrastructure, but as competition with US rivals and adversaries becomes fiercer, there is a growing realization that a future fight could unfold across an Arctic battlespace. Among experts and officials, there's also increasing concern about US readiness.\n\nIf US forces in the region can't spot threats early, position assets effectively, and sustain troops in harsh conditions, the region could become a corridor for undetected attacks.\n\nGaps in Arctic defenses have been one element of President Donald Trump's erratic rhetoric on US interests in the acquisition of Greenland. He has said it is necessary for the substantial US missile defense project known as Golden Dome.\n\n\"If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice,\" Trump said on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Think of it: those missiles would be flying right over the center.\"\n\nThe president isn't the first to call attention to the strategic and national security implications surrounding the Arctic. Warnings have come from across administrations.\n\nLeaders in Washington have expressed similar concerns about the importance of the Arctic region for homeland defense in recent years. In its 2024 Arctic strategy doctrine, the US Department of Defense emphasized the need for better, more modernized all-domain awareness, surveillance and sensors, naval capabilities, and missile warning technologies. Existing systems, the department said, weren't sufficient for the growing threats in the region.\n\nSpecifically, the US, along with some of its NATO allies, has underinvested in capabilities needed to detect, track, and respond to activity across vast Arctic distances.\n\nSome necessary capabilities include aerial and underwater surveillance, as well as defense and naval warfare capabilities like anti-submarine frigates, heavy icebreakers, polar-capable multi-mission surface vessels, and dual-use sealift capacity, Liselotte Odgaard, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote in a new report. Infrastructure such as undersea sensor networks, command and control systems, ports, runways, and roads is also lacking.\n\n\"As a result, the US and its allies have insufficient monitoring, response, and sustainment options,\" she explained. \"These shortfalls allow adversaries to transit waters and territories undetected, sustain forces in combat theaters for prolonged periods, and successfully challenge allied forces in combat-like situations.\"\n\nUS presence, whether through domain awareness or more constant exercises in the region, has also been lacking, leaving the Arctic as the \"shortest and least defended threat sector,\" former deputy commander of US Northern Command, Army Gen. Thomas Carden, said in 2024.\n\nWith recognition of the challenges has come new efforts. Recent moves, like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Coast Guard’s fiscal year 2026 budget, have included millions of dollars for new icebreakers, Coast Guard cutters, and needed Arctic infrastructure upgrades. The Coast Guard’s newly renamed Arctic District has taken on a more prominent monitoring role, and last year, the service received its first polar icebreaker in over 25 years.\n\nAdditionally, the US is working to field new air defense systems and interceptors to replace or supplement the ones in Alaska. And the Space Force's 2026 budget includes billions for Golden Dome, specifically space-based sensors and interceptors, and modernization efforts at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nBut key areas remain underdeveloped.\n\nAs Odgaard wrote in her new report, parts of the airspace over eastern Greenland and the North Pole are not consistently surveilled, and the submarine detection and tracking capabilities along Greenland's eastern coast fall short of what is needed.\n\nThose gaps are concerning as Russia focuses on expanding submarine operations in the Arctic.\n\nUncrewed systems, both naval and aerial drones, could, in theory, extend surveillance coverage across vast areas that are expensive and difficult to patrol without increasing the demand on traditional crewed aircraft and assets.\n\nThe harsh Arctic environment could challenge such efforts. With drones, it could stress their batteries, range, connections, and performance. Recent exercises have shown troops that temperatures below freezing, low visibility, snowy or icy conditions, and strong winds can degrade aerial drones and other equipment.\n\nThe US' renewed investments in preparation for Arctic warfare come as Russia and China are deepening cooperation and more actively pursuing interests in the region. Russia has been looking to expand where its submarines can operate as China positions itself strategically as a \"near Arctic\" nation, joining Russia on joint patrols, including ones near Alaska. China is also investing in naval capabilities, ships, and drones for the region.",

    "fullText": "While the US military has pursued ambitious technological advances, manpower remains one of its core pillars.\n\nFrom high-ranking generals to soldiers on the field, human troops remain a key way to assess the reach and power of the world's militaries.\n\nUsing data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 2025 Military Balance report, Business Insider ranked countries by the size of their active armed forces and listed their defense budgets, based on 2024 figures.\n\nActive-duty force size is a tally of a country's uniformed troops: airmen, soldiers, sailors, special operators, and Marines. Armies, in particular, depend on size to gain and occupy ground. Militaries can also be a tool of domestic repression, a focus that undercuts its capabilities against an external foe. North Korea, for example, is one of the world's most repressive states, led by a dictator who has repeatedly threatened neighboring South Korea.\n\nThe number of active-duty military personnel is far from the only factor that matters when comparing military power between countries, but it shows latent power that could be augmented via conscription and calling up reservists.\n\n\"Numbers have value, but there's a lot more to military capability,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and national security think tank.\n\nIISS, a London-headquartered think tank, counts active armed forces, reservists, and paramilitaries as separate categories in its analysis, showing a fuller picture of each nation's manpower.\n\nSome countries have significantly higher numbers of reservists than others — Vietnam has the largest number in the world, estimated at 5 million.\n\nBut while reservists can aid militaries when needed, the quality and longevity of their expertise can vary between conscription- and volunteer-based systems, Cancian told Business Insider.\n\n\"When you look at some countries' reserve numbers, you're often looking at people who haven't trained in 10 or 20 years,\" he said. \"It gives you a big number, but their military value is questionable.\"\n\nAnd while paramilitaries can be effective at enforcing internal security and party strength, Cancian says that \"as a military force, they have essentially zero value.\"\n\nEven when accounting for all of a military's manpower, personnel is only one of the various factors that can qualify a nation's military strength, which also include equipment and readiness.\n\nThere's also the role of technologies in global warfare, the size and sophistication of air forces and naval fleets, amphibious capabilities to land assault forces, command and control systems, or nuclear forces, which all shape military power. Larger and more advanced forces require higher state expenditures.\n\nStill, comparing global manpower offers insight into how countries prioritize military power.\n\nSee how the world's largest militaries stack up.",

    "description": "Hisham Alrayes, CEO of GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models to spread AI's gains across its economy.",
    "fullText": "Open source — that might be the clearest signal of how China wants artificial intelligence to reshape its economy.\n\nHisham Alrayes, the group CEO of Bahrain-based GFH Financial Group, said China is prioritizing open models and broad deployment to spread AI's gains across the economy, instead of funneling them to a few tech giants.\n\nSpeaking at a Davos panel on China's \"AI+ Economy\" strategy on Wednesday, Alrayes said the country's approach reflects a fundamentally different economic philosophy.\n\n\"You look at the open structure of the China AI philosophy — then you have the non-open structure,\" Alrayes said. \"That signals that the benefit they want to see is to trickle down into the economy, into the companies.\"\n\nChina's most prominent AI breakout, DeepSeek, reflects that philosophy.\n\nIt mostly uses open-source models that have drawn global attention, in contrast to many large US language models that remain closed and proprietary, reaping the benefits of tightly controlled commercial ecosystems.\n\nMeta's former chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, has said that a key reason behind DeepSeek's success is its open-source model, which, he said, can outperform proprietary models in terms of efficiency and innovation by building on shared research.\n\nMeanwhile, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said that China's open-source AI models could gain an edge globally because they're free, making them more attractive than costly proprietary US systems for governments and countries that can't afford closed models.\n\nSimilarly, Alrayes said, China — in pursuing the open model — is aiming for affordability and scale.\n\n\"It's not the benefit of that company, of that product, the return of that individual. It's not an individual — it's an economy,\" Alrayes said.\n\nThat philosophy is reflected in China's national \"AI Plus\" action plan, which prioritizes diffusion, said fellow panelist Gong Ke, executive director of the Chinese Institute for New Generation AI Development Strategies at Nankai University.\n\nThe policy, he said, focuses on embedding AI across manufacturing, healthcare, finance, education, and other sectors, rather than on breakthroughs such as artificial general intelligence.\n\nHe added that the plan sets explicit adoption targets, with AI agents and intelligent terminals expected to reach 70% penetration by 2027 and 90% by 2030.\n\nAlrayes said China's open-source tilt ultimately reflects a broader goal: making AI an economic utility rather than a profit center for a small group of companies.\n\n\"China is looking to create value throughout the economy, very clear, with very specific objectives across the economy,\" he said. \"Not just as a benefit to those companies. This is the difference in the philosophy.\"",

    "description": "Ryanair and Michael O'Leary have a long history of making provocative statements and insulting passengers as a promotional strategy.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk might have just walked straight into a trap.\n\nRyanair's marketing team and CEO Michael O'Leary have spent years courting controversy as a promotional strategy. Provoking the world's richest person might win them the most attention yet.\n\nWhat started as a critique of Musk's Starlink has proliferated into a weeklong war of words. The salvos included the pair calling each other idiots, before the airline launched a \"Big 'Idiot' Sale\" with $23 tickets.\n\nMusk may well be known for being outspoken and his attempts at humor, but in O'Leary, he's going up against a master who has played the role for decades.\n\nBirgir Jónsson, a former CEO of Icelandic budget airline Play, said he's a \"big admirer\" of O'Leary.\n\n\"He never misses an opportunity to stay on brand and remind customers that they are getting the best deal,\" he told Business Insider. \"Poor Elon Musk never knew what hit him and is now inadvertently helping Ryanair promote its January sale.\"\n\nO'Leary has been CEO for over 30 years, leading Ryanair to become Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers. His 4% stake is worth over $1 billion, but he's perhaps better known for his profanity and antics.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he's doing when he says something outrageous or provocative,\" said Marc Cornelius, the founder and CEO of 8020 Communications. \"Annoyingly, it saves him millions in PR and advertising because he instantly creates must-write stories.\"\n\nUnlike US budget airlines, such as its inspiration, Southwest Airlines, Ryanair is turning a healthy profit with an average airfare of around 40 euros ($47).\n\nAs well as selling add-ons and being strict about luggage allowances, Ryanair keeps costs low by focusing on quick turnarounds between flights. Boeing builds planes for Ryanair with fold-out stairs so passengers can deplane without waiting for airport ground workers.\n\n\"You might not love them, but they know that and are fine with it,\" Cornelius told Business Insider.\n\n\"O'Leary has been a stuntman for decades,\" said Rob Britton, a former American Airlines executive and adjunct professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business.\n\nThe best-known example came in 2009, when O'Leary told the BBC he was considering installing a coin slot on bathroom doors so passengers would have to spend £1 ($1.34) to use them.\n\n\"Was he serious? Was he kidding? The whole controversy stayed in the news for weeks, if not months,\" Britton told Business Insider.\n\nHe also pointed to how, in 2003, O'Leary was reported to have bought a taxi license, so he could drive it through Dublin's bus lanes and avoid traffic.\n\nOver the years, O'Leary has disparaged several nationalities and regularly derides politicians. According to The Guardian, he once said: \"The airline industry is full of bullshitters, liars and drunks. We excel at all three in Ireland.\"\n\nHowever, his blunt style doesn't seem to be a round-the-clock habit.\n\nHans Jørgen Elnæs, an aviation analyst and advisor who spent a year working at Ryanair between 2015 and 2016, told Business Insider, \"That is his personality when in business mode, and he gets away with it all the time.\"\n\nBut away from business, he said, O'Leary \"is not a gladiator but a really good fellow.\"\n\nIn the feud with Musk, the Irishman has made clear that — at least from his corner — it's lighthearted teasing.\n\n\"As long as it increases Ryanair bookings […] it's all good fun and entertainment,\" he said in a Wednesday press conference.\n\n\"I have four teenage children, so there is nothing that Elon Musk can say to me that my teenage kids haven't already said to me,\" he added. \"I'm well able to take my own medicine.\"\n\nO'Leary also said he's continuing discussions with Starlink and other in-flight WiFi providers.\n\nRyanair is not just a one-man show, though.\n\nElnæs said O'Leary is \"no longer alone,\" thanks to the airline's social media team.\n\nRyanair's X account helped egg on Musk. The billionaire replied to its posts undermining the efficacy of in-flight WiFi, and a press release announcing the sale.\n\nPosts mocking its own passengers often go viral, too. A frequent target is anyone who mentions leg room. Tag the airline, and you risk a flippant roast.\n\n\"By openly making fun of their customers, they reinforce that same value-for-money message in a way that cuts through the noise and stays unmistakably on brand,\" Jonsson said.\n\n2007 called, they want their jeans back https://t.co/T7Bn3MVEBc\n\nRyanair didn't respond to a request for comment on its marketing strategy.\n\nMusk's main quip came when he polled X users on whether he should purchase Ryanair and install a CEO named Ryan. But European Union regulations mean the bloc's airlines must be majority-owned by EU nationals.\n\nO'Leary's time at the helm might not last for much longer, anyway. He told the Financial Times last year that he plans to retire in the next five to 10 years.\n\n\"I don't want to hang around till 96 like Buffett,\" said the 64-year-old.\n\nCornelius, whose PR firm specializes in aviation and travel, said that Ryanair's style risks being \"a bit one-dimensional\" and misses some broader ways to engage passengers.\n\n\"They will need a different approach when Michael eventually steps down,\" he said. \"But I don't see him losing much sleep about that for now.\"",

    "description": "Tech execs and founders dished on AI bubble fears, talent war intensity, and dealmaking density at the Swiss resort.",
    "fullText": "My colleague Ben Bergman rubbed shoulders with world leaders, tech gurus, and venture capitalists in Davos this week.\n\nThere's nothing better than being in the room where it happens. I asked Ben what he saw and heard. Here are his highlights:\n\nQ: What was the biggest tech thing that was talked about at Davos this year?\n\nIt's hard to compete with President Trump and Greenland, but aside from that, AI was what everyone was talking about.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion about when businesses will start to see productivity gains that justify their huge AI spend and whether we are in a bubble.\n\nQ: What tech discussion/theme surprised you at Davos?\n\nWalking down the main thoroughfare in Davos is always a highlight because all the shops that are open the rest of the year are taken over this week by companies that host \"houses\" to showcase their brands and host clients and events.\n\nIt is interesting to see who's here and who's not.\n\nDavos is not a tech conference, and I've usually thought of it as being more dominated by finance and blue-chip companies.\n\nWalking along the street this year, 80% of the houses were tech. Palantir and Meta (with its free hot chocolate stand) had the most visible presence. Amazon's house was surprisingly small. Google was far away from the main action. Lightspeed was the only venture capital firm I saw, with its odd retro \"Lighthouse.\"\n\nIt is also interesting to see who was not here. OpenAI has no house, and Sam Altman did not come, though some executives are here. Elon Musk was not originally part of the program but was a last-minute addition on Thursday.\n\nQ: What was the tone of the tech executives and tech investors there?\n\nIf executives and investors are worried about the future, they did not share that with me or on stage.\n\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang described what is happening with AI as \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" and not only that, but said it will drive job creation across the global economy.\n\nQ: What was the biggest concern expressed by tech executives and tech investors at Davos this year?\n\nWhile optimism ruled the week, the fear of being in an AI bubble was on everyone's mind.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella warned onstage Tuesday that there would be a bubble if the only companies using AI are other AI companies.\n\n\"For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,\" Nadella said.\n\nHuang cited the rising rental price of computer chips as evidence that we are not in a bubble.\n\n\"If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs,\" he said.\n\nAnother concern from tech executives I spoke to was how hard it is to hire and retain top talent right now, especially as big AI labs spend like drunken sailors to hire.\n\n\"It's astronomical amounts of money at the big level,\" Winston Weinberg, CEO and co-founder of Harvey, told me. He said he spends 70% of his time on hiring.\n\n\"I'm super involved, and I think it's the most important thing at our company right now, Weinberg said.\n\nQ: Anything else tech folks should know from your time there?\n\nThere were so many techies here that sometimes I felt like I was in San Francisco.\n\nI asked a couple of startup founders why they came so far to be here, and the consensus was that there's nothing like Davos for the efficiency of meeting potential customers and investors who are all packed into a tiny Swiss village for the week.\n\nWaiting in the cold in a long line for a party for General Catalyst and Lightspeed, I asked one founder why he traveled here.\n\nHe told me Alexandr Wang, founder and former CEO of Scale AI, who is now chief AI officer at Meta, advised him Davos was highly useful because Wang last year said he signed almost a third of Scale's customers in the short time he was here.\n\nWeinberg told me that dealmaking started even before I arrived, with many transactions happening in the business-class sections of flights to Zurich from San Francisco and New York.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "TikTok CEO Shou Chew sent a memo to staff celebrating the \"good news\" that the company had finalized a deal to keep its business operating in the US.",
    "fullText": "The TikTok divestment deal is done, and the company's CEO is jubilant.\n\nOn Thursday, TikTok's top boss, Shou Chew, sent a message to US staffers, toasting the \"great news\" and thanking them for their \"resilience.\"\n\nHe also announced that \"more than 200 million Americans now come to TikTok to be entertained, learn, and grow their business with a broader global community.\"\n\nChew has good reason to take a victory lap.\n\nAfter battling for the company's survival for over a year and a half, TikTok now has confidence it will avoid a US ban after its owner ByteDance sold off enough of its business to meet the demands of a 2024 sell-or-ban law.\n\nThe deal is a major win for TikTok and ByteDance, which will be able to continue operating in the US without having to disconnect US users from the rest of the world. The arrangement is also a victory for TikTok's new US investors, a hodgepodge of investment firms and individuals like Michael Dell, who get a stake in a fast-growing business.\n\nThe deal involved setting up a joint venture with an investor consortium that now owns just over 80% of the new US entity. The group, led by managing investors Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX, is tasked with securing US user data, content moderation, and trust and safety.\n\nByteDance, meanwhile, gets around 20% ownership in the new venture. It will also maintain control of key TikTok business lines, such as e-commerce, marketing, and advertising. The company is splitting up its US employees into different entities based on whether they'll stay under ByteDance's wing or work for the new joint venture, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.\n\nThe closing of the joint venture agreement is the culmination of a half-decade saga for TikTok, which initially faced the prospect of a ban in 2020 under President Donald Trump's first administration. The court blocked Trump's efforts to ban TikTok, but the app was targeted again in a 2024 law known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.\n\nTikTok lost its legal challenge to the law in the Supreme Court a year ago, and it was only able to continue operating in 2025 due to a series of executive orders from Trump, who chose to preserve TikTok rather than destroy it.\n\nMoving forward, Chew will continue to run TikTok globally, while trust and safety executive Adam Presser will oversee the US joint venture. TikTok staffers will need to \"continue to follow data privacy, content assurance, code compliance, and trust and safety protocols\" that were already in place, Chew wrote in his memo.\n\nI am pleased to update you with some great news.\n\nToday, TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC has been established in compliance with the Executive Order signed by President Trump on September 25, 2025, enabling our US users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok's vibrant global community and experience.\n\nAs we take this significant step forward, I am proud to share that today more than 200 million Americans now come to TikTok to be entertained, learn, and grow their business with a broader global community. We are grateful for the incredible support of our user base, and the unwavering dedication and resilience of our employees that has allowed us to continue delivering at a high level.\n\nTikTok's growth in the US nicely sets up the Joint Venture for strong future success. The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for US users. It will be led by Adam Presser who, today, has been chosen by the Joint Venture's Board of Directors for his impressive track record with the company leading large-scale teams in the areas of Trust & Safety and Operations. Please find more details on today's news here.\n\nInteroperability will be critical in enabling users and creators to have the same global experience that they know and love, and for the 7.5 million US businesses to continue to thrive on TikTok by reaching customers around the world. To ensure this continuity for our users, new subsidiaries including \"TT Commerce & Global Services LLC,\" have been created to manage global product interoperability as well as commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\n\nTo date, we have provided compliance training for all TikTok employees. Going forward when working with the newly created USDS JV, I expect everyone to continue to follow data privacy, content assurance, code compliance, and trust and safety protocols.\n\nI thank you all for the tireless work you do every single day in fulfilling our mission to inspire creativity and bring joy.",

    "description": "Despite being a frequent cruiser, I made a mistake on a recent sailing by booking a room on the Regal Princess that was too small for my family.",
    "fullText": "As our family's primary vacation planner, I've found we get the most mileage out of cruises. The \"most things included\" pricing is easy on our budget, and we like the wide range of activities and dining options.\n\nMy kids are in high school, and we've been cruising together since they were in first grade. Still, I managed to make a rookie mistake with our most recent seven-night Western Caribbean Princess cruise.\n\nI had booked it while on a Princess Alaskan cruise with my husband and got a great rate. However, I had a moment of panic when we boarded the Regal Princess weeks later and got a first look at our stateroom.\n\nAlthough I'd selected a \"cabin that sleeps four,\" I only saw two twin beds.\n\nDespite the initial shock, we quickly realized our 222-square-foot cabin could indeed sleep four people. Our steward told us there were two additional beds stored in the ceiling that he would pull out every evening.\n\nWe asked if the two twin beds on the ground could be converted into a queen for my husband and me, and were told they could, but there would be no place to put the ladder for the upper bunks.\n\nSo, we left the arrangement as it was.\n\nOn the bright side, we had sufficient sleeping space, and my kids didn't have to share a bed. Our steward set up the beds each evening while we were at dinner and put them up again after breakfast.\n\nDespite being small, the beds were comfortable, and we all got decent sleep.\n\nThe biggest issue was that there was no room to sit up and read or watch TV in bed — the upper bunk was that close to the ceiling. The ladders also made moving around the cabin a game of Tetris, especially at night.\n\nCasualties included one head bump (me, the first night) and one kid stepping on my legs when he skipped the ladder. After that, we adjusted.\n\nOn the bright side, having a small balcony (albeit one with an obstructed view of the ocean) meant we had easy access to natural light, fresh air, and a bit of extra space, which made a difference.\n\nIn the end, we got a good enough discount on the room that I didn't mind a little extra inconvenience.\n\nThough I would've liked a bigger bed and more room, our small stateroom didn't stop us from enjoying the cruise. We were only in the room to sleep and shower, and after a day or two, the bunks didn't feel like a big deal.\n\nThis was the first time my kids had sailed on Princess, and our postcard-sized digs didn't affect how we felt about the cruise overall.\n\nWe'd 1000% do this cruise with teenagers again — just not in this stateroom.\n\nLooking back, I can see what led me to choose the wrong cabin for our family.\n\nWhile booking with a sales rep on a previous cruise, I got caught up in the moment and the good deal. I didn't think to ask detailed questions, like the specifics of the bed arrangements.\n\nMy biggest mistake was assuming. On cruises I've been on with Disney and Carnival, cabins that sleep four are configured differently, with a queen bed and a couch that converts into bunks across the room.\n\nI should've asked more questions and watched fellow cruisers' cabin tour videos online before booking anything. Had I done that, I likely would've chosen a different cabin or adjusted my reservation before our departure.\n\nNext time, I'd be more prepared, or just book my cruise at home, where it'd be easier to review the details on my own.\n\nA travel advisor familiar with cruising could also have steered us toward a better option for a family of four with teens. Though I recommend them to first-timers, I don't usually use one for cruises.\n\nAt the end of the day, even though I should have known better, I couldn't help but laugh at myself.",

Here's his review:\n\nPersonal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook.\n\nWith my permission, Gemini can tap into my Google account — Gmail, Photos, Search history, YouTube, and more — and reason across all of it to answer questions the way a human assistant might, except this one has years of receipts on my life.\n\nThis is something I've wanted since AI-powered chatbots blew up in late 2022. Back then, I'd pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer. Then, the bot would immediately forget I existed, like a genius goldfish. Over the last few years, OpenAI and Anthropic have enabled their chatbots to connect to services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. But Google has home field advantage: it already has the broadest view of what you've actually done, searched, watched, and saved.\n\nGemini's ability to connect the dots is scary-good, well beyond what ChatGPT or Claude can do. When I asked it for sightseeing ideas for my parents, who have already visited the Bay Area a few times, it suggested museums and gardens, correctly inferring they've already done hikes and trips to redwood forests.\n\nWhen I asked Gemini how it knew, it told me it deduced this based on \"breadcrumbs\" left across my Google account: Family emails, photos of Muir Woods, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for \"easy hikes for seniors.\"\n\nThis is so powerful that Google is already trying to preempt the freak-out. VP Josh Woodward said Google takes \"steps to filter or obfuscate personal data\" from the conversations we have with Gemini.\n\n\"We don't train our systems to learn your license plate number; we train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it,\" he wrote recently.\n\nSo, I asked it for my license plate number and it was able to locate it, based on photos of my car in Google Photos.\n\nI also asked Gemini when my car insurance was up for renewal and it correctly told me, based on emails from AAA in my Gmail inbox.\n\nWhen I asked it to help me plan an upcoming trip, it accounted for the fact that we're traveling with an infant — because it already knows we have a new baby. Of course it does.\n\nThis is the future every AI company keeps promising. Last year, Meta said its new north star wasn't \"the metaverse\" — that alternate VR universe the company is literally named after — but \"personal superintelligence,\" an AI that \"knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.\"\n\nOne path to that vision: AI-powered glasses that can see and hear what you see and hear, turning everyday life into the raw material for an always-on assistant. To get there, Meta has poured billions of dollars into a hiring spree and into the data centers needed to run it all.\n\nBut Meta doesn't have a digital record of my life like Google does. I barely post on Facebook. I mostly swipe through Instagram Reels. WhatsApp is encrypted. And after Meta killed Supernatural, my favorite VR workout app, I have very little reason to use its Quest headset anymore.\n\nMeta talks about \"personal superintelligence\" as a future goal. As far as I'm concerned, Google just shipped it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Intel is the latest AI chipmaker to buckle under the weight of massive expectations",
    "description": "Intel reported earnings that beat estimates, but flagged issue with manufacturing that weighed on the outlook for coming quarters.",
    "fullText": "The move: Intel stock fell 17% on Friday. The chipmaker is up 23% year-to-date and up 119% in 12 months.\n\nWhy: Intel's drop comes after its latest earnings results missed investors' lofty expectations.\n\nWhile the company slightly beat analysts' estimates for both adjusted earnings per share and revenue, it issued soft sales guidance for the quarter. The company said it expects revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion for the current quarter, below expectations of $12.51 billion.\n\nIntel CFO David Zinsner attributed the tepid guidance to the company's inability to keep up with demand for its products, citing production issues. He told CNBC that he expects this issue to improve in the coming quarters, but CEO Lip-Bu Tan said on the chip maker's earnings call that a true turnaround would require \"time and resolve.\"\n\nWhat it means: Intel's stock drop comes as investors are laser-focused on what's next for the AI trade. For Intel specifically, while the nod to high demand is encouraging, investors are concerned that the company's turnaround isn't happening as fast as they hoped.\n\nThe stock has been on a wild journey in the last year, with the Trump administration taking a 10% stake and Nvidia pouring $5 billion into the company, which provided a fresh boost to the beaten-down shares. But Intel executives' comments on the earnings call suggest a longer road ahead before its turnaround is complete.\n\nWhile the move down on Friday was company-specific, rather than an indicator of the wider AI trade, it's also a reminder that many high-flying tech and AI names are priced to perfection, and any miss on expectations is enough to send the stock tumbling.",

    "fullText": "The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center is located on Dulles Airport property in Chantilly, Virginia, and the observation tower is its highest structure.\n\nParking costs $15, but admission to the museum is free.\n\nWhen I visited in January, the observation tower closed at 4:30 p.m., an hour before the rest of the museum closed at 5:30 p.m.\n\nThe observation tower was my last stop after touring the rest of the museum, so I was grateful for the chance to sit and rest my feet in the waiting area.\n\nAfter a short elevator ride, I arrived at the top of the tower.\n\nLooking down at the museum's 10-story aviation and space hangars from above showed me just how large the entire complex is: 760,000 square feet, to be exact.\n\nAn informational plaque indicated that the Bull Run and Catoctin mountain ranges were 12 miles away, and the Blue Ridge mountains were 23 miles away.\n\nI could see planes taking off and landing at the airport, with some planes passing directly over the observation tower. On a clearer day, I likely would have been able to see more aircraft in the sky.\n\nPlanes take off into the wind for extra lift. Landing into the wind helps them reduce speed.\n\nI could hear air traffic controllers instructing flights to turn certain directions or use certain runways at Dulles, but much of it was jargon meant for pilots.\n\nThe exhibit included a lighting control panel depicting airport runway layouts known as a \"mimic,\" a vacuum tube from a vintage communication radio, and a light gun used to communicate with pilots via lighting signals if radio isn't available.\n\nWhile touring the museum, my guide pointed out the Boeing 367-80 Jet Transport known as \"Dash 80.\" The only model of its kind ever built, the Dash 80 first took off in 1954 and was eventually developed into the first Boeing 707 jetliner, ushering in a new era of commercial air travel.\n\nAfter viewing the museum's vast collection of historic planes, watching passenger jets take off and land at Dulles gave me a deeper appreciation of how much — and how quickly — aviation has changed. I was glad I'd saved the best for last.",

    "description": "The crowd gasped after a tense handshake between Naomi Osaka and Sorana Cîrstea. The discomfort says a lot about how we view women competitors.",
    "fullText": "When Naomi Osaka walked away from a post-match handshake at the Australian Open on Thursday, the moment was visibly tense. What happened between her and her opponent, Romanian player Sorana Cîrstea? Was it someone's attitude? Was it poor sportsmanship? Was it even necessary?\n\nWhat didn't seem to get nearly as much attention: Osaka, 28, was intensely competing in one of the biggest tennis matches in the world. And she wasn't backing down. It worked for her because it's the first time Osaka had reached the third round at the Australian Open since 2022. She's back on the court Saturday against Maddison Inglis.\n\nIn a post-match interview, the moment got even more icy. When asked what it took to win, Osaka was unmoved and unapologetic.\n\n\"Apparently a lot of 'come ons' that she was angry about,\" she said, in reference to how she was hyping herself up before serves. \"She's a great player. I think this was her last Australian Open. Sorry she was mad about it.\"\n\nNaomi Osaka on the icy handshake with Sorana Cirstea at the Australian Open\n\n“What did it take to get through that one?”\n\nNaomi: “Apparently a lot of come ons that she was angry about. Whatever. She’s a great player. I think this was her last Australian Open. Sorry she was mad… pic.twitter.com/uCODMBfnKD\n\nThe crowd gasped. It cheered. It even booed. The discomfort that followed said more about how society responds to competitive women than about what's deemed proper tennis etiquette. In high-stakes environments, women are expected to compete and succeed, but only within narrow emotional boundaries.\n\n\"When women show up in competition the same way men do, people don't know where to put it,\" said Chelsea Brown, founder of The Black Mill Consulting, who works with executives navigating power dynamics at work. \"Instead of focusing on performance, the attention shifts to tone, demeanor, or perceived attitude.\"\n\nBrown pointed out that instead of focusing on Osaka's performance, the conversation fixated on a gesture and her tone that can't be measured or quantified.\n\n\"It's petty,\" she added, \"and it's telling. If this were a man in a sport where aggression is celebrated the reaction would be completely different.\"\n\nThe double standard certainly isn't confined to sports. In corporate America, the same dynamics play out daily.\n\nMen are often praised for being decisive and commanding; women who exhibit these traits can be labeled difficult, emotional, or abrasive. The result? Women are scrutinized, not just for outcomes, but for how comfortable they make others feel along the way.\n\n\"There are still deeply embedded sexist practices in corporate culture,\" Brown said. \"You see it in pay gaps, promotions, hiring decisions, and in the way women's intensity is constantly questioned or explained away.\"\n\nThe pressure to soften is often framed as leadership coaching or — my favorite — the spirit of collaboration. But Brown warned that dialing down ambition or authority comes at a cost. \"When women make themselves smaller or palatable, it limits how their power is perceived and how seriously their leadership is taken.\"\n\nOsaka's moment resonated precisely because it refused that trade-off. Her response wasn't performative. It was human.\n\nAnd perhaps that's the real tension: We are still adjusting to a world where women on the court and in the boardroom no longer feel obligated to cushion their excellence.",

    "description": "Stylists told us which boots, sneakers, flats, heels, and loafers are in fashion and which trends are out of style as we head into the new year.",
    "fullText": "A new year is a great time to upgrade your footwear game.\n\nAs you head into 2026, perhaps you have a few pairs of shoes on your wish list, or a couple in your collection you're prepared to part with.\n\nBefore you shop your closet, head to a store, or pull out the donation bin, read on to see which shoe trends stylists predict will be in and out this year.\n\nDianne Boyer, personal stylist and founder of Dianne in Style, said this year will see a shift toward low-profile sneakers — the epitome of which are ballet sneakers.\n\nThese hybrid, slipper-like designs usually combine the rounded, delicate look of a ballet flat with the athletic sole of a typical sneaker.\n\n\"Ballet sneakers blend the elegance of a flat with the support of a sneaker,\" Boyer said. \"The low-profile elongates the leg, and the structured stole provides the lift, making them both flattering and easy to wear.\n\n\"They go perfectly with the new refined looks of 2026,\" she added.\n\nSlip-on loafers are in this year because they combine ease with polish, celebrity stylist Anna Lavo said.\n\n\"In a few words, backless loafers are the definition of 'effortless sophistication,\" she told BI.\n\nThe loafer shape keeps the shoe structured and classic, while the slip-on element makes it seem more modern and effortless.\n\n\"They are perfect for the way people are dressing now — relaxed but still intentional,\" Lavo added.\n\nYou may have a pair of these boots sitting in the back of your closet from when you dressed up for Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour, but you'll want to whip them back out in 2026.\n\n\"Western-style boots, tall and short, are in every designer's line this year,\" Desiree Miranda, a New York City and Miami-based celebrity stylist, told BI.\n\nIf you're going to dabble with this trend, you may want to start with two options.\n\n\"I suggest purchasing a tall western-style boot along with a shorter style, as they're comfortable and easily take you from day to night,\" Miranda said.\n\nAllie Carter, a New York City-based personal stylist, said that Mary Janes won't be leaving the fashion scene this year.\n\n\"Mary Jane flats are still going strong, especially those with luxe details and satin embellishments,\" she told BI.\n\nThese closed-toe shoes with a signature strap across the top are pretty versatile and come in both solid colors and prints across a range of fabrics.\n\nFor example, leather or bejeweled styles can be dressed up for work or a special occasion, and patterned Mary Janes can add whimsy to a day-to-day look.\n\nAccording to Boyer, classic bright-white sneakers are not \"the trend-forward choice\" this year.\n\n\"There's more of a shift toward richer colors and textures — especially suede — and more intentional designs,\" she said. \"The look for 2026 is more elevated and polished, and the bright white can feel over the top.\"\n\nInstead, you may want to try sneakers in cream, light gray, or other neutral shades, made with fabrics other than the usual canvas or leather.\n\nStill, Boyer said, white sneakers are a great wardrobe staple. Trends are always changing, so she wouldn't get rid of any pairs of these just yet.\n\nPlatforms that are excessively chunky or disproportionately thick may start to look extra clunky and dated this year.\n\n\"The era of big and bulky shoes has officially ended,\" Lavo told BI. \"When a shoe's sole becomes the focal point, it stops supporting the outfit.\"\n\nOkerulu said that platforms are just \"not practical\" unless you're on the shorter side and want to gain a few inches, plus they don't offer much comfort and can be difficult to style.\n\nInstead, according to Lavo, more people may opt for shoes with more \"balanced proportions\" that can make an outfit feel harmonious.",

    "fullText": "Elle Fanning is almost as well known for her style as she is for her acting résumé.\n\nThe actor, who just earned her first Oscar nomination for her performance in \"Sentimental Value,\" is often included in best-dressed lists, from her on-theme Met Gala outfits to glamorous awards show ensembles.\n\nFanning has also experimented with daring looks as her career has progressed, wearing gowns with plunging necklines and embracing sheer fabric.\n\nCheck out some of Fanning's most daring looks to date.\n\nShe paired the halter top with a pink jacket and an orange skirt. A white bag and black heels completed the look.\n\nFanning's green silk Gucci gown was almost entirely sheer and embroidered with sparkly floral detailing.\n\nOversize flowers decorated the hem of the dress.\n\nThe Alexander McQueen dress was covered in delicate lace, and the sheer, dropped-waist corset offset the high-low skirt.\n\nShe accessorized the look with sparkly pink heels.\n\nThe dress was covered in oversize sequins and featured a plunging neckline and midriff cutout.\n\nFanning matched her silver heels to the crystal-lined neckline detail of the Miu Miu dress.\n\nThe sparkly navy dress had a deep neckline trimmed with pink and silver stripes.\n\nShe accessorized the dress with red satin heels.\n\nThe gown had a full skirt and train, as well as ruffled sleeves.\n\nFanning wore Chopard jewelry and Sophia Webster shoes at the \"Les Misérables\" premiere.\n\nThe dress hit Fanning at her ankles, and both the skirt and the plunging neckline were trimmed with ruffled fabric.\n\nShe paired the floral-print dress with pointed metallic silver heels.\n\nThe pale-pink dress from Miu Miu featured sequins on the halter bodice, which formed cutouts on the sides. The tulle skirt flowed to the floor and featured subtle sparkles.\n\nFanning wore the gown with Tiffany & Co. jewelry.\n\nFanning's flared jumpsuit featured a fun petal cutout on the bodice. She paired the black ensemble with a floral Gucci choker and black heels.\n\nFanning's Gucci dress had an open back, a high neckline, and a full skirt.\n\nThe actor's Balmain top, designed to look like a gold chain, left Fanning's back completely open.\n\nShe wore the top with a low-rise, black skirt.\n\nThe cream dress was designed with ruffles and floral embroidery. It flared around Fanning's hips, cinching in again for an asymmetrical look.\n\nCutouts decorated the dress, and the sweetheart neckline sat low on Fanning's chest. Gold shoes completed the look.\n\nThe bodysuit's top looked like a bra, and sheer black lace covered Fanning's stomach.\n\nShe paired the daring top with black, wide-legged pants, a matching jacket, and silver shoes.\n\nThe Georges Chakra dress hugged Fanning's figure, and it was embroidered with textured embellishments.\n\nThe draped neckline scooped all the way to Fanning's navel, and she wore gold shoes with the look.\n\nFor the \"Garden of Time\" Met Gala, Fanning wore a form-fitting dress with a neckline that flowed into birds on each shoulder.\n\nThe glass-like material was see-through, and it flowed into a tulle train.\n\nThe long-sleeve Gucci gown was covered in a sunflower pattern from head to toe.\n\nThe gauzy sleeves and skirt flowed around Fanning, offsetting the plunging neckline that cinched her waist.\n\nFanning chose a loose-fitting suit from Saint Laurent for the event.\n\nThe single-button jacket bared her chest, and she paired the black suit with pointed-toe heels.\n\nDior designed her knee-length black dress, which cinched at the waist and was framed by cutouts on the sides.\n\nThe neckline formed a deep V, and the latex sleeves formed gloves. Black heels completed the look.\n\nThe sage-green dress from Valentino featured long sleeves and a low neckline, and the hem and sleeves were trimmed with fuzzy fabric.\n\nFanning wore a coordinating shrug over the gown, adding volume to the look.\n\nThe deep-green dress had an A-line silhouette, and the bodice was made of crisscrossing fabric, creating subtle cutouts.\n\nThe pleated skirt was semi-sheer, showing glimpses of Fanning's legs throughout the night.\n\nThe column dress had a square neckline trimmed with silver embellishments and a bow in the center.\n\nThe straps were made of the same fabric and flowed onto Fanning's back in a square pattern.\n\nA delicate train flowed out, adding glamour to the look.\n\nFanning's dress for the 2025 Golden Globes featured a leopard bodice, and she nodded to the look with her vintage Dior gown at the after-party.\n\nThe form-fitting dress had spaghetti straps adorned with red bows and a thigh-high slit cut up the skirt. A coordinating scarf completed the sultry look.\n\nFanning attended the conference in a black Givenchy suit designed by Sarah Burton.\n\nThe fitted blazer and trousers were simple, but underneath, Fanning wore a cropped top that hugged her rib cage and had a bra-style bodice with a cutout in the center.\n\nShe paired the chic suit with neon yellow, pointed-toe heels and loose waves.\n\nThe black Zuhair Murad dress Fanning wore to the premiere had a sweetheart neckline and spaghetti straps. The skirt fell to the floor, and a dramatic slit cut all the way up her thigh to show off her black heels.\n\nA ribbon of fabric cut across the bodice, mirroring another swath that trailed behind her in a modern spin on a train.\n\nFanning wore her hair in an elegant updo, which drew attention to the Cartier choker around her neck.\n\nIn January 2026, Fanning attended the Critics Choice Awards, where she was nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in \"Sentimental Value.\"\n\nShe wore a 2003 archival Ralph Lauren gown for the event. The gold dress had a cowl neckline that scooped low, revealing nearly all of Fanning's torso, and it dipped even lower in the back.\n\nThe glittering dress hugged her figure before flaring out into a subtle train at the hem. Fanning kept her accessories simple with the gown, letting it shine.",

    "description": "Gross equity issuance, or the amount of stock issued by companies and snapped up by investors, has risen sharply leading up to past market peaks.",
    "fullText": "One research firm says it's spotted a new red flag in the AI trade that suggests the bubble is close to bursting.\n\nThat would be the rising amount of equity issuance — or the volume of stock being sold by companies and snapped up by investors, according to Capital Economics.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, the research firm pointed to how gross equity issuance has been rising sharply in the US in recent years, thanks to the frenzy for artificial intelligence. That's a feature that traditionally been seen in past market bubble peaks, Joe Maher, a markets economist at the firm, said.\n\nGross equity issuance by non-financial US firms now looks higher or at similar levels when compared to the dot-com bubble, the period leading up to the Great Financial Crisis, and the pandemic stock rally, per Capital Economics' analysis.\n\n\"One warning sign that a bubble is close to bursting is high and rising gross equity issuance,\" Maher wrote. \"There are myriad of reasons why these rallies faltered, but one factor may have been that surging share issuance eventually overwhelmed investors' appetite for stocks, helping to push stock prices lower,\" he later added.\n\nThat's not to say the AI trade doesn't have room to climb higher. When accounting for historically high stock valuations, equity issuance isn't as extreme as it looks, Maher said.\n\nMeanwhile, corporations have been executing large-scale stock buybacks, so net equity issuance as a whole remains negative.\n\nNet equity issuance turned positive around the time the dot-com bubble, 2007 stock rally, and the pandemic stock rally peaked, Maher added, calling positive equity issuance a \"harbinger\" of a rally reaching its climax.\n\nNet equity issuance could rise this year, should companies like SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic go public as expected, Maher said. Many tech firms are also tapping into private capital, and rising equity issuance in private markets could also be a sign that the AI bubble is close to popping, he suggested.\n\n\"With a rising share of issuance taking place in private markets, warnings signs that the AI bubble is close to bursting may also emerge there,\" Maher wrote.\n\nMost forecasters on Wall Street expect continued gains in the market in 2026, but investors have been feeling increasingly nervous about a stock bubble, given the market's enormous returns in recent years. Capital Economics, for its part, has predicted that the tech stock bubble would burst in 2026 for the past several years.",

    "description": "The Amazon founder wrote on X that he was \"not sure\" why the prediction market platform \"made this up.\"",
    "fullText": "Jeff Bezos is setting the record straight.\n\nThe Amazon founder and executive chairman took to X on Thursday and accused the prediction platform Polymarket of fabricating a statement attributed to him.\n\n\"JUST IN: Jeff Bezos advises aspiring Gen Z entrepreneurs to start at real world jobs like McDonalds or Palantir before starting a business,\" read the Polymarket post.\n\nBezos replied: \"Nope. Not sure why polymarket made this up.\"\n\nNope. Not sure why polymarket made this up. 🤷‍♂️\n\nIt's not entirely clear where the statement came from. The Polymarket account on X frequently posts aggregated news from around the world, often without citing an original source.\n\nPolymarket did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nBezos did recently speak about about the importance of real-world experience in general.\n\nIn an appearance at Italian Tech Week in November, Bezos advised young entrepreneurs to work at a company before starting their own, rather than dropping out of college like other famous founders.\n\n\"It is possible to, you know, be 18, 19, 20 years old, drop out of college, and be a great entrepreneur,\" Bezos said. \"We have famous examples of that working: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etcetera. But these people are the exception.\"\n\n\"I always advise to young people, you know, go work at a best practices company somewhere, where you can learn a lot of basic fundamental things,\" Bezos continued. \"There's still lots of time to start a company after you have absorbed it. It increases your odds, in my opinion.\"\n\nBezos also worked his first job at McDonald's while in high school, and he spoke favorably about the experience in comments that appeared in the 2012 book \"Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's.\"\n\n\"You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously,\" Bezos said. \"You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's. It's different from what you learn in school. Don't underestimate the value of that!\"\n\nElon Musk even weighed in, replying to Bezos with a reference toward President Donald Trump's famous appearance at a McDonald's during the 2024 presidential campaign, where he worked the fryer and appeared at the drive-thru window.\n\n\"Well, the President worked at McDonald's and now he's the President,\" Musk wrote.",

    "fullText": "Is prison like the movies? The pardoned billionaire founder of Binance thinks so.\n\nChangpeng \"CZ\" Zhao pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering rules in 2023. He served four months in prison in 2024 and was pardoned by President Donald Trump in October 2025.\n\nSince then, Zhao has been \"pretty busy,\" he said in an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. He's working on a free education platform, an investment platform, and advises a dozen governments on crypto regulation, he said.\n\nEveryone wants to talk to Zhao about his prison experience, though, unless they're too afraid to ask. \"It's definitely a conversation starter,\" he said.\n\n\"My first roommate is a double murderer,\" Zhao said. \"He's been there for like twelve years, he still has 18 years to go, and then he got moved to a low-security prison.\"\n\nHe was a \"nice guy,\" Zhao added.\n\nZhao was surprised by his prison sentence, he said. He expected to be given home confinement.\n\nThe first day was \"pretty brutal,\" Zhao said. He described his strip search in detail, including prison staff searching his mouth and tongue as well as his genitalia.\n\nZhao's pardon has drawn scrutiny, with some onlookers questioning Trump's motives. Binance has promoted USD1, the stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, a crypto asset manager backed by the Trump family.\n\n\"The American people deserve transparency regarding whether the pardon power was exercised impartially or influenced by personal financial interests,\" Rep. Robert Garcia wrote in a November letter.\n\nTrump also denied knowing who Zhao is in a \"60 Minutes\" interview following the pardon.\n\nIn his CNBC interview, Zhao also appeared to position himself as removed from the process. Of the pardon procedure, he said, \"I still don't know what the process is.\"\n\nZhao said his motivation for applying for a pardon came from media coverage speculating that he could receive one. After he applied, the administration was a \"black box.\"\n\n\"What people suggested the most is: get in front of Trump yourself,\" Zhao said. \"But I never got in front of Trump. I just waited and waited and waited, and suddenly it happened.\"\n\nHas he spoken to Trump? \"No, not yet,\" Zhao said.\n\nThe closest he's gotten, he said, was Trump's \"Board of Peace\" signing in Davos. Zhao was in the audience, some 30 to 40 feet away from the president who pardoned him.\n\n\"Never talked to him,\" he said. \"Never shook hands.\"",

    "fullText": "With a major winter storm expected to hit multiple parts of the country this weekend, it's the perfect time to bring out your Crock-Pot or slow cooker to prepare hearty meals that cook on their own.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with chefs and cookbook authors about their favorite comforting slow-cooker meals, from hearty beef stews and chowders to brisket, and researched celebrity chefs' go-to Crock-Pot dishes.\n\nHere are 17 cozy comfort-food dishes you can make in a slow cooker, according to chefs.\n\nShort ribs are one of cookbook author Kim Laidlaw's favorite things to make in a Crock-Pot, and they're a go-to on a chilly day.\n\nIn her cookbook, \"Everyday Slow Cooking: Modern Recipes for Delicious Meals,\" Laidlaw gives multiple different recipes for short ribs, and she recommends trying them for a meal featuring other sides.\n\n\"If you do them in a slow cooker, then the meat is out of the way,\" she told Business Insider. \"Then, you can focus on other side dishes like polenta or risotto.\"\n\nBeef, turkey, or chicken stew is a perfect stick-to-your-bones meal during the winter months.\n\n\"Beef stew is really nice in the slow cooker,\" Laidlaw said. \"That's something I grew up on with the slow cooker, and it's just as good today.\"\n\n\"Slow cookers are perfect in the winter for soups and stews,\" Laidlaw said. \"The best part is that you can set it in the morning and walk away.\"\n\nIf you make this chowder in the fall, you can use in-season fresh corn as is suggested in this celebrity chef-approved Martha Stewart recipe, found on the chef's website.\n\nHowever, you can also take the easy route by choosing canned corn from the store. The chowder is flavorful yet light and uses heartwarming ingredients like heavy cream, bacon, and baby red potatoes.\n\nLaidlaw's recipe for slow-cooked braised brisket includes garlic, onion, dry red wine, carrot, and chicken or beef stock, with a chimichurri sauce.\n\n\"Brisket is a natural partner for the slow cooker, as a gentle braise renders it meltingly tender,\" Laidlaw writes in \"Everyday Slow Cooking.\"\n\n\"Ribs do really well in the slow cooker, and you can always stick them under the broiler in the end to crisp them up,\" Laidlaw said.\n\n\"Bolognese is great because you can cook it for a long time,\" Laidlaw said. \"You just have to remember that the sauce doesn't evaporate the same as it would if you were doing it on the stove. You definitely need to compensate and put less liquid in the pot if you're using a slow cooker.\"\n\nCelebrity chef Martha Stewart's recipe for slow-cooker mac and cheese is not only easy to make but super delicious and perfect for the fall and winter seasons.\n\n\"It is important to use pungent cheeses, such as sharp cheddar, mixed with a little Gruyere or pecorino Romano for extra bite, since the white sauce and pasta will absorb a lot of flavor,\" Stewart writes.\n\nHugh Acheson's slow-cooker chicken broth is pretty simple — all you'll need is a whole chicken, salt, garlic cloves, white onions, carrots, celery, and a few seasonings to taste.\n\nYou can find the full recipe for Acheson's chicken broth in his book, \"The Chef and the Slow Cooker.\"\n\n\"A simple soup with Thai chilis, coconut milk, and lime is just wickedly good,\" Acheson said.\n\nThe recipe for Acheson's slow cooker chicken soup with chiles, coconut milk, and lime can be found here on Garden & Gun. Or, if you're feeling a little more adventurous, Acheson also said a slow cooker is a perfect way to make delicious chicken and dumplings.\n\nAcheson points out that not only are meatballs, like the veal meatballs he includes in his book, easy and delicious to make, but they're a comforting, kid-friendly option you can make in a slow cooker.\n\n\"Slow cookers are not necessarily the best tool for cooking for one — they work so much better for nourishing an entire family,\" he said.\n\n\"I usually go for something that won't take too long,\" Acheson said. \"Usually, I go for a lentil soup with Tuscan kale and a little sour cream and herbs on top. To me, that's the type of food you want as you're watching the snow fall down.\"\n\nThe recipe for Acheson's lentil soup with Tuscan kale can be found here on Cup of Jo.\n\nAcheson also points out that large batches of soup are great for the next day.\n\nOne of the benefits of using a slow cooker is starting with a basic protein and jazzing it up.\n\nFrom Mexican food-inspired spices to Indian simmer sauces, there are tons of ways to transform simple braised or pulled chicken dishes into something show-stopping.\n\nThis recipe from Delish tells you how to make slow-cooker barbecue pulled chicken.\n\n\"One dish I think is so versatile is pork shoulder in a slow cooker with broth and a little salt and pepper,\" Laidlaw said. \"I just braise that and then you can turn into so many different things.\"\n\nLaidlaw said that using a pork shoulder, you can make everything from pulled-pork sliders to carnitas tacos or burritos.\n\n\"Leg of lamb is so good as it breaks down in the slow cooker,\" Acheson said. \"Cooking in the slow cooker and then finishing another way is going to make sure your meat is at its best. Whether that means re-searing the meat or throwing it under the broiler, you might want to think about other steps to really finish off your meal.\"\n\nLaidlaw added, \"Recipes that have you throw everything in without any prep ahead are not nearly as good or as flavorful as the ones that do. Taking ten minutes to brown the meat before you put it in or getting the onions started goes a long way to making your meals more delicious.\"\n\n\"It's really about rethinking recipes and figuring out how to do it in the slow cooker,\" Acheson said.\n\nOne of the \"best recipes\" Acheson said he uses from his book is one for a braised catfish stew, the recipe for which can be found on Garden & Gun.\n\n\"It's got this long-cooking, beautiful broth that's just a vision at the end,\" he told Business Insider. \"It's got chilies, peppers, and mace — big flavors. It just works perfectly. When slow cooking, you really want to choose a dish that works well simmering potentially all day.\"\n\n\"These days, goat shoulder doesn't have that gamey taste it might have had before,\" Acheson said. \"When you're talking about cooking a large piece of meat, a slow cooker is a great place to start.\"\n\nOne of the desserts Laidlaw includes in her book \"Everyday Slow Cooking\" is for gingersnap-brandy cheesecake, which would be perfect as a treat on a cold day or even a holiday dessert.",

    "fullText": "When people ask me when I plan to retire, they usually expect a number: 62, 65, maybe 70.\n\nMy answer tends to stop them in their tracks: Never.\n\nI have no plans to retire, and it's not because I can't afford to retire —nor is it that I'm afraid to slow down.\n\nI have no retirement plans because my life and career didn't truly begin to unfold until my 50s. I feel like I'm finally getting into the swing of things, and I'm excited to see where my career will go next.\n\nLike many women, I followed the traditional playbook for most of my adult life. I built a career, raised two kids, showed up for my family, and did the responsible thing year after year.\n\nFor a long time, my identity revolved around being needed at home, at school, at sports, at work, everywhere.\n\nThen my kids grew up and moved out. The house got quieter. And for the first time in decades, I had space to ask a question I hadn't considered in years: What do I want now?\n\nWhat happened next surprised me. In my 50s, I launched a podcast with over 600,000 downloads. I became a regular television co-host and lifestyle contributor. I started writing for national outlets.\n\nI built a platform centered on women over 50 and the idea that midlife isn't a decline; it's an awakening.\n\nNone of this was part of a carefully mapped plan. It happened because I finally stopped waiting for permission.\n\nI stopped telling myself it was \"too late.\" I stopped assuming the best years were behind me. I stopped shrinking my ambition to fit someone else's idea of what women my age should want.\n\nOne of the biggest myths about aging is that ambition fades. In my experience, it becomes more intentional.\n\nI take more risks now because I trust myself more. I care less about external validation. And I'm far more willing to say yes to things that light me up and no to things that don't.\n\nThat confidence didn't come from youth. It came from experience.\n\nI don't see the next decades as the beginning of an ending. I see them as chapters filled with curiosity, contribution, and creativity.\n\nI want to keep learning. I want to keep creating. I want to keep building meaningful work.\n\nFor many people, retirement is a reward. It's a long-awaited escape from work that drained them. I understand that, but I'm not running from my work. I'm running toward it.\n\nI've intentionally designed a career that excites me, challenges me creatively, and allows me to grow. The work I do now feels aligned in a way it never did in my earlier years — when I was juggling everything and everyone else.\n\nWhy would I want to step away from something that finally feels like mine?\n\nIf my 50s taught me anything, it's that the timeline we're given is outdated.\n\nLife doesn't peak at 30 or 40. Purpose doesn't expire at 50 or 60. Ambition doesn't have an age limit.\n\nI don't know exactly what my work will look like in my 60s, 70s, or 80s, and that excites me.\n\nWhat I do know is this: I'm not done building, I'm not done learning, and I'm certainly not done contributing.",

    "fullText": "Ina Garten is all about making things easy in the kitchen.\n\nSo, after a long and hectic workday, I always gravitate toward a quick Barefoot Contessa recipe.\n\nGarten says this salmon teriyaki and Broccolini dinner is \"so fast and delicious\" that she wants to make it every night.\n\nOne of the first dishes that Garten shared on Instagram during the pandemic was her salmon teriyaki and Broccolini, which she called a \"quick one-bowl dinner.\"\n\nWhen I decided to kick-start my cooking journey by living like the \"Barefoot Contessa\" for a day, Garten's salmon teriyaki and Broccolini recipe was one of the dishes I decided to make. It seemed easy and foolproof, plus it looked absolutely delicious.\n\nTo make the salmon teriyaki sauce, you'll need:\n\nIt may seem like a lot of ingredients, but the sauce took me less than 30 seconds to prep.\n\nI combined the olive oil, soy sauce, maple syrup, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes in a small saucepan and brought everything to a boil over medium heat.\n\nThen, I lowered the heat and let the saucepan simmer for two minutes before setting it aside. Just like that, the sauce was done.\n\nIf you're making this for four people, you'll need four skinless salmon fillets (about 2 to 2 ½ pounds total).\n\nGarten recommends arranging your fish in a baking dish that's \"just large enough to hold them with a little space in between the fillets.\"\n\nPer her recipe, I arranged the salmon fillets with their rounded sides up and sprinkled a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper.\n\nThen, I spooned the teriyaki sauce evenly over the fillets before popping them in the oven on the upper rack at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Garten recommends baking your salmon for 12 to 13 minutes if you prefer it rare, or 13 to 14 minutes for medium, depending on the thickness of the fillets.\n\nIf you're making this for four people, Garten recommends using 1 ½ pounds of Broccolini (with the lower thirds of the stems discarded).\n\nI spread my Broccolini on a sheet pan, generously drizzling them with olive oil and seasoning them with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Next, I tossed the Broccolini with my hands to ensure they were evenly coated, then spread them out in a single layer on the sheet pan.\n\nTen minutes before my salmon was done, I popped my Broccolini on the lower oven rack.\n\nThe bright-orange fillets had turned into a pretty pale-pink hue, and just by looking at them, I had a feeling the fish was going to be super fluffy.\n\nMy salmon was flaky and tender, and I absolutely loved the teriyaki sauce. It gave the fish a delicious and subtle tang without overpowering it. My only complaint was that I wanted more of it!\n\nThe salmon's light, fluffy texture also paired well with the Broccolini, which had a great char. The veggies were crisp yet tender, adding a satisfying crunch to the dish.\n\nGarten's salmon teriyaki and Broccolini is so simple and delicious that it's easy to see why it's become one of her weeknight go-to dinners — now it's one of mine as well.",

    "fullText": "Target once again finds itself in a precarious political balancing act.\n\nThe bullseye retailer's stores have been a flash point during the recent immigration enforcement activity in its hometown of Minneapolis, and the company has remained publicly quiet on the issue.\n\nBut on Thursday, human resources chief Melissa Kremer sent a memo to staff acknowledging \"the stress many of you may be carrying.\" It came as armed federal agents detained thousands of people across the city, and residents protested the moves.\n\nThe company declined to comment on the memo.\n\nSome of those encounters have occurred in Target stores and parking lots.\n\nA spokesperson previously declined to comment when video clips that appeared to show an employee being detained and an in-store bathroom break for Commander Gregory Bovino went viral.\n\n\"Target does not have cooperative agreements with any immigration enforcement agency,\" Kremer said in this week's memo. \"We're listening and working to de-escalate where possible.\"\n\nThe memo also mentioned new internal resources for workers about how to safely handle \"disruption near our locations.\"\n\nWhile Target spoke out publicly following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the company has more recently tried to avoid alienating either side of the political aisle on issues such as LGBTQ+ Pride and diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nIn addition to its corporate headquarters, Target has about 20 stores in the greater Twin Cities metro area and is one of the largest employers in the state.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "My friend wanted to plan a Europe trip, but then I got laid off. We went to Montreal instead, and the more affordable vacation was just what I needed.",
    "fullText": "I'm never one to say no to travel, whether it's for work, to visit a friend, or just because.\n\nIn the first half of last year alone, I flew from New York to Palm Springs with friends, planned a London trip around a play I wanted to see, and saw Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour in Los Angeles.\n\nOne of my friends was trying to sell me on one more big vacation — Scotland, maybe, or Paris — that we could take together before 2025 was over.\n\nIt wouldn't have taken much convincing, but then I got laid off right at the end of May. Suddenly, traveling anywhere felt out of reach.\n\nHowever, as the dust settled and summer came and went, the thought kept creeping back into my mind: Transatlantic travel would definitely have to wait until I had steady work again, but maybe it wouldn't be impossible to take one more small trip while I still had severance?\n\nTurns out, it was possible. We went to Montreal for a long weekend in late October, and it turned out to be the perfect trip.\n\nI'd never been to Montreal before, but it was the perfect destination for several reasons.\n\nLogistically, it was a quick, 90-minute flight from New York, making it an easy choice for a weekend trip. Less time in the air meant we could make the most of just a handful of days on the ground.\n\nI was also able to buy my airfare with credit-card points, which helped keep my out-of-pocket costs low.\n\nPracticalities aside, I knew that Montreal, with its cobblestone streets in the Old Port, cozy cafés, and official language (French), would feel like a true \"trip\" — a chance to hit pause on the stress of the last few months and immerse myself in a new place.\n\nWe kept the itinerary for this girls' weekend loose. Apart from making a few dinner reservations, we really just took our time exploring the city.\n\nAs someone who tends to plan jam-packed vacations, this was definitely a departure for me, but I was surprised to find I didn't really care.\n\nIt certainly didn't feel like I was missing anything as we took our time yapping, poking through vintage stores, and taste-testing Montreal-style bagels.\n\nSure, we made time to hike up Mount Royal and checked out the Old Port, but this trip wound up being less about sightseeing and more about just having a good time together. Getting to close my laptop and not think (too much) about work was the biggest gift of all.\n\nInstead, I got to channel my energy into a few days of uninterrupted time focusing on things that brought me joy: spending quality time with a friend I'd never traveled with before, taking in a new-to-me city, people-watching on public transportation, and successfully ordering my daily oat latte in French.\n\nThe past few months had been unsteady and stressful, and I knew those same uncertainties would be waiting for me when the plane touched down. Still, our trip recharged my batteries in a way I didn't know I needed until we got home.\n\nTaking any sort of trip is a privilege, especially when your life is in flux. Those three days, though, wound up being the perfect trip for this moment in my life.\n\nBest of all, there was enough I didn't do or see in Montreal that I'm already excited to visit again, if given the chance.\n\nI know I'll take another European vacation at some point, once things feel a little more settled. In the meantime, while I wait for the next chance to grab my passport and get on a plane, I'll just sit here with my \"Bon Matin\" mug and be glad I took the trip.",

    "title": "7 mistakes you should never make during a job interview, according to a business-etiquette expert",
    "description": "The etiquette expert advises against leaving your camera off during virtual interviews, dressing too casually, and using filler words or slang.",
    "fullText": "For many, job interviews can be a nerve-racking experience. Even with proper preparation, it's common to struggle with this important step in the hiring process.\n\nTo help you avoid common mistakes, Business Insider asked business-etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore about the things candidates should avoid doing during an interview. Here's what she said.\n\nWhitmore told BI that a simple but common mistake candidates make is arriving to the interview unprepared.\n\n\"Most people don't do the proper research about the company. We have so many resources to use, including LinkedIn, websites, and social media,\" she said. \"There's no excuse for you to go into an interview and not know about the company and something about who might be interviewing you.\"\n\nWhitmore also said it's important to ask the interviewer questions tailored specifically to the company.\n\nAccording to Whitmore, dressing too casually is another common mistake she sees interviewees make.\n\n\"Very rarely do we see someone overdressed for a job interview,\" she said. \"They oftentimes don't put a lot of thought into the details, like the color of their belt or that their shoes are matching their outfit.\"\n\nWhitmore told BI that even when candidates do wear office-friendly attire, they may overlook other key details, like forgetting to cut off the tags or not cutting open the vents in the back.\n\n\"Why would an employer want to hire someone who doesn't pay attention to the details?\" Whitmore asked.\n\nBefore stepping into a job interview, it's important to consider how you're presenting yourself online, especially since Whitmore said the first thing an employer will likely do is Google you.\n\n\"They'll look at all your social media pages. They'll look at what you eat, what you drink, what you wear, who you hang out with, what your lifestyle is — and they make judgments,\" she told BI.\n\nFor that reason, Whitmore suggested adjusting your privacy settings and cleaning up your social media presence to eliminate anything that could be used against you.\n\nWhen in a job interview, Whitmore told BI that candidates should never use inappropriate language, such as profanity, slang, or terminology the employer might not understand.\n\nShe also said to be cautious of filler words and phrases such as \"like\" or \"um\" to avoid muddling the conversation.\n\nWhitmore suggested recording yourself before the interview or practicing ahead of time to ensure you're speaking clearly and precisely.\n\nOne mistake to avoid in virtual interviews is refusing to turn your camera on.\n\nCandidates may choose to keep their cameras off for a number of reasons, such as being worried about making eye contact or feeling uncomfortable with face-to-face interaction. However, Whitmore said keeping the camera on is a good idea so the employer can see your facial expressions.\n\nShe added that candidates should be wary of what their background looks like and make sure their room appears tidy.\n\n\"If you just have to have a blank wall, that's better than a huge distraction. But I definitely recommend that you put a little thought into your background,\" she said.\n\n\"Showing up late for an interview is a huge no-no,\" Whitmore said. \"I've always said when you're on time, you're still late. You should show up early.\"\n\nArriving early ensures you have enough time to find parking or the meeting room. Whitmore added that doing so also allows you to use the restroom and gain your composure before the interview starts.\n\nSending a thank you note is an important step in the interview process.\n\n\"I go overboard. I send a thank you email and a thank you note because this is an opportunity for you to get into the employer's eyes at least twice,\" Whitmore told BI.\n\nBe sure to follow up within 24 hours of the interview and personalize the note.\n\n\"Address the person by name. Tell them why you enjoyed the interview and why you would be a good candidate,\" Whitmore said.\n\nIf you're feeling stuck, she suggested writing out a note and using an AI tool like ChatGPT to polish it.\n\nThis story was originally published on January 14, 2025, and most recently updated on January 23, 2026.",

    "fullText": "Things are looking up for a small Italian eyewear company after French President Emmanuel Macron sported its shades at the World Economic Forum this week.\n\nShares of iVision Tech (IVN), which has a market cap of around €20 million ($23.5 million), are up 65% this week, with much of that gain coming on Friday after photos of Macron began circulating showing him sporting the stylish shades.\n\nThroughout the highly-publicized event in Davos, Switzerland this week, Macron wore a pair of glasses from Maison Henry Jullien, a French company owned by iVision Tech. The latter is based in Milan and listed on the Milan Stock Exchange.\n\nMacron has been wearing glasses since January 15 due to a broken blood vessel in his eye, which makes his eye appear red. The 48-year-old French leader said the optical problem is \"totally benign.\"\n\nThe glasses — Maison Henry Jullien's Pacific S 01 model — aren't cheap. The company's site lists them at €659 ($774). Still, interest in the glasses is soaring. The firm said it had to set up a temporary webpage for the Macron-preferred model due to heavy traffic.\n\n\"Following the significant visibility of the Pacific by Henry Jullien model, worn by President Emmanuel Macron at the Davos Forum, our eShop website is experiencing an exceptional volume of visits and enquiries,\" a message on the Pacific S 01 model's webpage reads. \"To ensure stable and secure access for everyone, we have enabled this official temporary page dedicated to purchasing the model.\"\n\nSpeaking with Reuters, iVision Tech CEO Stefano Fulchir said Macron's high-profile appearance in the glasses \"certainly created ‌a wow effect on the stock.\"\n\nMacron wore the glasses during a panel with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, in a solo speech, and around the Swiss town during the week.\n\nIt's unclear what caused Macron's eye condition. In his more than hourlong speech in Davos, President Donald Trump himself wondered aloud about it.\n\n\"I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses,\" Trump said. \"What the hell happened?\"",

    "title": "Yes, You Can Really Have a Heart Attack From Shoveling Snow",
    "description": "Some people are more at risk than others—here's what you should know.",
    "fullText": "You may have heard of people—elderly folks in particular—getting a heart attack from shoveling snow. This is a real risk for a lot of people, especially if you are sedentary and have certain health conditions. Here's a breakdown of what’s so dangerous about shoveling, and who's most at risk.\n\nThe connection between shoveling and cardiac events is real: The American Heart Association cites several studies that found higher rates of heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths after snowstorms. Shoveling is hard work, and it can cause your blood pressure and heart rate to rise far higher than levels that are considered safe for sedentary people with heart conditions. Cold temperatures also seem to make chest pain more likely, possibly because your arteries can constrict in the cold.\n\nYou may have heard the advice to check with a doctor before beginning an exercise program. I have more information on that here: Most people don’t need to check with a doctor, but that depends on your medical history and on whether you intend to do intense exercise.\n\nSince snow shoveling is intense exercise, it’s worth taking a look at those guidelines. If you have cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or kidney disease, and are currently not exercising intensely, you should check with a doctor before you start. That’s true whether the intense exercise you want to do is running, Crossfit, or shoveling six inches of snow from your driveway.\n\nOne surprising thing: The cautions around shoveling snow also apply to using a snowblower. Snowblowing turns out to also be serious exercise, even if, in theory, it should be easier because a machine is doing part of the work.\n\nIn a news release from the American Heart Association, the cardiologist who was the lead author on a paper on risks of exercise recommends that certain people should not do their own shoveling. This includes:\n\nPeople who have had bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty\n\nPeople who have already had a heart attack or stroke\n\nPeople who have diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol\n\nObviously, advice from an internet article is not the same as medical advice from your doctor, so please defer to actual medical expertise. And if you’re healthy enough that shoveling snow is reasonably safe, you may still want to take a few precautions to make shoveling easier on your body. By the way, even though running a snowblower is hard work, it’s still usually easier on your body than shoveling. And if you need to shovel, pushing a shovel is easier on your body than lifting it repeatedly.\n\nI would add that it’s a game changer to shovel multiple times in a single snowstorm. Instead of waiting until you have six inches of snow on the ground, go out when there’s just two inches and it’ll be a breeze. Repeat that process two more times, and you’ll have a clear driveway without ever having to wrestle with ankle-deep snow.\n\nFinally, be aware of how your body is feeling as you shovel, and stop if you don’t feel well. Or as the AHA put it: \"If you experience chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness or heart palpitations or irregular heart rhythms stop the activity immediately. Call 9-1-1 if symptoms don’t subside shortly after snow removal.\"",

    "description": "When does a badass winter run actually become unsafe?",
    "fullText": "Dedicated runners and winter athletes will tell you that exercising in the cold is not as tough as it looks. Personally, I'd rather risk frostbite over any treadmill run that lasts longer than 20 minutes. But is there a point where winter runs cross over from difficult to dangerous?\n\nMost experts suggest that the danger zone begins around -18°F (-28° Celcius), particularly when factoring in wind chill. At these extreme temperatures, the risk of frostbite increases dramatically, and breathing frigid air can become uncomfortable or even harmful to your lungs and airways.\n\nBut beyond the raw temperature, certain conditions should prompt you to choose the treadmill over the trail. Wind chill matters significantly more than the actual temperature—a 20°F day with 25 mph winds feels like -4°F and carries similar risks. Precipitation combined with cold is particularly dangerous, as wet clothing rapidly accelerates heat loss.\n\nIcy conditions create obvious fall risks, and a twisted ankle or other injury becomes far more serious when you're miles from home in subzero temperatures. If the footing is treacherous with ice or you're unable to adequately protect your extremities with the gear you have available, it's wise to skip the outdoor run. Trust your instincts: If the cold feels genuinely painful within the first few minutes rather than just uncomfortable, that's your body sending a clear message.\n\nAgain, this threshold isn't absolute. Your personal cold tolerance, experience level, the gear you own, and specific weather conditions all play a role. I know I've managed runs in 10°F, mostly because it was plenty sunny, with no wind, and I was expertly bundled up. Here are some of things to do if you’re a brave soul heading out to run in the freezing cold.\n\nIf you do venture out in very cold weather, preparation is everything. Dress in layers using moisture-wicking base layers, insulating middle layers, and windproof outer shells. Protect your extremities carefully with gloves or mittens, a hat or headband, and warm socks. A neck gaiter is a must-have to pull up over your nose and mouth to help warm the air before it reaches the lungs.\n\nStart your run into the wind so you'll have it at your back when you're sweaty and more vulnerable to heat loss on the return trip. Keep your runs shorter and stay close to home or in areas with bailout options. Let someone know your route and expected return time. It also helps to physically modify your route to accommodate layers. Plan a run where you can shed extra layers after the first mile and then pick them up on your way back.\n\nPay attention to your body throughout the run. Any numbness, excessive pain, confusion, or severe shivering means it's time to get indoors immediately. Remember that you can always cut a run short—there's no shame in prioritizing your safety over a workout.\n\nAnother tip, from plenty of personal experience: Be extra aware of mouth-breathing while running in cold, dry air. I recommend running with cough drops in order to help you practice breathing through your nose.\n\nI always tell myself that if something feels off after my first mile, I’m allowed to turn around and walk home. Grant yourself extra leniency in extreme weather conditions. If you really can’t bear missing any miles, consider a hybrid plan of running half of your route outdoors and half on a treadmill.\n\nYou can run outside at quite chilly temperatures before you seriously risk frostbite or any other cold-weather consequences. For most runners, the practical limit for safe outdoor running falls somewhere between 0 and -20°F. As long as you’re prepared with protective gear, you can listen to your body to acclimate to cold temperatures as best as you personally can.",

    "title": "How to Shovel Snow Without Hurting Your Back",
    "description": "Shovel early and often, push instead of lift, and more ways to survive the next big snowstorm.",
    "fullText": "When nature dumps a load of snow onto your driveway, it’s a free workout in disguise—but maybe not one you’re really in shape to tackle. If you’re always sore (or, worse, injured) after the first big storm of the season, read these tips on how to make shoveling easier on your body.\n\nLook, just because shoveling is a common chore doesn’t mean it’s one that everyone’s body is automatically ready for. Be honest about whether you’re trained for this. You wouldn’t ask “how can I run a marathon without my legs being sore the next day?” if you haven’t done any running at all in the past year. Jumping into something you’re not ready for is going to suck.\n\nIf you know you’ll be shoveling a lot, plan ahead. Deadlifts in the gym will help you build the strength you need in your back, core, and legs, for example. If you’re not up for that, any full body fitness regime will leave you better prepared than doing nothing.\n\nAnd while we’re mostly talking about sore muscles and aching joints, it’s important to recognize whether your cardiovascular system is up to the task. If you aren’t used to exercising, and if you are older or have a heart condition, you may want to check with your doctor about whether shoveling poses a risk to your heart.\n\nIf I could give the world only one snow-shoveling hack, it is this: Shovel when there is only a small amount of snow, even if you know there’s more coming. It’s far, far easier on your body to shovel three inches of snow four times over the course of the day, than to tackle 12 inches of snow all at once.\n\nIf you missed your opportunity, you can still shovel in layers. Take a slice off the top, then a slice that goes deeper, and so on. Each shovelful will be much lighter and easier to deal with, even though you are taking more shovelfuls in total.\n\nWe tend to envision shoveling as a repetitive bend-and-lift movement, but don’t forget that you can also use your shovel as a snowplow to push the snow in front of you. You can even buy shovels that are meant to be used this way, so consider an upgrade.\n\nPushing the snow works best when it’s in a thin layer, so this works well with the advice to shovel when there’s only a small amount on the ground. But even if you have deep snow, pushing can save you some effort. Push until you have a pile, and then slice off the pile in layers.\n\nYou’ve heard the advice to lift heavy boxes “with your legs, not your back.” What this really means is that your back is best protected from injury when you can keep it straight. If your back rounds as it gets tired, take a break, or find a technique that allows you to keep your back straight even while it’s tired.\n\nFor example, it’s most efficient to shovel in a deadlift-like motion: Your back is more or less straight, and you’re hingeing from your hips like a drinky bird. This does require a lot of work from your lower back muscles, so you are technically lifting “with your back,” but it’s safe as long as your back muscles are strong enough to keep your torso straight and stable.\n\nAs your back muscles get tired, you may find it easier to keep your back straight if you keep it more upright. This is where a squat motion comes in—the proverbial lifting “with your legs.” Choke up on the shovel so the weight is as close to your body as possible, and bend your knees more so that you don’t have to bend as much from the hips.\n\nDon’t kid yourself: This is a workout. And as with any workout, the first 10 to 15 minutes will feel the hardest. So keep the work light at first—take smaller shovelfuls, for example. Don’t forget to take breaks, either. You’re not cheating if you stop for a few minutes to let your body rest before getting back into it.\n\nSwitching techniques (as above) and positions can help to distribute the strain across your body rather than just hammering the same muscles over and over. Do half your shoveling with the shovel on your right side, and half with the shovel to your left.",

    "title": "What to Do to Prepare Your House for This Weekend's Historic Winter Storm",
    "description": "You still have time to get ready for the potentially hazardous weather.",
    "fullText": "Ideally, a winter storm is merely uncomfortable and annoying, but they can sometimes be dangerous for you and your home. This weekend, a potentially historic winter storm is bearing down on some 200 million Americans, who may face dangerously icy conditions and significant snowfall. It's important to know your area's risk and understand the meaning and potential impact of different weather terms (advisory, watch, and warning) so you can respond quickly in the event of an emergency. You should also use the next few days to take steps to prepare your home and lower the chances of damage and danger.\n\nWinter prep starts with a thorough inspection of your property, both inside and out and top to bottom. Look for everything from roof leaks to door gaps to clogged gutters—anything that could lead to damage from snow, ice, and freezing temperatures. Make a plan for repairs and winterization to ensure your safety and comfort—not just for the next storm, but for the entire season.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the most important tasks to take care of before the temperatures drop or the snow starts to fall.\n\nThis is something that should be part of your regular home maintenance, and it's especially important when you are using your furnace and fireplace regularly (considering both fire safety and indoor air quality). Follow the Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines for where to install CO detectors and how to inspect and maintain them; then check out the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) guidelines for smoke alarms. Make sure your fire extinguisher is handy and working as well.\n\nAny thermostat will show you indoor temperature, and if you have a smart system like an Ecobee or Nest, you have real-time data at your fingertips. The CDC also recommends installing easy-to-read thermometers in locations where you'll see them frequently. This is especially important for older adults, as our sense of temperature changes as we age, increasing the risk of cold-related health issues.\n\nGaps around doors and windows keep your home drafty, which is uncomfortable and a waste of energy. Door sweeps, weatherstripping, and caulk can be used to fill spaces that allow cold air in. These are simple DIY fixes that go a long way toward lowering your heating bill and keeping your home warm. If your home has older windows, floor-to-ceiling thermal curtains can also help with insulation even if you lose heating.\n\nBefore freezing temperatures arrive, make sure your outdoor plumbing is prepared—frozen pipes can burst, causing significant damage to your home. To winterize exterior faucets, remove and store hoses, shut off outdoor water, drain spigots, close them up, and insulate with covers.\n\nWhile you don't need to fully winterize your indoor plumbing unless your house will be vacant for an extended period of time, you should look for pipes that are uninsulated and in or near unheated spaces and consider applying insulation sleeves or heat tape.\n\nTurn your furnace on and make sure it is working properly. Even if you don't need to heat your home right now, you don't want to scramble to schedule an emergency repair down the line when it's freezing outside. Look for common signs that your unit needs maintenance, such as unusual smells and noises, short cycling, and lack of actual heat. Replace your air filter as well.\n\nYour fireplace or wood stove can provide heat in an emergency. Like your furnace, they need seasonal maintenance to avoid chemical buildup and ensure proper venting, both of which impact your indoor air quality and overall safety. The NFPA recommends annual cleaning, which you can do yourself. However, if it's been awhile since your fireplace was professionally inspected and cleaned, consider scheduling a chimney sweep before you start your first winter fire. You can find one online or ask your local fire department for a recommendation.\n\nIf you get snow in your area, make sure your shovels are accessible and restock your ice melt. If you use a snowblower, give it a thorough inspection, replace any worn or damaged parts, change the oil, top it off with fresh gas, and start it up to make sure it runs.\n\nYou should be prepared for storms during any season with a stock of disaster supplies so you and your family (and pets) can survive without outside aid for a few days if needed. We have a guide to creating an emergency kit if you don't have one already, but you should also check all supplies and replenish anything that has been used or is missing. For winter, be sure you also have sleeping bags, warm blankets, and climate-appropriate changes of clothes and shoes available.",

I said I will give my best for a great season and Steve and me are still 100% committed.\"\n\nGlasner, who guided the Eagles to their first major trophy when they beat Manchester City to win the FA Cup last season, also said he \"does not regret\" his comments after the Sunderland game.\n\n\"Do I think it was the best way? No I don't think so, but that's Oliver Glasner. I've always told you that's Oliver Glasner,\" he added.\n\n\"I don't say I'm perfect, I would like to be. I never attacked anyone personally, I just explained my feelings.\"\n\nGlasner also clarified that French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta will be available for Palace's home game against Chelsea despite reports he is set to leave the club during the transfer window.\n\n\"No bid has come in and he hasn't handed in a transfer request and he will play Sunday. That's the situation,\" he explained.\n\n\"I'll repeat what I said two weeks ago - [for] every player there is a price where a club say OK. Evaluating the whole situation - age, contract duration and a price where the club says, 'OK we agree a deal'.\"",

We have always had a good relationship and it's really nice to be reunited.\"\n\nGuarino said: \"I'm delighted to be working with Katie again. Her ability to dictate play from the centre of the pitch, as well as her set-piece expertise are strengths to her game that will be real assets for us.\n\n\"She also knows what it takes to compete at the highest level which will add huge value to this group of players.\"\n\nZelem could make her West Ham debut against Leicester City on Sunday, 25 January (11:55 GMT).",

    "fullText": "England defender Jess Carter says she did not want to leave her hotel room after receiving racist messages online during Euro 2025 for fear of encountering her abusers.\n\nEarlier this month, Nigel Dewale, 60, pleaded guilty to sending abusive posts to 28-year-old Carter's TikTok account during the tournament, which defending champions England went on to win.\n\nThe messages included a derogatory reference to Carter's race and suggested people with brown skin were \"murderers\" and \"groomers\".\n\nThe former Birmingham City and Chelsea centre-back also said she feels the abuse female players are dealing with \"is getting worse\".\n\nCarter, who now plays for Gotham FC in the National Women's Soccer League in the United States, said at the time she had to take a step back from social media because she had experienced \"a lot of racial abuse\" from the start of the tournament.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave the hotel in case those people who were saying those things where going to be in Switzerland with us,\" Carter told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It was quite a scary time. It totally devalues you as a human being.\"",

    "fullText": "Isaan Khan reports for the Daily Mail that Arsenal have concerns over Kai Havertz’s long-term fitness after another recent flare-up of his knee injury.\n\nHavertz initially injured his knee back at the start of the season in August, and just when he was on the verge of a comeback he suffered a setback to the same knee in November.\n\nKhan claims Havertz’s knee then reacted again to his recent injury comeback, hence the decision to manage his workload by leaving him out for a couple of games earlier this month.\n\nThere are fears that if the knee continues to flare up it could have a long-term impact on Havertz’s fitness, so the club are acting very cautiously with the forward.\n\nThat being said, the report adds that Havertz is expected to be given further minutes in the coming days and weeks. Those minutes will then be used to assess whether the 26-year-old can be consistently available for starts over the remainder of the campaign.\n\nIt’s certainly a worrying update, and it goes some way to explaining why Havertz has only played 29 minutes across Arsenal’s last seven games since he first made it back into the squad.\n\nPerhaps next week’s game against Kairat Almaty could provide an opportunity for a lower-stakes test, given Arsenal only need a home draw against the Champions League’s bottom-ranked club to secure first place in the League Phase.\n\nEven a defeat and a goal difference swing to leave Arsenal in second place wouldn’t matter for any reason other than the finances involved. In sporting terms, finishing first or second makes no difference, as you will be randomly drawn against one of the same two teams either way.\n\nConsidering the rest of Arsenal’s fixture list largely contains vital Premier League matches, League Cup semi-finals, and so on, there won’t be many better chances to properly reintroduce Havertz.",

He is not the only arrival anticipated. Ethan Nwaneri’s move on loan from Arsenal is also expected to be officialised in the coming hours. There will be no buy option included in that deal.\n\nIt is thought that Timber’s arrival at the Vélodrome will put an end to Angel Gomes’ spell at OM.

    "fullText": "In an interview with D.J. Siddiqi of The Escapist, Henry said he hasn't even thought about retirement, adding, “I’m motivated more than ever. I really appreciated this year and how it all went down, because it motivated me to be ready to get back next year and work as hard as I can in the offseason to be better. I don’t have a timeline. I’m just ready to go.”\n\nHenry finished the 2025 season second in the NFL in rushing with 1,595 yards and 16 touchdowns. He also averaged 5.2 yards per carry, which was higher than his career average of 4.9.\n\nLongevity has been the separator for Henry, the NFL's active leader in rushing attempts, which he credits to strict attention to diet, training, and recovery. While the Ravens fell short of the playoffs at 8–9 after a slow, injury-filled start, Henry emphasized that small mistakes often decide games, stressing the importance of execution and complementary football.\n\nRather than looking ahead to retirement, Henry remains focused on improving this offseason and helping Baltimore take the next step in 2026.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ravens Wire: Derrick Henry 2026: Ravens Running Back Has No Retirement Plans",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s transfer plans for the summer are starting to become clear, and they may soon need to replace the departing defender.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite is being considered as a potential replacement for Harry Maguire, with the current club captain’s contract set to expire in June.\n\nDavid Ornstein has told fans of the club that it could be a busy summer in terms of recruitment, with multiple signings expected across various positions.\n\nThe midfield appears to be a top priority, with reports indicating that at least two high-profile additions could be on the way. Casemiro’s departure has only increased the need for changes in that area.\n\nThe defence may also require attention, especially with Harry Maguire’s contract running down. One promising option has already been mentioned as a possible target.\n\nIf Maguire does leave, United would be one defender short in a season where European football and a deeper cup run are both on the cards.\n\nGiven Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt’s injury history, it’s no surprise the club is exploring defensive options, and Jacobo Ramon from Como has come into the frame.\n\nJournalist Ben Jacobs has said that Ramon is a player United are keeping an eye on, especially if Maguire heads out.\n\n“If Maguire goes, of course, Manchester United might be in the market for another young centre back, particularly a left-sided centre back, but much of these centre backs now are just as comfortable on the left or on the right.\n\n“Like Tottenham and Chelsea, Jacobo Ramon is one name they quite like. He’s capable of playing on the right and on the left as well. But I think Real Madrid might utilise their buyback clause in the summer and pry him away from Como”\n\nThis season under Cesc Fabregas – who has been mentioned as a possible managerial option for United – Ramon has become an important figure at Como.\n\nMaguire has always been known for his dominance in the air, both defensively and going forward. Any replacement would need to bring a similar presence.\n\nRamon fits that profile, winning 3.2 aerial duels per game in Serie A this season – a number Maguire hasn’t reached since 2020/21.\n\nComo are moving up the table, and Ramon is a big reason why. He won’t come cheap, but given his overall ability on both sides of the ball, it seems like an obvious move for any top club.\n\nAt just 21 years old, Ramon is already one of Europe’s most well-rounded young centre-backs. Even with Real Madrid’s likely interest, Ineos should be doing everything they can to get involved in the conversation.",

    "fullText": "Clubs in the top two tiers of English women’s football are set to be able to offer contracts to 16-year-old academy players as part of new proposals from the leagues’ organisers.\n\nThe academy contracts are designed specifically to allow the women’s game a mechanism to contract a young high-potential player but also allow flexibility so they can still access state-funded education. Alternatively clubs may also choose to offer an academy contract alongside an apprenticeship, similar to the men’s game.\n\nEvery Women’s Super League and WSL 2 club is set to offer the same pay per age group so the right protections are in place for players. An Arsenal girls’ player on an academy contract is due to receive the same as a Sunderland girls’ player in WSL 2, for example. The proposed standardised rate of pay bands are also aligned with their male counterparts.\n\nWSL Football, the independent body overseeing the top two tiers of the women’s game, is still going through the governance process to finalise the framework and is working through details such as transfer fees.\n\nUnlike in men’s football, currently women’s teams cannot offer a contract to 16-year-old players. Most players sign their first professional contract at the age of 18.\n\nIn 2023, however, Chelsea midfielder Lexi Potter was the first women’s player in England to sign a professional deal at the age of 17.\n\nAn academy contract differs from full-time professional contracts in many areas; the number of contracted hours and pay are just two examples.\n\nAn academy contract can be offered in the player’s under 16 season, at the age of 15 or 16, but it would not start until their under 17 season, at the age of 16 or 17 years old. Not every player will necessarily go on an academy contract.\n\nA recognition payment framework — when clubs receive a fee in recognition of the training and development of one of their academy players if they are signed by another club — was introduced ahead of the 2023-24 season.\n\nOn the one hand it provides more clarity for clubs and players and long-term sustainability for the academy pathway.\n\nIt also offers clubs more protection as currently players can move to another team on a seven-day approach. Such assurances should encourage more investment into the pathway. However, there is some concern such protection favours the bigger clubs who tend to stockpile the best young talent and the onus to spend more money will be felt, particularly among WSL2 clubs.\n\nOn the other hand, being selected at a younger age can put more pressure on players and may lead to inflated player values. Given decisions can be taken earlier, players who develop at an older age may also be impacted.\n\nIt also could pose the risk of players dropping out earlier in the pathway if they do not receive an academy contract at the first possible stage. The balance of prioritising football and education is key.\n\n“We’ve been working for a number of years on what is the right regulatory framework for the girls’ and women’s game,” said a WSL spokesperson. “The clubs are aware and in favour of them. We want to put the player at the heart of these decisions and for them to make their own choices on their education pathway.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "With only a few weeks left of NFL games until August, it’s time to take a look ahead to the teams that underachieved this season but are set up to take big steps forward next season. These five teams are all more talented than their records this past season indicated, and here is why they will all bounce back and improve next season.\n\nThe Giants have some big names on their defensive front and also have one of the league’s most exciting young quarterbacks in Jaxson Dart. When you add a brand new Super Bowl-winning head coach to the mix in John Harbaugh, things immediately improve.\n\nThe Giants future success goes way beyond that, though. The return of Malik Nabers will have a massive impact on this offense, as will the return of running back Cam Skateboo. The Giants should also be able to improve in the draft and via free agency, setting them up for what should be a much better 2026/2027 season.\n\nIf not for Joe Burrow missing most of the season, the Bengals could have easily won the weak AFC North division. Burrow is arguably a top-three quarterback in the NFL, and when he did suit up this season, the Bengals offense was one of the best in the league.\n\nExpect them to make improvements to their defense through the draft and be a much more competitive team next season. One thing they will need to address as well is their offensive line, so that they can protect Joe Burrow better and keep him healthy.\n\nThe Falcons were exciting early on this season, and they played great football to end the season as well. They have a very exciting offense that is loaded with star players, and the return of Michael Penix Jr. should only improve their chances.\n\nThey hired Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach, who should be a great fit for them, and also give Stefanski a chance to prove what he can do with a talented offense, something he was never given in Cleveland. The Falcons defense was much improved last season and should only continue to improve heading into next season.\n\nThe Vikings got off to a horrible start this season and dug themselves such a deep hole that they couldn’t climb out of. Based on how well they finished the season, though, there is hope that they can get back to being a playoff team in the NFC next season.\n\nThey have a very talented defense, one of the best offensive minds at head coach, and one of the best wide receivers in the league as well. Keeping JJ McCarthy healthy will be very important, but the Vikings could also look to bring in a veteran quarterback to not only push McCarthy but also as insurance in the event that McCarthy gets hurt again or just doesn’t perform well enough.\n\nThe Ravens entered this season as one of the Super Bowl favorites and ended up being the most disappointing team in the league. Lamar Jackson couldn’t stay healthy, the defense struggled for most of the season, and the wide receiving corps underwhelmed.\n\nThey moved on from John Harbaugh this offseason and hired Jesse Minter, who was one of the hottest names on the market. Bringing in a great offensive coordinator to work with the multiple-time MVP award winner, Lamar Jackson, is the team’s next mission. Keeping Jackson healthy, adding another big WR weapon, and getting some fresh blood on the sidelines coaching should lead to a much more successful 2026/2027 season.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post 5 NFL teams who will take a big step forward next season  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Mass demonstrations can be worthwhile. But they also may be substituting for more useful forms of political participation.",
    "fullText": "Siddhu Pachipala is a student at MIT.\n\nOn the last day of a seminar I took at Harvard called The Success and Failure of Protest Movements, the professor circled the room with a final question: Should we protest?\n\nIn a class of roughly 50 students, every hand shot up almost instantly. My classmates argued that when the Trump administration pushes constitutional boundaries, resistance — marching, chanting, “speaking truth to power” — is what good citizenship looks like. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s name came up more than once, shorthand for the moral clarity of the moment. The instinctive speed and unanimity of the reaction left me uneasy.\n\nProtest has become the reflexive form of political participation on college campuses in recent years. Having led some chants and carried a few signs myself, I know the thrill: of standing against the Establishment, of being too loud and too numerous to ignore, of politics at its most immediate and emotionally legible. So my discomfort in class was not founded in an objection to protest as such. It came from a growing awareness that our peculiar understanding of protest on campus has made it both less effective and more likely to crowd out other forms of political participation that may be better suited for our moment.\n\nConsider the most prominent protest movements of past decades — Occupy Wall Street, March for Our Lives, Black Lives Matter, the wave of campus protests over Gaza — and a pattern emerges: extraordinary attention paired with limited legislative returns. Judge these protests’ precise aims however you’d like, but note that their scale, often in the millions, did not reliably cash out politically.\n\nDefenders of protest respond by broadening the definition of success. My classmates emphasized protest’s expressive value, how it affirms dignity, agency, and moral identity. Protests succeed, in this telling, not necessarily by changing policy but by helping people find their voices.\n\nIt is perfectly understandable to want to protest in the face of injustice; we bear a constitutional right to peaceable assembly for a reason. The expressive experience of a protest is an important form of solidarity; it can channel our spirited indignation in a way that isn’t revolutionary but reformist; and, even if it does not persuade, it can at least raise the salience of an issue for decision makers and the public.\n\nBut expression is not, in itself, a political achievement. Politics turns on assembling large and lasting majorities capable of exercising power. So protest earns its keep not when it feels morally bracing inside but when it builds those majorities and translates urgency into change outside. We must maintain a careful distinction between what feels powerful and what actually is powerful, especially because protest has a way of being so emotionally captivating that marching in a demonstration can make us feel like we’ve been excellent citizens — that we’ve fulfilled our “civic engagement” quota — when we haven’t done the thing we intended.\n\nKing understood this distinction. His uncommon genius was to subject his movement’s righteous anger to the strategic discipline democratic politics demands: message control, organizational hierarchy, tactical self-restraint. King sidelined factions that could threaten legitimacy or alienate an uncommitted middle. Protest was never the end goal of the civil rights movement. It was one tool among many, subordinated to the larger project of persuading the country.\n\nCampus protest culture forgets that lesson. It is allergic to structure; leadership and strategy are signs of inauthenticity. Any effort to persuade skeptics is unacceptable “both-sides-ism,” and any pitch to distance from radical elements is disloyalty. Expression becomes the goal rather than the means.\n\nThe problem, though, is more than tactical. Protest depends on civic conditions it cannot generate on its own. A protest that successfully persuades presupposes a political culture in which opponents recognize one another as legitimate participants — that those people marching over there are not unlike me, that they may be owed a hearing. This assumption is increasingly untenable. More and more, Americans don’t just see their ideological opponents as mistaken; the other side is assumed to be dangerously corrupt or acting in bad faith. Under these conditions, it is unclear who, exactly, contemporary campus protests are meant to persuade. Donald Trump and his followers are unlikely to be moved because students in Cambridge disapprove of his administration.\n\nIf protest is to matter, the civic foundations that make persuasion possible have to be rebuilt. That means that at least for now, we must devote less energy to expression directed at distant national actors and more to the slower, less glamorous work of conversation closer to home, which is far more likely to change how people actually vote and govern. Protest and conversation are, of course, not mutually exclusive; my ask is that we remember what each can actually achieve.\n\nI know how daunting this can seem. I grew up in a county in Texas that votes Republican by 15 points. Politics there looks nothing like it does on campus. But I also see how quickly caricatures dissolve and people open up when disagreement moves to conversation in church basements and around kitchen tables. It is difficult to hate someone once you are forced to take their reasons seriously and to defend your own in return.\n\nThat kind of engagement is, in a way, more demanding than protest. Protest is not dialectical; it draws on and inflames our passions, but it does not require confronting the strongest version of an opposing argument with our reason like conversation does. Protest may exercise some liberal virtues — a sensitivity to suffering, the courage to stand in public on behalf of some conception of the common good — but those virtues are woefully incomplete without those developed in conversation: the practical wisdom in weighing tradeoffs, the self-command in listening rather than dominating.\n\nThat protest is the default civic posture on campus reflects how young people understand disagreement at a more fundamental level. If political opponents are not just wrong but unreasonable, if conversation is ultimately futile, then it is prudent for politics to become a series of mass displays meant to overwhelm and little else. Yet democracy can only survive on the belief that our opponents are not so alien from us and that persuasion, however difficult, remains possible.\n\nYoung liberals, in particular, should be cautious. Trump’s rise was fueled in part by the perception that liberal elites advanced unpopular policy agendas without seriously considering dissenting arguments. Because liberals protest more than any other political group, every additional protest that isn’t accompanied by rational conversation just endorses the image: We are the rowdy, unthinking kids uninterested in genuine engagement, more than happy to take refuge in numbers.\n\nTo be sure, I am not opposed to protest on principle. There are moments when politics rightly looks like mass mobilization. But there are also moments when our impulse to protest becomes a substitute for good citizenship rather than its highest expression. This is one of those moments. Our civic fabric is frayed. It will not be repaired by larger crowds or sharper slogans alone. It will be repaired, if it is, by conversation, work that may be harder for us than marching — but work whose consequence could last.",

    "fullText": "The hidden threat eating away at museum treasures\n\nExtremophile molds are invading art museums and devouring their collections. Stigma and climate change have fueled their spread\n\nLast summer I polled the great art houses of Europe with a seemingly straightforward question: Had they had any recent experiences with mold in their collections?\n\nMold is a perennial scourge in museums that can disfigure and destroy art and artifacts. To keep this microbial foe in check, institutions follow protocols designed to deter the familiar fungi that thrive in humid settings. But it seems a new front has opened in this long-standing battle. I’d recently heard rumblings that curators in my then home base of Denmark have been wrestling with perplexing infestations that seem to defy the normal rules of engagement. I wondered how pervasive the problem might be.\n\nMy survey did not make me popular. Some museums responded quickly—too quickly, perhaps, to have checked with their curators. Ten minutes after receiving my inquiry, the press office at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence assured me unequivocally that there was no mold at the Uffizi. The museum declined to connect me with the curatorial team or restoration department. Many institutions—the Louvre, the British Museum, the Musée d’Orsay—didn’t respond to my calls and e-mails at all. I eventually came to suspect the Vatican Museum had blocked my number.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nFrustrating though it was, this is the reception I expected. Asking a curator if their museum has problems with mold is like asking if they have a sexually transmitted disease. It’s contagious, it’s taboo, and it carries the inevitable implication someone has done something naughty.\n\nConsequently, mold is spoken of in whispers in the museum world. Curators fear that even rumors of an infestation can hurt their institution’s funding and blacklist them from traveling exhibitions. When an infestation does occur, it’s generally kept secret. The contract conservation teams that museums hire to remediate invasive mold often must vow confidentiality before they’re even allowed to see the damage. But a handful of researchers, from in-house conservators to university mycologists, are beginning to compare notes about the fungal infestations they’ve tackled in museum storage depots, monastery archives, crypts and cathedrals. A disquieting revelation has emerged from these discussions: there’s a class of molds that flourish in low humidity, long believed to be a sanctuary from decay. By trying so hard to protect artifacts, we’ve accidentally created the “perfect conditions for [these molds] to grow,” says Flavia Pinzari, a mycologist at the Council of National Research of Italy. “All the rules for conservation never considered these species.”\n\nThese molds—called xerophiles—can survive in dry, hostile environments such as volcano calderas and scorching deserts, and to the chagrin of curators across the world, they seem to have developed a taste for cultural heritage. They devour the organic material that abounds in museums—from fabric canvases and wood furniture to tapestries. They can also eke out a living on marble statues and stained-glass windows by eating micronutrients in the dust that accumulates on their surfaces. And global warming seems to be helping them spread.\n\nMost frustrating for curators, these xerophilic molds are undetectable by conventional means. But now, armed with new methods, several research teams are solving art history cold cases and explaining mysterious new infestations.\n\nThe xerophiles’ body count is rising: bruiselike stains on Leonardo da Vinci’s most famous self-portrait, housed in Turin. Brown blotches on the walls of King Tut’s burial chamber in Luxor. Pockmarks on the face of a saint in an 11th-century fresco in Kyiv. It’s not enough to find and identify the mold. Investigators are racing to determine the limits of xerophilic life and figure out which pieces of our cultural heritage are at the highest risk of infestation before the ravenous microbes set in.\n\nScandinavian museums have been some of the first to confront the effect of climate change on molds. Whereas certain parts of the planet are growing drier as temperatures rise, the Nordic countries are among those that are becoming wetter. Higher temperatures allow the air to hold more moisture, and extreme rainfall events called cloudbursts are occurring more frequently. Sea-bound Denmark, for example, which is already rainy, could receive more than 50 percent more winter rainfall by the end of this century.\n\nIn decades past local museums in Denmark could get away with storing their treasures in drafty basements, sheds and even barns—practices that are typical for small museums around the globe when funding is limited and they don’t have the luxury of purpose-built facilities. But rising humidity and increasing floods led to runaway mold infestations at several Danish institutions in the 2000s. In response, Danish museums invested tens of millions of dollars to develop centralized, climate-controlled storage facilities.\n\nIt’s a pattern that’s playing out in many parts of the world. As the climate becomes more erratic, museums are tightening the temperature and humidity controls for their collections to prevent mold growth. But paradoxically, these efforts may be creating the perfect niche for a different kind of mold.\n\nIn 2012 Danish museum conservator Camilla Jul Bastholm was patrolling one such climate-controlled facility—a newly retrofitted warehouse about an hour outside Copenhagen—when she spotted subtle white shimmers on a variety of items, including hats and cloaks. “It was tricky to see with the naked eye,” Bastholm says of the discoloration—“a whitish, brittle layer on the surface of the artifacts.”\n\nConventional wisdom would have suggested that these shimmering patches were pesticide blooms, an unfortunate legacy from past generations of conservators who sprayed their collections with pesticides such as DDT to keep insects and molds at bay. These chemicals absorbed into artifacts only to bubble up to the surface later in the form of white blotches. But Bastholm had seen these little white dots before. She was working in another repository as a contract conservator, the kind of consultant museums hire after a flood or leak. After eight hours in that facility, a colleague had “reacted like she had the beginning of the flu—her eyes running; she had a migraine.” To Bastholm, that sounded like exposure to a fungus, not a chemical.\n\nA close examination revealed that about half of the objects in the Roskilde Museum’s facility bore these worrisome white marks. Two museum employees developed the same flulike symptoms Bastholm had observed before. The staff were convinced they had a mold outbreak. Yet the building’s envelope was intact, with no evidence of leaks.\n\nTwice, museum leadership called in outside technicians to test for mold, a process that involves rubbing samples of potentially contaminated material onto a fungal growth medium—a gelatinous goo packed with nutrients and moisture to jump-start mold growth in a petri dish. The dishes bloomed black, yellow, brown and green with common molds, but nothing matched the enigmatic white marks.\n\nWhen Bastholm became the Roskilde Museum’s lead conservator in 2014, she ordered the facility—with its tens of thousands of historical objects—closed to all but essential traffic while she tried to solve the mystery. Three years later Bastholm got her first break. A Dutch mycologist who specializes in molds that affect food production suggested she cook up a very unusual fungal medium: a petri dish environment that would kill most fungi. When she cultured the samples on this inhospitable medium, with far too little water available to sustain most molds, her petri dishes suddenly looked like snow globes, covered with shimmering white flakes. Genetic analysis revealed they were four related species of xerophilic molds in a group known as Aspergillus section restricti.\n\nAround the same time Bastholm discovered the xerophile outbreak in Denmark in 2012, Flavia Pinzari, then a biologist at the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage in Rome, was investigating a fungal mystery of her own. Pinzari had been monitoring mold infestations at libraries and archives in Rome, Genoa and Modena over the previous decade. Staff reported feeling ill, and small white dots peppered ancient manuscripts and book bindings at six institutions—among them the Bibliotheca Angelica in Rome, Europe’s oldest public library and one of the world’s great collections of rare and ancient books. She wondered whether a classic conservation technique could be inviting a stealthy class of fungi into the collections.\n\nIn the 1600s the Bibliotheca Angelica was run by Augustinian friars, an order of religious scholars that the pope charged with determining which texts would become libri prohibiti—forbidden books destined for the Catholic Church’s bonfires of heretical material.\n\nTexts on astrology, alchemy, science and unorthodox religious thinking passed through the Augustinians’ hands. “The Augustinians studied them and censored them, but they did not destroy them,” Umberto D’Angelo, former director of the Bibliotheca Angelica, said in a press release. “Fortunately for us, they are all still here.” Today the Bibliotheca’s holdings include exquisite 11th-century illuminated manuscripts, one of the earliest copies of Dante’s Divine Comedy—and all those precious libri prohibiti.\n\nThe infestations Pinzari observed were unusual because they were happening in institutions with, as far as she could tell, adequate climate control. The only factor connecting the six infestations was the institutions’ use of mobile shelving systems called compactus units, refrigerator-size shelf blocks that slide on rails. Compactus units have been a fixture of museum and library storage since the 1950s because they save space and have an airtight seal, protecting their contents from invasive dust and mold spores.\n\nPinzari couldn’t get any of the white molds to grow on any fungal media. But she did have access to a high-powered microscope. Peering through the viewfinder, she saw fibrous tendrils with a riot of hairs—the signatures of Aspergillus section restricti.\n\nHow the mold might find a home in the compactus shelves was a mystery at the time. But in the decade since, Pinzari and other researchers have started to learn how these xerophilic species thrive where other molds can’t. They seem to remodel their environment, turning desert into oasis one tiny inhospitable patch at a time.\n\nTake Aspergillus halophilicus, one of the species behind both the Danish infestation and the Italian library outbreaks. Once a spore of A. halophilicus lands, Pinzari says, it sends out exploratory tendrils called hyphae that twist through cracks and crevices to search for nutrients. “It’s looking for water,” Pinzari explains, but if none is forthcoming, it’ll settle for salt crystals.\n\nSalt crystals are extraordinarily effective at absorbing moisture from the air. That’s why the contents of your saltshaker will turn into a solid block unless you put rice in it. A. halophilicus can collect salt from the environment and re-excrete it in the form of a salt-rich exopolymer—a kind of briny jelly that covers its hyphae. Researchers hypothesize that the exopolymer prevents the mold’s tissues from drying out and helps the mold maintain a layer of humid air in its immediate vicinity.\n\nPinzari believes that by trying so hard to control conditions inside compactus shelves, collection managers have accidentally handed the reins over to xerophilic fungi. With no airflow to disrupt their tiny artificial atmospheres, the molds have been able to reshape their surroundings to suit their needs. Ironically, artifacts might have been better off in those drafty Danish barns.\n\nFrom a conservator’s perspective, there’s lots to worry about in a xerophile’s remodeling plans. Sometimes xerophilic or xerotolerant fungi eat a museum artifact directly—munching on the egg-based tempera in a fresco, the cotton canvas of a painting or even the salty flesh of mummies.\n\nOther times the spores land on something the mold can’t directly consume, such as metal, glass, rubber, plastic or limestone. But some of the restricti species are “capable of living on almost nothing,” Pinzari says, surviving off the nutrients in motes of dust. In these cases, damage to artifacts is collateral, resulting from the mold’s remodeling activities and digestive processes and from the dying off of the hyphae.\n\nThat’s what researchers think happened at St. Sophia’s Cathedral, a 1,000-year-old holy site in Kyiv that has been described as the soul of all Ukraine. In 2010 brown blotches began to pockmark the cathedral’s precious 11th-century frescos, starting with the altar to the martyr St. Sophia. “It’s very painful because people love this cathedral very much,” says Marina Fomina, a microbiologist at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2025 Camilla Jul Bastholm received messages from institutions around the world that have experienced mold infestations they expect might be xerophilic but haven’t necessarily been made public.\n\nThe saint’s breakout came as a surprise on two counts. Not only has the cathedral been climate-controlled since the 1950s, but its wall paintings are buon frescos, meaning they were made of mineral compounds that contain no organic materials for mold to live on.\n\nFomina reached out to Pinzari after reading about her skirmishes with xerophiles in the Italian libraries. On Pinzari’s advice, Fomina tried to culture mold from the frescos on special fungal growth media. Nothing grew. The Ukrainian team was so alarmed about the damage that it arranged for costly molecular genetic analysis of samples from the paintings, which confirmed the presence of A. halophilicus.\n\nTo understand what was happening to the frescos, the managers of the cathedral gave Fomina permission to cut out some mold spots from a section of the fresco that had been restored in the 1950s. Under the microscope, she saw the unmistakable shape of A. halophilicus—it can resemble a tangle of spaghetti with fine, downy hairs—tunneling between layers of plaster, causing the surface of the fresco to crumble and flake. But curiously, these hyphae appeared to be covered with tiny crystals, like rock candy.\n\nIt seems that when A. halophilicus is surrounded by calcium, as in the chalky plaster, it secretes organic acids that turn calcium ions—which appear to be harmful to the mold—into benign crystals of calcium malate. The dark spots themselves were another by-product of this protective mechanism. The higher the concentration of the calcium minerals, the darker the mold’s pigments become, Fomina explains.\n\nXerophilic fungi aren’t entirely new to museums and cultural heritage sites. Italian archivists in the mid-1900s described outbreaks identical to the ones Pinzari observed, and orange stains that have been present on da Vinci’s most famous self-portrait since at least the 1950s have since been conclusively attributed to A. halophilicus. But it wasn’t until decades later that researchers began routinely using growth media with low levels of water available for microbial processes to coax out xerophilic fungi. One of the first to adopt these low-water activity media to test for elusive fungi on cultural items was Japanese microbiologist Hideo Arai, who used them to isolate mold on hemp-paper paintings in Byōdo-in Temple in Uji, Japan, in 1984. Later, in 1993, Arai used these specialized media to identify Aspergillus penicilloides as the culprit behind an infestation on the walls of King Tut’s burial chamber. The dark blotches from the mold had vexed researchers since soon after archaeologist Howard Carter opened the tomb in 1922.\n\nYet despite such high-profile cases, experts still believed that true xerophilic infestations were rare, a notion that persisted because the tools to detect them were so hard to obtain. Even today, decades after Arai’s pioneering work, access to these low-water activity media is extremely limited. “You can’t buy them industrially—nobody produces them,” Bastholm says. “If you want to detect these xerophilic fungi, you have to collaborate with research laboratories.”\n\nWhat’s more, some species are so persnickety that even low-water activity media won’t do the trick consistently. Fomina and her colleagues still haven’t been able to cultivate samples in the lab from the St. Sophia infestation, despite more than 10 years of trying. They keep at it because until scientists discover what makes a xerophile feel at home in a petri dish, there won’t be tests that museums can use to catch them without resorting to genetic testing that many institutions can’t afford.\n\nFomina and Pinzari suspect that part of the reason A. halophilicus is so hard to culture is that it may already be dead by the time conservators notice the infestation. Often found together with other xerophilic species, A. halophilicus seems to work as a pioneer: it arrives in an inhospitable environment and does its extraordinary DIY, and then other, less industrious molds swoop in to take advantage of the better growing conditions—potentially using dead A. halophilicus tissues as a resource to jump-start their own growth.\n\nThat’s how xerophilic fungi seem to have flown under the radar for so long. When a moldy artifact is swabbed on conventional, high-water activity media, only garden-variety fungi grow. Museums assume they’ve done something wrong with the storage—that humidity had risen higher than they realized, or a leak went undetected—and keep the matter under wraps, for fear of looking careless. The xerophilic molds elude detection and continue to wreak havoc. The problem “is much more diffuse than we might think,” Pinzari asserts.\n\nOnce a museum identifies a mold infestation, it faces the difficult question of how to stop it. Through the 1970s conservators deployed biocides, chemicals—including antibiotics and formaldehyde—that wipe out microbes indiscriminately. That’s what experts used in 1963 when green algae threatened the 17,000-year-old depictions of aurochs, horses and deer found in France’s famed Lascaux Cave. But just as broad-spectrum antibiotics can wreak havoc on the human gut by eliminating good bacteria along with the bad, biocides can open the door to even more harmful microbes by clearing out the competition.\n\nScientists think decades of treatment with biocides in Lascaux led to the proliferation of a fungus called Fusarium solani that covered the cave like snow in a matter of days. The biocides are also thought to have allowed antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and fungi to grow unchecked in the cave, as well as pigmented fungi that left permanent dark stains on the Ice Age images. In Europe, the use of biocides is now tightly restricted.\n\nOne of the only options for large-scale infestations—for example, in libraries and archives—is fumigation. But some of the substances used in fumigation leave residues that can eventually degrade the material, says Katherina Derksen, a painting conservator and microbiologist at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Some of these chemicals can also pose a risk to human health.\n\nWhen a mold’s takeover of an artifact must be stopped, there’s gamma radiation—pelting it with electromagnetic energy from radioactive decay to kill fungi and spores. But this technique penetrates deeply and can extensively damage materials. In some cases, “you lose both microbes and the object you’re trying to save,” says Katja Sterflinger, a geomicrobiologist and heritage scientist at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.\n\nThat leaves conservators with only a basic tool kit for containing a fungal outbreak: quarantine infested objects, vacuum off the worst of the mold, and treat affected items with ethanol when possible. That’s what they ultimately had to do at the Roskilde Museum, the Danish institution where Bastholm found the xerophiles.\n\nIn 2023, nine years after Bastholm closed off the Roskilde Museum’s storage facility, the museum’s governing board decided it was time to reclaim the place. “We’ve been afraid of it,” says Isabella No’omi Fuglø, the museum’s chief of collections. In 2025, after two years of strategizing, a small group of conservators finally suited up in protective gear and headed into the mold-ridden warehouse.\n\nOne day last fall I donned a mask and protective clothing to tour the storage facility, then several weeks into its rehabilitation. My guide was curator and collections manager Maja Lindholm Kvamm. Kitted out in a white cloth jumpsuit and respirator, with an industrial-grade vacuum in tow, she looked like a Ghostbuster in an astronaut helmet.\n\nOver the course of the summer Kvamm and a team of about 15 people, including student assistants from a local conservator’s school, had handled more than 100,000 objects—from oyster shells to paintings and carriages—inspecting them for mold and scraping off the dirt and dust of the ages.\n\nKvamm says they were relieved to find the museum’s archaeological treasures—among them stone age relics and Viking artifacts discovered by hobbyist metal detectorists—were largely spared from contamination, although the same couldn’t be said for the boxes containing them. But other items were beyond saving or too fragile to clean with conventional means. “A big part of the cleaning process is figuring out what the object can handle—even just being touched,” Fuglø says.\n\nAs I wandered aisles stacked high with boxes of paintings, antique furniture and the occasional Viking age skeleton, I found several parcels wrapped in plastic and labeled “SKIM!!!”—short for skimelsvamp, “mold” in Danish. Inside one was fish skin so riddled with mold “it was basically alive,” Kvamm recalls. It falls to Kvamm to determine what mold-damaged objects are worth the effort to stabilize and restore, she explains. “Is the story [behind the object] interesting enough? Do we know where it’s from? Do we have similar objects?”\n\nDisposing of a mold-eaten object in a museum’s collection is a bureaucratic nightmare. “You have to ask other museums if they might be interested,” Kvamm explains. “You have to [try] to track down the person who donated the item and ask them if they want to have it back.” Once those hurdles are cleared, she anticipates a multimonth dialogue with the Ministry of Culture before she will finally be allowed to do away with her gross fish skin.\n\nFor moldy items in the Roskilde Museum collection that are deemed salvageable, Kvamm makes several passes with her vacuum hose interspersed with gentle scrubbing with a brush. She then caps off those efforts with a judicious spritz of ethanol.\n\nBut even the objects that have no signs of mold receive the tender ministrations of Kvamm and her team. They delicately wipe off motes of dust to make it harder for mold to take up residence again. “We don’t have anything else we can do now but clean it and then just keep checking on it,” Fuglø admits.\n\nTo figure out better ways to prevent and treat xerophilic mold infestations, scientists need a better understanding of the molds’ basic biology—namely, the conditions under which they falter and thrive. To that end, Sterflinger and her team in Vienna are busy trying to determine just how little water xerophilic molds can survive on. Yet even if researchers do identify a moisture level that’s safe from xerophilic molds, Sterflinger says it’s untenable to bring overall humidity levels in storage facilities down much lower than they already are: climate control is expensive and a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which museums are under pressure to curb.\n\nInstead they’ll have to determine which materials are most vulnerable to xerophilic and xerotolerant molds, Derksen says. That way collection managers can decide which items need more stringent and energy-intensive storage conditions. Future storage facilities could designate a small space with the tightest climate control for more sensitive objects, she says.\n\nDerksen is conducting mold censuses in “healthy” museums without infestations so they can develop surveillance techniques that will detect surges in particular mold species before they’ve reached a level visible to the human eye.\n\nThe researchers agree we need to learn all we can from the organisms found in the artificially extreme environments of museums. The lessons aren’t just relevant to art conservation. These weird species—some of which are new to science—are likely to pop up in other places that people are trying to keep unnaturally sterile.\n\nXerophilic fungi have infested food-production facilities from Belgian chocolate factories to meat-curing operations in Italy. In 2024 an infestation of Aspergillus flavus—a xerophilic mold species involved in some museum outbreaks—was discovered in Denmark’s biggest hospital, sickening pediatric cancer patients and contributing to several deaths, including that of an 11-year-old boy. Xerophilic molds can colonize human tissue in immunocompromised people—doctors found colonies of Aspergillus fumigatus, another mold involved in museum infestations, in one Danish woman’s brain, chest and lungs after she had been treated for leukemia in the contaminated wards. Other scientists hope to put the xerophiles’ remodeling powers to good use, deploying them to break down pollutants and sequester harmful metals.\n\nThe museum mold hunters are thankful for the institutions taking them into their confidence. Letting go of the shame is the only way we can learn about these molds, Pinzari says. Bastholm says that in 2025, she received a flood of messages from institutions around the world that have experienced mold infestations they suspect might be xerophilic but haven’t necessarily been made public—from across Europe, the U.S., Pakistan, Israel and Asia. Still the stigma remains strong. None agreed to be interviewed on the record for this article.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

    "description": "Vortex is a new columnar file format with a very promising design. SpiralDB and DuckDB Labs have partnered to give you a very fast experience while reading and writing Vortex files!",
    "fullText": "TL;DR: Vortex is a new columnar file format with a very promising design. SpiralDB and DuckDB Labs have partnered to give you a very fast experience while reading and writing Vortex files!\n\nI think it is worth starting this intro by talking a little bit about the established format for columnar data. Parquet has done some amazing things for analytics. If you go back to the times where CSV was the better alternative, then you know how important Parquet is. However, even if the specification has evolved over time, Parquet has some design constraints. A particular limitation is that it is block-compressed and engines need to decompress pages in order to do further operations like filtering, decoding values, etc. For a while, researchers and private companies have been working on alternatives to Parquet that could improve on some of Parquet’s shortcomings. Vortex, from the SpiralDB team, is one of them.\n\nVortex is an extensible, open source format for columnar data. It was created to handle heterogeneous compute patterns and different data modalities. But, what does this mean?\n\nThe project was donated to the Linux Foundation by the SpiralDB team in August 2025.\n\nVortex provides different layouts and encodings for different data types. Some of the most notorious are ALP for floating point encoding or FSST for string encoding. This lightweight compression strategy keeps data sizes down while allowing one of Vortex’s most important features: compute functions. By knowing the encoded layout of the data, Vortex is able to run arbitrary expressions on compressed data. This allows a Vortex reader to execute, for example, filter expressions within storage segments without decompressing data.\n\nWe mentioned heterogeneous compute to emphasize that Vortex was designed with the idea of having optimized layouts for different data types, including vectors, large text or even image or audio, but also to maximize CPU or GPU saturation. The idea is that decompression is deferred all the way to the GPU or CPU, enabling what Vortex calls “late materialization”. The FastLanes encoding, a project originating at CWI (like DuckDB), is one of the main drivers behind this feature.\n\nVortex also supports dynamically loaded libraries (similar to DuckDB extensions) to provide new encodings for specific types as well as specific compute functions, e.g. for geospatial data. Another very interesting feature is encoding WebAssembly into the file, which can allow the reader to benefit from specific compute kernels applied to the file.\n\nBesides DuckDB, other engines such as DataFusion, Spark and Arrow already offer integration with Vortex.\n\nDuckDB is a database as the name says, yes, but it is also widely used as an engine to query many different data sources. Through core or community extensions, DuckDB can integrate with:\n\nThe community has gotten very creative, though, so these days you can even read YAML and Markdown with DuckDB using community extensions.\n\nAll this is possible due to the DuckDB extension system, which makes it relatively easy to implement logic to interact with different file formats or external systems.\n\nThe SpiralDB team built a DuckDB extension. Together with the DuckDB Labs team, we have made the extension available as a core DuckDB extension, so that the community can enjoy Vortex as a first-class citizen in DuckDB.\n\nInstalling and using the Vortex extension is very simple:\n\nThen, you can easily use it to read and write, similar to other extensions such as Parquet.\n\nVortex claims to do well primarily at three use cases:\n\nThe promise of more efficient IO and memory use through late decompression is a good reason to try DuckDB and Vortex for SQL analytics. On another note, if you are looking at running analytics on unified datasets that are used for multiple use cases, including pre-processing pipelines and AI training, then Vortex may be a good candidate since it is designed to fit all of these use cases well.\n\nFor those who are number hungry, we decided to run a TPC-H benchmark scale factor 100 with DuckDB to understand how Vortex can perform as a storage format compared to Parquet. We tried to make the benchmark as fair as possible. These are the parameters:\n\nThe results are very good. The TPC-H benchmark runs 18% faster with respect to Parquet V2 and 35% faster than Parquet V1 (using the geometric means, which is the recommended approach).\n\nAnother interesting result is the standard deviation across runs. There was a considerable difference between the first (and coldest) run of each query and subsequent runs in Parquet, while Vortex performed very well across all runs with a much smaller standard deviation.\n\nThe times did vary across different runs of the same benchmark, and subsequent runs have yielded similar results but with slight variations. The differences between Parquet v2 and Vortex have always been around 12-18% in geometric means and around 8-14% in total times. Benchmarking is very hard!\n\nThis figure shows the results per query, including the standard deviation error bar.\n\nThe following is the summary of the sizes of the datasets. Note that both Parquet v1 and v2 are using the default compression used by the DuckDB Parquet writer, which is Snappy. In this case, Vortex is not using any general purpose compression but still keeps the data sizes competitive.\n\nVortex is a very interesting alternative to established columnar formats like Parquet. Its focus on lightweight compression encodings, late decompression and being able to run compute expressions on compressed data makes it very interesting for a wide range of use cases. With regard to DuckDB, we see that Vortex is already very performant for analytical queries, where it is on par or better than Parquet v2 on the TPC-H benchmark queries.\n\nVortex has been backwards compatible since version 0.36.0, which was released more than 6 months ago. Vortex is now at version 0.56.0.",

    "fullText": "The Federal Trade Commission filed a notice on Tuesday appealing its loss in a lawsuit that accused Meta of breaking antitrust laws to protect a monopoly in social networking.\n\nAt a trial last year, Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia considered the government’s claims that Meta snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago. He ruled in November that Meta had not broken the law.\n\n“Meta violated our antitrust laws when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp,” an agency spokesman, Joe Simonson, said. “Thankfully for Americans, there is an appeal process.”\n\nA Meta spokesman, Christopher Sgro, said in a statement that Judge Boasberg’s “decision to reject the F.T.C.’s arguments is correct, and recognizes the fierce competition we face.”\n\nThe F.T.C. is aiming to reverse a setback in the government’s campaign to rein in the power of the biggest tech companies. In the last two years, the government has won federal antitrust cases against Google, with judges saying the company has monopolies in online search and advertising technology. It has also sued Amazon and Apple over monopoly concerns.\n\nJudge Boasberg’s six-week trial in the lawsuit against Meta featured testimony from witnesses including Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, and an Instagram founder, Kevin Systrom.\n\nThe government argued that Meta bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014 to get rid of the threat posed by young competitors.\n\nJudge Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta’s arguments that changes in social media, including the growth of TikTok and YouTube, undercut the government’s case about Meta’s dominance.\n\nThe F.T.C.’s notice of appeal on Tuesday, filed in the District Court, is preliminary. The agency will lay out its legal argument for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit at a later date.",

    "description": "Having bought a share in every Hang Seng company, he opposed any manoeuvre by the market’s big players that disadvantaged smaller punters",
    "fullText": "​David Webb, who has died aged 60, was an activist investor, a seeker of truth in the murky shoals of the Hong Kong stock market and an advocate for freedom in the territory’s increasingly repressed political climate.\n\nA mathematician and computer games designer in his youth, Webb was a thorn in the side of Hong Kong’s establishment as the publisher of Webb-site.com, a compendious and accessible database of information on companies, directors, controlling owners and cross-shareholdings as well as public bodies, the judiciary and many other aspects of local life.\n\nAs a spotter of undervalued stocks, meanwhile, he amassed a personal fortune by outperforming the Hang Seng index on average by 12 percentage points per year (in his own calculation) between 1995 and 2018. For some years he also published an annual single-stock Christmas tip which did even better for those w​ho followed it.\n\nBut his primary drive was as a campaigner. Having bought a share in every Hang Seng company, he opposed any manoeuvre by the market’s big players that disadvantaged smaller punters and fought successfully for a shift to “poll voting” rather than decision-making by show of hands at shareholders’ meetings.\n\nOne of his bravest investigations, published by Webb-site in 2017 as “The Enigma Network: 50 Stocks Not To Own”, detailed crossholdings in a large group of connected companies, many of whose shares plunged as a result of the revelations. Earlier, he had taken on the might of the Li family, Hong Kong’s richest, by demanding transparency as to how one of their companies was granted land to develop the Cyberport business park without a formal tender process.\n\nAs to politics, Webb made clear his support for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and shone a spotlight on cosy dealings between tycoons and Beijing-approved politicians. “In many ways, he was the Hong Kong government’s nightmare,” wrote a fellow activist, “a brilliant investor who was able to articulate the relationship between free markets and a broader concept of civil and political freedom.”\n\nDavid Michael Webb was born to an Australian single mother in London on August 29 1965. Adopted by a couple from Leicester – Michael Webb, an economics lecturer, and his wife Veronica, an optician – he spent part of his childhood in Thailand, where his father took a job with the UN advising public utilities. He was educated at an international school in Bangkok run by American nuns which – he later observed, “probably helped inform my atheism”.\n\nScience and mathematics became his passions. In his teens he wrote games for the pioneering Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer and published a user’s handbook, Supercharge Your Spectrum (1983). He went on to read maths – and start dabbling in shares – at Exeter College, Oxford, before embarking on a career in investment banking with Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.\n\nHaving moved to BZW’s Hong Kong office in 1991, Webb was one of a team who left in due course to join a joint venture between NatWest and the Wheelock real estate group. Already wealthy from private investing, he stepped out in 1998 to focus his energies on the Webb-site project.\n\nHis analytical skills were recognised as a long-serving member of the takeovers and mergers panel of the Securities and Futures Commission. He was also elected in 2003 as an independent director of the parent company of the Hong Kong stock exchange but resigned in 2008 in protest at what he saw as government interference and lack of care for investors.\n\nIn essence, no corporate stitch-up was exempt from his scrutiny. Even in the exclusive Hong Kong Club, of which he was a devoted member, he was capable of stirring constitutional trouble. But behind the intensity and acerbic willingness to offend was a caring friend to those who knew him best.\n\nIn 2018, he told a student audience that he believed that by the time Hong Kong’s status as a “special administration region” expires in 2047, “China will be an open, democratic and truly prosperous country, [and] I hope to be around to see it.”\n\nHe was robbed of that hope by a diagnosis in 2020 of metastatic prostate cancer, which he announced to his 28,000 Webb-site followers with: “Unfortunately, there are going to be some changes around here”. Managing his treatments with the same forensic focus he brought to investment, he continued fighting his causes for as long as he was able – though more cautious in the last stage for fear that his family’s assets might be seized.\n\nAt Exeter College, Webb endowed a tutorial fellowship in computer science and a prize for academic excellence. He had also hoped Hong Kong University would allow him to endow a Webb Centre for Public Transparency but the proposal was rejected.\n\nIn last year’s birthday honours he was appointed MBE “for services to raising standards of corporate economic governance, particularly in Hong Kong”. He is survived by his wife Karen and their two sons.\n\nDavid Webb, born August 29 1965, died January 13 2026​",

    "fullText": "This checklist helps you move from Germany to another country.\n\nKeep your phone number. You might need it for online banking and two-factor authentication.\n\nSole proprietorships are easy to close. If you have an AG, UG or GmbH, it’s much more complicated.9 Ask a tax advisor to help you.\n\nIf you are part of a Handwerkskammer, Berufskammer or Berufsgenossenschaft, you must also deregister there.19\n\nThese things keep working even if you don’t live in Germany:\n\nDo not close your bank account. You can keep your bank account after you deregister your address and leave Germany.8\n\nYou need it to get your apartment deposit, last paycheck, yearly bonus, tax return and blocked account payments.25\n\nUse Wise to transfer your money to another country.\n\nIf you have a blocked account, you can close it after you leave Germany. You might need a Sperrfreigabe from a German embassy, consulate or Ausländerbehörde.13\n\nWhen you stop working, tell your health insurer. Unemployment changes the cost of your health insurance. If you get unemployment benefits, it pays for your health insurance.\n\nWhen you disenrol from university, your school tells your health insurer. Your public health insurance might become more expensive without the student discount.\n\nWhen you leave Germany, your health insurance might stop working:\n\nTo cancel your health insurance, you need an Abmeldebescheinigung.7 When you leave Germany, the notice period is until the end of the month.29 If you don’t cancel your insurance, your insurer will keep charging you.\n\nIf you plan to return to Germany, get an Anwartschaft from your insurer. You pay a monthly fee to pause your health insurance, and resume it later. When you return to Germany, you will get the same tariff and coverage, even if your situation or your health changed. Without an Anwartschaft, it can be hard to find affordable health insurance.16\n\nUsually, when you leave Germany, you stop paying income tax in Germany.\n\nYou might still have to pay taxes in Germany if…27\n\nFor example, if you officially live in Spain, but your family lives in Berlin, you often go to a German doctor, and you own an empty apartment in Berlin, the Finanzamt might still tax you.\n\nUsually, there is no exit tax on your stocks and ETFs.30 You only pay the capital gains tax when you sell.\n\nExample 1: While you lived in Germany, you invested €500,000 in the iShares MSCI World ETF. You must pay an exit tax.\n\nExample 2: You invest €250,000 in two different ETFs. There is no exit tax, because you did not invest €500,000 in a single ETF.\n\nExample 3: You invest €400,000 in one ETF, and it’s now worth €500,000.

    "description": "In tukdam, clinically dead meditators are said to dwell in the luminosity of emptiness",
    "fullText": "While the non-decaying tukdam body signifies the presence of consciousness for Tibetans, this is not obvious from a biophysical scientific perspective. Indeed, the Center for Healthy Minds has been looking for possible residual activity in the brainstem—a primitive part of the brain not thought to be involved in consciousness—as a factor contributing to the unusual integration of the bodies. In 2021, the research team published a null-finding stating they had not found any activity in the brain so far. Compelled to operate within a biophysical paradigm, scientists are also interested in possible changes to cell metabolism and breakdown, brought about by years of meditation practice, as perhaps contributing to the pristine postmortem state of tukdam bodies. But taking samples from the bodies has so far been out of the question due to cultural sensitivity and the sacredness of these deaths. Tibetans are concerned that invasive procedures could disturb the postmortem meditative state and the potential it carries for spiritual liberation and achieving a good rebirth.\n\nAn exchange from Tukdam: Between Worlds illustrates some of the tensions and cross-purposes with which the scientists and Tibetan parties have been operating, although there have been developments in the research and collaboration since the time of shooting in 2019 to early 2020. The scene shows a meeting where Dr. Dylan Lott, who was then the Tukdam Project manager in India, presents the current state of the research and its findings to Tibetan project collaborators. The Dalai Lama’s personal physician, Dr. Tsetan Dorji Sadutshang, expresses frustration over the lack of results from years of research and what he sees as a misguided approach to explain tukdam in neuroscientific terms. According to the Tibetan view, something far more subtle than the “gross” mind related to the brain and senses is responsible for the physical signs of tukdam.\n\nTo me, from my understanding of His Holiness’ hope from this project, really is to have some proof that there is some sort of consciousness . . . or a mind continuing, that goes on beyond this life, basically. The only first kindergarten step is really to say: Is there a difference between a gross mind and a subtle mind?\n\nWe cannot prove rebirth. We cannot prove mind. We cannot prove subtle mind. What we can do is look at the effects of those practices on the body that are unusual and that Western science, or medical science, doesn’t have a good explanation for.\n\nAs is the case with science, it is not obvious to all Buddhist traditions that a non-decomposing body proves the presence of consciousness. The medieval Chinese Chan tradition, for example, also records miraculously preserved meditators’ bodies. These did not, however, signify present consciousness, which according to widespread Buddhist doctrine, departs immediately at death to be reborn or to enter nirvana. Here the body is preserved due to purification by religious practice and virtue accumulated while alive.\n\nThere is something paradoxical in taking the non-decaying body as evidence for a consciousness that transcends the body and physicality. However, here we should be careful to note that in the Tibetan Buddhist tantric tradition different levels of mind are associated with different types of embodiment. Subtler forms of consciousness are associated with tantric subtle bodies or physiologies familiar to advanced tantric practitioners. As these are in a way two sides of the same coin, mind always affects body and vice versa. Such subtle bodies are arguably different from, though connected to, the “gross” biomedical body that scientists work with, which also shows effects of subtle levels of mind and embodiment.\n\nTibetan tradition exhibits a great deal of sophistication and specificity when it comes to signs or ways of ascertaining whether a person is in tukdam—as well as when it ends. The body will slump over if it was sitting upright; smell and normal signs of decomposition will appear. In accordance with subtle tantric physiology, red and white liquids may come out the nostrils and genitals. These are all signs that even the most subtle consciousness has departed. For Tibetans, final death occurs when the mind leaves the body, which could be weeks after clinical death in cases of tukdam,or hours to days for “normal” deaths.\n\nThere is also a tantalizing tradition of ending tukdam that could be seen as indicative of consciousness. If tukdam goes on too long, it may be ended by ringing a bell near the ear of the deceased practitioner, saying certain prayers, or asking them to end their meditation. The body then reportedly collapses and decomposition takes over. This could imply responsivity on the part of the deceased meditators, bearing on questions of consciousness. In an interview piece that did not make the final cut of my documentary, the Dalai Lama recounted this story:\n\nOne lama I had a very close connection [with] . . . Last few years his physical [condition] was very, very weak. And then in my last meeting in Mongolia, I told him, “Now time has come. You have to think about your next life.” Then around the end of the year, with New Year soon, I received one message from him: “When I should die? Where I should die?” . . . Quite silly, “where I should die, when I should die!” Then accordingly I also answered a silly sort of answer, “You should die in Mongolia. The time, not end of the year but the beginning of the year, New Year.” He exactly, I think in the first week of the New Year, then he died. Then I sent my representative with my [ceremonial silk] scarf. I think it took two days . . . When my representative reached his place and put the scarf which I sent . . . on his neck, then he ended his tukdam. [Dalai Lama makes gesture of body slumping over.] So these are quite mysterious things. There are some elements to control. It is quite obvious as soon as the tukdam ends, the physical [body] clearly shows real death, the real corpse.\n\nPeople often report feeling a meditative calm or presence when entering the room of someone in tukdam. Some of the American scientists researching tukdam also said they felt it. But such things seem difficult to measure and to be firmly in the realm of first-person experience as opposed to the third-person observation of natural science. This does not, however, necessarily make such perceptions less real. As another Tukdam Project collaborator, senior Tibetan medicine doctor Tsewang Tamdin, told me, “Just because something is invisible does not mean it does not exist.”\n\nAs in life and death, the dynamic of presence and absence is central to tukdam. Here we come to a basic conflict between the Tibetan Buddhist and current biomedical views of death. For the latter, death unequivocally means absence. Once the heart shuts down, brain death quickly follows “unless it’s been inflicted before the heart stopped” and the person is gone. But for Tibetan Buddhists, there is presence, or mind, in death.\n\n*Richard Davidson is a member of the Rubin Museum’s advisory board.",

    "description": "Despite geopolitical upheaval, sanctions, and military action, this South American state's proven oil reserves remain colossal.",
    "fullText": "When it comes to oil-rich countries, one would usually think of Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia or Iraq. But what many do not know is that the country with the largest oil reserves in the world lies just 1,200 miles to the south of Florida — or about a three-and-a-half-hour flight across the Caribbean. This is the state of Venezuela, and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that its oil reserves are at more than 303 billion barrels, as of 2025.\n\nMost of Venezuela's oil is in the Orinoco Belt, a swathe of land north of the Orinoco River, but extracting it poses an unusual set of challenges. The country's oil infrastructure needs to be overhauled due to years of mismanagement and corruption and a history of asset seizures from private companies by the state. The country is also under U.S. sanctions, which limit its ability to sell oil overseas.\n\nVenezuela's crude oil isn't easy to process, either. Saudi Arabian and American oil fields produce light, sweet crude oil, which contains very little sulfur, and isn't corrosive to pipes and equipment. On the other hand, Venezuelan oil is much harder to process because it's mostly heavy and sour, making it harder to process crude oil into unleaded gasoline. Prof. Paasha Mahdavi of the University of California, Santa Barbara, told NPR that it's \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming.\"\n\nAside from Venezuela, other countries that have massive reserves include Saudi Arabia (267 billion barrels), Iran (208 billion barrels), Iraq (145 billion barrels), and the United Arab Emirates (113 billion barrels). The United States sits in the top eight, with an estimated 45 billion barrels of crude oil in reserve.\n\nOne thing that allowed the U.S. to massively increase its oil reserves and become one of the top 10 countries with the largest oil reserves is the development of fracking. Unlike traditional oil extraction techniques, which siphoned oil deposits from porous material, fracking pumps a special type of fluid deep underground to break the dense rock that holds the oil and make it easier to extract.\n\nOther nations are continually exploring to find new oil fields within their borders, and the U.S. made a new discovery in Texas in January 2026, which potentially has 1.6 billion barrels of oil. So, if there's a new substantial find or new technologies are developed to efficiently extract more oil from existing wells, then it's possible that another state can overtake Venezuela as the largest oil reserve holder in the world.",

    "fullText": "Jake Tapper shamed Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday after the White House press secretary lied about President Donald Trump confusing Greenland for Iceland in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.\n\nPosting a video to his personal X account, the CNN host mocked Leavitt for arguing that the president wasn’t “mixing anything up.”\n\n“I mean, you know that that was filmed, right?” Tapper asked incredulously.\n\nWatch the video of Tapper’s breakdown — which includes the clips in question — below:\n\n“Earlier today, in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump, at least three times referred to Greenland, a territory he wants to seize or purchase from Denmark, three times referred to Greenland as Iceland,” Tapper said before introducing Leavitt’s defense.\n\n“When a reporter went on X and pointed this out, the White House press secretary, whose salary your tax dollars pay for, wrote, ‘No he didn’t Libby, his written remarks referred to Greenland as a piece of ice because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here. OK?'”\n\nA claim to which Tapper replied: “Let’s roll the tape.”\n\nSpeaking in Davos on Wednesday, there were unmistakably several instances where Trump said “Iceland” when he meant to say “Greenland.” “When I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy,” he said in one moment; “Our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money,” he said in another.\n\n“This all reminds me of this great, horrifying quote from George Orwell’s dystopian novel ‘1984,’” Tapper pondered on his social video.\n\n“‘The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,'” the host quoted. “But we don’t live in 1984 and we don’t have to reject the evidence of our eyes and ears. We know that he confused Iceland with Greenland or Greenland with Iceland. And I mean, you can lie to us if you want, but I don’t know why it’s worth it.”\n\nThe post Jake Tapper Shames Karoline Leavitt for Lying About Trump’s Greenland-Iceland Mix-Up: ‘Let’s Roll the Tape’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

We appreciate the professionalism of all parties involved,” a spokesperson for the team told the media.\n\nLee’s agent, Scott Boras, told the San Francisco Chronicle it was “not anything political or anything like that.”\n\nDetentions by federal agents have become a hot-button issue amid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nLee arrived at LAX ahead of an appearance at the Giants’ FanFest in San Ramon on Saturday. The tour, which has multiple stops across Northern California, gives fans a chance to meet players and coaches.\n\nLee is of South Korean descent, but he was born in Nagoya, Japan, where his father, Korean baseball star Jong Beom Lee, was playing for the Chunichi Dragons, according to his MLB profile. During his introductory press conference, Lee called himself “Grandson of the Wind.” His father is known as “Son of the Wind.”\n\nLee made his debut in the majors in March 2024 after playing for the Kiwoom Heroes in Korea for seven years. Lee agreed to a six-year contract with the Giants worth $113 million in December 2023, ESPN reported, citing unnamed sources, at the time.\n\nThe Giants will begin spring training for the 2026 season in Scottsdale, Arizona, in early February.",

Speaking to Sean Hannity, the MAGA podcaster appeared unable to fathom the backlash after telling the Fox News host in December that he was essentially being a shill when he suggested in 2024 that the pipe bombs placed outside Republican and Democratic headquarters in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, were likely an “inside job.” “When I made this comment on your show, the morons in the media were apparently unaware that I was paid for a political commentary show,” a visibly sweaty Bongino told Hannity on Thursday. “This was news to them, Sean, they’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, Dan Bongino was paid as a...’—me and you were laughing about this the next day, like, this is stupid, this was a big scandal in the media.”",

    "fullText": "In cities across Australia, fleets of nice-looking electric buses quietly ferry thousands of commuters each day. But new warnings from cybersecurity experts have transformed what once looked like a clean energy success story into a geopolitical flashpoint.\n\nOfficials in Australia and the United Kingdom now say some Chinese-made buses may contain code that theoretically lets the buses’ manufacturer shut them down remotely via a so-called “kill switch.”\n\nThe revelation has renewed global fears about foreign-controlled technology embedded in critical infrastructure.\n\nThe spotlight is on the Yutong-made battery-electric buses. It’s a major Chinese manufacturer whose vehicles have been widely purchased in Australia’s capital, Canberra, and other jurisdictions.\n\nBritish reports, citing tests by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre and Transport for the UK government, found that similar models in Europe could be accessed remotely by the manufacturer’s systems, including diagnostics and software updates, and that, theoretically, such access could be used to stop a bus’s drive system.\n\nThis marks a dramatic escalation in cyber-risk warnings tied that aren’t about phone networks or internet routers but about public transit vehicles. Transport Canberra reportedly responded by launching a fresh investigation into cybersecurity risks linked to the buses, following the British analysis and earlier flags from Norwegian transit authorities who found what they termed a functional remote shutdown capability during tests.\n\nTo cyber researchers, the worry is not that a Chinese government operator is now flipping switches in real time, since there aren’t any confirmed cases of foreign actors actively disabling buses. The concern is that the vulnerability exists at all in imported vehicles that operate on public streets and, in some cases, carry government employees and personnel.\n\n“This isn’t just about buses,” Australian cybersecurity expert Alastair MacGibbon told local media. “It goes to how much control is embedded in the technology we import, and whether those controls could be abused.”\n\nThis episode in neighboring Australia (ally, we mean) reads like vindication for policymakers in the US who have long sounded the alarm over dependencies on Chinese technology.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy and other hardliners have repeatedly asserted that Chinese-linked vehicles and connected technologies pose unacceptable security risks — even going so far as to say China should never sell cars (or similarly connected vehicles) on American roads “as long as I have breath in my body.”\n\nWhile those comments were dismissed as bluster by critics, the Australian “kill-switch” story has suddenly given them a concrete, globally reported incident to point to.\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration tightened restrictions on connected vehicles containing Chinese software or hardware, with new rules designed to ban such imports by model year 2027 — a response to precisely the kinds of national security vulnerabilities highlighted by the Australian case.\n\nOpponents of these policies argue that connectivity features, including remote diagnostics and over-the-air updates, are standard across the global auto and transit industries, not unique to Chinese manufacturers.\n\nIndeed, any modern vehicle with internet connectivity might in theory be accessed remotely, whether made in Beijing, Detroit, or Tokyo. Critics in China have taken to global media to warn that U.S. bans could backfire by raising costs and supply chain challenges for American automakers dependent on global components.\n\nBut for many U.S. national security experts, the defining issue isn’t simply connectivity but control. If a foreign company can access the mission-critical systems of vehicles running on public streets — or the energy grids, solar inverters, or AI systems that undergird modern life — then that access becomes a lever that adversaries could exploit during crises.\n\nThe Australian episode has already spurred official reviews of every Yutong model in service. Transport Canberra officials insist there is no immediate operational concern based on current investigations, and that local buses are updated via physical service centers rather than remote connectivity.\n\nBut the warning’s broader resonance has rippled through capitals from London to Canberra, Oslo to Washington: as nations electrify their transit fleets and embrace connected vehicles, they must also reckon with who controls that connectedness.\n\nAnd for American lawmakers who warned loudly (and, in the eyes of some, prematurely) that Chinese technology on wheels isn’t just another import, this moment may well feel like a long-anticipated reckoning.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump spent two hours on Truth Social attacking his enemies and reposting praise after world leaders ignored his “Board of Peace” ceremony in Davos.\n\nThe 79-year-old president shared almost a post a minute on Thursday, hours after his “Board of Peace” initiative at the World Economic Forum attracted a motley crew of Trump-allied leaders from the Middle East and South America.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nSubjects covered in the posting barrage include a video of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller bashing Trump’s enemies, a court victory that will allow ICE to use force against protestors in Minnesota, 2020 election fraud conspiracies, threats to sue the New York Times for publishing polls that displease him, and rants against Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith was publicly testifying before Congress about the case he had built against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election when the president wrote, “Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”\n\nThe president’s posting rampage comes at the end of a humiliating and widely criticized trip to the World Economic Forum.\n\nAfter giving a speech on Wednesday in which he intimated the U.S. could take control of Greenland, Trump met with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, who apparently talked him down. Trump walked away from the meeting claiming he’d gotten the “framework of a deal” for the United States on Greenland, but didn’t give any specifics.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump suffered a fresh humiliation at the “Board of Peace” signing party.\n\nThe White House hyped the “Board of Peace” initiative, which nations can join for a $1 billion fee, as a coalition of nations that “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”\n\nThough the White House expected representatives from 35 countries at the ceremony, fewer than 20 showed up. World leaders otherwise in attendance at Davos, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, all ignored Trump’s endeavor.\n\nTrump was left signing what critics called a MAGA-fied U.N. charter with the likes of Argentinian President Javier Milei and far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban.\n\nTrump called every world leader who signed onto the Board of Peace a “great friend of mine.”\n\nShortly after Trump’s posting spree concluded, his account adopted a different, more optimistic tone.\n\n“Heading back to D.C. It was an incredible time in Davos,” Trump posted at 1:45 pm. “The Greenland structure is being worked on, and will be amazing for the U.S.A., and the Board of Peace is something that the World has never seen before — Very special. So many good things happening! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",

    "fullText": "In the quest for excellent Japanese family sedan comfort and reliability, the Camry and Crown are two of the best. Both of these Toyota family sedans are quiet and efficient. They share Toyota’s latest hybrid know-how and a reputation for long-term reliability. While they might be aimed at different buyers, they have \n\nJust for numbers’ sake, the current Camry ($29,000 base) outsells the Crown ($41,440 base) by a factor of more than 10. Granted, they’re at vastly different price points, but they are both roomy, seating five, and efficient hybrids with excellent EPA numbers. You'll be surprised that the pricier Crown doesn't beat the Camry in every category, so it's smart to take a deeper look. The top trim Camry and the base Crown are priced very close and outfitted similarly. Here’s how they stack up so you can choose with confidence.\n\nThe new-gen Camry is now hybrid across the board. It pairs a 2.5-liter four-cylinder with Toyota’s latest hybrid system and an e-CVT. Expect smooth, quiet acceleration in daily driving and enough passing punch for highway merges. Front-wheel drive is standard, and available all-wheel drive adds an electric motor to the rear axle for better traction in bad weather without the weight and complexity of a mechanical driveshaft. The Camry’s tuning prioritizes efficiency and calmness; it leans more “smart commuter” than “sport sedan,” though its stiffer platform and improved steering give it a more planted feel than past models. FWD models provide 225 horsepower; AWD gets 232. The sprint from 0-60 takes 6.8 seconds for the XSE AWD.\n\nThe Crown comes standard with a more robust AWD hybrid setup using a 2.5-liter engine and multiple electric motors for confident, all-weather performance. It’s quiet and unflustered, ideal for long highway slogs. Step up to the range-topping trim, and you can get Toyota’s Hybrid MAX powertrain, which pairs a turbocharged 2.4-liter engine with electric motors for notably stronger acceleration. In terms of performance, the Crown will hit 60 mph in 7.1 seconds, but the Hybrid MAX engine will launch it to 60 in a quick 5.7 seconds.\n\nThe 2025 Camry’s updated chassis tuning reduces road noise and body roll compared to earlier generations. It’s composed, predictable, and easy to place on a twisty road without ever turning harsh. While it might not seem very engaging to drive, it's better than the last generation and remarkably easy to helm for hours on end. Higher trims offer better sound insulation and slightly sportier calibration, but even base models feel mature.\n\nThe Crown goes a step further than the Camry in terms of ride comfort and cabin isolation. Its longer wheelbase, extra sound deadening, and available adaptive suspension on upper trims translate to a glide-like ride on broken pavement. The Crown is also taller with a raised seating position that's intentionally more like a crossover than a sedan. It improves outward visibility and makes ingress and egress easier. Around town, it soaks up bumps like a premium car, and on the highway, it’s quieter than the Camry.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid is the mileage champ. EPA estimates for the top trim XSE AWD (the closest trim to the Crown) are 44 city and 43 mpg highway. Lower trims net up to 51 mpg, a number that's Prius-level, a very impressive feat for a 5-passenger family sedan. With its lighter body and efficiency-first powertrain, it’s the Toyota sedan most buyers will choose to minimize fuel stops and maximize savings while providing practical room for five.\n\nThe Crown’s standard AWD and greater mass make it a bit less efficient, though still solid. XLE, Limited, and Nightshade models get an estimated 42 city and 41 highway. The Platinum trim has a lower estimate of 29 city and 32 highway. Opting for the Hybrid MAX brings real performance gains but trims mpg further. If your commute is long or fuel spend is a top priority, the Camry wins, but if you value comfort and speed enough to trade a few mpg, the Crown makes sense.\n\nThere's a lot to love about the Camry's interior. The combination of excellent tech and physical controls melds nicely with stylish elements that give it an air of refinement. The new interior emphasizes great switchgear for climate, audio, and shifting duties, as well as a clear digital instrument cluster, and a center screen that’s quick and intuitive. Front seats are supportive for longer drives, rear space is adult-friendly, and the trunk remains practical for family duty. It’s a smart, well-organized cabin with just enough style to feel current. Legroom is generous with 42.1 inches in front and 38 inches in back. SofTex cloth is available in black or grey, and leather on higher trims comes in black or red.\n\nMove up to the Crown, and you’ll notice thicker door panels, more soft-touch surfaces, richer seat upholstery, and a hushed cabin at speed. It's more like a Lexus than a Toyota inside, and the controls and infotainment bear premium hallmarks. The slightly taller floor and roofline create a commanding seating position that's not present on the Camry. Rear legroom is generous and the seats feel more lounge-like. If you frequently carry adult passengers, the Crown’s serenity and seating comfort are a notch higher. The downside is that no matter which trim level you choose, only black leather is available. In terms of space, the Toyota Crown has 42.1 inches of front legroom and 38.9 inches of rear legroom.\n\nToyota’s latest infotainment software appears in both, with responsive voice commands (“Hey Toyota”), over-the-air update capability, and the expected suite of connected services. Wireless phone mirroring and wireless charging are widely available, and higher trims bring larger screens and better audio.\n\nOn the safety front, both include Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 with adaptive cruise control, lane centering, automatic emergency braking, and traffic sign recognition. The Crown typically layers on more by default, such as 360-degree camera availability and additional convenience features, while the Camry lets you add many of the same items by climbing trims or packages. Either way, active safety coverage is strong, and both cars get high marks with the IIHS for crash safety; you simply can't go wrong here.\n\nThe Camry Hybrid is built to maximize value thanks to its lower base price, excellent efficiency, and a wide trim ladder so you can tailor features without overspending. Not just in terms of sales figures but overall well-roundedness, it's the right choice for most buyers. If you choose the loaded top trim Camry XSE with premium paint, all-wheel drive, and the Premium Plus Package, the price just about kisses the base price of the Crown. In terms of amenities, it’s now close to a tie. In terms of style, the Camry has more universal appeal, but it is ubiquitous.\n\nThe Crown starts higher and leans toward premium territory. Standard AWD, upscale materials, and a quieter ride justify the step up, especially if you spend a lot of time on the highway or just prefer a near-luxe experience without going full luxury brand. The Hybrid MAX version turns it into a stealth performance cruiser, but you’ll pay accordingly both at purchase and at the pump. When it comes to styling, the Crown looks more unique than the Camry, but its looks are also polarizing in certain colorways.\n\nBoth the 2026 Toyota Camry Hybrid and the 2026 Toyota Crown deliver the key Toyota virtues of efficiency, comfort, and long-term peace of mind. The Camry Hybrid is the smarter buy for most shoppers because it hits the bull’s-eye on value, fuel economy, and day-to-day usefulness. The Crown earns its keep if you spend lots of time on the road and want a calmer, more premium experience. It also offers the Hybrid MAX’s effortless powertrain, which the Camry doesn't have. Both are tremendous values in their own right, and it's hard to go wrong with either choice.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people involved in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church have been arrested, Trump administration officials said Thursday, even as a judge rebuffed related charges against journalist Don Lemon.\n\nVice President JD Vance, speaking in Minneapolis, urged state and local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials and said protesters must stop getting in their way.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.\n\nThe Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.\n\n“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.\n\nCities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads an ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.\n\nChurch lawyers praise the arrests\n\nProminent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.\n\nAttorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,” Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, said in a statement.\n\nThe St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.\n\nLevy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a “fundamental moral conflict.”\n\n“You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,” she said Tuesday. “When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renee Good’s, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.”\n\nVance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers\n\nState and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.\n\nVance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good’s death a “tragedy of her own making.”\n\nBefore his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: “Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"\n\nLater in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.\n\n“We’re doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,” Vance said, adding that he wants “state and local officials to meet us halfway.”\n\nGreg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.\n\nLevy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.\n\nPatel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.\n\nLevy Armstrong, Kelly and Allen have all been booked about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Minneapolis in Sherburne County Jail, where people in federal custody are usually held.\n\nA message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.\n\nSaint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.\n\nAllen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.\n\nKelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.\n\nIn court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.\n\nLevy Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.\n\n“They wanted a spectacle,” Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.\n\nArrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.\n\nAdministration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJudge rejects charges against Lemon\n\nA magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors’ bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong’s attorney.\n\nLemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.\n\n“Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,” Lemon said in a video posted on social media. “That’s it. That’s called journalism.”\n\nLemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge’s action confirms Lemon’s work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge’s decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.\n\nCNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n\nDurkin Richer reported from Washington. Associated Press reporters Chris Megerian in Washington; Corey Williams in Detroit; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.",

That is the question many people ask before a cholesterol test.\n\nPatients used to be routinely instructed not to eat for at least eight hours before the screening, and some doctors still recommend that practice.\n\nBut fasting before lipid test is unnecessary for most people since the impact on cholesterol numbers is usually “negligible,” according to the Harvard Medical School.\n\nDr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, has stopped asking his patients to fast before a cholesterol test.\n\n“You want to see what your numbers look like when you're living every day, not in some artificial state,” he tells TODAY.com.\n\nBut there’s one type of food the cardiologist recommends avoiding before the blood test.\n\n“The truth is, the only real parameter on the lipid panel that changes drastically and quickly is triglycerides,” Freeman says.\n\n“So I'd recommend that you not eat sweets and treats before you go for your lipid panel to avoid that spike in triglycerides.”\n\nBesides sugary foods and beverages, triglycerides are also dependent on white carbs, fatty foods and alcohol so the cardiologist would also avoid those foods and drinks immediately before his lipid panel.\n\nTriglycerides are the most common type of fat in the body, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\n\nSome are needed for good health, but high levels of triglycerides can raise the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nA healthy level of triglycerides is below 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for adults.\n\nBut about a quarter of Americans have levels that are too high. Those patients should always fast before a cholesterol test to get a more accurate measure of their triglycerides, experts at the Harvard Medical School note. That’s also how Freeman approaches lipid testing in his office.\n\nOther than skipping sweets and treats, most people can eat what they normally eat the night before a cholesterol test, Freeman says.\n\n“If you decide to eat nothing but kale for two weeks prior to your lipid panel, your triglycerides will probably be really low, and maybe your LDL could be a little lower,” he notes.\n\n“(But) your goal is to try to catch what you're like in the wild, in the real world.”\n\nHopefully, that includes lots of heart-healthy foods.\n\nAlways check with your doctor to see if you need to fast before a cholesterol test.\n\nTODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier. Every Monday through Friday, different qualified experts share their best advice on diet, fitness, heart health, mental wellness and more.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com",

    "title": "ICE Agents Detained Me for Eight Hours for Legally Observing Them. I Saw Exactly What They’re Up To.",
    "description": "We didn’t understand why we were being taken in—until we did.",
    "fullText": "This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.\n\nAs masked men dressed for war surrounded the car my friend Patty and I sat in, all I could think about were the moments that had led to my neighbor Renee Good’s death. “I’m not mad at you,” she had told her killer. These agents, who I had to assume were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (they never identified themselves), were already banging on our windows and recording us. Then they pepper-sprayed the intake vent of the car. They were definitely mad at us.\n\n“You’re under arrest!” the agents yelled. Terrified, I thrust my hands in the air and waited for instruction. They did not give me any—instead, they shattered our windows and pulled me out. I was roughly handcuffed and shoved into the back of an unmarked Subaru.\n\nI was a recent volunteer to the neighborhood group that had organized to observe and report ICE after Operation Metro Surge began here in Minnesota weeks ago. The efforts had only increased since Good’s killing. In community chats, suspected ICE sightings are reported, their license plates checked against a constantly updated public spreadsheet. If they are confirmed, people in cars drive to the scene to record what the agents are doing and warn people that ICE is in the area with car horns and whistles. Recording, a legally protected action, occurs on public streets.\n\nMost of the time, commuting (as it’s known in activist circles) is boring. You typically drive in circles around familiar streets. Volunteer dispatchers will help coordinate where people should go, but usually they just recommend sticking around areas with lots of brown people: restaurants, community centers, the kinds of places that make Minneapolis vital. Commuting has become so popular as of late that it’s common to hear a dispatcher request that listeners “please leave the call if you are not actively commuting.” Signal calls have limited space.\n\nOccasionally, though, commuting is terrifying. “Have y’all not learned?” an agent provocatively asks a legal observer in a video that’s been circulating among volunteers, two days after Good was killed. Her response, “What’s our lesson here?,” angers him, and he tries to snatch her phone. Agents have also been known to follow commuters to their homes to intimidate them, which means “He’s following me to my house” has become another common refrain on the Signal chat. One time, I suggested that a woman on a call drive to a nearby gas station to meet me because an ICE vehicle was idling outside her home and she was audibly terrified.\n\nI ended up in ICE custody shortly after beginning a commute on Jan. 11. Someone in our neighborhood chat had reported that ICE vehicles were pepper-spraying an observer. Patty and I, not far away, drove there. I was keenly aware of Good’s death when we arrived on the scene—it had been just four days and was a six-minute drive from where she was killed. This was the first time I had ever seen ICE agents in my life (I wasn’t joking when I said some commuter shifts are boring), and that’s when they pepper-sprayed the interior of our car and hauled us out of it. By the time the agents shoved me into that unmarked SUV, three minutes and 30 seconds had elapsed. We didn’t understand why we were being taken in: We hadn’t blocked their cars or done anything beyond routine observing.\n\nPatty, separated from me, was subject to humiliation on her drive in. They called her ugly, took pictures of her, and referred to Renee Good as “that lesbian bitch.” They took us both to the Whipple Federal Building, a place where, the day before, three local lawmakers had been denied access. They had been trying to ascertain the conditions within. As I was being processed, shackled, and led into a cell, I wondered if I would be able to report to the outside world what it was like in there.\n\nIn a bare yellow cell, I tried to sleep, but when I closed my eyes, I could hear screaming and crying from deeper inside the facility. My requests to use the bathroom or to drink water were routinely ignored, met only after I banged on the one-way glass in my cell and begged agents directly.\n\nI saw other detainees only when I was finally able to go to the bathroom—presumably, they were the other people that ICE was here to hunt. The looks on their faces horrified me. Through observation glass, I saw more than a dozen people crammed into a cell, seemingly lacking energy. They stared at the ground or at the wall. They didn’t talk to one another. One man pushed his face up against the one-way glass, either trying to see out or just desperate for any kind of stimulation.\n\nElsewhere, I saw a woman, through an observation glass, using the bathroom. She wore a garment to preserve her modesty, but that could not protect her from three leering agents who stood watching her, making small talk and laughing. She cried on the toilet.\n\nI was lucky—after the eight hours I spent in custody, I was released with no charges. It helped that I had a lawyer, Emanual Williams, whom my family contacted as they tried to piece together what had happened to me.\n\nAfter I got out, I called Williams to thank him. I asked him if it was difficult to come speak with me. Legal counsel is supposed to always be allowed in the building, even when it’s closed. He told me that things are changing at Whipple. “We’ve started to see a process that’s more dangerous towards U.S. citizens being detained, receiving charges, and being transported to federal jails,” he said.\n\nOften, whether someone in custody gets to see their lawyer simply depends on who is working that day. “Some people at the door have said it’s not possible to see someone unless someone has retained us,” Williams said. “One time, I drove up to the guard post outside of the Whipple building, and they told me it was closed. One of the postmen—I think they were part of the police team—approached my vehicle with pepper spray.”\n\nA video of the arrest of my cellmate, a legal resident named Dennis, shows his body being bent forward into an unmarked van as two agents try to force him in. Dennis’ face is placid. A third agent, trying to be helpful, gropes for pepper spray on his tactical vest.\n\n“Do you want me to spray you?” he demands, thrusting it an inch from Dennis’ eye.\n\n“Don’t spray him, don’t fucking spray him,” the agent in the front of the car scolds his partner, swatting the pepper spray away from Dennis’ face.\n\n“I told him, ‘Go ahead,’ ” Dennis had said to me in our cell, laughing.\n\nPatty and I weren’t the only ones detained for trying to alert people to ICE’s presence and filming agents. We’ve since met four others who had similar experiences. I was never charged with a crime; I now assume that my detention was meant to stop me from recording ICE officers.\n\nThe effort to intimidate observers continues, but they haven’t been discouraged. Minneapolis is so organized in its observer responses that increasingly, the agency has spread its activities to the surrounding area, where there aren’t as many residents mobilized, alerted to their presence, and filming them. ICE officers don’t want people to see what they’re doing, which is why it’s more important than ever to document it. My arresting agent stole my whistle. After I got out, I bought a pack of 24 more.",

    "description": "\"We were able to get firsthand exposure to a lot of real-world scenarios.\"",
    "fullText": "A team from General Motors drove two of its pre-production electric vehicles on an epic roadtrip, collecting real-world data and even helping to solve an annoying charging snafu along the way.\n\nThe company documented the 5,000-mile-long road trip that put the Cadillac OPTIQ luxury crossover and a GMC Sierra EV pickup truck to the test. During the drive, three GM engineers gathered data on its hands-free driver assistance system, EV charging, and real-time range prediction while towing a trailer.\n\n\"We were able to get firsthand exposure to a lot of real-world scenarios, from trailering features and GPS navigation updates to Super Cruise behavior in unusual situations,\" quality engineering manager Tony Kraatz said.\n\n​​GM noted that both vehicles were equipped with advanced monitoring gear that helped the team \"find the root cause of a frustrating problem\": slow performance at one public fast-charging system. Ultimately, they discovered that the charger's software code had a typo that was slowing it down. They contacted the operator, who promptly fixed the issue.\n\nThis kind of extreme real-world testing helps improve overall performance for electric vehicles, which should be a win for greater EV adoption. According to the Department of Energy, driving an EV can help slash fuel costs, though it adds that initial costs for EVs can be greater than those of combustion engine vehicles.\n\nStill, many states offer rebates or tax credits that help offset this. For instance, New Mexico gives residents a $3,000 state tax credit when they purchase a new EV.\n\nEV users can save even more money — and avoid annoying malfunctions like the one described by GM — by charging at home instead of using public chargers. If you're interested in exploring home-charging options, Qmerit can help get you started with a Level 2 charger system. The company offers free installation estimates, too.\n\nIf you're ready for even more savings, using solar to power your home can help reduce charging costs even further. TCD's Solar Explorer has all sorts of resources and can link you up with trusted partners that could help save up to $10,000 on installation costs.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "What is Nipah virus? Symptoms to watch out for as India races to contain deadly outbreak",
    "description": "Nipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization",
    "fullText": "India is moving quickly to contain a Nipah virus outbreak in the eastern state of West Bengal after five cases were confirmed, including doctors and nurses who were infected.\n\nNearly 100 people have been asked to quarantine at home, and infected patients were being treated in hospitals in and around the capital Kolkata, according to local media reports, with one patient in a critical condition.\n\nNipah is a deadly virus with no vaccine or cure and is considered a high-risk pathogen by the World Health Organization. Experts say human infections are rare and usually occur when the virus spills over from bats, often through contaminated fruit.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this virus:\n\nNipah virus (NiV) infection most often begins with non-specific symptoms, making early detection difficult.\n\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation period is generally believed to range from four to 21 days, though longer delays between exposure and illness have been reported in rare cases during previous outbreaks.\n\nPatients typically develop a sudden flu-like illness marked by fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. In some cases, respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia also occur, although the timing and severity of these symptoms can vary widely.\n\nThe most serious and defining complication of Nipah infection is inflammation of the brain, known as encephalitis. Neurological symptoms, including confusion, altered consciousness, seizures or coma, usually appear several days to weeks after the initial onset of illness.\n\nSome patients may also develop meningitis.\n\nNipah virus is associated with a high death rate, with fatality levels reported between 40 and 75 per cent depending on the outbreak and the viral strain involved.\n\nSurvivors may experience long-term neurological effects, such as persistent seizures or changes in personality, according to the UK Health Security Agency’s update.\n\nIn rare cases, encephalitis has been reported to recur months or even years after the initial infection, either due to relapse or reactivation of the virus.\n\nNipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans and from person to person, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe primary natural carriers are fruit bats (Pteropus species); humans can become infected through direct contact with infected bats or other animals, or by consuming food contaminated with bat saliva, urine or faeces.\n\nHuman‑to‑human transmission has also been reported, particularly through close contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nNipah virus (NiV) was first identified in 1999 after an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness among pig farmers and others who had close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. The episode led to the recognition of NiV as a serious zoonotic pathogen capable of crossing from animals to humans.\n\nSince then, repeated outbreaks have been recorded in South Asia. Parts of northeast India and several districts in Bangladesh have reported cases, with Bangladesh experiencing outbreaks almost every year since 2001.\n\nIn southern India, the state of Kerala reported its first Nipah outbreak in 2018, followed by sporadic cases in subsequent years.\n\nBeyond South Asia, infections have also been reported in the Philippines, with investigations suggesting they were caused by the Nipah virus or a closely related Nipah-like strain.\n\nScientific studies have identified fruit bats as the natural reservoir of the virus. Nipah virus has been isolated from bat urine in Malaysia, and antibodies have been detected in at least 23 bat species across Asia as well as in parts of Africa, including Ghana and Madagascar.\n\nDespite this wide animal reservoir, confirmed human outbreaks have so far been limited to South and Southeast Asia, typically occurring in rural or semi-rural settings where contact between humans, bats and domestic animals is more likely, WHO says.\n\n“Human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and caregivers of infected patients,” according to WHO.\n\nThere is currently no proven, targeted treatment for Nipah virus (NiV) infection and no approved vaccine to prevent it.\n\nCare for patients remains largely supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and complications as they arise.\n\nThe virus is listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen under its Research and Development Blueprint, which identifies epidemic threats that require urgent research.\n\nFollow these essential precautions to prevent Nipah Virus infection. Stay alert, stay informed, and follow advisories issued by local health authorities.#NipahVirus #PublicHealth #HealthForAll pic.twitter.com/itTuZA18ev\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 22, 2026\n\nWith no vaccine available, preventing Nipah virus infection relies on awareness and simple protective measures, global health agencies recommend. Public health advice focuses on reducing contact with the virus, whether from bats, animals, or infected people.\n\nPreventing bat-to-human transmission: Bats are the main carriers of Nipah. People should avoid consuming raw date palm sap or fruits that might have been contaminated by bats, WHO guidelines advise.\n\nBoiling fresh date palm juice and thoroughly washing or peeling fruits can reduce risk. Any fruit showing signs of bat bites should be discarded, the health agency advises.\n\nPreventing animal-to-human transmission: People handling sick animals, their tissues, or during slaughter should wear gloves and protective clothing. Contact with infected pigs should be minimised, and pig farms in areas with fruit bats should take steps to protect feed and enclosures from bats.\n\nSymptoms of Nipah Virus in humans can range from fever and headache to respiratory distress and neurological complications.\nEarly recognition of these symptoms and timely medical care are critical to reducing severity and preventing complications.#NipahVirus #HealthAwareness… pic.twitter.com/odW9baGomD\n\n— Ministry of Health (@MoHFW_INDIA) January 20, 2026\n\nPreventing human-to-human transmission: Avoid close, unprotected contact with people infected with Nipah. Regular hand washing after caring for or visiting sick individuals is essential to stop the virus from spreading.\n\nThe 2011 film Contagion, which depicts a fast-spreading global virus, was partly inspired by real-life pathogens like the Nipah virus, a bat-borne virus first identified in Malaysia in 1999, according to global health non-profit Path’s website.\n\nNipah causes severe respiratory illness and brain inflammation (encephalitis) and can spread from animals to humans, contaminated food, or infected people.\n\nIts high fatality rate, potential for outbreaks, and lack of a vaccine made it a model for how a zoonotic virus could trigger a pandemic, which filmmakers used to shape the realistic global crisis in Contagion, Path noted.",

    "description": "Musk said the subscription price, currently $99, will rise as the FSD's capabilities improve over time.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk said Tesla will raise subscription prices for its Full Self-Driving software as it gets better, and it could cost more than $100.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said in an early Friday X post, \"I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD's capabilities improve.\"\n\n\"The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD),\" he said.\n\nTesla's FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that aims to enable its cars to be fully self-driving.\n\nCustomers can currently buy the system for $8,000 on a one-time basis, per the vehicle's listing on Tesla's website. However, this option will no longer be available from February 14.\n\nThe executive was responding to a post about Tesla killing its separate Autopilot service in the US.\n\nMost of Tesla's vehicles previously came with Autopilot as standard. The software included traffic-aware cruise control, which maintains a set driving speed and slows down automatically in response to traffic, as well as features like Autosteer, which allowed Tesla's cars to automatically follow lane markings.\n\nAs of Friday, Tesla now only offers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control as standard, according to the company's website.\n\nThe move attracted backlash from some Tesla fans on X, with several pointing out that rival brands like Toyota offer lane centering technology as standard on many models.\n\nIt comes as Tesla pushes to drive subscriptions for FSD, which Musk has described as a critical part of the company's future.\n\nAdoption of the technology has been sluggish, with Tesla's CFO telling investors in October that only around 12% of Tesla owners are paying for the assisted-driving feature.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a crucial part of Musk's massive Tesla pay package. Getting to 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions is one of the key milestones the Tesla CEO needs to hit to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nTesla currently makes it clear that FSD requires driver supervision. The company announced Thursday that it had begun offering fully autonomous rides without a safety monitor in its robotaxi service in Austin, and Musk has said that he expects \"unsupervised\" FSD to massively boost demand for Tesla's vehicles.\n\nThe automaker has faced regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits over its rollout of FSD and Autopilot. The US's auto regulator launched an investigation in October following reports that Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD were running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Business Insider tested Tesla's Full Self-Driving system and found it a highly capable driver assistance feature. Full autonomy will be a game changer.",
    "fullText": "Two things can be true of Tesla's Full Self-Driving: It's an impressive piece of technology, and it still doesn't go far enough.\n\nFSD is Tesla's big bet. CEO Elon Musk and his most bullish investors believe that autonomy will help take Tesla's valuation to new heights.\n\nToday, FSD (Supervised), as the name suggests, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that requires constant human supervision. The promise is to advance FSD enough to make the system unsupervised — meaning the driver behind the wheel can take their eyes off the road or even fall asleep. Tesla gave a glimpse of this future on Thursday, launching Robotaxi rides in Austin without a safety monitor in the vehicle.\n\nThe gap between what the tech can do and what it can't is where my experience landed.\n\nI recently demoed a 2025 Tesla Model 3 that came installed with FSD v14.2.1, the latest software version available at the time.\n\nWith my friend riding shotgun, I drove around the East Bay Area, taking the Model 3 through various road environments, including a university campus, parking lots, and the highway, on a clear Saturday afternoon.\n\nFSD proved to be a highly capable driver — so much so that it has spoiled me into wishing that I didn't have to constantly babysit the system.\n\nI drove the Model 3 for a few hours around Berkeley and Alameda. The drive was a little less than 100 miles through a wide range of driving conditions — highly dense urban streets, university roads, canyons, and the highway.\n\nOne was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.\n\nThe system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.\n\nFSD's \"Mad Max\" mode is impressive in the way it lane-changed around a few cars that were moving too slowly on the highway for my taste. Calling it \"Mad Max\" feels a little gratuitous, but I appreciate that a more urgent driving mode is available.\n\nAt no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. Tesla FSD is a smooth and cautious driver.\n\nMy friend, who doesn't actively follow tech news or everything Musk says as much as I do, described the experience like being in a \"spaceship.\" That wasn't necessarily a compliment from his end — he likes older cars — but it's exactly how Musk intended the Tesla experience to be.\n\nI gained enough trust in FSD that I wanted to test the system's limits by closing my eyes while driving down University Avenue — a fairly busy thoroughfare in Berkeley.\n\nThe car kept driving for a bit, but I was inevitably warned to pay attention to the road.\n\nAs good as FSD is, the technology doesn't allow you to completely disengage mentally. It was like having an itch that's just not quite fully satisfied. The technology is — or at least feels — so, so close.\n\nPeople who swear by FSD like to say that the system is a game changer, lifting the burden of driving off their shoulders.\n\nI agree that driving can be a tedious chore. I immediately think about the drive between San Francisco and Los Angeles that I do a few times a year. It's about 400 miles and can easily be a 7-hour drive depending on traffic.\n\nThe problem isn't that it's hard in a problem-solving sense. The drive is mostly a straight shot. The problem is that I have to stay awake. I can listen to music, put on an entertaining podcast, or get 200 mg of caffeine from a can of Celsius, but the drive is so monotonous that I could easily doze off while on the 5 highway.\n\nI obviously can't do that yet with Tesla FSD, which makes me wonder: How significant is the difference, really, between the cognitive effort it takes to manually drive from SF to LA than having to supervise an ADAS?\n\nFSD feels like the burden of driving was just shifted away from my hands and feet to my attention.\n\nMusk said an FSD (Supervised) is now capable enough for drivers to take their eyes off the road in certain conditions without triggering the warning system.\n\nThat would be useful only if Tesla were to take full responsibility when I get pulled over by the police.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nI'm likely spoiled because I know what full autonomy feels like.\n\nI have constant access to Waymo. I've filed an entire story inside a robotaxi and used it several times to take me home after a night of drinking.\n\nThat's the bar I want Tesla FSD to reach and exceed: a system capable enough to let me sleep behind the wheel on any road, meaning no geofences, and one in which Tesla will take accountability for any issues that arise while FSD is unsupervised.\n\nI'm also thinking about folks like David Moss, who said he broke a record for driving more than 11,000 miles on FSD without touching the steering wheel. Moss told me how FSD could be a life-changer for his father, who is legally blind and unable to drive. If Tesla's ADAS can reliably — and legally — put people like Moss' dad behind the wheel, I can see Full Self-Driving going from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have.\n\nTesla's decision to remove the safety monitor from some of its robotaxis suggests the company could be close.",

    "description": "Fed up with exclusive restaurants, young diners are regularmaxxing",
    "fullText": "Clara Greenstein, a 28-year-old who lives in Queens, New York, can be found several nights a week at her local bar, The Seneca. The spot serves good burgers and drinks for a good price, but the main draw is a pool table. Greenstein entered a tournament about two years ago, and now she's inherited the role of running it. \"I get a free hamburger every week and get to basically have office hours for all my friends,\" she tells me. On a night when she's got nothing to do, she'll pop in after work and end up \"just sitting at the bar like it's 1995\" after her tech job, rather than bingeing shows or doom scrolling. \"I've never gone there and not seen a familiar face.\"\n\nExhausted from years of chasing exclusive reservations and trendy foods from viral videos and ordering app deliveries from ghost kitchens, young adults in America are now looking closer to home for something you can't promote on Instagram and TikTok: their own version of Central Perk or Cheers. These local bars, restaurants, and coffee shops where everybody knows your name are most notable for what they mean to their regulars more than what they're selling to anyone outside of the neighborhood. One person on X described going to the same cafe and tipping generously as \"regularmaxxing,\" saying it had \"changed my life.\"\n\nTech companies are looking to capitalize on the hunger for regularity, too.\n\n\"The connectivity between restaurants and guests has in many ways broken down in the technology age,\" says Ben Leventhal, cofounder of restaurant reservation app Resy, who in 2022 started Blackbird, an app focused on loyalty rewards for restaurants in a handful of US cities, including New York and Los Angeles. \"Restaurants love to connect with new regulars, guests love to become regulars.\"\n\nJust over half of Americans say they consider themselves a regular at a local restaurant or bar, according to data from OpenTable. That means they go there three or four times a month, and the staff might know their name or their order. Gen Z is less likely than Millennials and Gen X to say they have such a spot. But the restaurant business is relentless. Hype cycles around new openings spur demand, but many close. Empty tables are a major concern for restaurants, and using online reservation platforms to fill seats became highly desirable. A 2025 report from the National Restaurant Association found that fast casual, quick service, and coffee shops were likely to have loyalty programs, but even 20% of fine dining and 41% of casual sit-down restaurants also said they have rewards. A majority of those who had such programs said they believed they had led to increased customer traffic.\n\nBig chains bolstered their loyalty programs with apps in the 2010s — earn free drinks at Starbucks, get extra points for placing your Dunkin' order to go. Many loyalty programs gobbled up customer data in exchange for free treats, and some have left customers with diminishing returns, sometimes also cutting out the entirety of the barista-customer interaction with apps (Starbucks, for one, recently encouraged baristas to adorn to-go cups with hand-written messages to build rapport with guests). When it comes to internet, cell phone bills, and credit cards, customer loyalty isn't always rewarded; the services often creep up in cost over time.\n\nNow tech companies are focusing on bringing perks to diners who aren't only opting for big chain restaurants. There's Dorsia, which allows subscribers to book tables at the most exclusive restaurants, and some American Express cardholders get the privilege of grabbing reservations on Resy that are sometimes blocked from public view. But there's growing interest in not just getting people into the most desired seats, but to make them regular diners at regular spots, and facilitating the exchange of customer data for perks and a better experience. The Blackbird app offers crypto-based reward perks for spending at restaurants in the app's network. \"We're focusing on rewarding loyalty, motivating people to be loyal to places that they love,\" Leventhal says. The driving idea is that people can use the app to reserve a table and pay — all while the app tells the restaurant who you are and what you like — say, if you typically eat a certain type of cuisine, and your location, but it's also testing a feature where restaurants receive a short summary about patrons that can include their average tip amount. Money spent via the Blackbird app increased by 1,000% in 2025, and there are now more than 1,000 restaurants partnered with Blackbird. \"And hopefully in doing so, we are creating essentially the next version of the restaurant economy, where guests and restaurants are closely connected and restaurants have the tools to find and cultivate new regulars.\" There's Bilt, the rent rewards platform that highlights some 20,000 partnered restaurants across the country, and offers up to six times on points for people who throw down their Bilt Mastercards at the spots. \"What we're building goes beyond the four walls of your apartment; we're connecting you with your entire neighborhood and making every aspect of where you live more rewarding,\" Ken Chenault, chairman of Bilt, said in a statement last summer that also announced that Bilt's valuation has surpassed $10 billion.\n\nSmaller businesses are also starting their own loyalty programs and building fan bases. At Talea, a New York City brewery that has five locations, customers can There are discounts to earn and exclusive \"insider only\" events to attend. It's a move that's more sophisticated than bringing a punch card to your local barista to get a 10th coffee for free. Tara Hankinson, co-founder of Talea, says the brewery wants \"to offer a great value to the people who spend a lot of time and money and make memories with us.\" That means \"unique experiences, unique access behind the scenes, and really bringing people together to celebrate.\"\n\nBut many of the best connections aren't those facilitated by an app or a formal program, and come as people seek out that homey, regular \"Friends\" feeling. Lynne Miller, a 35-year-old who lives in Ontario and works in marketing, says she set a goal for herself last year to become a regular somewhere. It ended up being Holly's Neighbourhood Cafe & Bar, where she sits in the same seat each week to work for a few hours at the same time on Thursday mornings (it's blocked off on her calendar, so she's fully committed). Miller has gotten to know other coffee lovers, the baristas, and the owner. \"It's not for the 'Gram,\" Miller says. \"It's because you actually crave a real-life community experience and connection.\"\n\nAllison Memmo is a regular at her local Philadelphia brewery, Humble Parlor. Last year, she watched dozens of Phillies games there, competing in a fan competition in which the brewery gives a stamp to patrons for every game they stop in during a baseball game. Her dog, Starling, even became a regular with a stamp card. For Memmo, a 34-year-old editor, the competition to watch the most games became even more serious when she and her top opponent started dating. The two became a couple and ultimately tied for first place. Their prize: bricks on the wall bearing their names, and a special day when all their friends at the brewery will come together to celebrate them. Memmo has had a regular neighborhood bar before, but says this is the first time she's gotten so close with the owners and customers. \"Everyone is actually friends,\" she tells me.\n\nA pre-pandemic trend favored introversion, canceling plans as self-care, and staying in to binge watch TV. Now, more people see that having a village means showing up, and showing up repeatedly. Becoming a regular takes quieter, repeated work, and the rewards are often subtle. Payton Tysinger, a 26-year-old who moved from Miami to Boston last year, has made it a goal to \"build community through the mundane actions of life.\" He goes to the same coffee shop when he commutes to his office for his marketing job, the same bakery on the weekends, and is trying to become a regular at bar trivia. \"It's an opportunity in this non-digital, analog renaissance to centralize living, and I don't mean living in the sense of like, slay, live, let's go take this trip to Ibiza or whatever,\" he says. \"I mean living in the sense of the nitty gritty of being a human being.\"\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "title": "From potential Treasury Secretary to a $5 billion lawsuit: Trump and Jamie Dimon's on-again, off-again relationship",
    "description": "The relationship between President Donald Trump and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has oscillated between public barbs and admissions of respect.",
    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon is known for saying what he thinks. At Davos, the JPMorgan CEO was uncharacteristically constrained when talking about Donald Trump and his policies, striking a cautious balance between criticism and praise. \n\nThis is a familiar dance in a relationship that has swung between mutual respect and open hostility since Trump first took office in 2016.\n\nDimon, who once described himself as \"barely a Democrat,\" has publicly criticized some of Trump's economic and political policies, including on tariffs, while also praising his deregulatory moves and efforts to grow the economy.\n\n\"He was kind of right about NATO. Kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China,\" Dimon said in Davos in 2024, while in the same breath saying he didn't like some of Trump's rhetoric.\n\nNow that Trump has filed suit against Dimon and JPMorgan for $5 billion over claims of politically-motivated debanking, here's a look at their relationship over the years.\n\nAlthough he financially supported Hillary Clinton's 2008 run for office, Dimon didn't publicly endorse a candidate that year, in 2012, or in 2016. He said in a memo following Trump's victory that his win reflected a \"deep desire for change\" across the country.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO sat on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that first met in February of 2017 and focused on how government policies affected economic growth. After Trump's inflammatory response to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, members of the council, including Dimon, decided to disband the group.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump announced that he was disbanding the group in a post on then-Twitter.\n\nTrump said in the recent lawsuit that JPMorgan told him in February 2021 that it was closing his accounts, along with accounts of some of his family's businesses. Trump, along with some other conservatives, has criticized perceived politically motivated \"debanking\" in recent months, claiming that JPMorgan and other banks have shut down the accounts of conservatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 Republican primaries, Dimon openly praised former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and advised Democrats to support her if they didn't want to face Trump again.\n\n\"Even if you're a very liberal Democrat, I urge you, help Nikki Haley, too,\" he said at the DealBook Summit. \"Get a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump.\"\n\nDimon also said he was ready to work with Trump again, should he win reelection.\n\nThe banker's call for supporting Haley drew Trump's ire, with the then-former president calling Dimon a \"highly overrated globalist\" in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's tone on Dimon changed during a 2024 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, in which he said he had \"a lot of respect\" for the JPMorgan CEO.\n\n\"He is somebody that I would consider, sure,\" he added when asked if Dimon could be his next Treasury Secretary.\n\nTrump ramped up pressure on Dimon in the lead-up to the 2024 election, posting on Truth Social that Dimon had endorsed him.\n\nDimon denied he'd endorsed Trump through a JPMorgan spokesperson.\n\nThe pair's public relationship grew tense again in the summer of 2025, after Trump signed an executive order for federal banking regulators to eliminate guidance that encourages what he calls \"politicized\" or \"unlawful\" debanking.\n\nTrump told CNBC that JPMorgan and Bank of America had refused to accept his deposits, saying that the financial institutions \"discriminate against many conservatives.\"\n\nTrump's claims of discrimination gave way to his $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan and its CEO. The bank denies any wrongdoing related to the closure of Trump's accounts, saying that account closures are sometimes required \"because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\"\n\n\"We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,\" reads a January statement from JPMorgan.\n\nHowever, the suit isn't the only recent point of tension between Trump and Dimon. Dimon has become more outspoken in his opposition to some of Trump's latest economic policies, including lambasting Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest as an \"economic disaster.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans.\n\nIn a January interview with the Chamber of Commerce, Dimon also reiterated his belief in the Fed's independence, which has come into question in recent days amid the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\nDimon said there was \"absolutely, positively, no chance, no way, no how for any reason\" that he would serve as Fed Chair, but he did say he would \"consider\" the job of Treasury Secretary — if it was offered.\n\nHe'd need to understand \"what they want and how they want to operate\" before making a decision, Dimon said.",

The tech giant received wide praise across the industry for the capabilities of its Gemini 3 AI model, which some observers said had surpassed ChatGPT.\n\nWhile declining to detail what he described as OpenAI's missteps, Tworek said that the pioneering AI company should never have lost the lead it established with the release of ChatGPT in 2022.\n\n\"If you are a company that is ahead and has all the advantages that OpenAI has you should always stay ahead,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Tworek said, \"Google did a lot of things right.\"\n\n\"Very clearly, Google started treating seriously at that moment, training large language models and, like, through OpenAI fumbling its lead, they are very, very close now in capability and in terms of models trained,\" he said, adding that the whole industry began to up its investment in AI when OpenAI showed ChatGPT could generate revenue.\n\nAs for OpenAI, Tworek said that the sheer toll of the AI race has led the non-profit-research lab-turned-public-benefit-corporation to place less of an emphasis on risky research that may not yield results. A spokesperson for OpenAI did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"There are multiple aspects of certain things that are just hard to do in a company that has to compete in an extremely, extremely brutal and demanding race for having the best AI model in the world right now,\" he said. \"One dynamic is there is naturally how much willingness of risks companies are willing to take from the perspective of trying to not fall behind.\"\n\nTworek said \"all major AI companies\" are facing pressure to show user growth and pay for GPUs while simultaneously competing to be the best available model.\n\n\"That does affect somehow your appetite for risk that you are willing to take,\" he said.\n\nDo you work at OpenAI or Google?

    "description": "The early winners of the legal tech boom are gobbling up smaller competitors.",
    "fullText": "Legal tech is entering its consolidation era.\n\nEarly signs are already visible. This week, Harvey, an $8 billion legal software giant, acquired Hexus, a sales tech startup built by former Google and Twitter (now X) engineers. Filevine, another major legal tech player, recently snapped up Pincites, a four-person startup that was an early Y Combinator bet on what has since become one of legal tech's hottest frontiers: artificial intelligence-powered contract drafting and revision.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Microsoft quietly absorbed 18 employees from the legal software startup Robin AI after it filed for bankruptcy.\n\nIndustry executives say this is just the beginning. Early winners of the legal tech boom are expected to buy smaller companies to extend their leads and add new features to their software.\n\nFor teams in a crowded legal tech market, joining one of those platforms is increasingly attractive, said John Locke, a Filevine investor and partner at Accel, who leads the firm's growth fund. He believes Harvey and Filevine could both be significant public companies someday.\n\n\"They're now at a point where people look at them and say, 'I would like to join that fast train,'\" Locke said.\n\nPincites wasn't looking for an exit.\n\nThe company was founded in 2023 by two sisters working from home. Sona Sulakian was a transactional patent attorney. Mariam Sulakian worked on GitHub Copilot, focusing on security. They saw a gap: Lawyers negotiate contracts inside Microsoft Word, but most AI tools lived elsewhere.\n\nThey built a Word plug-in lawyers actually used, and racked up customers including Redis, Glean, and Vercel. In 2023, Pincites raised a seed round led by Nat Friedman, GitHub's former CEO, and Daniel Gross, who, with Friedman, now works in Meta's superintelligence lab.\n\nInvestors encouraged the sisters to raise another round of funding. Then the inbound acquisition interest started.\n\nAt one point, there were at least five or six term sheets on the table, Ryan Anderson, Filevine's founder and CEO, said. The sisters initially waved them off.\n\nWhat changed, both sides said, was familiarity. Filevine had already been a customer. Its internal legal team used the Pincites software for contract redlining — the process of marking up and revising contract drafts during negotiations — and pushed Anderson to take a closer look.\n\nFounded in 2014, the Utah company now manages over 13 million active legal matters on the platform and sells software used by law firms, corporate legal teams, and government agencies. Its customers include Kroger, Goodwill, the Utah Jazz, and five state attorneys general.\n\nFilevine has raised over $600 million in funding to date and was last valued at $3 billion.\n\nWhat the company lacked was a next-generation redlining tool.\n\nSome competitors, Anderson noted, promote redlining as a core feature. To compete for enterprise and mid-market deals, Filevine needed a comparable offering.\n\nThe entire Pincites team is joining Filevine and will anchor a new San Francisco office. Over time, the product will be folded into Filevine's system, creating what Anderson calls \"a single pane of glass\" where users can draft and edit documents, pull in context from other systems, and track time and billing.\n\nFor the Sulakian sisters, the decision came down to distribution. Pincites had more ideas than it had capacity to execute, they said, and expanding its customer base fast enough to capture the market would have required years of additional fundraising and hiring. Joining a larger platform offered a shortcut.\n\nPincites didn't sell because it was distressed, Mariam said. \"We would have been fine no matter what.\" It sold because the market is maturing.\n\nAfter years of experimenting with narrow, single-purpose tools, law firms and in-house legal teams are looking to simplify, Sona said. Managing a patchwork of apps became costly and unwieldy, particularly for smaller firms.\n\nThat pressure is now driving a \"shakeout of point solutions,\" said Omar Haroun, cofounder and chief executive of the legal tech company Eudia.\n\n\"The winners will be platforms embedded in daily legal workflows and tied to outcomes,\" Haroun said. \"The rest will be acquired, merged, or phased out.\"\n\nThat dynamic mirrors what played out during the rise of mobile software. Smartphones unleashed a wave of narrowly focused apps, made possible by cheap development and easy distribution. But as platforms matured, users tired of app sprawl, and the biggest companies began bundling features or buying competitors outright. Facebook acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. Google bought Waze.\n\nLegal tech now appears to be entering a similar phase, as large language models lower the barrier to building these tools — and raise the bar for surviving as a standalone company.\n\nOver $4 billion flowed into startups building technology for lawyers last year, nearly double the amount raised the year before, according to Crunchbase. More than a third of last year's investment went to just three companies: Harvey, Filevine, and Clio, which sells software used by law firms to track cases and send invoices.\n\nLast year, Clio scooped up the legal research platform vLex for $1 billion, part of its push to become the system of record for small and midsize firms.\n\nWith that concentration of capital comes pressure. The biggest players have to deploy it. And smaller startups have to prove they can hold their own. For some builders, the choice may increasingly be to sell — before the window narrows further.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Do you want to read long essays on Elon Musk's X? I'm not sure it's the venue, but it's offering $1 milion — and the results so far are ... telling.",
    "fullText": "In the past few days on X, you haven't been able to escape a certain post that's gone viral. It offers to teach you \"How to fix your life in 1 day.\" It's an \"article,\" a newish feature that allows paid users to publish longer posts.\n\nWhat, exactly, are these new articles, and why are they everywhere?\n\nLet's start with the \"How to fix your life\" article, which has been retweeted more than 54,000 times. Its author, self-help writer Dan Koe, didn't respond to my DM asking to talk about his post. His article outlines steps to shifting your mindset to achieve goals. (This may be very appealing to people who have goals or strive for self-improvement, but as someone who is quite content to be stuck in my mediocre ways, this kind of self-help thing isn't really my jam.)\n\nI would say that, just from a content standpoint, it's sort of unusual for something like this to go super viral — it's long, it's sort of hard to read, it's not about something newsy or buzzy like, say, a Hollywood mom group fallout. I can't say for sure why this captured so much attention last week; perhaps it was just the right timing, with X wanting to push the new article format.\n\nWe’re trying something new: we’re giving $1 million to the Top Article of the next payout period.\n\nWe're doubling down on what creators on 𝕏 do best: writing.\n\nIn 2026, our goal is to recognize high-value, high-impact content that shapes conversation, breaks news and moves… pic.twitter.com/4hKBJNvNIg\n\nElon Musk's X is now offering a $1 million prize to whoever has the most viral article in the next week or so. As you might imagine, this has created a glut of articles, some of which are low-quality and likely generated by Grok or another AI.\n\nThe most interesting version of this so far is an article by a blogger who goes by \"ratlimit,\" who posted an article saying that if they win the prize, they'll split the winnings with the people who retweeted it. So far, it's been RT'd over 1,600 times. Clever!\n\nThere's also, of course, a backlash. One article went moderately viral with the headline, \"These ugly ass Articles have got to go,\" making the general point that these are unpleasant to come across in your timeline.\n\nAs someone who writes articles professionally, I suppose I have mixed feelings and a compromised perspective. I also enjoy reading lots of different kinds of articles. In fact, \"reading articles\" is one of my favorite pastimes! Not just news — I love a blog post! A review! A half-formed thought! Frankly, it feels like there aren't enough articles to read lately, and I welcome more.\n\nBut these X articles? I'm not sure this is it.\n\nThe problem is that articles written directly onto X are going to have a bit of a self-selection bias toward the kind of person who is really into X and wants to make money off X posts. That's probably … not someone I want to hear from a lot.\n\nAs X has gone deeper and deeper into a place that's somewhat unpleasant and potentially just kind of gross (the popular recent trend of asking Grok to undress people was, I think, a final straw for a lot of folks), is this really the place I want to read articles? Maybe! There's certainly still newsmakers on there, especially in certain niches like AI and tech, and hearing their thoughts is reason enough for me to stick around.\n\nBut is X a place I want to go for lengthy ideas about self-improvement? No, not even for a million dollars.",

    "description": "Janie George's home has VHS movies, trading cards, a typewriter, and more, bringing in some nostalgia and analog tech.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Janie George, 31, a mother and senior art director based in Utah. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in the '90s and 2000s with the sound of dial-up and the feeling of figuring out how to use a computer for the first time. When the first iPhone came out, I was in junior high school, and I learned more digital things as time went on.\n\nAs parents to our 3, 6, and 9-year-olds, my husband and I are trying to raise our kids with a nice balance between modern and analog. Our goal is to keep the '90s alive in our household.\n\nWe live in a really busy time, and I don't want to pretend we don't have modern conveniences in my house. We have TVs and other things that are definitely not from the '90s and back further, but living a more analog lifestyle has allowed my family to connect, slow down, and have more fun moments together. We use everything from a film camera to a typewriter, a Tin Can phone, VHS tapes, and more.\n\nIt has brought me a lot of joy, and it's been fun to share with my kids what both my husband and I experienced growing up.\n\nIt's been two or three years of trying to be more selective and more specific about the media that my kids consume as it relates to their development and attention span. A few months ago, we bought a VHS and DVD machine from Facebook Marketplace for $80.\n\nMy husband and I have been showing our kids classic movies, and my son loves to watch \"Jaws\" and \"Indiana Jones.\" I know my parents loved showing me \"Gilligan's Island,\" \"Bewitched,\" \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" and \"Hogan's Heroes,\" and I had a lot of joy experiencing their joy with them. It's been fun to connect on that and share with my kids.\n\nWe also have a Nintendo Classic Mini: Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System, which include classic games. They plug in with an HDMI and are preloaded with games, making them super easy to set up.\n\nThey can turn on what they want, rewind it, and be fully independent. When they want to play the Nintendo Switch or watch a more modern movie or something on YouTube TV, it's upstairs with mom and dad, and we're helping facilitate that.\n\nWe have a thrift store just down the road, and my kids are welcome to use the money from chores to purchase any movie they're hoping to get. We've also been looking for certain movies on eBay to add to our collection, which is really fun.\n\nSomething we've implemented and plan to do more often is creating the feeling of going to the movie rental store and picking out a movie. We've done it a couple of times: we go to Savers, a local thrift store, pick out a movie, get a pizza, pick out a treat, and have that same feeling I had, but letting them lead the way.\n\nI've taken our family photos on film for several years, and I'm trying to teach my kids that we don't need an instant photo. We can take our time, be in the moment, and feel excited about the process.\n\nIt's fun for me to pick the photos and turn them into a family book every year. A huge part of it is made up of the photos I take with that camera. You just can't capture that type of moment with an iPhone or other digital camera.\n\nI don't know if my children really care about it yet, but they love getting the chance to take the photo and hear the noises, along with the tactile feeling. I've spent a lot of money on film and developing it, but it's worth it.\n\nOne time, we found a really cool box of trading cards at Savers, and my son curated a pack of them for his friends for Christmas. One of his friends really likes the Packers, so we found all the Packers cards that were in that box and gave them to him. It just offers another activity and form of connection for my kids and their friends.\n\nThey like to take their binder of cards in the basket of their bike to their friend's home to trade cards — stuff that I watched my brothers do. I didn't offer it to them; it was just a natural thing they wanted to do.\n\nWhen one of my kids wants to have a playdate, they have to ask me to call their friend's mom to schedule it. I work full time, so it can be difficult to manage my kids' schedules in their entirety.\n\nThe Tin Can phone idea was really exciting to me because we can decide who they can call and when it's available to use, using its quiet time feature.\n\nThe Tin Can phone costs $75 plus shipping, but there's a $9.99 monthly fee to call any phone on any network. It's been 100% worth it. Sometimes on FaceTime, they want to hit all of the buttons and see all the faces. While that's fun, I don't know that they're actually communicating with the other person.\n\nBesides being able to schedule play dates, my son is having fun coming home from school and calling a friend. It's such a great way to gain skills like speaking on the phone, speaking politely, and managing their schedules. It also delays the need for a cellphone. I just want them to be present with where they are.\n\nA few years ago, one of my sons asked for a typewriter for Christmas. He had one in one of his preschool classes. It was analog and fun, and he was really excited about it. I spent $35 on a vintage typewriter on Facebook Marketplace.\n\nMy kids say they love writing letters to friends and Santa on the typewriter. They show their friends how it works, and they use it every couple of days. One of their favorite activities is when I type up a design \"brief,\" and they draw or design a logo based on that brief.\n\nWhen we bought the Tin Can phone, we thought a Rolodex would be a really fun way for them to keep track of their friends' and other phone numbers. Plus, it looks kind of cute on the table. We picked one out on eBay, typed out all of the cards with the typewriter, and decorated them with stickers.",

    "fullText": "The Defense Department is rethinking what it means to serve your country, and it no longer necessarily involves a uniform.\n\nThrough a new initiative called the US Tech Force, the federal government is recruiting college students and Silicon Valley's brightest to spend two years modernizing government systems, working as engineers, data scientists, and technical leaders.\n\n\"We're hoping to get thousands of people out of college for a two-year stint — sort of make it, this is your service to the country as a technologist rather than as a soldier,\" Emil Michael, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering and the agency's chief technology officer, said last week on the No Priors podcast, a tech show hosted by venture capitalists Sarah Guo and Elad Gil. Michael previously worked as Uber's chief business officer.\n\n\"We're going to try to make that a badge of honor,\" he added.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which is headed by former VC Scott Kupor, is coordinating the early-career program in partnership with other agencies, including the Department of Defense. Salaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said in December.\n\nThe program, announced in December, joins a long history of initiatives by Silicon Valley technologists to pluck students out of classrooms and into boardrooms. Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency famously brought a youthful energy and move-fast-and-break-things ethos to Capitol Hill. Palantir's Meritocracy Fellowship implored high schoolers to \"skip the indoctrination\" of college and \"get the Palantir Degree.\"\n\nMichael told Guo he is personally doing some of the candidate hunting, spending what he calls \"recruiting Tuesdays,\" dialing his investor buddies for people \"on the bench\" and technologists in his network who recently left a job: \"I'm like, 'Hey, do you have a year to spare doing the coolest stuff you could possibly imagine?'\"",

    "fullText": "The World Economic Forum in Davos has an unofficial dress code: neutral colors, sensible shoes, and quiet-luxury pieces built for subzero temperatures.\n\nJolie Hunt, however, doesn't follow it.\n\nThe 47-year-old founder and CEO of the communications firm Hunt & Gather, who has made more than 20 trips to the global leadership event, has turned Switzerland into her personal runway.\n\nAt this year's WEF, Hunt wore a mix of form-fitting dresses, statement heels, and designer bags — a far cry from the simple winter coat-and-boot combos seen throughout the town.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many people stop me in my tracks and say, 'I love what you're wearing,'\" Hunt told Business Insider.\n\nHer outfits have made her one of the most fashionable people you'll find in Davos as the world's elite, from business to government leaders, convene.\n\nHunt's standout fashion is on display from the moment she leaves New York City.\n\n\"I always travel in black,\" she said. \"I like a theme, and I don't like any loose ends. I'm sure I was French in a former life.\"\n\nThis year, she departed for Davos on January 18, wearing a $1,650 Balenciaga hoodie with fur trim, leather pants, and silver Givenchy sneakers. She also had two Louis Vuitton luggage pieces in hand.\n\n\"I never check a bag,\" she said. \"It's one of my super skills. I pick a theme for what I'm going to wear, down to my pajamas. Everything has a job and a purpose, so there's never any fluff.\"\n\nThis trip, she chose red as her statement color and packed shoes and accessories that complemented her chosen outfits.\n\nOne of the first she wore at Davos comprised a $3,390 printed minidress from Balmain, sheer tights, $575 Larroudé x Libertine pumps, and an Hermès bag.\n\n\"It's a black crocodile Birkin; it's very special,\" she said. \"I wouldn't usually bring it on a trip, but it matches everything, and I'm with all the masters of the universe, so I might as well bring out the big guns.\"\n\nShe wore the dress on Monday to host an event she calls the Stragglers Dinner, which brings together members of various companies and media outlets.\n\nOn Wednesday, she wore a $1,195 red Sportmax dress beneath a $3,990 Balenciaga coat, which she bought specifically for her trip to Davos.\n\nShe accessorized with her Hermès bag, knee-high boots, and sheer Saint Sass tights with the word \"killer\" printed on the thigh.\n\n\"I'm in my 'optimized for joy' part of life,\" she said. \"Maybe this comes with age and status, but I think getting a little bit older and having done this a bunch, I feel much freer in my [fashion] choices.\"\n\nShe wore the look to attend Cisco's Women in Tech breakfast, to get drinks with company executives, and to attend the Semafor Media Party, among other events.\n\nHunt was also wearing the outfit during our phone interview, during which someone stopped her to compliment the look.\n\nIn Hunt's experience, flashy outfits are uncommon at the World Economic Forum.\n\n\"Nobody wears color. It's honestly depressing,\" she said. \"You look in a room, and you don't see a single person who's not wearing navy, gray, or black — men and women.\"\n\nShe attributes that to a few things. First, the city's icy weather makes wearing heels, dresses, and other fashion pieces impractical. Second, the event is rather reserved in nature.\n\n\"For years, this was kind of a boys' club,\" Hunt said. \"Men dressed very conservatively, and I think as women became matriculated into the program, they also kept it conservative. We didn't want to ruffle too many feathers.\"\n\nWith every outfit, though, Hunt is changing that. She said her outfits bring her confidence and energy.\n\n\"In places like this, it's a little bit survival of the fittest, if I'm honest,\" she said. \"Everybody's either eyeing up your affiliation, your look, or what you can do for them. Fashion is the quickest signal that you're either intimidating, interesting, or a whole host of other things.\"",

    "title": "I landed a job at Snap after guessing the recruiter's email address. Here's my advice for other recent graduates looking for tech roles.",
    "description": "A Gen Zer landed an engineering role at Snap without a tech internship, thanks to a networking trick and support from her friends.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sreeja Apparaju, a 24-year-old machine learning engineer at Snap living in New York. Business Insider has verified Apparaju's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I decided to pivot from finance to tech in the fall of 2022, a couple of things were working against me.\n\nI was less than a year from graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with a double major in computer science and economics, and some large tech companies had announced major layoffs before the end of the year. That made me nervous about the demand for new hires.\n\nI also didn't have any tech internships to fall back on. The prior summer, I'd interned as an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, but I realized that finance didn't feel like the right path; I was more excited about the kind of work happening in tech.\n\nIt felt like unfortunate timing to be searching for tech roles — but at least I didn't have to job hunt alone.\n\nGiven these challenges, I was fortunate to have the support of a close circle of four friends who were applying to many of the same software engineering roles. When one of us heard from a recruiter or HR professional, we'd share their contact information with the group.\n\nThat's how I connected with a Palantir recruiter. Within a week of applying, I received an online assessment and was scheduled for an interview. I didn't end up getting the job, but I'm confident that getting on the recruiter's radar helped boost my chances.\n\nIn job searching, there can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of others. In my experience, though, sharing what we knew and helping each other out made the process easier — and faster — for all five of us.\n\nEvery win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was the motivation I needed to keep pushing for a job offer. One landed a role at Amazon, and another joined Salesforce. However, by the end of 2022, I was still looking.\n\nIn early January 2023, I came across an opening at Snap Inc. — the company behind Snapchat — for a software engineering role. Snap had already been on my radar as a company I thought could be a good fit. The cousin of one of my friends in my job search circle worked there, and I immediately reached out to them, obtained their referral, and submitted my application within a couple of days of the role being posted.\n\nHowever, February came around, and I still hadn't heard back from Snap. I decided to take action; I got on LinkedIn and searched for a recruiter at the company who specialized in hiring new graduates.\n\nMy goal was to reach out via email rather than a LinkedIn message. Since I didn't have a LinkedIn Premium account, I was limited in the number of characters I could use — and I worried that sending a short message would come across as superficial.\n\nI eventually found someone who appeared to be the recruiter, but their email wasn't listed anywhere. However, I did have the email of my referral contact, so I decided to guess the recruiter's email address based on the same email format — a strategy that had worked for me in the past. If I guessed incorrectly, I'd get an error message, and then I'd try a different version.\n\nI could have asked my referral for the recruiter's email, but I was already deeply grateful for their time and referral, and I felt uncomfortable asking for more.\n\nFortunately, it didn't take long for me to send an email that appeared to go through. It included my résumé and an expression of interest in the role.\n\nWithin a few days, I received a response from the recruiter and was given an online assessment to complete. Shortly after, I did my first interview — a one-hour technical and behavioral interview with an engineer.\n\nThat was followed by a final interview round, which included four one-hour technical interviews, a 30-minute Q&A session, and a 30-minute break between the third and fourth rounds — about five hours total in a single day.\n\nOne thing I like about Snap is that it's smaller than companies like Meta or Google, which means I'm given a lot of agency and independence on the projects I work on.\n\nMy top pieces of advice for other job seekers are:\n\nI'm really glad I listened to my gut and decided to pivot to tech when I started to sense during my finance internship that it wasn't the right path for me, rather than continuing down the same road.\n\nAdditionally, I'd recommend leaning on others, whether that's friends or your broader network. Given the tough job market, I've found that many people are willing to help if you reach out to them.",

The jet's screen layout, he explained, is what makes it simple.\n\nSpain's 15th Wing deployed to Šiauliai in Lithuania at the start of December for a four-month rotation to contribute to NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission, designed to protect the airspace above and around Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia — the Baltic nations on the front lines of the alliance.\n\nFighter jets are routinely scrambled on short notice from the Šiauliai base and other bases in the region to intercept Russian military aircraft flying over the Baltic Sea that aren't using their transponders, haven't filed official flight plans, or aren't communicating appropriately with air traffic control.\n\nLast year, NATO's Air Command recorded more than 500 scrambles across allied airspace as part of its air policing missions and other defensive operations.\n\nThe 200-member Spanish detachment arrived at Šiauliai with 11 EF-18M fighter jets, upgraded versions of the twin-engine F/A-18 Hornet, designed by former American defense contractor McDonnell Douglas (which later merged with Boeing).\n\nThe fourth-generation F/A-18 made its first flight in the late 1970s and entered service with the US military in the early 1980s. The fighter jet has seen extensive combat experience across the Middle East and southeastern Europe and is flown by roughly half a dozen countries today.\n\nSpain operates its own specialized version of the F/A-18 Hornet. The airframe of the EF-18 (\"E\" for España) is made in America, but Madrid has been responsible for upgrading and modifying the jets in the decades since it first purchased them, modernizing features such as the software.\n\nThe jet's exterior may look the same as those flown by Finland or Canada, but the interior is completely different, with \"all the latest technology,\" said Allen, the detachment commander.\n\n\"It's very easy to fly an F-18,\" he said. \"The most difficult part is to manage everything you have inside.\"\n\nWhen the EF-18s deployed to Šiauliai are scrambled, it is usually in response to a nearby aircraft flying without identification or failing to follow — intentional or not — international rules. While most interceptions occur without incident, the fighters are armed, ready for a threat scenario.\n\nThe Spanish EF-18s are armed with an M61A1 Vulcan 20mm cannon and can be equipped with IRIS-T short-range air-to-air missiles and AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles. The two missiles use infrared and radar homing technology, respectively.\n\nThe utility of combat-proven air-to-air weapons such as these was underscored in September when NATO fighter jets shot down Russian drones that crossed into Polish airspace during an attack against Ukraine.\n\nThe troubling incident sparked discussions among Western officials and military leaders about finding more cost-effective ways to shoot down cheap drones without relying solely on expensive jet-fired missiles.\n\n\"We can carry many air-to-air weapons, air-to-ground weapons,\" Allen said. He praised the EF-18 fighter's thrust, saying that the fighter can travel at both high and low speeds, the latter coming into play for a growing area of concern affecting alliance air policing missions.\n\n\"You can fly very, very slow,\" Allen said. \"For us, to intercept drones or small aircraft, it's not easy, but it's easier for us than any other aircraft.\"\n\nThe EF-18 is the only fighter Allen has ever flown, but others under his command have had the opportunity to experience the capabilities of other airframes firsthand.\n\nLt. Arturo Guitán, an EF-18 pilot with the 15th Wing, told Business Insider he prefers his jet to the fourth-generation Eurofighter Typhoon, developed by a consortium of European defense firms, even though the latter is a more technologically advanced aircraft.\n\n\"We love it,\" Guitán said of the EF-18, adding that the fighter is capable of performing all the mission requirements.\n\nCountries contribute to the Baltic Air Policing mission on four-month rotations; the 15th Wing will be replaced in March by Romania and France. The Spanish fighter pilots began training for the job long before they deployed to Lithuania, routinely practicing for scrambles.\n\n\"We are honored to be here, and we are very proud to be part of this kind of mission,\" said Lt. Jesus Ortín, another EF-18 pilot. \"It's a peacetime mission, so we are highly trained for this.\"\n\nDespite praise from pilots, Spain has gradually moved in recent years to replace its EF-18 fleet with orders for dozens of new Eurofighter jets. The country has also pivoted away from buying the stealth fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II, made by the US defense giant Lockheed Martin, opting instead for a European aircraft.",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

    "description": "Morgan Stanley identifies AI adoption, energy trends, societal shifts, and deglobalization as key market drivers in 2026.",
    "fullText": "There are four major themes that will drive markets in 2026, Morgan Stanley says: A multipolar world, technology diffusion, societal shifts, and the future of energy.\n\nLet's get into each, starting with the concept of a multipolar world. For Morgan Stanley, the world is becoming less globalized as governments become more protectionist.\n\n\"It's clear that policymakers globally are implementing policies that will speed up the devolution of the globalization that marked much of the post-Cold War period,\" said Stephen C Byrd, an equity strategist at the bank, in a client note on Thursday. \"Said more simply, policymakers are keen to promote their visions of national and economic security through less open commerce and more local control of supply chains and key technologies.\"\n\nSecond, the bank thinks AI will begin to be adopted more broadly by businesses, helping them boost profits. Stocks will be judged on whether their businesses are incorporating AI enough, MS said.\n\nThird, energy demand has turned a corner thanks to the AI infrastructure buildout. While demand for energy has fallen over the last couple of decades, it's now surging to all-time highs.\n\n\"We expect total US energy consumption to rise 10% over the next decade, reversing decades of declines; by 2030, it should eclipse the prior peak, set in 2007,\" Byrd wrote.\n\nFinally, societal shifts are happening in things like work (thanks to AI), and aging and longevity.\n\n\"We see multiple trends driving broad societal impacts around the world, with effects felt across a surprisingly wide range of industries,\" Byrd wrote. \"The ripple effects of AI-driven employment disruption/evolution, an aging population, changing consumer preferences, the drive for healthy longevity, and challenging demographics across many geographies will continue to matter for governments, economies, and corporates.\"\n\nAs a way to play these trends, the bank highlighted 14 US stocks that its analysts have an \"overweight\" rating on.

    "description": "Real estate investor Grant Cardone said that talks with administration insiders hint at a few things Trump could do next to boost the market.",
    "fullText": "Grant Cardone thinks the Trump administration is gearing up to do more to stimulate the US housing market.\n\nThe longtime real estate investor says he's bullish on housing as the market enters a new year, even as home prices remain high and mortgage rates are elevated.\n\nCardone told Business Insider that he recently spoke with administration insiders about what he thinks can still be done to open up the market to more Americans.\n\nPresident Trump has made affordability a primary focus in 2026 ahead of the midterm elections. In his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, he discussed high housing costs as well as interest rates, stating that the goal of homeownership is out of reach for many Americans.\n\nTrump so far has focused on mortgage rates and housing availability, pitching plans to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac load up on mortgage bonds while also banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\nNext, Cardone thinks Trump could address issues in the tax code to make the market easier to navigate.\n\nHe predicts that the White House will adjust capital gains taxes for home sales to make it less prohibitive to sell a property that has appreciated in value.\n\nCurrently, homeowners can exclude $500,000 in capital gains for married filers or $250,000 for single filers when they sell their home. Cardone expects the caps to be raised, which would make the tax bill much less burdensome and potentially bring more homes to market.\n\nOther commentators have flagged this as a simple fix to the market that can be done with relative ease. Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, said last year that the caps should be raised to $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for joint filers.\n\nThe other potential change Trump could make would allow more people to invest in real estate.\n\n\"I think he's going to come out and say, 'hey, I want to extend that bonus depreciation that was approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA),\" Cardone said. \"He's going to extend it to single-family homes.\"\n\n\"Bonus depreciation\" is a mechanism that allows investors to deduct the cost of a property from their taxes. The landmark tax and spending bill signed into law last year allows investors to deduct 100% of qualifying investment properties immediately.\n\n\"When I buy these big assets, I get to write them off basically in year one,\" Cardone explained. \"And when you buy a single-family home, you write it off over 27 years, you get a tax loss spread over that period.\"\n\nCardone thinks this would be significant, as it has never been done in the US and could stimulate more housing market activity by extending buying power to those seeking income-producing properties.\n\nWhile Cardone said his predictions have been informed by talks with administration insiders, a spokesperson denied that any specific policy moves were under discussion.\n\n\"President Trump pledged to put an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Administration is constantly exploring new policy actions to do just that, \"White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Business Insider. \"Until policy announcements are officially made by the Administration, however, any reporting about potential action is pure speculation.\"",

The alternate MAGA phrase was also included on a side panel with a Greenland flag.\n\n\"Trump maybe took one step too much,\" he said of the threats to seize the NATO ally's territory. \"We can't communicate with him — we have to say, now it's enough, because we tried.\"\n\nAn initial run of 300 hats didn't get much traction at first, but search interest and copycat products surged last weekend after Trump ramped up his rhetoric over the issue and protesters in Copenhagen and Nuuk took to the streets.\n\nAhead of the protests, Tønnesen and his team made a printed version of the hats to distribute to the crowd, turning the image into an overnight sensation.\n\nE-commerce tracking service JungleScout told Business Insider it has tracked a nearly 900% increase in search volume for the term \"Greenland\" over the past 30 days.\n\nTønnesen said he and his partners are keeping none of the profits from the hats, pledging to donate the money to Greenlandic charities.\n\n\"I have five minutes of fame where I can use this to help Greenland,\" he said. \"That's what it's all about.\"\n\nTrump said this week he has no intention of taking the territory by force and no longer intends to slap tariffs on European countries over the Greenland issue. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump also said an agreement would include \"total access\" for the US.\n\nTønnesen said he has several thousand more hats arriving in the next few days, including a design that says Greenland is \"Already Great.\"\n\nStill, he is aware that the window of public attention can be short.\n\n\"I had the possibility to speak out,\" he said. \"You have to do it when the train is running.\"",

    "description": "I got sick of running and changed my routine to focus more on walking and strength-training. I lost more fat and felt calmer.",
    "fullText": "After 10 years of jogging, I officially ran out of steam.\n\nAs much fun as I had finishing my first marathon in 2024, the training burned me out. In the months that followed, I had no desire to hit the track near my home, let alone Plus, my go-to running buddies and I all moved, making running a more solitary and, frankly, boring activity. While I could join a new local run club, I resisted.\n\nSo, in the second half of 2025, I put the brakes on my decade-long running routine. Instead of running 3 to 4 miles almost every day (and taking only two workout classes a week), I started a new schedule. I alternated taking strength-training classes with strictly walking days. That way, I go to a hard workout class about 3 to 4 times a week (still trying to fit in short walks when I can), and stroll for longer stretches the rest of the time, at least 3 miles.\n\nSwapping running with walking gave me pause at first. On one hand, I knew plenty of people who were more physically fit than me and avoided running at all costs. At the same time, I was a runner for so long, and I worried about gaining weight or becoming more sedentary.\n\nTo my surprise, I ended up burning fat more effectively than when I was running, losing about 5 pounds in about a 6-month timeframe. But the best part was mental: I felt calmer and less spread-thin, enough to actually enjoy exercising again.\n\nBecause I was so sick of running, I wasn't moving as fast as I used to, and I couldn't motivate myself to go any quicker. As a result, running three miles didn't burn as many calories for me anymore, because my body had gotten used to that pace and plateaued. To see results, I would need to increase my speed, distance, or incline — the last things I was interested in doing.\n\nSince walking burns fewer calories than running, I knew I had to dedicate more time to walking to get the same results. Now, I aim for about an hour of walking a day, double the time I spent running.\n\nEven so, it's been a lot easier to keep up with. I don't need to change into workout gear or try to squeeze in a treadmill session (that includes shower time) on my 1-hour lunch break. I just get up and go.\n\nSince I live in one of the most walkable US cities, I don't have to plan it out that much, either. I can just get off at an earlier subway stop to walk more, or step outside when my schedule frees up.\n\nIt's also been simpler to keep up with this routine when I'm on vacation. Instead of aspiring to run (and always deciding I'd rather sleep in), I commit to a daily walk or hike. That much, I can always do.\n\nKeeping a steady schedule of alternating workout and walk days means I feel more rested when I take my classes.\n\nEven if I find time to walk before class, I don't feel as depleted as I would after a 3-mile jog. I find myself lifting heavier and having more energy to really push myself — which is the only way to build muscle. Plus, I learned from wearing a heart rate monitor that I personally burn about the same number of calories in a weight training session as I do on a 3-mile jog (with the added benefit of gaining strength).\n\nWhen I do run, I opt for shorter and much faster sprints. Most of the workout classes I take have a cardio component, where the goal is power. I aim to reach a zone 4 heart rate zone on the treadmill, going at a more challenging pace. I'll run anywhere from 2 to 4 minutes faster per mile — all of which is easier and more fun for me to work on when I'm not running all the time.\n\nMy mindset around running left me feeling frazzled and resentful. It seemed like all I did was work out, but I wasn't seeing results.\n\nForcing myself to scale back and walk didn't just improve my gym performance or help me reach my weight loss goals faster. It also calmed me down.\n\nI started going on morning coffee walks with my husband, or taking laps near the office to decompress from a long day of curving my back like a cooked shrimp over my laptop. My other habits, like snacking less or cutting back on alcohol, also became less of a sacrifice. If I wasn't constantly stressing myself out to run in 20-degree weather, I didn't need a little treat to make up for it.\n\nI'm glad the opposite of my fears came true: By changing up my long-held routine, I'm getting fitter. I just needed to take some baby steps first.",

    "description": "The upfront costs to making content online are low, and two creators say that consistent posts are one of the biggest keys to success.",
    "fullText": "Creating content on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube doesn't require a big upfront investment — and it can pay big if you build and leverage an audience.\n\nMichela Allocca, founder of the personal finance brand Break Your Budget, got started with just her iPhone and an Instagram account. She had a friend take pictures of her around Boston, where she was living and working at the time, \"and I would literally post a picture of myself and write a long caption about three steps to start investing,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nWhen Allocca expanded to TikTok and YouTube in 2020, she invested in a ring light.\n\n\"You have to have good lighting,\" she said, adding that ring lights are \"very, very inexpensive.\"\n\nEven as she's grown her brand from a side project that didn't earn any money to a lucrative, full-time business, her setup hasn't become that much more complex. She still films with an iPhone and handles every part of the production process: \"I don't have an editor. I don't use anything fancy. I just edit with CapCut.\"\n\nLike Allocca, Vanessa Ideh Adekoya is a full-time content creator focused on personal finance. She has more than 600,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, Launch To Wealth, which she started in 2021 after a career at PwC.\n\n\"The internet has given us such a great opportunity to build things without really paying much money, and sometimes not even any money at all,\" Ideh Adekoya told BI.\n\nHere's the two-step process Allocca and Ideh Adekoya followed to start earning money online.\n\nOwning a specific niche helps creators build credibility, Ideh Adekoya said: \"You want to make sure that you're providing content about a specific topic so that people can identify you with that topic.\"\n\nSome niches can be more lucrative than others. Finance, business, entrepreneurship, and tech tend to be among the highest-paying categories on YouTube. That's because YouTube's business model is driven by advertising, she explained. Creators earn a share of the ad revenue generated on their videos, and advertisers in finance-related niches are often banks and large companies with bigger budgets.\n\nThis information is available to all creators, she said.\n\n\"It's not a secret. If you go to the AdSense website, there's a calculator there. If you do your research, you'll see which niches earn more money — and finance is one of them.\"\n\nAllocca encourages aspiring creators to make content that fills a gap they've personally experienced. That's what she did. When she started Break Your Budget in 2019, \"there were not a lot of women talking about personal finance online, especially in their mid-twenties.\"\n\nOnce you've established your niche, create original content you'd personally want to consume. Allocca believes that the most successful creators are the ones \"forging their own style instead of trying to recreate what works for someone else.\"\n\n\"People will stick around if they know what to expect from you,\" said Ideh Adekoya. \"If you show up today and it's great, tomorrow and it's great, and the next day it's great, they'll hit the subscribe button.\"\n\nBuilding an audience takes time and patience.\n\n\"For the first year or so, nothing really came of it,\" Allocca said of her side project. \"I used it as a creative outlet to find satisfaction outside my job.\"\n\nHer platform gained momentum when she expanded to TikTok in 2020. After growing from a few hundred followers in 2019 to about 1,000 in 2020, her audience snowballed to more than 200,000 by 2021.\n\nThat's when brands began reaching out about partnerships, and she started earning money from Break Your Budget. In the early days, brands offered about $1,000 for a TikTok video plus a link in bio.\n\nThere are various ways to monetize your content, including brand partnerships, which make up about 50% of Allocca's revenue. The other half comes from digital products, including her expense tracker and financial independence calculator.\n\nShe said she's earned more than $1 million selling her digital products, and that income is relatively passive now that the products are created.\n\nOf course, before creating and selling products, such as a course or an e-book, you have to spend time building an audeince that trusts you. Similar to her policy for creating content, Allocca has decided to make only digital products she personally finds helpful: \"I don't sell products that I don't use.\"\n\nIf you want to make a living creating content, don't treat it like a hobby.\n\n\"Treat your digital project like it's a career, and it will pay you like one,\" Ideh Adekoya said. She's intentional about every aspect of her YouTube channel, from scripting videos to word choice. \"People are not just subscribing because I'm so special. Everything is calculated. I script everything. It doesn't just happen. I sit there for hours writing line-by-line to keep my audience watching.\"\n\nEven subtle language decisions matter: \"When I speak, I don't say 'y'all' or 'you guys.' I say 'you,' so each person that's watching feels like I'm talking to her. People want to hear from people they feel connected to.\"",

    "fullText": "Bill Gross says the stock market's record rally is at risk of stalling, and fresh support is needed to keep it going.\n\nThere's been a \"little wobbling\" to start the year, signaling the market's in \"need of a cane to steady its momentum,\" the billionaire investor known as the \"Bond King\" wrote in an investment outlook on Wednesday.\n\nThe AI boom has propelled Big Tech stocks to historic highs, fueling a nearly 80% rise in the S&P 500 over the last three years. But the benchmark index has whipsawed this month between a 2.1% gain at its peak and a 0.8% decline at its trough.\n\n\"Lower interest rates would help, as would continued news that AI actually results in higher productivity, and continuing 15% plus earnings gains,\" Gross told Business Insider by email.\n\nGross, who cofounded PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly 30 years, wrote in his outlook that stocks are being shored up by rosy earnings forecasts, which are underpinned by fiscal and monetary stimulus.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that US markets could falter as \"political unrest\" threatens to undermine core capitalist principles such as \"competition and survival of the fittest.\"\n\nGross said that even in the AI space, \"tariffs and government aid\" could lead to the \"unfittest\" surviving in future marketplaces.\n\nA major trend of President Donald Trump's second term has been greater executive intervention in the business world. The federal government has taken equity stakes in corporations such as Intel, imposed sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and thrown its full weight behind AI companies' infrastructure buildout.\n\nGross also warned in his outlook that high valuations are a concern, noting a version of the Buffett Indicator that compares the S&P 500's price to nominal US GDP is at a \"historic high.\"\n\nWarren Buffett's favorite gauge shows \"froth is visible\" in the market as stock prices are rising faster than GDP, Gross told BI.\n\nThe Wall Street veteran wrote in his outlook that \"productivity, tax rates and geopolitical influences can suggest no need for a cane.\" He noted that some market bulls believe AI has changed the game, so they expect \"no wobbling — just sprinting.\"\n\n\"But I throw my hat in with the old wizard Warren Buffett,\" Gross wrote. \"Valuation casts a shadow over markets in 2026. No crash, just a forward weave requiring a cane, unlike 2025.\"\n\nOther high-profile investors have flagged lofty valuations as a headwind.\n\n\"Just your daily reminder that stocks are expensive,\" Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said in a X post last week, adding that high prices depress returns.\n\nGMO cofounder Jeremy Grantham echoed Burry on a recent podcast: \"If you want to have the highest market in history, you will have the lowest returns in history going forward.\"",

    "description": "Many young professionals are uneasy about AI automation, but they're leaning into it anyway, new research suggests.",
    "fullText": "As the first cohort to enter the workforce with AI tools at the ready, many Gen Zers are torn.\n\nSome 68% of these young professionals are anxious about AI automation, while 58% use AI tools at least three to four times a week, according to new research from think tank Oliver Wyman Forum. Nearly half of Gen Zers also say AI has already changed the caliber or type of work expected from them.\n\nThe findings, released earlier this week, are based on survey responses from 300,000 consumers and workers collected over the past five years, including 45,000 adult members of Gen Z. The most recent survey was taken last year.\n\nToday's youngest workers are leaning into AI more so than their older counterparts, who are less anxious about the technology and use it less often, the study shows.\n\nCompared with boomers, for example, Gen Zers are 1.7 times more likely to participate in AI training and 2.3 times more likely to report a productivity increase from using AI at work.\n\nYoung workers have good reason to be on high alert. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, the CEOs of Google DeepMind and Anthropic each said they're starting to see AI minimize the need for some junior roles at their companies.\n\nAnthropic's chief, Dario Amodei, also said at the conference that he hasn't changed his prediction from May, when he warned that AI could erase half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years.\n\nMeanwhile, economist Marc Sumerlin said in November that companies may pause hiring young workers as they await the benefits of AI, and that ultimately the technology could lead to fewer jobs for recent graduates. Already, some companies have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs.\n\nThe grim outlook comes as the unemployment rate for recent college graduates in the US remained elevated at 5.3% in the third quarter, according to the latest analysis from the New York Federal Reserve.\n\nSome corporate leaders are more optimistic about AI's impact on Gen Zers' careers.\n\nEarlier this month, Figma CEO Dylan Field said on the podcast \"In Good Company\" that AI skills give young professionals a hiring advantage and that the technology won't wipe out entry-level jobs.\n\nSimilarly, Reid Hoffman, the venture capitalist who cofounded LinkedIn, said in a video posted to his YouTube channel in June that young people should use their familiarity with AI as a selling point when seeking work.\n\nSome Gen Z workers say AI is helping them advance faster in their careers than they likely would have otherwise.\n\nLindsay Grippo, 28, credits the technology for helping her practice big-picture strategic thinking when drafting newsletters, blog posts, and other copy for her editor role at Codeword, a New York-based digital marketing agency. She views the AI's output as if it's from a more junior creative.\n\n\"I'm assessing how well it meets a project's goals, similar to how my manager might review my work,\" she said. \"It is training me to think like a more senior-level creative.\"\n\nKyle Monson, a founding partner at Codeword, said the agency hasn't changed its hiring plans in response to AI, and that young employees like Grippo seem to be among the most proficient users of the technology.\n\nA 46-year-old Gen Xer, Monson sees AI fluency as an advantage for young workers that makes him jealous. When he started his career, he said he had to do a lot of grunt work, such as data entry and note-taking, before he could advance.\n\nAI can now do those kinds of tasks, allowing junior talent to tackle higher-value assignments, which he described as those that require making judgment calls.\n\n\"That's when your career really starts to take off,\" said Monson.",

    "fullText": "Misinformation technology could be deployed at scale to disrupt 2028 US presidential election, AI researchers say\n\nPolitical leaders could soon launch swarms of human-imitating AI agents to reshape public opinion in a way that threatens to undermine democracy, a high profile group of experts in AI and online misinformation has warned.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize-winning free-speech activist Maria Ressa, and leading AI and social science researchers from Berkeley, Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge and Yale are among a global consortium flagging the new “disruptive threat” posed by hard-to-detect, malicious “AI swarms” infesting social media and messaging channels.\n\nA would-be autocrat could use such swarms to persuade populations to accept cancelled elections or overturn results, they said, amid predictions the technology could be deployed at scale by the time of the US presidential election in 2028.\n\nThe warnings, published today in Science, come alongside calls for coordinated global action to counter the risk, including “swarm scanners” and watermarked content to counter AI-run misinformation campaigns. Early versions of AI-powered influence operations have been used in the 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia.\n\n“A disruptive threat is emerging: swarms of collaborative, malicious AI agents,” the authors said. “These systems are capable of coordinating autonomously, infiltrating communities and fabricating consensus efficiently. By adaptively mimicking human social dynamics, they threaten democracy.”\n\nOne leading expert in propaganda technology, Inga Trauthig, said the adoption of such advanced technology is likely to be slowed by politicians’ reluctance to cede campaign control to AIs. Another cause for skepticism is concern that using such illicit techniques would not be worth the risk, given voters are still more influenced by offline material.\n\nThe experts behind the warning include New York University’s Gary Marcus, a prominent sceptic about the claimed potential of current AI models who calls himself a “generative AI realist”, and Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s first digital minister, who has warned: “Those in the pay of authoritarian forces are undermining electoral processes, weaponizing AI and employing our societal strengths against us.”\n\nOthers include David Garcia, professor for social and behavioural data science at the University of Konstanz, Sander van der Linden, a misinformation expert and director of Cambridge University’s social decision-making lab, and Christopher Summerfield, AI researcher and professor of cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.\n\nTogether they say political leaders could deploy almost limitless numbers of AIs to masquerade as humans online and precisely infiltrate communities, learn their foibles over time and use increasingly convincing and carefully tailored falsehoods, to change population-wide opinions.\n\nThe threat is being supercharged by advances in AIs’ ability to pick up on the tone and content of discourse. They are increasingly able to mimic human dynamics, for example, by using appropriate slang and posting irregularly to avoid detection. Progress in the development of “agentic” AI also means the ability to autonomously plan and coordinate action.\n\nAs well as operating across social media, they may use messaging channels and even write blogs or use email, depending on which channel the AI thinks best helps achieve an aim, said one of the authors, Daniel Thilo Schroeder, a research scientist at the Sintef research institute in Oslo.\n\n“It’s just frightening how easy these things are to vibe code and just have small bot armies that can actually navigate online social media platforms and email and use these tools,” said Schroeder, who has been simulating swarms in laboratory conditions.\n\nAnother of the authors, Jonas Kunst, professor of communication at the BI Norwegian Business School, said: “If these bots start to evolve into a collective and exchange information to solve a problem – in this case a malicious goal, namely analysing a community and finding a weak spot – then coordination will increase their accuracy and efficiency.\n\n“That is a really serious threat that we predict is going to materialise.”\n\nIn Taiwan, where voters are regularly targeted by Chinese propaganda, often unknowingly, AI bots have been increasing engagement with citizens on Threads and Facebook in the last two to three months, said Puma Shen, a Taiwanese Democratic Progressive Party MP and campaigner against Chinese disinformation.\n\nDuring discussions on political topics the AIs tend to provide “tonnes of information that you cannot verify”, creating “information overload”, Shen said. He said AIs might cite fake articles about how America will abandon Taiwan. Another recent trend is for the AI bots to stress to younger Taiwanese people that the China-Taiwan dispute is very complicated “so do not take sides if you have no knowledge”.\n\n“It’s not telling you that China’s great, but it’s [encouraging them] to be neutral,” Shen told the Guardian. “This is very dangerous, because then you think people like me are radical.”\n\nAmid signs the progress of AI technology is not as rapid as Silicon Valley companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have claimed, the Guardian asked independent AI experts to assess the swarm warnings.\n\n“In the election-heavy year of 2024 the capabilities were there for AI-driven microtargeting but we didn’t see as much of that as scholars predicted,” said Trauthig, an adviser to the International Panel on the Information Environment. “Most political propagandists I interview are still using older technologies and are not at this cutting edge.”\n\n“It isn’t fanciful,” said Michael Wooldridge, professor of the foundations of AI at Oxford University. “I think it is entirely plausible that bad actors will try to mobilise virtual armies of LLM-powered agents to disrupt elections and manipulate public opinion, for example targeting large numbers of individuals on social media and other electronic media. It’s technologically perfectly feasible … the technology has got progressively better and much more accessible.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "Growing concerns about the impact of smartphones on the youngest children must be addressed\n\nThe first UK government guidance on young children’s use of tablets, smartphones and other screens, expected in April, cannot come soon enough. The laissez-faire approach to the boom in social media, handheld devices and other digital technology was arguably nowhere less suitable than when such machines were placed in front of babies. The Department for Education’s ongoing Children of the 2020s study has found that 98% of two-year-olds watch screens on a typical day for more than two hours. Those who spent the most time had smaller vocabularies, and were twice as likely as other children to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.\n\nCorrelation must not be mistaken for causation. This is still a relatively new area of research, and much remains uncertain. But the findings of a recent survey by the charity Kindred Squared, combined with observations by teachers, are highly concerning. Answers from 1,000 primary-school staff revealed that 37% of four-year-olds arrived without basic life skills such as dressing and eating in 2025 – up from 33% two years earlier.\n\nSome of these may have additional needs. And there is no suggestion from the charity that screens are the only issue. Stresses caused by the high cost of living, cuts to local early years services and other factors affect the quality of the youngest children’s lives. But many teachers, along with one of their unions, the NASUWT, believe that the impact of screens must be addressed, with parents as well as children encouraged to prioritise books and bricks over swipes and clicks.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that children under two should not use screens at all. But even if such prohibitions are unlikely to be heeded by the majority, ministers could be more ambitious in making the case for a precautionary approach. The importance of early speech, communication and emotional development should be clearly explained, and parents given support when they need it.\n\nSince global outrage was sparked earlier this month by nudification on Grok, and the ease with which such images could be shared on X, the debate around regulation has dramatically shifted. Over recent days, Kemi Badenoch has thrown her party’s weight behind an age limit of 16 for social media apps, following Australia’s example. With a number of Labour MPs sympathetic, the government is under pressure to agree.\n\nThose pushing for tougher rules are right that existing regulations are full of holes. Age verification should have been introduced sooner. Addictive features should never have been allowed on children’s accounts. But in the rush to gain political advantage from the current spike in concern, there is a risk of issues becoming confused. When considering screens and preschool children, a key question is what other activities (books, toys, ballgames) are being replaced, and why this matters. Weighing the impact of social media and smartphones on teenagers involves different calculations. Nudification apps are a distinct problem. It could be argued that the new focus on under-16s risks distracting attention from the more general danger posed by sexually explicit AI-generated material.\n\nOfcom’s prompt response to the Grok/X nudification outcry was welcome. Politicians and campaigners may be right that under-16s’ social media use should be restricted. Warnings about screens and toddlers should be heeded. The wider message of the past few weeks is that democratic oversight of the tech industry needs to accelerate.\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "fullText": "Majority US-owned venture includes Larry Ellison’s Oracle, private-equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi’s MGX\n\nTikTok announced on Thursday it had closed a deal to establish a new US entity, allowing it to sidestep a ban and ending a long legal battle.\n\nThe deal finalized by ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese owner, sets up a majority American-owned venture, with investors including Larry Ellison’s Oracle, the private-equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi’s MGX owning 80.1% of the new entity, while ByteDance will own 19.9%.\n\nThe announcement comes five years after Donald Trump first threatened to ban the popular platform in the US during his first term.\n\nTikTok’s future in the US had been unclear, a saga that began after Congress overwhelmingly voted to pass a law banning the social media app in 2024 unless it found a US buyer. The supreme court upheld the law in January 2025, but on Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order postponing the ban.\n\nHe has since repeatedly continued to delay its enforcement while the US, the company and potential American partners were negotiating over an agreement.\n\nIn September, Trump signed another executive order, which outlined a plan for US investors to take over the majority of the company’s operations and for the new version of TikTok to be controlled by a seven-member, majority-American board of directors of cybersecurity and national security experts.\n\nAdam Presser, who previously served as TikTok’s general manager and global head of operations and trust & safety, would serve as CEO of the new venture, the company said on Thursday.\n\nThe US joint venture is overseen by a seven-member board of directors, including executives from Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX and TPG, as well as Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s chief executive.\n\nThe US entity will “operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for US users”, the announcement said. The content recommendation algorithm will be retrained, tested and updated based on US user data, the firm added.\n\nA White House official said the Chinese and US governments had signed off on the deal. A Chinese embassy spokesperson told Politico his country’s “position on TikTok has been consistent and clear” and that he had “no new information to share at the moment”.\n\nIn a post on social media Thursday night, Trump thanked China’s president, Xi Jinping, “for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal”. “I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok! It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” the president wrote.\n\nConcerns from US lawmakers and officials about TikTok center around user data security, with fears that the Chinese government could use the platform to harvest data from American users, claims which the company has repeatedly denied.\n\nThe legislation passed in 2024 under Joe Biden barred ByteDance from retaining operational ties with a US TikTok venture, but the law gave the president authority to decide if a deal complies with its requirements.\n\nThe threat of a ban had caused widespread backlash in the US from influencers and creators who depend on the app.\n\nSilver Lake, Oracle and MGX will each hold 15% in the new venture, the company said. The investment firm of Michael Dell, the billionaire founder of Dell Technologies, is also an investor.\n\nUnder the arrangement, Oracle will oversee the algorithm that recommends videos in US users. The system will be retrained using US data to “ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation”, Chew said.\n\nChina will retain control of the algorithm, with the country’s cybersecurity regulator previously saying it had agreed that any TikTok US deal would include “licensing … and other intellectual property rights”.",

    "fullText": "AI evangelist Peter Kyle wants to scale up businesses, attract overseas investors and look out for UK’s poorer regions\n\nThe UK business secretary, Peter Kyle, has said he is “betting big” and “picking winners” as the government takes direct stakes in growing businesses to boost economic growth.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have been talking up Britain’s prospects, Kyle said ministers were taking an “activist” approach to industrial policy.\n\nThe idea of “picking winners” is closely associated with the Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher’s attacks on Labour’s 1970s strategy and her argument that it should be the private sector that decides which companies thrive.\n\nKyle was unabashed about invoking the phrase, arguing a muscular approach could accelerate economic growth. “I want to make sure that the benefits of growth are felt quicker than is currently the case. We’re predicted to grow 1.5% this year. That is not enough.”\n\nHe highlighted the recent decision to allow the £26bn state-owned British Business Bank to buy equity stakes in companies, including the announcement last week of a £25m investment in the energy supplier Octopus’s software spin-off, Kraken.\n\n“The most potential in our economy, in the short and medium term, is scale-up companies,” Kyle said. “I was at Octopus yesterday. They’re now employing 1,500 people in their head office in London alone.\n\n“We can find other companies that are on that kind of trajectory and we can expedite their growth. Then it will create thousands of new jobs, and it will create enormous amounts of wealth, which will recycle through the economy in a really fast way.”\n\n“I am betting big. And I am picking winners,” he added. “It’s more activist. And there will be things that don’t work out, sure. But to have a healthy economy, failure leads to success.”\n\nThis week’s summit in the Swiss ski resort has been overshadowed by Donald Trump’s threat to slap tariffs on eight European countries if they stood in the way of his hopes of annexing Greenland.\n\nThe president backed away from the idea of punitive import taxes on Wednesday evening, after discussions with the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, but several leaders in the Swiss ski resort have said the global economic order has irrevocably changed.\n\nKyle insisted international uncertainty was no reason not to press ahead with Labour’s agenda, highlighting the prospects of a “wave of opportunity that technology and life sciences and all these huge, huge, positive waves of innovation are going to present to us”.\n\nHe said: “If we are too intimidated by the global challenges, if we are too distracted by domestic political to and fro, then we will take our eye off the ball, and we will miss the opportunity of a lifetime, and that means real things to real people.\n\n“There will be kids growing up like me that will not end up becoming successful like I have. It’ll be communities that, at the moment, are poor, and they will never have a hope of becoming prosperous. And I won’t stand for it. I would literally do anything. And if that means betting [on] winners, and getting it wrong from time to time, I’ll take it.”\n\nAnnouncing the beefing up of the government’s “global talent taskforce” in his department, the business secretary suggested that the UK hoped to capitalise on the instability unleashed by Trump’s policies to help it attract jobs and investment.\n\n“I will suck the best talent in from wherever it exists, and talent goes both ways across the Atlantic. And I want to make sure that we have a good balance in that because for too long it’s been in one direction,” he said.\n\nHighlighting the need to attract innovators in particular, Kyle added: “America is being disruptive with tariffs, but America isn’t the most friendly place for scientific endeavour in any case at the moment. Do the maths and add up where we’re going with this. We are going out there and we’re saying: ‘Actually, we have one of the best regulatory environments in the world for life sciences, and across the board.’”\n\nKeir Starmer has taken a tough line on migration – despite pushback from some quarters in the party – promising to reduce it and condemning Boris Johnson’s administration for what the prime minister has called an “open borders experiment”.\n\nBut Kyle said he did not think public scepticism about migration extended to wealthy entrepreneurs. “People are deeply concerned about the immigration system we inherited, and the asylum system, which was overwhelmed, and was poorly administered by the Tories, and therefore broken,” he said.\n\n“I’ve never had anybody that says that people with a lot of money to invest in our country, who want to come here and create jobs, create businesses, shouldn’t be coming to do so.”\n\nHe added: “I have a taskforce that’s doing this, embedded in our global network. We can offer the world’s most talented a bespoke package to come to the UK swiftly, to embed, and then, of course, be part of a funding landscape that is bountiful.”\n\nThe 55-year-old MP for Hove and Portslade has been business secretary since Starmer’s September reshuffle, replacing Jonathan Reynolds, who had done the job for several years in opposition.\n\nKyle is politically close to the health secretary, Wes Streeting – who has been repeatedly mooted as a potential challenger to Starmer – but has been scrupulously loyal to the prime minister in public.\n\nEarlier this week, the business secretary rejected the suggestion that the UK try to negotiate a customs union with the EU, for which Streeting has signalled his support, telling the FT: “I think at the moment it would be foolish to slip towards what would be simple solutions.”\n\nKyle has dyslexia and left his state school “without any usable” qualifications, as he has put it. He made his way to university aged 25, and went on to secure a PhD, then worked in the charity sector before entering politics.\n\nIn his previous job of technology secretary, he was forced to defend his closeness to powerful tech companies. He is a regular user of the chatbot ChatGPT and an evangelist for the opportunities offered by the technology – and is often seen in the casual garb favoured by “tech bros”.\n\nSoon after taking on his current role, Kyle struck a deal with business groups and trade unions to water down the implementation of Labour’s Employment Rights Act, introducing a six-month probation period before the promised “day-tone rights” come into force.\n\nHe has continued to work closely with his successor and friend, Liz Kendall, and said he has insisted the connecting door that blocked the corridor between their two offices be opened up.\n\nAsked whether AI would cause mass layoffs as companies decide they can manage without entry-level staff – a hot topic at Davos – Kyle said: “People are anxious and it’s going to be painful and difficult because change is always painful and difficult.”\n\nKyle said Labour was ready to intervene to ensure the adoption of AI was less painful for poorer communities than the deindustrialisation of the 1980s, which cast a long shadow.\n\nHe said: “Waves of industrial change have always gone badly when governments stand on the sidelines and are not participants. And I will not allow that to happen.\n\n“As tech secretary I was negotiating deals for investment in digital infrastructure, insisting it happened in poorer parts of the country. I’m the gatekeeper into our country for a lot of investors. And if they want to come and benefit from our country, then they can contribute to it as well.”",

    "fullText": "A new season in football's National League begins this weekend as the chasing pack seek to make ground on all-conquering Kerry. The Kingdom are the team to beat going into 2026, but there is plenty to play for this season across the divisions with promotion and relegation potentially season-defining. Former Donegal star Brendan Devenney runs his eye over what may lie ahead in year two of Gaelic football's new rules.\n\nI covered last year's league final between Kerry and Mayo which was a poor enough affair.\n\nYou could see nobody was that worried, but what Jack O'Connor does is win the league which is a precursor to the championship.\n\nThey had a couple of rocky games after that with Cork putting it up to them [in Munster] and Meath got to them [in the championship] so we didn't see them as the finished article until they got to the All-Ireland final when they were on another level and reaching those heights again will make them very hard to stop.\n\nIn terms of the game itself, I think a big focus this year will be on scoring and preventing the two-pointers, while winning around the middle on kick-outs will be crucial.\n\nIf teams put a full squeeze on from the kick-out, the majority will be long and if you have big, physical men around the middle, that will be a huge asset.\n\nDefensively, you just can't lie in and shut the game down now because you can be picked off with two-pointers or if you move out, you can be hit with a ball over the top.\n\nAfter a period to fully figure out their approach, this weekend will be interesting to see how teams have adapted.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes has been in fine form since returning from injury, creating goals in consecutive Premier League games against Burnley and Manchester City.\n\nSince Ruben Amorim's departure he has also been deployed in a more attacking role, perhaps freeing him up to make a greater contribution.\n\nBut with United travelling to Premier League leaders Arsenal - who boast the best defensive record in the division - on Sunday, is it a week too early to reintroduce the Portugal midfielder?\n\nFPL expert Holly Shand and some of the team from the FPL Podcast assess when the time might be right to bring Fernandes back.",

That shouldn't be forgotten,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Did we have a drink when we were allowed to? Yes. Did we work hard and train when it was scheduled? Of course.\"\n\nKiely also questioned the idea that the team were left to train without footballs.\n\n\"We definitely had footballs, because otherwise we wouldn't have got sessions done.\"\n\nAlthough Kiely remembers that the facilities could have been better, he said they were \"definitely not Sunday league level\".",

There have been no discussions yet and it remains to be seen how open Mainoo is to signing a new deal given his well-publicised desire to leave United on loan last summer.\n\nMainoo has not started a single Premier League game this season under Ruben Amorim and was hoping to secure a loan move during the current transfer window.\n\nHowever, since Amorim's exit Mainoo has been reintegrated into the senior fold.\n\nInterim boss Darren Fletcher started the 20-year-old in the FA Cup third round defeat by Brighton earlier this month and Mainoo kept his place for Michael Carrick's first game in charge as United beat City convincingly in last weekend's Manchester derby.\n\nMainoo signed a long-term deal in 2023 but it was thought a new contract would be agreed with the player in the wake of his goalscoring contribution to United's 2024 FA Cup final win over City, which was followed by the youngster starting England's Euro 2024 final defeat by Spain.\n\nHowever, there was no agreement at that time and the treatment he received following Amorim's arrival left the Mainoo camp wondering whether United value the player.",

Given Strand Larsen's poor form and deteriorating relationship with fans, he is expected to leave Molineux.\n\nThe 25-year-old signed from Celta Vigo, initially on loan, in 2024 and scored 14 goals last season before making the move permanent in the summer for £23m.\n\nA hat-trick in the FA Cup against Shrewsbury this month took his tally to six goals for the season, but only one of those has come in the league.\n\nNewcastle failed with bids of £50m and £55m for Strand Larsen in August.",

They were screaming between my first and second serve really loud to make me make a mistake.\n\n\"On a big point, a guy started coughing for my shot. I was like, 'OK, I'm not going to lose'.\n\n\"Some people have an education of tennis and, unfortunately, some of them do not.\"\n\nShe joked: \"I'm very happy that I kept my calm, because Yulia last year would probably throw something at them at some moment.\"",

    "fullText": "WAYNE — At this time last year, Arhip Akhmedov was playing club hockey in Colorado. Since his move to New Jersey and enrolling at St. Joseph (Montvale), Akhmedov had not scored a goal for the Green Knights until the spotlight was brightest.\n\nAkhmedov's shot from inside the blue line 8:14 into overtime lifted the Green Knights over Don Bosco, 2-1, on Jan. 22 for the program's second consecutive Bergen County Tournament championship.\n\nA fast and physical game from start to finish, Don Bosco pressured St. Joseph early in the first period, but surrendered the game's first goal on the first shot of the night from the Green Knights. Jason Juneau poked a puck into the crease and past Alex Annunziato for a 1-0 lead 2:12 into the game.\n\nDon Bosco led wire to wire in shots on goal, but were held off the scoreboard until a second period goal by Niko Pappachristou to tie the game at one. The game would remain tied for another 30 minutes of game play until Akhmedov's game-winner.\n\nThe tournament final marked the third time this season that Don Bosco and St. Joseph faced off with all three games ending in 2-1 finals. Don Bosco won the first two matchups on Dec. 4 and Jan. 16.\n\nPending any upsets in the postseason, there's likelihood that the two schools will face off at least one more time. Don Bosco and St. Joseph could be heading for a fourth encounter during the upcoming Gordon Cup playoffs with a fifth game even possible in the state's Non-Public playoffs set to kick off in February.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: St. Joe’s Montvale NJ hockey repeats as Bergen County champ in OT win",

    "fullText": "LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) – Waverly basketball has started the season with a 9-2 record, including a win against Lansing Sexton in the “Battle for Michigan Ave.” The Warriors’ success has earned them our Team of the Week award.\n\nSenior leadership is one of the biggest reasons for Waverly’s success so far this season, according to Waverly basketball coach Rod Watts. Derek Thomas II had a team-high 28 points in their win over Lansing Sexton on Saturday. Xavier Pendergrass finished with 17 points.\n\nWatts described Thomas and Pendergrass as forces in the paint and how important it is for his team to feed them early, to establish dominance and get his two playmakers going.\n\n“When you don’t feed the guys inside, they get frustrated and we get frustrated and I get frustrated,” explained Watts. “They may tend not to work for you, so got to feed them early and I think the outside will open up. So this is one of the things got to focus on.”\n\nWaverly is currently on a five-game winning streak and Thomas says he feels this is just the tip of the iceberg for how good he feels his team can be.\n\n“We had dropped two, so going on this win streak to start the year of 2026, it feels really good,” said Thomas. “We feel like we have our best games ahead of us.”\n\nWaverly will look to make it six wins in a row when they face Lansing Everett on January 23rd at 7:00p.m.",

    "fullText": "Over his 23 years in the NBA, LeBron James has had many rivals who have tried to get under his skin. However, arguably, none of them have been as successful in recent history as Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks, a hard-nosed defensive specialist with erratic habits, someone who has consistently gotten a reaction out of the King. Now, Brooks has publicly addressed his tactics.\n\n“If this was LeBron, maybe five years ago, then it’d be different,” Brooks said about James to Twitch streamer Agent during a recent appearance on his livestream. “Miami Bron, you’re not really talking shit to him for real, cause then it’s like, blow by, dunk. He’s got more game to him, more agile. Right now, he’s like, like I’ve always been saying, he’s old.”\n\nFor Brooks, it’s clear that trash talk is just one more tactic that he uses as a part of his defensive identity, and a situational way to disrupt rhythm and force opposing stars into emotionally engage with him. Whether that approach is criticized or lauded has never seemed much to matter to him.\n\nWith the Phoenix Suns, even as he experiences as increased offensive role which averaging career-highs across the board, Brooks’ defensive edge hasn’t softened. He presented his mindset as preparation, something he’s seen doing frequently before games, and a belief that every aspect of his opponent’s temperament and limitations factor into being able to stop them on defense.\n\n“You can press up on him,” Brooks continued on James. “You can cut him off spots so you know his moves he’s going to do. So you can always chirp a little bit. For some reason, he likes to do a little chirping… I got like quick twitch back.”\n\nWhen the Phoenix Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers met earlier this season, the tension between LeBron James and Dillon brooks was evident throughout the game. Brooks drew the James assignment for most of the game, playing extremely physically, crowding his space and talking throughout the night as the matchup felt almost playoff-like in it’s edge.\n\nOne key possession highlighted the double-edged approach of Brooks’ tactics. With just over 12 seconds left in the game, the Suns forward drilled a go-ahead three right in James’ face, seemingly validating his approach.\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, James seemingly rolled over Brooks, resulting in a no-call, causing the two to get briefly entangled. Brooks was quickly assessed his second technical following this exchange and was ejected, a sequence that eventually snowballed into handing the Lakers a win from the late advantage.\n\nLooking back, this game clearly reads as a real-time example of everything Brooks talked about on stream with Agent. He pressed up on James, cut off his preferred spots, leaned into constant chatter, and while James ultimately sealed the win late, the exchange highlighted why every matchup between the two is primetime.\n\nBrooks isn’t just challenging perhaps the greatest player in league history, but actively pushing the margins of engaging against superstars.\n\nThe post Dillon Brooks Takes Aim at Aging LeBron James While Explaining Trash Talk Tactics appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "LAKELAND —There were three Polk County high school cheer state runner ups in this year's FHSAA 2026 Competitive Cheerleading State Championships Thursday at the RP Funding Center in Lakeland.\n\nBartow, Lakeland and George Jenkins all achieved the feat. For Bartow, the Yellow Jackets won it in the Large Co-ed, while Lakeland was in the Large Non-Tumbling, and George Jenkins racked it up in Medium Co-ed.\n\nBartow was able to execute a pyramid, among other displays. Overall, their cheer was exceptional and précised, helping the program to tack on a 76.70.\n\n\"I feel like this performance was to show they had the confidence (on) what they were doing for this whole season. We had a lot of ups and downs. We stuck together and this group that we have really loves this sport. Today was just to go out there, show people that you love it, and you been doing this months on months. Just give them what you know. This is Bartow, so just show them,\" Bartow head cheer coach Jovon Penny said after the competition.\n\nRegionals: Polk County cheer teams qualify for state, top regional performances\n\nLake Gibson: Here's how Lake Gibson cheer changed a Polk County trend\n\nPenny said for nationals, he needs the team to focus on hitting before moving on to the hard moves.\n\nLakeland — a team that won three straight national titles — also strives for the basics. And in their performance, they were able to execute their first stunt well and like Bartow, their cheer was spirited, though the pyramid and the second stunt had some bobbles, which still led to an 86.50 score.\n\n\"It was a lot of fight. It wasn't the performance we had in regionals. ... Regionals was a really good performance,\" Lakeland head coach Crystal Abdon said.\n\nGeorge Jenkins scored 86.4, which was better than a performance in regionals in which the program had three falls. And the only team that had higher score was Strawberry Crest, which scored the most points (92.70) in all divisions. In order to achieve the program's first runner-up finish in the co-ed division — just the second year the program is in the division — the flying Eagles registered a hit\n\n\"I feel incredible. We haven't hit at a comp all season, so to finish with a hit is all we can ask for. I told the kids, regardless what happens, as long we focus ... then that was a win, and they more than did that tonight. So we are super happy. It's a win for us no matter what happens,\" George Jenkins head cheer coach Kiley Viggiano-Ramsuer said.\n\nWinter Haven in the Small Varsity division managed a 66.8 score and a seventh-place finish after the safety violation ― a situation in which a spotter was in the wrong place, which deducted a point. Still, the Blue Devils displayed back hand spring ups, hand-to-hand inversions, low to high and high to high switches, as well as a shotgun in the pyramid.\n\n\"I am very proud because the team hit a very difficult and new pyramid,\" Winter Haven head cheer coach Ali Roberts said. \"It felt good to compete at states this year because last year, we did not advance to states.\"\n\nLake Gibson was sixth with an 83.50 in the Gameday division, which was the biggest division there was this year. The Braves, though, needed to go through 13 different teams before advancing to finals to compete against 10 teams.\n\n\"Overall, our team's culture was great, which I beleive resulted in us making it as far as we did. I'm a very proud coach,\" Lake Gibson head cheer coach Jezyiah DeShazor said.\n\nLake Wales in Small Non-Tumbling placed fifth with a 74.70.\n\n\"Our performance today did not go as we hoped. Back to work these next two weeks as we chase the hit feeling to end our season together at high school nationals,\" Lake Wales head cheer coach Brandi Kehres said.\n\nAnd Auburndale was eighth in the same division with a 69.60.\n\nDay 2 is Friday. And nationals is set for Feb. 7-10 at ESPN's Wide World of Sports in Orlando.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Ledger: Bartow, Lakeland, George Jenkins finish as state runners-up at state cheer; Polk results",

    "fullText": "Hailie Deegan isn’t playing it safe as she is set to make her return to NASCAR with a bold mission, and that is to challenge Danica Patrick’s long-held grip on NASCAR history\n\nFor more than a decade, Danica Patrick has been the only woman to have found much success in NASCAR. The 24-year old is officially returning to her roots, confirming she will pilot the No.16 Chevrolet in the ARCA Menards Series West. But what’s more impressive is the goal she has set for her 2026 season. While taking a few notes from Patrick’s notebook would be helpful, Deegan is busy charting out her own ambitious path.\n\nSpeaking on her YouTube channel, Hailie Deegan sounded more determined than ever.\n\n“Obviously, the championship is on my mind,” she said. “I feel like it’s a year-long battle, but when it comes to those kinds of smaller goals that I have, more short-term ones, is to win four races. It’d be really cool to be the first female to win a NASCAR championship. So that would be huge for me.”\n\nTo be the first female champion in NASCAR would definitely be a dream come true, and it would especially mean surpassing what Danica Patrick has managed to achieve in the male-dominated sport.\n\nDanica Patrick has shattered barriers throughout her racing career by achieving several historic firsts that no woman had before in NASCAR.\n\nIn 2013, she became the first woman ever to win a pole position in the NASCAR Cup Series by setting the fastest lap and qualifying for the Daytona 500, a feat that marked the highest starting point for a female driver and NASCAR’s premier division.\n\nThat same year at Daytona, she also became the first woman to lead laps, guiding her car to the front of the field and finishing it, the best result by a woman in that race’s history at the time.\n\nOn NASCAR, Patrick’s trailblazing extended to open-wheel racing as well. Earlier in her career, she became the first woman to lead laps in the Indianapolis 500 and went on to become the first woman to win a major IndyCar race, triumphing at the Indy 300 in 2008.\n\nHowever, a championship has always been out of her grass and that is where Hailie Deegan steps in. Deegan wants to achieve the same and more. However, it will require a lot of practice and a lot more patience.\n\nDeegan’s NASCAR journey has been far from smooth sailing. After a failed experiment with IndyCar, the 24-year-old struggled to get on NASCAR seat.\n\nShe was racing for HMD Motorsports in the 2025 Indy NXT season. But the California native, who is unable to perform her best and ended her stint in the series with a P14 finish in the drivers’ championship, is a far cry from what she expected.\n\nMoreover, she was hosted from her Xfinity seat all of a sudden in 2024. It definitely left her with a lot of regret.\n\nOver 69 truck series starts, Deegan managed just five top 10 finishes. Our conference took another hit after a difficult 2025 season in IndyCar. However, she is not done yet. Deegan is ready to reset and rebuild, and she has chosen to do it when she first program ourselves, back in the ARCA West Series.\n\nDeegan has shown she can win in the NASCAR lower division. She captured three ARCA West victories in 2018, 2019, and 2020. She ran a season in the series, finishing third in the standings despite winning that year.\n\nAnd now with her résumé and grit, a championship may not seem too far, but only time will tell if she achieves the ultimate goal.\n\nDeegan’s return to NASCAR with Bill McAnally Racing and NAPA is a headline-making move that has thrust her back into the spotlight, and the demo couldn’t be happier.\n\nA decision to return to the ARCA Series is a major development, and it could be the research she needs to rebuild momentum. More importantly, Bill McAnally was quick to express his excitement about the 24-year-old joining the lineup and what it means for the 2026 plans.\n\nFor McAnally, bringing Deegan back feels like returning to a familiar chapter. He spoke fondly of their past partnership, highlighting the success they shared in the bins they collected along the way.\n\nHe also made it clear that her return would boost the team’s championship hope especially with Mason Massey also competing for the title.\n\n“Having Hailie back on our team is incredibly special. We enjoyed working together several years ago and won some races,” he said. “I see the commitment she has for competing at this level, and we want to be part of her success. She has the knowledge of winning out West, and we have a great chance to chase our 12th title with her and Mason Massey in the fold.”\n\nWith 2026 on the horizon, Deegan’s return also highlights the growing presence of women in a traditionally male-dominated sport. More female drivers competing at the highest levels of stock car racing not only push the sport to greater equality but also add new rivalries and fresh energy to the track. Her comeback could inspire other women to chase their own NASCAR dreams and prove that success in racing is not limited by gender.\n\nThe post Hailie Deegan Targets Danica Patrick’s Long-Standing NASCAR Grip With Bold 2026 Goal appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

While they wear different uniforms, respect is all the Diamondbacks shortstop has for the Dodgers superstar.\n\n“Ohtani’s my brother,” Perdomo said. “That guy is out of this league, Ohtani’s out of this league.” (Translated from Spanish to English)\n\nSep 25, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles Dodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani (17) at bat in the seventh inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field. Mandatory Credit: Allan Henry-Imagn Images\n\nPerdomo shared a story involving the reigning National League MVP from last season, detailing an exchange that highlighted both competition and camaraderie. After picking up a few Japanese phrases from a team trainer, Perdomo approached Ohtani and asked him for a signed bat.\n\n“He understood,” Perdomo recalled. “And he said, ‘If I win and get you out.'”\n\nThe Diamondbacks ultimately won the game, with Perodmo hitting the walk-off hit in the victory against Los Angeles. Despite “losing” the bet, Perdomo continued to express his awe for Ohtani’s elite talent.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers pitcher Shohei Ohtani (17) throws to the Arizona Diamondbacks in the first inning at Chase Field in Phoenix on Sept. 23, 2025. © Rob Schumacher / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nOhtani doesn’t just paint corners, but also has a blazing fastball that can hit 100 mph. With a mixed arsenal at his disposal, hitters are left guessing all the time.\n\n“I was shocked when Vladdy hit a home run against him, and Vladdy is Vladdy,” Perdomo said, referring to Toronto Blue Jays star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. “With runners on base, he’s quick to the plate. Your timing has to be quick.”\n\nPerdomo’s comments reflect the intersection of rivalry and admiration that has come to define Ohtani’s presence in MLB. Even as division rivals who play high-intensity games each year at Chase Field and Dodger Stadium, moments like these show how players balance competition with mutual respect through friendly banter and bets.\n\nAug 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Arizona Diamondbacks infielder Geraldo Perdomo scores in the first inning triple against the Cincinnati Reds at Chase Field. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nOhtani’s reach is global. Often portrayed as serious and businesslike, he continues to leave an impact far beyond the field. Even without frequent trips to the desert, being part of a story that connects Arizona to the Dominican Republic underscores how his influence stretches across cultures and borders.\n\nWhile Perdomo may not have his signed Ohtani bat — yet — his respect for the reigning NL MVP serves as a reminder that baseball rivalries often transcend competition and ultimately give way to admiration.\n\n“What Ohtani does, no one else does,” Perdomo said. “As long as he’s playing and keeps putting up the numbers he does, nobody’s going to win an MVP. No one.”\n\n‘His joy is back’: Suns’ Jalen Green makes his long-awaited return in Philly",

    "fullText": "Manchester United will part ways with star midfielder Casemiro at the end of the current campaign, creating a gaping hole at the heart of Michael Carrick’s engine room.\n\nDespite his occasional ups and downs since joining the club from Real Madrid in the summer of 2022, the 33-year-old has quickly become one of the fan favourites at Old Trafford.\n\nUnited paid Los Merengues a whopping £60 million to sign the five-time UEFA Champions League winner, while handing the player an eye-watering £350,000-a-week contract.\n\nHowever, it paid off as Casemiro helped the Red Devils lift the 2023 League Cup trophy with a match-winning performance before guiding them to the 2024 FA Cup triumph.\n\nCasemiro’s tenacity and combative nature, combined with a knack for scoring decisive goals, have turned him into a cornerstone of Man Utd’s midfield in recent seasons.\n\nUnfortunately, the time has come for the Brazil captain to wave goodbye to the Theatre of Dreams, with the player announcing his departure at the end of the season.\n\nWith the former Madrid stalwart on his way out, it’s up to the club to find a suitable successor, a challenge made even tougher by the pressure of securing a top-four finish.\n\nHere, we look at five potential replacements for the Old Trafford faithful’s cult hero.\n\nDespite Atalanta’s notable downfall in the wake of Gian Piero Gasperini’s departure, Ederson remains one of the most highly rated midfielders in Serie A.\n\nInter Milan had tried to lure him away from Bergamo last summer but to no avail, as La Dea’s £55m asking price blew the Nerazzurri out of the water, opening the door for a potential Premier League move.\n\nAt 26, Ederson is at his peak powers, but it’s questionable whether he would be a fitting candidate to fill Casemiro’s shoes despite their shared nationality and similar styles of play.\n\nEven the bookmakers view the former Salernitana man as an outsider in the race to replace the Brazilian veteran in Manchester.\n\nEmerging as a household name at Crystal Palace, Adam Wharton is one of the most sought-after midfielders on the market, with a queue of clubs eager to acquire his services.\n\nPriced at 15/2 to join Man Utd in the summer, Wharton has generated plenty of interest, as Real Madrid and Liverpool are also hot on his trail, with Tottenham Hotspur lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe 21-year-old has become famous for his tactical intelligence and elegance, and there’s no doubt that he would be an immediate upgrade on United’s current midfield options.\n\nPalace could be inclined to let him leave for a reported fee of £65m.\n\nNottingham Forest’s first European season in the 21st century has plunged the club’s domestic campaign into chaos, with the Tricky Trees languishing in the Premier League’s lower reaches since the opening weekend.\n\nWhile things have not gone their way, Elliot Anderson remains a rare shining light at the City Ground, as the 23-year-old continues to impress with his energy, technical quality and willingness to take responsibility in midfield.\n\nAnderson is already an established Premier League star and is likely to play a prominent role for England at the upcoming FIFA World Cup after becoming a first-team regular for Thomas Tuchel’s side.\n\nMeanwhile, several English clubs have taken note of his progress in West Bridgford, with Chelsea and Manchester City reportedly set to rival Man Utd for his services.\n\nThe former Newcastle United ace won’t come cheap, with Forest slapping a prohibitive £100m price tag on their most prized asset.\n\nCasemiro’s exit could lure the Carrington academy graduate, James Garner, back to his boyhood club after an impressive four-year stint at Everton, where he has established himself as an elite midfielder.\n\nWhile the Toffees are desperate to tie the 24-year-old down to a new long-term contract, a call from Man Utd could throw a spanner in the works, though the Red Devils must act quickly.\n\nIn addition to United, Aston Villa and Newcastle are also interested in the Englishman, who has made 22 league appearances for David Moyes’ side this season, racking up two goals and three assists.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting name on United’s shortlist is that of Eduardo Camavinga, who could be counting his final months at Stadio Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nLow in the pecking order, Camavinga is ready to pack his bags, with Chelsea emerging as his potential destination amid Madrid’s alleged interest in Enzo Fernandez, via El Nacional.\n\nHowever, Man Utd could spoil the Blues’ hopes of including the Frenchman in a high-profile swap deal now that they desperately need a long-term solution in the middle of the park.\n\nArticle republished with permission from OldTraffordFaithful.com.",

    "title": "Fiorentina vs Cagliari: Preview",
    "description": "The Viola try to make it 5 straight without defeat, which is a small goal but also one that was unthinkable a month ago.",
    "fullText": "Fiorentina has a chance to haul itself out of the relegation places at the expense of a rival for the drop this weekend when Cagliari (15th place with 22 points) comes to town, although the Sardinians are coming off a high following a win over Juventus last time out. The match will be played on Saturday, 24 January 2026, at 17:00 GMT/12:00 PM EST, at the Stadio Artemio Franchi in beautiful Firenze. The forecast calls for a fairly warm evening but potentially a rainy one.\n\nOne of the best dynamics over the past month or so has been the Paris-Dodô pairing on the right. They’ve regularly swapped positions and roles, with either one happy jetting infield while the other holds the width, and their mind meld has given opposing defenses a lot of headaches. Manor Solomon—the obvious replacement now that Parisi’s out for a couple weeks with a hamstring issue—probably won’t have that level of chemistry with Dodô right away, and as a right-footed player, he might not be as comfortable cutting inside.\n\nTo replicate Parisi’s impact, Solomon has two main tasks (you know, besides playing well). The first is to offer Dodô some cover. The fullback has been back to his best over the past few weeks, raiding forward to great effect, and that requires the winger ahead of him to sacrifice at times. If Solomon stays high and wide, it will fall to Rolando Mandragora to shuffle into that space, where Cagliari will target him on the break with the more athletic Semih Kiliçsoy. It’s not the funnest thing for a winger but the defensive side will be important.\n\nThe second task is width. Because Parisi’s left-footed, he naturally turns towards the center of the pitch. In contrast, the Solomon might stick to going down the line. If that’s the case, keeping him higher up out of possession might be a viable strategy to stretch Cagliari’s defense horizontally and open space for Roberto Piccoli. Part of Dodô‘s recent improvement has been Parisi opening space for the overlap, so if Solomon’s always hugging the touchline, Dodô will have to cut infield a lot. He can do that to good effect but he’s best in the wide areas, particularly in the final third.\n\nI harp on this ahead of every game and end up disappointed every time. Fiorentina has conceded 10 of 32 goals from set pieces, which is the highest proportion in Serie A. While that may seem to have improved of late, it’s more about opponent finishing than any improvements in that area. Part of it is that the Viola defense is just bad in the air (2nd-most headed goals conceded). Part of it is David de Gea staying glued to his line at all times rather than coming for the ball.\n\nMarin Pongračić (much improved of late in general) is curiously bad in the air, which means the only average-to-above average aerial defenders on the team are Pietro Comuzzo, Robin Gosens, and maybe Cher Ndour and Roberto Piccoli. That’s a personnel issue which Paolo Vanoli can’t fix with any amount of drilling. He can try to minimize fouls in dangerous areas but that’s mitigation rather than solution. Maybe a radically different defensive strategy is the fix: instead of sitting deep in the box, for example, push everyone higher up and disrupt opponents’ timing at set pieces. That’s one example. There are other options too. But something’s got to change.\n\nI love Yerry Mina because he’s a box office defender, bursting at the seams with personality and always up to something. I’m sorry it didn’t work out in Florence for him but at least he gave everyone (except Josh Zirkzee’s nipple) some memories. He’s the sort of lumbering, lovable defender that always endears themselves to a fan base for his willingness to enact violence and his humor in doing so.\n\nAnd here, he’ll be up against Albert Guðmundsson. I can’t think of a greater contrast in physical force and I’m intrigued to see how it pans out: Guðmundsson’s quick enough to run circles around him but Mina could simply overpower the Viola winger. Either way, expect the big Colombian to go deep into his bag of tricks to deal with a speedier, wispier opponent.\n\nThe bookies lean towards Fiorentina pretty heavily, from what I can tell. In fact, I’d say too heavily, given the relative positions in the table. Cagliari’s coming off a massive win and is the exact sort of team that gives the Viola trouble. I don’t want to dismiss the momentum Vanoli and company have built up over the past month but the team still feels very fragile to me. The hosts are certainly favorites but those odds are tilted towards them too much if you’re actually planning to bet real money.\n\nI’m not so I predict a 2-1 Fiorentina win. Cagliari leads Serie A in yellow cards and is 2nd in total fouls so don’t expect a beautiful game as the visitors sit deep and try to counter attack. I feel like we’re due a Mandragora banger so I’ll tap him for the opener, with Gosens adding a second with a header. Facing a 2-goal deficit, Fabio Pisacane will throw on an extra striker and the Viola will wilt under the bombardment, eventually conceding late to Mina (of course) to set up a tense finish. With both Andrea Belotti and Michael Folorunsho out, though, the Sardinians won’t have enough reti di ex to tie it up.",

    "description": "Jason Williams inbox: Baltimore and Buffalo fired highly successful coaches. Does it make Bengals look worse for sticking with Zac Taylor?",
    "fullText": "Ask columnist Jason Williams anything − sports or non-sports – and he’ll pick some of your questions and comments from his inbox and respond on Cincinnati.com. Email: jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nMessage: John Harbaugh won a Super Bowl in Baltimore. He won eight road playoff games over 18 seasons there, something no other coach has done. He still got fired.\n\nSean McDermott made Buffalo a regular contender in the AFC, at one point going six straight seasons of winning at least one playoff game. He still got fired.\n\nAnd yet Zac Taylor remains the Bengals’ head coach after missing the playoffs three straight years. Don’t you think all these firings of top coaches makes the Bengals look even worse for keeping Zac?\n\nReply: Guess it depends on the audience. It looks bad to the national media, which can’t accept that the Bengals aren’t like everyone else in how they operate. Here at home, we’re conditioned to accept Bengals mediocrity and so most people don’t think it looks all that bad.\n\nBig picture, the moves in Baltimore and Buffalo highlight that the Bengals’ standards aren’t congruent with the AFC’s elite franchises. You already knew that, but it’s just another reminder that some teams have a whole other level of expectations – a level that’s hard to comprehend around here.\n\nBaltimore and Buffalo are legitimately trying to win a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Bengals ownership is happy if the team is competitive and finishes with a winning record. Did you notice that Bengals owner Mike Brown pointed out the “four straight winning seasons” in the first sentence of his statement early this month? Well, two of those ended with no playoff berth.\n\nThat said, I’m glad Taylor didn’t get fired. The team’s failures aren’t his fault. Taylor can only do so much with the inadequate players that ownership and the front office keep giving him.\n\nAnd there is something to be said about being patient with a coach. It’s a tough balancing act, but Taylor did oversee the best two-year stretch in team history – and it wasn’t that long ago.\n\nThe notion of firing a coach after one bad season is crazy, like the Ravens did with Harbaugh. On one hand, you like the message that mediocrity won’t cut it. On the other, though, it’s a cautionary tale to be careful what you wish for. It’ll be incredibly difficult for new Baltimore coach Jesse Minter to match Harbaugh’s success, let alone top it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Baltimore, Buffalo go for Super Bowl excellence as Bengals stay same",

    "fullText": "Editor’s note: This article contains spoilers for each series of the UK and U.S. editions of The Traitors\n\nThe winner of the fourth series of Traitors UK will not be the psychologist, either of the two barristers — one turned bestselling crime author — or the retired police detective.\n\nThe wild irony of The Traitors, the final of which will be aired on the BBC this evening, is that a social deduction game based around reading people, gathering evidence, and presenting a case never seems to favour people who have spent a career building those skills.\n\nThe aforementioned detective got the whole thing so spectacularly wrong that the only player she pledged her trust to was a traitor.\n\nHow can you look away? Almost 12 million people watched the series four premiere in the UK this month, and the U.S. fourth season has already beaten the premiere of season three. Outwardly, Traitors is a game of deception — the titular ‘traitors’ must eliminate the ‘faithfuls’, by murder and manipulation, while faithfuls must hunt out the traitors and vote to banish them — but it is really a proving ground for every soft skill ever listed on LinkedIn.\n\nEach year, contestants from scores of different industries — diplomacy, medicine, politics, military, teaching — profess theirs has equipped them best to succeed on a show which offers a cash prize to the winning contestant. Which raises the question: how well would football prepare you for the Traitors?\n\nThere are parallels between both, according to Traitors UK series one contestant Dr Amos Ogunkoya, a GP and sports medicine doctor who was previously the club doctor at Luton Town (then in the Premier League) and Colchester United.\n\n“When you’re in the castle, there’s so much noise,” he told The Athletic. “Everyone is throwing out theories. (The edit) focuses on one or two, but there are 10, 30, 50 every day.\n\n“You have to trust your gut a lot more. When you’re working in the Premier League, I can’t explain to you how much noise there is. It’s global noise, and inside, everyone’s got people in their ear. Comfort in that noise and comfort in who you are is really important.\n\n“Football environments are difficult things because, especially at the higher level, they induce — quite similar to The Traitors — a level of paranoia. For a lot of people at the top level, there’s a lot of competition: is (there) someone else in the shadows that wants to take that position from you? The people who rise to the top tend to be the people whom people like.\n\n“The best faithfuls are the ones who adopt the siege mentality. It’s almost like a relegation scrap: ‘We know who we are, and everyone thinks we’re stupid, and everyone thinks we’re gonna go down’. That’s the best way you quickly suss out who’s on your side. I probably got murdered because I was (valuing) cohesion and leadership.”\n\nSuch is the cruelty of The Traitors, the game does not always reward those players the audience perceives as having worked the hardest.\n\nContestants must constantly walk the tightrope between self-preservation and confrontation. Some, like faithful Harriet in UK series 4, swiftly go in two-footed with their accusations, while others hide their suspicions from the traitors to stay in the game. That exercise in diplomacy — how and when to speak — takes place every day in dressing rooms up and down the country.\n\n“Sometimes, there’s no other option other than to go for someone and really say: ‘That’s not on, you’re not behaving in the right way’,” said Wales Women centurion Helen Ward, now head of women’s football at Watford. “You have to bring it up, particularly if you are captain or head coach. You’ve got a responsibility to the rest of the group to call it out.\n\n“I’ve really been lucky to have some brilliant team-mates, but there’s always the occasion where you think: what are they doing behind my back? If it’s another striker, are they trying to bring me down to other people to make themselves look better?\n\n“There’s competition for places, but then there’s being a little bit sneaky about it.\n\n“You know they’re doing things to elevate their own career, and that maybe comes with some behaviours that not everybody would necessarily agree with or do themselves. That certainly would come up from time to time in teams. If you’ve been around that and you’ve picked up on things that people do when they think no one’s watching, that could be a trait that lends itself well to solving The Traitors.”\n\nJake Brown, winner of UK series three, attributed his victory in part to skills gained as a Para Lion with the England cerebral palsy football team. Brown represented England at European and world championships and trained at England’s base at St George’s Park in Staffordshire. That ingrained consistency was crucial in the show, he said.\n\n“If you change your behaviour or character a lot, that’s often seen as traitor behaviour,” he said. “I always used to think: one day, be loud; one day, be quiet. I was trying to get that see-saw balance.\n\n“One of my managers at England used to tell me: ‘KISS — Keep it simple, stupid’. I took that saying into the castle with me. The first couple of days: don’t do anything complicated. Normally, the first thing you think about is the best. That saying goes on the football pitch: the first pass or the first action you see is normally the best course of action.\n\n“When people start to get banished and murdered, that’s when you need to think outside the box, and think a couple of days ahead. If I say this, how will people react? If you’re saying something without a long-term goal in mind, you might get caught out.”\n\nCoaches and managers, of course, must be alert to the moment the courage of their convictions tips into delusion. By the same token, the most galling reverse came in the UK final of The Celebrity Traitors. Ted Lasso star Nick Mohammed formed an early alliance with former England rugby union player Joe Marler based on their shared suspicions of comedian and traitor Alan Carr, only to falter and banish Marler at the final round table in favour of Carr.\n\n“My jaw dropped when that happened,” said Jay Sadler, the head coach of WSL 2 side Portsmouth Women. “I couldn’t believe he changed and switched on someone that he formed an alliance with.\n\n“Elite managers have that strength in their convictions and they know exactly what they’re chasing. Sometimes, you look and think, do we stick? Do we need to have more adaptability to win? I’d rather look back and be glad I made a bold move that I felt strategically was the right one than stick with the same, hoping for a different result.\n\n“The difference is I’ve got a multidisciplinary team that I can lean on — analysts and assistant coaches that I know are here for the right reasons. Can you trust everyone on The Traitors? That’s why I think you have to be a little bit more cut-throat with sticking to your own game and your own guns than in football. If you are going off limited information, stick to what you know and stick to your gut.”\n\nThe most galling example of misplaced trust came in the UK series two finale, when disability model Mollie Pearce’s friendship with traitor and eventual winner Harry Clark won out over a more logical alliance with faithful Jaz Singh.\n\n“The interesting thing is they all think, after being together for three or four days, that they know each other inside out,” said Stephen Warnock, the former Liverpool and Blackburn defender turned BBC and Sky pundit.\n\n“You haven’t got a clue who you’re talking to, but people do get blinkers on and forget it’s a game. That’s the one thing that footballers would definitely remember, and I think they’d be quite cut-throat if it meant axing someone or calling someone out. The other side of it is if you had someone who is an ex-captain or a senior player going into the Traitors, they could be seen as a little bit bossy, commanding and trying to lead people. That could be seen as a positive or a negative.”\n\nWarnock pointed out that footballers may have years together compared to the weeks Traitors contestants spend in the Scottish castle. That makes for a more delicate and significant balancing of emotions. Equally, football coaches tread a constant line: building an honest environment while protecting the group, which sometimes necessitates a kind of deception.\n\n“What I’ve learned now is that football management is a bit like acting,” continued Sadler. “You’re going up in front of the cameras and the media want to talk to you, but you already know what you want to tell them — you just manipulate whatever questions are asked and give the answer that you want to portray to the players, staff, and stakeholders.\n\n“The biggest thing in leadership is being honest and being able to build trust. Deception kind of conflicts with that. (In the game), the balance will be key.”\n\nIt is rare that a post-game interview will be as confrontational as a Traitors roundtable, but journalists must be able to ask the hard questions while preserving long-term relationships.\n\n“With football, you know it is just a game, but when it starts getting nasty, or things aren’t going their way, (managers) are still people, so it’s a fine line to tread,” said Sky Sports presenter Michelle Owen.\n\n“(With) The Traitors, I can’t believe this year how there have been so many things (discussed at the roundtable) and then the next day, no one mentions them. You need to bank stuff in your memory. In our job, those little things are so important.”\n\nUltimately, though, The Traitors remains such a difficult show to navigate. Everyone thinks they’re good at reading people until somebody proves them wrong — a bad business partner, a dishonest spouse — and those instincts are tested in a game whose premise often feels illogical.\n\n“You have to be comfortable being wrong,” said Ogunkoya, which sums up the irony of the game. “In any professional sport, you make mistakes, adjust and you don’t have an ego when it comes to it. People can go in (the show) and think they’re good at reading people, become really rigid, and that makes them easy to trick.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSoccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs remain one of the most impressive teams this season. On Thursday, they got their 31st win of the season on the back of a well-rounded night against the Utah Jazz.\n\nHead coach Mitch Johnson is glad to see how the team is performing, especially with Keldon Johnson serving as a leader. The 26-year-old forward has been with the team since 2019, making him the team's longest-tenured active player.\n\nWhile Johnson is still young at 26, he has become a huge figurehead in San Antonio. Most of the players look up to him as a leader because he has a good demeanor about him, but he has a naturally friendly personality.\n\nThat was most evident when he agreed to shave his head alongside Victor Wembanyama. It has been an interesting season for the Spurs, and that is mostly due to Wembanyama's excellence, but Johnson's leadership should not be discounted.\n\nMORE:Victor Wembanyama was glad he and Spurs teammate Keldon Johnson shaved their heads\n\nCoach Johnson has also been with the team for a long time, despite this being his second season at the helm. Throughout the years together, the head coach has seen Keldon develop into a reliable player and leader.\n\n\"Keldon is a prime example for every player, but especially young player, kids out there that he's making as many mistakes as everybody,\" Mitch said about Keldon after beating the Jazz.\n\n\"But his energy and his effort and his competitiveness and his multiple efforts to get to the next thing is at such a high level that it allows him to find a rhythm and find himself in the middle of plays.\"\n\nWith that kind of reliability, it makes sense that Keldon continues to be one of the most important players on the Spurs roster. He might not have eye-popping stats, but he has an intrinsic value on the Spurs roster.\n\nMoving forward, the rest of the Spurs will continue to progress. They will know that Keldon Johnson will be quite a reliable player and presence for the team.\n\nSpurs' Victor Wembanyama stats since shaving head bald are pretty much unstoppable\n\nWhy Wemby is bald after shaving head with Spurs teammate\n\nVictor Wembanyama responds to Anthony Edwards wish to dunk on him one day\n\nSpurs former lottery pick cited as potential trade candidate\n\nSpurs fans think Victor Wembanyama recruited Giannis Antetokounmpo live on camera because of a misleading post",

    "description": "Specific Washington Commanders' jerseys are on clearance, which means the old look could become the permanent new look.",
    "fullText": "Thanks to quarterback Jayden Daniels, it became cool to buy Washington Commanders NFL jerseys in 2024. Every time the NFL released a different Daniels' jersey, whether it was the black alternate, the new Super Bowl era jerseys they brought back in 2025, or Salute to Service, they were a big hit.\n\nNow, if you're looking to buy a Daniels' jersey — or any Washington jersey outside of the Super Bowl era throwbacks, you can find them on clearance.\n\nNo, it's not because the Commanders were 5-12 in 2025. Or because fans are still protesting over the name. Instead, it's because Washington's current jerseys will be going away in 2026. The Super Bowl-era throwbacks will likely become the Commanders' permanent uniforms.\n\nX user Zach Cohen often posts on NFL uniforms and designs and released the following video on Thursday:\n\nLet's do this one better... only 4 NFL teams have similarly discounted jerseys on all current players online & in-person at Dick's 🚨\n- Commanders: all except white \"throwbacks\"\n- Falcons: all except black throwbacks\n- Ravens: all \n- Titans: all\n\nNot only are those 4 teams I… https://t.co/kAR7LXDwVB pic.twitter.com/5EIqAMYsd4\n\n— Zach Cohen (@ZachCohenFB) January 22, 2026\n\nCohen is often spot-on when reporting about jerseys and uniforms. And he's right about the discounted price on Commanders' jerseys on Fanatics.\n\nThe Commanders' jerseys were introduced in 2022 when they changed their name. They've never been popular. The jerseys, specifically the burgundy and the black jerseys, were more popular than the white ones. Still, most fans longed for something resembling the franchise's historic past. That's why the Super Bowl-era uniforms were introduced in 2025.\n\nThe longstanding rumor is that these uniforms will become permanent in 2026. The Commanders would also introduce a burgundy jersey resembling the ones they wore as the Redskins. That would explain why each of the jerseys introduced in 2022 is on clearance: they could be going away.\n\nSo, if you want to find a Jayden Daniels or Terry McLaurin jersey, now could be the time.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Clearance jerseys are good news for throwbacks",

He made a significant impact, scoring 24 points in a 112-104 win over the Los Angeles Lakers at the Intuit Center on Thursday night.\n\nLeonard came into Thursday's game averaging a career-high 28.9 points while playing in 30 of the Clippers' 43 games. He had scored a combined 68 points versus the Washington Wizards and Charlotte Hornets in the two games he played before sitting out with his injury. Leonard played 25 minutes, shooting 9-for-19 (and 3-of-7 on 3-pointers) from the floor.\n\nKawhi doing Kawhi things 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/WRH7eWx4JW\n\n— LA Clippers (@LAClippers) January 23, 2026\n\nThe Clippers held a 79-53 lead midway through the third quarter after an Ivica Zubac dunk. From there, however, the Lakers chipped away at that 26-point margin with a 19-7 run to end the frame. That became a 34-14 run that trimmed the Clippers' lead to 93-85 by the 7:40 mark of the fourth quarter.\n\nA Luka Dončić fadeaway 3-pointer with Kris Dunn guarding him moved the Lakers to within 93-91 with 5:56 remaining. But James Harden countered with a 3 of his own to finally stop the Lakers' momentum and steady the Clippers. John Collins followed with a layup and Zubac hit two free throws to restore the Clippers' lead back to 100-91 with under four minutes to play.\n\nLUKA DONCIC. \n\nOUT OF THIS WORLD. pic.twitter.com/mn8yi1zSqY\n\n— Italo Santana (@BulletClubIta) January 23, 2026\n\nClippers coach Ty Lue then won a big replay challenge, arguing that a foul on Jordan Miller should instead be ruled a loose ball foul on the Lakers' Marcus Smart. Lue won the challenge, which took two free throws away from Smart and awarded them to Miller because the Lakers were in the penalty. Miller made one of the two free throws, but that gave the Clippers a 10-point lead.\n\nYet the Lakers fought back again with LeBron James getting a fast-break dunk and Smart turning a Miller turnover into a jumper. Leonard committed another turnover, losing the ball out of bounds, and that led to a Jarred Vanderbilt dunk to cut the Clippers' lead to 103-99.\n\nFollowing two free throws by Zubac, James was fouled on a layup and made the subsequent free throw for a 3-point play to pull the Lakers to within 105-102. But Zubac followed with a reverse dunk and Collins hit a 3-pointer after Rui Hachimura missed a long-range shot of his own. That was the dagger, giving the Clippers a 110-102 lead with 43 seconds remaining.\n\nDoncic finished with a game-high 32 points, but shot 11-of-27 from the floor (including 3-of-13 on 3s). He added 11 rebounds and 8 assists. James scored 23 points after tallying only 9 at halftime. But he also shot 9-of-19 while grabbing 5 rebounds and dishing out 6 assists.\n\nThe Lakers' loss dropped them to 26-17 and the No. 6 spot in the Western Conference, behind the Houston Rockets and Phoenix Suns. Up next, they visit the Dallas Mavericks (19-26) for a nationally televised prime-time matchup Saturday on ABC. The Mavs have won four in a row and five of their past six games.\n\nFor the Clippers, Zubac scored 18 points with 19 rebounds while Harden also scored 18 and notched 10 assists. Altogether, seven Clippers reached double figures in scoring. The win was the Clippers' 14th in their past 17 games and improved their record to 20-24, good for 10th place in the West. They're off until Sunday, when they host the Brooklyn Nets (12-30).",

    "description": "Despite Draisaitl's return, the Oilers suffered a swift defeat, with McDavid admitting the team's puck play is \"real, real bad.\"",
    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Penguins struck first and struck quickly on Thursday night. If that wasn't bad enough, they did so two more times in 35 seconds to take a 3-0 lead in the first three minutes of a game that the Edmonton Oilers should have wanted to start well in, if for no other reason than their starting goaltender was playing his old team.\n\nAnthony Mantha scored both goals, and neither was Tristan Jarry's fault. Sidney Crosby scored seconds later with a beautiful tip from the slot, easily winning the head-to-head battle against Connor McDavid, who, by his own admission, wasn't very good.\n\nJarry was hung out to dry, and McDavid's offense wasn't there to save the day.\n\nInjury Update: Will Mattias Ekholm Make It to The Olympics After All?\n\nThe Oilers' Trade Deadline Dilemma: Maybe the Answer Is Already Here\n\nPodkolzin's Fight Shows What The Oilers Are Missing\n\nThree goals in four shots was not the way the Oilers wanted to start after two brutally flat periods the game before against the New Jersey Devils.\n\nThe disaster against the Penguins was another embarrassing start for the Oilers. They began to push back in the latter half of the period, eventually outshooting the Penguins 13-9, but they couldn't sustain things, and their puck management remained an issue.  It remained a problem all night, and the Oilers eventually lost 6-2.\n\nMcDavid said the game wasn't on Jarry. Too many Grade-A looks again, he noted. That included an easy tip-in and a breakaway. \"Obviously not ideal, not a great start. Playing catch-up is tough in this league, and you look pretty bad when you're doing it.\"\n\nWhen asked about when this Oilers team needs to flip the switch that everyone is waiting on them to flip: \"30 games left, we're coming down the home stretch here. There's no February this year. Our sense of urgency has got to go up in our group.\"\n\nMcDavid added, \"The playoff race is really tight. We've got to find a way to get points here, especially at home.\"\n\nAs mentioned earlier, McDavid was the first to admit he wasn't very good. In back-to-back games, he's not gotten a point. \"It starts with me; my last two were probably not my best. I can be better,\" he said. \"When I'm better, the whole group usually responds. So that starts there.\"\n\nThe problem is that the Oilers, as a group, are flat.\n\nIt's clear to everyone, including the Oilers' captain, that there's an issue. \"It can even start in practice, I thought our puck play has been real bad. Real, real bad,\" McDavid said. \"We're not really connecting on passes. When we do, it's kind of sloppy, bouncing, whatever it is. When we're playing that way, we look slow and clunky. I thought we've looked that way for the last two games.\"\n\n\"Yeah, he's absolutely right,\" Knoblauch said. \"Some nights you're not feeling it, but after a certain amount of time, a long stretch, then you have to change something.\" Knoblauch agreed, \"The last two games, the puck play has been horrendous. We've given up a lot of chances.\"\n\nAs for the urgency, that's one of two things, the coach said. First, the players find it within themselves to play harder and find a way, or second, \"the coach just chooses the guys who are playing with that urgency and can dictate ice time.\"\n\nWhen it came to the three goals in 37 seconds, \"Obviously, giving up three goals in the first three minutes is not good. We weren't ready.\"\n\nJarry didn't have his best game, but he certainly wasn't the problem. The parade of chances against meant this game could have been 8 or 9 goals against if not for some big saves.\n\nWhen it came to the Oilers letting Jarry down, \"Very disappointing, especially for Jarry,\" said Knoblauch. \"How many breakaways, two-on-ones, Grade-A scoring chances... You look at the shots against, and it looks bad, six goals on 21 shots, but the type of chances we gave up, it was not an easy night for our goaltender.\"\n\nJarry spoke after the game, too.\n\n\"It's tough, just managing the puck. It's key for any team. Our puck management tonight hurt us a little bit,\" said Jarry. He admitted he wanted to beat his old team, but three goals against in 37 seconds made that difficult.\n\n\"I think it's just being on the same page. Some of the turnovers and some of the missed plays, if we clean that up, it puts us on the better side of things more times than not.\"\n\nKnoblauch said the game shouldn't just be on McDavid or the goaltender. \"That's where our team needs to step up, not necessarily scoring goals, but better team defense where we can win games 2-1, rather than having to score four or five to win.\"\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more. Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "fullText": "United States forward Trinity Rodman has signed a new three-year deal with the National Women's Soccer League's Washington Spirit that will reportedly make her the world's highest-paid woman footballer.\n\nThe Spirit announced the signing in a statement on Thursday, calling it \"one of the most significant contracts in the NWSL and the women's game worldwide, reflecting both Rodman's elite status and the Spirit's role as a global standard-bearer in women's soccer.\"\n\nESPN and The Athletic reported the deal is worth more than $2 million annually, including bonuses.\n\nHer agent, Mike Senkowski of Upper 90 Sports Group, told both outlets it will make her the highest-paid female player in the world.\n\nRodman, daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, was drafted at the age of 18 in 2021 and earned Rookie of the Year honors as the Spirit won their first NWSL title.\n\nShe has won Olympic gold, and while the Spirit fell in the past two NWSL title matches, the club has made retaining her a priority.\n\n\"I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,\" Rodman said in a statement. \"I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed.\n\n\"We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.\"\n\nThe path to re-sign Rodman, whose previous contract expired on December 31, hasn't been smooth.\n\nA four-year deal that would have paid Rodman significantly \n\nThe NWSL Players Association responded by filing a grievance against the league on Rodman's behalf.\n\nIn December, the league's board of governors approved the creation of a new High Impact Player rule, allowing teams to spend up to $1 million beyond the salary cap on certain stars in a bid to keep them in the league.\n\nESPN had reported that Rodman had offers from overseas clubs, notably in England.\n\n\"Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly, she represents the future of this club and the future of women's soccer,\" Spirit owner Michele Kang said. \"This agreement reflects our belief that elite talent deserves elite commitment.\"",

    "description": "Pace and Pensacola Catholic girls soccer advanced to their respective district finals to lead Jan. 22's district soccer tournament action.",
    "fullText": "District soccer tournaments continued Thursday. Two area teams advanced to district finals, while at least one saw it's season come to an end in the district semifinals.\n\nBelow is a recap of tonight's action.\n\nNo. 1 Fort Walton Beach 5, No. 4 West Florida 0\n\nThe Vikings (11-4-3 overall) led 4-0 at halftime and will host No. 2 Wakulla in the District 1-4A championship on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m.\n\nWest Florida (5-11-2) is eliminated from the district tournament but has likely done enough to advance to the Region 1-4A tournament. The Jaguars entered the district tournament ranked No. 6 in Region 1-4A and the second to last team in the eight-team field.\n\nNo. 2 Pace 2, No. 3 Navarre 2 (Pace advances 4-2 on penalty kicks)\n\nPace senior goalie Zoey Mattes discussed the exact moment with her teammates on the bus ride to Ashton Brosnaham Park.\n\nIf the Patriots went to penalty kicks, she was taking one. Right before the shootout, she decided she would take the one that ended it.\n\nAfter watching her teammates convert three of Pace’s first four penalty kicks and Navarre put two of its four wide, her prediction came true. She sent the ball high and right and into the back of the net to send the Patriots to their second district championship game in the last three years.\n\nPace (11-4) will play No. 1 Niceville in the District 1-6A championship on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m. at Ashton Brosnaham Park. The winner will clinch an automatic berth in the Region 1-6A tournament, though both teams have done enough to clinch an at-large bid if they don’t win a district title.\n\nNavarre (10-8-2) is eliminated and will wait to see if it makes the regional tournament. The Raiders entered the district tournament ranked No. 8 in the region.\n\n“It’s nice that it was me finishing out the game,” Mattes said. “I didn’t rely on anyone else. Obviously my teammates made there’s before, but it was nice knowing that I had this place to stake that I’m here and I’m going to finish this out for my team.”\n\nMattes was experiencing much different emotions about 90 minutes earlier, when Pace went into the locker room at halftime trailing 2-0.\n\nRaiders sophomore Kylyn Shawaryn scored her teams first goal in the ninth minute, then senior Emma Barry doubled the lead four minutes later. Navarre outworked Pace in the first half, with Mattes imploring her teammates to play with more energy.\n\nMattes and junior Kylin Williamson worked to get the squad's energy back up, and the Patriots found a spark early in the second half. Katelyn Borchik put home a rebound off a corner kick in the 48th minute to cut the lead in half.\n\n10 minutes later, Williamson’s free kick bounced off the crossbar and inside the goal line to tie the game. Pace forced overtime despite being without their top goalscorer, senior forward Sydney Crow, who is competing this weekend with the US Youth Soccer Olympic Development Program South Region Team at the Interregional Games in Orlando.\n\n“They believed that we could win and they kept fighting,” Pace head coach Nick Williamson said. “We got some great leaders on this team and they stepped up for each other, but also our bench was deep and they absolutely supported each other. It was a good team win for us and couldn’t be more proud.”\n\nMattes did her best to keep Navarre off the board from there, including a wild sequence late in the second half where she made a diving save on a free kick, then stopped a follow up shot while still on the ground.\n\nSkill that comes from training she does with Coastal Rush outside of Pace soccer practice. During Patriots practices, she’s a field player, which gives Nick Williamson reason to trust her no matter what she does.\n\nThis game, that meant taking the final penalty kick to send Pace to a district final for the second time in three years and likely ensure a Region 1-6A quarterfinal home game.\n\n“I got 100 percent faith in that kid,” Nick Williamson said. “I don’t care where she plays. Goal or forward, it doesn’t matter.”\n\nNo. 1 Niceville 6, No. 5 Tate 0\n\nAs Aggies assistant coach Kendall Blackmon saw it, the Eagles did exactly what they needed to do to advance to Tuesday’s District 1-6A final. But not for a lack of trying on Tate’s end.\n\nNiceville led 2-0 before scoring four more goals in the second half. The Eagles (14-1-1) will play No. 2 Pace in the District 1-6A final on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m. at Ashton Brosnaham Park.\n\nTate (13-5-2) is eliminated and its season is over. The Aggies needed to win the district tournament to advance to the Region 1-6A tournament.\n\n“Once you’re down it’s kind of hard to stay (up),” Blackmon said. “But the girls fought the entire game. That’s all I ask for them. I don’t care if we lose as long as they give 110 percent everything.”\n\nNiceville’s Riley Mcinnis put home a rebound off a corner kick for the Eagles first goal in the 15th minute, then Molly Johnson doubled the lead 11 minutes later. Abbey Kuritz, Payten Hart, Michelle Melancon and Jezlyn Nelson all scored goals in the second half.\n\nTate finishes this year with its most wins in a season since 2016. The Aggies didn’t make history like they did last year with their first regional appearance since 2007, but the five graduating seniors were a part of that group that raised expectations for the program.\n\nExpectations that next year’s group could reach again. Tate projects to return 78 percent of its goals scored by this year’s team.\n\n“They definitely have had an impact and we’re going to miss them,” Blackmon said. “We’re also a young team. We have a lot of new people and at the end of the day we’re rebuilding. Compared to whenever I played here, it’s night and day.”\n\nNo. 2 Pensacola Catholic 6, No. 3 Freeport 0\n\nThe Crusaders scored five goals in the first half and rolled to their fifth straight district finals appearance.\n\nPensacola Catholic (11-2-3) will play at No. 1 South Walton in the District 1-3A championship on Jan. 27 at 7 p.m.\n\nThe Crusaders beat the Seahawks 2-0 in South Walton on Nov. 5. They'll hit the road again for the district final as the Seahawks are ranked higher in the FHSAA power rankings.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pensacola News Journal: Pace and Pensacola Catholic girls soccer advance to district finals",

    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Kawhi Leonard scored 24 points — his career-high 23rd consecutive game with at least 20 — and the Los Angeles Clippers survived a tight fourth quarter to beat Luka Doncic and the Los Angeles Lakers 112-104 on Thursday night.\n\nThe Clippers have won seven of eight and 14 of 17 as they continue their upward climb from the depths of the Western Conference. Leonard, who missed a stretch when his team had nearly bottomed out in the standings, has a left knee contusion but he didn't sit for long in the fourth.\n\nLeBron James scored 4 points and Doncic hit a 3-pointer to cap a 19-7 run that closed the Lakers within two.\n\nJames Harden answered Doncic's 3 with one of his own as the Clippers ran off 10 in a row to stay in front, 103-91.\n\nBut the Lakers weren't done yet. James hit a jumper and completed a three-point play in an 11-2 run that drew them within three.\n\nIvica Zubac's reverse dunk and John Collins' 3-pointer extended the Clippers' lead to eight points and they closed it out on Harden's pair of free throws.\n\nLuka Doncic had 32 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists and James added 23 points. The Lakers fell to 5-6 in their last 11.\n\nHarden had 18 points and 10 assists and Zubac added 18 points and 19 rebounds for the Clippers, who had seven players in double figures.\n\nLeonard, Harden and Zubac combined to score the Clippers' first 15 points of the third, extending their lead to 26 points — largest of the game.\n\nFrom there, the Lakers outscored them 19-7 to go into the fourth trailing 86-72. James opened the spurt with a 3-pointer and ended it with a huge dunk off Harden's turnover after Doncic chipped in 9 points in the quarter.\n\nThe Clippers dominated the first half, outscoring the Lakers 17-7 — including nine in a row — over the final minutes to go into halftime leading 64-47.\n\nDoncic scored just three of his 17 first-half points in the second quarter when Leonard led the bench against Doncic and James. The Clippers shot 59% from the floor while limiting the Lakers to 42%.\n\nThe Lakers were still without Austin Reaves (calf strain), although coach JJ Redick expects him back soon.\n\nLakers: Visit the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday to open a six-game trip against Doncic's old team.\n\nClippers: Host the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "Swedes and Finns aren’t known to get along, but tonight was different.\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes suffered a hard-fought defeat to the Chicago Blackhawks as they fell in the shootout. It wasn’t for a lack of effort, nor a lack of puck luck, but rather substantial struggles on their power play, which has been red hot as of late. The first goal of the game was shorthanded for the Blackhawks, and despite having four other chances on the man-advantage, Carolina was unable to produce.\n\nWith every goal the Blackhawks put on the board, the Hurricanes answered in kind, as Chicago could not hold the lead for more than 4:40 before the game would be tied again. The first goal came from the stick of Swedish rookie defenseman Joel Nystrom, as the lone apple came from Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi.\n\nNystrom laughed in the locker room at the irony of it, but expressed his gratitude for finally notching his first career NHL goal after dishing 41 shots at goaltenders since he arrived in Raleigh.\n\n“I’m happy to get my first goal, I’ve been waiting for it, it was good,” he said after the game. “Great pass from ‘KK’, and I had a lot of space there, so I just tried to shoot it – and happy to see it went in.”\n\nThe other two goals on Carolina came from Jordan Staal and Jackson Blake, while the Hurricanes played a very physical game. They landed 29 hits, and notably got under the skin of Oliver Moore after his teammate Nick Lardis took a blow from Alexander Nikishin. Moore and Nikishin dropped the gloves as they both engaged in the first fight of their NHL careers. Both were given a five-minute fighting major, though Moore also assessed a minor for roughing.\n\nAlexander Nikishin VS Oliver Moore 🔔🥊\nAfter Alexander Nikishin landed a clean but heavy hit on Nick Lardis, Oliver Moore started swiping and Nikishin and the two dropped the gloves for a quick dust-up\nMoore, who turned 21 today, left the ice for repair#CarolinaCulture… pic.twitter.com/y8OnLnChmk\n\n— Queen of the Puck (@rbarkleyhockey) January 23, 2026\n\nAs the game dragged into overtime, the Hurricanes noticeably struggled to gain puck possession from the hungry Blackhawks, who refused to take their foot off the gas.\n\nThe shootout ran unusually long, as it extended to six rounds through matching goals and failures. However, the final horn of the game sounded in favor of the Blackhawks, as the bruised and battered Moore lit the lamp rather than merely candles on his birthday.\n\nShayne Gostisbehere and Eric Robinson remained out due to injuries.\n\nSean Walker led the team in hits with six, which matched his season high recorded on December 19th and January 16th, both against the Florida Panthers.\n\nFrederik Andersen has played significantly better in his latest stretch of games, which continued tonight. He made 19 saves on 22 shots against and stopped four of six shots faced in the shootout.\n\nK’Andre Miller participated as the fourth of the Hurricanes’ picks for the shootout and came before even Logan Stankoven. It is always odd to see a defenseman go for the extra event, but especially so for one who has only scored four goals on the season. That one was a bit of a head scratcher.\n\nCarolina Hurricanes Game 51: Lines, Notes, and How to Watch vs. Blackhawks\n\nHurricanes Injury Report: Eric Robinson Expected to Miss Time\n\nLet’s Get Physical!

(KSNT) – The Hornets secure the first win of their road trip.\n\nEmporia State picked up an 84-71 win over Northeastern State.\n\nThe Hornets opened up the first, going on an 11-2 scoring run to take an early 15-7 lead. Emporia State would shoot 19-32 from the floor in the first half to edge them to a 47-42 lead at halftime.\n\nThe Riverhawks would go on a deep run, scoring 12 straight points to take a 56-53 lead. The Hornets would creep in on the Riverhawks’ lead, and with less than 8:30 to go in the game, Emporia State would regain the lead and start to separate itself.\n\n“I thought we played really well,” ESU head coach Tom Billeter said. “Even when we lost the lead, I thought we were getting good looks and good shots.”\n\nThe Hornets shot 49.2% from the floor, highlighted by three guys in double figures, including Treyvon Taylor with 21 points and Chris Harris adding 18. Trey Redd had 17 points and 10 assists for a double-double.\n\nThis is the Hornets’ first true road win of the season.\n\nNext up, Emporia State takes on Arkansas-Fort Smith on Jan. 23 at 5:30 p.m.\n\nFor more sports news, click here.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers football coach Curt Cignetti never stays away from practically any topic, especially when it has to do with the success of his football team.\n\nIt was no different after the Hoosiers beat the Miami Hurricanes in the national title game Monday, as they clinched a 16-0 season with a 27-21 triumph. Amid much scrutiny over Cignetti's future in Indiana, he clarified that he will be in Bloomington for the long haul.\n\n“Good question,” Cignetti told reporters, “Because I’ll be dealing with underclassmen going to the NFL tomorrow and who knows what else.

These guys made it happen. Let me tell you, we had some good senior leadership on this team.\"\n\nThat leadership, of course, was led by quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who has become a fan favorite almost overnight, before his fame ultimately skyrocketed after winning the Heisman Trophy.\n\n“But this team was exceptionally close. And I think Fernando had a big part of that, and I think [Pat] Coogan and [Aiden] Fisher and going on the road with some of those guys — the Penn State game, what that did for this team, I can’t measure, when we were down and out and all the odds were against us, Second-and-17, running clock, one minute and 30 [seconds], and all of a sudden we recomposed and found a way to get that done. That was incredible.”\n\nMORE: Joel Klatt opens up about why Indiana football's national title win is 'exceedingly rare'\n\nThere will be a lot of memories to look back on as the years go by.

    "title": "On This Day (23 January 1954) Purdon Makes A Big Impact As Sunderland Trounce Arsenal!",
    "description": "The new signing was making a big impact!",
    "fullText": "In January 1954 Sunderland were struggling towards the lower reaches of the first division table and – as was the perennial solution to any problem at the time – the board splashed the cash to try to resolve it.\n\nThis time, it was Birmingham’s South African born striker Ted Purdon who arrived at Roker – the 23 year old having scored 27 in 64 games since arriving in England four years earlier.\n\nTwo goals in a 5-0 win on his debut against Cardiff City at Roker Park announced his arrival in style; a much needed boost after just two wins in the previous ten games, but next up was a trip to Highbury to face reigning champions Arsenal.\n\nIt would be a tough test, no doubt, but this inconsistent Sunderland team had already beaten the Gunners earlier in the season – a remarkable 7-1 score line giving Bill Murray’s team the two points – and with new signing Purdon in the ranks, and coming off the back of a convincing win over the Bluebirds, confidence was no doubt high.\n\nAnd that confidence was not misplaced, as Sunderland took the lead in what is thought to be the club’s fastest ever goal – Purdon netting after just 10 seconds, with Arsenal not even touching the ball!\n\nIn front of a packed Highbury crowd of more than 60,000 (according to press reports, ‘the Wearsiders are always a big attraction in the capital’), Sunderland kicked off and were in front immediately; Chisholm slipping the ball through to Purdon, who calmly controlled it and slipped the ball past Gunners keeper Kelsey.\n\nThe lads almost made it two moments after, with Chisholm’s shot deflected for a corner, but within six minutes Arsenal were level; Holton scoring from the edge of the box, beating Cowan just under the bar.\n\nBoth sides had opportunities to get into the lead; Lishman missing a good chance for Arsenal, and Shackleton shooting straight at Kelsey. Shack’s chance came from a Purdon knock down, and the recent signing was showing up incredibly well, turning in a lively display and causing the Arsenal defence all manner of problems.\n\nSunderland dictated much of a fast-paced first half, and should have had a penalty when Shackleton was brought down, but while as shaky as Arsenal were at the back, they were dangerous up front, with Lishman causing all manner of problems. Cowan in the Sunderland goal pulled off a couple of big saves to keep the score level, and the teams went in at half time with the score 1-1.\n\nLate in the first half, Tommy Wright had injured himself in a tackle, and with no subs available he went to centre forward, with Shackleton moving to the right wing and Purdon playing inside forward.\n\nArsenal had a couple of dangerous moves, but Sunderland quickly exerted their strength, creating ‘several brilliant attacks’, and ‘quick, first-time passes had the Arsenal defence rocking’.\n\nA richly deserved second goal for the lads arrived just after the hour, and it was Purdon again on the scoresheet. Billy Elliott got the ball into the box after his own surging run had been stopped, and Purdon slid in to just get there ahead of Kelsey and put the ball into the net.\n\nArsenal came back strongly – a terrific goalmouth scramble saw Sunderland just keep the ball out – and moments later it was 3-1; the injured Wright finding himself with only Kelsey to beat, after Purdon had gone past two men with a great run.\n\nA lack of response to the third goal saw the Arsenal crowd of over 60,000 leave in their thousands, and there weren’t too many of them left to see Purdon complete his hat trick to make it 4-1 just before the end, the new signing slotting home after Shackleton’s brilliant cross.\n\nTwo wins and five goals in your first two games. Not a bad way for a new striker to introduce himself!",

    "description": "From Rooney's Plymouth to Xhaka's European push - how far have we come in 12 months?",
    "fullText": "Ahead of Saturday and our return fixture against West Ham, I can’t help but cast my mind back to August 16th 2025. The Stadium of Light was absolutely pulsating and West Ham were the unfortunate souls tasked with welcoming us back to the Premier League. That 3-0 demolition job, with Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor writing their names into the season’s opening chapter, felt like somewhat of a fever dream.\n\nWith the power of retrospect, that win was not simply just the result of adrenaline but was, instead, a statement. It told other teams in this league that we’re not here to make up the numbers.\n\nAs we near the end of January, we’re right in the mix for the European places, sitting comfortably on 33 points.\n\nTwelve months ago, we were in the mire of the Championship, giving tactical mastermind Wayne Rooney and his soon-to-be-doomed Plymouth squad a generous point at our home ground.\n\nFast forward to today, and as we prepare for the return fixture at the Taxpayers’ Stadium on Saturday, the landscape has changed entirely. Had someone told me in that Plymouth game that we would not only be promoted but would then remain unbeaten at home during the first half of a Premier League season, I’d have called for a straitjacket.\n\nWhat Régis Le Bris, along with Kristian Speakman, our recruitment team and the players themselves, have done in half a season is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nFrom the home fixture against West Ham, I feel like we’re in an even stronger position as a team. Gone are the days of the slightly chaotic Championship side. Instead, in its place, is a disciplined, suffocating Premier League unit. Not only that, but the synergy between the players and fans is clear to see.\n\nWhen we fell behind against Crystal Palace, there was no sense of panic or dread. We knew that chances would come.\n\nHitting 33 points before February is truly incredible. It represents a springboard and reflects one of the most exciting periods to be supporting Sunderland AFC. For me, any fear of relegation has been replaced by the genuine, albeit mildly terrifying, prospect of a European tour. Twelve months ago, we were sweating over Championship play-off permutations…\n\nWe head into this weekend sitting in 9th place and only 3 points away from 4th. Saturday isn’t just about three points, though. It’s about doing the double over a struggling West Ham side and providing a clear sign of how far the pendulum has swung. With solid recruitment and relentlessly high expectations driven from Granit Xhaka, we’re demonstrating that we are not just a “plucky” promoted side. Under Régis Le Bris, we’ve found a level of tactical maturity that, frankly, should have taken years to cultivate. This isn’t the same Sunderland of the late 2010s, where we relied upon miracles and had to endure weekly rallying cries. Instead, it’s a tactically astute outfit that has spent the last five months proving every pundit wrong.\n\nThe journey from August 16th to where we are today is remarkable. If the opening day win was a statement, then the last five months have been the proof. I, for one, can’t wait to see where we end up in 12 months.",

    "fullText": "I just caught myself checking this weekend’s Liverpool and Manchester United fixtures to see if we’ll overtake them with a win at West Ham.\n\nI’ve supported Sunderland for over five decades and this season is just crackers in the way it just keeps surprising me.\n\nI survived a massive stroke the day we won the playoff final and am starting to wonder if I actually died and went to heaven.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Alan. Thank you for your letter — and I hope you’re well on the way to a full recovery after your stroke.\n\nIt’s certainly been quite the season for Sunderland so far, and with two positive results in our next two games, we’ll be ideally placed to mount a strong challenge towards the end of the campaign and to finish as highly as we possibly can.\n\nInteresting times to come, for sure!\n\nI just want to draw your attention to a few flaws in the “ticket resale” option, as the Sunderland website stated that gift vouchers could be used on any credit that is in your ticket resale account.\n\nI’ve since been made aware that the gift vouchers aren’t available to be used in the club shop and can only be used on premium gift vouchers or a stadium tour gift voucher — neither of which I intend to use, and I now have credit on my balance which I have no way of using.\n\nHad I known this was the case, I wouldn’t have put my ticket on resale and I doubt I’ll be doing it in the future if this is the case. I found this very misleading, as nowhere on the website does it state that the gift vouchers can only be used on the above items.\n\nIt clearly states “Gift voucher” on the “What can I buy with my credit?” page. The credit can’t be used against season tickets either, if paid via direct debit. What started out as a decent option for supporters now looks to be pointless to the majority of those who use it!\n\nThis has now been changed on the website, with the club basically admitting their mistake of misleading supporters.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Matthew. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nIt seems that there’s clearly been some form of miscommunication on behalf of the club which has led to confusion on this issue, but nowadays, we receive far fewer letters at Roker Report expressing dissatisfaction at customer service standards and the like.\n\nIt does seem to have improved a great deal but this has obviously been an unfortunate one — and hopefully it won’t be repeated.\n\nI’m a New York City guy and I started watching the documentary during Covid.\n\nI fell in love with this team and players like Luke O’Nien, Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson. This was the greatest underdog story and seeing the revival of this team was made so much sweeter because of me first watching that documentary.\n\nI’ve been following the team since then — much to the dismay of my friends that include Arsenal, Spurs and Leeds fans.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, CJ. Thank you for your letter.\n\nIt’s great to hear that you’ve been following Sunderland’s progress and elevation back to the Premier League — and hopefully the Lads can make even more unforgettable memories during the seasons to come!",

    "description": "There are claims from some people that the Premier League is dull this year, but the 0-0 draw can be a fascinating beast",
    "fullText": "The 0-0 draw between Wolves and Newcastle was the second goalless game of the weekend, and the 17th of the season. This is already more than last season, and six more than in the whole of the 2023-24 season.\n\nStalemates are often dull and are usually examples of strikers having off days or goalkeepers having a blinder. This is true for most of them, but the context of these games is so important. \n\nSunderland have been involved in three 0-0 draws so far this season, away at Crystal Palace and Brighton, and then at home to Man City. From our perspective, all three have been rewarding and were achieved thanks to back-to-the-wall defending and plenty of grit.\n\nThe Palace game was only the fourth game of the season, but looking back, it was the first that showed how solid we wanted to be. The FA Cup holders hammered Villa 3-0 in the previous game, but we were fantastic at the back to pick up a brilliant point on the road. \n\nDogged defending is a thing of beauty, and one that is overlooked far too often. There is an art in defending, and this season, having conceded 23 in 22 games, we’ve shown ourselves to be masters of this particular art. \n\nEvery point in the Premier League should be celebrated, and maybe that’s why a battling 0-0 draw feels so good. The Man City game was a perfect example of good old fashioned, honest, gutsy defending with players celebrating blocks and tackles.\n\nThis tough attitude should be commended, and there’s nothing wrong with grinding out results here and there. Promoted teams need to come up and be hard to beat, and five losses in 22 games prove we’ve done just that. \n\nThere may have been some boring 0-0 draws in the Premier League this season, but I wouldn’t class ours in any of these. Maybe that’s a Sunderland bias shining through, but at full-time against Man City, I felt as though I’d watched a proper game of football where both sides had chances, but both defences prevailed over the forwards, and it was a back-and-forth kind of game in this sense. \n\nThere has been talk that the Premier League this season is weaker and more boring than in recent years, which seems odd considering that, for the first time in a long time, more than one promoted team has come up and competed. Last season saw three crap teams get promoted and go straight back down with not much of a whimper. It’s almost as if the established sides don’t like it when promoted teams show some fight, which is what we and Leeds are doing in spadefuls. \n\nWe’ll probably have at least one more 0-0 draw this season, and when that comes, it will likely be just as gutsy and fulfilling as the three we have in the bag. I’m still full of pride for Sunderland thriving back in the Premier League and each block, tackle, and header is a step closer towards sealing our status in the top flight next season.",

    "fullText": "During the build up to our home game against Arsenal, I was browsing various forums and came across an article on an Arsenal fan website which assessed the quality of their next opponents.\n\nIt used the (now familiar to us, whether we like it or not) variable of “xG difference” — something we’re reminded of every week on Sky Sports and Match of the Day. For those who don’t know or don’t care, here’s a brief explanation so that you can at least understand for the sake of the article.\n\nXG is basically is the “expected goals” that a side is likely to score in a game, whereas “XG difference” is the expected difference between expected goals scored and expected goals conceded.\n\nIndeed, during a season, there are tables out there showing which teams have the best and worst XG difference throughout the whole campaign so far — which we’ll come onto — but back to the the Arsenal forum’s assessment ahead of our home game on 8 November.\n\nThe “xG difference table” at that point in the season apparently had us ranked “slightly better than Burnley” — who were the bottom of the “XG league”. So looking forward to the game, Gunners’ fans basically had us down as a real poor side and that the game at the Stadium of Light should’ve been one of the easier three points they would get this season.\n\nAs we all know, Sunderland gave Arsenal one of their hardest games of the season to date in a 2-2 draw.\n\nFurthermore, during the twelve games since then, and in what was acknowledged to be the most difficult period of our season in terms of fixtures and losing more players to the AFCON than anyone else, we produced three wins, three defeats and six draws (one of which was a cup win on penalties at Everton ) — hardly the form of a team the data lovers predict should be getting battered every week.\n\nI’m bringing this up now because ahead of Saturday’s game against Crystal Palace, the “XG difference” stats were being produced again, this time in a lengthy article on the BBC’s own website — which you can read here.\n\nAgain the “XG difference” ranks Burnley as by far the worst team in the Premier League, with ourselves as second worst…behind Wolves.\n\nYes, Wolves are better than us, according to the XG purists.\n\nThe article goes on to predict that like a chain from the seabed to a ship trying to pull away, “XG difference” will win through in the end and ourselves and Aston Villa — another club not performing according to the rule book — will get dragged down the league table at some point to where “we should really be”, and if not this season, next season, when we’ll surely suffer from “second season syndrome” like so many promoted clubs before us.\n\nMaybe as Sunderland fans we’re biased and just don’t want to believe it, but I’d say the argument that as a promoted club, we’re destined to face “second season syndrome”, which happened to the likes of Sheffield United, Huddersfield and Ipswich is — and I’m not the first to say — lazy journalism, as they’ve never looked further than the club name and where they came from (the Championship).\n\nIt ignores the fact that apart from a couple of regulars each week, this is a different Sunderland team to the one that won the Championship playoff final back in May — and that there have been way more than one or two quality recruits added to the ranks.\n\nAccording to the stats, one of them (Robin Roefs) is the best-performing shot stopper in the league.\n\nIf there’s a stat that says he is, who’s to argue with it? But when watching him week in and week out, we’re not seeing somebody who’s being peppered with shots like the top prize on the shelf in a coconut shy — so what factors have been taken into account?\n\nWhat’s also largely been ignored is that with the third-best defensive record in the Premier League, Sunderland have largely been set up to defend deeply and to not look to dominate possession.\n\nFor any XG proponent who thinks this is because we’re struggling to do otherwise in the Premier League, it’s worth pointing out that this is what we often did in the Championship under Régis Le Bris.\n\nThe exponents of XG will argue that in increasingly data-driven world of coaching, it’s a stat that the coaches sit up and take notice of, and that they strive to produce teams that have the best stats prior to kick off.\n\nMaybe that’s true, but it’s not the be-all and end-all.\n\nFor one thing, if Sunderland’s XG difference is so bad, why didn’t Le Bris and his staff resign months ago?\n\n“We’ve done all we can but the situation is hopeless. I know we’re currently ninth in the Premier League but the XG difference doesn’t lie. It predicts we’re buggered, so myself and the coaching staff have decided to step aside so that somebody else can turn the XG situation around”.\n\nMaybe I’ve missed it but you rarely hear of managers or head coaches of any team talking of XG in their post-match interviews — except maybe when they’ve been beaten — and some of the comments on the BBC article are worth a look in order to see what the fans of all clubs make of it all.\n\nA couple that caught my eye were along the lines of “You never hear a fan coming away from a match saying that we got beat but we won on XG” or “Manchester City had an XG of two before their cup tie against Exeter, but scored ten. How is this even possible?”\n\nHow about proposing a different set of metrics to measure how a team is doing? In it, the team that sticks the ball in the back of the net most often wins the match.\n\nXG is a metric that myself and I suspect an awful lot of other fans hadn’t heard of ten years ago.\n\nI have no doubt that it’s probably been used by the coaching staff of clubs up and down the country for a bit longer, but such increasing awareness of it in media analysis is fairly new.  As such, is it guaranteed to be 100% accurate? Clearly the XG proponents see Sunderland, Villa and an apparently underperforming Wolves as being anomalies that’ll inevitably fall into line in order to make their data justifiable.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that in Villa’s case, they have someone who’s recognised as one of the best coaches in world football? In our case, we know we have one of the most tactically astute coaches in English football with a bunch of quality recruits, and in Wolves’ case — despite playing well enough — they just can’t defend?\n\nDoes “XG difference” take into account any of these factors?",

    "title": "The Wilson Isidor Dilemma",
    "description": "“For now, it’s a waiting game — and this is the new reality at Sunderland”, writes Phil West of Isidor’s future",
    "fullText": "A short, sharp precursor to a January exit? Something and nothing — or the beginnings of a transfer saga that could cast a wholly unwelcome shadow over the remainder of Sunderland’s season before a summer move is eventually ratified and rubber-stamped?\n\nHowever you view it and regardless of which side of the “sell or keep” argument you sit, the recent rumours concerning Wilson Isidor’s future aren’t exactly unexpected, given his undeniable talent and the situation in which he currently finds himself at Sunderland, but they are highlighting the stark balance we have to strike — that of on-field progress, ambition and squad strength, and balanced books and final stability.\n\nInterest has supposedly arisen both at home and abroad, with fellow Premier League sides Nottingham Forest and Everton credited with an interest and French upstarts Paris FC — seemingly the new “noisy neighbours” in the French capital — apparently ready and willing to throw a comparatively enormous sum of money in our direction in order to lure Isidor across the channel.\n\n“We love you, Wilson…until £20-plus million is dangled in front of us, in which case we’d be happy to bid you farewell.”\n\nIf the mercurial striker does leave for pastures new, I can also see various coping mechanisms kicking in among pockets of the fanbase.\n\nIn some quarters, his ability, work rate and impact will be questioned, and his body language analysed for any signs of a poor attitude or a negative demeanour. This isn’t new; after all, if we convince ourselves that he’s already “checked out”, it would make it easier to deal with because deep down, we all know how talented a footballer he is and that he could be an asset to any team.\n\nI won’t lie: despite the numbers being bandied around, the thought of Sunderland selling Isidor to a Premier League rival — particularly without a very high-quality replacement arriving in his stead — gives me a burning feeling in the pit of my stomach, the kind I felt in the wake of Darren Bent’s messy Wearside exit in 2011.\n\nWere he to leave for France and a new league, fair enough, but potentially strengthening a rival whilst possibly weakening Régis Le Bris’ squad in the process? Not for me. I really do rate Isidor that highly and that’s how strongly I feel about it.\n\nI love his talent, his penchant for a spectacular goal, his seemingly endless supply of optimism and childlike joy at playing football for a living — as well as his potential at the top level, which at the time of writing remains tantalisingly untapped.\n\nFour Premier League goals may be something of a modest return but Isidor — a confidence player and someone for whom hot and cold streaks are simply part of the deal — is by no means a “Flash Harry” and we mustn’t forget that he played a key role during the successful 2024/2025 playoff campaign, getting the ball rolling with a superbly-taken goal against Coventry City — one of many ridiculous strikes he clocked up that season.\n\nThere’s another point here — one that needs to be reiterated in the strongest possible terms.\n\nAs Sunderland supporters, we should be willing to place trust in the club hierarchy when it comes to decisions like this, but I also believe that if we do have doubts or concerns about the potential impact of such a transfer, we should reserve the right to question such calls if and when they’re made.\n\nThis should be accepted without question and despite the exceptional work completed by Florent Ghisolfi and Kristjaan Speakman, allowing such a popular and talented player to leave — regardless of how widely and regularly the “We’ll easily be able find a replacement ” narrative is hawked around — wouldn’t be greeted entirely warmly.\n\nShould Isidor leave before the deadline, is it unreasonable to claim that with only Eliezer Mayenda and Brian Brobbey as our striking options, we would look somewhat short up top and that there would be far greater and possibly unnecessary pressure on Mayenda to begin to develop at an even quicker rate? I don’t think so, and I say that as someone who loves Mayenda as a player and has also been hugely impressed with the impact made by Brobbey.\n\nDepth at this level is key and no matter what the naysayers may claim, I firmly believe that Isidor does have the potential to establish himself as a genuine top flight-quality striker.\n\nThe arguments about his style not complimenting the team’s as a whole may not be totally without merit, but I also believe that players with unique attributes should be given chances to impress, and were we to develop the capacity to occasionally adjust our style of play and place more emphasis on finesse rather than force, that’s where he could thrive.\n\nFor now, it’s a waiting game — and this is the new reality at Sunderland.\n\nWith coveted players on the books comes the risk of interest from elsewhere, and it’s something that we may have to brace ourselves for more often if this season of huge promise continues in a similar vein.",

We were waiting and waiting for that to happen.”\n\n“We’re losing the ability for agents to conduct their work without fear or favor because the F.B.I. won’t protect you.”\n\nForty-five current and former employees on the changes they say are undermining the agency and making America less safe.\n\nWhen he returned to office last year, President Trump called the F.B.I. a “corrupt” agency in need of overhaul. He had by then been the subject of three F.B.I. investigations: Agents examined his 2016 campaign’s alleged ties to Russia, his retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Though all three inquiries took place in part or entirely under Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director Trump appointed, he repeatedly accused the bureau of mounting a partisan attack against him.\n\nTo replace Wray, Trump chose Kash Patel, a former public defender and intelligence official who had never worked for the F.B.I. and had spun conspiracy theories about the bureau. Since Patel’s confirmation last February, the F.B.I. has undergone a transformation that has upended its nonpartisan rules and norms, deeply rattling many of its 38,000 employees.\n\nPatel has fired agents who worked on the Trump investigations and radically changed the bureau’s mission. More than 20 percent of the F.B.I.’s work force has been assigned to immigration enforcement, pulling agents and analysts away from investigating public corruption, cybercrime, white-collar crime, drug trafficking and terrorism. Patel has also been embroiled in controversies over his use of government resources, his temperament and missteps in high-profile investigations.\n\nWe interviewed 45 employees who work at the F.B.I. or who left during Trump’s second term, as well as many other current and former government officials. Beginning with Trump’s selection of Patel, our sources narrated the events that most troubled them over the last year. Many details of what we learned are reported here for the first time.\n\nThe F.B.I. is a rule-bound and tight-lipped institution. Bureau policies prohibit active employees from speaking to the news media without authorization. Even for former employees, speaking out is a sign of serious alarm. Some of our sources shared their stories anonymously because they feared retribution from the administration. (To protect their identities, we are not indicating whether the people we quote anonymously are still employed by the F.B.I.) We corroborated their descriptions of specific events and conversations with colleagues, contemporaneous notes and internal records.\n\nPatel and other F.B.I. leaders named in this article declined our requests for interviews, and we followed up with a detailed list of questions. In response to a request for comment, Ben Williamson, an F.B.I. spokesman, wrote: “This story is a regurgitation of fake narratives, conjecture and speculation from anonymous sources who are disconnected from reality. They can whine and peddle falsehoods all they want — but it won’t change the facts that the F.B.I. under this administration worked with partners at every level and delivered a historic 2025.”\n\nWe also asked the White House for comment. “President Trump and F.B.I. Director Kash Patel are restoring integrity to the F.B.I. by returning its focus to fighting crime and letting good cops be cops,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement.\n\nMany current and former employees fear, however, that the F.B.I. has become a weapon of the White House, and that the firings and the diversion of resources to immigration enforcement have left the country vulnerable to attack.\n\nThree weeks after winning re-election, Trump named Patel as his nominee for F.B.I. director. On a podcast, Patel had promised to shut down bureau headquarters on his first day in the post and reopen it “as a museum of the deep state.”\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: I assumed Congress would see how uniquely unqualified Kash Patel was for the job. I assumed the Senate would do its due diligence and decide not to confirm him.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: When Kash Patel was nominated, we all knew in our bones that the bureau was going to be a very different environment than any of us had experienced before. He regularly referred to us as government gangsters. He was also the author of three children’s books in which he’s a self-styled wizard who saves King Donald Trump from the evil forces of the Justice Department.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: A lot of people in the F.B.I. have faith in the country and in the job. They may come from police or military families. They think they’re doing the right thing and it will all work out. And you know, there was a kernel of truth in what Patel was saying: There are too many people in headquarters. Let’s get more people back into the field.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: I wanted the White House to succeed. For 20 years, I collected information for the president’s daily briefing. I listened to Kash Patel on a podcast, and the way he viewed Jan. 6 aligned with the F.B.I. rank and file. Agents always thought if you assaulted officers on that day, yes, absolutely, we should investigate and prosecute you. For the rest of them, it was a massive misuse of resources.\n\nBut then I heard Patel was thinking of a mass purge of the leadership and dismissing agents wholesale.\n\nThe Trump administration decided that until Patel was confirmed, the F.B.I.’s acting director would be Rob Kissane, a veteran counterterrorism agent. The acting deputy director would be Brian Driscoll, the special agent in charge of the Newark field office. But in its announcement, the White House accidentally named Driscoll to the top position. Though it was an error, Driscoll became the acting No. 1 and Kissane became the No. 2.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: The White House reversing the announcement added to this uncertain, uncomfortable feeling — it doesn’t bode well if they didn’t get that right. But I’ve known Brian and Rob a long time, and some of the other executive assistant directors did as well. We’d all grown up in the bureau, and we wanted to work together.\n\n“They said we were being fired because we could not be trusted to carry out the president’s agenda.”\n\nAt his Senate confirmation hearing, Patel was asked whether he would fire the F.B.I. agents who worked on the investigations that led to the special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump. Patel responded that “no one will be terminated for case assignments.” Later in the hearing, he also promised there would be “no retributive actions” against employees.\n\nThe next day, Trump administration officials, including Emil Bove, the acting deputy attorney general and Trump’s former defense attorney, forced out the bureau’s top six executives, along with the heads of the F.B.I. field offices in Washington, D.C., and Miami.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: Those firings sent shock waves.\n\nSenior executive 1: It was hundreds of years of experience in one brutal swoop. It made it easier to bring their people in, yes, but there are no people to bring in with that level of experience, because it’s so specialized. You have to cut your teeth. It’s just like the military. To lead, you have to understand headquarters and the field.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: I came back to D.C. to run the office at the end of 2022 when two special counsels, Rob Hur and Jack Smith, were appointed to investigate Biden and Trump. I did not direct those cases, but it was my job to manage the agent and analyst resources for them.\n\nWe conducted factual and effective investigations into two presidents from two political parties at the same time. To do that, you need leadership that believes in the nonpartisan independence of the agency. When I was told to retire or be fired, I was frustrated that I couldn’t protect my analysts and agents from partisan interference. I wanted to be their shield.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: At the hearing, Patel made it sound like he didn’t know they were getting rid of all the top leaders. But if he really had nothing to do with it, he would have shown up and asked, Where’d everyone go? But he didn’t ask.\n\nThey said we were being fired because we could not be trusted to carry out the president’s agenda. I asked if there was any allegation of misconduct. They said no.\n\nThis was my life, my career, my identity, my calling. It was a privilege to serve the American people. To end it so quickly, it still upsets me.\n\nWhile Patel waited to be confirmed, Bove ordered the acting F.B.I. leadership to create a list of all employees assigned to Jan. 6 investigations “to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.” In response, Driscoll and Kissane sent a survey to employees asking about their roles in those cases.\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: The news hit about the list and the survey, and it was mass chaos. People who worked on real sensitive cases — Jan. 6, the special-counsel investigations, the public-corruption side of the Trump investigation — were packing up their bags and assuming they were about to be fired. People were crying, taking down family pictures from their desks because they were afraid that they wouldn’t be let back in on Monday. This was at the same time that some of the people who worked on those cases were working on the plane crash in the Potomac. They were diving out there finding dead bodies and being told that they were going to be fired.\n\nNorthwest special agent: If you really dig deep down, it’s not just the case agents. Those cases involved a whole host of other people, like surveillance, negotiators, SWAT teams. It’s hard not to have touched one of those cases in some way. Maybe even more so than 9/11, because Jan. 6 was the largest investigation in the history of the bureau.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: Emil Bove did not care that individual agents have no say in what matters they work on. You get assigned investigations. There were many agents who ended up on that list who had misgivings about how aggressively Jan. 6 was investigated. So there was a real sense that there was a sort of random persecution going on rather than actually figuring out who was making operational decisions and assigning responsibility to senior executives.\n\nBove was viewed by the F.B.I. work force not only as somebody whose integrity could not be trusted but as this almost cartoonish figure halfway between a mob enforcer and the grim reaper.\n\n(Bove did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn response to Bove’s demand, Driscoll and Kissane handed over a list of thousands of employees, identified by only their bureau ID numbers, who worked on the Jan. 6 investigations. In response, current and former F.B.I. employees sued the Justice Department, arguing that compiling the list was a violation of privacy that would endanger agents and their families. As a result of the suit, the Justice Department agreed not to release the names of the people on the list.\n\nSenior executive 3: Bove wanted some scalps; he asked for a short list of the main folks. Driscoll and Kissane decided to give them all case participants — everybody got lumped in. They were trying to protect people by flooding the zone.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: A source called me after Jan. 6 saying they saw people they knew posting photos on social media of themselves at the Capitol. I put this in the pipeline at the time through my squad support secretary. Now she’s on the list for pressing send to get this information to the right place.\n\nField-office leader 1: The entire F.B.I. received a bizarre email from Emil Bove. The email described “insubordination” by Acting Director Driscoll and Acting Deputy Director Kissane regarding their refusal to provide names of the Jan. 6 agents. This is part of why Driscoll is a folk hero.\n\n“‘Defend the homeland’ was now on your screen when you logged in. To me, that sounded like a far-right political slogan.”\n\nThe Senate voted 51 to 49 to confirm Patel. Almost immediately, he changed the F.B.I.’s priorities. Under Wray, the bureau had eight stated goals: combating terrorism, organized crime, espionage, public corruption, white-collar crime, cybercrime and violent crime, as well as protecting civil rights. Now Patel stressed four: defend the homeland, rebuild public trust, crush violent crime and ensure fierce organizational accountability.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: “Defend the homeland” was now on your screen when you logged in. To me, that sounded like a far-right political slogan that betrays the F.B.I.’s nonpartisan mission.\n\nWe also had posters on the wall of the F.B.I.’s core values. Someone pulled the diversity poster down. A photo made the rounds of them painting over “diversity” and the other values at Quantico, the F.B.I. academy.\n\nThat was very frustrating, because we spent time on this in training at Quantico. Diversity meant the F.B.I. cared about having people from all walks of life. In Hoover’s time, it was all accountants and lawyers. Now it’s not like that. One of my classmates was a manager at a major appliance company. Others came from D.C. consulting groups. And then there were the military and the police officers.\n\nPhilip Fields, former counterterrorism analyst: The first thing they did was they disbanded our Foreign Influence Task Force. They said that we had to pull back on investigations under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, which applies to people who might be working at the direction of a foreign government without disclosing it. People that I worked with in the counterintelligence program were very upset about a lot of the investigative tools being taken away.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: Shifting priorities away from cyber means less time tracing illicit cryptocurrency transactions, unmasking the identities of cybercriminals and determining their locations around the world, and disrupting nation-state adversaries who target critical infrastructure.\n\nWhen former F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray went before Congress in January 2024, he said that even if we shifted every single F.B.I. agent and analyst to working China cyber, we would be working with one person to 50 Chinese hackers or cyberthreat actors. That’s an insane statistic — and that’s just China.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: I was responsible for the morning intelligence briefing. Every director gets to choose how they want to receive information — how often and in what form. I did everything I could, leading up to Director Patel coming on board, to provide options for how those meetings would run. What type of information do you want? Do you like graphics? Do you like to read? All of that. I wanted to set him up, from Day 1, to make effective decisions.\n\nField-office leader 1: Patel had his first director’s call with the heads of all the field offices. He had no agenda, no organized thoughts, no strategy or leadership philosophy or priorities to share. I specifically remember him saying at one point, “I don’t read.” He explained he didn’t read briefing materials.\n\nSenior executive 2: There was a feeling among many in the F.B.I. that the bureau needed to change. Some believed HQ had gotten too big; metrics and bureaucracy were inhibiting investigations, and resources needed to be better aligned to the threats.\n\nBut what Kash said was basically that every process at the F.B.I. was de facto wrong and would no longer be followed. It came across as contempt for the way former directors had done business and a statement that the former structures would not apply to him.\n\nWith Patel installed, Trump named his pick for deputy director. Rather than choosing a career agent, which had been the practice for most of the F.B.I.’s history, the president selected Dan Bongino, a right-wing podcaster and former Secret Service agent who had described F.B.I. agents as “thugs for the Democrat Party” and called for disbanding the bureau.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: The deputy director oversees daily operations, so it has always been someone who knows the bureau, who has worked their way up, knows the culture, knows policy. Patel had explicitly stated to the F.B.I. Agents Association that he would appoint an in-house F.B.I. special agent, as had been the case for over 100 years.\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: When we found out that Dan Bongino was going to be the deputy director, concern reached a fever pitch. We were going to have two people who it would not be an exaggeration to say were conspiracy theorists with very little experience in federal law enforcement.\n\nSenior executive 3: Patel stopped having his weekly meetings with the leaders of the field offices on Wednesdays. There were phone calls from one individual to another, and things were getting missed, things were getting dropped, because they didn’t want to have an email chain.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: Routine internal communications stopped. The director and the deputy got frustrated with media leaks, and they wouldn’t send anything out about people retiring and new people filling their roles or reorganization of the work force. People had to go to social media to see what was going on and who might be next on the chopping block.\n\n(In response to questions about this article, Bongino wrote in an email: “A ‘media’ enterprise that viciously propagated the most destructive political hoax in American history? You guys are jokers, relying on people we likely removed for misfeasance or malfeasance, to feed your ignorant audience the nonsense gruel they crave.”)\n\nPatel directed the F.B.I., which has no immigration-enforcement authority, to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement in conducting raids and making arrests. Field offices began assigning F.B.I. agents and analysts to work immigration shifts, pulling them away from other priorities like counterterrorism, public corruption and white-collar crime.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: We’d been told that when Trump watched footage or saw a picture of a raid, he got mad that he didn’t see F.B.I. raid jackets.\n\nICE was saying they wanted their teams to commingle with our teams. Tactically, you don’t commingle units that haven’t trained together. My bosses said, If we work on immigration, we use our teams and our case info. They put together a list of people already in F.B.I. files we had concerns about, so we’re not just targeting people over their citizenship status.\n\nThey also had to juggle Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who wanted to ride in our tactical vehicle to do her TV stuff. That makes all the operators uneasy, and it makes them less safe.\n\n(The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: I had 20 years’ experience. I was involved in undercover sensitive operations. The bureau hired me for national security, to prevent threats from Al Qaeda and other groups throughout the Near East — not to sit in a parking lot arresting immigrants.\n\nMidwest case agent: I was a grunt agent. I enjoyed trying to take apart large criminal organizations piece by piece.\n\nThey relabeled task forces from drugs to immigration and pushed us toward focusing on deportation versus convictions for actual drug offenses.\n\nUnfortunately, what used to be our focus, long-term investigations, are now short-term hits. You hit the guy carrying the bag, not the guy who made the call, because that’s how you drive up the arrest and prosecution numbers. But the guy carrying the bag, you can’t flip anymore, because he’s getting deported.\n\nBecause F.B.I. agents are posting up with Homeland Security, citizens think we’re part of ICE, which disrupts other investigations. It used to be that you could sit in front of a house, watching another house, and a lot of the time, people were OK with that. They might help you. Now they’re scared.\n\nJill Fields, former supervisory intelligence analyst for violent crime in the Los Angeles field office: They decided they were going to do a big immigration push for one week at the end of February. L.A. is a major transshipment hub for drugs, and you’re going to take people off of cartel cases? They wanted three times the normal number of people in the command post on each shift. I was like, This is too much. I was told that we’ve got to do it for optics. It was to make a show for the president.\n\nI was ordered to have members of my team run a preassessment on some anti-ICE protesters who allegedly had impeded an immigration arrest. F.B.I. policy says that an investigation can’t be opened based on First Amendment-protected activity. The investigative team who analyzed the video determined that the protesters had done nothing wrong; the officers told them to stay back, and they did.\n\nI was told they had to open an investigation anyway. I pushed back, and they said, Jill, you can either get fired today, or you can get fired in four years — meaning when another administration comes in and starts looking into constitutional violations. And I was like: Then fire me today. I’m not doing something that is fundamentally wrong.\n\nI had my squad taken away from me. I was told I was a problem. I was told that the seventh floor was aware of me — the seventh floor means the F.B.I. director’s office. My squad depended on me, and now they have absolutely no top cover anymore. When they took my squad, I was done.\n\n“I was told that we’ve got to do it for optics. It was to make a show for the president.”\n\nPam Bondi, the attorney general, sent a letter to Patel accusing the F.B.I.’s New York field office of holding back thousands of pages of documents in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Hundreds of bureau employees were diverted from their regular duties to review and process more than 100,000 pages, flagging references to Trump and other well-known people as well as redacting information about victims.\n\nMichael Bovin, former intelligence analyst: We got this email about a big redaction project — all hands on deck. I thought it was the J.F.K. assassination. Nope. It’s Epstein. Our job is to go through and make sure the computer got the right stuff redacted. We’re working around the clock.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: A member of the redaction team asked me, “Can I not work on this anymore?” They’d had a team call, and Patel jumped on the call and yelled at everyone, telling them to work faster — that he’d fire everyone who worked on the redactions if he didn’t have it when he wanted it.\n\nThe F.B.I. ordered field offices to devote a third of their time to immigration enforcement. Ramping up deportations was the highest priority for Stephen Miller, one of Patel’s key allies.\n\nField-office leader 1: Kash and Dan seemed to have no control over the immigration demands being placed on the F.B.I. Emails sent to F.B.I. field leaders with immigration staffing requirements were forwarded directly from D.O.J.\n\nICE did not have the requisite data or any semblance of a strategic plan to make the F.B.I.’s efforts effective. Each F.B.I. field office was simply told to provide the designated number of F.B.I. agents to the immigration effort.\n\nI remember praying that we didn’t have a terrorist attack, mass shooting or cyberattack slip through the cracks because my agents, who were highly trained to protect against such threats, were assigned to immigration enforcement.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: When you’re taking an agent or analyst who is an expert on the Russian F.S.B. and you have them focused on name checks for immigration enforcement, what investigations are sitting because they’ve been diverted?\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: The immigration push grew immensely, and it grew fast. Leadership was like, This isn’t going away, and all of you will now participate. HQ informed our field offices that the agents out with ICE needed to be taking pictures so they could post them to social media. I had never been asked to do that during an arrest operation before. It’s inappropriate and tactically unsound.\n\nField-office leader 2: I am a conservative. I believe in tightening our borders. I just had an issue with the execution of it. My counterparts at D.H.S. were constantly getting yelled at, being threatened and fearing for their jobs. That’s not the way to work. They literally had quotas. Each region had to have a certain amount of arrests every single day. It was completely asinine.\n\nThis is how things go sideways. For me, the No. 1 priority was agent safety. I don’t want my agent to be killed or to be responsible for somebody else getting killed. I did everything I could to make sure that headquarters is happy, but at the same time, I’m not jeopardizing my agents or my morals or the Constitution either.\n\nNorthwest special agent: In Minneapolis, agents were surveilling a bunch of Somali-run autism centers because it was a kickback scheme. The centers were recruiting kids from the community, falsely diagnosing them and giving the parents a cut of the federal dollars they received for treatment. This became front-page news when the criminal indictments came down, but back in February, agents had to stop investigating for weeks to work immigration. I did not go to law school, go to Quantico and work counterterrorism operations overseas to be doing traffic control for arrest-a-brown-person day.\n\nCentral U.S. case agent: I was working an undercover operation on a neo-Nazi group with a long history of criminal activity. The F.B.I.’s niche in the federal law enforcement community is these specialized investigations, and now we’re being pulled away from those. If I’d wanted to be a cop, I would have just done that. When I resigned from the F.B.I., I was told they’d have to close the investigation — there was no one else around to pick it up.\n\nPatel traveled to Britain to attend a secret conference of the Five Eyes, the intelligence alliance formed after World War II among the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSenior executive 2: Every May, there’s a Five Eyes conference with the head of every intelligence agency. This year it was in the U.K. Kash Patel is going. In the lead-up to that, his detail starts making crazy requests. He’s got special requirements on everything. And the Brits are getting pissed.\n\nBefore the conference, his staff says he’s unhappy because he doesn’t like meetings in office settings. What he wants is social events. He wants Premier soccer games. He wants to go jet skiing. He’d like a helicopter tour. Everyone who heard about this was like: Hold on. Is he really going to ask the MI5 director to go jet skiing instead of meeting? The schedule is set, and every Five Eyes partner is doing this. They can’t just say that he’s not participating and instead he wants to go to a Premier soccer game. This is a job, guys.\n\nHis staff only cared about three things: what his meals were, when his workouts would be and what his entertainment would be. The biggest plan is how he’s going to get his girlfriend in there so she can go to Windsor Castle. He’s got Nicole Rucker as his assistant, like a true executive concierge. And when she’s not getting the food or the workout she wants, she’ll just start screaming at people, Make it happen!\n\nHis staff was briefed multiple times that the Brits were going to want to talk about an F.B.I. position in London that has been pulled. The F.B.I. is arguably their most important partner. MI5 is 5,000 people. The F.B.I. is 38,000. If MI5 ceased to exist, it would be very bad for us. If we cease to exist, it would be an existential threat for them. That person was working on a ton of sensitive stuff, including embassy penetrations and technology, and they want this position back. So Ken McCallum, the MI5 director, goes to Kash Patel at the conference and says: Hey, we really need this position. It’s so important for our mutual benefit. And Kash says: Yep, that person’s going nowhere. She’s absolutely staying. And the Brits rejoice.\n\nTwo weeks later, he reverses himself and removes her. The Brits are outraged. Kash will make promises and he will break them, and he doesn’t worry about that.\n\nOn that trip, the heads of intelligence for the Five Eyes went to Windsor Castle and met with the king. There was a photo taken of all the Five Eyes people, some of whom are nondisclosed, meaning their affiliation with the British intelligence service isn’t public. The Brits forwarded that picture as a keepsake for the individuals. They prefaced it with, This isn’t to be shared. But Kash has decided he wants to post it on social media. They have people trying to negotiate with the Brits about whether that’s possible. They’re fighting with the director’s office, like: You cannot post this. Do not do that. And they’re arguing, He wants a picture out.\n\n(The F.B.I. did not respond to questions about this trip.)\n\n“The feeling I have more is unremitting anger at the executives who have taken an oath to the Constitution and are making moral compromises on a daily basis.”\n\nMichael Feinberg, a leader of the F.B.I.’s field office in Norfolk, Va., was forced out after Bongino discovered he was friends with Peter Strzok, an agent fired in 2018 for disparaging Trump while investigating his campaign’s ties to Russia. In a text exchange, Strzok called Trump an “idiot,” and he responded to another text about Trump’s presidential run by saying, “We’ll stop it.” (In response to a request for comment, Strzok noted that the Justice Department’s inspector general found that political bias did not influence decision-making in the Russia investigation.)\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: I was at the field office working out in the gym on a Saturday, and I got a phone call from Dominique Evans, my newly appointed special agent in charge. She was on a cruise in Europe, and I was leading the office in her absence. She told me that Dan Bongino had somehow found out that I was friends with Pete Strzok. I explained to her that Pete and I had worked together in the counterintelligence division before there was any scandal associated with his name. We discovered we were into the same bands and became friends. I wasn’t breaking any policy by going to see Nick Cave and Warren Ellis with him.\n\nDominique says she’s going to get back to Bongino. When she calls me back, she says that Bongino is not satisfied with my explanation and that he’s going to talk with Patel about it. She calls me back again later, and I ask her just to be square with me. I explain I love my job, I care deeply about the organization and, personally, I have a wife in the middle of a high-risk pregnancy. What exactly is going to happen to me?\n\nAnd she says: You’re probably going to be demoted. You should expect to get polygraphed or investigated about your relationship with Pete. And I am immediately removing you as acting special agent in charge in my absence.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of hanging up with her, I knew that I was going to quit. I took an oath to the Constitution, as idealistic as that sounds, and the point of an oath is that you follow it regardless of personal consequences. I was being targeted for blatantly political reasons. I don’t want to sound like a boy scout, but we have to be an apolitical organization that does things by the book. We have the power to deprive people of their freedom. And in some circumstances, we have the power to deprive people of their lives.\n\n(An F.B.I. spokesman said employees have been forced out only for behaving unethically or failing to deliver on the agency’s mission. He declined to comment on specific firings, including Feinberg’s.)\n\nTo be hired by the bureau and receive a security clearance, most F.B.I. personnel must pass a polygraph test, during which they are asked about foreign contacts, drug use and serious criminal conduct. The bureau also administers polygraphs to agents working on highly classified investigations and to agents accused of misconduct. The New York Times revealed that Patel was ramping up the F.B.I.’s use of polygraphs to crack down on media leaks and ensure loyalty to him personally. One question frequently asked was whether employees had said anything negative about the director.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: I worked counterintelligence and espionage cases my entire career. The polygraph is voodoo science. The bureau doesn’t predicate cases on a polygraph — it’s just an indicator. People fail a poly for lots of reasons. It puts somebody in the position of being very nervous. It’s purposely stressful.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: They were polygraphing their own senior leadership team because they were so mad about media leaks. Each assistant director, as head of division, had to identify two people in our division to polygraph. Many of us volunteered ourselves and then asked one of our deputies so we wouldn’t have to put it on our people.\n\nDawn E. Morrow, former senior human-resources manager: One of my employees got polygraphed for being in a meeting where apparently something was leaked. The way they were being used when I left was as a weapon, almost a punishment.\n\nA gunman opened fire outside CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Mich. He shot and wounded one person before being killed by the church’s security staff.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: ​​Bongino called the field office in Detroit. In the normal course of business, if the deputy director calls at a moment like that, they’re asking: How can we help? What do you need? They can turn on all the resources of the organization. But Bongino called and asked, What can I tweet about this?\n\nThe field office has to be careful — this is their boss. But the body was still there. They said, We’ll get back to you. But Bongino kept calling back, asking, What can I tweet?\n\n(Bongino declined to respond to questions about this specific event and others.)\n\nTonya Ugoretz, the head of intelligence at the F.B.I., was removed from her position.\n\nHer dismissal came after Senator Chuck Grassley — an Iowa Republican and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which conducts oversight of the intelligence agencies — requested information from the F.B.I. about a years-old intelligence report. The report contained a secondhand tip that the Chinese government was creating fake IDs to cast votes for Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe F.B.I. provided Grassley with emails from agents debating the report, which was ultimately withdrawn amid doubts about its credibility. In one email, an F.B.I. employee wrongly identified Ugoretz as the official who ordered the withdrawal.\n\nIn another email, an analyst expressed concern that the report might have been suppressed for political reasons. Marshall Yates, the head of the F.B.I.’s office of congressional affairs, who provided the emails, wrote to Grassley endorsing the idea that the report was suppressed.\n\nTonya Ugoretz, former assistant director of the directorate of intelligence: For whatever reason, my name was mentioned as one of two officials who told the Albany field office, which issued that report, to recall it. It wasn’t true. I was in the cyber division then, so it wouldn’t have been my role. When I found out, I spoke to my supervisor. We met with Bongino that day. I was told it was out of his hands. I wasn’t sure what that meant.\n\nThe next afternoon, I was placed on administrative leave. I was told that was because the F.B.I. didn’t want to have to explain to Grassley’s office why the person named in the emails was the current head of intelligence.\n\nI heard that other F.B.I. leaders were stunned and asking for some kind of due process. Our inspection division contacted me and said they were going to conduct a strategic review — an internal investigation of the Albany field report and whether senior leadership, above me at the highest levels, directed this intelligence to be buried. I was interviewed twice for that and polygraphed.\n\nIn October, I got a call to discuss my options. I had to ask — What did the review show? The official I met with said he hadn’t read it, but his understanding was the review found no misconduct by me or related to the recall of the report.\n\nI asked, If the review found I did nothing wrong, why can’t I return to my position? I was given the standard line: It’s at the director’s discretion to reassign senior executives, which is true. The only options I was given were demotions. I decided to leave.\n\nI’m just one person in a series of senior officials who were disappeared. I can’t think of a better word for it. Heads of field offices would be there one day and gone the next.\n\nI’m a firm believer in the oversight function of Congress. Conducting intelligence missions in a democracy, as the F.B.I. does, requires oversight and accountability. ​​It’s hard to say that providing materials to Congress is bad. But in my case, sharing the documents without having done any work to explain whether an allegation was true or false — how does that help Congress in its oversight mission?\n\nWhat it does do is create fear among the work force. They lose the trust in their own agency to have their back.\n\n“They were polygraphing their own senior leadership team because they were so mad about media leaks.”\n\nPatel fired Brian Driscoll, the former acting director who had been leading the crisis-response group after Patel’s confirmation, and Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office. Evans had been brought to Patel’s attention by Kyle Seraphin, a podcaster and former F.B.I. agent who was suspended by the bureau in 2022.\n\n“He’s fucked.” (Driscoll and Evans have alleged wrongful termination in a pending lawsuit against the F.B.I.)\n\nPublic-corruption agent: Seraphin and other agents who have been suspended are out there on social media with the credibility of being former F.B.I. agents. If you can say, I’m the victim because of this guy Spencer Evans, and then he gets fired, it increases your credibility. People see that and think, Maybe they’re correct, and the whole system is corrupt — even if most of it is nonsense.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: The downside of having folks scared about losing their jobs is that you go from being an organization where people come in and do the work to spending time keeping their head down or on LinkedIn looking for jobs.\n\nI want to sound the alarm about how this affects Americans’ safety. I’ve seen it up close, where we have stopped stuff Americans will never know about. The F.B.I. doesn’t do a good job, in my opinion, of highlighting the number of things it stops. There’s a concern about scaring people; you don’t want to make people feel under dire threat all the time. But thousands of attacks stopped over a few years is normal. That depends, though, on people doing the work.\n\n“I assumed Congress would see how uniquely unqualified Kash Patel was for the job.”\n\nPatel fired Walter Giardina, an agent from the elite public-corruption squad in Washington known as CR-15 that ran Arctic Frost, the investigation into Trump for interference in the 2020 election.\n\nTwo months earlier, Grassley had sent Patel and Bondi a letter containing misconduct allegations against Giardina made by unnamed whistle-blowers. They included a claim that Giardina had corroborated the Steele dossier, a set of later-discredited memos about Trump’s ties to Russia in 2016.\n\nGrassley named Giardina in the letter despite the bureau’s standard practice of protecting case agents by asking Congress to redact their names from sensitive disclosures. (Clare Slattery, a spokeswoman for Grassley, said in a statement that it is his “longstanding office policy to leave names unredacted in public document productions” because “Americans deserve to know how their tax dollars are being spent.”)\n\nGiardina tried to meet with Yates, the head of the office of congressional affairs, to contest the allegations and explain that he never had access to the Steele dossier.\n\nWalter Giardina, former CR-15 agent: ​​I took a lot of pride in being trusted with difficult assignments. Until this year, public corruption was the No. 1 criminal priority of the F.B.I. The people you’re going after may be powerful, and they can come after you in asymmetric ways.\n\nWhen Senator Grassley wrote a letter naming me to the director as the person behind the Steele dossier, that was punching all the way down. I don’t know of any other time that a senator wrote a letter attacking an individual street-level agent. I’m begging my managers and the office of congressional affairs to meet with me to sort out this situation — for me personally, but also for the F.B.I. as a whole. It would take one second to look at the case access history and see that I never even had access to the Steele matter. I had nothing to do with that.\n\nMy wife was in and out of the hospital from June 5 to July 15, when she passed away. During that time, I kept trying to meet with the office of congressional affairs about responding to Grassley’s letter. On June 19, we had a meeting set at the Hoover Building. My wife had just started a new chemo medication. She had a terrible adverse reaction, and I said I was having family health concerns and asked to do the meeting via Teams, which would be pretty normal. They immediately canceled it. When I asked why, the answer was that Marshall Yates wanted to do the meeting not as an interview but as a mock hearing.\n\nI didn’t know my wife was about to pass away. I reserved a conference room at the hospital to meet the office of congressional affairs next to her room, so they could interview me. They didn’t show up. She died the next day.\n\nAt my insistence, I was finally interviewed two days after her funeral. I said: I don’t want anyone to tell me it’s too soon. I won’t be emotional. I want to get this over with. I knew the interview was messed up because Marshall Yates wasn’t present. I had a prepared statement with all the facts. I gave it to them. They didn’t ask any questions. I sent all the records they asked for. Then it was over. They’d already decided to fire me, so no one was taking the interview seriously except me.\n\nIn CR-15, we worked the cases we were assigned. It was not my idea to open Arctic Frost. We were detailed to Jack Smith. The supervisors came to us and said, You’re going to do this. We’re losing the ability for agents to conduct their work without fear or favor because the F.B.I. won’t protect you.\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: Walter was one of the most heartbreaking ones, because it was the week after he buried his wife. She had cancer, and then he gets hit with this. I was at a happy hour at the Irish Channel, sitting outside with some other agents. And it was like: Oh, my god. How do we support him? How do we get food to him? Because he’s on his own with three kids.\n\nBlaire Toleman, former supervisory special agent for CR-15: My team always did the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons. But the F.B.I. fired some of them for no reason, with no internal investigation we knew of. To fire my colleagues like that was shocking. I thought, Shouldn’t it just be me, not the people I assigned to work on a case? I had huge grief about them.\n\nWe all worked in an agency where the truth was paramount. I said, People in the F.B.I. will follow the facts. We were waiting and waiting for that to happen.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: CR-15 is a storied squad. Walter and Blaire, like others, were chosen for the squad because they were exceptionally talented and experienced investigators. They could not tell you the breakdown of the political affiliations of the subjects they investigated. They were two of the best agents I’ve ever worked with, and I’ve worked with a lot of great ones.\n\nThe F.B.I. is accountable for what it accomplishes or fails to accomplish as an agency. We don’t attach responsibility to individual case agents, who don’t even get to choose what cases they’re working.\n\nCharlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a university in Utah. Hours later, Patel told his 1.8 million followers on X that a suspect had been detained, only to backtrack shortly afterward. Patel then flew to Utah to personally oversee the investigation.\n\nJohn Sullivan, former section chief in the intelligence division: I’ve run so many command posts for major attacks. You don’t know in the initial aftermath what’s going on, but you should be able to say to bosses, “We think there are five suspects,” or “We think it’s this one person,” and know that the information won’t leave that conference room. Because it could be wrong. Often, in the beginning, it is wrong.\n\nHuman-intelligence agent: Now social media dominates and controls the perception of what we should be doing. It’s incredibly hard — whether you’re an operational support technician or a special agent or op assistant director — not to let it get to you. It’s all we’re hearing.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: When he landed in Salt Lake City, Patel didn’t have a raid jacket and reportedly ordered people to go find him one. He needed a size medium. They found him a female’s jacket that didn’t have the patches that he wanted, so he had the SWAT team taking their patches off to put on his jacket before he would go to the press conference. I haven’t worn my raid jacket since Quantico, in 20 years of my career. You just don’t wear it, especially in a leadership position.\n\nSenior executive 2: Whenever there’s a critical incident, one of the first things that happens is a conference call with everybody — all the executives, most of the field offices dial in. The director rarely speaks, because someone with situational awareness is leading the call. They’ll say: Here’s what happened. Here’s what we know. Here’s what we need. But we get on, and it’s just Kash berating the special agent in charge in Salt Lake. He’s super emotional.\n\nAnd then it turns surreal. He and Bongino start talking about their Twitter strategy. And Kash is like: I’m gonna tweet this. Salt Lake, you tweet that. Dan, you come in with this. Then I’ll come back with this. They’re literally scripting out their social media, not talking about how we’re going to respond or resources or the situation. He’s screaming that he wants to put stuff out, but it’s not even vetted yet. It’s not even accurate.\n\nWhen I was an agent, I did hundreds of these cases. The initial information that comes in is always wrong. There’s too much coming in, and it takes time to vet. And it was obvious that Kash can’t understand that and doesn’t want to understand that.\n\nEveryone on the call is just like: This guy is completely out of control. On another call, he said: When a crisis happens, the only thing you need to do is call me. The most important thing in any crisis is controlling the narrative. I was like: No, no, no. We actually have to do some work here. We’re going to have to investigate, to solve this.\n\nIn a congressional hearing, Patel was questioned about his and Bongino’s decision to change the bureau’s fitness test for new agents, replacing situps with pull-ups. Senator Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, pointed out that the increased emphasis on upper-body strength could make the test disproportionately harder for women because of differences in physiology. Patel replied that the new test was appropriate for agents in the field who “have to chase down bad guys and do really hard work.” The F.B.I. went forward with adding pull-ups to the test, scoring men and women differently.\n\nSenior executive 3: Bongino wanted to establish a new physical-fitness test without any evidence-based research. He wanted to have men and women do the exact same pull-ups, which all of the data said would lead to losing a number of female recruits and potentially female agents that hadn’t been tested for pull-ups before.\n\nWhen he was informed of that, Bongino said, You can have the best female agent take down the biggest case in our history, but if on the Ring door-camera video she’s out of shape or overweight, that’s going to be the story. He was worried about whether or not they’d look good on a doorbell camera. He said it’s the way these times are.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: I score really high on the physical-fitness test. I coached sports. I can do pull-ups when I train for them. But there was still a feeling of diminished value. The test should actually be reflective of our daily duties.\n\n“Our motto is ‘Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity.’ I hope and pray one day they will have upper leadership that embodies that.”\n\nThe F.B.I. fired a group of agents who were photographed kneeling during a Black Lives Matter protest in the summer of 2020. A dozen of those agents later sued the F.B.I. for wrongful termination, claiming that the crowd had backed them against a wall and was throwing objects. They knelt, they said, “to defuse a volatile situation, not as an expressive political act.”\n\nMaria Ricci, former assistant special agent in charge of the Washington field office: Three of the people in that picture had worked for me. We’re not cops, despite what Kash Patel says. We’re investigators. We gather evidence and build cases. That summer, we were put on the street to handle riots. And we were never, ever trained to do that. Cops have batons. They have pepper spray. They have all sorts of other tools for crowd control. What we have are our voices and our guns. These agents were surrounded and made a decision to de-escalate the situation. And that was, in my opinion, the right choice.\n\nSenior leader for counterintelligence: The firings were a reaction to people online calling them Kneel Team Six. That incident was investigated by F.B.I. leadership, and the agents were cleared. Then Kash Patel comes in and reopens the whole thing. They were cleared again, but Patel fired them anyway.\n\nPatel dismissed David Maltinsky, an F.B.I. agent in training, who had displayed a Pride flag at his desk when he worked for the bureau as a tactical specialist in Los Angeles. Maltinsky was three weeks from his graduation at Quantico.\n\nDavid Maltinsky, former tactical specialist and agent trainee: My aunt and uncle are in law enforcement — my aunt is a retired special agent — and I aspired to carry out that same mission. So when I applied and was accepted at Quantico, I was accomplishing my life’s goal.\n\nI was in the dorms with my squad when I heard that my supervisor needed to talk to me. She and I were led into a conference room. Then the executives walked in and sat down. One of them said, David, there’s no other way to say this, but you are being terminated effective today. He handed me a letter that said I had “exercised poor judgment with an inappropriate display of political signage” in my work station in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2021, the F.B.I. approved Pride flags to fly in front of federal buildings. At the end of Pride month that year, the flag that had flown outside the L.A. field office was given to me by bureau leaders to maintain. Other gay F.B.I. employees texted me to say how incredible it was to see it up there. It wasn’t that long ago that being gay meant you couldn’t get a security clearance — you couldn’t have a job at the F.B.I. It was 1993 before you could serve openly.\n\nReading the letter, I was thinking this may be connected to a complaint that my supervisor got after the inauguration. An employee who worked on another floor claimed the flag was now in violation of President Trump’s executive order banning D.E.I. The flag had been on my desk for years at that point. My supervisor reassured me that it didn’t violate anything in his view. He said: Keep it up. You don’t need to take it down. But somehow word of the Pride flag reached Kash Patel.\n\nOne of the executives asked me where I was going to go that night, and I told him I had nowhere to go. It was so quiet in that room. You could see in their faces that they thought this was awful. They said, You could stay another night if you need to plan and pack. I appreciated that, but if the directive was for me to leave, I’m going to leave.\n\nGrassley released documents showing that F.B.I. agents working on Arctic Frost subpoenaed the Jan. 6 call logs of nine Republican members of Congress. The logs did not include the content of the conversations, but Grassley said that the subpoenas amounted to spying and that Arctic Frost was “arguably worse than Watergate.”\n\nPatel then fired two more agents who worked on Arctic Frost. He also shut down the CR-15 public-corruption squad. “You’re darn right I fired those agents,” Patel said that night on Fox News. “You’re darn right I blew up CR-15.”\n\nPublic-corruption agent: “Vendetta” is the best word for what they’re doing. I’ve tried to figure out where the vitriol comes from. I think it’s partisanship.\n\nFrom a basic investigative standpoint, if you’re looking into a possible conspiracy and you want to know who that person might have reached out to on a particular date or time, then seeking subpoenas for call records is a reasonable and logical step. We’re talking only about the in-and-out numbers and the date, time and length of the calls. Obtaining that information is such a basic tenet of an investigation. And sometimes you get it and you find out it means absolutely nothing. It helps you rule something out.\n\nJacqueline Maguire, former executive assistant director: There are rules surrounding grand-jury material to protect the integrity of an investigation as well as people’s privacy and civil liberties. These proceedings are normally kept secret. Documents in a case file are part of a pending investigation, and more action is needed to corroborate the evidence. It’s problematic to release this material without context.\n\nPatel flew on an F.B.I. jet to a wrestling event in Pennsylvania, where his girlfriend, the country singer Alexis Wilkins, was performing the national anthem. The pair then took the plane to Nashville, where Wilkins lives. That weekend, Patel again used the jet for personal travel, this time for a trip to Boondoggle Ranch, a hunting resort in Texas that is owned by a major Republican donor.\n\nKyle Seraphin, the former agent and podcaster who previously supported Patel, posted some of the flight records on X and criticized him for flying at taxpayer expense during a government shutdown. Patel reportedly blamed Steven Palmer, an agent who oversaw the bureau’s aviation assets, for the bad publicity and fired him.\n\nField-office leader 2: There’s a $545 million budget cut for the bureau. Meanwhile, you’re spending millions of dollars just gallivanting. How do you justify that?\n\nSenior executive 2: Whenever the girlfriend is going to sing the national anthem at some wrestling event or some National Rifle Association or Turning Point event, they’re calling the local SWAT team, saying, You’re going to guard her. Meanwhile, in Nashville, those poor bastards — their SWAT team has actually been converted to her protection. They’re not even doing their own SWAT arrests anymore. They’ve got to bring in other teams to do that, because they’re guarding her all the time.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: This is among the reasons William Sessions lost his job when he was F.B.I. director — for allegedly misusing government planes and having agents run errands for his wife. That was the 1990s. Since then, having a SWAT team protect an F.B.I. director’s family member or girlfriend — to my knowledge, that didn’t happen when the director wasn’t present. And I spent more than half my career in tactical positions, including three years in which I had programmatic control of every F.B.I. SWAT team.\n\nPatel fired four more agents who worked on Arctic Frost after Grassley released documents from whistle-blowers naming them.\n\nCoordination between Grassley and the F.B.I.’s office of congressional affairs was unusually close throughout the year. Marshall Yates, the head of the O.C.A., and his team combed through the F.B.I.’s files to identify agents they thought were biased, according to congressional aides. Former law-enforcement officials believe these agents are among those whose names Grassley is making public, bypassing the F.B.I.’s protections for employees. (A Grassley spokeswoman said his disclosures followed the rules and were thoroughly vetted over months or years.)\n\nYates and Rosemaria Marketos, a former CR-15 agent working with him, were also members of the Weaponization Working Group, a task force created by Bondi to address “abuses of the criminal-justice process” during the Biden administration.\n\nChristopher O’Leary, former senior executive in the counterterrorism division: The irony of the name “weaponization group” is rich. They are doing what they said the Biden administration did. If the weaponization group and the office of congressional affairs have merged at a certain level, that is very problematic for two reasons. First, this merger abandons the F.B.I.’s history of being unbiased. Second, O.C.A. becomes another bullhorn for this administration’s political narrative. The people paying the price are the public servants in the F.B.I. and D.O.J., and more broadly, the American people.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: It’s concerning to me that senior officials are saying agents from the Department of Homeland Security need to wear masks to avoid being doxxed, while the names of F.B.I. agents are being read aloud in Congress, which can lead to the same risks. I’ve not seen a public defense of these agents, which may be the unfortunate result of the removal of so much of the F.B.I.’s senior leadership.\n\nIn a final blow to CR-15, Patel fired Blaire Toleman, who was in charge of the squad when it investigated Trump.\n\nBlaire Toleman, former supervisory special agent for CR-15: In my years of service, I never so much as got a stern talking-to. I got a call saying I’d receive a letter by the end of the day that I was no longer employed with the F.B.I. I was at a training. I asked if I had to drive to the office to turn my stuff in. Yes, I did. My squad helped me pack up my office. My wife picked me up. Quite a few people, around 40, walked me out.\n\nOn the way home, I got a call that I might not be getting fired. Then I got another call two hours later: You’re definitely not fired. Then the next day, I got fired again. My letter of termination said I was being fired due to my lack of judgment, leading to the weaponization of the government. In reality, they were firing us because they didn’t like the case we worked.\n\nA lot of people in the bureau are pissed about what’s happening, but they will step up to try to make sure the American people remain safe, because that’s our job. When I was getting walked out, I told my squad and the other people with me: Keep your heads up. Don’t let the American people suffer.\n\nIn a leaked memo, Bondi tasked the F.B.I. with compiling a list of “domestic terrorism organizations” in response to a presidential memorandum in September that ordered federal law enforcement to prioritize domestic threats, particularly antifa.\n\n“Common threads animating this violent conduct,” the presidential memorandum stated, “include anti-Americanism, anticapitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States government; extremism on migration, race and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion and morality.”\n\nAt a congressional hearing in September, Patel testified that the bureau had increased the number of domestic terror investigations opened that year by 300 percent.\n\nPhilip Fields, former counterterrorism analyst: Antifa is not an organization. It is a loosely formulated ideology. Designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization blurs the lines between investigating national-security threats and First Amendment-protected activity. The broadness of the language suggests that the lines could get blurred between left-wing extremist groups and advocacy groups for left-aligned policies.\n\nNational-security intelligence analyst: The bureau is still dealing with the reputation it acquired under Hoover, when he oversaw a vast domestic surveillance network and the F.B.I. maintained dossiers on huge numbers of people not suspected of crimes. The malfeasance of the ’60s and ’70s is really drilled into us at Quantico. I think a lot of people reading Bondi’s memo very reasonably interpreted it as meaning they want a return to Hoover. I know that across the institution, people are very uncomfortable with that language.\n\n“People that I worked with in the counterintelligence program were very upset about a lot of the investigative tools being taken away.”\n\nAs the Trump administration approached its one-year mark, Patel promoted the bureau’s success in fighting crime under his leadership. On X, he claimed a “100% increase” in year-to-year arrests and a “210% increase” in the disruption of gangs and criminal enterprises. “This FBI is saving lives,” he wrote, “protecting innocent kids, and taking deadly drugs off our streets at levels not seen in decades.”\n\nSenior executive 3: The F.B.I. is bilking their numbers. F.B.I. agents are walking around providing support for local police and ICE. If the local police or ICE makes an arrest, the F.B.I. is counting it in their stats. One example I heard: An F.B.I. agent was walking around with a couple cops who arrested someone for shoplifting, and the F.B.I. claimed it as an arrest. It used to be that the main thing that we would capture in our own arrest stats was if the F.B.I. was the lead agency and it was a federal charge. It hurts me to say it, but they’re bullshit numbers.\n\nCentral U.S. case agent: Let’s say the Highway Patrol pulls somebody over. There’s a gun in the car. Well, then all of a sudden an F.B.I. car shows up, a D.E.A. car shows up, an A.T.F. car shows up. They run the gun and see if it’s stolen. They run the person and see if he’s a felon. Oh, he’s a felon? OK, great. Now the F.B.I. and the A.T.F. and the D.E.A. are all going to say that they got an arrest because they showed up just to balloon the numbers.\n\nField Office Leader 1: When you make F.B.I. agents street cops, you get street-cop numbers. We didn’t used to count immigration arrests, because we didn’t do immigration. Now we do. We didn’t do street patrols in D.C. in the past. Now we do.\n\nIn the past, we mostly worked the complex investigations the F.B.I. is famous for. Complicated work with wires and sophisticated techniques — all aimed at taking out the entire criminal enterprises or national security threats. Now, under Kash, we are counting stuff that has been historically left to local police departments and other agencies and saying, Wow, look at us.\n\n(An F.B.I. spokesman disputed these accounts. “The FBI ONLY counts state arrests when we work cases jointly from partners,” he wrote. “Since becoming director, Patel’s focus has been on partner engagements and joint operations, we do it together.”)\n\nIn the days after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis, the Trump administration blocked state and local officials from reviewing the evidence. Justice Department officials, including Patel, steered the F.B.I. away from a civil rights investigation into whether the ICE agent used excessive force. Instead, Patel ordered an investigation into local activist groups and Good’s wife. Six federal prosecutors resigned in protest. The Justice Department also began criminally investigating Democratic officials in the state, including Governor Tim Walz and the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey.\n\nDavid Sundberg, former assistant director in charge of the Washington field office: The F.B.I. has closed and cleared civil rights investigations without officers being charged when there’s no evidence to substantiate a charge. The way to ascertain the truth is to conduct a fair and impartial investigation. But when government officials communicate on social media about their perception of the events, and many agents have been fired over the outcome of cases they worked, that could have negative impact on this investigation.\n\nJill Fields, former supervisory intelligence analyst for violent crime in the Los Angeles field office: I’ve seen multiple videos of protesters being arrested who aren’t impeding immigration enforcement. Yes, they’re yelling, they’re taunting, but that’s their right. This is what I was worried about and why I pushed back when the L.A. office was asked to investigate protesters last year. It was unthinkable to me then, and now it’s happening. If you start arresting or investigating people for exercising their First Amendment rights, then they don’t have those rights.\n\nThe F.B.I. will literally open an investigation into a bureau car accident, so the idea that they haven’t opened a civil rights investigation after an agent-involved shooting — that’s shocking.\n\nChristopher Raia, a career agent who was previously in charge of the New York field office, was named to replace Bongino, who stepped down in December. Raia shares the role of deputy director with Andrew Bailey, a former Missouri attorney general who moved to the F.B.I. in September. Later, Raia posted on X: “I know the FBI will continue to accomplish great things in the year ahead.”\n\nMichael Feinberg, former assistant special agent in charge of the field office in Norfolk, Va.: ​​What I feel is not just disappointment at the way Patel and Bongino have changed the bureau. The feeling I have more is unremitting anger at the executives who have taken an oath to the Constitution and are making moral compromises on a daily basis to advance their careers. I know some of them are undoubtedly thinking that we need to make some compromises in order to save the F.B.I. as an institution. But the F.B.I. doesn’t matter because it exists as a building on Pennsylvania Avenue. The F.B.I. matters because of the ideals and principles it is supposed to uphold. And if the building continues to exist but those principles and ideals are thrown aside, the victory in saving the F.B.I. has been completely Pyrrhic.\n\nKayla Staph, former cyber special agent: I resigned when it became clear to me that F.B.I. leadership was undermining the bureau’s mission and pursuit of justice. But I don’t expect anyone to make the same decision that I did. I have the most profound respect for my colleagues that are still there.

    "description": "All complex correlated systems, from Arctic melt ponds to the Internet, appear to be governed by the same math as a random matrix.",
    "fullText": "In 1999, while sitting at a bus stop in Cuernavaca, Mexico, a Czech physicist named Petr Šeba noticed young men handing slips of paper to the bus drivers in exchange for cash. It wasn’t organized crime, he learned, but another shadow trade: Each driver paid a “spy” to record when the bus ahead of his had departed the stop. If it had left recently, he would slow down, letting passengers accumulate at the next stop. If it had departed long ago, he sped up to keep other buses from passing him. This system maximized profits for the drivers. And it gave Šeba an idea.\n\n“We felt here some kind of similarity with quantum chaotic systems,” explained Šeba’s co-author, Milan Krbálek, in an email.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to talk to the spies himself, Šeba asked his student to explain to them that he wasn’t a tax collector, or a criminal — he was simply a “crazy” scientist willing to trade tequila for their data. The men handed over their used papers. When the researchers plotted thousands of bus departure times on a computer, their suspicions were confirmed: The interaction between drivers caused the spacing between departures to exhibit a distinctive pattern previously observed in quantum physics experiments.\n\n“I was thinking that something like this could come out, but I was really surprised that it comes exactly,” Šeba said.\n\nSubatomic particles have little to do with decentralized bus systems. But in the years since the odd coupling was discovered, the same pattern has turned up in other unrelated settings. Scientists now believe the widespread phenomenon, known as “universality,” stems from an underlying connection to mathematics, and it is helping them to model complex systems from the Internet to Earth’s climate.\n\nThe pattern was first discovered in nature in the 1950s in the energy spectrum of the uranium nucleus, a behemoth with hundreds of moving parts that quivers and stretches in infinitely many ways, producing an endless sequence of energy levels. In 1972, the number theorist Hugh Montgomery observed it in the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, a mathematical object closely related to the distribution of prime numbers. In 2000, Krbálek and Šeba reported it in the Cuernavaca bus system. And in recent years it has shown up in spectral measurements of composite materials, such as sea ice and human bones, and in signal dynamics of the Erdös–Rényi model, a simplified version of the Internet named for Paul Erdös and Alfréd Rényi.\n\nEach of these systems has a spectrum — a sequence like a bar code representing data such as energy levels, zeta zeros, bus departure times or signal speeds. In all the spectra, the same distinctive pattern appears: The data seem haphazardly distributed, and yet neighboring lines repel one another, lending a degree of regularity to their spacing. This fine balance between chaos and order, which is defined by a precise formula, also appears in a purely mathematical setting: It defines the spacing between the eigenvalues, or solutions, of a vast matrix filled with random numbers.\n\n“Why so many physical systems behave like random matrices is still a mystery,” said Horng-Tzer Yau, a mathematician at Harvard University. “But in the past three years, we have made a very important step in our understanding.”\n\n“It seems to be a law of nature,” said Van Vu, a mathematician at Yale University who, with Terence Tao of the University of California, Los Angeles, has proven universality for a broad class of random matrices.\n\nUniversality is thought to arise when a system is very complex, consisting of many parts that strongly interact with each other to generate a spectrum. The pattern emerges in the spectrum of a random matrix, for example, because the matrix elements all enter into the calculation of that spectrum. But random matrices are merely “toy systems” that are of interest because they can be rigorously studied, while also being rich enough to model real-world systems, Vu said. Universality is much more widespread. Wigner’s hypothesis (named after Eugene Wigner, the physicist who discovered universality in atomic spectra) asserts that all complex, correlated systems exhibit universality, from a crystal lattice to the Internet.\n\nThe more complex a system is, the more robust its universality should be, said László Erdös of the University of Munich, one of Yau’s collaborators. “This is because we believe that universality is the typical behavior.”\n\nIn many simple systems, individual components can assert too great an influence on the outcome of the system, changing the spectral pattern. With larger systems, no single component dominates. “It’s like if you have a room with a lot of people and they decide to do something, the personality of one person isn’t that important,” Vu said.\n\nWhenever a system exhibits universality, the behavior acts as a signature certifying that the system is complex and correlated enough to be treated like a random matrix. “This means you can use a random matrix to model it,” Vu said. “You can compute other parameters of the matrix model and use them to predict that the system may behave like the parameters you computed.”\n\nThis technique is enabling scientists to understand the structure and evolution of the Internet. Certain properties of this vast computer network, such as the typical size of a cluster of computers, can be closely estimated by measurable properties of the corresponding random matrix. “People are very interested in clusters and their locations, partially motivated by practical purposes such as advertising,” Vu said.\n\nA similar technique may lead to improvements in climate change models. Scientists have found that the presence of universality in features similar to the energy spectrum of a material indicates that its components are highly connected, and that it will therefore conduct fluids, electricity or heat. Conversely, the absence of universality may show that a material is sparse and acts as an insulator. In new work presented in January at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego, Calif., Ken Golden, a mathematician at the University of Utah, and his student, Ben Murphy, used this distinction to predict heat transfer and fluid flow in sea ice, both at the microscopic level and through patchworks of Arctic melt ponds spanning thousands of kilometers.\n\nThe spectral measure of a mosaic of melt ponds, taken from a helicopter, or a similar measurement taken of a sample of sea ice in an ice core, instantly exposes the state of either system. “Fluid flow through sea ice governs or mediates very important processes that you need to understand in order to understand the climate system,” Golden said. “The transitions in the eigenvalue statistics presents a brand new, mathematically rigorous approach to incorporating sea ice into climate models.”\n\nThe same trick may also eventually provide an easy test for osteoporosis. Golden, Murphy and their colleagues have found that the spectrum of a dense, healthy bone exhibits universality, while that of a porous, osteoporotic bone does not.\n\n“We’re dealing with systems where the ‘particles’ can be on the millimeter or even on the kilometer scale,” Murphy said, referring to the systems’ component parts. “It’s amazing that the same underlying mathematics describes both.”\n\nThe reason a real-world system would exhibit the same spectral behavior as a random matrix may be easiest to understand in the case of the nucleus of a heavy atom. All quantum systems, including atoms, are governed by the rules of mathematics, and specifically by those of matrices. “That’s what quantum mechanics is all about,” said Freeman Dyson, a retired mathematical physicist who helped develop random matrix theory in the 1960s and 1970s while at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study. “Every quantum system is governed by a matrix representing the total energy of the system, and the eigenvalues of the matrix are the energy levels of the quantum system.”\n\nThe matrices behind simple atoms, such as hydrogen or helium, can be worked out exactly, yielding eigenvalues that correspond with stunning precision to the measured energy levels of the atoms. But the matrices corresponding to more complex quantum systems, such as a uranium nucleus, quickly grow too thorny to grasp. According to Dyson, this is why such nuclei can be compared to random matrices. Many of the interactions inside uranium — the elements of its unknown matrix — are so complex that they become washed out, like a mélange of sounds blending into noise. Consequently, the unknown matrix that governs the nucleus behaves like a matrix filled with random numbers, and so its spectrum exhibits universality.\n\nScientists have yet to develop an intuitive understanding of why this particular random-yet-regular pattern, and not some other pattern, emerges for complex systems. “We only know it from calculations,” Vu said. Another mystery is what it has to do with the Riemann zeta function, whose spectrum of zeros exhibits universality. The zeros of the zeta function are closely tied to the distribution of the prime numbers — the irreducible integers out of which all others are constructed. Mathematicians have long wondered at the haphazard way in which the primes are sprinkled along the number line from one to infinity, and universality offers a clue. Some think there may be a matrix underlying the Riemann zeta function that is complex and correlated enough to exhibit universality. Discovering such a matrix would have “big implications” for finally understanding the distribution of the primes, said Paul Bourgade, a mathematician at Harvard.\n\nOr perhaps the explanation lies deeper still. “It may happen that it is not a matrix that lies at the core of both Wigner’s universality and the zeta function, but some other, yet undiscovered, mathematical structure,” Erdös said. “Wigner matrices and zeta functions may then just be different representations of this structure.”\n\nMany mathematicians are searching for the answer, with no guarantee that there is one. “Nobody imagined that the buses in Cuernavaca would turn out to be an example of this. Nobody imagined that the zeroes of the zeta function would be another example,” Dyson said. “The beauty of science is it’s completely unpredictable, and so everything useful comes out of surprises.”\n\nThis article was reprinted on Wired.com.",

    "fullText": "Finland has issued stricter guidelines for children’s use of digital gadgets, including the call for a ban on the use of social media or smartphones for under-13s. The new rules, drawn up by the Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) and the National Agency for Education, were published on Thursday.\n\nThe agencies recommend that children under the age of 13 should not have smartphones of their own or be allowed to use social media. The recommendations cover youngsters’ free time, not homework or other school-related tasks.\n\nFor younger kids, no screen time at all is recommended for children aged under the age of two, with a maximum of one hour of screen time daily for those aged 2–10, rising to two hours for kids aged 11–13.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, age limits for games, TV shows, videos and films must be followed to avoid exposure to harmful content.\n\nThe recommendations are stricter than a draft version published last autumn, which only referred to banning social media. That attracted an exceptionally large number of comments from parents – more than 6,000 of them – most of whom supported the restrictions. Researchers and experts also urged stricter recommendations.\n\nThe THL plans to develop recommendations for 14–18-year-olds later this year.\n\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo (NCP) has also called for a ban on social media for children under the age of 15. His office is preparing a preliminary report on the matter.\n\nAccording to Yle sources, the government aims to proceed with the matter as quickly as possible. The legislative term ends in the spring of 2027.\n\nIt's about time, says Silja Kosola, an associate professor in adolescent medicine who has researched the impact of social media.\n\n\"We’ve had an uncontrolled human experiment going on. Finland has been a digitally savvy nation, and we have given phones to exceptionally young children. I’m not aware of any other country where first graders have had their own smartphones,\" Kosola told Yle.\n\nAccording to Kosola, the responsibility for restricting social media should not be left solely to parents. She warns of the Danish model, which aims to ban social media for those under 15, but allows 13-year-olds to use it with parental permission.\n\n\"That actually means the age limit is lower, and the whole idea is watered down. It’s really important that the same age limit really applies to everyone,\" Kosola said.",

Chair Andrea Lucas and recently-installed Commissioner Brittany Panuccio cited Trump’s executive order issued last year — in which he decreed there are two immutable sexes, male and female — as one of the reasons for revoking the document.\n\nLucas emphasized at the beginning of Thursday’s meeting that the commission’s decision to rescind the guidance “will not leave a void where employers are free to harass wherever they see fit, leaving a trail of victims in their wake,” citing several recent examples of settled harassment cases. And Panuccio said that private sector resources on anti-harassment law would fill in any gaps.\n\nBut critics argue that all workers will now be more vulnerable to harassment without the EEOC guidance. Kalpana Kotagal, the lone Democrat on the commission, likened it to “throwing out the baby with the bathwater.” She voted against getting rid of it.\n\n“At the height of the #MeToo movement, millions bravely came forward to share their stories, exposing harassment as an abuse of power,” Kotagal said. “The EEOC rose to the occasion by promulgating the guidance being rescinded today, which strives to make workplaces safer for everyone.”\n\nThe EEOC received more than 35,000 harassment complaints in fiscal year 2024.\n\nThe agency updated its guidance on workplace harassment in April 2024 under President Joe Biden for the first time in 25 years following a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination. Lucas voted against the guidance at that time, citing her opposition to language warning employers against deliberately misgendering transgender employees or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity.\n\n“It is neither harassment nor discrimination for a business to draw distinctions between the sexes in providing single-sex bathrooms or other similar facilities which implicate these significant privacy and safety interests,” Lucas wrote in a 2024 statement dissenting to the guidance.\n\nThe agency under Lucas’s leadership has been aggressively paring back protections for transgender workers, dropping lawsuits on their behalf as well as requiring heightened scrutiny for incoming complaints related to gender identity.\n\nWorkers’ groups have voiced strong opposition to removing the EEOC’s harassment guidance. Led by the National Women’s Law Center, more than 80 organizations signed a letter urging Lucas to preserve it.\n\nA few dozen protesters clustered outside the EEOC building on Thursday morning before the meeting, holding signs demanding “hands off the EEOC” and waving flags bearing the blue-and-yellow equality logo for LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign.\n\n“The fact that they’re taking this majorly in-depth guidance that is so worker-centered and they’re just chucking it all is such a slap in the face,” said Kate Miceli, a protester who previously worked at the Women’s Bureau at the Department of Labor.\n\nA group of 12 former EEOC and Department of Labor officials said withdrawing the whole document deprives “employers of a clear blueprint for creating and maintaining a harassment-free workplace and complying with anti-discrimination laws.” The group, called EEO Leaders, in a Jan. 20 statement also criticized the chair for depriving the public of the chance to weigh in on the decision by foregoing a notice and comment period.\n\nThe agency received more than 38,000 comments and public opinions during the yearslong process of developing the 2024 guidance. ________\n\nThe Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

    "description": "Record-breaking experiment shows that a cluster of thousands of atoms can act like a wave as well as a particle.",
    "fullText": "Schrödinger’s cat just got a little bit fatter. Physicists have created the largest ever ‘superposition’ — a quantum state in which an object exists in a haze of possible locations at once.\n\nA team based at the University of Vienna put individual clusters of around 7,000 atoms of sodium metal some 8 nanometres wide into a superposition of different locations, each spaced 133 nanometres apart. Rather than shoot through the experimental set up like a billiard ball, each chunky cluster behaved like a wave, spreading out into a superposition of spatially distinct paths and then interfering to form a pattern researchers could detect.\n\n“It’s a fantastic result,” says Sandra Eibenberger-Arias, a physicist at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin.\n\nQuantum theory doesn’t put a limit on how big a superposition can be, but everyday objects clearly do not behave in a quantum way, she explains. This experiment — which puts an object as massive as a protein or small virus particle into a superposition — is helping to answer the “big, almost philosophical question of ‘is there a transition between the quantum and classical?’,” she says. The authors “show that, at least for clusters of this size, quantum mechanics is still valid”.\n\nThe experiment, described in Nature on 21 January1, is of practical importance, too, says Giulia Rubino, a quantum physicist at the University of Bristol, UK. Quantum computers will ultimately need to maintain perhaps millions of objects in a large quantum state to perform useful calculations. If nature were to make systems collapse past a certain point, and that scale was smaller than what is needed to make a quantum computer, “then that’s problematic”, she says.\n\nPhysicists have long debated how the classical, everyday world emerges from an underlying quantum one. Quantum theory “never states it stops working above a certain mass or size”, says Sebastian Pedalino, a physicist at the University of Vienna and a co-author of the study.\n\nIn 1935, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger showed the absurdity of common interpretations of quantum mechanics with his famous cat-based thought experiment. The cat is put into a box with vial of poison, which will be released if a radioactive atom decays. If the box remains isolated from its environment, the atom exists in a superposition of both decayed and not-decayed, and until observed, the cat is an undefined state of both dead and alive.\n\nIn the real world, objects eventually become too complex or interact too much to maintain a superposition, an idea known as decoherence. But there are also extensions to quantum mechanics, known as collapse theories, that suggest that beyond a certain point, a system will inevitably reduce to a classical state, even in isolation. These theories were picked by 4% of researchers as their favourite interpretation of quantum mechanics in a 2025 Nature survey. “The only way to answer this question is by scaling up” quantum experiments, says Rubino.\n\nTo do this, Pedalino and his team generated a beam of clusters at 77 degrees kelvin (−196 ºC) in an ultra-high vacuum. The researchers put the beam through an interferometer consisting of three gratings constructed with laser beams. The first channelled the clusters through narrow gaps, from which they spread out and travelled in sync as waves; they then passed through a second set of slits that made the waves interfere in a distinctive pattern, which could be detected using the final grating.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00177-9\n\nRead the related News & Views: Quantum effect observed for biggest objects yet\n\nPedalino, S. et al.

    "fullText": "Lululemon is telling customers who buy their see-through leggings to cover up.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Thursday, Lululemon said that it had temporarily paused online sales of its \"Get Low\" collection in North America last week to \"review early guest feedback and insights.\"\n\nIt then updated its product information to incorporate new guidance on fit, sizing, and features, and the collection is now back online, the statement said.\n\nIn the fit and sizing section of the product listing, the athleisure company recommends pairing the leggings with \"skin-tone, seamless underwear,\" per checks of the website by Business Insider.\n\nIt also advises customers to size up the leggings to \"experience this tight's best performance during your workout.\"\n\nSeveral customer reviews on the \"Get Low\" tights listing talk about how they are not squat-proof and are see-through in the glute area. They retail for $108, are high-rise, and free of the front seam problem that's plagued Lululemon in the past.\n\nLululemon's statement comes after its founder, Chip Wilson, slammed the company's board for the \"Get Low\" tights on Wednesday, calling it a \"total operational failure.\"\n\n\"It is clear that persistent failures like this are born out of this Board's lack of experience in creative businesses, disinterest in product development and quality, and focus on short-term, self-interested priorities,\" Wilson said in a LinkedIn post.\n\nWilson left the company's board in 2015 and has since criticized the leadership on multiple occasions.\n\nLululemon has faced backlash in the past for selling see-through tights.\n\nIn 2013, Lululemon pulled back 17% of all its pants for being too sheer, and blamed the manufacturing error on an incomplete testing protocol.\n\nLululemon's stock price reacted favorably to the collection going back online. It rose about 2.5% on Thursday. However, it's down almost 50% in the past year.",

Two of the people said the company is expected to eliminate a similar number of roles in the coming round, bringing total job cuts to almost 30,000.\n\nThe latest cuts underscore Amazon's continued efforts to streamline operations and reset its culture.\n\nAmazon first attributed the October job cuts to changes brought on by AI. But CEO Andy Jassy later said the layoffs were instead tied to cultural fit, not cost savings or AI.\n\nAmazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce makes up a relatively small share, at about 350,000.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "OpenAI has pulled in a billion-dollar month from something other than ChatGPT.\n\nSam Altman said in a post on X on Thursday that OpenAI added more than $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in the past month \"just from our API business.\"\n\n\"People think of us mostly as ChatGPT, but the API team is doing amazing work!\" the OpenAI CEO wrote.\n\nOpenAI's API enables other companies and developers to embed its models into their own products, from internal productivity software to coding tools.\n\nMany of Silicon Valley's high-profile startups rely on OpenAI's models as core infrastructure. Perplexity uses OpenAI's models to power parts of its AI search and answer engine. Harvey, one of the fastest-growing legal tech startups, is built on OpenAI's models to assist lawyers with research and drafting.\n\nAltman's comments underscore how OpenAI's infrastructure business is emerging as a key growth engine, even as the company faces massive costs for computing power and data centers.\n\nThose pressures have pushed OpenAI to look beyond consumer subscriptions.\n\nLast week, the company said it is gearing up to test ads inside ChatGPT as it faces about $1.4 trillion in spending commitments over the coming years.\n\nIt's a notable shift for a company that once treated ads as taboo. Less than two years ago, Altman said advertising was a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nSince then, Altman has struck a more open tone. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't \"totally against\" ads, though he stressed it would need to be approached carefully.\n\nEarlier this week, OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, raised the idea of \"licensing models\" that would let the company share in downstream sales if a customer's product succeeds.\n\n\"Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales,\" Friar said in an episode of \"The OpenAI Podcast\" published Monday.",

    "description": "Goldie Hawn, who has been married twice before, said she's learned that traditional ideas of partnership don't work for her.",
    "fullText": "Goldie Hawn, 80, says there's one reason her relationship with Kurt Russell has lasted more than four decades without marriage.\n\n\"Freedom. And I really feel this way, and I always have. And even if we did get married, it wouldn't make any difference because it's 42 years now,\" Hawn told host Dan Buettner on Thursday's episode of \"The Dan Buettner Podcast.\"\n\nHawn likened the experience to being a bird in a cage.\n\n\"If I'm a bird and you leave the cage door open, I may never fly out. But if you close that door, for my freedom and my independence, I would probably take, like, all my feathers off,\" Hawn said. \"It's a freedom of self, it's a freedom of basically, not melding into somebody else.\"\n\nHawn and her partner, Russell, met for the first time in 1966 and reconnected in 1983 after being cast in the romance drama \"Swing Shift.\" They started dating shortly after, and welcomed one son, Wyatt Russell, together in 1986.\n\nTheir blended family includes Russell's son, Boston, from his marriage to Season Hubley, and Hawn's children, Oliver and Kate Hudson, from her previous relationship with Bill Hudson.\n\nHawn, who has been married twice before, said she's learned that traditional ideas of partnership don't work for her.\n\n\"But, man, this whole idea of becoming one is not my idea of fun. That's why it works,\" she said.\n\nHawn said she and Russell share a strong bond, and accept that there will be parts of each other they don't love. But she doesn't see those imperfections as a good enough reason to walk away from the relationship.\n\n\"Why is that a reason to break up? Why is that a reason to say this isn't working?\" Hawn said.\n\n\"You might not like it, but is that a reason to suddenly decide that this isn't working for me?\" she continued.\n\nWhen Buettner asked why she keeps choosing Russell, Hawn listed several reasons.\n\n\"Because I have respect for him. Because I think he's an amazing person. I'm also very sexually attracted to him, and that's important,\" Hawn said, adding that he's smart and makes her laugh.\n\nShe also praised his talent and appearance.\n\n\"He's such a great actor, and I find him incredibly handsome to this day,\" she said.\n\nHawn added that they're \"an unbelievably happy family most of the time,\" despite their own individual flaws.\n\n\"Why would I want anybody who is perfect? There is no such thing,\" she said.\n\nHawn has long spoken about what she believes makes her relationship with Russell last. In 2024, she told E! News that \"good sex\" is a key part of it.\n\n\"Because sex is something that connects you and creates more belonging. People who have healthy sexual relationships usually last a lot longer. But it's not just because of the act, it's because of the warmth and the intimacy that it creates,\" she said.\n\nRussell has also shared his perspective on their decision not to marry.\n\n\"At that time, we constantly got asked, 'When are you going to get married? Why aren't you married?' And we were like, 'Why does anybody care about that?' We'd asked our kids if they cared about it. They didn't. We didn't,\" Russell told Variety in a 2023 interview.\n\nOther celebrities have also shared their own tips for making relationships last.\n\nIn 2024, Bette Midler told Entertainment Tonight that sleeping in separate bedrooms is the reason her marriage has lasted over 40 years.\n\n\"My husband snores,\" Midler said.\n\nIn 2025, Food Network star Ina Garten said her almost 60-year marriage works because they make decisions together.\n\n\"And this is what Jeffrey taught me: Let's figure out how we can both do what we want to do. It's not about whether we get to do what you want to do or I want to do,\" Garten said, referring to her husband, Jeffrey Garten.",

    "fullText": "TikTok's US workers can finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nThe company announced Thursday that it has closed a deal to spin off parts of its US business in a new joint venture with an investor group.\n\n\"The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the US,\" the company said.\n\nAdam Presser is leading the new venture, according to the company's announcement. Presser has worked at TikTok for nearly four years, most recently leading operations and trust and safety. The venture's seven-man, majority-American board includes TikTok's CEO Shou Chew.\n\nThe agreement should keep the US government off its back as TikTok's parent, ByteDance, now owns just under 20% of the new US venture. That ownership stake meets a divestment requirement set by a 2024 US sell-or-ban law targeting TikTok and other apps with owners based in countries like China, which the US has deemed a foreign adversary.\n\nTikTok's new US owners include tech company Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX, each of which owns 15% of the new venture. ByteDance will own around 20% of the entity, and affiliates of existing ByteDance investors will own around 30%, according to a December memo from Chew. Other investors include Michael Dell's family office and a venture run by the partners of growth investor Dragoneer.\n\nWhile Oracle, MGX, and Silver Lake will serve as managing investors in the new US joint venture, their focus will be on areas such as data security. Key commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will remain with ByteDance.\n\nThe company began splitting up its US staff into different legal entities in January based on whether their work would remain under ByteDance's purview, Business Insider first reported.\n\nFollowing the announcement, President Donald Trump said in a Thursday night Truth Social post that he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok.\"\n\nHe said the deal had reached a \"very dramatic, final, and beautiful conclusion.\"\n\nThe deal has been in the works for a year. At the start of Trump's presidency, TikTok went dark for its 170 million US users, but came back online soon after when Trump promised to delay a ban.\n\nSince then, he has been pushing back the divest-or-ban deadline, saying tech leaders like Elon Musk and Oracle's CTO, Larry Ellison, could buy the app. He also floated giving China a tariff reduction if it cut a deal on TikTok.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia is building roughly 500 Iranian-designed drones a day.\n\nHis comments at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, are a rare public assessment from Ukrainian leaders about Russia's drone-making capacity and provide some insight into how Kyiv sees the balance of power in its long-range drone fight.\n\nZelenskyy has said repeatedly that Ukraine is building 1,000 interceptor drones — small quadcopters designed to counter other flying drones — every day.\n\n\"We produce them at about 1,000 a day. We really produce them, but it's not enough. It's still not enough,\" he told his audience in Davos. \"Russia has 500, about 500 drones, Iranian drones, each day, and dozens of missiles, ballistic missiles.\"\n\nIranian drones refer to Russia's Geran family of loitering munitions, which are mostly based on the Iranian Shahed, a delta-wing drone designed to carry explosive warheads at long range. Because their designs are so closely related, Ukrainians often use their names interchangeably.\n\nThese drones have been a major pain point for Ukraine, which is frequently bombarded by hundreds of Gerans and decoy drones at a time from across Russia's border.\n\nLast week, Ukraine's commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russia is likely aiming to scale up its drone-making capacity to 1,000 Gerans per day.\n\nHe added that Russia is already building 404 Shaheds of \"various types\" per day.\n\nZelenskyy's latest comment also provides clues about the battlefield conditions for Ukraine's new type of air defense with interceptor drones.\n\nThe Ukrainian president's figures imply that his country is fielding twice as many interceptors as Russia's Shaheds, but that a 2:1 ratio isn't sufficient to protect his country's skies.\n\nFor now, interceptor drones in Ukraine are mostly controlled by human pilots, who have the difficult task of maneuvering lightweight quadcopters — sometimes in strong winds or poor weather — to chase down a flying target at speeds of over 100 mph in the vast sky.\n\nEarlier this week, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine also risks running short of interceptor drone pilots and told his government to prioritize recruiting and training more of them.\n\nThe Kremlin has been increasingly developing versions of Gerans with new features, such as jet engines to replace propellers or additional cameras to help the drone avoid interceptors.\n\nMore recently, Ukraine said Russia has deployed a new type of turbojet Geran that mirrors Iran's Karrar attack drone. Unlike the Shahed, it features a more conventional aircraft design,",

I'm much more visionary and a scientist.\"\n\nHe said his \"mission in life\" was not leadership, but to accelerate technological progress and inspire others to work on what interests them.\n\nIn November, LeCun announced his departure from Meta, where he had worked for 12 years, and said he would launch his own AI company.\n\nHis new startup, AMI Labs, focuses on building world models — a type of AI that closely reflects the real world. The Paris-based startup will work on open source solutions and be among the few frontier AI labs that he said are \"neither Chinese nor American.\"\n\nLeCun said that he would take on the role of executive chairman, while Alex LeBrun, his former colleague from Meta AI, will be the company's CEO. LeCun will continue teaching at NYU.\n\nIn the MIT interview, the AI pioneer said that he did not agree with all the choices Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made, such as letting go the robotics team inside FAIR.\n\nEarlier this month, he criticized the leadership of another Meta exec, Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data labelling startup Scale AI. Meta invested $14.3 billion in the buzzy startup, which included hiring Wang to lead AI progress.\n\n\"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher,\" LeCun said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nLeCun said that even though the 28-year-old was briefly his boss after Zuckerberg's AI reorg, he wasn't taking orders from Wang.\n\n\"You don't tell a researcher what to do,\" LeCun said. \"You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.\"\n\nHe also made similar remarks about being a visionary instead of a leader in the FT interview.\n\n\"I'm pretty good at guessing what type of technology will work or not. But I can't be a CEO,\" LeCun, 65, said. \"I'm both too disorganized for this, and also too old.\"",

    "description": "Here’s a roundup of research and predictions for tech workers amid the AI revolution.",
    "fullText": "The tech job market in 2026 is being built on contradictions.\n\nCompanies are laying off staff, insisting artificial intelligence will “do more with less” — yet they haven’t found ways to deploy AI at scale. Recruiters say entry-level pathways are narrowing, but critical roles remain hard to fill.\n\nEven as headlines scream “automation,” the day-to-day reality is messier: Hybrid work is still a dealbreaker, job titles are splintering into new specialties, and workers are being asked to produce more output with fewer resources.\n\nRest of World reviewed recent research on tech job trends in 2026\n\nDeloitte’s 2025 Emerging Technology Trends study noted that while 30% of surveyed organizations are exploring agentic options and 38% are piloting solutions, only 14% have solutions that are ready to be deployed. A mere 11% are actively using these systems in production. Furthermore, 42% of organizations report they are still developing their agentic strategy road map, with 35% having no formal strategy at all.\n\nWhile most human workers are generally comfortable with predictable, rule-based robots, physical AI systems that learn and adapt introduce new uncertainties, especially worries about job displacement. Experts predict, however, that most roles will evolve toward collaboration rather than replacement.\n\nThe goal is to create environments where robots handle repetitive or dangerous tasks while humans focus on creative problem-solving and complex decision-making.\n\nThe best workers want hybrid or remote roles. Yet more companies are demanding full-time in-office attendance. It’s not making hiring any easier.\n\nThe battle lines have been drawn. Companies are demanding people return to the office full-time while workers dig in their heels, insisting they want remote or hybrid work options.\n\nCompanies are demanding people return to office while workers dig in their heels”\n\nAccording to the Korn Ferry report, 52% of talent acquisition leaders say office mandates hinder recruitment, while 72% find remote roles easier to fill.\n\nBusiness leaders might think this is fine right now, but in roles with chronic skills shortages, it’ll rapidly be clear that it’s not fine at all.\n\nIf your employer brand isn’t strong enough to overcome the office requirement, you’ll end up paying premium salaries to attract people who would otherwise work elsewhere. Or worse, you’ll just be filling seats — settling for whoever is willing to show up, not the talent who will move your business forward.\n\nTech recruitment platform Built In\n\nAs companies seek specialists, the emergence of new roles with novel job titles and nuanced skill requirements will be a feature of 2026. As the economy picks up steam, companies will narrow their focus and drift away from broad-spectrum roles with catch-all titles like “software engineer” and “data scientist” toward more tailored, task-specific job titles.\n\nNavigating the future of work in tech this year will involve companies focused more at the intersection of AI-workflow integration, governance, and impact.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move. This comes after Waymo announced another expansion of its robotaxi service in the US, hammering home its lead in the autonomous space — for now.\n\nMusk also claimed on Thursday that he expects the company’s self-driving service to get EU and China approval soon.\n\nTesla stock popped on the news, closing up over 4%.\n\nIn a post on X.com, Musk said Tesla \"started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\" This post came in response to users on X posting videos of the Tesla robotaxi operating without a safety driver.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Waymo, part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), said on its company blog that it is now operating in the Miami area, inviting its first public riders in the city. “With nearly 10,000 residents already signed up, we will be inviting new riders on a rolling basis to ensure a seamless experience across our initial 60-square-mile service area.”\n\nWaymo says plans for rides to Miami International Airport will be coming soon.\n\nBefore the Miami announcement, Waymo operated in five major US markets: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater San Francisco area.\n\nThis year, Waymo has an aggressive plan to expand, with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Nashville targeted for public service.\n\nIt also has plans for densely populated cities, with testing ongoing in New York, Tokyo, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's autonomous and robotaxis services are lagging. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk claimed the company’s full self-driving (FSD) autonomous service, a supervised product that requires users to pay attention while using it, would soon be coming to Europe and China.\n\n\"We hope to ​get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for China,\" Musk ‍said.\n\nWhile Waymo currently is only testing internationally in the cities mentioned above, its service is level 4 autonomous, which is fully autonomous in certain geographic areas. Tesla’s FSD is considered level 2.\n\nTesla’s robotaxis, currently operating in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, have grown in numbers but only modestly. The robotaxis still require a safety driver in each vehicle, owing to the fact that it is still a supervised service. The new video shared by Musk suggests the company has approval to operate without a safety driver in Austin, but the CEO didn't share whether that was the case.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "description": "It's been with us for a while.",
    "fullText": "The first known outbreak of syphilis in Europe began at the turn of the 16th century, but on the distant continent of South America, the pathogen's history goes much deeper than that.\n\nA 5,500-year-old skeleton discovered at an archaeological site in Colombia has now offered up DNA from the spiral-shaped bacterium Treponema pallidum.\n\nThis strain, called TE1-3, is not in circulation today, but based on its genome, it belongs to a very old branch, or an \"early-diverging sister lineage\" of T. pallidum.\n\nIt seems to have split off before other subspecies responsible for diseases like syphilis, yaws, bejel, and pinta emerged and spread around the world.\n\nThe discovery, led by evolutionary genomics researcher Davide Bozzi, pushes back the evidence for treponemal diseases, as they're known, by roughly 3,000 years.\n\nIt also points to an origin for syphilis in the Americas rather than in Europe, adding to growing genetic evidence elsewhere in South and Central America.\n\nIn Europe, the first outbreaks of syphilis occurred just after the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus returned from his journey to the Americas, and as a result, the two events have been historically tied together – a knot firmly tightened by racist and xenophobic ideologies about the way diseases spread.\n\nToday, genomic researchers are picking apart these deep and twisted roots using ancient DNA. Growing evidence from ancient bones suggests that syphilis-like diseases were present in the Americas long before their likeness emerged in Europe.\n\nIt's unknown whether TE1-3 was spread from human to human via sexual activity, as is the case with syphilis, or by skin-to-skin contact, as is the case with yaws, bejel, and pinta. But based on its genome, this ancient strain possessed virulence genes found in modern versions, which suggests it was harmful – or at least had already adapted to infect human hosts.\n\nBased on their results, Bozzi and colleagues estimate that the divergence between TE1-3 and other T. pallidum lineages occurred roughly 13,700 years ago – well before agricultural expansion in the Americas.\n\nThe findings suggest that contagious diseases were emerging among hunter-gatherer communities before the rise of dense farming populations living close to domesticated animals.\n\n\"Our findings show how even a single ancient pathogen genome can shift current understanding of pathogen emergence,\" the researchers write in their published paper.\n\nBut just because the oldest known evidence for a syphilis-like disease was found in South America doesn't mean it was solely confined to this one continent.\n\nWhile controversial, a subset of scientists working in Europe maintains that treponemal diseases and strains closely related to syphilis were present in Europe centuries before Columbus set sail for the Americas, suggesting that T. pallidum was present on both continents before Columbus's journey connected the two.\n\nBesides, there's even a chance that the expression of syphilis and other treponemal diseases is environmentally and socially determined. In other words, the bacterium may have been present in various populations but began to spread in different ways, and cause variations of the same disease, depending on environmental conditions.\n\nThis means the pathogen behind syphilis may not have been a sexually transmitted infection in pre-Columbian populations in the Americas; it may have later acquired this mode of transmission – and the stigma associated with it – in 15th-century Europe.\n\nWithout more evidence, all of these hypotheses remain possible.\n\nIn a related perspective, anthropologists Molly Zuckerman of Mississippi State University and Lydia Bailey of the US National Museum of Natural History, who were not involved in the recent research, argue that these findings \"make it possible to move beyond simplistic ideas of where diseases geographically come from.\"\n\n\"Framing Treponema origins through geographic binaries, such as 'Old World' versus 'New World,' obscures the ecological realities,\" they continue.\n\n\"Far from static or specific to a human population or environment, pathogens are tethered to mobile human and animal hosts and reservoirs, molded by human experiences and biosocial and environmental conditions, adaptable, and globalized.\"\n\nThe study was published in Science.\n\nScientists Tried to Spread The Flu, Only to Discover Something Unexpected\n\nNot All Sitting Is Equal. One Type Was Just Linked to Better Brain Health.\n\nShingles Vaccine Linked to Slower Biological Aging, Study Finds",

The acquisition was first announced in September 2024.\n\nAt the time, Verizon said in a press release that it aims to accelerate the delivery of its “mobility and broadband services to current and new customers” by purchasing Frontier.\n\nNow that the deal is finalized, Verizon says that its network footprint now reaches 31 states and Washington, D.C., offering “better value and more choices” to millions more customers, according to a new memo from Verizon CEO Dan Schulman.\n\n“Frontier has executed an impressive turnaround, consistently delivering strong results, and the momentum is clear,” said Schulman in the memo. “Our combined strength immediately creates an unparalleled fiber network.”\n\nFrontier has indeed rapidly grown its internet customer base in recent months, following its exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021. During the third quarter of 2025, Frontier added 133,000 new fiber internet customers, reflecting a 20.2% year-over-year increase, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nThe company’s fiber broadband revenue growth also spiked by 25%, compared to the same time period in 2024.\n\nVerizon hopes that this deal will not only help its Fios internet service reach more consumers but also repair its recent wireless customer losses.\n\nIn the third quarter of last year, after implementing price hikes and ending several discounts, Verizon lost 7,000 postpaid phone customers, pushing its churn rate to 0.91%.\n\nThe loss comes at a time when more consumers nationwide are considering switching phone carriers as they battle higher monthly bills, according to a survey from Market Force Information last year.\n\nApproximately 65% of consumers use phone services from the \"Big 3\" carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T, spending over $100 per month on their wireless services.\n\nOn average, Verizon customers pay over $150 for service.\n\nAbout 23% of Verizon customers are considering switching to another carrier in the next year or two, citing better pricing, promotions and coverage as the primary reasons.\n\nVerizon scored 40% in overall brand performance across customer experience metrics.\n\nSmaller wireless carriers such as Consumer Cellular and Mint Mobile scored 73% and 65.8%, respectively.\n\n\"There's a clear shift in the market towards smaller, more agile wireless carriers who are delivering superior customer experiences,\" said David Murray, senior director of client strategy at Market Force Information, in a press release.\n\n\"While cost and coverage are always key factors, today's consumers are placing more importance on ease of service and overall satisfaction with their provider,” he continued.\n\nVerizon hopes that combining its mobile offers with Frontier’s internet service will increase customer loyalty and improve its postpaid phone churn rate by approximately 50%.\n\nVerizon had to jump through hurdles to complete its acquisition of Frontier. In May last year, the wireless carrier cut its diversity, equity and inclusion policies to gain approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the acquisition.\n\nAlso, last week, to secure approval from California state regulators for the acquisition (the final step in finalizing the deal), Verizon vowed to invest in 75,000 new fiber locations and build 25 new wireless towers to expand service in rural areas of the state, according to a recent report from Reuters.\n\nT-Mobile announces free offer for Verizon and AT&T customers\n\n​​Verizon CEO sounds alarm on why customers are leaving in droves\n\nSpectrum raises red flag on cause of fleeing customer problem\n\nVerizon also agreed to provide free internet service to many low‑income households in California for at least 10 years.\n\nIn response to the finalized Verizon and Frontier deal, analysts at S&P Global stated that the acquisition will give cable companies tougher competition.\n\nCable giants, such as Spectrum and Xfinity, have recently been ramping up deals on bundled phone, internet and TV services to attract more customers, posing a major threat to wireless carriers nationwide.\n\n“The transaction, which we view as integral to Verizon’s current identity and future strategy, will enable Verizon to bundle in home broadband and mobile services to a wider footprint to better compete with incumbent cable providers,” said S&P Global analysts William Savage and Allyn Arden in a recent report.",

    "title": "This Tire Brand Has The Lowest Customer Satisfaction Rating, According To Consumer Reports",
    "description": "Checking reviews for specific brands can help you avoid a headache when buying tires for your car, and this brand has particularly low satisfaction scores.",
    "fullText": "Purchasing new tires for your car, truck, or SUV is rarely a satisfying event. One might even argue that it is one of the more frustrating undertakings a vehicle owner will endure, as purchasing tires from even one of the more trusted manufacturers in the game doesn't guarantee you're going to get the results you want. And yes, on top of that inherent risk, you'll likely be expected to pay an arm and a leg for a set of four new tires to boot.\n\nThere are, of course, a few helpful tips and tricks you can follow to lessen the frustration of purchasing new tires. But you should also consult consumer ratings factions like Consumer Reports, which not only undertakes regular tests and rankings of various tire brands and models, but also conducts surveys with real customers about each. In the latter case, CR recently sought to rank several major tire brands via one of the more potentially damning market metrics — customer satisfaction.\n\nPer Consumer Reports, the aspects of new tires prized most by shoppers are their ability to grip the road in inclement weather, overall smoothness and handling, and the lifespan of their tread. If you're in the market for a satisfying All-Season tire, Uniroyal appears to be the brand that you need to avoid the most, as it's rated dead last in terms of satisfaction. To that end, you should also avoid All-Season tires from Sumitomo, Kelly, Dunlop, and a few other budget brands.\n\nYes, Uniroyal was rated at the bottom of Consumer Reports' recent ranking of the most satisfying All-Season tire brands, though several other budget offerings were also listed in the red for the same category. Unfortunately for the Michelin-owned tire maker, it also landed last in customer satisfaction when it comes to its Winter/Snow tire offerings. Sumitomo, Kelly, Hercules, GT Radial, Dunlop, and, surprisingly, BF Goodrich were also rated red by unsatisfied customers in that category.\n\nIn the Summer tire category, Sumitomo was the worst rated tires for customer satisfaction, with the budget brand making the unfortunate claim of being at, or very near the bottom of the list in all four categories surveyed for the Consumer Reports rankings. The last of those lists is the All-Terrain category, which also saw Sumitomo earn the lowest marks for customer satisfaction. On aggregate, that would seem to make the budget Japanese brand the least-loved of those surveyed for the CR report, signaling that any satisfaction you might feel regarding the price of Sumitomo tires at the point of purchase may erode with a quickness once you're on the road.\n\nIf you're curious about which brand fared best on the Consumer Reports satisfaction list, Michelin Tires earned the highest rating of light green in all four categories surveyed. It was the only manufacturer to claim that honor. However, the European tire brand Vredestein was also rated well in all categories, earning light green marks in the All-Season, Winter/Snow, and Summer tire categories, and a dark green rating in the All-Terrain sector.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

I'm Cuban, and my best friend is a Black man. We drove down to visit my family and go to Disney World in the summer of 2024, and we were legit scared to stop for lunch or bathroom breaks. And when we did, we were SO careful, because we were genuinely terrified of being harassed, shot, or both.\"\n\n\"Second, the culture and the arts. It is impossible to match the museums and high arts of large cities in blue states, but there are good orchestras and regional arts to enjoy everywhere.

It's completely secular; there are no religious requirements, and no judgment. Coming from one of those 'poor-people-don’t-deserve-cookies' places, it’s an absolute breath of fresh air. Books, too.

    "description": "Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider won the 2026 PFWA Executive Of The Year award today.",
    "fullText": "Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider won the PFWA Executive Of The Year award today.\n\nThe Professional Football Writers of America put out a press release Thursday announcing their on field awards, in which Schneider was named as the winner. He’s the first Seahawk to win the award since it was created in 1993. He’s been a strong candidate in many of his 17 years in charge, with the team having three different eras of success within the timespan- each of which he rebuilt and retooled the roster to major success through all available avenues.\n\nThis doesn’t come as a shock to the Seattle media sphere because of that. Almost every voice covering the Seahawks has called for this to be the year he finally wins. Having the confidence to move off the past coach’s players despite their stardom and leadership allowed him to make the team new and exciting enough to go from good to great. Trading Geno Smith and D.K. Metcalf put him under scrutiny, under which he proved he deserved this year’s award. Ten months later, he’s won it, and has a chance to add a third NFC Championship and a second Super Bowl ring to his resume in the coming weeks.\n\nSchneider’s best trait isn’t just winning trades, though- he’s considered by many around football to be the best personnel guy there is. His draft record is outstanding, littered with Pro Bowlers, Hall of Famers, and other legends. Just this year, Grey Zabel at the 18th pick was exactly what the team needed, Nick Emmanwori at 35 has dictated how the entire NFC can play offense, Tory Horton looked like a steal in the 5th Round before getting hurt, and Robbie Ouzts has become a major contributor. In past years, he’s had some of the best rounds in draft history, selecting All-Pros Devon Witherspoon and Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the first round in 2023, and selecting future Hall of Famers Russell Wilson and Bobby Wagner just 28 picks apart in 2012.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks general manager John Schneider wins Executive Of The Year",

    "description": "The Capitals haven't been able to get much going consistently since Dec. 5, and now, they're trying to find a fix — and fast.",
    "fullText": "It's easy to sense the frustration among the Washington Capitals right now.\n\nAfter dropping their fourth straight game, this time a 4-3 decision to a Vancouver Canucks team that sits last in the standing and had lost 11 straight entering Wednesday's contest, the Capitals were again left looking for answers to issues that have been evident since the start of December.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we're just making too many big mistakes,\" coach Spencer Carbery said postgame after the loss to Vancouver. \"I sound like a broken record, but that's just the reality of it. We're making massive, massive mistakes. And it's throughout — you just can't in this league, it's just too competitive. You just cannot give free goals, and that's what we're doing too much.\"\n\nDiving into the exact struggles, the Capitals' main issues appear to stem at 5-on-5, with special teams seeing a recent boost and even providing D.C. with an early 2-0 lead against the Canucks.\n\nSince Dec. 5, Washington ranks 10th-worst in Corsi-for percentage at 5-on-5 (47.74 and has given up the third-most shots in the NHL over that span (562). Overall, at even strength, lapses in coverage have become an apparent issue, along with inconsistency through 60 minutes.\n\nIt doesn't go unnoticed, or ignored, in the Capitals' dressing room with the standings getting tighter. But as John Carlson pointed out, the team needs to translate those desired changes to the ice.\n\n\"We talk about it ad nauseam,\" John Carlson said of the team's woes. \"We address it, and there's no hiding in here. We know where our games at and what we need, what we expect from each other.\"\n\nHaving watched from up top over the previous eight games due to injury, Tom Wilson noted that Washington's struggles have nothing to do with a lack of trying, but instead, defensive breakdowns that need to be resolved before anything else.\n\n'It’s tough, you’re paying every other night. We gotta defend better, that has nothing to do with the legs or energy, we’re just giving them too many odd-man rushes, we’re giving them too many times where we lose coverage and the guy’s all alone on (our goaltender),\" Wilson said. \"I think we’re going to have to look ourselves in the mirror, defend a little bit better and then from there, we’ll worry about the offensive end once we get there.\"\n\nAs Wilson pointed out, improving from there will help the team's transition game, where Washington can then shift its focus to generating more chemistry and urgency on offense.\n\nNow that the lineup is back to full strength, there should be more consistency in the lines, which will translate to better results. But at the end of the day, it comes down to finishing and getting more on goal, one way or another.\n\n\"(There's) talking about it, and then you got to execute. I think that's the name of the game, is execution,\" Carlson explained. \"Whether it's making the right plays to get out of the zone or making the right plays in the o-zone to get a scoring chance, or when you do get a scoring chance, to bear down and score. I think we need to gather more of those key moments each game, and we got to learn pretty quick.\"\n\nThe Capitals had off Thursday as they traveled to Alberta, where they'll look to end their losing streak and get back on track in a back-to-back against the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers.",

    "description": "On the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback with Ian Begley, SNY's NBA Insider and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype discuss Karl-Anthony Towns trade rumors and potential deadline deals.",
    "fullText": "With the 2026 NBA trade deadline arriving on Feb. 5, there are plenty of questions surrounding the Knicks and their NBA Finals expectations.\n\nNew York snapped their four-game losing streak in an impressive win over the Nets on Wednesday night, but the team is still in the midst of one of its worst stretches in the Jalen Brunson era. With the win, they are 3-9 over their last 12 games and have fallen into the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference -- they would be the four-seed if they didn't hold the tiebreaker over the Raptors.\n\nSo, as the Knicks look to improve the roster, what should fans be looking for? SNY NBA Insider Ian Begley spoke on the topic on the Jan. 22 episode of The Putback, where he and guest Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype broke down what they are hearing as the trade deadline gets closer.\n\nAfter the Knicks' dreadful loss to the undermanned Mavericks at home on Monday, Newsday's Steve Popper reported that New York had spoken to a number of teams (Hornets, Grizzlies, Magic) about a potential trade involving Towns.\n\nTowns' numbers are down pretty much across the board and the big man even admitted that he's had a tough time adjusting to head coach Mike Brown's system.\n\nBegley shared on The Putback what he had heard.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations about trading Karl-Anthony Towns,\" Begley said. \"As of Monday, it was not happening. As far as something in the aftermath of that Dallas loss, no, that wasn’t the case.\"\n\nBegley added that if the Knicks go through another 2-9 stretch and continue to struggle as they get closer to the trade deadline, things might change.\n\nWhenever Towns' name is thrown out there as a trade candidate, the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo is not far behind. It seems like an easy swap for both teams, but Scotto threw some cold water on the idea.\n\n“I personally never gotten the sense, at least from talking to my sources, that a team like the Milwaukee Bucks would be overly aggressive in trying to get Karl Towns in a Giannis Antetokounmpo package, theoretically,\" Scotto said.\n\nScotto suggested that the Knicks, if they were to deal Towns, would have to consider \"breaking up\" Towns' salary into multiple pieces, similar to what the Timberwolves did when they moved the big man to New York for Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo.\n\n\"I checked around on this Monday, everything that I gathered is the Knicks are not having conversations on trading Karl-Anthony Towns\"\n\nOn The Putback with @IanBegley, Ian discusses what he's heard on the KAT reports and his read on if the Knicks would make that trade pic.twitter.com/bvLAdFjzt2\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 22, 2026\n\nSince a Towns trade is unlikely, what players should we be on the lookout for?\n\nGuerschon Yabusele is as likely a candidate to be moved. According to Scotto, the acquisition was seen as a \"homerun\" by execs in the offseason, but it was made before the hiring of Brown. Clearly, Yabusele has had a tough time integrating into Brown's system, and the Knicks are looking to shop him. Scotto even suggested the Knicks may have to pair Yabusele with another minimum-salary player or draft picks to get a player that could help the team.\n\nScotto shared that the Pelicans have two players that the Knicks checked in.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were calling not only on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans but also Yves Missi,\" Scotto said. \"Part of it could be doing background, doing due diligence, but you don't make calls on these guys unless you're intersted so that raised my antenna a little bit. If you take Yabusele and another minimum guy, you could maybe try to make something happen there.\"\n\nThe Knicks' interest in Alvarado is well-documented by Missi is a name that even Begley was surprised by.\n\nMissi, 21, is a second-year center who has seen his minutes deep in year two. In his rookie campaign, Missi played around 27 minutes a game (73 games), averaging nine points, and eight rebounds (3.5 offensive). In his sophomore year, Missi is averaging 19 minutes and just 5.5 points and 5.5 rebounds (2.9 offensive) across 38 games.\n\nAcquiring another big like Missi could open up more avenues for deals involving the Knicks. Would they deal Mitchell Robinson, who is on the final year of his contract, or one of the depth bigs like Ariel Hukporti? That also opens up the possibility to trade Towns as well.\n\nThe Knicks have a lot to consider as they hope to fortify their roster for the final stretch of the regular season and the playoffs.\n\n\"I did hear the Knicks were not only calling on Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans, but also Yves Missi\"\n\nOn today's episode of The Putback, @MikeAScotto - a must-follow for NBA fans - discusses trade deadline (link to full show in post below) pic.twitter.com/11wdozjICd\n\n— Ian Begley (@IanBegley) January 22, 2026",

The Knicks got back in the win column Wednesday with a 120-66 win against the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nBegley believes the Knicks may consider drastic trades if the team has another rough stretch before the Feb. 5 trade deadline.\n\n\"If you see another 2-9 stretch or something like that ahead of the trade deadline, I think that's when you have to consider that, 'Hey, we need to shake something up here,'\" he said.\n\nTowns is averaging 20.8 points, 11.5 rebounds and shooting 46.9% from the field this season. He is in his second season in New York after being acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves before last season.\n\nTowns' max contract is fully guaranteed through the 2027-28 season, making him a difficult player to trade. But the Begley thinks Knicks are intent on keeping him for now.\n\n\"I don't think they're there yet,\" he said. \"They're not out there shopping Karl-Anthony Towns.\"\n\nThe Knicks (26-18) return to action Saturday night against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n76ers' Tyrese Maxey lands signature shoe deal\n\nLakers legend rumored to be involved in 'NBA Europe' project\n\nESPN NBA analyst gives Lakers' season mediocre grade\n\nMichael Jordan's 'NBA on NBC' appearance disappointing for fans\n\nDeMarcus Cousins makes bold claim about LeBron James' future\n\nHeat could keep promising young player for potential Giannis trade",

    "fullText": "GLENDALE – The heavy favorite for the Arizona Cardinals head coaching job seems to be Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph. His ties to the franchise makes him an easy choice to understand why he will be the guy. Despite those reports and betting odds, there is still plenty of candidates vying for the opportunity.\n\nAri Meirov, who covers the NFL for the 33rd team, talked with PHNX Cardinals about other names in the running for the Cardinals job. Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur was a name that Meirov spoke about extensive about the desire to be a head coach in the NFL.\n\nJun 3, 2025; Woodland Hills, CA, USA; Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur at press conference during organized team activities at Rams Practice Facility. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\n“I have a hard time seeing Mike LaFleur not taking a job. He does a lot of work in L.A., a lot of work. He doesn’t call the plays, that’s Sean [McVay’s] job. He’s very, very important there. He learnt a lot from that experience with the [New York] Jets. Which was a difficult situation. He goes back to his buddy in Sean McVay, and it’s a whole new life for him…If you get him now, it might be bumpy at the beginning but eventually these guys will figure it out.”\n\nSep 28, 2025; Inglewood, California, USA; Los Angeles Rams cornerback Cobie Durant (14) and offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur as they get ready for the game against the Indianapolis Colts at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images\n\nWhen the Arizona job first opened, BetOnline had LaFleur as the early favorite for the job. Since then, the lines have change, but his connection with the franchise remains strong. LaFleur is in a similar boat as Joseph, as both of their teams will be competing in a conference championship game on Sunday. One would wonder, if Denver loses on Sunday and Los Angles wins or vice versa, it opens the door for either candidate to get the Cardinals job.\n\nMeirov explained LaFleur’s desire to be a head coach, and with five of the 10 NFL jobs close, his opportunity is running out. The 38-year-old will have to worry about his fellow Rams coaches from taking other opportunities. DC Chris Shula is a strong candidate for the Pittsburgh Steelers job, while Los Angeles’ passing-game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase is the top choice for the Cleveland Browns.\n\nAug 14, 2025; Carson, CA, USA; Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur reacts during a joint practice at the Dignity Health Sports Park. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-Imagn Images\n\nThe Cardinals could swoop in and hire LaFleur to continue expanding McVay’s impressive coaching tree. Liam Coen, Zac Taylor and Kevin O’Connell are just three former coordinators of McVay to become successful head coaches in the NFL. In a tough NFC West, Arizona could try to replicate the magic that Los Angeles has done to revive the franchise.\n\nCardinals go offensive line in Mel Kiper’s 2026 NFL mock draft",

Duranville made his Bundesliga debut in May 2023 against 1. FSV Mainz 05 at the age of 17.\n\nHe subsequently played 15 Bundesliga matches, nine Champions League matches and one DFB-Pokal match against Phönix Lübeck, in which he scored his first competitive goal for Borussia Dortmund. During his time at BVB, Duranville also played two senior international matches for Belgium, for whom he made his debut in September 2024.\n\nBVB sporting director Sebastian Kehl says: “Julien has been with us in Dortmund for three years, but he is still a very young player in whom we continue to see great potential. However, due to injuries, among other things, he has not been able to show his talent and abilities to the extent we would have liked. The move to FC Basel now gives him the opportunity to gain regular playing time and develop further. We are convinced that this is the right step for his future prospects here at BVB.

    "fullText": "The Seattle Mariners signed an interesting - and familiar name - to a minor league deal on Thursday afternoon, coming to terms with former Texas Rangers pitcher Dane Dunning.\n\nThe 31-year-old Dunning was a first-round pick of the Washington Nationals in the 2016 MLB Draft out of the University of Florida. He was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez in 2017 for outfielder Adam Eaton and made his debut with Chicago in 2020. He made just seven appearance for Chicago before getting dealt to Texas for Lance Lynn in the offseason before the 2021 campaign.\n\nFree agent signing: Right-hander Dane Dunning has a minor league deal with the Mariners, per sources.\n\n— Chris Cotillo (@ChrisCotillo) January 22, 2026\n\nDunning went 5-10 for the rebuilding Rangers in 2021, pitching to a 4.51 ERA, and then he went 4-8 in 2022 with a 4.46 ERA in 2022.\n\nHe turned a corner in 2023, going 12-7 with a 3.70 ERA in 35 games (26 starts), helping the Rangers win the World Series over the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2024, he went just 5-7 with a 5.31 ERA and he made only 12 appearances in 2025 between the Rangers and Atlanta Braves, going 0-0 with a 6.97 ERA.\n\nThat's too Dane bad!\n\nStrikeout no. 1 for @Ddunning33! pic.twitter.com/tgNiNZeEzm\n\n— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) August 20, 2020\n\nThere's a few things that it could mean for Seattle, actually.\n\n1) The Mariners figure to have Logan Gilbert, Bryan Woo, Luis Castillo, Bryce Miller and George Kirby in the starting rotation as long as everyone is healthy. With a lot of experience, Dunning is a logical option in case someone is injured in spring training.\n\n2) The Mariners also have Emerson Hancock and Logan Evans to serve as the emergency starters in the system, but if the team decides to keep Hancock as a reliever in 2026, then Dunning likely bumps up a spot. Hancock's role will be important to watch as spring training develops.\n\n3) Perhaps Dunning could become a bullpen option for Seattle. He's made 34 relief appearances in his career.\n\nThe Mariners aren't sending any of their starting rotation to the World Baseball Classic but several top relievers are headed to their national teams, meaning there should be substantial chances for Dunning to get innings in camp, which begins Feb. 12.\n\n--The Mariners had four prospects in the Top 100 of the latest Baseball America rankings. Lazaro Montes was ranked as the No. 9 outfield prospect in the sport by MLB Pipeline.\n\n--Julio Rodriguez was named as the No. 16 player in the game on the MLB Network countdown. Cal Raleigh is in the Top 10, which is revealed on Thursday.\n\nRemember to join our MARINERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "fullText": "Ex-NBA player says dating Khloe Kardashian 'derailed' his career originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer NBA guard Rashad McCants says his brief relationship with Khloe Kardashian came at a cost he believes went far beyond tabloid attention. In his view, the timing and culture of the league during his playing days turned off-court visibility into a professional liability.\n\nMcCants, who was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2005, has said that players in his era were expected to keep a low profile unless they were established superstars. Any perceived distraction, he argues, could quickly be held against someone still trying to secure a foothold in the league.\n\nMORE: Miami fans think adult film star Abella Danger is dating Carson Beck because of a viral fake tweet\n\nSpeaking with Basketball Network’s Nick Raguz, McCants explained how celebrity relationships were viewed differently before the rise of social media and player branding. “Before, it was a distraction,” he said. “The powers didn’t want players doing anything outside of the NBA that would be considered a distraction. You didn’t see a lot of guys dating celebrities unless they were high-profile players.”\n\nAccording to McCants, that distinction mattered. Playing in a small market while dating someone already famous brought scrutiny he felt he couldn’t afford. “For me, not being a high-profile guy and being in Minnesota, it was more of a distraction than a compliment,” he said. “I was one of the early bloomers for all of those things, and it didn’t help my situation.”\n\nOn the court, McCants’ NBA run was short and uneven. Injuries and inconsistent minutes limited his opportunities, and he averaged 9.9 points per game across four seasons with the Timberwolves. As teams turned over rosters and leaned toward younger players, his role diminished, and his NBA career ended after the 2008-09 season.\n\nMORE: Klay Thompson shows up to support Megan Thee Stallion's latest Dunkin promo\n\nThe former guard also pointed to how much the league has changed since then. Today’s NBA encourages players to build brands, embrace social media, and expand their visibility, regardless of market size. In McCants’ telling, that shift highlights how different the environment was when he was trying to establish himself.",

Meanwhile, Piet Scobel’s brace helped Nürnberg to a dramatic 3-2 win over second-placed Elversberg.\n\nHowever, their last four head-to-head games have only resulted in a total of five goals. Darmstadt won the reverse fixture with the only goal of the game coming at the 94th minute from substitute Killian Corredor.\n\nFabian Nürnberger could be back straight into Darmstadt’s starting lineup against his former club Nürnberg.

    "fullText": "Brian Harman was cruising around the Pete Dye Stadium Course Thursday at The American Express when the round started to unravel. The major champion was two under standing in the middle of the par-4 10th fairway and hit an approach shot to inside 10 feet.\n\nThe 39-year-old lefty was that close to what he thought would move him to three under in California.\n\nBut he discovered that he did not hit the proper ball from the middle of the fairway. He hit the ball of his amateur playing partner which was only a few feet away. Add two strokes!\n\nSo Harman then hit his approach with his original ball from 122 yards to 14 feet and two putted for a dreaded double bogey. He thought he was staring at a 3, walked off with a 6.\n\nRule 6.3c(1) says, “the player gets the general penalty (two strokes) and must correct the mistake by continuing play with the original ball by playing it as it lies or taking relief under the rules.” The stroke made with the wrong ball and any more strokes before the mistake is corrected do not count.\n\nHarman was clearly bothered by the whole circumstance and it crept into the next hole, the par-5 11th where he made another double bogey after he hit his second shot into the water, dropped, failed to hit the green then did not get up and down. Ultimately he shot one-over 73 and well down near the bottom of the leaderboard.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS – Waldo Cortes-Acosta sees himself in prime position if he can get past Derrick Lewis.\n\nCortes-Acosta (16-2 MMA, 9-2 UFC) faces former title challenger Lewis (29-12 MMA, 20-10 UFC) in Saturday's UFC 324 (Paramount+) main card at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nCortes-Acosta, who fought five times in 2025, initially wanted to fight in December but wound up with a better deal in the promotion's debut card on Paramount.\n\n\"It's better, too, because it's my sixth fight in 11 months\" Cortes-Acosta told MMA Junkie and other reporters at Wednesday's UFC 324 media day. \"I didn't get a sixth fight in 2025, but I'm having a sixth fight in 11 months. This is amazing, too.\"\n\nThe Dominican fighter admits he grew up watching Lewis and is excited for the opportunity.\n\n\"I'm a person like, I'm training hard every time,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"For Derrick Lewis, when he started, I'd barely been training MMA. I followed him so much because he's a heavyweight, too, like me. He was one of my favorite fighters before until now, too, let me tell you. This Saturday, one day I was thinking, one day you will be fighting with him, and look at now. This is real, and next Saturday, Jan. 24, it will be happening. It's amazing for me.\"\n\nWith the heavyweight title picture currently unclear, that opportunity could lead to big things for Cortes-Acosta\n\n\"I want to fight at the White House,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"Latino America, everybody, we support it. More clout, so people can see one Latino fighting at the White House is amazing.\"\n\nUFC heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall is set to undergo double eye surgery after getting poked in the eye in his title fight against Ciryl Gane at UFC 321 this past October. No timeline for his return has been set, but Cortes-Acosta is ready to slide in if necessary.\n\n\"It's possible,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"I'd be available for the title shot or interim shot, interim title. Any fight the UFC can put on there, I'll be fighting, but I want to fight.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC 324: Waldo Cortes-Acosta wants White House title fight with win",

    "fullText": "There are just four NFL teams remaining in postseason play, with four former UNC football standouts scattered across those rosters. One Tar Heel in particular, though, is MVP contender Drake Maye.\n\nA quarterback who starred at North Carolina from 2021-2023, Maye is anchoring the New England Patriots' most successful season since Bill Belichick's head coaching days. Maye has his team in its first AFC Championship game since 2019, when New England won its most recent Super Bowl Title.\n\nOn Thursday, Maye earned some well-deserved recognition for his breakout campaign, earning one of the AP's five finalist nominations for NFL MVP.\n\nJoining Maye in this exclusive group are San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the last of whom is widely considered the MVP frontrunner.\n\nMaye has a golden chance to deliver his MVP-clinching moment on Sunday, with the Patriots traveling to face the Denver Broncos in a cold, 3 p.m. ET AFC Championship clash.\n\nOne step closer. 👟\n\nThe Real MVP. @DrakeMaye2 pic.twitter.com/AJSnZElrPm\n\n— Carolina Football (@UNCFootball) January 22, 2026\n\nBias aside, Maye makes an extremely strong case to win MVP in his \"Sophomore\" NFL season. Maye's 4,394 passing yards are fourth amongst quarterbacks in the regular season, his 31 passing touchdowns are third and his 77.1 QBR led the NFL.\n\nMaye also compiled 450 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns in regular season action, showcasing the same dual-threat ability he did as a Tar Heel.\n\nDespite five turnovers in the postseason, Maye is playing solid football in leading New England one win from the Super Bowl. Maye completed 33 of his first 56 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 76 rushing yards on 14 carries.\n\nIf Maye takes better care of the football on Sunday and his offensive line holds up, Maye will have no issue putting an exclamation point on his case for NFL MVP.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: Drake Maye tabbed a finalist for 2025 AP NFL MVP award",

The game, corresponding to the second round of the Liga BetPlay I-2026, cannot be played on the originally scheduled date because the event organizer did not meet the deadlines for delivering the Atanasio Girardot Stadium to INDER Medellín. This lack of administrative coordination has prevented the sports venue from being available for professional football according to the established calendar.\n\nThe governing body was emphatic in stating that this situation is completely beyond its control, regretting the serious impact on the tournament’s planning and the direct harm to the clubs involved. In order to mitigate the sporting impact, DIMAYOR has set April 6 as the new date for the match at the \"Coloso de la 74,\" with the final kickoff time yet to be confirmed.

    "description": "Get the best Lakers vs. Clippers predictions ahead of tonight's battle of L.A. at the Intuit Dome. Free NBA picks for January 22.",
    "fullText": "As we hit the halfway point in the NBA schedule, the Los Angeles Clippers finally seem to be salvaging their season, but that progress will be tested tonight when they host the Los Angeles Lakers at Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Battle of L.A. season series sits at 1-1 heading into this matchup, and my Lakers vs. Clippers predictions expect LeBron James to be one of the swing factors.\n\nLet's dive right into my NBA picks for Thursday, January 22.\n\nLakers vs Clippers best bet: LeBron James Over 12.5 rebounds + assists (-112 bet365)\n\nLeBron James' injury issues may point to a 41-year-old in his 23rd season, but his stat lines suggest he’s got something left in the tank. James has been able to keep his sciatica and arthritis at bay while starting 2026 with a bang, so look for his fingerprints to be all over tonight’s clash with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nWith Luka Doncic doing so much of the scoring for the Los Angeles Lakers, I’m targeting LeBron’s rebounds and assists here, and he’s gone past this combo O/U number in four of his past five outings.\n\nJames has been getting the job done in both these categories so far this month, with averages of 7.7 RPG and 7.6 APG in January, and he was closing in on a triple-double in L.A.’s win over the Denver Nuggets earlier this week.\n\nUntil Austin Reaves returns, LeBron is going to have a larger share of the playmaking, particularly when Luka is on the bench, and there’s just not a lot of secondary ball-handling in the current rotation. Equally, he’s got a big role to play alongside Deandre Ayton on the boards.\n\nAt this stage of his career, James can still do the little things that drive winning, and the Lakers will need all of that veteran savvy to hold off their cross-city rivals tonight.\n\nThe Lakers are 7-3 SU in their last 10 meetings with the Clippers, and an impressive 14-8 on the road this season. With Kawhi Leonard still listed as questionable, the burden on James Harden could once again be massive, and the hosts gave up 138 points to the Chicago Bulls this week.\n\nHarden continues to put up big numbers, and I’ll take the Over on his rebounds prop here. He’s grabbed 4+ boards in six of his last seven games, and the Clippers will gladly keep him closer to the rim if it avoids the Luka defensive assignment.\n\nIvica Zubac has had some miserable possessions trying to guard Doncic on switches in the past, but the Clippers will lean on him for big minutes here. Zubac has posted three straight double-doubles, and he’s finished with 11+ rebounds in his last four games.\n\nSpread: Lakers -1.5 (+100) | Clippers +1.5 (-120)\n\nMoneyline: Lakers -110 | Clippers -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 223.5 (-110) | Under 223.5 (-110)\n\nThe Lakers are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings between these teams.

    "description": "A look at 20 free agents who have played for a defense with Parker as a coach, and how each performed in 2025.",
    "fullText": "One of the oldest tenets in the NFL is that players tend to follow the coaches who have had positive impacts on their development. With Christian Parker in line to become the next Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator, and with his glowing reputation as a teacher and tactician, it is fair to wonder which former players could be joining him in Dallas.\n\nFans know, the club is in dire need of additional defensive talent. And while Parker is moving up to playcaller for the first time in his career, his relationships with players doesn't necessarily have to be limited to secondary players just because he was the defensive passing game coordinator. There could absolutely be linebackers who have been involved in those meetings who are interested in working for the 34-year old under the bright lights in Dallas.\n\nThe first glimpse is to who are pending free agents within the Philadelphia Eagles organization but things don't stop there. Parker also coached with the Denver Broncos from 2021 through 2023, and players from that era could still easily be able to contribute in 2026.\n\nUnfortunately for the Cowboys, the players who likely have most benefitted from Parker's tutelage are either still under their rookie deals with the Eagles, or have signed on long-term with their team.\n\nPatrick Surtain II: First-team All-Pro\nQuinyon Mitchell: First-team All-Pro\nCooper DeJean: First-team All-Pro\n\n... and all before Christian Parker turns 35. \n\nwelcome to the #Cowboys, sir. https://t.co/vmUEdicnZM\n\n— Patrik [No C] Walker (@VoiceOfTheStar) January 22, 2026\n\nHere's a rundown of the top potential free agents who could now be in the mix in Dallas, tiered by their 2025 Pro Football Focus overall defensive grades.\n\nCB Ja'Quan McMillian (RFA), Denver, 2022-23, 80.3 grade in 2025\n\nMcMillian is a former UDFA who has been a staple in the Denver secondary. They will most likely slap him with a 1st round or 2nd round tender, taking him off the market.\n\nSafety Avonte Maddox, Detroit, 2024, 79.1 grade in 2025\n\nMaddox had an incredible single season in Detroit, but didn't fare as well in Philly. He had a 61.9 overall grade in his one season working with Parker.\n\nSafety CJ Gardner-Johnson, Philadelphia, 2024, 51.4 grade in 2025\n\nNot a great year for Gardner-Johnson in Chicago, but he did have a 77.0 grade w/ Parker in 2024.\n\nLB Justin Strnad, Denver, 2021-23, 72.1 grade in 2025\n\nStrnad barely played while Parker was in Denver, but that doesn't mean they didn't have a chance to form some level of working relationship. Now that he's getting, he's an intriguing option for the Cowboys to fill out their linebacker core with.\n\nCB Fabian Moreau, Minnesota, 2023, 71.4\n\nMoreau has a strong grade, but only played 198 snaps in 2025 as a reserve. Could definitely be added as a depth piece to help round out the roster if Parker liked what he saw their one year together in 2023; Moreau graded out at 62.4 on 739 snaps.\n\nLB Alex Singleton, Denver, 2022-23, 70.1\n\nSingle had a strong first year in Denver with Parker in 2022, his highest graded of his six seasons at 79.1.\n\nSafety PJ Locke, Denver, 2021-23, 63.0\n\nNothing much stands out with Locke, who has mostly been a reserve, but he did have 3 sacks on 11 pash rush snaps in 2023 with Parker.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 62.2\n\nDean has generally been regarded as a bust with the Eagles, but when he got starter snaps through the year in 2024 with Parker, he had a 77.4 grade, including a strong year in both run defense and pass rush.\n\nThose aren't the only back-seven players who are on the free agent market this year, but they are the ones who turned in average-or-better performances. Here's a look at other free agent linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties with ties to Parker.\n\nCB Adoree' Jackson, Philadelphia, 2025, 53.6 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Marcus Epps, Philadelphia, 2025, 51.8 grade in 2025\n\nSafety Reed Blankenship, Philadelphia, 2024-25, 42.6 grade in 2025\n\nLB Ben Van Sumeren (RFA), Philadelphia, 2024-25, N/A\n\nLB Josey Jewell, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Justin Simmons, Out of League, 2021-23\n\nSafety Kareem Jackson, Out of the League, 2021-22\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Eagles, NFL free agents who may follow DC Christian Parker to Cowboys",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers will enter the offseason with a new offensive coordinator after Zac Robinson was hired.\n\nThe former Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator joins the Bucs, and the wealth of weapons Baker Mayfield has at his disposal.\n\nBut Baker might have one less, depending on how the offseason goes.\n\nMike Evans is a free agent, and we aren't sure if No. 13 will continue on or retire.\n\nFor ESPN's Bill Barnwell, money will be a big factor in how this plays out.\n\n\"The player Evans' camp will try to link the star wideout to is Davante Adams, who hit free agency after a frustrating age-32 season and landed a two-year, $44 million contract with the Rams, including $26 million guaranteed at signing,\" Barnwell writes. \"Would the Bucs agree to that sort of deal?\n\n\"Evans is a franchise legend, though, and the rules can be different when those types of players are involved. It would surprising if he played somewhere else in 2026.\"\n\nMore:Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield gives NFL perfect Week 1 setup with Stefanski's Falcons\n\nIs it worth it for the Buccaneers to give Evans Davante Adams-type money?

The reliever had a 2.95 ERA through 76.1 innings pitched, and struck out a total of 74 batters during his time at the top level.\n\nMore news: Dodgers Co-Owner Blasts Ruining Baseball Narrative\n\nThe southpaw’s ERA ranked second among Dodgers relievers with more than 20 appearances, only behind Edgardo Henriquez.\n\nDreyer has been recognized time and time again for his excellence in 2025, and had also been named as the best reliever to make his debut in 2025 by MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince.\n\nMore news: Dodgers’ Kyle Tucker Reveals Reason For New Jersey Number\n\n“Really, an impossible choice, because there are always young relievers with sick stuff who come up and dazzle from their debuts onward,” wrote Castrovince. “This season has no shortage. If we put in a limit of at least 40 innings pitched, then the Cardinals’ Matt Svanson, White Sox’s Mike Vasil, Blue Jays’ Braydon Fisher, Padres’ David Morgan, Marlins’ Cade Gibson, Rays’ Ian Seymour and Rockies’ Juan Mejia all have strong cases, with adjusted ERA+ marks well above the league average.\n\n“The 26-year-old Dreyer, though, is worthy of this particular brand of love because of the large workload (72 1/3 innings) and reliable relief work (1.05 WHIP, 2.86 ERA) he’s provided for a first-place Dodgers team that has a behemoth roster but has often been scrambling in the bullpen. Dreyer has a calmness that belies his inexperience.”\n\nMore news: What Dodgers Games Will Be on NBC Prime Time in 2026?\n\nDreyer’s dominance last season stretched into the postseason as well, with the left-hander making four appearances in the playoffs. He threw 0.2 scoreless innings against the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card round, then followed that up with a scoreless inning against the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS.\n\nHe made two more appearances in the World Series, and didn’t allow a run through either of them.\n\nDreyer is sure to play a big part in a Dodgers bullpen which struggled to produce towards the end of 2025, and he will hope to have a similarly solid season in 2026 as the Dodgers look to win their third consecutive World Series title.",

    "description": "Nottingham Forest's hopes of a top-eight finish in the Europa League - and a straight route to the last 16 - are hanging by a thread after a one costly minute leads to defeat by Sporting Braga.",
    "fullText": "It was hard to see how Thursday night could have gone much worse for Nottingham Forest.\n\nAs they fell to a dour defeat in Braga, they completed the unholy trinity of scoring an own goal, missing a penalty and receiving a red card.\n\nHaving begun the evening with hopes of pushing on for a top-eight finish in the Europa League - and securing automatic qualification for the last 16 - Sean Dyche's side head home with those hopes all-but dashed.\n\nEven victory over Ferencvaros in the final round of league phase games is unlikely to be enough to spare them a two-legged play-off to reach the last 16.\n\nWhile the result was bad, the fact the travelling supporters booed their side off at both half-time and full-time tells you the performance was just as poor.\n\nThe outcome at least could all have been so different had Morgan Gibbs-White managed to convert a 53rd-minute penalty.\n\nBut the midfielder's effort was saved - and 55 seconds later, Braga were in front through a Ryan Yates own goal.\n\n\"One minute of madness in a game that we never looked in trouble,\" Dyche told TNT Sports.\n\n\"We miss a penalty - that can happen. The reaction in the next minute or so... we lose the game to a poor goal.\n\n\"They get a lift and the crowd go mad, we knock off a bit, and an unfortunate situation for Yatesy. Very frustrated.\"\n\nThat Braga managed to win the match without having a single shot on target - becoming only the second team in Europa League history to do so - will only add to Forest's frustration.\n\nBut while Braga, who did hit the post at 1-0, might not have offered a huge amount going forward, Forest were little better for much of the game.\n\nForest slump to Braga defeat with Yates own goal\n\nDyche had made seven changes from Saturday's 0-0 Premier League draw against leaders Arsenal. The last time he altered the side so drastically was at Wrexham in the FA Cup.\n\nAfter exiting the competition that night, the Forest boss was highly critical of the players who had come into the team but he more forgiving on this occasion.\n\n\"There's effort there but the cutting edge... we want more of that,\" he added.\n\n\"We are in a weird situation where I have to protect certain players. We know the Premier League is massively important but we wanted to do well in this competition and we still do.\n\n\"It's a fine line, it's a juggling act. On one hand you want to protect some players and give everyone a chance.\"\n\nYates felt that Forest were slightly hard done by to lose and that the visitors \"controlled the most part of the game\".\n\n\"We are frustrated because I think we did enough to win the game,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\n\"We've missed an opportunity. Not that we were terrible but we can definitely do better. We have to move on quickly.\"\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott saw it slightly differently and highlighted the added blow of Elliot Anderson's late sending off.\n\n\"The perfect way to sum it up is a mess,\" he told TNT Sports. \"Collectively it wasn't good enough.\n\n\"To top it off and lose someone of the stature of Anderson when you have a massive game next week is devastating.\n\n\"You often look at games and wonder if there are any positives. I don't think there are any tonight.\n\n\"A terrible night, terrible performance on what should have been a marvellous evening.\"\n\nAnderson will miss next week's final group game and Forest will hope the ban is not extended to include the likely play-off in February.\n\nThose extra games could be a problem for Forest at such a busy stage of the season as they chase Premier League survival - and going into them without their star midfielder would stretch the squad even further.\n\nUltimately, Forest will feel it is a situation they could have avoided.\n\n\"You might come away with a draw, but you shouldn't really lose that game,\" Dyche said.\n\nBut in \"one minute of madness\", lose it they did.\n\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Nottingham Forest - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "The three biggest questions to be answered for the Lake Show in 2026.",
    "fullText": "15 days remain until the Lake Show make their arrival in 2026.\n\nAnd it’ll be a suspenseful 15 days.\n\nAfter falling narrowly short in a Hollywood-esque adventure to a national title, Northwestern women’s lacrosse finds itself in an extremely intriguing position. Kelly Amonte Hiller has done an overhaul in the transfer portal to shore up the attack in what seems to be a “win-now” situation for NU.\n\nWith four graduate students joining the program, it seems as though the ‘Cats are going for broke this coming season: national championship or bust.\n\nKey word: national. Not just a Big Ten title, or even a Final Four appearance.\n\nNorthwestern has positioned itself to take it all, and the ’Cats Express will surely be a fun ride to jump on when it takes off from Chestnut Hill in just two weeks time.\n\nAny subway system has its major stops along the way. Each train that a passenger boards has that one robust, active, always busy stop in the middle of the city.\n\nWhat makes the ‘Cats Express so different this year is that it has three major stops along its course — stops where passengers can get a glance at where the program’s future track lines may run, and, more importantly, where this team’s final destination might be.\n\nAnd like any subway system with those major stops, these three jump off the map to anyone who boards the train.\n\nStops so recognizable that one can spot them with their eyes shut.\n\nStop number one to mark on your maps is Chapel Hill, NC.\n\nJust a few months ago, the lacrosse world had been raving about Boston College having Northwestern’s number. After defeating the ‘Cats in the 2024 national championship, and dominating them in Evanston in the No. 1 vs. No. 2 season opener last year, the Eagles seemed to have cemented themselves as superior to their midwestern foes.\n\nThat seemed to ring true through three quarter of their Final Four matchup against NU, when BC led by five with only fifteen minutes to go.\n\nWe all know how that story ended, with the Cardiac ‘Cats snatching triumph from the deepest depths of treachery in an all-time finish.\n\nHowever, NU needed one more comeback effort in the title game in order to reach the mountaintop again.\n\nAnd who denied them that storybook ending?\n\nCarolina blue haunted the ‘Cats all spring last year. Not only did the Tar Heels delegate NU to the position of national runner-up for the second straight season, but they were the only program left unconquered by Northwestern in 2025.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, the Tewaaraton award ended up going home with UNC, despite Madison Taylor having one of the greatest offensive seasons in the history of the sport. Instead, Chloe Humphrey walked the stage.\n\nInside Lacrosse projects UNC at No. 1 and Northwestern at No. 2, and looking back at the history between the two teams, that projection seems quite accurate. March 25, however, serves the ‘Cats a golden opportunity to begin to rectify last year’s shortcomings with a win over their biggest adversaries amidst the ever-intimidating, always ruthless Tar Heel Nation.\n\nSimply put, NU’s quest for its second national title of the decade will need to find a pathway around the roadblock that North Carolina presents.\n\nWhat a surprise. Stop two: Ryan Fieldhouse, where the next leader of the program will make herself felt in 2026.\n\nWith Madison Taylor and Lucy Munro heading into their final years of Northwestern lacrosse, there’s a gargantuan void that’s soon to be left for coach Hiller to fill — a hole that’s threatening to jeopardize the ‘Cats esteemed position as one of the best teams in the nation.\n\nAditi Foster seems to be the frontrunner to take the reins for NU in the near future. Her 12 goals and five assists don’t appear enticing at first glance, but the Philadelphia native was stellar in moments where Northwestern needed a spark.\n\nFoster provided a goal to give the ‘Cats some much-needed cushion in their victory over No. 6 Syracuse, netted the game winner in the finals of the Big Ten Tournament vs. Maryland, and pulled NU within two in their comeback win against BC in Gillette Stadium.\n\nDespite the influx of transfers to shore up the attack, namely Madison Epke and Olivia Adamson, it’s probable that Foster will get her share of starts in the lineup this season.\n\nAnother important piece to keep an eye on will be Taylor Lapointe, who showed her versatility against Colorado and USC last season, displaying the ability to score, find teammates at the arc, and cause chaos defensively.\n\nAnother two attackers that’ll be in the mix are Claire Marosi and Claire Ratke, whose appearances have been scarce since arriving in Evanston, but will pick up steam as time progresses.\n\nDespite the losses to the program, pending season’s end, Northwestern remains with national contender potential with the talent on their roster. What’s of most importance to the ‘Cats is a player to step up and spearhead the program for the years ahead.\n\nStop three to highlight is one that NU lax is starting to build into its own “Times Square” of sorts: a robust location that’s guaranteed to draw a crowd.\n\nNorthwestern Medicine Field at Martin Stadium. The site for the NCAA Women’s Lacrosse Final Four this year, which could provide a thrilling end to one of the most storied college careers ever.\n\nMaddy Taylor has nearly done it all at Northwestern. She’s a national champion, an All-American, a Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, a Tewaaraton finalist and the NCAA record holder for most goals in a season.\n\nThe one blemish on her resume is as such: she’s never led the ‘Cats to the mountaintop.\n\nWhen Taylor and company won it all in 2023, that company included a “who’s who” of the NCAA’s best: Izzy Scane, Erin Coykendall and Hailey Rhatigan, just to name a few. Recognizing this is not to be confused as an attempt to discredit her role as a first-year: Taylor tied for the game-high in goals in that national title game against BC, which is only a snapshot of what she did. But it’s hard to deny that the support around her was astounding, and can be categorized as one of the deepest rosters of the past decade.\n\nFast forward to 2025, when that support is long gone and Taylor is now the focal point of the offense, dominating ranked opponent after ranked opponent and having her way offensively.\n\nUntil she reached the national championship.\n\nTaylor was completely erased from the Northwestern attack, held scoreless on a measly three shot attempts. When the lights were turned up to maximum brightness, the nation’s top scorer was nowhere to be found.\n\nHer senior year is one that can be characterized as her redemption arc: her opportunity to trek back to the biggest game of the year, only this time, to exhibit her dominance when it matters most.\n\nOne final chance to lead. One final chance to triumph. One final chance to cement her legacy as a Northwestern great, while doing so on the legendary lakefront, which has seen countless moments etched in the lore of Wildcat athletics forever.\n\nWith a national championship, Taylor can join that sacred lore as one of the best to ever touch a lacrosse stick.",

Prescott is joined by Stefon Diggs, Aidan Hutchinson, Trevor Lawrence, and Christian McCaffrey, and in this particular case each of the five players are coming back from injuries sustained during the 2024 season.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this that way because Comeback Player of the Year can sometimes be a fluky award in terms of the person that wins it. The name implies that the players are coming back from something and that is often assumed to be an injury. And while that is the case for this year’s finalists the past has seen some players win the award after “coming back” from simply having a down season that had no injury as a factor.\n\nPrescott won the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year Award a few years ago and also won Offensive Rookie of the Year after his first season in the league.

    "fullText": "Indiana's perfect season is built for the silver screen. The Hoosiers officially became the biggest long-shot national champions since at least 2001. They put the bow on their storybook run with a 27-21 win over Miami, the school their Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Fernando Mendoza, wanted to play for when he grew up a walk away from its campus.\n\nMendoza put his body on the line to score an epic fourth-quarter touchdown, and Indiana sealed its first football title with an interception that ended the Hurricanes' potential game-winning drive.\n\nIf a movie is made chronicling Indiana's turnaround from Big Ten laughingstock to college football royalty, it could be a box-office hit — that is, if the viewership numbers from Monday night's title game are any indication.\n\nBecause the thriller at Hard Rock Stadium drew 30.1 million viewers and was the second-most-watched College Football Playoff national championship game, according to ESPN PR.\n\nThe 2026 #NationalChampionship ft. @CanesFootball & @IndianaFootball delivered:\n\n📈 30.1M viewers, 33.2M peak\n🏈 2nd most-watched #CFBPlayoff title game\n📺 2nd best cable telecast ever\n🏆 Most-viewed non‑NFL sports event since '16 World Series Gm 7\n\n🔗 https://t.co/IFdlYlrxmc pic.twitter.com/rLM3Yt9iIp\n\n— ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) January 22, 2026\n\nThe CFP debuted during the 2014 season.

At the time, viewership numbers were down compared to the season prior when Michigan and Washington brought in approximately 25 million viewers.\n\nCollege football's biggest game delivered this time around, and not just due to Indiana's Hollywood script.

    "fullText": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery may not believe his team are Premier League title contenders - but he is \"dreaming\" of Europa League glory after reaching the last 16.\n\nVilla defeated Fenerbahce 1-0 in Turkey to ensure a top-eight league-phase finish with a game to spare.\n\nOn Sunday, the Spaniard warned Villa are \"not top-five contenders\" after they lost 1-0 at home to Everton.\n\nShould Villa finish outside the Premier League's top four - or top five if England is awarded an extra qualifying berth - their only hope of Champions League football next season will be through winning the Europa League.\n\nFormer Seville, Arsenal and Paris St-Germain boss Emery has won the Europa League a record four times as manager, last doing so with Villarreal in 2021, and was managing his 100th game in the competition on Thursday.\n\nHe told the media \"we have clear objectives in this competition to be a contender for a trophy\" after his side's victory in Istanbul.\n\n\"[We want] To be a contender in case we need this trophy to play in the Champions League. Through our league [it] is very difficult,\" he added.\n\n\"I am dreaming to be here getting trophies and the Europa is one objective we have this year.\"\n\nDespite being the seventh-most successful club in English football by trophies won, Villa's last piece of major silverware was the League Cup in 1996.\n\nSancho scores first Villa goal to seal last-16 spot\n\nWho can join Aston Villa in Europa League last 16?\n\nAston Villa are on a superb run of form.\n\nThey have won 20 of their past 25 matches (D1, L4) with only Arsenal (21) having won more among teams in Europe's big-five leagues during that period.\n\nTheir blip on Sunday against Everton meant they missed out on the chance to move second, within four points of Premier League leaders Arsenal - Emery's old club.\n\nHe made six changes against Fenerbahce and his side dominated, with the 1-0 scoreline flattering the 28-time Turkish champions.\n\nAfter the match Emery praised his players for \"respecting\" the competition, adding he was \"so, so happy\" with their response.\n\nVilla's match-winner Jadon Sancho scored his first goal for the club on his 19th appearance since joining on loan from Manchester United in September.\n\n\"It's nice to have a manager that backs you and obviously believes in you,\" said the 25-year-old forward who has not played for United since August 2024, and whose contract with them expires this summer.\n\n\"He [Emery] just keeps on telling me to be positive every time I play. Every opportunity I get I'm going to try and do 100% and hopefully I can deliver goals.\"\n\nSancho has only started two Premier League games this season, but in the Europa League he has been in Villa's starting line-up for each of their past five matches.\n\nVilla have played 12 times since the start of December, and by guaranteeing a top-eight league-phase finish avoided a two-legged play-off in February.\n\nEmery still played striker Ollie Watkins for the full 90 minutes on Thursday, and star midfielder Morgan Rogers for 74 minutes.\n\nHe was also able to give Tyrone Mings his first start since November, after the defender recovered from a thigh injury.\n\nAmadou Onana, who has been out with a hamstring issue, was also given a late cameo off the bench and is another key player returning.\n\n\"[We are] building the team with some circumstances not helping us,\" Emery told TNT Sports.\n\n\"But next week we can finish the transfer window and hopefully we can get everything we need to complete the squad for the next months and the competitions we have.\"\n\nLatest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Aston Villa - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Baltimore Ravens RB Derrick Henry shares his thoughts on New York Giants head coach John Harbaugh.",
    "fullText": "There is no tougher runner in the NFL right now than Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer is currently the NFL's leader in touchdowns (127) and rushing yards (13,018) among active players, and his highlight reel is filled with defenders bouncing off his invincible body.\n\nHenry began his career in Tennessee and moved to Baltimore two years ago to better his chances at a Super Bowl and played those two seasons under head coach John Harbaugh, who was fired last week by the Ravens after 18 seasons.\n\n“I love Coach. He’s a great leader,\" Henry told The Escapist in a recent interview. \"Enjoyed my time with him in Baltimore. Kind of sad that it ended while I came to Baltimore, but I wish Coach the best. I definitely appreciate everything that he’s taught us and taught me through these last two years of me being a new guy.”\n\nHarbaugh has naturally moved on to the New York Giants to become their new head coach.\n\nHenry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner and five-time Pro Bowler, was asked how Harbaugh treats his players. His answer should delight the Giants and their fans.\n\n“He’s had a great philosophy about how he ran the organization and how he treated the players,\" Henry said. \"After we won, he would point out every single player that had an impact on the game. Even if it doesn’t get noticed nationally, he made sure that they’re appreciated throughout the organization for the effort that they put into the team.”\n\nBut, more importantly, Harbaugh will bring structure and discipline back to the Giants. After 10 double-digit losing seasons over the past 12 years, the Giants and their fans are finally getting a coach deserving of the title.\n\n\"As we begin a new chapter in New York, our focus is simple,\" Harbaugh said in his introductory press conference with th Giants this week, \"it starts with building a team that is physical and tough, that's capable of overwhelming their opponent from beginning to end, and especially at the end, that understands how to finish, that is smart and disciplined, that plays the game the way it should be played, and that everybody watching it, including those playing it, would be proud of.\n\n\"We're going to work together. We have great and talented people to accomplish a shared mission. There will be a relentless commitment to this organization, to this city and the fans to do things the right way every single day. Nothing will be taken for granted. It will always, always be all about the team. The team, the team, the team. Thanks, Dad, for that. It'll always be about that. Now it's time to go to work.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Derrick Henry: New York Giants' John Harbaugh 'a great leader'",

    "fullText": "In the UK, 98% of two-year-olds watch screens on a typical day, on average for more than two hours – and almost 40% of three- to five-year-olds use social media. Could this lead to alarming outcomes?\n\nAt Stoke primary school in Coventry, there are many four-year-olds among those starting in reception class who can’t sit still, hold a pencil or speak more than a four-word sentence. Lucy Fox, the assistant headteacher and head of foundations, is in no doubt what is causing this: their early exposure to screens, and a lot of it. When the children experiment with materials and creativity, and make things in the classroom, she says, “We notice a lot of children will cut pieces of cardboard out and make a mobile phone or tablet, or an Xbox controller. That’s what they know.”\n\nAt another school in Hampshire, a longtime reception teacher says in the last few years she has noticed children getting frustrated if activities aren’t instant and seamless – something she thinks comes from playing games on a phone or tablet. There is a lack of creativity and problem-solving skills, noticeable when the children are playing with Lego or doing jigsaw puzzles and turning the pieces to fit. “I find their hand-eye coordination isn’t very good, and they find puzzles difficult. Doing a puzzle on an iPad, you just need to hold and move it on the screen. They get really frustrated and I feel like there are certain connections the brain is not making any more.”\n\nThere is also something of an attitude shift, she says – a kind of individualism that she’s convinced comes from playing alone on a device. “We are having to model to children how to be with others, how you work as a team, how you share things, because they’re so used to having their own time, doing their own thing. We’re losing a big part of being human, and if these young children don’t get all those skills, they’re not going to pick them up later on.”\n\nEarlier this month, the government announced it would be issuing new guidance on screen use for under-fives in April, after a report it commissioned found 98% of two-year-olds were watching screens on a typical day, with the average duration more than two hours. Those who spent the most time – around five hours – had limited vocabulary compared with those who spent the least, and were twice as likely to show signs of emotional and behavioural difficulties.\n\n“It’s a trend that we’ve been seeing for quite a long time,” says Pasco Fearon, a professor of developmental psychopathology at University College London and the director of the Children of the 2020s study. “Look at studies getting all the way back to the turn of the century – you can see that screen time, on the whole, has been increasing.” That’s true for all of us, not just for children. Of the impact on children, Fearon says: “I’m sure it’s a factor that a lot of parents, like the rest of us, are on their phones. It’s becoming very dominant in everyone’s lives.” The data in this study, he says, “can be quite a useful focal point to start thinking: Wait, is this what we want? A little bit of a reset might be useful for everyone.”\n\nThis report comes on the back of other recent research showing very young children’s screen access is increasing. In October, the American research organisation Pew found that 38% of parents of under-twos said their child uses or interacts with a smartphone, and 8% of under-fives had their own smartphone. In the UK, Ofcom’s research has found that 19% of children aged three to five had their own mobile phone in 2024, and that 37% of children this age – more than 800,000 kids – were using at least one social media app, up from 29% in 2023 (though the majority use it with their parents’ supervision).\n\nThe Conservatives have just pledged to follow Australia and ban social media for under-16s, and the Labour government has said it will consider doing the same. (Australia’s ban, incidentally, includes YouTube but not YouTube Kids, which is aimed at younger viewers – so it does not necessarily address the problem of excess screen time.)\n\nUnlike for teenagers, little research has been done on the impact of social media on the youngest children. At the extreme end, all children are at risk of sexual abuse online. In November last year, the NSPCC reported online grooming crimes had reached record highs, with the youngest victim being just four.\n\nMore is becoming known about the impact of young children exposed to excessive screen time, though. In 2025, a New Zealand study found that young children who had watched more than 90 minutes a day had below-average vocabulary, communication and numeracy at the ages of four and eight, and that more screen time meant even poorer outcomes.\n\nToday Kindred Squared, an organisation that campaigns for early years education and development, releases its latest report on children’s school readiness. It found that more than half of teachers believed spending too much time on screens – by children and their parents alike – was the single biggest factor contributing to the child not being ready to start school. “We know that screen time is a problem,” says the CEO, Felicity Gillespie. This year, reception teachers reported 28% of children were unable to use a book correctly, for instance tapping or swiping the pages as if it were an electronic device.\n\n“In cases of higher usage,” says Gillespie, “there is a real negative impact on language acquisition. It’s not that surprising when you think about how language is developed in babies, that it is through that serve-and-return interaction with adults – the baby makes a noise, the parent makes a noise back. The baby smiles, the parent smiles. It’s that two-way interaction that fires the baby’s brain. Nought to two is the period when our brains are growing at their fastest rate, so the earlier you put babies in front of screens, the more they are missing out [on] those early interactions, which is where the hard-wiring of the brain is happening.”\n\nThe early years, says Gillespie, “are the foundation for everything that follows, for mental and physical health, wellbeing, your happiness, your success in relationships. I think it comes back to this need for better information for parents and clear, simple, unequivocal guidance. Tell them the truth. Tell them what the evidence says.”\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends children under two should get no screen time at all, and for those aged two to four, a maximum of one hour. Is that realistic in today’s parenting world? Gillespie acknowledges the latest study showing two-year-olds are watching two hours a day. “Then what we then need to do is give parents the information about why the WHO advises that, to inform people about the preciousness of these early years and the importance of brain development.” The government, she hopes, will “give parents the kind of practical, real-world guidance that takes account of the fact that, I think, we’ve probably missed the boat on the WHO guidance”.\n\nThe Covid pandemic accelerated screen use (many children in current reception classes and year 1 were born in that first year), but it had been steadily rising before that. “My referrals have been increasing over the past 10 years,” says Sandy Chappell, an early years speech and language therapist. During the lockdowns, she says, it was “not just that children were isolated from other children, but also that parents were relying more on screens to pacify young children. I had many parents in impossible situations, where they were trying to work from home and had babies and toddlers to entertain at the same time, so they had no choice but to rely on screens.”\n\nShe has sympathy for parents who rely on screens now. “Absolutely. It’s unbelievably difficult.” Fearon too, talking about the research that is driving the government’s advice, stresses it’s not about blaming parents. The study found children from disadvantaged families were more likely to spend time on screens. “This is about understanding the context in which this is happening, and how people are making the day work when there are challenges families are experiencing, financially, and in terms of work and all the pressures of daily life. If we’re trying to support families, it’s partly about giving them really clear advice, but also about giving more help to families, particularly those who are experiencing economic disadvantage. That’s going to give them a bit more slack to be able to play more, talk to their children more, be more engaged in the way that they’d like to.”\n\nIn Chappell’s clinic, she is seeing children with “poor attention and listening skills, poor turn-taking and social skills, as well as poor vocabulary and expressive language”. Many have their own electronic devices, and although Chappell has seen the stats about social media use, it’s not something she’s aware of. “Parents don’t tend to tell me that’s what’s happening, because I think instinctively they know it’s not a good thing.” And while some content is better than others – “things like [the BBC’s] CBeebies, where [many programmes are developed with] educational value by psychologists and educationists” – what matters more is duration. “We really need to cut the time down,” says Chappell.\n\nShe can spot the children who have spent a lot of time on screens: she has seen preschoolers, she says, who will spend seven or eight hours a day on a screen. Other children might be shy to begin with, but will soon start talking to her or will go straight to investigate her toy collection. Those who have spent a lot of time on screens, she says, don’t tend to interact with her and “don’t seem to be particularly interested in toys. They can’t follow simple instructions. They’re wandering around the room – and I’m not talking about young toddlers here, but three- and four-year-olds. They start school without even the basic skills that they need in order to be able to learn.”\n\nThis is often when the child is referred to her, with parents worrying they’re not ready for school. “Preschool children can catch up to a certain extent if the screens are reduced to a bare minimum and time is spent on building other skills. It becomes more difficult once they get to school, and we are finding that these issues are following children right through school. Their language levels at age four are one of the biggest predictors of their later academic achievement at GCSE level and beyond. So it really is important that we put the work in with children way before they go to school.”\n\nTo accommodate 60 reception children, but without space within the school, Stoke Primary turned a wooden “roundhouse” (a simple octagonal wooden structure), which had been in their forest school area, into a new classroom, complete with rugs, fairy lights and, inadvertently, no wifi – and therefore no screens. At first, as Fox wrote in TES (formerly the Times Educational Supplement), this seemed an “inconvenience” and a “hurdle”. It ended up transforming her thinking on screens in schools; her previous job had been in a school which prided itself on giving each child an iPad.\n\n“Very quickly we realised the impact that it was having on the children,” says Fox now. By the end of that first autumn term, 72% of the “roundhouse” children were considered to be “on track” compared with 44% of the children in the traditional classroom. When they switched the classes later in the year, they got similar results.\n\nThe roundhouse style, in which children sit in a circle, “forces communication and language to come before anything, which is so important. We have quite a significant amount of English as an additional language compared with other schools – 60% of our children in reception last year – so the language skills that it’s pulling out of them is remarkable.” Instead of the usual schemes, or structured lesson plans that use PowerPoint and other software, “there is none of that in the roundhouse. It forces you to go back to basics. I had to build up the confidence of those teachers to feel they could do that, and could make their own decisions about what they knew was best for their children. We all know that we live in a digital age, and there is no stopping digital growth. But to what extent are we using tech to replace the things that we know are best for our children?” Both reception classes no longer use screens for teaching, though the older classes do.\n\nFox is turning her attention to the newest generation of teachers coming through. “They’re from a different generation,” she says – people who have grown up with screens themselves. “How can we give them the confidence to know what’s best, and to put the scheme down and just connect with their children?”",

    "description": "This blog post explores the historical accuracy of medieval city-builder video games.",
    "fullText": "May 01, 2020 \n\n • \n Socio-Economic History\n and Medievalism\n\n • \n\nThis blog post explores the historical accuracy of medieval city-builder video games.\n\nSince many of us are working from home in these trying times, it seems safe to assume that more people than ever are indulging in playing the occasional computer game. A city builder is a specific kind of computer game in which you design a city, extract resources, set up production chains and ensure that your settlement grows. City builders are very similar to strategy games as they reward patience and strategy. In this article, I will take a look at one sub-genre of the city builder, the medieval city builder, and explain how this gaming genre relates to our knowledge of medieval settlement planning.\n\nThe city builder has its origins far back in the 1990s in the combination of the strategy genre and the management genre, leading to games such as Sim City (1989), Caesar (1992) and Age of Empires (1997).\n\nIt did not take long before medieval-themed city builders popped up. We may think of Settlers (1993) and Knights and Merchants (1998). In addition, the Anno games (1998-2019), although initially set in the 1600s basically had a medieval theme.\n\nThese games often start with plopping down a village center on a promising location near abundant resources. You then continue to gather these resources which grant you building materials for building new homes and facilities for your settlement.\n\nSetting up specialized production chains might involve growing grain, milling the grain for flour and turning the flour into bread which feeds your villages. Similarly, another production chain might involve rearing sheep for their wool, turning the wool into cloth and turning the cloth into clothing. When done correctly, the reward of correct investments and planning is that you see your settlement grow.\n\nThis often leads to settlements growing organically from a couple of houses around a community center to a larger settlement with hundreds of people. However logical such an organic growth of a settlement might seem, it is not historically accurate.\n\nAny gameplay loop that tells a story of linear settlement growth is incongruent with how a medieval economy worked (see Foussier 2004). Medieval villagers were often living on the edge of subsistence. Agricultural surpluses were skimmed by the church and the feudal lords. Bad harvests, banditry, warfare and disease might decimate a village community at any time. For this very reason, the demography of many European villages remained relatively stable between the twelfth and the eighteenth century. It may therefore be clear that the gameplay loop of city builders pivots around the concept of doing the historically exceptional (i.e. growing a settlement to a town) and thereby strays far from what actually happened in the lives of our medieval forebears. \n\nA notable exception to this genre trope is the game Banished (2014) in which high mortality rates and bad weather do seriously stifle any kind of linear growth. In this city builder you are constantly fighting the odds and settlement growth is not guaranteed. However, also in Banished it is your goal to overcome the stagnation and lead your settlement to expansion.\n\nA thing that is rarely touched upon in medieval city builders is how complex village life actually was. This can be exemplified by how the community related to its overlords. Land ownership here is key. Land in the community might be owned by a lord, a local liegeman, a monastery or even directly by the duke or count. Taxes, rents and tithes were the organisational structures in which the landowner was tied to the farmers who worked the fields. Often the payment of taxes and tithes was linked to feast days and the visit of the tax collector represented a big event in the agricultural year. An interesting side note is that some obligations which the commoners had to the lord and the church (such as seigneurial duties like working a mill) might drain the community from the needed manpower for tilling the land. Furthermore, a rural community that was its own seigneury had access to a law court with sheriff, aldermen and a local militia (Middle Dutch schutterie) to fight off bandits with. Harsh capital punishments were set in place to deter anyone from raiding the farms and hamlets and the village gallows were often the first thing one saw when approaching a medieval settlement.\n\nBut something that is much more fundamental to the theme of a settlement building game, is how medieval settlements were actually planned and grew. Landscape historians and archaeologists have acquired a lot of insight into how this worked.\n\nLet's start with the realization that medieval settlements in their first stages of development were planned and laid out according to a specific design. In my own research into the settlement history of West-Brabant (southern Netherlands, from 1000 to 1300 CE) I have encountered the following types.\n\nHere is a sketch of a Brabantine circular manor (Middle Dutch vroonhoeve). This is a reinforced circular homestead with moat, often next to a bend in the river, containing several farms and a fan-like plot pattern radiating out from it. Such manors were often called BORCH.\n\nHere is a sketch of a Brabantine street settlement, often built with exploitation of nearby fenland in mind. It consists of a line of farms with associated evenly sized rectangular plots built in a line perpendicular to a raised road.\n\nHere is a more complex exploitation village which is set up with a moated enclosed church homestead and a central meadow as its center. There is a line of farms next to the road. The arable land to the east is bordered by a ditch supplying fresh drinking water (Middle Dutch bansloot). In layout, this type represents a hybrid between the two earlier settlement types.\n\nLet us first make clear that these different types of exploitation settlements often existed alongside each other and can be found in one and the same region. In part, the different types reflect different chronological layers but some types were also more suited to certain geographical environments than others.\n\nSo how were these settlements planned? Many medieval exploitation enterprises were initiated by a monastery or a consortium of free men who were granted permission by (or bought permission from) the feudal lord to “colonize” the wilderness.\n\nClearing the wooded landscape in order to create arable land was done by cutting away the trees and bushes (Middle Dutch rode) or, alternatively, burning it away in controlled fires (Middle Dutch brant).\n\nLand surveyors sent by the lord would then measure out the block or strips that would be taken in cultivation. Strips of arable land were often 1250m deep (6 Middle Dutch voorlingen = furlongs) so that the plough could go straight in a long line before having to turn. Important blocks or strips were demarcated by hedges, earthwork, woodwork, ditches or roads. Medieval names for these blocks often survived into the modern day.\n\nThe presence of drinking water (a river or a brook) in the vicinity was an important factor in choosing the location for the settlement. The vicinity of water entailed risk and reward because flooding was an ever present danger. Floods could devastate arable land but might also fertilize it. Meadows in particular were often situated in flood areas.\n\nSo how was such a settlement managed? First of all, the quality of the soil had to be carefully controlled by crop rotation: specific crops were sown on different segments of the arable land with one part laying fallow to recover from the tilling (English three-field system, Dutch drieslagstelsel). The cattle and sheep were put out to pasture on the common meadows guarded by a shepherd or cowherd. Pigs were allowed to forage in the nearby forests and killed in autumn before the winter starvation set in.\n\nRoads and rivers were important for transport of crops and livestock. These roads, some of them paved, some of them not, needed to be maintained. They were essential to the payment of the tithe, since tithe collectors assessed the harvest on the field and later collected the sheaves on the side of the road.\n\nThe buildings within the community also needed maintenance. Farmhouses, community barns and stables were made of wood and had to be rebuilt every few generations, only the name of the farm or homestead being continued.\n\nSo what kind of threats did a medieval settlement face? First of all, the weather was an important factor which dictated the success of the harvest. Storms, droughts and floods could devastate the harvest and decimate the community.\n\nDiseases and epidemics were another danger threatening the community. The situation on the countryside was a lot better in this regard than in the medieval towns, but an epidemic could still mean the end of a village. Similarly, diseases among livestock impacted the medieval subsistence economy in a brutal way.\n\nThen there are the consequences of medieval warfare affecting the community: Armies that passed by could plunder the village, burn the farms and execute villagers at will. Or they could also demand supplies, food and provisions as an emergency \"tax\"\n\nBut war also brought indirect consequences; a liege lord calling the banners and levying troops from the village community might extract a large part of the adult men. Warfare also disrupted the trade networks that supplied a village with building materials and commodities.\n\nThen there were internal threats to the fabric of the village community. We may think of social unrest because of land disputes. Feuds could also tear a community apart with endemic vendetta’s causing death and despair. A socially unstable society was also more prone to internal accusations of heresy and witchcraft.\n\nSo, which of the above listed features could potentially contribute to a more historically accurate computer game about medieval settlement building? First of all, it would be more realistic if the settlement could first be planned out and was not forced to \"grow organically\" from a community center. The first settlement phase would be a test of how “successful” a layout is in adapting to the exigencies of the terrain and the needs of the community. Only after that initial layout proved successful, further expansions can be planned.\n\nSecondly, it would be more realistic if we could build both straight roads and curved roads, just as in Cities Skylines (2015), a modern city builder well known for its incredibly flexible layout tools. Incidentally, the tools of Cities Skylines can also be used to recreate medieval settlements, as was done by YouTube creator Play Curiously who constructed an impression of a medieval Croatian village.\n\nSuch a flexible road drawing tool can then also be used to lay out ditches, hedges and enclosures since these features were central to the medieval experience of the cultivated landscape.\n\nThirdly, It would be interesting to see a medieval-themed game embrace the concept of flood valleys that limit and endanger pasture and arable land. Other historical city builders such as Pharaoh (1999) and Children of the Nile (2004) already implemented this feature for their setting in Ancient Egypt. However, such a mechanic would likewise fit a medieval city builder and show the general public how medieval society dealt with seasonal flooding as well as the devastating effects that storm floods could have.\n\nAnd finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.\n\nThere are some good reasons why city building games are not that historically accurate and instead adhere to the established formula of the city building game.\n\nFirst of all, a linear growth model makes sense from a gameplay perspective, since it is rewarding to see your settlement grow.in a linear way. It fosters a feeling of progress and motivates the player to keep momentum and push through to the next expansion phase. Secondly, games are generally wary of punishing failure too harshly in order to avoid demoralizing the player. Thirdly, in order to facilitate path finding for the simulated villagers it is easier to implement a gridlike road and building system rather than an off-grid building system that allows for curvy roads. So far only Cities Skylines has managed to do this in a satisfactory way.\n\nLastly, for marketing purposes and recognizability, game developers generally don't stray too far from the image of the Middle Ages that the public is already acquainted with. For a medieval city builder this means windmills, industrious peasants, lots of sheep and stone castles. Things like land surveying, crop rotation and tithe collection do not fit this image and challenge the romanticized picture of the uneducated farmer in his pre-industrial environment.\n\nAlthough I think medieval-themed city building games could benefit from incorporating some of the things we know about medieval settlement history into the gameplay loop, it may not be desirable for game developers to stray too far from the established formula. The idea that medieval settlements developed organically according to messy road plans is strongly imbedded in popular perception. Allowing both straight and curved road building in medieval city builders, may serve to challenge some of the stereotypes that exist about medieval village life. And if you ask me, that would be a good thing for it is an enriching experience to see the world through the eyes of our medieval forebears. One may find out that their lives were not that different after all...",

    "fullText": "Chainguard OS exists for one reason: to give our customers the world’s most trusted, secure, customer-centric foundation for the modern software supply chain.\n\nToday, hundreds of organizations run Chainguard OS in production. It’s become one of the most trusted pieces of infrastructure in our customers’ ecosystems, and part of a solution that delivers stability and security at scale. Their businesses and missions depend on Chainguard OS, and we want to ensure that Chainguard OS users are the ones shaping its future. That’s why we’re announcing a customer-led steering committee for Chainguard OS and recruiting members starting today.\n\nThe Chainguard OS Fully User Directed Committee, or the Chainguard OS FUD Committee, will ensure Chainguard OS evolves with our customers’ needs at the forefront, rather than focusing on the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that’s often manufactured around purpose-built Linux distros. Behind the tongue-in-cheek name, there’s a serious commitment: the FUD Committee ensures that Chainguard OS will remain customer-governed, with every decision aligned with the long-term interests of its users.\n\nThe committee will include customer organizations of all sizes, industries, and geographies, with members from both engineering and security teams. Chainguard’s R&D teams will work closely with committee members to drive specific outcomes, including:\n\nContinuing to align our secure-by-default philosophy with the operational realities of high-scale production environments;\n\nHelping to define tomorrow’s standards and technical foundations to keep delivering trusted open source across use cases; and\n\nServing as an advisory and oversight layer that represents the diverse voices of the community that Chainguard OS serves\n\nThe FUD Committee’s mission is to ensure Chainguard OS remains the world’s most trusted, secure, customer-centric foundation for the modern software supply chain. Committee members will serve as the voice of the user to help Chainguard make technical and roadmap decisions informed by real-world enterprise requirements and needs. Key responsibilities for members will include:\n\nTechnical decision-making: Influencing the technical direction of Chainguard OS, advising and deciding on key technical paths to maintain flexibility and ecosystem compatibility. For example, this could include deciding whether Chainguard OS should continue to use the upstream APK client rather than forking to add additional functionality.\n\nRoadmap alignment: Aligning on upcoming features, architecture shifts, and package support.\n\nStrategic feedback: Providing early input on breaking changes, new security primitives, and distro-level optimizations.\n\nEcosystem advocacy: Identifying emerging technologies or language ecosystems that should be prioritized for Chainguard OS support.\n\nTogether, this structure gives customers real influence, fewer surprises, and an OS that evolves intentionally. The result is a more stable, predictable, and trusted OS, guided by the users who rely on it every day.\n\nChainguard OS isn’t just infrastructure; it’s a commitment. Like any commitment that matters, it works best when it’s shared. The FUD Committee is how we make that partnership real by keeping users in the loop, making decisions in the open, and building trust into the process from the start.\n\nChainguard is recruiting members to serve on the FUD Committee. Get in touch if you’re interested in participating.\n\nIntroducing “How We Lead”: Chainguard’s approach to developing the best managers\n\nGary Knox, Director of Culture and Belonging\n\nAnchore Enterprise now validates Chainguard Libraries: prevent 98% of Python malware and eliminate high-severity CVE toil\n\nChainguard Joins IBM PDE Factory to Advance Trusted Open Source Software for Public Sector Missions\n\nTom White, Senior Director, Public Sector Partnerships\n\nChainguard + Booz Allen: Delivering Trusted Open-Source Software to U.S. Government Agencies\n\nTom White, Senior Director, Public Sector Partners\n\nChainguard Named on the Cloud 100 and a Best Workplace in 2025\n\nLiz Egan, Chief Marketing Officer\n\nThe Chainguard Slack Community is Here!",

    "description": "Three robotics experts said humanoid robots need to move beyond flashy demos to performing tasks that are actually useful in the real world at scale.",
    "fullText": "Humanoid robots can do kung-fu and parkour. But can they make your morning coffee?\n\nAt a Davos panel on Thursday, moderated by Business Insider's Jamie Heller, three robotics experts said humanoid robots needed to move beyond flashy demos and perform useful tasks in the real world at scale.\n\nJake Loosararian, the CEO of infrastructure startup Gecko Robotics, said that deploying robots into real-world environments was the major challenge facing the much-hyped industry.\n\n\"Deployment is the big problem right now for robotics, in terms of the ability for it to begin to make really large impacts, and for there to be a clear road map,\" said Loosararian.\n\nThe cofounder of the Pittsburgh-based company said that building reliable sources of data about the environments in which humanoid robots were operating would be critical for startups looking to move beyond flashy demos to real-world returns.\n\n\"You have to forward deploy and build your robots as close to the environment as possible. And that gives you the information and dataset that doesn't exist anywhere on the internet, anywhere on YouTube, about what these environments are like,\" Loosararian added.\n\nDaniela Rus, the director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said there was a gap between robots' ability to perform tasks in a laboratory and their ability to take on jobs traditionally done by humans in the real world.\n\n\"I can give you a robot that will fold your laundry and load your dishwasher, but it might cost you half a billion dollars,\" she said.\n\nRus said bridging that gap would require advancements in a humanoid robot's ability to perceive and manipulate the world through improved sensors and new AI models that can handle situations the robot may not have encountered before.\n\nShao Tianlan, the CEO of Chinese AI and robotics firm Mech-Mind, said that one big barrier to making humanoid robots useful in a factory environment was developing the capacity for them to learn directly from their human coworkers.\n\n\"If we want to deploy a robot, I would say demonstration is the most intuitive way to tell robots what to do. That's exactly how we humans teach others,\" he said.\n\nTianlan, who said that Mech-Mind had delivered more than 10,000 \"intelligent robots\" over the last 12 months, added that he did not believe humanoid robots needed \"Einstein-level\" intelligence to perform useful tasks, however.\n\nHe predicted that robots would take on some jobs performed by humans in controlled environments, such as in logistics and some service industries, in the next \"few hundred days.\"\n\nHumanoid robots are riding a wave of hype as companies like Tesla and Figure prepare to begin large-scale manufacturing of their machines. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made bold predictions about the company's Optimus robot, saying it could eliminate poverty and be the biggest product of all time.\n\nHowever, most humanoid robots have not yet been deployed in real-world environments. Many humanoid robot demos are staged in tightly controlled settings, and some use teleoperation, where human operators pilot the robots remotely.\n\nLoosararian called teleoperation the \"dirty little secret\" of robotics, adding that robotics companies had a responsibility to inform customers about whether their humanoid robots are operating autonomously or with human assistance.\n\n\"There's a lot of autonomy for certain tasks, but for the majority of the cases, for humanoids, it's learning in the environment, and it has to do that with teleoperation,\" Loosararian said.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to the stage at Davos in his first-ever World Economic Forum appearance, in which he revealed few new details.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk once called Davos \"boring af.\" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him.\n\nThe billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.\n\nMusk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning.\n\nInterviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of \"abundance for all,\" largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews.\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that \"ubiquitous\" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that \"AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively\" by 2030 or 2031.\n\n\"At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year.\n\nMusk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

    "title": "TikTok Strikes Deal for New U.S. Entity, Ending Long Legal Saga",
    "description": "The Chinese parent company for the popular video app said it had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new American TikTok to avoid a ban in the United States.",
    "fullText": "TikTok said on Thursday that its Chinese owner, ByteDance, had struck a deal with a group of non-Chinese investors to create a new U.S. TikTok, concluding a six-year legal saga that saw the app banned by Congress, ensnared in politicking between global superpowers and forced into a 14-hour blackout in the United States.\n\nInvestors including the software giant Oracle; MGX, an Emirati investment firm; and Silver Lake, another investment firm will own more than 80 percent of the new venture. That list also includes the personal investment entity for Michael Dell, the tech billionaire behind Dell Technologies, and other firms, TikTok said. Adam Presser, TikTok’s former operations head, will be the chief executive for the U.S. TikTok.\n\nThe deal is intended to loosen TikTok’s ties to China and address national security concerns that Beijing could use the app to surveil or manipulate its more than 200 million users in the United States.The changes enable “our U.S. users to continue to discover, create, and thrive as part of TikTok’s vibrant global community and experience,” said Shou Chew, TikTok’s chief executive, in an internal memo that called the move “great news.”\n\nThe agreement, which was hammered out over more than a year, resolves existential questions about TikTok’s future. The app — with its unceasing feed of lip syncs, political endorsements, conspiracy theories and skin care tutorials — would have had to leave the American market if it did not separate from ByteDance.\n\nIt was also the end of a legal odyssey. Since 2019, universities, several branches of the U.S. military, the vast majority of the House of Representatives and both President Trump and President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have tried to ban or block TikTok, with unanimous support from the Supreme Court. Influencers, mobilized by the app, lobbied politicians and mounted protests to save their feeds and follower counts. TikTok became embroiled in a trade war between the United States and China, as the nations engaged in a heated contest over technology and industrial supremacy.\n\nBut the drama dragged on for so long and with so little consequence that even some who once fought to save the app had stopped worrying about it.\n\nNaomi Hearts, a 28-year-old content creator in Los Angeles who twice traveled to Washington as part of TikTok’s lobbying efforts, said she felt “detached” from the platform after years of upheaval.\n\n“I feel like it’s going to be another day,” Ms. Hearts said in an interview this week, anticipating the deal’s completion.\n\nIt was unclear how much, if anything, the deal would change for TikTok’s users in the United States. Since the outlines of the deal were released months ago, users have raised concerns about whether the new owners will overhaul the algorithm that personalizes their feeds. And experts have cautioned that the arrangement might fail to address the national security concerns that motivated the deal in the first place.\n\nThe driving force behind the deal is a federal law, passed in 2024 and upheld by the Supreme Court, that would have banned the app if it did not separate itself from ByteDance by early 2025. The app even went dark for 14 hours as the law’s deadline approached, sending some users into a tailspin. But Mr. Trump formally delayed the enforcement of the law several times after he took office again, as he pushed the company to reach a deal for new ownership.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, Oracle, MGX and Silver Lake will each own 15 percent of TikTok’s U.S. operations. ByteDance will own just under 20 percent.\n\nThe other investors include Mr. Dell’s office and a long list of investment firms, including affiliates of General Atlantic and Susquehanna, both of which had previously invested in ByteDance.\n\nThe majority of the seven-member board for the new U.S. TikTok will be American, according to a December memo to TikTok employees. Mr. Chew has a seat on the board.\n\nThe new venture will moderate content in TikTok’s feed, deciding which posts to leave up and which to take down. It’s unclear what the value of the American version of TikTok will be. Vice President JD Vance said in September that a U.S. TikTok company would be valued at $14 billion. ByteDance, by contrast, has been valued at $480 billion in the private markets.\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order in September that gave formal approval to the arrangement, a move required under the 2024 law.\n\nThe Chinese government has not publicly commented on TikTok’s announcement. For years, Beijing had been a major obstacle to finalizing a deal. When the United States first pushed to force a sale of TikTok, China amended its export control list to include technologies like algorithms and source codes, giving it the power to weigh in on any deal involving the app.\n\nLast year, Trump officials said they had won Beijing’s support for a deal. China’s statements were more vague.\n\nSeveral of the new investors have ties to Mr. Trump, raising concerns for some TikTok users that the app could start showing more content aligned with the president’s views or the positions of the U.S. government.\n\nLarry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire founder, has a close relationship with Mr. Trump, and lobbied the president directly on behalf of his son David Ellison’s bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. MGX has done business with the Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.\n\nAnupam Chander, a law and technology professor at Georgetown University, said that the deal allows for “more theoretical room for one side’s views to get a greater airing.”\n\n“My worry all along is that we may have traded fears of foreign propaganda for the reality of domestic propaganda,” he added.\n\nThere are also lingering concerns that ByteDance will still influence the app’s content. In addition to its stake, ByteDance will keep TikTok’s coveted algorithm, which it will license to the new U.S. entity.\n\nThat arrangement may fall short of the 2024 law, which required the sale to end any “operational relationship” between ByteDance and TikTok in the United States, critics said.\n\n“They may have saved TikTok,” said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Hudson Institute. “But the national security concerns are still going to continue.”\n\nThursday’s announcement is something of a mash up of two earlier proposals aimed at distancing TikTok from ByteDance.\n\nThe app’s troubles in the United States started almost at the same time as its stratospheric rise in popularity. It accelerated during the Covid pandemic, as the housebound masses turned to their phones to distract themselves with dance trends and memes.\n\nSoon after, Congress and the first Trump administration grew increasingly anxious that under Chinese law, ByteDance could be forced to provide personal information about Americans to Beijing’s military and intelligence apparatus.\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Trump threatened to ban TikTok. He then unsuccessfully tried to force ByteDance to sell the app to a consortium that included Oracle and Walmart.\n\nTikTok spent years pushing an alternative to a sale. Under that proposal, which the company called Project Texas, Oracle would oversee the app’s American user data on servers in the United States. ByteDance would still produce the app’s code, but its work would be audited by Oracle.\n\nSix years later, negotiators have settled on a consortium arrangement. Oracle is still a major player, and ByteDance is still involved, too.\n\n“We’ve gone round and round and ended up not too far from where we started,” said Lindsay Gorman, a former senior adviser in the Biden administration.\n\nMadison Malone Kircher contributed reporting.",

    "description": "During the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Elon Musk said there's a reason human's don't have longer lifespans.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk says he thinks aging will one day be solved.\n\nThe world's richest man said getting older was a \"very solvable problem\" during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum on Thursday.\n\n\"When we figure out what causes aging, I think we'll find it's incredibly obvious. It's not a subtle thing,\" Musk said. \"The reason I say it's not a subtle thing is because all the cells in your body, you know, pretty much age at the same rate. I've never seen someone with an old left arm and a young right arm ever in my life, so why is that? There must be a clock that is synchronizing across 35 trillion cells in your body,\"\n\nBut Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said there would be some downsides to longer lives.\n\n\"You know, there is some benefit to death, by the way. There's a reason why we don't actually have a longer lifespan, because if people do live for a very long time, I think there's some risk of an ossification of society. Of things getting locked in place,\" he said. \"It may become stultifying. A lack of vibrancy, but that said, do I think we'll figure out ways to extend life and maybe even reverse aging? I think that's highly likely.\"\n\nMusk's surprise appearance was his first time onstage at the World Economic Forum, which he'd previously called \"boring af.\" His conversation with Fink was wide-ranging, but didn't reveal much new information.\n\nDozens of political and business leaders from across the globe gathered in Davos, Switzerland, this week to attend the World Economic Forum. The guest list included President Donald Trump, who made his case for the US to annex Greenland and the US's economic agenda during his address on Wednesday.\n\nTrump's push for Greenland has rattled European leaders and the US markets. It's also shocked Greenlanders, who have spoken against the annexation and the Trump administration.\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" one resident said.\n\nTrump said the US would not use military force to take Greenland, but has leveraged tariffs against European countries in his campaign.\n\nThe weeklong event ends on Friday with closing remarks from WEF President Børge Brende and Saudi Arabia's Minister of Economy and Planning.",

    "title": "From oil shocks to China disruptions, here are 5 black swan events that could derail markets this year",
    "description": "An oil shock, disruptions from China, and NATO conflicts are among BCA's list of unlikely but plausible events that would slam markets in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Oil prices soaring, the world economy falling into a recession, and the NATO alliance dissolving top the list of one research firm's possible black swan events in 2026.\n\nAnalysts at BCA Research listed five unlikely but plausible scenarios that could derail markets in 2026. In a note to clients, the firm said its annual list of potential black swans was slightly different this year and addressed only \"the most important\" risks, given that there are several black swan threats investors are discussing \"ad nauseam.\"\n\n\"It is a sign of the times that white swans are now in the minority,\" a team led by Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at the firm, wrote.\n\nHere's what the firm thinks are the five biggest outlier threats facing markets this year:\n\nOil prices could spiral if the Iranian government collapses. It is a possible event that would jeopardize a significant portion of the world's oil supply, and the inflationary impact of that shock could send the world economy into a recession, the firm speculated.\n\nBCA pointed to recent geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran and estimated there is a roughly 38% chance of a \"massive\" oil supply shock stemming from upheavals in the country. The estimated probability of a \"minor\" oil supply shock is 40%.\n\nA geopolitical shock in the Middle East usually causes crude prices to rise 3% over a month and 10% over three months, according to a historical analysis from BCA.\n\n\"But a real Iran shock would be much bigger than average,\" the firm wrote.\n\nThe strategists acknowledged that President Donald Trump is seeking to avoid an oil supply shock amid pressure from the coming midterm elections. Iran is also incentivized to \"leave oil alone\" in order to avoid attacks from other nations, which should prevent a shock, they said.\n\nThe world's inventory of oil also remains \"substantial\" at around 8 billion barrels, according to estimates from BCA's commodities and energy team.\n\nThe stock market could be in for another bout of turmoil similar to last year's stunning reveal of China's lower-cost AI model if the country pulls ahead of the US in the tech arms race.\n\nChina already spends more on research and development compared to the European Union. Patent applications in the nation also outpace applications in the US, Europe, South Korea, and Japan, BCA said, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nA technological breakthrough in Beijing could hit stock prices elsewhere around the world, BCA said. The firm pointed to the DeepSeek-fueled sell-off that erased $1 trillion $1 trillion from US stocks last year.\n\n\"This episode could happen again,\" BCA wrote.\n\nShould China make more progress on the AI front, OpenAI, ChatGPT's parent, could see its valuation \"evaporate,\" the firm said.\n\nStrategists later added that they saw a 50% chance of the tech bubble bursting this year.\n\nChina could become economically self-sufficient, removing a key constraint that prevents the country from escalating military conflict related to Taiwan, BCA suggested.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 39% probability that tensions between China and Taiwan would escalate this year. They also saw a 25% probability that tensions could break out in a proxy war, and a 7% probability that tensions could break out into a major war.\n\n\"What if China reaches technological self-sufficiency so that it can pursue a maximalist policy abroad?\" strategists wrote. \"If China falls deeper into demographic decline, debt-deflation, and dictatorship, then its powers have already peaked and its best chance for creating a sphere of influence is now.\"\n\nChina's economic statistics, like its industrial production, suggest that the nation is not preparing for war at the moment, the firm noted.\n\n\"It is not flashing red, at least not yet,\" the firm said of risk factors that could lead to military conflict.\n\nRussia could seize territory from a NATO member, sparking military conflict between Russia and the alliance. In the worst-case scenario, Russia could make nuclear threats against NATO, and the US may need to step in to \"restore the 'balance of terror,'\" strategists speculated.\n\nThe firm estimated there is a 10% probability of a Russia-NATO war.\n\n\"Russia is currently engaged in a campaign to sabotage Europe's critical infrastructure. The US's lack of solidarity with the allies could encourage overreach. Russia could take its provocations too far,\" the BCA wrote.\n\nWhile the firm said it expects Russia to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine this year, it also pointed to the risk that Trump could provide Ukraine with new military support and funding, which could lead Moscow to become more aggressive in its war with Kyiv.\n\n\"Russia, endangered by the new demands of a longer war against a superior opponent, and having missed the chance to negotiate a favorable ceasefire, could become desperate and even more dangerous,\" the firm added.\n\nShould Russia attack another NATO nation and the US doesn't come to their defense, the alliance would become a \"dead letter,\" BCA said.\n\nAlternatively, the US could also invade Greenland and cause the alliance to dissolve, the firm said, though Trump ruled out using military force to acquire the territory.\n\nBCA said it doubted either scenario would occur, but pegged a 30% probability that the US could harm NATO in some way.\n\n\"The president is determined to seize Greenland at any cost, and to insist on the full extent of his constitutional power as executive and commander-in-chief, then obviously he could conquer Greenland, to hell with the consequences,\" strategists wrote.",

    "description": "Paramount is giving more power to a streaming data and insights executive as part of David Ellison's plan to make Paramount into a tech-first company.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is showing that his tech-first vision for Paramount Skydance isn't just talk.\n\nEllison is taking his data-focused strategy to a new level by elevating Jason Kim, Paramount's EVP of data and insights, to oversee data for the entire company, instead of just the direct-to-consumer division.\n\nThe change was announced by Domenic DiMeglio — who heads up marketing as well as data and insights for Paramount's streaming division — in a Thursday afternoon staff meeting, a recording of which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\nKim's increased remit comes a day after Ellison, Paramount's CEO, met with company leadership in its New York offices.\n\n\"It's a wonderful opportunity for Jason — and for the team overall — to start playing a bigger role for what's happening at Paramount as we move forward,\" DiMeglio said in the meeting.\n\nDiMeglio added that Kim's bigger role is part of \"David's vision of trying to transform ourselves into being a tech-first media company — and, really, the most tech-forward media company in this space.\"\n\nEllison has remade Paramount in other ways since taking control of the company in August, including securing US UFC rights, hiring Bari Weiss to lead CBS News, and attempting to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhile Paramount already had data and analytics teams across the company, it now has a new point person to oversee those efforts.\n\n\"I would hope and expect that, little by little, we're going to bring those silos down,\" DiMeglio said. He added it's \"not easy work.\"\n\nDane Glasgow, Paramount's chief product officer, said in an email to employees that \"these updates are part of a broader effort to focus our investments, reduce fragmentation, and move faster as one team.\"\n\nParamount's streaming team has become familiar with change. Last week, Paramount's streaming product and tech chief, Vibol Hou, told colleagues he was leaving at the end of January, Business Insider reported.\n\n\"You could probably sense that there's been some musical chairs stuff going on within the organization at large,\" Kim said. \"And that's not unique. That's sort of true of any company that's undergoing a large-scale organizational transformation, like the one that we're in the midst of now.\"\n\nContinuing the musical chairs analogy, Kim said that this change signals that \"this is our chair — we're here to stay.\"\n\nAlthough Paramount laid off about 1,000 employees in October, a few months after its Skydance merger closed, Kim downplayed the idea that this data and insights shake-up signals that more cuts are ahead.\n\n\"I don't think our scope is going to get smaller here. It is only going to get larger,\" Kim said. \"And I think those are all exciting tailwinds for us as a team.\"\n\nKim added that \"there might be more consolidation in the future, but that's going to be into our team.\"\n\nTwo Paramount employees in the meeting told Business Insider they were happy to hear about the change.\n\n\"It is exciting, given that we will have a lot more visibility than we used to,\" one employee on this team said.\n\nAnother staffer said this change indicates that Paramount is \"somewhat serious about the 'tech'-ification of the company.\"",

    "description": "A local news site compiled a list of over 200 businesses that have said they'll join an economic blackout day to protest ICE presence in Minnesota.",
    "fullText": "On Friday, Vanessa Beardsley is inviting her community to come hang out with cats and drink coffee at her Minnesota business, Catzen Coffee — but they won't be able to spend any money.\n\nCatzen is participating in a January 23rd economic shutdown, in which activists are calling on Minnesotans to close their businesses, not report to work or school, and refrain from shopping in protest of ICE's presence in the state.\n\nBeardsley said she \"immediately\" knew she wanted to \"stand in solidarity with our fellow businesses and our state,\" but didn't want to completely close her doors. \"We are not doing business,\" she said, \"but we will be open for people who just need a space to come and hang out.\"\n\nIt's unclear how widespread participation in the blackout will be or what impact it may have on ICE operations. Local news site Bring Me The News has compiled a running list of more than 200 businesses that have posted on social media that they will be participating. The shutdown, prompted by ICE officer Jonathan Ross's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, has been endorsed by a slew of regional labor unions, whose demands include ICE leaving the state and no additional federal funding for the agency.\n\n\"Working people, our schools and our communities are under attack. Union members are being detained commuting to and from work, tearing apart families,\" Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, said in a statement. \"Parents are being forced to stay home, students held out of school, fearing for their lives, all while the employer class remains silent.\"\n\nICE didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration's immigration operations \"have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets.\"\n\n\"Making American communities safer will create an environment in which all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"ICE gets beat up by stupid people, from leadership in Minnesota,\" Donald Trump said in a speech at Davos this week. \"We actually are helping Minnesota so much, but they don't appreciate it. Most places do.\"\n\nIn addition to the larger shutdown, there's a march set to run through downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. CT. The state is expected to be under extreme cold warnings and extreme cold watch throughout the day on Friday, which might also keep Minnesotans home. Some local businesses are also opting to stay open, but planning to donate a share of — or all — of their profits to related causes.\n\n\"I understand why people are choosing to participate in the January 23 blackout, and I support those decisions,\" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement to Business Insider. \"At the same time, our small businesses, especially immigrant-owned businesses, are under a lot of pressure right now, and they could really use our support. However you choose to show up, I hope we keep our neighbors and local businesses in mind.\"",

They are also recommending that people charge all electronic communication devices in case of power outages.

    "fullText": "The lifestyles of the rich and famous often include mansions in California, penthouses in the big city, and maybe a small pied-à-terre in a foreign country. But as politics becomes an increasingly divisive topic in the United States, some more celebrities are moving out of the country — or saying that they will.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi moved to England from California in response to the 2024 election results. Rosie O'Donnell — thanks to her Irish grandparents — is in the process of becoming an Irish citizen, citing the current US political climate as her reason for moving in a TikTok video. Other celebrities like Laverne Cox and Cher have vowed to leave the States but haven't yet.\n\nThis isn't exactly a new trend. During the 2016 US presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, many stars vocally opposed Trump and threatened to leave America if he won. Now, with Trump's second term underway, celebrities are again considering relocating — not that the Trump administration is too upset.\n\n\"Good riddance!\" White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers told BI when asked for the administration's response.\n\nCelebrities aren't the only ones exploring a new place to live. Search interest for \"move abroad\" shows that peak interest occurred in November 2024. Though interest has since cooled off, it's still higher than in previous years.\n\nBureaucracy.es, an immigration services site that helps Americans moving to Spain with the visa application process, told CNN in December 2024 that it's seen over 300% more clients book consultations since the November election.\n\nHere are 10 celebrities who have moved abroad, or say they will for political reasons.\n\nOlivia Singh contributed to previous versions of this post.\n\nIn late November 2024, TheWrap reported that comedian Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, left their Montecito home for the Cotswolds, England. The publication said their move to the countryside was triggered by Trump's election and a source said they're \"never coming back.\"\n\nAn August 2025 Us cover story notes that DeGeneres told English broadcaster and host Richard Bacon during a July 20 event that she and DeGeneres were in the Cotswolds when the election results came in. \"We were like, 'We're staying here. We're not going back,'\" DeGeneres told Bacon on their reaction to Trump's victory.\n\nAccording to the Us story, DeGeneres and de Rossi have since moved from the original home they purchased in the Cotswolds and now live in a 10,000-square-foot country home called Hiaven. The pair tend to their chickens, sheep, and horses and walk to the local pub for lunch.\n\nIn a video recently posted on TikTok, Rosie O'Donnell confirmed that she moved from the US to Ireland with her youngest daughter, Dakota. The actor relocated on January 15, days before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"Although I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, that's what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child,\" O'Donnell said in the video.\n\nThe talk show host, who has Irish grandparents, said her experience so far has been \"pretty wonderful\" and she's in the process of getting Irish citizenship.\n\nO'Donnell said that she misses her four other kids and her friends, but will remain in Ireland for the time being.\n\n\"I miss many things about life there at home, and I'm trying to find a home here in this beautiful country,\" she said. \"And when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that's when we will consider coming back.\"\n\nUK-born actor Sophie Turner moved to America after marrying singer Joe Jonas. The couple first lived together in Los Angeles and later in Miami with their two daughters Willa and Delphine. Turner and Jonas sold their Miami home in August 2023 and news of their plans to divorce broke weeks later.\n\nIn an interview with Harper's Bazaar published in October 2024, Turner said that she was homesick while living in the US and struggled with the country's politics. Turner has since moved to West London.\n\n\"The gun violence, Roe v Wade being overturned... Everything just kind of piled on,\" Turner said.\n\nAfter the 2022 Uvalde shooting, in which 19 elementary school children and two teachers were killed, Turner said she \"knew it was time\" to leave.\n\nIt was no secret that Barbra Streisand wanted Hillary Clinton to beat Trump in the 2016 election.\n\n\"He has no facts,\" Streisand told Australian \"60 Minutes\" host Michael Usher in a 2016 interview prior to the election. \"I don't know, I can't believe it. I'm either coming to your country, if you'll let me in, or Canada.\"\n\nStreisand didn't move out of the US, but she did criticize Trump in her 2018 studio album \"Walls.\"\n\nIn a 2023 interview with Stephen Colbert, Streisand said that she liked Joe Biden and thought he did a \"good job.\" When asked about the possibility of a second Trump administration, Streisand again said she'd move.\n\n\"I can't live in this country if he became president,\" she said, adding that she'd probably move to England.\n\nPer an Instagram post shared in early January amid the Los Angeles wildfires, it appears that Streisand still lives in Northern California. Reps for Streisand did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nIn November 2016, Page Six reported that Cher threatened to move if Trump was elected.\n\n\"I'm gonna have to leave the planet,\" she reportedly said at a fundraiser for Clinton.\n\nShe had a similar stance before Trump officially ran for reelection.\n\n\"I almost got an ulcer the last time,\" she told The Guardian in October 2023. \"If he gets in, who knows? This time I will leave [the country].\"\n\nHowever, as of publication, it doesn't appear that Cher has relocated. Reps for Cher did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nDays after the 2024 presidential election, \"Orange Is the New Black\" star Laverne Cox appeared on the podcast \"Just for Variety\" and spoke about the impact the results would have on the transgender community.\n\nCox said that she and some friends were considering moving, but no plans have been solidified yet.\n\n\"We're doing research on different cities in Europe and in the Caribbean,\" Cox said.\n\n\"I don't want to be in too much fear, but I'm scared,\" the actor added. \"As a public figure, with all my privilege, I'm scared, and I'm particularly scared because I'm a public figure. I feel like I could be targeted.\"\n\nAt the 2016 Matrix Awards, \"Girls\" actor Lena Dunham said that she was serious about moving if Trump won the election.\n\n\"I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will,\" Dunham said. \"I know a lovely place in Vancouver and I can get my work done from there.\"\n\nBut after the election results, Dunham changed her mind.\n\n\"I can survive staying in this country, MY country, to fight and live and use my embarrassment of blessings to do what's right,\" she wrote in part in a note shared on Instagram.\n\n\"It's easy to joke about moving to Canada,\" she added. \"It's harder to see, and to love, the people who fill your mailbox with hate. It's harder to see what needs to be done and do it. It's harder to live, fully and painfully aware of the injustice surrounding us, to cherish and fear your country all at once. But I'm willing to try. Will you try with me?\"\n\nDunham did eventually leave her home in New York and moved to London. However, in an interview with the New Yorker published in July 2024, the actor said the move was prompted by work opportunities.\n\nRobin Wright, known for her roles in \"Forrest Gump\" and \"House of Cards,\" relocated to England for work and decided to make the move permanent.\n\nWright spends most of her time in the Chiltern Hills, a rural part of England about 44 miles outside London, and enjoys the peace and quiet it offers compared to her former home of Los Angeles.\n\n\"They're living,\" Wright told UK publication The Sunday Times in August. \"They're not in the car in traffic, panicked on a phone call, eating a sandwich. That's most of America. Everything's rush, competition and speed.\"\n\nWright mentioned during an appearance on The View that the UK's tax breaks make it advantageous for production, which is why she relocated there in the first place, but she's enjoyed her break from the US.\n\n\"I'm troubled, like many of us are, about this state of our country,\" Wright said. \"It's not the reason, I just — I'm so tranquil over there.\"\n\n\"Pretty Woman\" star Richard Gere and his wife Alejandra Silva sold their house in Connecticut for $10.75 million in November 2024 and moved to Spain.\n\nGere said the plan was to be closer to Silva's family in Spain, but on his way out of the country, he had some choice words about the US.\n\n\"We're in a very dark place in America where we have a bully and a thug who's the president of the United States,\" Gere said during a speech at Spain's Goya Awards in February.\n\nSilva told The Daily Mail that the move was not permanent, and that they plan on going back and forth between Spain and the US.\n\n\"We're always coming back,\" she said. We'll come back here in the summer because we have the kids at camp. We just have to balance our lives there and here.\"\n\nThe billionaire filmmaker has been visiting New Zealand since the 1990s, but he set roots there once the pandemic hit in 2020.\n\nSince then, Cameron has had another reason for staying.\n\n\"I'm not there for the scenery, I'm there for the sanity,\" he said in a January 2026 episode of \"In Depth with Graham Bensinger.\"\n\nAlong with supporting how New Zealanders handled the pandemic, Cameron has also voiced his opposition to Donald Trump. That led to Camera not just living there, but also making all his \"Avatar\" movies in the country. He became a citizen of New Zealand in 2025.\n\n\"I think it's horrifying,\" he told the New Zealand outlet Stuff in 2025 about Trump's reelection. \"I see it as a turn away from everything decent. America doesn't stand for anything if it doesn't stand for what it has historically stood for. It becomes a hollow idea, and I think they're hollowing it out as fast as they can for their own benefit.\"",

    "title": "10 Google Search Hacks Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "These tips can help you get better search results.",
    "fullText": "It's not just you. Google Search has become significantly worse in recent years. In the past, you only had to watch out for low-quality content filled with SEO-bait keywords. Today, you have to be wary of AI-generated garbage, misinformation, and a generally worse UI. Still, it's not impossible to find good search results on Google. I've found a number of tricks that have helped me reduce the number of low-quality entries Google returns for my searches. Here are 10 such tips everyone should know about before their next search:\n\nI'm still annoyed by Google's decision to slap AI right at the top of search results, and I make it a point to get rid of it every time I use a new browser or a new device. Doing this is much harder if you're using the Google Search app, so stick to web browsers if you want to rid yourself of AI results. To that end, there are actually a few easy ways to remove AI from Google's results. The quickest is to add -ai to your search queries and Google will remove AI results. Alternatively, you can try using the Hide Gemini browser extension.\n\nGoogle's best days were when it showed a simple page with 10 blue links the moment you searched for anything. If you want to return to that simplicity, you can use the Web search filter in Google. Once you search for something on Google, click the More button below the search bar up top, and select Web. This will remove all the clutter from Google Search and return 10 webpages at a time. If you use Chrome, you can simply type \"web\" in the address bar to start a Web search.\n\nI've also written about a browser extension called Lucky, which does the same thing in Safari for iPhone. Lucky is available at a one-time fee of $3, and, in my opinion, it's well worth the price.\n\nIf you know the domain you want to visit, you can limit your search to that domain alone. For example, you could restrict results to .gov if you only want to look at official US government sites, or .fr if you only wish to search websites registered in France. Just add site:.gov (or any other domain of your choice) to your search queries, and you'll find better results that way. It's also useful if you want to restrict searches to .ac.uk or .edu sites, which are more education-focused.\n\nIf you've found a trusted source that you like, such as Lifehacker, you can use Google to restrict your results only to that website. You can add site:lifehacker.com to your queries on Google, and it'll only show you results from this website. Just replace the name of the site with whichever one you like. This method is often better than using that site's internal search tools, too.\n\nWhen you're looking for specific information, you may be better off searching for a particular file format. For instance, if you're looking for scientific articles, you may have a better chance of finding a pdf file than a web result. In these cases, you can use the filetype:pdf filter to locate pdf files, and you can replace the file type to locate results in a different file format.\n\nIf you're finding significantly worse results using Google search, you can try to refine the results by using Google's built-in filters. Just below the search bar, you'll see a few tabs such as All, News, More, Tools, etc. Click through each of these to eliminate certain types of results. Specifically, the Tools tab lets you refine results by date, and even allows you to remove results for related search terms and focus only on exact matches.\n\nSometimes, basic Google search tools just aren't good enough to find what you need. This is particularly true when your search terms include words that are popular for other reasons. For instance, you're searching \"president,\" but not the president of your country. This is where advanced search could help you remove unwanted results. You can go to the Google Advanced Search page and use all the filters there to find what you need. Each filter has a helpful description right next to it, which makes it easy to figure out what you're doing.\n\nGoogle also allows you to upload files and images to find results. Open Google search and click the + button in the search bar to upload a file or an image. You can attach a query to the image, and Google will help answer that question, or you can even look for images similar to the one you've uploaded. This can be useful if you want to detect fake profiles online, as scammers often steal profile photos from others to create a fake identity.\n\nIf you can't always be bothered with using various manual methods to hide all the junk from your Google Search results, consider using a content blocker to do so. My favorite has long been uBlock Origin, which is available on desktop and on mobile. It'll remove all sponsored results, unwanted product listings, and most types of junk from your Google results.\n\nIf you really like and trust certain websites, you should add those as preferred sources on Google. This will ensure that results from those sites are highlighted among search results and the Top Stories section in your search results. Google rolled this feature out in 2025, and it's the most effective way to find information from higher quality websites. If you'd like, you can click this link to add Lifehacker as a preferred source.",

    "title": "Where to Stream Every Nominated Movie Before the 2026 Oscars",
    "description": "Prepare for Hollywood's big night by watching everything you can before the ceremony on March 15.",
    "fullText": "It's Oscar season! By which I mean, it's that time of year when movie dorks are in a rush to catch up on as many Oscar-nominated films as is feasible before the awards ceremony kicks off—which, this year, will be on March 15 on ABC. If box office and streaming numbers are any indication, there's a good chance you've seen this year's nominations front-runner, Sinners, which didn't just receive the most nominations in 2026, but received the most nominations ever (can't say I'm mad about it), but the second-most nominated movie of the year, Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, is also readily available.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't yet easily stream major nominees like Marty Supreme, Hamnet, and The Secret Agent, which are still making the rounds in theaters. It's also too early to stream the likes of Sirât, The Voice of Hind Rajab, Kohuko, Viva Verdi!, Arco, Zootopia 2, and Avatar: Fire and Ash, though there's a good chance that will change before the first envelopes are torn open. I'll continue to update this article as more movies drop on digital platforms. Unless your a hardcore cinema-goer, you should have plenty to occupy your eyeballs until then.\n\n16 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actor (Michael B. Jordan), Supporting Actor (Delroy Lindo), Actress (Wunmi Mosako), Directing (Ryan Coogler), Original Screenplay, Original Song (\"I Lied to You\"), Original Score, Casting, Cinematography, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Costume Design, Production Design, Sound, Visual Effects\n\nRyan Coogler's Sinners didn't just do pretty well with the nominations—it did historically well. The previous record has stood at 14 since 1950, when All About Eve deservedly won the night. Titanic and La La Land matched that number, but it's never been beaten until now (the addition of the new Best Casting category helping matters just a bit). Nominations aren't trophies—La La Land didn't wind up winning the actual Best Picture prize—but it's still a notable achievement.\n\nIt's also an Oscar rarity in another sense: Sinners is one of a very small handful of horror movies to be nominated for Best Picture and may well be only the second (after Silence of the Lambs) to win. Stream Sinners on HBO Max and Prime Video.\n\n13 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), Supporting Actor (Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn), Supporting Actress (Teyana Taylor), Director (Paul Thomas Anderson), Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Editing, Original Score, Production Design, Sound, Casting\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson, you will always be famous where Oscar is concerned. The director's dark comedy/action thriller earned a very impressive 13 nominations, including a Best Actor nod for Leonardo DiCaprio and supporting nominations for Teyana Taylor and Benicio Del Toro. Stream one Battle After Another on HBO Max.\n\n9 Nominations for: Best Picture, Supporting Actor (Jacob Elordi), Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Costume Design, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score, Production Design, Sound\n\nPerpetual Oscar fave Guillermo del Toro's long-gestating Frankenstein adaptation finally made it to theaters (albeit briefly—it's mostly a Netflix thing) this year, and the result was worth the wait. Sumptuous and appropriately horrifying, the director did Mary Shelley proud, and the film earned a very respectable nine nominations along the way. The all-time number of Frankenstein movies runs into the hundreds, but I'm pretty sure that this is the first one to get any significant Oscar love. Stream Frankenstein on Netflix.\n\n9 nominations for: Best Picture, Actress (Renate Reinsve), Supporting Actor (Stellan Skarsgård), Supporting Actress (Elle Fanning), Supporting Actress (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas), Director (Joachim Trier), Original Screenplay, International Film, Editing\n\nThis Norwegian import from director Joachim Trier (The Worst Person in the World, which also starred Best Actress nominee Renate Reinsve) managed to pick up nominations in both the International Film and overall Best Picture categories. It's probably a long shot for the latter, but has a solid shot at the former. (Between this and Predator: Badlands, Elle Fanning had a great 2025.) Rent Sentimental Value from Prime Video.\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Actress (Emma Stone), Adapted Screenplay, Original Score\n\nThis is the fifth Yorgos Lanthimos film to receive Oscar nominations in major categories, and the third that's up for Best Picture, following Poor Things a few years back, but the acclaimed, idiosyncratic director has yet to claim a trophy of his own. Stream Bugonia on Peacock.\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Editing, Sound, Visual Effects\n\nHeeeey it's that Apple movie that I saw a million ads for (Brad Pitt: The Movie\") that's apparently pretty good? I don't know, I'm not a car guy. But director Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick) sure knows how to film things going fast. Stream F1: The Movie on Apple TV+\n\n4 Nominations for: Best Picture, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Original Song (\"Train Dreams\")\n\nClint Bentley's historical drama is slow, absolutely, but in a modern cinema landscape of constant distraction and over-explanation, its contemplative beauty feels revolutionary. Stream Train Dreams on Netflix.\n\n2 Nominations for: Original Song (\"Golden\"), Animated Film\n\nI'd have put this one up for the overall Best Picture trophy as well, but that's just me. Pure joy, and very likely to take home both of these awards (if \"Golden\" loses Best Original Song, the pre-teen set is likely to riot). Stream KPop Demon Hunters on Netflix.\n\n2 Nominations for: Actor (Ethan Hawke), Original Screenplay\n\nBesties Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke reunited to tell the story of Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart on the opening night of Oklahoma!. It sounds like a real niche movie, but it is well worth seeking out—Hawke is definitely a stealth contender for Best Actor. Rent Blue Moon from Prime Video.\n\n2 Nominations for: Original Screenplay, International Film\n\nA group of Iranian political prisoners, now free, must decide whether and in what way to take revenge in this film, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes last year but missed out on a Best Picture nomination. Rent It Was Just an Accident from Prime Video.\n\nNomination for: Actress (Rose Byrne)\n\nRose Byrne picks up a nomination for her role as a mother who's going through it. (I've heard this one called \"the Uncut Gems of parenting movies.\") Rent If I Had Legs I'd Kick You from Prime Video.\n\nNomination for: Supporting Actress (Amy Madigan)\n\nWas there any more memorable screen presence in 2025 than Aunt Gladys? No, there was not—even before that scene where...what happened to her...happened. Stream Weapons on HBO Max.\n\nThis might not be Pixar's best-reviewed film, but the story of a kid who becomes an inadvertent alien ambassador is pretty darn charming, nonetheless. Stream Elio on Disney+.\n\nNomination for: Actress (Kate Hudson)\n\nThe premise, dealing with the real-life, occasionally tragic story of a Neil Diamond tribute band, sounds like something I made up.

    "title": "Six Ways to Use Staging Psychology to Sell Your House",
    "description": "Staging a house isn’t just making it look clean and neat—it’s about manipulating folks to see themselves in the space.",
    "fullText": "Selling a house is one of the largest transactions most of us will ever make. Considering how much you’ve invested in the place in terms of both money and sweat equity, it’s natural to want to get as much profit from the sale as possible. One strategy to maximize profits that most real estate professionals will recommend is staging: temporarily dressing, furnishing, and arranging the home to make it as appealing as possible.\n\nStaging works—it’s been shown to speed up the time to sale and to increase the sale price of a house. But it’s not magic—there’s a specific psychology to staging a house that you have to keep in mind, especially if you’re choosing to do it yourself in order to save a few bucks. It might seem like all you need to do is freshen the paint, clean the place up, and make a few furnishing choices, but if you want to get the most bang for your staging buck, you should keep staging psychology in mind.\n\nThe first thing to know about house staging psychology is the fundamental purpose of staging: It’s not to make the house look clean or presentable—it’s to shape a narrative. Essentially, you’re telling prospective buyers how they could live in your home. From where they’ll have their morning coffee to where they’ll entertain, you want to help them imagine what life will be like in the house. The easier you make it for people to see themselves living their ideal life there, the easier it will be to close the sale.\n\nIn order to support that narrative, there are specific psychological levers you’ll be pulling as you stage.\n\nFirst impressions really do matter, and the first staging psychology lever you’ll pull is what’s known as the “primacy effect.” This is a common cognitive bias wherein the first impression we get of something influences our perceptions in an outsized way. In other words, if the first impression people get from your home is that it’s luxurious and comfortable, this will override any negative impressions they get later in the house tour.\n\nStaging itself helps with this, of course, but you should also focus on the curb appeal and the entryway of the house to really cement that first impression as positive. Then, consider the fact that each room or space within the house will also offer its own first impression—that’s why decluttering is so vital. Clearing out your stuff and leaving behind a clean, curated visual will let potential buyers see a house they can easily move into, instead of getting an impression that they’d be buying a lot of chores.\n\nThe next bit of staging psychology you need to implement is anchoring—you want buyers to see the house as valuable right away so that impression gets anchored in their heads. This is why staged homes tend to sell for higher prices.\n\nThis involves staging with expensive-looking furniture, if you can, and decorating in a luxe way that implies high value. Seeing high-end decor, smart technology, and other expensive features cements in people’s minds that this is a high-value house, and they will be more willing to pay a premium for it because of that perceived value. Anchoring this value also lets you use the next bit of staging psychology—the Halo Effect.\n\nThe Halo Effect is a cognitive bias where a positive impression prevents you from seeing the flaws or downsides. If your property is a bit old or needs some work, staging it with a fresh, luxe look not only anchors a higher value in buyer’s minds, it can actually cause them to overlook those flaws. Even if they’re aware of some of the problems on one level, the overall sense of value and comfort is what will drive their decision-making.\n\nIt’s important to note that you shouldn’t try to conceal problems or needed upgrades; that would be unethical. The goal here is to let the staging drive a potential buyer’s enthusiasm so they willingly overlook those problems in favor of the comfortable, high-value narrative you’ve constructed.\n\nA key aspect of staging is triggering an emotional response in folks touring your house. Your goal is to make them imagine living there, and to make that fantasy one they associate with positive emotions. To do that, you’ll engage their senses:\n\nLighting. Soft lighting and a focus on natural light creates a warm, inviting atmosphere.\n\nScent. A house that smells fresh and clean is a comfortable space that doesn’t hint at a lot of work to be done. (Pro tip: Get someone who doesn’t live there to sniff the place out; we often become nose-blind to how our house smells.) You can also try to trigger a sense of nostalgia with the tried-and-true trick of baking some cookies. Don’t go overboard—an entire can of air freshener, a house that smells overwhelmingly of cookies, or a house that smells like you just cleaned it using buckets of bleach can backfire. Subtlety is key.\n\nAspiration. We all know there’s the way we think we’re going to live our lives, and then there’s reality. You want to offer potential buyers the fantasy. Maybe you don’t spend time cozied up in a reading nook with a good book and a cup of tea, for example, but you wish you did—so create that reading nook for buyers to picture themselves in. Their emotional attachment to the idea will make them more positive about the house overall.\n\nWhen staging a house, an easy psychological approach is to group things—furniture, decorations, lighting, even color palettes—using the Rule of Three. This is exactly what it sounds like: Arranging things in subtle groups of odd numbers (typically three) and arranging them to have some height and texture variety. The psychological effect is that this is perceived as more natural and less “stagey” than even numbers, and odd numbers tickle the brain’s need for symmetry, so people will be more engaged with your house.\n\nFinally, you want to make a buyer’s path to imagining themselves living in your clean, fresh, artfully decorated home as easy as possible—so get rid of yourself. Decluttering and depersonalizing doesn’t mean bare walls and empty rooms, it means going neutral with your decor and artwork. Get rid of the hobbies, the personal collections, and that weird lamp everyone else hates. Leaving some personal touches, like a few tasteful photos of the family, is a good idea—you don’t want the house to feel like a hotel. But you also don’t want people to feel like they’re intruding, or like they’re picking their way through your dirty laundry.",

    "title": "Here's How Long It Really Takes to Form a New Habit",
    "description": "It's not 21 days, or even 66 days, no matter what the life hack industrial complex wants you to think.",
    "fullText": "Forming a habit is a powerful tool. You work the new thing into your daily routine, and soon enough, it becomes automatic. That's the dream, anyway—in reality, you have to work at it. But how long does it take to fully form a habit? Despite what you may have heard, it’s not necessarily just 21 days.\n\nThe number of days it takes to form a new habit depends on the habit, on you, and on what strategies you’re using to build and maintain that habit. Scientific estimates have ranged from as little as 21 days, to eight months or more. Let’s look at why that range is so big, and what you can do to build habits faster.\n\nThe idea that a habit takes 21 days to form came from a surgeon, Maxwell Maltz. He observed that it seemed to take about three weeks for a person to get used to their new body after an operation like amputation or plastic surgery, James Clear writes. (Having gone through a few minor surgeries, I recall that it takes between two and three weeks for pain and swelling to subside enough that you aren’t constantly thinking about the fact you just had surgery; I have to wonder if that’s related.)\n\nThe surgeon’s idea was that it takes 21 days for people to dissolve and re-form a “mental image” of themselves. This isn’t backed by research; it’s just one guy’s gut feeling. But I think it stuck because it fits a lot of our experiences.\n\nLet’s say you want to get up early to exercise first thing in the morning. Well, of course you can do it once. But how do you make it a habit? When I was in that situation—becoming a morning exerciser despite not being a morning person—I made myself commit for a full week before I even allowed myself to complain about it or adjust my plan. I had to be up at 6 a.m. every day, five days in a row, non-negotiable. I enjoyed having a break on the weekend, and then the second week was much easier. By the end of the third, this really was my new normal. I kept it up for at least a year after that.\n\nEven though the 21-day rule isn’t based on science, it’s a good timeframe for a “trial run” of a new habit. After all, one day can be a fluke. One or two weeks is a timeframe we’ve been through before, and we can ride out a disruption to our normal life that long (imagine a vacation, or a week’s crunch time before a work deadline). But by the time you get to three weeks, or better yet, a full month, you’ve learned some things about your new habit and how it fits into your life. Even the simplest habits are never actually simple; you need to learn and practice a bunch of mini-skills in the process of building almost any habit.\n\nSo, by that 21-day mark, you’ve done the thing a bunch of times. Importantly, you’ve likely weathered a few interruptions or obstacles (like the weekend) and gotten back on track. It’s probably a good rule of thumb for a timeframe that is long enough to feel like “real life.” But that doesn’t mean it’s enough.\n\nScientific research has attempted to measure how long it takes for a habit to truly become automatic. For example, this study asked participants to choose a habit and to attach it to something they did once a day (for example, “eat a piece of fruit with lunch”). The study lasted 12 weeks. Some of the participants felt their new habit was automatic after just a few weeks; many others weren’t there yet at the end of the study. The researchers concluded that most people would form an automatic habit anywhere between two and eight months...according to a model that they calculated would only apply to 62 (about 75%) of the participants.\n\nThat’s a wide range, and we don’t know whether the rest of the people would have ever gotten to a point where the habit was automatic. The researchers also found that simpler habits (like drinking water) were quicker to become automatic than harder or more complex ones (like doing 50 sit-ups).\n\nA 2012 review looked at several other estimates and concluded that it would make more sense to tell people to expect at least 10 weeks for their new habit to become automatic, but also that it helps a lot just to know that any habit keeps getting easier the longer you do it. Those authors point out that expecting a habit to form in 21 days can make people discouraged, and instead it’s better to focus on the payoff of “working effortfully on a new behavior for 2-3 months.”\n\nSetting time-based commitments can be a helpful tool, like getting through the first week before changing the plan, or using your new moisturizer every day until the bottle is empty. But another school of thought holds that long-term behavior change is better described by “stages of change” than by calendar dates. There is a \"contemplation\" stage where you're thinking about how you'll do the new behavior, and a \"preparation stage\" where you're gathering supplies and testing the waters—say, buying new running shoes, or taking one fitness class to see how you like it.\n\nIn some cases, a habit takes longer to form than you hope. But you may be able to get a habit to stick sooner than expected if you are intentional about the way you form the habit. Working consciously on your new habit can make it last longer, too, as we see in the maintenance stage.\n\nYour initial habit-forming period—whether you want to think of it as 21 days, or 66 days, or, heck, eight months—is what behavior change psychologists call the action stage. You’ve begun the habit, but it’s not automatic yet and you might not be convinced that you’re really going to continue. In this stage, you can make your habit more likely to stick by doing the following:\n\nRemind yourself of your motivation to do it. For example, stick your reminder card for your next dentist’s appointment on your bathroom mirror, so that you remember not just that you should floss your teeth, but also why you want to floss your teeth.\n\nRestructure your environment to give you cues and support. For example, if you want to run every morning, set your shoes out the night before and have your spouse ask you how your run went when you return.\n\nBuild self-efficacy by celebrating your small wins. This could mean checking off the days you did the thing on a calendar, but it could also involve working toward milestones (like total number of miles run) or making benchmarks of your progress (maybe you used to do your daily pushups with your hands on a chair, but now you can do them on the floor).\n\nPlan ahead for how you’ll maintain your habit even when you’re interrupted (more about that in a minute).\n\nOnce you’ve built some momentum, you’re in the maintenance stage. You’re doing the habit, and maybe it’s starting to feel automatic, or at least more of a part of your life than it used to be. In this stage, you may need to do some things like the following:\n\nReevaluate your plan. Is running every day still working for you? Maybe it makes more sense to make some of the runs longer and designate other days for rest, yoga, or strength training.\n\nThink ahead to obstacles you might face. If you go on a vacation, will you continue the habit? If you end up falling off the wagon for whatever reason, how will you get back on?\n\nMake sure your motivation is something that will continue to work for you. For example, if you found it really motivating to keep up a streak on the calendar, the real test will come when you inevitably break your streak. At that point, there needs to be something other than the streak that is keeping you at it. This is often something intrinsic: You like being the person who flosses every day. You’re excited to You’re happy that your cholesterol is down from the way you’ve been eating.\n\nBuilding a habit is not a matter of white-knuckling it until you hit a magic number of days. It’s a process that takes effort the whole time, even when you’re five years in. Habits are work, but the ones that last are the ones where the work feels worthwhile.",

    "fullText": "Tech companies are getting increasingly pushy with their large language models—prominent buttons for these AI features coat every surface designers can think of, including in three of the most prominent browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.\n\nIf you want these AI features to go away, and stay away, there's a script for that. JustTheBrowser is a free and open source tool from developer and tech blogger Corbin Davenport that removes AI features, telemetry data reporting, sponsored content, product integrations, and other annoyances from Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Basically, you can run this once and never think about these features again.\n\nTo get started, head to the JustTheBrowser homepage. There are scripts to copy (which I'm not going to include here in case they change in the future).\n\nWindows users will need to run PowerShell as an admin—the easiest way to do that is by right-clicking PowerShell in the start menu and clicking \"Run as administrator.\" There is a different script for Mac and Linux users—that one just needs to be copied into a regular Terminal.\n\nEither way, you will be asked which browser you'd like to update the settings for—just hit the number corresponding to what you want to do.\n\nIn my testing, the process was very simple on Windows—just click the number and the script will do its thing. On macOS, I needed to follow a few instructions to enable a configuration policy in the Settings app, something that only took a couple of clicks. After that, Chrome was free of any and all references to AI.\n\nA number of other features were also gone, including those annoying prompts to switch my default browser.\n\nThe way this works is kind of interesting: it uses features intended for large organizations. Basically all major browsers allow for group settings, which is how IT departments control what you can and can't do with your browser. Among these settings are ones to disable AI features.\n\nIt's an interesting workaround, and hopefully one that keeps working. There is always a chance that browser companies make it so even IT departments can't disable AI features, at which point we'll all need to find a new solution (or switch to an alternative browser).",

    "title": "A Study Found Diet Coke Is Better for You Than Water (Sort Of)",
    "description": "I won’t say it’s “healthier,” but it certainly doesn’t seem to be any worse.",
    "fullText": "I’m sure you’ve seen the studies that come out from time to time showing that diet sodas are arguably kinda-sorta bad for you. (Their evidence is never very strong.) But did you see the new study that found diet soda was better than water for people with type 2 diabetes? Not only is it a real study, it was well-designed and we should be paying attention to it, according to an epidemiologist I talked to who was not involved in the study.\n\nThat epidemiologist is Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz of the University of Wollongong, who wrote about it here. When I asked him if it was a good or a bad thing that this study had mostly escaped notice by news media, he said “this is far more robust than most of the science that gets media coverage.” The study was not sponsored by any commercial drink company.\n\nIn the delightfully named SODAS trial (Study Of Drinks with Artificial Sweeteners), researchers at the University of California, Irvine, and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, recruited adults who had type 2 diabetes and who had a habit of drinking artificially sweetened beverages (including, but not limited to, my one true love Diet Coke). The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nHalf of them were asked to switch to drinking water instead, and everyone was provided with three servings a day of either their diet drink of choice, or a water of their choice (unsweetened seltzer included). The study ran for 24 weeks. There were 181 people enrolled, of which 179 finished the study, which is considered a fairly large group for a study of this type. (It's twice as large as an older study I'll contrast it with below.)\n\nThe main outcome the researchers studied was hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) as measured by a blood test. This is a common test used to monitor glucose control in people who have diabetes or are at risk for it. The higher your HbA1C, the higher your blood glucose has probably been over the past three months or so.\n\nThe results: HbA1C got slightly better in the group that was drinking artificial sweeteners: from 7.19% to 7.14%. It got worse in the group that was drinking water, from 7.20% to 7.44%.\n\nThe researchers collected a few other metrics, for good measure. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and “time in range” as measured by a continuous glucose monitor all favored the diet drinks group. The people in the diet drinks group lost a little bit of weight (on average, two pounds) while those in the water group had stable weights. The researchers referred to this difference in weight loss as “statistically significant, but not clinically significant.” In other words, probably real, but too small to matter.\n\nBottom line: there was no real benefit to the people in the study switching from diet sodas to water; if anything, doing so may have slightly hurt their health.\n\nOK, maybe I mean me and my Diet Coke habit. I fully admit to being biased here, but in an educated way. I like my Diet Coke. I’ve also been keeping an eye on research about artificial sweeteners over the years, and while I won’t necessarily defend my soda as health food, nothing has ever convinced me that it’s bad for me. (Sugar-sweetened sodas are a different story; those, we should probably all avoid.)\n\nNow, we have a reasonably large, well-designed, independently-funded study showing that artificially sweetened drinks are possibly better for you than water. I still haven’t seen any news coverage of it, even though a study with the opposite results got coverage a few years back. That study involved 81 women with diabetes in a weight-loss trial, and their HbA1C improved slightly with water compared to diet drinks. Even so, one expert that Everyday Health spoke to about it said that he was “of the opinion that the health risks of diet sodas are overstated.” (Meanwhile, the authors of the most recent study point out that comparing that study to theirs isn’t quite apples-to-apples, since it was a weight loss trial and this one is not.)\n\nThat’s an important point to remember about any study on a specific food: they usually apply to a specific medical condition or population. We like to file them away in our mind as “Diet Coke good” or “Diet Coke bad,” but each study only gives us a piece of the puzzle, not a generality. For example this study tells us nothing about Diet Coke’s effects on people who have poorly controlled diabetes, or who don’t have diabetes at all; and it doesn’t say anything about measures other than those related to blood sugar. It didn’t even specifically study Diet Coke, although it’s likely that Diet Coke was one of the more popular beverages participants chose.\n\nTo be clear, it is entirely possible that this isn’t a real effect, and and that water and diet drinks are basically equivalent when it comes to your blood glucose and your health. Meyerowitz-Katz says this is probably the most likely explanation, but we can’t rule out the possibility that diet sodas may help glucose control in type 2 diabetes. Maybe they satisfy a sweet tooth and help people avoid other sugary snacks, for example.\n\nThe researchers write that their main takeaway is that “maintaining usual [artificially-sweetened beverage] intake may be a tool to continue to help manage T2D if glycemic measures are controlled and stable.” Meyerowitz-Katz agrees: “At worst, there is no difference between diet soft drinks and water when it comes to diabetes control. At best, the diet drinks might be sightly better.”",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Greenland's ownership was not Russia's concern and that the United States and Denmark - whose historical treatment ​of the island he criticised - should sort the matter out between themselves.\n\nMoscow has watched ‌with glee as U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to acquire Greenland has widened Washington's split with Europe, even though his moves ‌could have ramifications for Russia, which already has a strong Arctic presence.\n\nSpeaking in Davos, Trump on Wednesday stepped back from threats to impose tariffs as leverage to seize Greenland and ruled out the use of force. He suggested progress towards a deal to end a dispute over the semi-autonomous Danish territory that risked ⁠the deepest rupture in transatlantic relations ‌in decades.\n\nPutin, addressing the matter for the first time in public, signalled that Russia would not object to Trump's push to control Greenland, which he speculated ‍may be worth nearly $1 billion.\n\n\"What happens in Greenland is of no concern to us whatsoever,\" Putin told a meeting of Russia's Security Council.\n\n\"Incidentally, Denmark has always treated Greenland as a colony and has been quite harsh, if not ​cruel, towards it. But that is a different matter altogether, and hardly anyone is interested ‌in it now,\" Putin added.\n\nDenmark's financial and military support for Ukraine has angered Russia, which is fighting to take full control of four Ukrainian regions it claimed as its own in 2022.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry has bridled at Trump's suggestion that Moscow has ambitions on Greenland too, but has been careful not to criticise Trump - who is trying to broker a deal to end the ⁠war in Ukraine - and has hinted it has some sympathy ​for his claim.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that ​the giant resource-rich island, which already has a U.S. military presence, was not \"a natural part\" of Denmark.\n\nPutin recalled that Russia in 1867 sold Alaska to the United ‍States for $7.2 million, and that ⁠Denmark in 1917 sold the Virgin Islands to Washington, setting precedents for such land transactions.\n\nUsing the Alaska price - adjusted for inflation and accounting for the larger size of Greenland and ⁠changes in gold prices, Putin said buying Greenland from Denmark could cost around $1 billion, which he said he thought Washington ‌could afford.\n\n\"I think they will sort it out between themselves,\" said Putin.",

    "description": "These annoying habits are actually a sign of high intelligence.",
    "fullText": "You’ve probably been told you’re “too intense,” “overly analytical,” or “kind of a lot.” Maybe people joke that you’re exhausting, picky, or difficult, even when you’re just being yourself. What often gets labeled as annoying behavior is sometimes just intelligence operating at a different speed or depth than the people around you. If any of these habits sound familiar, it might not be a personality flaw—it might be how your brain actually works.\n\nYou don’t accept surface-level explanations easily, and you’re rarely satisfied with a quick answer. When something doesn’t make sense, you want context, reasoning, and follow-up details. To other people, this can feel like interrogation or nitpicking. To you, it’s basic curiosity and clarity.\n\nCognitive psychology research shows that highly intelligent people are more likely to engage in exploratory questioning because their brains are wired to detect gaps in logic. You’re not trying to challenge authority or slow things down. You’re trying to understand how the system actually works. That depth-first thinking can be uncomfortable for people who prefer shortcuts.\n\nYou replay conversations, decisions, and possibilities long after others have moved on. What looks like anxiety or indecision is often your brain running complex simulations. You’re not stuck—you’re processing. Your mind wants to anticipate outcomes before committing.\n\nStudies on high cognitive ability show that intelligent people engage in more counterfactual thinking, meaning they mentally test multiple scenarios. This helps with long-term decision-making but can look exhausting from the outside. Your brain is doing heavy lifting, even when you’re sitting still. Silence doesn’t mean inactivity.\n\nSmall talk drains you faster than physical work, and repetitive tasks feel unbearable. When there’s nothing mentally stimulating happening, your attention starts wandering immediately. People may think you’re disengaged or rude. In reality, your brain is underfed.\n\nNeuroscience research links boredom sensitivity to higher baseline cognitive processing needs. Your mind requires novelty, complexity, or challenge to stay regulated. When the environment doesn’t provide that, you disconnect. It’s not arrogance—it’s a neurological mismatch.\n\nYou often finish people’s sentences or jump ahead in conversations. This can come across as impatience or dominance. What’s actually happening is that your brain recognized the pattern early. You already see where the thought is going.\n\nHighly intelligent individuals tend to process information faster, especially in familiar domains. Waiting for others to arrive at the same conclusion can feel painfully slow. You’re not trying to steal the spotlight—you’re struggling with pacing differences. Conversation speed isn’t universal.\n\nStep-by-step directions feel irritating when you already understand the underlying concept. You want to know why something works, not just how to follow it. Being told exactly what to do can feel restrictive rather than helpful. Others may interpret this as defiance.\n\nResearch on problem-solving styles shows that intelligent thinkers prefer principle-based learning over rote instruction. You want autonomy, not micromanagement. When systems feel inefficient, your brain pushes back. Compliance without understanding doesn’t feel logical to you.\n\nInaccuracies bother you more than they bother others. When someone states something incorrectly, it feels unresolved until it’s corrected. You’re not trying to embarrass anyone. Your brain wants alignment with reality.\n\nPsychological studies on truth-bias sensitivity show that intelligent individuals experience stronger discomfort with factual inconsistency. Letting errors slide feels mentally itchy. You value accuracy because it protects understanding. Silence can feel dishonest.\n\nYou enjoy solitude not because you dislike people, but because your brain needs space to process. Constant interaction can feel overstimulating. Alone time isn’t loneliness—it’s recovery. Others may see this as antisocial.\n\nResearch on intelligence and introversion shows a strong correlation between high cognitive capacity and lower social stimulation needs. Your mind is already busy. Quiet gives it room to stretch. That preference is regulation, not withdrawal.\n\nWasted time, unnecessary meetings, and roundabout processes irritate you deeply. You see faster, cleaner ways to do things and struggle when systems ignore them. This can make you seem impatient or controlling. Internally, you’re optimizing.\n\nHigh-level problem solvers naturally scan for efficiency gaps. Your frustration comes from seeing potential improvements that aren’t being used. You’re not nitpicking—you’re noticing friction. Efficiency feels calming to your nervous system.\n\nWhen something captures your attention, you go all in. You read everything, watch everything, and think about it constantly—until you don’t. Then you move on just as intensely. Others may think you’re flaky.\n\nThis pattern aligns with intellectual curiosity cycles rather than a lack of commitment. Research on polymathic thinkers shows that deep but temporary immersion is common. You’re collecting frameworks, not hobbies. Each interest feeds the next.\n\nBackground noise that others ignore can completely derail your focus. You notice overlapping sounds, visual clutter, and interruptions immediately. People may accuse you of being dramatic. Your brain is just highly responsive.\n\nSensory processing research shows that intelligent individuals often have heightened perceptual sensitivity. More information is coming in at once. Managing input becomes essential for thinking clearly. Distraction isn’t minor when your processing load is high.\n\nYou don’t automatically accept “that’s just how it’s done.” Rules, traditions, and expectations feel optional if they don’t make sense. This can come across as rebellious or difficult. For you, it’s logical consistency.\n\nIntelligent thinkers are more likely to evaluate norms through reason rather than conformity. You’re not trying to disrupt for fun. You’re checking whether the rule still serves a purpose. Compliance without rationale feels irrational.\n\nYou value clarity over cushioning, especially when discussing ideas. Emotional padding sometimes feels unnecessary or misleading. Others may interpret your directness as harsh. You’re aiming for precision.\n\nLinguistic studies show that intelligent communicators prioritize information density over emotional framing. Your intent isn’t cruelty—it’s accuracy. Tone mismatches often come from differing communication priorities. Meaning gets lost in translation.\n\nConversations that stay superficial for too long drain you. You crave depth, nuance, and big-picture thinking. When discussions never go there, you disengage. Others may see this as arrogance.\n\nIntellectual stimulation is a basic need for you, not a luxury. Research on cognitive engagement shows that intelligent individuals require complexity to stay emotionally invested. Without it, boredom sets in fast. Depth keeps you present.\n\nYou feel things deeply, even when you understand them logically. Your emotional reactions don’t cancel out your intelligence—they coexist with it. This intensity can surprise people who expect smart individuals to be detached. You’re anything but.\n\nPsychological research increasingly links high intelligence with emotional depth rather than emotional distance. You process feelings with the same complexity as ideas. That depth can be overwhelming to others. It’s not instability—it’s capacity.\n\nRelaxation doesn’t come easily because your mind keeps generating connections. Even during rest, ideas keep forming. People may suggest you’re anxious or obsessive. You’re simply wired for constant synthesis.\n\nCognitive studies show that intelligent brains have higher default-mode network activity. Thought generation doesn’t stop just because the day ends. Rest looks different for you. Mental motion is your baseline.",

    "title": "Not AT&T, Not Verizon: This Is JD Power's Overall Best In Wireless Network Quality",
    "description": "Last year, Verizon was the leading wireless network provider in multiple regions around the United States, but this year it passes the crown.",
    "fullText": "According to Vol. 1 of J.D. Power's 2026 U.S. Wireless Network Quality Performance Study, T-Mobile is your best bet for the strongest wireless network quality. The latest edition of the annual study took a look at how consistently top networks place at or near the top across every region measured. And while Verizon Wireless came out ahead in the North Central U.S. and tied T-Mobile in a few others, the magenta-colored mobile network still ended up with fewer problems reported per 100 uses overall.\n\nThat's the study's core metric: PP100. Lower PP100 scores mean better network quality. Essentially, fewer dropped calls, faster data speeds, and fewer connectivity issues during normal device use. Just because T-Mobile's PP100 scores were lowest overall doesn't mean all the other networks in competition aren't worth using, of course. Industrywide, almost all wireless networks are performing at a high level of functionality, with the only exception being AT&T.\n\nWhile J.D. Power reports the national average holding steady at a PP100 score of nine or less over the past year, AT&T was at or above that in every region they measured. The study was based on responses from 20,050 customers surveyed between June and November 2025 and also included feedback on smartphones, tablets, and home internet devices for the most comprehensive view of real-world network reliability.\n\nBig picture, T-Mobile ranks highest outright in the Southeast and Southwest with eight PP100 in both regions. It also ties with Verizon Wireless for the top spot in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and West, with scores ranging from eight to nine PP100 depending on the region. And while T-Mobile is the overall best, Verizon earned the lowest PP100 score on a region-to-region basis, with a six in North Central U.S. AT&T's 11 PP100 in the Northeast is the worst score in the entire study, region-to-region or overall, so it's not hard to see why AT&T is making some major adjustments this year.\n\nThese 2026 findings are a real shake-up compared to last year's. In 2025, Verizon Wireless was the most frequent regional leader, and national average PP100 scores were higher than they are now. Then, customers reported an average of 11 problems per 100 uses, up from nine in 2024. This year, it's back down to nine. Verizon Wireless ranked highest in four regions in 2025: Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, West, and tied with AT&T for the top spot in the Southwest. At the time, T-Mobile claimed first only in the Southeast, and with 11 PP100 to boot. With so many changes coming to T-Mobile in 2026, it'll be interesting to see how next year's findings pan out.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "It’s like nothing around today.",
    "fullText": "Ever since their discovery more than 165 years ago, massive fossilized structures left by an organism known as Prototaxites have proven impossible to categorize.\n\nResearchers in the UK have suggested in a recently published study that there's a very good reason these oddities don't fit neatly on the tree of life – they belong to a branch all of their own, with no modern equivalent.\n\nSome 400 million years ago, the swamps of the late Silurian period would have sprouted a mix of horsetails, ferns, and other prototype plants that look positively alien today.\n\nAmong them stretched 8-meter (26-foot) tall towers that defy easy identification. Wide and branchless, these organisms may have been a form of algae or ancient conifer, researchers suspect, based on what little evidence remains.\n\nFossils found on the shores of Gaspé Bay in Quebec, Canada, were initially considered by geologist John William Dawson to be the remains of rotting trees, leading to his naming it 'first conifer' back in the 1850s.\n\nThough the name stuck, confusion over the fossil's classification continued until National Museum of Natural History paleontologist Francis Hueber confirmed in 2001 that Prototaxites was indeed most likely an enormous fungus.\n\nThat conclusion was backed up years later in 2017 by a subsequent analysis of a fossil fragment assumed to be from the peripheral region of a smaller Prototaxites species named P. taiti.\n\nThe 2017 study claimed to identify textures that resembled the fertile structures of today's Ascomycota fungi.\n\nNot everybody is convinced, however, given the possibility that the distinct fragments might not have even been connected.\n\n\"In the books and books of anatomy written about living fungi, we never find structures like that,\" University of Edinburgh paleobotanist Alexander Hetherington told Erik Stokstad at Science Magazine.\n\nHetherington co-led a study on three different P. taiti fragments, concluding there's insufficient evidence to conclude Prototaxites is a fungus at all.\n\nThrough a review of microscopic anatomy and chemical analysis of its tubular structures, the team of researchers systematically eliminated each and every candidate group, leaving no modern organism with which it might share some kind of ancestral relationship.\n\nFungi? Rejected thanks to the unique way its anatomy connects.\n\nA plant or algae? Not likely given its chemical composition.\n\nA mix of the two, such as a lichen? Not with that anatomy.\n\nSome bizarre animal? Cell walls say no chance.\n\n\"Based on this investigation we are unable to assign Prototaxites to any extant lineage, reinforcing its uniqueness,\" the researchers claim.\n\n\"We conclude that the morphology and molecular fingerprint of P. taiti is clearly distinct from that of the fungi and other organisms preserved alongside it in the [Devonian deposit], and we suggest that it is best considered a member of a previously undescribed, entirely extinct group of eukaryotes.\"\n\nWhat might have happened to this long-dead group of organisms is anybody's guess. Further reviews may even return the mystifying group back to its box among ancient fungi.\n\nWithout similar specimens to relate them to, Prototaxites may simply remain a fossil anomaly – a reminder that evolution is a constant experiment, one littered with far more failures than we may ever have realized.\n\nThis research was published in Science.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in March 2025 before the research was peer-reviewed.\n\nA Cycle Deep Within Earth's Crust May Affect Climate More Than We Thought\n\nClever Cow Documented Using Tools in an Astonishing Scientific First\n\nGigantic Wave in The Pacific Was The Most Extreme 'Rogue Wave' on Record",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which ​Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a ‌U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nWhile the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required ‌that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.\n\n\"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, ⁠the people of Venezuela will ‌collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price,\" the official said.\n\nChina ‍has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.\n\nThe administration is allowing China to buy the oil at \"fair ​market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices\" at which Maduro sold oil to ‌China to pay debts, the official said.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.\n\nTrading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and ⁠the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a ​quarter of the $2 billion agreement.\n\nTrafigura completed its first ​crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero ‍and Phillips 66 and ⁠to its refinery in Italy, sources said.\n\nChina's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave ⁠after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Timothy Gardnerin Washington; Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma in New ‌Delhi; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Andrea Ricci )",

The U.S. Coast Guard declined to comment, directing inquiries to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a ⁠request for a comment.\n\nBecause the vessels' geolocating ‌beacons have not been turned on, the locations of M Sophia and Galileo were unknown until the Tankertrackers.com and witness confirmation on Wednesday.\n\nThe vessels could remain in Puerto Rico or be moved to another ‍U.S. port. The other five captured tankers are near the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Venezuelan waters and near Scotland, shipping data showed.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said the U.S. intervention — including the capture of President Nicolás Maduro on January 3 — is aimed at stopping drug trafficking.\n\nWashington intends to ​direct Venezuela’s government and revive the country’s crippled oil sector by bringing major U.S. oil companies in to rebuild it.\n\nTrump ‌has imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil, which in December brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have accelerated in January under U.S. supervision, but millions of barrels remain in onshore and floating storage.\n\nThe U.S. government has filed for court warrants to seize dozens more tankers linked to the Venezuelan oil trade, sources told Reuters last week. This week, vessel Sagitta was intercepted.\n\nAlong with most tankers under Western sanctions or part of the so-called shadow fleet, many of the Venezuela-linked tankers were ⁠built over 20 years ago and pose hazards to shipping because they ​lack safety certification and adequate insurance, experts said.\n\nThat means that if they have ​a collision or oil spill, establishing insurance claims or liability is very difficult to impossible, shipping and insurance industry sources said.\n\nThe age of these tankers, which exceeds the industry standard of 15 years, also raises ‍concern about potential environmental damage, the ⁠sources said.\n\nU.S. government civil forfeiture claims related to the ship seizures can take months or years to resolve, meaning there may be no immediate solutions to the challenges.\n\n\"These 'dark fleet' tankers can be incredibly unsafe. They are elderly, their crew ⁠work in unsafe conditions, lack the appropriate classification surveys, and they are often backed by fake insurance or no insurance at all,\" said David Tannenbaum, ‌a director at consulting firm Blackstone Compliance Services.",

    "description": "More precious than gold.",
    "fullText": "Amidst a cache of glittering golden treasures from the Iberian Bronze Age, a pair of corroded objects might be the most precious of all.\n\nA dull bracelet and a rusted hollow hemisphere decorated with gold are forged, researchers have found, not out of metal from beneath the ground, but with iron from meteorites that fell from the sky.\n\nThe discovery, led by now-retired head of conservation at the National Archeological Museum in Spain, Salvador Rovira-Llorens, was revealed in a paper in 2024, and suggests that metalworking technology and techniques in Iberia more than 3,000 years ago were far more advanced than we thought.\n\nThe Treasure of Villena, as the cache of 66 mostly gold objects is known, was discovered more than 60 years ago in 1963 in what is now Alicante in Spain, and has since come to be regarded as one of the most important examples of Bronze Age goldsmithing in the Iberian Peninsula, and the whole of Europe.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary:\n\nDetermining the age of the collection has been somewhat difficult, thanks to two objects: a small, hollow hemisphere, thought to be part of a scepter or sword hilt; and a single, torc-like bracelet.\n\nBoth have what archaeologists have described as a \"ferrous\" appearance – that is, they seem to be made of iron.\n\nIn the Iberian Peninsula, the Iron Age – where smelted terrestrial iron began to replace bronze – didn't start until around 850 BCE.\n\nThe problem is that the gold materials have been dated to between 1500 and 1200 BCE. So working out where the ferrous-looking artifacts sit in the context of the Treasure of Villena has been something of a puzzle.\n\nBut iron ore from Earth's crust is not the only source of malleable iron. There are a number of pre-Iron Age iron artifacts around the world that were forged from the stuff of meteorites.\n\nPerhaps most famous is the meteoritic iron dagger of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, but there are other Bronze Age weapons made of the material, and they were very highly prized.\n\nThere is a way to tell the difference: iron from meteorites has a much higher nickel content than iron dug out of Earth's ground.\n\nSo researchers obtained permission from the Municipal Archaeological Museum of Villena, which houses the collection, to carefully test the two artifacts, and determine just how much nickel they contained.\n\nThey carefully took samples of both artifacts and subjected the material to mass spectrometry to determine their composition.\n\nIn spite of the high degree of corrosion, which alters the elemental makeup of the artifact, the results strongly suggest that both the hemisphere and the bracelet were made from meteoritic iron.\n\nThis neatly solves the dilemma of how the two artifacts align with the rest of the collection: They were made around the same period, dating back to around 1400 to 1200 BCE.\n\n\"The available data suggest that the cap and bracelet from the Treasure of Villena would currently be the first two pieces attributable to meteoritic iron in the Iberian Peninsula,\" the researchers explain in their paper, \"which is compatible with a Late Bronze chronology, prior to the beginning of the widespread production of terrestrial iron.\"\n\nNow, because the objects are so badly corroded, the results aren't conclusive. But there are more recent, non-invasive techniques that could be applied to the objects to obtain a more detailed set of data that would help cement the findings, the team suggests.\n\nThe findings were published in Trabajos de Prehistoria.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in February 2024.\n\nWorld's Oldest Rock Art Discovered in Indonesian Cave\n\nOne Change to Your Reading Habit Fights Stress And Misinformation\n\nPlaying Video Games Has an Unexpected Effect on Kids' IQ, Study Says",

    "description": "Integrated energy giant Chevron has a strong business, an attractive yield, and a rock-solid balance sheet.",
    "fullText": "Energy is integral to the world, and every investor should probably have some exposure to the sector.\n\nChevron is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies, providing diversification across the energy sector.\n\nChevron offers an attractive combination of yield and financial strength, relative to its closest peers.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Chevron ›\n\nThe world is trying to shift away from dirtier energy sources, such as coal and oil. However, it's likely to be a long transition. Oil and natural gas will both be needed for decades to come, as the most likely energy strategy is an \"all of the above\" approach.\n\nEvery investor should probably have some exposure to the energy sector. That's the foundational reason why you should consider adding Chevron (NYSE: CVX) to your portfolio. Here are three company-specific reasons why.\n\nThe energy sector is volatile by nature, with oil and natural gas prices rising and falling regularly. You could focus on a narrow niche of the industry, but most investors will be best served by a company with a diversified portfolio of assets that provide exposure to the entire energy value chain. That's what integrated energy companies like Chevron do.\n\nChevron is best known for its oil and natural gas production, which falls into the upstream segment of the industry. However, it also owns energy infrastructure assets, such as pipelines, which help move oil and natural gas around the world.\n\nThat's the midstream. It also owns chemical and refining businesses that operate in the downstream segment of the industry. These businesses process energy into the products that actually get used, like gasoline.\n\nEach segment of the industry operates a little differently through the energy cycle. The best example of the benefit is that low oil prices put pressure on upstream producers but reduce costs in the downstream segment, where oil is a key input into the production of other products. From a foundational perspective, integrated Chevron has an attractive business model.\n\nChevron's dividend yield is currently 4.1%. That's well above the S&P 500 index's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 1.1% yield and the 3.3% yield of the average energy stock. Chevron clearly has an attractive yield on an absolute level.\n\nChevron, however, doesn't have the highest yield among its closest integrated energy peers. That title goes to TotalEnergies at around 5.9%. However, Chevron does have an over 30-year streak of annual dividend increases behind it. That's second in the sector to ExxonMobil's over-40-year streak, but Exxon's yield is only around 3.1%. All in, Chevron is a reliable dividend stock with an attractive yield that stands out from its peers.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — A man accused of offering a $10,000 bounty over Snapchat for the life of a top Border Patrol leader was found not guilty on Thursday in the first criminal trial stemming from the Chicago-area immigration crackdown that started last year.\n\nJurors deliberated less than 4 hours before returning the favorable verdict for 37-year-old Juan Espinoza Martinez. He faced one count of murder-for-hire and up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Testimony lasted mere hours in the federal trial that was the latest test of the Trump administration’s credibility on federal surges that have played out from Minnesota to Maine.\n\nEspinoza Martinez, who wore a suit and tie, listened intently with his arms crossed near his stomach. He hugged his attorneys and shook their hands after court adjourned.\n\nAttorneys for the defense declined comment. Prosecutors did not address reporters waiting in the lobby of the federal court in downtown Chicago. Neither did jurors.\n\nAt the heart of the government’s case were Snapchat messages sent from Espinoza Martinez to his younger brother and a friend who turned out to be a government informant. One read in part “10k if u take him down,” along with a picture of Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official who has led aggressive crackdowns nationwide, including in the Chicago area.\n\n“Those words do not indicate that this was a joke,” First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Yonan told jurors during Thursday's closing arguments. “Those words have meaning. They are not innocent and harmless words.”\n\nBut defense attorneys said the government didn’t show any evidence against Espinoza Martinez who sent the messages as “neighborhood gossip” after coming home from work and unwinding with beers. He didn’t follow up on the exchanges and had only a few dollars in his bank account.\n\n“Sending a message about gossip that you heard in the neighborhood, it’s not murder for hire,” his defense attorney Dena Singer told jurors. “It’s not a federal crime.”\n\nHer office did not return a message seeking comment after the verdict. Neither did the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago or the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn court, prosecutors accused Espinoza Martinez of being “fixated and obsessed” with Bovino and cited other messages where he criticized the crackdown.\n\nEspinoza Martinez was arrested in October as the city of 2.7 million and surrounding suburbs were seeing a surge of federal immigration officers. Protests and standoffs with agents were common, particularly in the city’s heavily Mexican Little Village neighborhood where Espinoza Martinez lived.\n\nHe did not testify at his trial.\n\nBut attorneys played clips of his interview with law enforcement where he said he was confused about the charges and that he sent the messages without much thought while scrolling social media after work.\n\n“I didn’t threaten anyone,” he told investigators, interchanging English and Spanish at times in the interview. “I’m not saying that I was telling them to do it.”\n\nBorn in Mexico, he’s lived in Chicago for years but doesn’t have citizenship.\n\nDHS touted Espinoza Martinez’s arrest on social media with unredacted photos of his face, referring to him as a “depraved” gang member. Bovino has held the case up as an example of the increasing dangers faced by federal agents. Prosecutors included Yonan, the second-highest ranking federal prosecutor in the Chicago region.\n\nBut several federal lawsuits in Chicago have fueled skepticism about DHS’s narratives. Of the roughly 30 criminal cases stemming from Operation Midway Blitz, charges have been dismissed or dropped in about half. In a notable lawsuit that forced Bovino to sit for depositions, a federal judge found he lied under oath including about alleged gang threats.\n\nBovino did not testify at Espinoza Martinez’s trial.\n\nNationwide, dozens of criminal cases tied to immigration operations have also crumbled.\n\nFederal prosecutors initially referred to Espinoza Martinez as a “ranking member” of the Latin Kings, but their lack of evidence led U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow to bar testimony on the Chicago street gang at trial. According to the criminal complaint, Espinoza Martinez allegedly sent messages on behalf of the gang to other gang members.\n\nAt trial, there were minor mentions of the gang, including Espinoza Martinez saying in his interview that he had nothing to do with the Latin Kings. His brother, Oscar, testified that he took the Snapchat messages as a joke and were something he’d already seen on Facebook.\n\nSinger poked holes in the government’s case, including in the testimony of their first witness Adrian Jimenez.\n\nThe 44-year-old owns a construction company and had been in touch with Espinoza Martinez over Snapchat about work. Unknown to Espinoza Martinez, he had also worked as a paid government informant over the years after serving a prison sentence for a felony. He shared the Snapchats with a federal investigator.\n\nJimenez, who suffers from back problems, walked slowly with a limp to the witness chair and needed help getting up.\n\n“Would you solicit for hire an individual that was in that much pain and could barely walk?” Singer said to jurors. “That doesn’t make any sense.”",

We want to keep our residents safe,\" the City Manager told reporters during a multi-departmental news conference. \"Our teams have been closely monitoring forecasts to ensure we activate our winter weather operations plan.\"\n\nTransportation and Public Works Director Gus Concarly said the city is taking a \"three-pronged approach,\" including pre-treating bridges and overpasses with brine and sand. Concarly noted that 50 \"ice force\" vehicles are standing by, but warned that residential streets will not be sanded unless requested by emergency responders.\n\nDallas Water Utilities urged residents to wrap exposed pipes and locate their main water shut-off valves. Meanwhile, sanitation officials warned that while Friday collections should proceed as scheduled, garbage and recycling pickups could see significant delays on Monday and Tuesday if road conditions deteriorate.\n\n\"We are well-prepared.

Ball also issued a stern warning regarding home heating safety.\n\n\"Don't start warming fires inside the house... no cooking on the balcony,\" Ball said, reminding residents to open fireplace drafts and avoid using candles or outdoor grills indoors if the power goes out.\n\nDallas Animal Services confirmed they will be patrolling 24/7 to respond to reports of animals left in the cold. Under city ordinances, pet owners are required to bring animals indoors during extreme weather.\n\nReflecting on the deadly 2021 winter storm, city leaders emphasized improved coordination and infrastructure. Officials noted that several recreation centers have since been equipped with emergency generators, allowing them to serve as warming stations where residents can charge phones and stay warm if local power grids fail.\n\n\"We have the systems in place to make sure those communication chains... are intact,\" the City Manager said. \"Planning for events like this does not start today.\"\n\nInformation in this article is from the Dallas city leader's news conference on Wednesday.",

    "description": "The weekend is creeping closer, and with it, a snowstorm that is projected to dump multiple inches of powder on the FOX 2 viewing area.",
    "fullText": "ST. LOUIS – The weekend is creeping closer, and with it, a snowstorm that is projected to dump multiple inches of powder on the FOX 2 viewing area.\n\nWith recent data, confidence is high that the vast majority of our viewing area will see at least four inches of snow, and some counties will see much more than that. Four inches will act as our starting baseline, while our worst-case scenario is closer to a foot of snow, perhaps more by the time the storm ends on Sunday.\n\nIt all depends how the system comes together Saturday evening.\n\nThe weekend system we’re tracking is actually two systems as of Thursday morning—one north of Alaska and the other sitting just off the California coast. We’re working to determine when both pockets of energy will merge, a very intricate process. Even small changes to the when and where or that merger can mess with the alignment of the temperature profile and where precipitation (snow) will form.\n\nThe presence of dry air in the viewing area will play a big role in snow intensity on Saturday, but will have a reduced influence that same evening.\n\nData now more strongly points to a two-wave system. The first wave arrives Saturday and could leave one to three inches of light snow. There will be a break or lull until the evening, when the precipitation becomes light and patchy. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising to see some frizzing drizzle or very fine sleet for several hours between the waves. Not because of the warm/dry air but rather the changing cloud physics between the two. The second wave arrives between 9 p.m. and midnight, with moderate to heavy snowfall into Sunday morning. Light snow may linger into the early afternoon before the system pulls away.\n\nHowever, with a two-wave system, the biggest snowfall totals will come in areas that “double dip” both waves. The greatest overlap is slated for areas along and southeast of Interstate 44 and south of metro St. Louis. We’re projecting six to 10 inches in those areas, centered on a line near Rolla through Park Hills/Farmington and then into Illinois along the Kaskaskia River.\n\nSt. Louis radar: See a map of current weather here\n\nThere could an even heavier band of eight to 12 inches of snow in the far southern viewing area for Reynolds, Iron, and Madison counties in southeast Missouri. The I-70 corridor will get a glancing blow from the first wave but could get the full brunt of the second wave. With more confidence in the track of wave 2, we’re looking at widespread totals of four to eight inches of accumulation across the metro area.\n\nWinds will not be extreme but they will get gusty, with speeds topping 20 to 25 miles per hour, which is going to result in drifting snow, particularly in open and rural areas.\n\nNew data is always rolling in. You can watch us on our smart TV app. FOX2STL+ or the FOX 2 mobile app via the Apple or Google app stores.",
