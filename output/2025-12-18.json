    "fullText": "The Patriots suffered a defeat against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, but their chances of securing the AFC East title remain promising.\n\nNew England still has three regular season games remaining, playing the Baltimore Ravens, New York Jets and Miami Dolphins.\n\nBrad Gagnon from Bleacher Report outlined the Patriots’ ideal scenario for the remainder of the regular season.\n\n“Beat the Ravens on the road in Week 16 to show some much-needed resiliency, then clinch the AFC East title by taking care of the division-rival Jets and/or Dolphins to close out the regular season,” Gagnon wrote on Wednesday.\n\nThe Patriots can secure a playoff spot with a win or a tie against the Ravens this Sunday. However, New England will need to wait for the outcome of the last two weeks, which will be determined by division opponents, to see if it can clinch the AFC East title.\n\nNew England currently has an 11-3 record, while Buffalo is at 10-4. If the Patriots win their remaining games, they will secure the AFC East title. However, after losing to Buffalo in Week 15, they lost the head-to-head tiebreaker, as the Patriots and Bills split their matchups this season.\n\nThe next tiebreaker is based on wins against division opponents. The Patriots have a 3-1 record, while the Bills are 3-2 following their loss to the Dolphins.\n\nEven if the Patriots lose to the Ravens but defeat the Jets and Dolphins, New England will still claim the AFC East title, even if the Bills win all their remaining games.\n\nPatriots-Ravens Injury Report: Lamar Jackson Among Starters Missing On Both Sides",

    "fullText": "The Boston Bruins added some more depth to their defensive unit on Tuesday.\n\nBoston claimed 24-year-old defenseman Vladislav Kolyachonok off waivers from the Dallas Stars. Kolyachonok had his first practice with the Bruins on Wednesday, and head coach Marco Sturm said the team added him as more depth.\n\n“That’s why we kind of picked him up,” Sturm said on Wednesday. “We needed some extra help, we are running really thin right now, and didn’t want to get in trouble, getting one injury away.\n\n“We felt like he will be a good addition to our D-group. (General manager Don Sweeney) and his staff were scouting him for the last little bit. Seems like a good kid.”\n\nKolyachonok has one goal and two assists in 11 games with the Stars. The left-shot defenseman will add depth to Boston’s blue line, but Sturm isn’t sure when he will make his Bruins’ debut.\n\n“He has a little bit of everything, I feel like he has a little bit of offense, he can defend,” Sturm said. “I think he played some PK as well. We look at him as a depth guy, and hopefully he is going to get a chance, too, I don’t know when.”\n\nKolyachonok, meanwhile, is just excited to be with Boston and will play whatever role is asked of him.\n\n“Whatever they tell me to do, I am going to do it,” Kolyachonok said.\n\nThe Bruins will return to the ice on Thursday at home against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nCharlie McAvoy Shouts Out Unsung Hero From Bruins’ Win Vs.

    "fullText": "Andriy Lunin emerged as one of Real Madrid’s decisive figures in the 3–2 win over Talavera, not only for his late heroics between the posts but also for his words afterward in the mixed zone. Wearing the captain’s armband on the night, the Ukrainian goalkeeper addressed the media.\n\n“Thanks to the half of the squad that wasn’t here, to all the captains — being captain of Real Madrid is always an honor. There’s a lot of hard work and time behind it, and I’m grateful to everyone who has helped me all this time.”\n\n“It was difficult to advance, it’s always difficult. The Cup is different, the matches are different and I would like to advance without conceding any goals, but we are already in the round of 16 and we have to keep fighting for the Cup.”\n\n“You have to understand that every coach is different. Ancelotti was older, more experienced, and had won everything in his career. Xabi is young, everyone respects him, there are new things going on, and it’s a normal process of adaptation and change.”\n\n“I don’t know who could doubt Xabi, we don’t doubt our coach. We’re a group and we’re all in the same boat. I don’t know who’s questioning him, whether it’s the fans or the press, but in the end it doesn’t matter to us because we’re focused on our job.”\n\n“We prepare for every match the same way. We are all aware here of what club we are at and what is at stake. We must win every match.\n\n“We had to be even more aggressive, focused, and not relax. We advanced, and that’s the most important thing.”\n\n“I don’t think that way. It’s my job, what I’ve been doing since I was little. I have to help the team and always be ready.”\n\n“We had to play a serious match and we did so to a certain point. The important thing was to get through the round and keep fighting.”",

    "description": "Follow the latest injury news for fantasy football lineups in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "Staying up to date on NFL injury news is of the utmost importance for fantasy football success. The article below tracks all fantasy-relevant players currently listed on their team's injury report, and provides fantasy managers with actionable recommendations as new information rolls in.\n\nCheck back for updates from Tuesday through Saturday.\n\n**UPDATED AS OF WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 17TH AT 7:25 PM ET**\n\nKincaid practiced fully through the knee injury last week. He was held out on Wednesday, to begin Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: It is possible he suffered a setback. Thursday and Friday's injury reports are worth following.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Bills signed kicker Michael Badgley to kick in Prater's stead. He is barely on the K1 radar.\n\nHill suffered a dislocated knee in the team's Week 4 win over the Jets. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Hill's absence likely places additional emphasis on the short-to-intermediate areas of the field, increasing the expected target volume for De'Von Achane, Darren Waller, and Jaylen Waddle.\n\nJennings will miss the rest of the regular season on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jennings is no longer a threat to steal short-yardage carries.\n\nHall is practicing fully for Week 16 against the Saints.\n\nFantasy Impact: He remains an RB2.\n\nTaylor has been ruled out for Week 16, missing his second consecutive game.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell should operate as the clear-cut No. 1 pass catcher.\n\nTaylor departed the team's Week 14 loss to the Dolphins with a groin injury and did not return. Taylor was sidelined on Wednesday and did not play in Week 15. He is competing with quarterback Justin Fields (knee) for the primary backup role.\n\nFields is rehabbing the knee injury while competing for the No. 2 job.\n\nWilson sprained his knee in his return to the active roster in Week 10 and is set to miss \"three-to-four weeks.\" He was placed on injured reserve and is eligible to return in Week 15. Head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters Monday that he did not have an update on Wilson's potential return from injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Whelp, Wilson's return didn't last long as he is now set to miss another chunk of time with an additional knee injury. The Jets again find themselves bereft of pass-catching talent. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor stands to benefit the most in a fantasy setting, although the Jets continue to be allergic to throwing the football. Head coach Aaron Glenn said last week that he expects Wilson to \"return this season.\"\n\nAllen suffered a \"pretty serious\" knee injury on a kickoff return in the second quarter of the team's Week 4 loss to the Dolphins. He is out indefinitely.\n\nFantasy Impact: Allen has been a significant contributor in the red zone this season. His absence substantially boosts Breece Hall's upside, who is now a locked-in RB1 in Week 5 against the Cowboys. Backup running back Isaiah Davis can be stashed in 12-team leagues as a high-upside contingency option. Hall gained a season-high 155 yards from scrimmage on 18 opportunities in his first game without Allen in Week 5.\n\nReynolds was evidently placed on injured reserve in Week 10, after suffering a hip injury during practice in Week 8.\n\nFantasy Impact: Reynolds' absence clears the way for new Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to be active on game day.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jackson has finished as a QB1 twice since Week 9. He faces the Patriots' capable defense in Week 16. He is a highly volatile, high-end QB2.\n\nHill will not play in Week 13. Head coach John Harbaugh said Monday that Hill could return \"in three to four weeks.\"\n\nFantasy Impact: Running back Keaton Mitchell will continue operating as the clear-cut No. 2 in Baltimore.\n\nHiggins missed Week 13 with a concussion. He was placed back into protocol following Week 14 after reporting symptoms after the game and did not play in Week 15. He remains limited at the beginning of Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: A second concussion in two calendar weeks is a significant issue for Higgins. Bengals tight end Mike Gesicki would benefit if Higgins misses time.\n\nNjoku aggravated his knee injury in Week 14. He was ruled out for Week 15 and remains sidelined in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: We expect rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. to continue operating as the team's No. 1 pass catcher. Start Fannin with confidence after a career game a week ago.\n\nSampson was sidelined by the calf injury in Week 15. He has not yet resumed practicing.\n\nFantasy Impact: Fellow rookie RB Quinshon Judkins earned four targets with Sampson out last week, tying his career-high. Judkins totaled minus-four yards on three receptions, though. He is an inefficient receiver.\n\nThe Browns signed running back Trayveon Williams after placing Ford on injured reserve this week.\n\nFantasy Impact: Williams is unlikely to contribute on game day, now occupying the No. 3 role. We expect No. 2 running back Dylan Sampson (calf/hand) to continue playing through injury.\n\nThe Steelers did not experience any fantasy-relevant injuries in their Week 15 win over the Dolphins.\n\nFantasy Football Defense (DST) Week 16 Rankings and Streamers\n\nEric Samulski breaks down his fantasy football defense rankings for Week 16 of the NFL season\n\nMarks was unable to finish the team's Week 15 win over the Cardinals due to an ankle injury. He did not practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach DeMeco Ryans told reporters Monday that Marks \"should be fine\" moving forward, and that he likely could have returned against the Cardinals.\n\nChubb was unable to finish the team's Week 14 win over the Chiefs due to a ribs injury and did not play in Week 15. He returned to practice in a limited capacity on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Chubb could handle double-digit touches if Marks is unable to play.\n\nMixon was placed on the Non-Football Injury list ahead of Week 1. He is not expected to play this year.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran Nick Chubb is now in a game script-dependent rushing role, while rookie running back Woody Marks operates as the starter.\n\nJones played through a fracture in his fibula for two-plus games before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 14. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury comes at the worst possible time for the sliding Colts, who have dropped from the two-seed to the fringes of playoff contention in three short weeks. Making matters worse, Riley Leonard suffered a knee injury in relief duties against the Jaguars. The Colts signed potential Hall of Fame candidate Philip Rivers, who is set to draw another start in Week 16.\n\nLeonard suffered a PCL sprain in Week 14. He is practicing fully.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran grandfather Philip Rivers was elevated from the practice squad to start in Week 15 against the Seahawks.\n\nRichardson suffered a \"freak accident\" ahead of Week 6 in which an elastic band snapped a piece of metal hit him in the eye, fracturing his orbital bone. He was placed on injured reserve. He was medically cleared to resume practicing on Monday, but he is not a candidate to start.\n\nFantasy Impact: Richardson was medically cleared to practice Monday but the team already named veteran Philip Rivers the starter for Week 16.\n\nTuten underwent successful surgery on his finger Monday and will miss the remainder of the season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Tuten's injury leaves Travis Etienne alone in the backfield, although the team signed journeyman DeeJay Dallas on Tuesday. Etienne carries clear league-winning upside in a likely robust role for the remainder of the season. Rookie running back LeQuint Allen can be stashed.\n\nHunter was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending LCL tear.\n\nFantasy Impact: See Thomas' section above.\n\nFantasy Impact: Helm should be good to go for TE2-worthy duties.\n\nRidley reportedly broke his fibula in Week 11 and is out for the season.\n\nFantasy Impact: It's a disappointing end to a disappointing season for the veteran receiver. The Titans are left with no standout fantasy options in his absence.\n\nBryant managed to suit up on Sunday after straining his hamstring in Week 14's Thursday practice session. He was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Bryant is back on the FLEX radar against the Jaguars.\n\nHarvey is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Harvey is a locked-in RB2 against the Jaguars.\n\nDobbins was ruled out on Friday before being placed on IR on Saturday. The injury requires surgery, likely ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie RJ Harvey is in line to see a noticeable increase to what has been a modest snap rate, although Tyler Badie remained frustratingly involved. Jaleel McLaughlin also saw increased opportunities on early downs.\n\nRice “reported concussion symptoms on Monday and entered the league’s protocol,” jeopardizing his availability against the Titans. He did not practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton is also in the NFL's concussion protocol. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce could handle a sizable workload in Week 16.\n\nMahomes suffered a season-ending ACL tear with an associated LCL tear in the Chiefs' Week 15 loss to the Chargers. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Mahomes underwent successful surgery Monday to repair both ligaments, thusly starting an estimated nine-month recovery timetable. Gardner Minshew will start for the Chiefs for the remainder of the season after the team was eliminated from postseason contention in Week 15.\n\nBrown was ruled out for Week 15 Friday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Although not a direct benefit to any singular player, both JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton have fewer bodies to compete with for rotational snaps.\n\nSmith missed the Raiders' Week 15 game against the Eagles after entering Week 14 with a foot injury and exiting with a throwing shoulder injury and significant abrasions on his throwing hand's ring and pinky fingers. Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said there is a \"good chance\" Smith will start in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Texans' elite defense can be safely expected to keep Smith in the low-end QB2 range this week.\n\nJohnston was added to the team's injury report on Friday with a groin issue and did not play in Week 15. He resumed practicing the following Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Johnston is back on the boom-bust FLEX radar against a wide receiver-friendly Cowboys defense.\n\nHarris ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg during the Chargers' Week 3 win over the Broncos. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal are likely to continue splitting backfield work until the former can work his way back into game shape.\n\n10 Fantasy Football Takeaways from Week 15: Kyle Pitts rises, Justin Jefferson falls\n\nOn the heels of a historic performance, Kyle Pitts is rising up the fantasy ranks ahead of Week 16. Justin Jefferson, on the other hand, is in freefall.\n\nWilliams injured his neck early in the Cowboys' Week 16 game against the Vikings. Although he missed snaps, including opportunities in the red zone, he did manage to play through it. He was limited on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Williams is a low-end RB1 against the Chargers.\n\nFantasy Impact: Ferguson was hampered by the injury last week. His return to full participation is a good sign.\n\nSanders was injured in Week 4 and did not play in Week 5. He was ruled out for Week 6 before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran Javonte Williams continues to operate in a near workhorse role.\n\nNabers suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 4 win over the Chargers and will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury could not have come at a worse time for the Giants after they moved to rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart under center. Nabers' absence will make it difficult to consistently move the football, lowering the upside of all remaining healthy players. Nabers makes for a solid trade target for dynasty managers looking to rebuild this season.\n\nSkattebo suffered a gruesome dislocated ankle in the team's Week 8 loss to the Eagles, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: The backfield in New York should revert to a timeshare headed by veteran Tyrone Tracy in Skattebo's absence. Devin Singletary remains on hand for change-of-pace duties. Treat Tracy as a low-end RB2 for the remainder of the season.\n\nBarkely resumed practicing on Wednesday after sitting out on Tuesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: It would be nice to see Barkley practice fully on Thursday. He is a borderline RB1/2 against the Commanders.\n\nDaniels dislocated the elbow in his left, non-throwing arm in the team's Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. He was ruled out for the remainder of the season Monday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Backup quarterback Marcus Mariota will start for the Commanders in the final three weeks of the regular season. He is a borderline QB1/2.\n\nRodriguez did not practice on Wednesday and did not play in Week 15. He is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt rushed 18 times for 96 yards and a touchdown with Rodriguez sidelined last week, which should return Croskey-Merritt to the starting role. This is worth following closely. Stay tuned.\n\nThe team placed Brown on injured reserve on Monday, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: None. Brown has not been fantasy-relevant all season.\n\nErtz suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 14 loss to the Vikings. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: The hits keep on coming for the Commanders in a lost season. John Bates should step into a significant role for the Commanders down the stretch but likely does not carry enough upside for weekly fantasy consideration.\n\nOdunze returned to practice on Wednesday and missing all of Week 14. He was removed from the injury report for Week 15 before missing the game after aggravating the injury in pre-game warmups. He has not yet resumed practicing.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Ben Johnson told reporters Monday that \"all options are on the table\" regarding Odunze's status moving forward. That does not inspire confidence that he will be available in the coming weeks.\n\nBurden injured his ankle in Week 15 and has been unable to practice since.\n\nFantasy Impact: Bears tight end Colston Loveland, and wide receivers DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus should receive notable target share bumps if Odunze and Burden are both sidelined. Tight end Cole Kmet (knee/ankle) was also limited on Wednesday.\n\nSwift was not on Tuesday's injury report. He was added to Wednesday's injury report as a limited participant, which could indicate that he aggravated the groin injury he dealt with earlier this year.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie running back Kyle Monangai would vault into the RB1 tier if Swift cannot face the Packers this week.\n\nWright landed hard on his neck in Week 12. He has been placed on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Backup tight ends Shane Zylstra (knee) and Ross Dwelley form a fantasy-unfriendly duo, who should only be considered in DFS lineups.\n\nLaPorta was added to the Lions’ injury report with a back injury on Wednesday. After being ruled out for Week 11 on Friday, the Lions placed him on injured reserve on Saturday.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Lions’ pass-catching corps is deep. Removing LaPorta from it could result in one or more extra targets for WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR Jameson Williams and RB Jahmyr Gibbs.\n\nJacobs reportedly aggravated his knee injury in the team's Week 15 loss to the Broncos. His knee also reportedly \"stiffened\" up in Week 14 against the Bears. Aggravations in consecutive games are concerning. He missed Week 16's first two practices.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Monday that Jacobs \"would not have practiced\" had the team held a regular session. He should continue to see his practice reps managed and could be in line to miss Week 16 against the Bears. No. 2 running back Emanuel Wilson must be rostered.\n\nWatson was unable to finish the team's Week 15 loss to the Broncos after landing hard on his shoulder on a Jordan Love interception in the third quarter. Watson told reporters that he \"should be good” to play in Week 16 against the Bears.\n\nFantasy Impact: Watson is a high-upside WR3.\n\nKraft suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the team's Week 9 loss to the Panthers.\n\nFantasy Impact: Kraft's breakout season comes to an end prematurely after the untimely knee injury. Luke Musgrave should be rostered in all formats as he likely enters a featured role for the Packers.\n\nWentz will undergo season-ending surgery after playing through a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum.\n\nFantasy Impact: Second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy is the starter in Minnesota moving forward.\n\nLondon reportedly suffered a PCL sprain in the team's Week 11 loss to the Panthers. Head coach Raheem Morris labeled London \"day-to-day\" in Week 15, but the team ultimately ruled him out. He returned to practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Tight end Kyle Pitts has operated as the passing game's top option with London sidelined. London's practice participation level should help us determine his expected involvement if he is cleared to play this week. Stay tuned.\n\nPenix reportedly suffered a knee injury that included a partially torn ACL, a separate sprain and a bone bruise in the team's Week 11 loss to the Panthers. He will undergo season-ending ACL reconstruction.\n\nFantasy Impact: That leaves the team in the hands of veteran Kirk Cousins moving forward. Cousins notably completed 21-of-31 passes for only 173 yards with no touchdowns in his only other start this season, which came against an underperforming Dolphins team. The Falcons could be in some trouble the rest of the way.\n\nMcMillan did not practice on Wednesday. The team hopes to get him back on Thursday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Panthers slot receiver Jalen Coker is playing very well. He would likely hog targets if McMillan cannot play this week.\n\nNeal departed the team's Week 15 win over the Panthers with a hamstring injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled him out for Week 16 against the Jets.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Saints promoted running back Evan Hull to the active roster in November. Running back Audric Estime was promoted to the active roster for last week's game. Neither player ran efficiently, but Estime was surprisingly used effectively via screen passes and checkdowns. Estime could be the starter this week.\n\nVele could not finish the team's Week 15 win over the Panthers due to a shoulder injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled Vele out for Week 16 against the Jets.\n\nFantasy Impact: Mason Tipton would be next in line for snaps at wide receiver alongside Chris Olave, should Vele be unable to go in Week 16. Olave became quarterback Tyler Shough's go-to receiver after Vele left early in Week 15.\n\nKamara remains sidelined by his ankle injury and PCL sprain. He has neither practiced nor played since Week 12 and was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He remains sidelined to begin Week 16.\n\nMiller suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 7 loss to the Bears. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie Devin Neal should step into the primary change-of-pace role for the Saints in Miller's absence. Lead back Alvin Kamara saw the highest snap rate since Week 2 following Miller's departure and could be again looking at a workhorse role moving forward.\n\nOtton is doubtful to play in Week 15 against the Falcons. He did not play. Otton was limited to begin Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Payne Durham is the next man up at tight end for the Buccaneers, although he remains unlikely to contribute in a meaningful way on Thursday Night Football.\n\nEvans was limited on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: This is likely just load management. Evans should be good to go for Week 16, without restrictions.\n\nHarrison picked up a heel injury in his return to the lineup following a two-game absence due to an appendectomy. He was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He has resumed practicing in a limited capacity.\n\nFantasy Impact: Wide receiver Michael Wilson has established himself as an elite fantasy starter in Harrison's absence. If Harrison returns, both players can be viewed as WR3s.\n\nThe Cardinals placed Knight on injured reserve Monday, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Michael Carter and Emari Demercado should split work in the backfield for the rest of the season.\n\nThe Cardinals placed Dortch on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Wide receiver Michael Wilson will continue earning targets voluminously.\n\nBenson underwent surgery after injuring his meniscus in Week 4. The Cardinals opened his 21-day practice window in Week 12, but they ultimately decided not to activate him from injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Running back Bam Knight is seemingly the best bet to operate as the Cardinals' rest-of-season starter.\n\nMurray injured his foot on a fourth-quarter fumble in Week 5. He was placed on injured reserve in Week 10 and will be eligible to return in Week 14 against the Rams, though it could be as the Cardinals' backup. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Monday that the team will not open his 21-day practice window this week.\n\nFantasy Impact: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has finished as a QB1 in his last three games. He remains a viable streamer.\n\nConner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3.\n\nFantasy Impact: See: Trey Benson.\n\nJones suffered a torn Achilles in the team's Week 10 loss to the Seahawks, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jones filled a situational role for the Cardinals but his absence could provide additional run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.\n\nAdams played through the hamstring strain without suffering a reported re-injury in Week 14. He aggravated the injury in the team's Week 15 win and was unable to finish the game. He is doubtful for Week 16 against the Seahawks on Thursday night.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Sean McVay told reporters Monday that Adams could be a game-time decision for Week 16. It would appear to be highly unlikely that Adams plays on a short week, potentially setting up an offensive game plan built around 13-personnel. Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua referred to wide receiver Konata Mumphield as Adams' \"apprentice.\" Mumphield could warrant boom-bust FLEX consideration, though he has no fantasy floor.\n\nHigbee was placed on injured reserve after suffering an ankle injury in the team's Week 11 win over the Seahawks.\n\nFantasy Impact: Higbee's absence for much of the game against the Seahawks simply allowed rookie Terrance Ferguson to step into additional snaps as opposed to forcing the team to move away from their league-leading 13-personnel rates. Colby Parkinson should be viewed as the team's starter. Davis Allen is capable as well. The Panthers struggle to cover opposing tight ends.\n\nPearsall injured both his knee and ankle in the team's Week 15 win.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters on Monday that \"there is concern\" about Pearsall's injuries. Missed time could force Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson into increased run.\n\nHead coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Aiyuk's 21-day practice window ahead of a Week 11 meeting with the Cardinals. The same was said for Week 12, and now Week 13. Reports then surfaced that Aiyuk and the 49ers are \"headed for divorce\" after the team voided his 2025 guarantees.\n\nFantasy Impact: A mostly lost season for Aiyuk appears to be quickly approaching, at least as far as fantasy is concerned.\n\nArroyo is \"out right now\" with a knee injury.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury allows tight end AJ Barner to assume a full-time role.\n\nHorton was added to the injury report Thursday with multiple ailments and did not play in Week 10 against the Cardinals. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Friday and remains sidelined early in Week 12. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.\n\nFantasy Impact: It's unfortunate timing for the blazing rookie after his breakout performance in Week 9.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers are still annoyed that they let Thursday night's game slip through their fingers.\n\nUp 28-14 in the fourth quarter against the Atlanta Falcons, the offense stumbled, and the defense couldn't get a stop as Kirk Cousins led a superb comeback that embarrassed the Buccaneers.\n\nWith plenty of blame to go around on both sides of the ball, with Todd Bowles' defense horrific, and Baker Mayfield and Co. unable to score enough points.\n\nFor Mike Evans, who marked his return to the team with a monster 132-yard game, does he think the unit has to score more than 28 points each week?\n\n“Absolutely,” Evans said. “As a offense, especially with the amount of talented players that we have, we're going to go out there and put up way more than that. Especially after we watch film and see how much meat we left on the bone, it's unacceptable for offense of this caliber.”\n\nMore:Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield has pointed message for Todd Bowles doubters\n\nYou could make that case, but every offense wants to score touchdowns on every single drive, but that isn't reality.\n\nIn truth, 28 points should have been more than enough for the Buccaneers to beat the Falcons, and as far as Evans saying 28 points is unacceptable for the offense, looking around the league, Tampa Bay should be happy with that.\n\nOnly six teams average 28 points or more per game.\n\nSo, it isn't an easy thing to do week in, week out, but that is the standard given the abundance of weapons on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nAt least we know the pass mark this week in Carolina for the Buccaneers -- score more than 28 points.\n\nBaker Mayfield shoulders blame for Buccaneers' collapse against Falcons\n\nBucky Irving's frustrating lack of usage near goal line explained by Bucs reporter\n\nTodd Bowles points finger after Bucs' loss to Falcons and it wasn't at the coaches\n\nBuccaneers vs. Falcons final score, results: Kirk Cousins, Falcons storm back from 14-point deficit to shock Buccaneers",

Albacete knocked out Celta on penalties, and Cultural Leonesa did it in regular time against Levante.\n\nOn the other hand, the great hero was Racing de Santander, who eliminated the third-placed team in LaLiga from the Copa del Rey. With these three eliminations, we now have eight top-tier teams knocked out.\n\nUndoubtedly, the season for the red and whites is more than irregular, and today they provided another example of it.\n\nCoudet's team stood up to Almeyda's and ended up eliminating them from the Copa del Rey thanks to Vicente's goal from the penalty spot.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears released an open letter to fans Wednesday night that said the franchise is considering Northwest Indiana as a location for a new stadium.\n\nThe team has been seeking tax breaks and nearly $900 million in public funding, according to media reports, to build a stadium in Cook County, the most recent target being Arlington Heights, a Chicago suburb. But Bears President and CFO Kevin Warren said in the letter the team is not receiving a \"sense of urgency or appreciation to date\" from the state.\n\n\"We have been told directly by state leadership our project will not be a priority in 2026,\" Warren said. “Consequently, in addition to Arlington Park, we need to expand our search and critically evaluate opportunities throughout the wider Chicagoland region, including Northwest Indiana.\n\n“This is not about leverage. We spent years trying to build a new home in Cook County. ... Our fans deserve a world-class stadium. Our players and coaches deserve a venue that matches the championship standard they strive for every day. With that in mind, our organization must keep every credible pathway open to deliver that future.\"\n\nGov. JB Pritzker didn't hold back in his response Warren offering Indiana as an option for the Bears.\n\n“Suggesting the Bears would move to Indiana is a startling slap in the face to all the beloved and loyal fans who have been rallying around the team during this strong season,” a Pritzker spokesman said in a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times. “The Governor’s a Bears fan who has always wanted them to stay in Chicago. He has also said that ultimately they are a private business that makes their own decisions, but the Governor has also been clear that the bottom line for any private business development should not come at the full expense of taxpayers.”\n\nIn a letter to season-ticket holders, #Bears president/CEO Kevin Warren says Illinois state leadership told the team its proposed stadium in Arlington Heights won’t be a priority in 2026. \n\nWarren says, consequently, the team will expand its search, including Northwest Indiana. pic.twitter.com/EWTEsriRSv\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) December 17, 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Chicago Bears moving: Team considering Northwest Indiana for stadium",

    "description": "Jarred Vanderbilt sparked the Lakers' defensive effort in the win over Phoenix on Sunday, but they'll need their stars to contribute as well against Utah.",
    "fullText": "They saw how “contagious” it was when playing defense at a high level against the Suns and how Jarred Vanderbilt lit the fuse to ignite things for the Lakers in their last victory over Phoenix.\n\nAnd for the Lakers to maintain that defensive mindset, stars Luka Doncic and LeBron James also have to be committed to that end of the court.\n\nThat was the message from Lakers coach JJ Redick to Doncic and James.\n\n\"Yeah, it was good,\" Doncic said. \"We talked about a lot, not just that, but he was right. You got to get a little big more, especially from the star players. So that's on us. That's on me. And we just got to give more, especially at the start of the game. We got to start the game better. But I think in Phoenix, we did a pretty good job. The plan was focused on ourselves and [our] defensive mentality, so I think we did a pretty good job.\"\n\nThe Lakers will be tested again on defense by the Utah Jazz Thursday night in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Jazz have a developing star in Lauri Markkanen, a difficult matchup at 7-foot-1 who is ninth in the NBA in scoring at 27.8 points per game, and a young talent in guard Keyonte George, who is averaging 23.5 points and 6.8 assists.\n\nUtah is fourth in the league in pace (102.98), ninth in scoring (119.0), second in assists (29.8). The Jazz are fifth in rebounds (45.7), eighth in offensive rebounds (12.6), and 12th in field-goal percentage.\n\n\"The way we play, we got to approach every game the same,\" Doncic said. \"In the NBA, every team is dangerous, so at some point somebody can go for 40. They have Markkanen, and then George. They can go for 40 on any night. So we just got to work on ourselves and approach the game, make everything the same.\"\n\nThe all-out energy and effort by Vanderbilt off the bench was the catalyst for the Lakers against the Suns.\n\nIn his 15 minutes of action, he had seven ponits, seven rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot.\n\nVanderbilt had played only three minutes and eight seconds over a 10-game stretch prior to that point.\n\n“Vando's minutes were huge,” Gabe Vincent said. “He came in and does what we all know he's very capable of doing and being disruptive on the defensive end, crashing the glass, getting extra possessions for us, all of which we desperately needed. You know what I mean? So his spark off the bench was huge for us.\"\n\nNow it’s about sustaining that defensive intensity, the Lakers say. And about playing with that physicality, the Lakers say.\n\n“Yeah, when you guys asked me this the last time, it’s effort,” Jake LaRavia said. “If we just go out there and we give that kind of effort every night…We got a lot of guys on the team. Some guys might not be having it and, like you said about that contagious word, that really helps out. (Marcus) Smart does it sometimes. Vando does it sometimes. I would say I do it just being a contagious type of person to help lead the team and just being extra physical.”\n\nThe Lakers are ranked near the bottom of the league in some defensive categories, which means there remains room for improvement.\n\nThey are ranked 17th in the league in points allowed (116.7), 24th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) allowed and 28th in three-point shooting (38.1%) allowed.\n\n“You just got to go out there and do it,” LaRavia said. “It’s not anything a coach can say. It’s not anything a player can tell another player. Yeah, it’s like the individual player’s job to go out there and give effort on defense and that’s contagious. It just goes around.”\n\nLakers center Deandre Ayton on Wednesday was named by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Assn. as the winner of the Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for November. Ayton was recognized for his philanthropic work across the Bahamas, which is his home country, Jamaica and Los Angeles through the Ayton Family Foundation.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Scarlet Knights across a wide variety of fall and winter sports earned recognition this past week, headlined by national podium finishes, conference and national honors, and academic acknowledgements. This includes preseason, midseason, and postseason awards, watch lists, and national medals.\n\nRutgers divers Bailee Sturgill and Katerina Hoffman had a standout showing at the 2025 USA Diving Winter Nationals, teaming up to earn a silver medal in the synchronized platform event with a second-place score of 488.91. Additionally, Sturgill added a second silver medal on synchronized 3M, as she teamed up with Lilly Witte of Indiana. The duo had a final score of 528.12, trailing the winning duo by roughly 31 points.\n\nSturgill and Witte won the synchronized 3M event in May during the USA Diving Nationals, but were unable to go back-to-back. Sturgill also competed on the 3M dive, while Hoffman also competed in the 1M and 3M events.\n\nSturgill was previously named the Big Ten Diver of the Week after winning the 3M dive against Princeton in November. She currently holds a spot on Rutgers’ all-time top-10 list in the 1M, 3M, and platform dive.\n\nAt the 2025 Winter Junior Nationals, Emilana Gonzalez finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle at the East Regionals on the campus of Indiana University. She posted a time of 22.40, which was the second-fastest time in Rutgers program history. Several other Rutgers signees competed at the US Junior Nationals, as the Scarlet Knights recently announced a talented eight-person class.\n\nStar running back Antwan Raymond picked up a major college football award, winning the Cornish Trophy as the most outstanding Canadian player in NCAA football. He was also named a semifinalist for the Doak Walker National Running Back Award. Safety Jett Elad was also named as one of the five finalists for the award.\n\nRutgers football previously earned key All-Big Ten honors as star wideout KJ Duff and Raymond were selected Second Team All-Big Ten by both coaches and media. In addition, OL Kwabena Asamoah, WR Ian Strong, and DB Bo Mascoe were selected as Big Ten Honorable Mentions by coaches and media.\n\nElad and placekicker Jai Patel were selected by conference coaches as Big Ten Honorable Mentions, while the media selected punter Jakob Anderson and linebacker Dariel Djabome for the same honors. Offensive lineman Gus Zilinskas was also given the Big Ten Sportsmanship Award.\n\nRutgers star defender Puck Winter was named a 2025 Second Team All-American by the NFHCA yesterday after recording 31 defensive saves as a four-year starter for the Scarlet Knights. She scored 17 career goals with four assists for 38 points, with five goals, three assists, and six defensive saves in 2025, ranking second in the Big Ten and fifth nationally. Winter was also previously named the National Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nEarlier this offseason, Puck Winter and captain Paulina Niklaus were also named First Team All-Mid-Atlantic Region, First Team All-Big Ten, and First Team All-ECAC. Olivia de Zwaan, Emily Nicholls, and Martha Goodridge won Freshman of the Week during the season, with Nicholls and Winter also earning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nGraduate student Emily Leese and senior Gabrielle Dildy were each named Big Ten Gymnasts to watch by the conference on Tuesday.

When asked for his prediction, Paul kept it bold and simple: \"It’s going to be the biggest upset in sports history.\"\n\nPaul doubled down on his prediction, comparing his impending victory to the monumental Giants-Patriots Super Bowl upset of 2007 and dramatically calling the event \"the Boston Tea Party 2.0.\" As always, he was not afraid to say what was on his mind, providing some soundbite-worthy moments throughout the night.\n\nMeanwhile, the veteran Joshua— stepping back into the ring after a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois— remained composed, focusing on his professional approach.The tension was palpable when Joshua's viral quote, \"If I can kill him, I’ll kill him,\" was brought up; he had an icy calm response, stating simply, \"It’s my job.\"\n\nFinally, as the two faced off, it was exactly what fans came to expect: a smaller, confident Paul against a silent former heavyweight champion of the world. Soon enough, the two will decide it in the ring.\n\nThe Sporting News followed all the action from Wednesday night’s press conference.

The Crusaders took down four-time defending state champions Chaminade-Madonna (Hollywood) in a 17-14 victory.\n\nThe leader of the Newman defense was three-star LB Adam Balogoun-Ali, who ended his high school career in the best possible way.\n\n“There’s no better way to end it,” Balogoun-Ali said after the win. “It’s not even a bittersweet feeling—just pure joy. I love my guys. I’m so glad we could get this done.”\n\nChaminade was the favorite going into the game, but Newman proved that any team can win on any given day.\n\n“It’s just a jersey. It’s just a name. They’re not the same team that they were. We knew if we came in and punched them in the mouth, we could win this game, and that’s what happened.”\n\nThe Benjamin School transfer feels he’s grown exponentially in his senior year at Newman and credits head coach Jack Daniels with instilling a culture that laid the foundation for the school’s first state championship.\n\n“This is a more complicated defense. I would say the biggest thing I learned was how to take in all the info really fast, especially when [offenses] are going quickly, as Chaminade did. I think learning the [college] playbook will be much easier now that I’ve come to Newman this year.\n\n“Coach Jack Daniels ‘ culture that he set at Cardinal Newman is superb. It’s unlike anything I’ve been a part of, and I’m really glad could learn from it.”\n\nAhead of the state title game, the Auburn signee received some motivational words from the newly formed Tiger staff.\n\n“The whole staff has been really supportive. They were telling me it’s just another game and to do me.”\n\nAuburn defensive coordinator DJ Durkin, who was instrumental in landing Balogoun-Ali’s signing, was retained by the program, much to the delight of the Tiger signee.\n\n“This is why I went to Auburn. I want to be coached by him. I really believe in what he does development-wise and scheme-wise. I think we are going to do great things over there at Auburn.”\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 210-pound backer is confident with his signing with Auburn and believes in what new head coach Alex Golesh is building on the Plains.\n\n“There was a lot of doubt about where people were going and all that, but personally, with me, I’m excited. I think it’s going to be a good time. With Coach Golesh as our new head coach, I think our offense will get going a lot, and our defense is already elite. I think in one or two years we’ll be a top team.”",

    "fullText": "Washington running back Adam Mohammed plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, On3 has learned. He ran for 523 yards this season.\n\nMohammed spent the last two seasons in Seattle and took on a larger role in 2025. He took 106 carries for 523 yards and five touchdowns as a sophomore and had 17 receptions for 138 yards in the passing game.\n\nAs a freshman in 2024, Adam Mohammed ran for 193 yards while adding 41 receiving yards. A product of Glendale (Ariz.) Apollo, he will have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nWashington put together a strong second season under Jedd Fisch in 2025, completing a 9-4 campaign with a victory over Boise State in the LA Bowl last week. Quarterback Demond Williams shined in his first year as the full-time starter, completing 69.5% of his passes for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns, to eight interceptions. He also added 611 rush yards and six touchdowns on the ground.\n\nAfterward, Fisch discussed the importance of keeping core players in tact as he gets ready for Year 3. He said the goal is to maintain as much continuity as possible on the roster, and he specifically pointed to Williams’ importance given the way he played throughout the year.\n\n“I thought, if you look at Raiden Vines probably had his first touchdown, he’s a freshman,” Fisch said in his LA Bowl press conference. “Dezmen Roebuck back had his seventh touchdown of the season. He’s a freshman. Demond played elite. He’s a sophomore. We play with probably the most freshmen in all of college football. Plays that were being made by guys were all young players. Players for the most part that all have eligibility left.\n\n“Our goal obviously is to bring back as many players as we possibly can. I think our guys know that we’ve got a great season coming ahead of us. We’ve got a great team. They’re led by an elite player. When you have an elite quarterback, you’ve got a great opportunity to win a lot of games.”",

    "fullText": "Venezuela’s government has ordered its Navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, escalating the risk of a confrontation with the United States after President Trump ordered a “blockade” aimed at the country’s oil industry.\n\nSeveral ships sailed from the country’s east coast with a naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, according to three people familiar with the matter. The vessels departed just hours after Mr. Trump said he intended to blockade sanctioned oil tankers that do business with Venezuela.\n\nThe ships — transporting urea, petroleum coke and other oil-based products — left the Port of José bound for Asian markets, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The Venezuelan government imposed the military escort in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, they said.\n\nVessels traveling with the escort did not appear on a current list of U.S. sanctioned ships, making it unclear whether they could be subject to Mr. Trump’s blockade. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he was focused on oil tankers that have violated U.S. trade sanctions.\n\nThe third person familiar with the matter, a U.S. official, said Washington was aware of escorts and was considering various courses of action, but declined to provide details.\n\nVenezuela’s state oil company, known as PDVSA, said in a statement on Wednesday that ships connected to its operations were continuing to sail “with full security, technical support and operational guarantees in legitimate exercise of their right to free navigation.”\n\nMr. Trump had announced on Tuesday evening that he was imposing a “total and complete blockade” of tankers to and from Venezuela that had violated U.S. trade sanctions. Roughly 40 percent of the tankers that have transported Venezuelan crude in recent years have been placed under U.S. sanctions, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials last week seized an Asia-bound sanctioned tanker carrying nearly two million barrels of Venezuelan crude, a major escalation of Mr. Trump’s standoff with Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, whose government derives the bulk of its revenues from oil exports.\n\nU.S. officials have said in private in recent days that additional tankers carrying Venezuelan oil may be seized, without providing additional details.\n\nMr. Maduro has reacted to the seizure with anger and vowed to keep the oil exports flowing at all cost, said one of the three people.\n\nNicholas Nehamas and Rebecca F.

    "title": "Trump Administration Aims to Strip More Foreign-Born Americans of Citizenship",
    "description": "An official with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would prioritize “those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration plans to ramp up efforts to strip some naturalized Americans of their citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times, marking an aggressive new phase in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe guidance, issued on Tuesday to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, asks that they “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year. If the cases are successful, it would represent a massive escalation of denaturalization in the modern era, experts said. By comparison, between 2017 and this year to date, there had been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department.\n\nUnder federal law, people may be denaturalized only if they committed fraud while applying for citizenship, or in a few other narrow circumstances. But the Trump administration has shown a zeal for using every tool at its disposal to target legal and illegal immigrants, leading activists to warn that such a campaign could sweep up people who had made honest mistakes on their citizenship paperwork and sow fear among law-abiding Americans.\n\nThe guidance comes as Mr. Trump has spent much of this year closing loopholes in the immigration system and throwing up roadblocks for people seeking to enter and stay in the country. The sweeping campaign, which has gone further than purging the country of unlawful migrants, has included blocks on asylum at the southern border, a pause on asylum applications inside the United States, and a ban on entry for travelers from predominantly African and Middle Eastern nations. Officials say their actions will make the country safer and preserve the country’s values\n\nA targeted campaign to increase the number of American immigrants stripped of their citizenship represents an escalation of an already ambitious campaign.\n\n“It’s no secret that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ war on fraud includes prioritizing those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship — especially under the previous administration,” said Matthew J. Tragesser, a U.S.C.I.S. spokesman. “We will pursue denaturalization proceedings for those individuals lying or misrepresenting themselves during the naturalization process. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”\n\nIn interviews, some former agency officials expressed concern at the scale of the case goals for denaturalization pushed by U.S.C.I.S. leadership.\n\n“Imposing arbitrary numerical targets on denaturalization cases risks politicizing citizenship revocation,” said Sarah Pierce, a former U.S.C.I.S. official. “And requiring monthly quotas that are 10 times higher than the total annual number of denaturalizations in recent years turns a serious and rare tool into a blunt instrument and fuels unnecessary fear and uncertainty for the millions of naturalized Americans.”\n\nProponents of stricter immigration laws said it was necessary to more aggressively root out people who had been improperly granted citizenship.\n\n“I don’t think we’re anywhere close to denaturalizing too many people,” said Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors restrictive immigration policies. Mr. Krikorian said that the country was “so far from denaturalizing” enough people that such an effort would not pull in people who should not be targeted.\n\nThere are about 26 million naturalized Americans in the country, according to the Census Bureau. More than 800,000 new citizens were sworn in last year, most of whom were born in Mexico, India, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic or Vietnam, U.S.C.I.S. statistics show. Most people stripped of their citizenship revert to being legal permanent residents.\n\nThe new guidance on Tuesday was part of a document laying out U.S.C.I.S. priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October. Listed alongside such goals as “provide employee feedback opportunities” and “strengthen management of high-risk cases” was “pursue denaturalization.”\n\nThe Justice Department previously also said it would make denaturalization a priority this year. In a memo distributed in the summer, officials laid out their approach, saying they would target individuals in an array of categories beyond committing fraud in obtaining citizenship. Categories of eligible people include gang members, those who committed financial fraud, individuals connected to drug cartels and violent criminals, according to the department.\n\n“The civil division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,” the agency wrote in June.\n\nU.S.C.I.S. is a key player in the process of denaturalization. The agency refers cases to the Justice Department, which must go through a federal court to strip someone of their citizenship. The process can occur either through a civil or a criminal proceeding. During a civil case, government lawyers must have “unequivocal evidence” that someone obtained citizenship illegally or hid a material fact during the process.\n\nBecause the government must go through a challenging court process, denaturalization cases have been rare since the 1990s. A Bloomberg Law analysis found that denaturalization cases brought by the government since then peaked in 2018, when 90 criminal and civil cases were filed. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that citizenship and naturalization are too precious and fundamental to our democracy for the government to take it away on their whim. Instead of wasting resources digging through Americans’ files, U.S.C.I.S. should do its job of processing applications, as Congress mandated,” said Amanda Baran, a former senior U.S.C.I.S. official in the Biden administration.\n\nMr. Trump stepped up denaturalizations in his first term as well. In one widely publicized case, a New Jersey man born in India, Baljinder Singh, was stripped of his citizenship after the Justice Department found that he had arrived in the country without travel documents or proof of identity and that he had used a different name.\n\nThis year, the Justice Department has brought 13 denaturalization cases and won eight of them, according to Chad Gilmartin, an agency spokesman. Mr. Gilmartin said in a social media post earlier this year that there had been over 100 cases filed to the courts during the first Trump administration, compared with 24 during the Biden administration. In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must prove not only that someone had lied during the citizenship application process but that the lie had an impact on the underlying citizenship claim.\n\nExperts said that despite the ramp-up in referrals, the process to actually denaturalize someone would likely remain quite difficult, raising questions on whether the government will actually be able to get many cases through.\n\nStill, some had concerns about what the guidance could portend.\n\n“My fear would be that as we have seen in the arrest and removal context when D.H.S. employees are given arbitrary targets what happens is people who shouldn’t be swept up, get swept up and that you’re going to see that happening to people in this context as well,” said Margy O’Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy organization. “That could incite fear and terror amongst naturalized citizens.”",

    "fullText": "How can you possibly squeeze a 32-bit PlayStation CD ROM game into a small Game Boy Color Cartridge? Well, HotGen would attempt to do just that with a conversion of Resident Evil in mid-1999 and to make it as close as possible with similar 3D perspectives using scaled sprites.\n\nThere were delays and a lot of struggles to cram everything in. There were of course a number of restrictions and tweaks made along the way, but HotGen had a pretty decent stab at it and had a title which was certainly pushing the 8-bit hardware.\n\nRetained were the original game’s locations, viewpoints, puzzles, pre-rendered backgrounds and dialogue. Characters and enemies were software-scaled, with technical compromises required due to the GBC’s limited CPU power and storage. Speech was replaced with text windows, but the structure of the PlayStation original remained largely intact.\n\nWhen we spoke to developer Nigel Speight as part of our book coverage in 2020, he had the following recollections about the development:\n\n“If I remember correctly I would say the game was about 75-85% complete. Originally the game was supposed to be about 35% of the original PlayStation version and we were going to elongate the storyline to keep reusing the rooms. However, as time went along Virgin kept upping the cartridge size and wanting more of the original content in. If I remember correctly I’d created an editor that allowed the 3d to be aligned to the screens and objects placed etc and I think that the last build we made didn’t include the final amount of content me and the artist Martin Smith had created.”\n\nThe game had been shown at places like E3 in 1999, and had been planned for release by the Christmas of that year – though delays meant it slipped into early 2000. By February 2000, the game was nearing completion and was being tested. However, Capcom decided to cancel the title, feeling that the game wasn’t up to scratch.\n\nAssistant programmer Pete Frith (back in 2020 when questioned by us) couldn’t recall the completion state, but felt it was more 98% finished, as there was a lot of communications between the team and QA testers at the end. He also recalls that the story they were told regarding the cancellation, was that the original creator of Resident Evil didn’t feel the GBC was worthy of his creation, and that he had personally instructed the cancellation. He also informed that the lead artist Martin Smith had sadly passed away.\n\nWhere Martin focused on the backgrounds, Simon Butler did the sprite work on the game. Mark Cooksey was then on hand to create all the music and sound effects, though many would not get properly integrated it seems.\n\nThankfully, in 2011 – two separate builds were preserved thanks to Kiff Storey and Bowker. One version was quite near to completion, but was missing intro titles and had debug screens on and was felt to be around 90% complete. A long-play online confirmed that the game wasn’t completable either for both characters.\n\nIn late 2025 however, Games That Weren’t have now preserved a final version of game at the point of cancellation and we have it here for you today to check out thanks to Pete Frith providing everything. Again, it isn’t 100% complete (perhaps now 98% – based on Pete’s estimates) – but there is more content and it *might* actually now be completable. Due to time constraints, we’ve not been able to sit and play through the title fully to confirm, as there might be scenes that glitch/bug out – if you find that it is, please do let us know!\n\nCrucially, we know that the Tyrant seems to be present at the end (see below) and its possible to trigger the end sequence compared to the earlier builds. We have a hack further below that jumps you near the end, so that you can see this for yourself.\n\nThe debug data present in other builds has been removed in the final build, and there are a set of introduction credit screens present in this version. Also, hacking through the game – the end sequences are in place too, which gives promise that the game may be completable in its current final state. Just in case it isn’t, we’ve created a few hacks which allow the following to unlock some unseen content:\n\n1) ResiEvilHack-EndingSelector: This allows you to just select either character and jump straight to the end sequences for both.\n\n2) ResiEvilHack-TyrantSegments: This hack jumps near towards the end of the game, where the tyrant is now walking around the final outside scene if you select Chris Redfield. If you select Jill Valentine, it starts you in the lab with the tyrant moving around (though its just their silloette).\n\nYou can’t seem to kill the Tyrant with the knife with Chris (though you might be able to find a weapon nearby). However, if you play with Jill and navigate towards the outside helicopter pad – the tyrant is there, and you can use your gun to kill them – triggering the end sequence.\n\n3) ResiEvilHack-SceneNMusicPlayer: This is quite a cool hack. Firstly, if you select either character – it will play through all the animated scenes for that player in sequence. It is likely there will be a few scenes here which were not used in the game or integrated. Then if you press “B” on the same selector screen, you will be able to play through all the SFX and pressing “SELECT” will cycle through all the tunes created by Mark Cooksey.\n\nIn a note found to the developers, Mark listed all the music and SFX as follows (with his original descriptions):\n\n0 Silence tune (Skipped in selector)\n 1 Long Background tune #1\n 2 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #1\n 3 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #2 *modified tune *\n 4 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #3 *new tune to replace old one *\n 5 Short Dramatic danger loop tune #4 * modified tune *\n 6 BG00 from res evil\n 7 Long Background tune #2\n 8 Long Background tune #3\n 9 Moonlight sonata correct\n 10 Moonlight sonata played badly correct\n 11 Long background tune #4\n 12 Girly end of game tune * new tune *\n\n0 Police card (char) select\n 1 Option move from one to another\n 2 select (highlight option)\n 3 Cancel\n 4 Wooden door open\n 5 Wooden door close\n 6 clock ticking VERSION 1 Looping\n 7 Stop clock 1 ticking\n 8 clock ticking VERSION 2 BETTER THAN 1 Lp\n 9 Stop clock 2 ticking\n 10 Footstep #1 on carpet\n 11 Single hard footstep\n 12 Double footstep #1 Gravel use together\n 13 Double footstep #2 left foot then RFoot\n 14 Long Footstep for wading through water\n 15 Gun shot #1 n\n 16 Gun shot #2\n 17 Knife swipe 1 Shorter\n 18 Knife swipe 2 Longer\n 19 Zombie Moan 1 (1 channel fx)\n 20 Zombie Moan 2 (2 channel fx more real)\n 21 Zombie Chomp (bite)\n 22 Teleprinter type sound 1 shot\n 23 Go on to next screen after pick char\n 24 Page Turn\n 25 Gun Reload 1 REVOLVER\n 26 Gun reload 2 Shotgun\n 27 Gun Reload 3 ???\n 28 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 29 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 30 Bloke Aaah being attacked.\n 31 Girl Aaah being attacked.\n 32 Push Furniture (continuous)\n 33 Stop push furniture\n 34 Bees\n 35 Break stone\n 36 Gate Noise\n 37 Lift start (loops)\n 38 Lift stop\n 39 Key open (key apar)\n 40 Power on\n 41 Computer key click\n\nIn addition to this, we have extracted out a set of assets used for the game – which may contain sprites/sequences not used in the final game. Also, the original WAV samples that Pete Frith created from his voice to make the speech on the title screen – including some versions that were not used :)\n\nWhat else have we established so far?\n\nIf you spot anything else – please feel free to get in touch or leave something in the comments and we’ll update the page over time. For now, we hope you enjoy taking a look at what has been recovered and enjoy the findings so far. We have also included two bonus builds that we also located which will have some minor differences too.\n\nWith a huge thank you to Pete Frith for allowing us to preserve and for the assets and to Nigel Speight for his recollections.",

    "fullText": "As a developer, a version control system is a critical part of your toolkit, no matter the size of the project or team you may find yourself working on.\n\nI first started learning to use git by applying it to my own projects and maintaining local repositories to track those projects. From there I moved on to hosting and storing my git repositories at Bitbucket while still working independently. My first experience with working alongside other developers in git came at my first full time development job on a small team (think tiny — two developers, myself included). I picked up the basics of branching, handling merges, developing different features in parallel and, ultimately, dealing with QA and production deployments that were sourced from various branches in our project repository.\n\nI've expanded on my knowledge git in the jobs I've held since that first position and have used svn pretty heavily as well (I don't mind it, but I don't love it — I'd argue git is the better choice for a number of reasons, its decentralized nature and flexibility being chief among them).\n\nOne of the many appeals of git is its flexibility and there are a wide range of commands that come with it. To get started, I'd suggest digging in with the following:\n\nEach of these commands has numerous options associated with it and allows for broad control over the flow and history of your project. There are a number of other options I'd suggest for learning more about git:",

    "fullText": "Creators and publishers have long worried about Meta's ability to throttle links to outside content. Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.\n\nUnder the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot shared by social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that \"certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using \"professional mode\" on Facebook. Publishers aren't affected for now. \"This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhile Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it's a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which starts at $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular.\n\nHave a tip for Karissa?

    "description": "UCLA study finds gut microbes are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.",
    "fullText": "Gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, UCLA evolutionary biologists report in a new study. The researchers found that gene variants that help microbes digest starches found in ultra-processed foods have “swept” the genomes of some species of gut bacteria in industrialized parts of the world. Because these starches are industrially produced and have only been around for a few decades, scientists believe natural selection must have been acting strongly to make these genes dominant so quickly. What’s more, the researchers have discovered that bacteria are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.\n\nThe study’s findings, published in Nature, scanned the genomes of almost three dozen species of gut bacteria using data from around the world and identified a process called horizontal gene transfer, in which bacteria transfer DNA from one strain to another, as the mechanism for this rapid evolution. Horizontal gene transfer has previously been identified as the mechanism that allows bacteria to evolve antibiotic resistance so quickly, but the prevalence of this process in gut microbes has been relatively unknown until now.\n\n“The discovery that the ability to digest novel starches is a target of natural selection in gut bacteria is interesting, but we found an even more robust, stronger signal that there are different targets of selection across many genes and many species in industrialized and non-industrialized populations,” said UCLA doctoral student and paper first author Richard Wolff. “What are the gut microbiomes in industrialized populations responding to? We’ve picked out one example with these starches, but there’s likely many possibilities we haven’t grappled with yet.”\n\nWolff and corresponding author, UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Nandita Garud, developed a novel statistic that identifies locations in the DNA of 30 gut bacteria species where genes have risen to high frequency, or “swept,” in that species. The statistic looks for tiny regions of homogeneity against a backdrop of immense diversity separating different strains of the same species.\n\n“Different strains of E. coli, for example, have diverged from each other as much as humans have diverged from chimps, yet we call them the same species. Despite this diversity, there are still shared fragments of DNA present in many hosts — a hidden thread connecting our microbiomes,” said Garud.\n\nDifferent genes appeared to be selected for in industrialized and non-industrialized populations, and one gene in particular was sweeping only in industrialized populations. That gene is associated with the ability to digest maltodextrin, which is made from cornstarch and has been used in processed foods since the 1960s.\n\n“We saw the adaptive signal very strongly, but we can’t say for sure yet if it’s specializing in maltodextrin or a broader class of starch derivatives. There might be intermediate steps as the bacteria adapt to different starch sources,” said Wolff. “There are a lot of steps in between eating a diet full of cassava and breadfruit and a diet full of Hot Cheetos or something like that.”\n\nBacteria can take up DNA from their environment in many different ways: They can eat it; they can be infected by a virus that carries DNA between them; and it can be transmitted when bacteria clump together and form a bridge that allows them to move between each other.\n\nBut humans have only a few strains of the same species of gut bacteria, and these strains typically stay with each person for many years. So the pervasiveness of the newly discovered adaptation raises the question: How do DNA fragments become shared between individual humans?\n\n“Each person might have a couple of different strains of E. coli,” said Garud. “If fragments of DNA are transmitted horizontally across different strains in different hosts, and these strains seemingly are faithful to their respective hosts, where do they recombine? How do they move between individual people to become fixed in a whole population?”\n\nWhile the answer will emerge with future research, the discovery that gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, and the possibility that novel starches may be exerting strong evolutionary pressure on them, suggest that careful attention to what we eat could play a more varied role in promoting good health than we think.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.",

    "title": "Is Cognitive Dissonance Actually a Thing?",
    "description": "A foundational 1956 study of the concept, focussed on a U.F.O. doomsday cult, has been all but debunked by new research.",
    "fullText": "Festinger was developing the now ubiquitous theory of cognitive dissonance. He argued that, when people encounter contradictions, they experience so much discomfort that they feel an urgent need to reduce it. In response, a person can update his views—or he can misinterpret, and even reject, whatever information has challenged his beliefs. He might seek out people who agree with him; he might try to persuade those who don’t. “A man with a conviction is a hard man to change,” Festinger later wrote. “Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.” Cognitive dissonance helped explain human choices that otherwise seemed irrational, stubborn, and shortsighted: these were, in fact, attempts to reduce psychological distress.\n\nIn 1954, while Festinger was refining his theory, he stumbled upon a rare opportunity to observe the effects of dissonance. A newspaper reported that a small Chicago-area group, the Seekers, were receiving messages from aliens about an impending flood that would submerge North America. Festinger and two colleagues, plus several assistants, went undercover. In an influential 1956 book, “When Prophecy Fails,” the trio wrote that the Seekers committed to the prediction so fully that some quit their jobs while emptying their savings accounts. When no flood or aliens arrived, Festinger and his colleagues wrote, the Seekers tried to reduce the dissonance they were experiencing by recommitting to their belief and evangelizing—a seeming attempt to bring others into alignment with their views. “Their research resulted in convincing, if not definitive, confirmation of their hypotheses,” a reviewer from the American Sociological Review wrote. In 1957, Festinger published another book, “A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance,” which described laboratory studies of people acting to resolve dissonance.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how influential the theory is today. “You almost certainly can’t get through an introductory psychology class without hearing about cognitive dissonance,” Adam Mastroianni, writer of the psychology Substack “Experimental History,” told me. The phrase has been invoked to explain why environmentalists eat meat and why some Trump supporters play down the President’s connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Last month, on social media, memes making fun of Cynthia Erivo, the lead actress in the “Wicked” films, for rushing to protect Ariana Grande from a fan, spread on social media. The musician SZA said that we’d eventually look back on these posts and experience cognitive dissonance.\n\nLately, though, the foundational case study of the Seekers has been contending with its own kind of dissonance. Until this year, a box of Festinger’s documents—communications with colleagues, research notes, transcribed telephone conversations—in his archives at the Bentley Historical Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, remained sealed at the request of his widow, Trudy. When the files were released, a political scientist named Thomas Kelly discovered that the researchers, who were ostensibly neutral observers, actually wielded a profound level of influence over the Seekers. In a recent peer-reviewed paper, Kelly noted that there were at least five paid observers in addition to the three researchers; at some Seekers meetings, half of those present may have been infiltrators. One research assistant pretended to dream about a flood and receive psychic messages; one of Festinger’s co-authors, Henry Riecken, was revered by the group’s leaders. When the flood didn’t come, Riecken apparently encouraged the Seekers to double down on their beliefs, Kelly told me in November. “Here’s this canonical study, and it’s backwards,” Kelly said. “This is misleading people about the dynamics of new religions and social psychology.”\n\nJoel Cooper, a psychologist at Princeton, remembered reading the study when he was an undergraduate. He was so surprised that he missed his subway stop. “That was unimaginable to the field of psychology at the time,” Cooper said. The prevailing dogma was that people, like Pavlov’s dogs, responded based on rewards. In this instance, those who were rewarded more said they liked the task less.",

    "description": ": Apparently you’re about to get better advice on any identity issues lurking in your infrastructure",
    "fullText": "Cisco has decided its homegrown AI models are ready to power its products, starting with its Duo Identity Intelligence offering.\n\nThe model Cisco will use is called “Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct”. As described on the Hugging Face model-mart, it’s an open-weight, 8-billion-parameter instruction-tuned “Auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture,” namely Meta Llama-3.1-8B backbone.\n\nCisco tuned the model for cybersecurity applications and optimized it for three uses:\n\nIn a Tuesday post, Cisco revealed it’s using the model with Duo Identity Intelligence, a service that analyzes who logs on to networks, where they log on from, and which devices they use.\n\n“By examining post authentication signals, the system identifies patterns that traditional access controls often miss, including unusual geographic activity, abnormal privilege usage, and indications of MFA fatigue attempts or session hijacking,” Cisco explained.\n\nThe product alerts users to potential identity issues in a weekly email digest that Cisco will now compose with help from its new model.\n\n“Producing such a digest requires an artificial intelligence model that understands identity behavior, can interpret long chains of events, and communicates insights in a way that aligns with how security administrators make decisions,” Cisco’s post states, adding that general-purpose models “are not always tuned for the nuance and precision required for identity security and often introduce external dependencies.”\n\nUsing its own model, Cisco says, will deliver “summaries that are more accurate, more readable, and more aligned with real security workflows.”\n\nThe company also says the content of the digests will become “noticeably stronger … clearer and more consistent.

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "description": "Hidden deep under the floorboards of a small house, an excavation team uncovered four silver bracelets dating to the Viking Age, likely from the 9th century AD.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA farm in the mountains of Norway stands on the site of what was once a “large and powerful Viking farm” and has yielded a significant Viking treasure.\n\nHidden deep under the floorboards of a small house, an excavation team uncovered four silver bracelets dating to the Viking Age, likely from the 9th century AD.\n\nThe silver bracelets were found in what was likely the same place they were originally buried, offering more insight into to the origin story of the treasure.\n\nSilver was the Vikings’ treasure of choice. Their affinity for the metal gives discoveries of silver artifacts significant historical value—much like a treasure recently found in the mountains of Norway, one that had sat undisturbed since the 9th century AD.\n\nBefore farmer Tårn Sigve Schmidt was able to carve a new road for his tractor on his mountainous farm near Årdal, northwest of Oslo, he had to call in archaeologists to make sure there were no unique areas he was about to disturb. It’s a good thing he did.\n\nSeven inches beneath the floorboards of what was likely once a house for Viking slaves, a team of archaeologists found four heavy silver bracelets, all with different decorations, likely from over 1,100 years ago.\n\n“At first, I thought it was a question of some twisted copper wires that you can often find in agricultural land,” field archaeologist Ola Tengesdal Lygre said in a translated statement from the University of Stavanger, “but when I saw that there were several next to each other and that they were not copper at all, but silver, I realized that we had found something exciting.”\n\nFurther investigation showed that, at one point, a “large and powerful Viking farm” was located on the property, with multiple houses and shelter for animals. The location gave the owners control of the entry into the fjord. The excavation crew also found soapstone pots, rivets, knife blades, and whetstones for sharpening tools.\n\nBut nothing is quite as exciting as buried treasure.\n\n“This is definitely the biggest thing I have experienced in my career,” Volker Demuth, project manager at the Archaeological Museum at the University of Stavanger, said in a statement. “This is a unique find, because we very rarely find such objects exactly where they were placed. As a rule, such valuable objects are discovered on fields that have been plowed, where an object has been completely taken out of its original context. Since the silver hoard has not been moved, it can give us completely new insights into life and society in the Viking Age.”\n\nThe bracelets were transported within the block of soil they were found to the museum. X-rays were taken, and the team will test soil samples to help give a broader picture of the setting, including if the silver was wrapped in a cloth when it was buried. The bracelets are reminiscent of the necklaces found in Hjelmeland in 1769, and the archaeologists haven’t yet ruled out a connection between the two discoveries.\n\nExperts believe that the farm was the victim of arson at one point, likely coinciding with a period of unrest during the Viking Age in Norway, which stretched from from 800 AD to 1050 AD. The farm and the discovered silver were likely from the 9th century, archaeologists believe.\n\n“If people who lived on this farm had to flee from an attack,” Demuth said, “it would be natural to hide away the valuables you had before escaping to the mountains. And perhaps in a place where you would not have thought that a treasure was hidden.”\n\nThe research team hasn’t yet found anything \n\nWith no silver mines in Norway at the time of the stashing, any silver owned by the Vikings had to come from abroad, either through trade, as a gift, or even as loot from a raid. The Vikings traded in silver more than gold, likely a byproduct of the regions in which they traveled.\n\n“This is an absolutely fantastic find,” said Ole Madsen, the museum’s director, “which gives us completely unique knowledge about one of the most central eras in Norway, namely the Viking Age. We will exhibit this as soon as it is ready to be displayed.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates. The 30-year fixed rate is holding above 6%, with little movement. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are holding mostly steady for yet another week. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is up one basis point to 6.09%. The 15-year fixed home loan rate is down six basis points to 5.52%. The stability of mortgage rates over the past several weeks is welcomed by borrowers looking to lock in a rate.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week, Dec. 15, 2025.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.09% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be even higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the most recent cut to the federal funds rate, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October. The Fed is currently signaling a single rate cut for 2026, with perhaps one more in 2027.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been hovering in a range — but there has been a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, they remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount.

    "fullText": "Crypto markets were already on edge heading into President Donald Trump’s 9 PM EST primetime address to the nation from the White House.\n\nOnchain analysts spotted a large Ethereum move into Binance — the kind of transfer traders often associate with potential selling pressure, even when intentions are unclear.\n\nTrump said he would deliver “an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,” in a Truth Social post on Dec. 16.\n\nThe president did not specify a topic for the address, leaving markets to price in uncertainty ahead of the broadcast.\n\nFor crypto traders, high-profile political speeches can act like sudden volatility triggers, not necessarily because of direct crypto policy, but because they can shift expectations around the dollar, rates, risk appetite and market regulation.\n\nThat dynamic can lead some participants to cut leverage or reduce exposure ahead of time.\n\nOn Dec. 17, hours before Trump's 9 p.m. address to the nation, blockchain analytics account Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet “fully exited 10,169 $ETH ($29.7M)” and claimed:\n\n“Over the past 3 years, the whale has made a total profit of $11.36M trading $ETH.”\n\nThe post linked to Arkham Intelligence, where the address page shows a transfer of 10,169 ETH to a Binance deposit destination in recent activity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,014, up 1.8% in a day. Bitcoin was trading at $90,051, up 2.51% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLeaked memo shows popular crypto firm may wind down\n\nBitcoin, XRP slide as traders brace for key U.S. data\n\nAnalyst downgrades MicroStrategy amid higher dilution\n\nLarge holders - often called “crypto whales” - can influence liquidity and short-term price action simply by moving size, especially around major headline events.\n\nIn practice, traders tend to read whale deposits to exchanges as a potentially bearish signal (possible selling), while withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as more bullish (potential long-term holding).\n\nBut those signals can be noisy: whales also move funds for custody changes, collateral management, OTC settlement, or strategic rotation.\n\nWith Trump’s address set for 9 p.m. ET, traders will likely watch two things closely: whether more large wallets send crypto to exchanges in the hours before the speech, and whether derivatives markets show signs of rapid deleveraging.",

The record price for spot gold was trading at an intraday high of $4,380.99 an ounce Oct. 17, according to Kitco.com.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Dec. 11, the day I trekked out in the cold to get a few price quotes, the spot gold price was trading around $4,250 an ounce — up nearly 63% so far in 2025.\n\nOn Dec. 11, gold shot up to the highest point in more than a month, following the Federal Reserve's decision Dec. 10 to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Traders expect lower interest rates ahead, which can be bullish for gold prices.\n\nYet if you're thinking about taking advantage of high gold prices to get rid of some gold, maybe a broken chain for a locket or even a gold ring from a loved one, you shouldn't expect to receive the same amount of money everywhere you go.\n\nWhat different jewelers and pawn shops offer to pay a seller for old gold jewelry can vary substantially — even as much as 50% in one example I found recently. Sometimes, the price difference is even higher.\n\nGold is volatile in price but viewed as a hedge against uncertain times — and we've had our share in 2025. Persistent inflation; three rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2025 after three rate cuts in 2024, which make some savings vehicles less attractive; a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar; global tensions relating to tariffs and wars.\n\nGold is commanding a higher price for many shoppers this holiday season, too, according to the annual PNC Christmas Price Index that reviews the cost of the gifts from the classic holiday carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas.\"\n\n\"Five gold rings saw the single-biggest price jump by far\" in that grouping of 12 categories, including a partridge in a pear tree.

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "House Republicans on Wednesday approved a narrow package designed to lower health care costs for some Americans in the coming years – marking a win for leadership even as some of their own members complain it falls woefully short of tackling rising prices in 2026.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson and his team were aggressive in pushing their health care plan to the floor this week, vowing it will be the first step of a major GOP agenda on lowering costs next year.\n\nThey are specifically ignoring, however, the issue of the expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies that were passed during the pandemic to help people afford premium costs. Those tax credits will expire at the end of the month, spiking premiums for tens of millions of Americans next year.\n\nThe House GOP package, instead, would allow small businesses — as well as self-employed people — to band together across industries to buy coverage through association health plans in an effort to lower premiums. It would also, once again, provide federal funding for the cost-sharing subsidies that lower-income Obamacare enrollees receive to reduce their deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for care.\n\nHouse Republicans would also require pharmacy benefit managers, which act as middlemen between drugmakers and insurers or employers, to provide employers with data on the price of drugs, the rebates they receive from manufacturers and other operations.\n\nThe House voted 216-211 to send the measure to the Senate, which is not expected to vote on it before lawmakers leave town for the holiday recess.\n\nThe last-minute health care push from GOP leaders comes at a fraught moment for the party: President Donald Trump is striving to show he is making progress to lower costs for everyday Americans. But his own members are attacking Johnson and other GOP leaders for ignoring the looming Obamacare subsidies cliff, which would raise costs for tens of millions of Americans starting in January.\n\nIf the enhanced subsidies lapse, enrollees will see their annual premium payments increase by 114% — or about $1,000 — on average in 2026, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Roughly 2 million more people are also expected to be uninsured next year if the subsidies end, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The more generous assistance was enacted in 2021 as part of a Biden administration Covid-19 relief package.\n\nA group of GOP centrists have been pressuring Johnson for months to reverse course on the subsidies — pushing bipartisan efforts to extend the subsidies while adding “guardrails” to ensure the dollars are not misused.\n\nBut Johnson has only dug in. Those centrists then decided Wednesday to openly defy Johnson and potentially issue him a humiliating defeat in January by signing onto a Democratic effort to extend the subsidies for three years. That plan from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is detested by most Republicans because it includes no reforms.\n\nBut centrists insist they had no other options to keep the money flowing in January – and prevent millions from losing coverage altogether – after party leaders repeatedly blocked their attempts to get a floor vote on the compromise proposals.",

The two ‍planes will be used for crew training and as a source of spare parts, officials said.\n\nSeveral published reports suggested the Air Force was buying the planes from Lufthansa, one of the ​few passenger airlines to have bought the 747-8 model, which was more popular ‌with cargo carriers before Boeing ended production in early 2023. A spokesperson for the German airline declined to comment.\n\nThe purchase is separate from two 747-8i aircraft that Boeing is currently modifying under the VC-25B program, which will serve as the next generation of Air Force One. The first of those heavily modified aircraft is expected to ⁠be delivered in mid-2028, the Air Force said.\n\nAn ​Air Force official, speaking on background, said the ​two training aircraft were also distinct from a 747-8i aircraft gifted to the United States by Qatar.\n\nThe Air Force One program has faced ‍delays and cost overruns ⁠since Boeing agreed to a $3.9 billion fixed-price contract in 2018 to deliver two modified 747-8s to replace the current fleet.\n\nThe Air Force said on Friday ⁠the delivery of the first of the two new Air Force One jets from Boeing had ‌been delayed by another year to mid-2028.",

    "fullText": "There may be more evidence in the murder of child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey. Her father, John, revealed more evidence has been uncovered to help solve the case.\n\nSix-year-old JonBenet was killed inside her Boulder, Colorado home on Christmas in 1996. Her body was discovered seven hours after she was reported missing. Her cause of death was strangulation, along with head trauma.\n\nDuring an interview on NewsNation’s Banfield, John said there has been “new evidence” that may finally help solve this case. He said, “Chief Redfern told us, gosh, I don’t know, September, we had a meeting with him, and that he had submitted evidence for additional DNA testing. He didn’t say what the evidence was, but that it was submitted again, or perhaps new.”\n\nAlthough John wasn’t clear on whether the evidence is new or had been previously tested, he called the development “encouraging.” He added that the authorities “have advocated that if certain evidence that was taken from the crime scene has never been sampled, that it ought to be the main one being the [unintelligible] that was used to strangle my daughter.”\n\nJohn admitted he wasn’t told specifics about the evidence, but has more confidence in the current leadership. “It was not very good for 25, 26 years, and Chief Redfern from the outside, I’ve met with him three or four times,” he said. “I’m impressed with him. I think he’s sincere and honest, and so I’m encouraged, and you know, we’ve advocated.”\n\nHe will inquire about the evidence, including whether the DNA was tested in the latest format necessary to do IGG, investigative genealogy. “And that would be very encouraging to us if they’ve done that,” John said. “This new technology, it’s been around for three or four years, is really, truly an investigative tool that allows police to investigate and look for the killer. The CODIS federal database of DNA has been around for 30 years. It’s, frankly, a little obsolete, in my opinion.”\n\nJohn, who says he’s more optimistic than he’s been in a long time, will request a January meeting for updates.\n\nTELL US – WILL THE KILLER BE CAUGHT?\n\nThe post JonBenet Ramsey’s Father Confirms Bombshell ‘Evidence’ in Murder appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "description": "The person in the photo was \"in proximity of\" the person of interest in the mass shooting at Brown University shooting, police said.",
    "fullText": "Providence police on Wednesday afternoon released an “enhanced” image of a person seen near the man identified as a person of interest in the shooting at Brown University on Saturday that killed two students and injured nine.\n\nTo date, it is the clearest image released by police in the ongoing manhunt for the person responsible for the mass shooting at the Ivy League university in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nIn the photo, the unidentified person is seen wearing a black jat, a hooded sweatshirt, a black hat and glasses. Police say the person in the photo was \"in proximity of the person of interest.\"\n\nAnyone who recognizes the person, or with information about the shooting, is urged to call the tip line at 401-272-3121.\n\nAs the manhunt for the gunman who took the lives of two students stretches into Wednesday, investigators say their highest priority is identifying a person of interest they’ve released numerous photos and videos of. Officials said during a Tuesday evening press conference that they believe this is the critical next step in charging someone in the shooting.\n\n“Once we identify who this person is, I believe we’ll be able to locate them,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.\n\nGunfire erupted on the first floor of Brown’s Barus and Holley engineering and physics building around 4 p.m. on Dec. 13 during an economics class. The shooting left sophomore Ella Cook and first-year student Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov dead and nine other students injured.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, one of the injured students was in critical condition, five more were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition, according to law enforcement and Brown University. Two have been released from Rhode Island Hospital.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have described the person of interest as being approximately 5-foot-8 inches tall with a “stocky build.” Photos and videos shared by police show what appears to be man dressed in dark clothing, including a beanie and face mask, walking down the street near Brown University approximately two hours before the shooting.\n\nOfficials have asked anyone associated with Brown or who lives or spends time around Providence to review the photos and videos of the person of interest. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the “identification, arrest and conviction of the individual.”\n\nProvidence Police Chief Col. Oscar L. Perez, Jr. advised the public to focus on the body movements of the person of interest shown in the videos during the press conference Tuesday evening.\n\n“You wanna focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry their weight,” he said.\n\nInvestigators said they are hoping to receive more footage of the person of interest from the public, as they speculate that he may have walked around the area surrounding Brown University as much as a week prior to the shooting.\n\n“We also know in this profession that many criminals will pace out an area weeks and days prior,” Perez explained.\n\nPolice share map of Brown University shooting person of interest’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting investigation spills over into Massachusetts\n\nInvestigators release video timeline of person of interest in Brown campus shooting’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting victim remembered for having a heart ‘as large as the sun’\n\nPolice now trying to ID person ‘in proximity of’ Brown University shooting person of interest",

    "description": "Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged Tricolor execs Daniel Chu and David Goodgame of scheming to defraud banks and private credit lenders.",
    "fullText": "Founder Daniel Chu and the company's Chief Operating Officer David Goodgame, who were arrested and charged with bank fraud and wire fraud on Wednesday, planned to frighten at least one lender into a favorable deal, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the executives discussed telling a lender that the company might otherwise implode, much like the energy trading firm Enron in 2001, if a deal wasn't reached. This would be bad for the lender because it would put them at risk of losing everything.\n\n\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said when discussing with other Tricolor executives how to deal with one particular lender who had figured out the double-pledging issue.\n\n\"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that. It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

    "title": "My kids already lead privileged lives, so I refuse to go all out at Christmas",
    "description": "I already have a full-time job. I have no intention of taking on the unpaid role of Christmas Fairy in my house.",
    "fullText": "Here's what you won't find in my house at Christmastime: Elf on the Shelf. December goody and craft boxes for the kids. Brand new matching Christmas pajamas. Holiday photo shoots. Forced Christmas card writing. Expensive tickets to line up at a crowded shopping center to see an overrated Santa.\n\nBefore you write me off as a Christmas Grinch who needs a visit from three ghosts in the middle of the night to reinvigorate my festive mojo, hear me out.\n\nNot going all out at Christmas is intentional for two reasons. Firstly, I don't want to be that frazzled mom who stretches herself in 20 different directions trying to create a magical Christmas for everyone, decorating the perfect house, and buying every gift on everyone's wish list.\n\nI already have a full-time job, and I have no intention of taking on the unpaid role of Christmas Fairy.\n\nSecondly, my kids already lead highly privileged lives. The only time they have known hunger is when there's a long line at McDonald's. My 6-year-old son's extracurricular activities include French and fencing lessons — and no, he doesn't attend a fancy private school; they are just some of the many before- and after-school activity options we're lucky to have at our school.\n\nMeanwhile, his 3-year-old brother's daycare has a chef who cooks him a hot, gourmet lunch every day. That certainly beats my microwaved canned soup.\n\nRather than spending excessive money on material things, we prefer to enrich our lives through travel. This year alone, we've taken family trips to the Seychelles, Finland, Australia, and Tenerife.\n\nIt's safe to say, then, that my kids live with abundance. We don't need the extra pressure to push that even further this month, just because we're told we're bad parents if we don't.\n\nI don't want December to be something that we dread and feel we have to get through, because we have created so many tasks that end up draining our energy, rather than use this period to reset before the New Year hits.\n\nI know my fellow moms are experiencing this because I hear about it all the time. Recent stats show that here in the UK, where we live, 62 percent of moms say they find Christmas \"fairly stressful,\" compared with 44 percent of dads, and 45 percent of women without children. I don't want to be one of those.\n\nThe other day, I overheard some moms at school pickup complaining about how much they had to do before Christmas, and how they were worried about running out of time. I felt like interrupting them to say, \"But do you really need to do all of it? Who said you had to do it all?\"\n\nBut before I could do that, they both came to the very wise conclusion that their New Year's resolution would be to commit to doing less. Instead of feeling guilty for my Grinch-like mindset, I felt like clapping out loud at their realization that many of our supposed Christmas commitments are self-imposed, and the world won't end if we say \"no\" to more things.\n\nI have also spoken to other moms who are planning to prioritize what they find meaningful over what the typical Christmas movie might portray.\n\nOne friend is even doing away with the traditional roast turkey dinner with all the trimmings and instead putting together a grazing table of everyone's favorite foods.\n\nAs for us, we're also skipping the British tradition of the Christmas pantomime show this year. Many families look forward to a TV celebrity taking on the main part of a fairy godmother or an ugly sister in a campy fairy tale performed onstage. But with tickets for a family of four coming to several hundred dollars, it's hard to justify the expense each year.\n\nI want my kids to grow up feeling that their lives are already full, and that they don't need certain things just because other people have them, or social media and TV said they should have them.\n\nThat doesn't mean we're not embracing Christmas in our own way, focusing on people rather than following trends and holiday traditions that we didn't ask to inherit.\n\nMy oldest recently went with his class to a local nursing home to sing Christmas carols to the residents. I can only imagine how happy they must have felt to see 30 6- and 7-year-olds belting out \"Jingle Bell Rock.\" My son was proud of his efforts, as was I, knowing that he had secretly learned the lesson of purpose over presents.\n\nSo, no, I don't feel the need to manufacture what others may define as a magical Christmas.\n\nThis is what would be magical for me: Taking a break from relentless work deadlines, calls, and emails. Not having to leave the house at 8:30 a.m. to get to school. Having movie days in our pajamas. Taking walks in the windswept woods. Eating party food for lunch just because we can. Doing what we want, not what society tells us we should do.\n\nIt seems that our boys are already getting the message. For example, we asked them if they wanted to visit a shopping center in Santa, which can cost between $10 and $50, where we live. I was prepared to suck up for the sake of Christmas if they really needed the experience. They both shook their heads and said they'd already seen Santa drive down our actual street. What could top that?\n\nThis lesson seems to be translating into real life outside of Christmas as well. My oldest will turn 7 at the end of January, which is always a challenge to find the enthusiasm for after the holiday season. We offered to throw him a mini golf and pizza party just like the one he recently attended. His answer was that he'd prefer to just go out for a burger with a few of his best friends.\n\nWhen kids realize that more isn't necessarily better, it's a life lesson that's hard to believe they've learned — and I'm convinced that keeping it real at Christmas is the key to that.",

    "description": "The Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, is in full production after trainings, live-fire exercises, and upgrades.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has a new air defense system built to transform light vehicles into mobile weapons for shooting down drones and other aircraft.\n\nThe technology is intended to equip Marines with a new way to deal with drones and other aerial threats, the service announced this week. As the war in Ukraine has shown, the ability to counter these types of threats is critical in modern conflict.\n\nThe new Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, entered full-rate production earlier this fall after training and live-fire exercises. Placed on top of a pair of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, MADIS converts the vehicles into a single short-ranged ground-based air defense system.\n\nThe vehicles work together, with one focused on countering drones and the other geared toward helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. MADIS uses Stinger missiles and a 30mm cannon for those targets, and it also comes with radars and electronic warfare systems. Marines can also use MADIS while on the move, giving the service a mobile air defense option.\n\nIt's a capability boost over the service's Man-Portable Air Defense System, or MANPAD, which Marines would've had to equip themselves and leave vehicles to use. MADIS is also capable of being upgraded over time, depending on what types of threats Marines are facing and what weapons they need for specific missions.\n\nMADIS, developed by the Norwegian firm Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, has undergone several iterations since its initial prototype. The Marine Corps said its full-rate production version has sensors, algorithms, and mobility that allow Marines to locate, target, and destroy threats faster and better than before. Its first live-fire exercise took place during joint US-Philippine military training earlier this year.\n\nMarine Corps officials have said MADIS fills a gap in their air defense arsenal and is unique because it can complete the entire kill chain. Marines can use it to find and identify targets and then take them out rather than relying on several systems to do the same.\n\nMADIS also addresses Marine Corps concerns around how to defeat small uncrewed aerial systems in a potential future war.\n\nSince MADIS is mobile, it gives Marines a new way to defend forward-deployed forces — especially in a potential future fight against a sophisticated adversary like China.\n\nAs the Marine Corps reshapes its force for operations across the first island chain, from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines, it needs systems that can move quickly and deliver more firepower against a wide range of aerial threats.",

    "fullText": "Another day, another update that's giving investors anxiety about the AI trade.\n\nThe US tech sector was under pressure on Wednesday as traders took in a report from The Financial Times that said Blue Owl Capital wouldn't back a $10 billion data center the company was planning to build in Michigan for OpenAI.\n\nOracle shares led the broader market lower, falling as much as 6% Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly around 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the market:\n\nThe latest developments extend a broader rotation out of the market's most expensive tech stocks and into other parts of the market.\n\nThe enthusiasm for AI has dampened particularly in the past week, Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Additionally, rotation pressure out of tech has accelerated, with positioning data showing rising demand for smaller-cap and value stocks,\" Turnquist said of the latest market moves.\n\nThe FT's report said that talks between Oracle and Blue Owl Capital stalled over the planned data center. The private credit firm will not move forward with funding the project due to concerns about Oracle's hefty AI spending and growing debts, sources told the outlet.\n\nOracle disputed the contents of the FT report.\n\n\"The FT story is incorrect. Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl. Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,\" Michael Egbert, a spokesperson for Oracle, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for the AI trade, but particularly for Oracle. After impressing investors with an aggressive revenue forecast, the stock has declined steadily in the last two months as the company stokes more concerns about the large amounts of debt coursing through the AI space. Shares are down 45% from their peak in early September.\n\nOracle recently triggered another sell-off in tech after reporting lower-than-expected earnings and pledging to increase its capital expenditures more than expected in the coming year.\n\nCoreWeave is the other prominent tech name to join Oracle recently as a poster child of investors' growing anxieties about the health of the AI trade. Similar to Oracle, CoreWeave has spooked investors with its high debt load and reliance on a handful of customers. As of Wednesday afternoon, the stock is down 66% from its post-IPO high reached in June.",

    "fullText": "The executive who led Amazon's efforts to build top AI models is out.\n\nRohit Prasad, SVP and head scientist, is leaving two years after launching a new Artificial General Intelligence group.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said Prasad plans to depart at the end of the year. Prasad was elevated to report directly to Jassy in 2023 to lead the AGI team, which was tasked with developing Amazon's \"most ambitious\" AI models, Business Insider reported at the time.\n\nSince then, Prasad helped launch Amazon's Nova family of AI models. Although Nova models earned some praise for their efficiency, they still trail frontier models such as OpenAI's GPT offerings, Anthropic's Claude Opus, and Google's Gemini.\n\nAs part of the shake-up, Amazon is creating a new organization under Peter DeSantis, AWS's SVP of Utility Computing, Jassy said. The group will oversee Amazon's AGI and AI model initiatives as well as its silicon chip and quantum computing efforts.\n\nJassy also said that Pieter Abbeel, the co-founder of robotics startup Covariant, who joined Amazon last year, will now lead the company's frontier AI model research team.\n\nPrasad's departure is the latest in a series of leadership changes at AWS. Over the past year, the company has seen several executives depart, including VP of AI Matt Wood and VP of generative AI Vasi Philomin, while bringing in new talent such as former Microsoft executive Julia White as chief marketing officer.\n\nAWS also recently hired David Richardson as VP of AgentCore and Joe Hellerstein as Vice President and Distinguished Scientist, and added Chet Kapoor as VP of security services and observability.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Christmas celebrations at the White House date back to 1800, but Hanukkah wasn't acknowledged until much later.",
    "fullText": "The White House hasn't always marked the Festival of Lights with menorah lightings and musical performances.\n\nOfficial Christmas celebrations date back to the 1800s, but celebrating Hanukkah at the White House is a fairly recent development in US history.\n\nPresident John Adams hosted the first White House Christmas party in 1800, and President Calvin Coolidge held the first National Christmas Tree lighting in 1923. Jacqueline Kennedy began the tradition of choosing a theme for the White House Christmas decorations in 1961.\n\nStill, the first official White House Hanukkah reception wasn't held until 2001.\n\nTake a look at the fascinating history of how the White House Hanukkah party came to be.\n\nThe menorah lighting was held on the Ellipse, a lawn south of the White House.\n\nThe secretary of the interior under Carter initially refused to issue a permit for a menorah on the White House lawn, citing the First Amendment, The Washington Post reported. But Stu Eizenstat, one of Carter's advisors, argued that the National Christmas Tree's permit should also be denied on the same grounds, and the event was allowed to proceed.\n\nSince then, every US president has marked Hanukkah in one way or another.\n\nReagan maintained contact with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement, throughout his presidency, even declaring his 80th birthday a National Day of Reflection, according to Chabad.org.\n\nBush invited children to light Hanukkah candles and play dreidel at the Old Executive Building, which sits adjacent to the White House.\n\nChildren from local schools and synagogues were welcomed into the Oval Office to light the menorah and play dreidel with Clinton.\n\nMaking the White House kitchen kosher involves Saran Wrap, tin foil, and vats of boiling water to cover and purify non-kosher surfaces. The chefs use only certified kosher ingredients.\n\nMatt Nosanchuk served as the White House's associate director of public engagement and liaison to the American Jewish community during Obama's second term. He told Business Insider that there used to be separate tables for kosher and non-kosher food at Bush's Hanukkah parties, but one year, the labels were accidentally switched.\n\nRabbi Levi Shemtov, a Chabad rabbi in Washington, DC, who worked closely with the White House staff to prepare kosher food, suggested making the entire reception kosher to avoid confusion in the future, Nosanchuk said.\n\n\"Apparently, President Bush said, 'Do whatever you need to do, it's fine,' and Rabbi Shemtov was like, 'Well, you're going to have to stay out of the kitchen for 24 hours before the party,'\" Nosanchuk said.\n\nThe Kol Zimra a cappella choir performed at a menorah lighting ceremony before the White House Hanukkah reception in 2004.\n\nThe two identical receptions were hosted on the same day, so that the White House kitchen only has to be made kosher once.\n\n\"Given how crowded the previous parties had become, they decided to have two,\" Nosanchuk said.\n\nIn 2013, then-10-year-old Asher Weintraub invented a \"menurkey,\" a menorah shaped like a turkey. He raised over $48,000 on Kickstarter to produce and sell them.\n\n\"Of course, I said we gotta invite this kid to the White House Hanukkah party,\" Nosanchuk said. \"We didn't use the menurkey onstage, but we made sure the kid was up front on the rope line so that he could say hello to President Obama and present him with a menurkey. And President Obama loved the menurkey.\"\n\nMike Boxer performed with the Jewish a cappella group Six13 at the White House Hanukkah reception in 2016. He told Business Insider the performers usually sing in the foyer outside the party for about an hour, welcoming guests as they enter, and then have a private audience with the president and first lady.\n\nBefore meeting the Obamas, Boxer and his group were told to prepare 45 seconds of a song to perform for them. They chose a snippet from \"A Hamilton Chanukah,\" a medley of songs from the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" rewritten with Hanukkah-themed lyrics.\n\nBoxer said that their private concert featured some unexpected guests.\n\n\"We look over, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor are peering through the door,\" he said. \"Barack Obama goes, 'Come in, come in.' One of them said, 'I love this stuff.'\"\n\nIn his public engagement role at the White House, Nosanchuk was responsible for the guest list of the Hanukkah reception. Every year, the list was built from scratch to include as many new people as possible.\n\n\"I went out of my way to invite people who had never been before, who had done interesting and important and valuable work in the Jewish community or in their broader community,\" he said. \"There were a wide array of constituencies and groups and individuals who we wanted to engage with and touch during these holiday receptions. The Hanukkah receptions were a subset of that larger group.\"\n\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter, is Jewish. She converted before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2017 that Trump broke with tradition by excluding Democratic lawmakers from the guest list of what had previously been a bipartisan event.\n\nThen-chief of staff to first lady Melania Trump, Stephanie Grisham, told Business Insider in a statement that masks would be required and provided at the events, hand-sanitizing stations would be set up, chefs would serve food from behind plexiglass barriers, and that the guest lists were \"smaller.\" She did not respond to Business Insider's questions about the exact number of invited guests.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that Trump attended only the evening Hanukkah reception, where he falsely claimed that with the help of \"certain very important people, if they have wisdom and if they have courage, we are going to win this election.\" Joe Biden had already been declared the winner the previous month.\n\nThree days after the party, vice chairman of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee Tom Mountain was hospitalized with COVID-19, which he attributed to his attendance at the event.\n\n\"Let's put it this way: When I went down to Washington, DC, for the White House Hanukkah event, I was perfectly fine,\" Mountain told NBC affiliate WJAR. \"And three days later after that event, I was in the hospital … ready to be put on a lifesaving ventilator.\"\n\n\"To think that today, I'm here before you as the first Jewish spouse of an American president or vice president celebrating Hanukkah, in the people's house, it's humbling, and it's not lost on me that I stand before you all on behalf of all the Jewish families and communities out there across our country,\" Emhoff said. \"I understand that, and I really appreciate it.\"\n\nThe Jewish Telegraphic Agency's Ron Kampeas reported that invitations to the in-person White House Hanukkah party on December 1 were sent out a week before the event, and that holiday plans took shape relatively last-minute due to COVID-19 concerns surrounding in-person events.\n\nLocated in the Cross Hall, the menorah was built by White House carpenters using leftover wood from a Truman-era White House renovation.\n\nIn addition to the regular White House Hanukkah gathering on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff hosted the first-ever Hanukkah party at the vice president's residence.\n\n\"As president of the United States, I will always support Jewish Americans,\" Trump said during the celebration, \"and I will always be a friend and a champion of the Jewish people.\"\n\nThe National Menorah is now a 30-foot-tall structure that requires a lift from a cherry picker to light.\n\nThis year's National Menorah Lighting, broadcast on C-SPAN, took place on December 14.",

    "description": "YouTube announced that it has secured the global rights to Hollywood's biggest night, a major victory in the fight over live events.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's biggest night is going to a streamer.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Wednesday that YouTube will hold the global rights to the Oscars from 2029 through 2033.\n\nWhile that means they'll no longer be on ABC starting in 2029, ending a more than 50-year run of consecutive broadcasts on the television network, the Oscars will continue to be available for free worldwide — just on YouTube and YouTube TV. As part of the partnership, red carpet coverage and other behind-the-scenes content from before the award show is also included.\n\nThe news comes as streamers like YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, and others, increasingly compete over live events to host on their respective platforms. Historically, the Oscars are one of the most-watched nights of TV, and in non-presidential election years, it is often the only non-sporting event to chart within the top 100 most-watched telecasts of the year.\n\n\"The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,\" YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. \"Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy.\"\n\nDisney and ABC will continue to hold the rights to the Oscars through 2028, including the milestone 100th Academy Awards.\n\nOutside of the Oscars, the Google Arts & Culture initiative will provide digital access to select Academy Museum exhibitions and programs, the academy said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement was also struck at a time when YouTube has evolved beyond a place people post and watch short clips and amateur videos on mobile and desktop to become a fixture in the living room. The monthly Nielsen Gauge shows YouTube grabbing the top spot in share of TV viewing among media companies for months running, with a 12.9% share in October, ahead of Disney (11.4%) and NBCUniversal (8.6%).\n\nThe nature of what people are watching has also changed. The streaming data analysis company Digital i found that videos lasting 30 minutes or more accounted for 73% of total viewing on YouTube in the US in October 2024, up 8% from a year earlier.\n\nYouTube has encouraged this shift, rolling out new tools for creators to incentivize them to make serialized shows that look like what you think of as traditional TV.\n\nYouTube's living room-domination plans loomed in the background of its recent highly public dispute with Disney over how much it should pay the media company to carry its channels like ESPN and ABC News on YouTube TV. Google recently shared numbers showing YouTube TV was the No. 4 pay-TV service in the US.\n\nTraditional media companies have tried to combat YouTube's expansion by taking a page from the platform and striking deals with YouTube video creators and podcasters.",

    "description": "At a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters, Musk discussed the company's future, its finances, and data centers in space.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk appears to be feeling upbeat about the future of his AI company.\n\nAt a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters last week, Musk told staff that if the company could survive the next two to three years, xAI would triumph over its competitors, several sources with knowledge of the meeting said.\n\nThe xAI CEO said that the company's ability to rapidly scale its power and data capacity would be a key ingredient in the race to achieve superintelligence — which surpasses human intelligence — and become the most powerful AI company.\n\nMusk said that xAI could achieve artificial general intelligence, which matches or exceeds human intelligence, in the next few years, even as soon as 2026, sources said.\n\nMusk said in November that xAI had a 10% likelihood of achieving AGI with its Grok 5 model, which he has said the company plans to release early next year.\n\nThe CEO also told staff that xAI would have an advantage over other AI companies because it would have access to around $20 billion to $30 billion in funding per year, and it could benefit from its proximity to his other companies, sources said. Tesla integrated Grok into its vehicles earlier this year.\n\nOverall, workers said Musk appeared happy with the company's progress. One insider described the meeting as \"peppy.\"\n\nMusk also theorized about building data centers in space and his plans to colonize Mars, the sources said. He said that Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot could eventually man such extraterrestrial data centers, the people said.\n\nMusk has previously said that Optimus could provide support for SpaceX missions as soon as next year. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have publicly talked about the possibility of building data centers in space, though Pichai acknowledged that it is a \"moonshot.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for a comment, the company responded with an automated message: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nOver the past year, xAI has rapidly expanded the footprint of its data centers, a project it has named Colossus. Earlier this year, the company said it had around 200,000 GPUs, and Musk has said it plans to expand to 1 million GPUs.\n\nxAI is one of many companies racing to build AGI and justify valuations worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite Musk's outsize profile, xAI is still a relatively new player in a race dominated by giants like OpenAI and Google.\n\nThe AI race shows no signs of slowing down. Earlier this month, OpenAI entered a state of emergency as it raced to push out its latest model, according to reports. Google released a new Gemini model in November, and xAI has pushed new versions of Grok in rapid succession.\n\nDuring the all-hands, xAI leads demonstrated several updates to existing products, such as Grok Voice, the company's app for Tesla owners, and its agents, sources said. Some of the updates included improvements to Grok's ability to predict outcomes, better listening functions for Grok voice, and video editing, the people said.\n\nDo you work at xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "Moving the Oscars from ABC to the internet is hugely symbolic. That doesn't mean that a huge audience will follow.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood may be embattled. But it's still capable of putting out a compelling narrative: On Wednesday morning, news broke that Netflix has won (for now) the right to buy Warner Bros. studio and HBO.\n\nA few hours later, news broke that YouTube is going to be the new host of the Oscars.\n\nEven the dullest of us can understand this storyline: In a single day, three of old media's most treasured assets have been acquired by digital usurpers — internet services that used to be dismissed by media giants, and are now giants themselves.\n\nIf Netflix does end up walking away with most of Warner Bros., that's a big, structural change. A purely digital outlet will control a movie studio that (still) puts movies into movie theaters, as well as the most prestigious premium TV service.\n\nAnd while I'm still processing this one, I think moving the Oscars from ABC — in 2029, when the five-year deal kicks in — is going to be more symbolic than tectonic. That is: If you are someone who liked watching the Oscars on ABC, you'll just watch it on YouTube.\n\nIt's possible that YouTube version of the Oscars could look and feel radically different. But I doubt it, because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — the people who actually run the Oscars and produce the show — will still be running the Oscars and producing the show. And my hunch is YouTube has already promised the Academy that the 2029 Oscars will look and feel just like the 2026 Oscars.\n\nWhich brings us to the next question: Will moving the Oscars from a TV channel to an internet service bring any more eyeballs to the Oscars? Because right now, the Oscars seem like a product in permanent decline: In 1998, when \"Titanic\" was a megahit and most people treated the internet as a novelty, viewership peaked at 57 million US viewers. It has been steadily eroding since then, and now brings in less than half of that — which means Hollywood's biggest night brings in considerably fewer eyeballs than an average NFL game.\n\nEvery year, there is lots of hand-wringing and debate about why that's the case: Moviegoing itself is in decline; the awards often feature movies that people who do go to movies have never heard of; the show itself isn't nearly as interesting as it could be.\n\nBut there really shouldn't be any debate at all: TV is less popular because of the internet. So everything on TV — with the sole exception of the NFL — is less popular.\n\nSo while moving the Oscars from a broadcast TV network to the internet, and making the Oscars available worldwide, for free, will certainly increase the potential audience, I'm not sure that many more people will find it compelling.\n\nYes, it's cool to see stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet — the two leading contenders for the 2026 Best Actor award — sitting in the Dolby Theatre. But even if that happens, there's a very good chance that you won't have seen the movies they've been nominated for. So whether the show is on TV or an app, are you going to tune in — especially when you can already see Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet on Instagram and TikTok, 24/7?\n\nIf the Academy wants bigger audiences, YouTube is a fine place to look. They just might not like what they find.",

    "title": "The 6 biggest reveals from WBD's filing on why it rejected Paramount",
    "description": "A new filing says Paramount offered pay and a job to WBD CEO David Zaslav, and gives other takeaways from the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery didn't just reject Paramount again on Wednesday. It also pulled back the curtain on what the bidding war was like behind the scenes.\n\nWBD advised shareholders to dismiss Paramount's $30-per-share offer for the company and stick with Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share (for only its studios and streaming business). In a filing, WBD's board called Paramount's latest bid inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on shareholders compared to Netflix's bid, which it said offered superior value and more certainty.\n\nSome of the information in the filing had already been made public, but it revealed some juicy bits that haven't been reported.\n\nHere are the top six takeaways:\n\nRight after WBD rejected one of multiple secret bids in September, David Ellison called Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to request that Zaslav meet with his father, Larry Ellison. The conventional wisdom was that the Oracle cofounder's billions would prevail. In the end, that didn't happen. WBD expressed concern that the bid relied on a revocable trust, whose assets or liabilities were subject to change.\n\nWe already knew Zaslav stood to make over $500 million from a Paramount deal, based mainly on his shares that would vest immediately after it closed ($567,712,631, to be exact, according to the filing). Zaslav told the WBD board that the Ellisons had \"indicated to him that\" if a deal went through, he would \"receive a compensation package worth several hundred million dollars,\" per the filing. Zaslav responded that it \"would be inappropriate to discuss any such arrangements at that time,\" he told the board.\n\nParamount also offered Zaslav the position of co-CEO and co-chairman of the combined company, a role Netflix didn't offer, the filing said.\n\nThat runs contrary to the narrative put forth in a letter Paramount's attorneys at Quinn Emanuel sent to WBD, stating they suspected the process was biased in favor of Netflix due to WBD leadership's expectations that there could be roles for them at the new company. Paramount's legal and financial advisors didn't know about the \"December 3 Quinn Emanuel\" letter and, in their view, the letter should not have been sent, was \"not helpful,\" and was a \"mistake,\" the filing says.\n\nThe filing revealed the presence of a fourth, previously unknown bidder in the process, \"Company C,\" which proposed acquiring WBD's cable channels and 20% of its streaming and studio businesses for $25 billion in cash.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Company C was Starz. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm that. Starz declined to comment.\n\nWBD determined that the Company C bid was \"not actionable\" and continued to work with Netflix, Paramount, and \"Company A\" (clearly Comcast).\n\nSome of Wall Street's marquee names — Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan, and Evercore — are set to make a total of $225 million in connection with WBD's sale to Netflix or Paramount, if a deal goes through, according to the filing.\n\nThe good times are poised to continue: Media and telecoms M&A deal value rose 61% in the past year, excluding the announced WBD sale, and the momentum should keep going in the years ahead, helped by investor appetite for valuable IP, according to PwC.\n\nThe Ellisons wanted to use $24 billion from Middle Eastern sources to fund their bid. That would seem to raise a whole host of concerns, not the least of which is that they'd be buying CNN and some of that money would come from Saudi Arabia's government, which US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018.\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka noted, however, that the issues WBD says the foreign money raised were \"presented as technical hurdles\" in the filing and \"not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\"\n\nA big question around the dueling bids was which company would have a better chance of surviving regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBoth Paramount and Netflix made their cases, arguing that they'd sail through the process, while the other bidder would encounter issues.\n\nParamount said a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the well-stocked Warner Bros. library. Netflix, for its part, has argued that a combination of Paramount and WBD would actually be larger than its own proposed new entity, as measured by total US TV viewing time.\n\nNone of this seemed to be a chief concern for the WBD board, though.\n\n\"The WBD Board further took into account advice of WBD's regulatory advisors that regulatory risk was not a material differentiating factor between\" the Paramount and Netflix proposals, the filing said.\n\nThe wild card is Trump, though, who has close ties to the Ellisons but hasn't come down firmly on either side publicly.",

    "fullText": "Curious just how much time you're spending on LinkedIn?\n\nWell, now you can find out how many days out of the 365-day calendar year you're logging in — among other stats — from LinkedIn's \"Year in Review\" feature.\n\nMicrosoft-owned LinkedIn is one of many platforms following in Spotify's footsteps with a personalized end-of-year recap of users' data. This year, several companies joined in on the Spotify Wrapped fun, including YouTube and Uber Eats (shortly following an SNL spoof).\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago, I wrote a wish list of what other apps I wanted \"wrapped.\" LinkedIn was one of them.\n\nThank you for fulfilling my data-hungry dreams, Microsoft!\n\n(TikTok, Instagram, and dating apps, there's still time to deliver us with more wrapped experiences.)\n\n\"Year in Review gives members a new way to reflect on how they learned, connected, and grew in 2025,\" LinkedIn editor in chief Dan Roth said in a statement. \"It's a fun way to look back on the year and celebrate milestones like new jobs, skills, and moments of professional growth.\"\n\nOpen LinkedIn, and at the top of the homepage on the LinkedIn mobile app, you should see a pop-up inviting you to view your \"Year in Review.\"\n\nIf not, head over to your notifications tab, where there should be another reminder to \"look back at your 2025 on LinkedIn.\" Or search directly for the feature in the app's search bar.\n\nThe feature summarizes data points in several slides, including the year you joined LinkedIn, how frequently you use the platform, any job changes, and your LinkedIn engagement and performance metrics throughout the year.\n\nI do think the team missed a golden naming opportunity, however, to name the recap feature your \"LinkedIn Annual Performance Review.\"\n\nI'd also like to know who my top profile viewers were. C'mon, we know you can do it.\n\nI spent 281 days on LinkedIn, according to my own LinkedIn recap.\n\nThat's about 77% of the calendar year. And that definitely includes several weekends.\n\nThe feature also takes you down a memory lane of LinkedIn connections, reminding you of when you joined the professional networking platform and who your first connection was. (I joined in 2017, and my first connection was a peer from college.)\n\nMeanwhile, my connections are scoring hot jobs in AI. LinkedIn told me that 588 of my connections \"were on the move\" and landed at companies like OpenAI, Stealth Startup, and Stealth AI Startup. As a reporter covering tech, that's … not surprising given the heated talent wars happening in AI and the cacophony of new AI startups launching.\n\nIf you wanted an ego boost (or buzzkill), LinkedIn also recaps some of your engagement metrics, such as new followers, comments, reactions, and profile views (if you pay for LinkedIn Premium).\n\nPremium users also get to see their top searches and most-used premium features.\n\nThe cheekier features include a title summarizing what \"you embodied\" on LinkedIn. For me — and at least three other Business Insider peers of mine — it was a \"catalyst.\" This, according to LinkedIn, means that \"you put your ideas out there and got people talking, sparking fresh perspectives.\"\n\nLinkedInfluencer career, here I come.",

    "fullText": "Howard \"Howie\" Rubin, a once-prominent Salomon Brothers investment banker featured in the 1985 Wall Street expose \"Liar's Poker,\" must remain in a federal jail in Brooklyn indefinitely as he fights sex-trafficking charges, a judge ruled on Wednesday.\n\nIt was the third bail denial for Rubin, accused of paying women, many of them former Playboy models, $5,000 to engage in \"fetish play,\" then constraining and torturing them, including by electrocuting them against their will.\n\nMagistrate Judge Peggy Kuo said her main concern is the risk that the wealthy financier, who has a $70 million account based in the Cayman Islands, would flee the country.\n\n\"The thing that is troubling me is I don't know if I can trust Mr. Rubin,\" Kuo said in denying bail. She said she has no way of knowing for certain if Rubin is mulling, \"What does my life look like if I flee, and what does it look like if I stay?\"\n\nRubin's 10-count indictment alleges a series of attacks against 10 Jane Does between 2009 and 2019 in luxury hotels and a soundproofed bedroom \"sex dungeon\" at his Manhattan penthouse apartment.\n\nRubin, 70, of Fairfield, Connecticut, pleaded not guilty and has been held without bail since his arrest in September. Rubin was once considered one of Wall Street's most skilled and aggressive traders of complex mortgage securities, earning him roles at influential firms like Merrill Lynch and Soros Fund Management.\n\nIn his latest bid for freedom, his lawyers had offered a $70 million bond, co-signed by family members. They include his wife, who has been divorcing him since 2021, and who wrote a letter to the judge extolling his devotion to three young grandchildren, who call him \"Pops.\"\n\n\"There is no allegation that Mr. Rubin engaged in any BDSM activity since 2019,\" his lawyers wrote in bail arguments filed Tuesday. \"He has been living in Connecticut for years, devoted to the care of his grandchildren,\" they wrote.\n\nFederal prosecutors countered that no amount of bail or electronic monitoring could guarantee Rubin's return to court; they also say that he has used threats and coercion to silence his accusers, allegations Rubin denies.\n\nRubin's former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, has been charged with pocketing millions of dollars to arrange the encounters; she has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges and is free on $850,000 bail.\n\nHer husband, Stephen Powers, is free on $250,000, according to court records. Both Powers have pleaded not guilty to bank and tax fraud in connection with the encounters.\n\nThree attorneys for Rubin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nRubin is due back in court on January 15. If convicted of the top sex trafficking charge, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and as much as life in prison.",

    "description": "\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer told Business Insider. The deal would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, he said.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is the prospective tenant that withdrew funding from Fermi America's massive data-center project, sending the developer's stock plummeting earlier this month, Business Insider has learned.\n\nIn September, Fermi, which is developing an 11-gigawatt data-center campus in the Texas Panhandle, said it had agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with an investment-grade tenant to anchor the project. The tenant would take the first gigawatt of power across 12 facilities.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, Fermi's stock plunged by nearly half after a securities filing said an unnamed prospective partner had canceled a $150 million advance to begin construction, known as an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, or AICA. The cancellation followed the end of an exclusivity period.\n\nAmazon is that tenant, Toby Neugebauer, Fermi's billionaire CEO, confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider, discussing the talks that led to the cancellation. The tech giant has been negotiating the deal, which would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, Neugebauer said.\n\n\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Neugebauer said.\n\nNeugebauer said the talks between Fermi and the tenant remain constructive, and that the ending of the AICA didn't indicate any breakdown in conversation.\n\n\"It's just a normal negotiation,\" he said. \"Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.\"\n\nNeugebauer said he wasn't worried about the talks taking too long. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"Big deals take longer.\"\n\nLisa Levandowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nFermi America's Panhandle project ranks among the most ambitious attempts yet to meet the surging energy demands of the data centers fueling the AI boom. The company intends to bring 11 gigawatts of new power online over the next decade-plus with a mix of power from the grid, natural gas, and nuclear sources.\n\nThe company went public in September, pricing its shares at $21 to raise more than $680 million.\n\nDubbed Project Matador, the development relies on a 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System. That agreement is dependent on a signed letter of intent between Fermi America and a tenant.\n\nThe December 12 filing said that none of the $150 million construction advance had been used and that the negotiations were ongoing. The letter of intent remains in force.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note published December 12 that they had spoken to Fermi America's management and learned that, per the company, the anchor tenant \"tried to make last-minute changes to the agreement pricing that were unacceptable to\" Fermi.\n\nAmazon is the second company to be linked to the project. In October, Neugebauer told the Amarillo City Council that Palantir, the software company known for its police and government contracts, had taken an interest in the site.\n\n\"I just finished with Palantir, which is our nation's tip of the spear in the AI war,\" Neugebauer said during the October 28 meeting. \"They'll be here Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said in their note that management indicated that they were \"active\" with two additional tenants, and in dialogue with another four.\n\nFermi America was founded less than a year ago by Neugebauer, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Perry's son Griffin. The IPO valued the company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nA recent slump in the company's shares has brought its valuation to below $6 billion.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "PayPal impersonators are at it again.",
    "fullText": "Another PayPal phishing scam is circulating, this time with email notifications about recurring or automatic payments. The messages originate from a legitimate PayPal address, allowing them to evade some security filters and leave recipients worried that their accounts have been compromised—perhaps just enough to ignore the obvious red flags and call or email scammers back.\n\nI personally have been targeted by this scam with at least five separate emails, though all have gone straight to my spam folder. Here's how scammers are exploiting PayPal settings to land in your inbox.\n\nIf you're targeted by this campaign, you may receive an email with the subject line \"Your automatic payment status has changed\" or \"Recurring Payment Reactivated.\" The layout imitates a real PayPal notification and includes a message about a high-dollar payment being \"successfully processed\" along with a customer service email and phone number to contact PayPal support.\n\nThe email is full of red flags: It is addressed to a random name (or, in one of the messages I received, \"Hello Update Invoice\"), has poor spelling and wonky formatting, and simply doesn't make sense. You can easily spot oddities like bold text and Unicode characters, which BleepingComputer notes is a trick used to bypass spam filters and keyword detection.\n\nWhere the trick lies is in the sender field, as the email comes from service[at]paypal[dot]com, a legitimate PayPal address, and paypal.com is in the signed-by field. As Malwarebytes Labs describes, this is likely an abuse of PayPal's subscription billing feature. If a merchant pauses a customer subscription, the user will receive an automatic email from PayPal notifying them that their payment is no longer active. Scammers are likely setting up fake subscriber accounts using Google Workspace mailing lists, so automatic emails being generated are sent to everyone on those lists. If you look at the \"To:\" field, you'll see that the message isn't actually addressed to your email.\n\nExploiting these types of loopholes to make phishing emails seem legit is a common tactic, and I've covered several similar PayPal phishing campaigns already this year. According to a statement provided to BleepingComputer, PayPal is working on mitigating this specific flaw.\n\nIf one of these PayPal messages lands in your inbox, don't engage with it. Scammers frequently use emails, texts, and calls about account security and financial transactions to scare you into action, and the impersonation of trusted institutions is often pretty convincing.\n\nIf you are concerned about activity on your PayPal account, go directly to the app or website and log in to view alerts and check transactions. Do not use contact information or click any links in the original notification, as this increases the chances of compromising your information or downloading malware to your device.",

    "title": "Apple Just Changed the Way You AirDrop With Strangers",
    "description": "AirDrop codes makes things a bit more secure and convenient.",
    "fullText": "AirDrop is one of Apple's best features. I use it on a daily basis to share files between my various Apple devices, but it really shines when I'm sharing stuff with other people, or vice versa. It can be tricky to find a quick solution to send larger files. Emails have too low a file size limit, chat apps can compress files, and cloud storage can fill up fast, but AirDrop is simple, built-in, and reliable. It even works with Android now, albeit just the Pixel 10.\n\nIf AirDrop has one flaw, it's that it's not particularly easy to use with strangers. Apple has changed how this side of AirDrop works over the years. For the longest time, you had two AirDrop settings: \"Contacts Only,\" which only lets your saved contacts find your device for AirDropping files, and \"Everyone,\" which leaves your AirDrop open to anyone with an iPhone to send you stuff. This was convenient when you needed to share files with strangers, but inconvenient if you left it on: Anyone with an iPhone could see your iPhone and send you anything—like, say, a bomb threat while on an airplane. Not good.\n\nThen, Apple changed this latter functionality to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" Ever since, if you want to open up your AirDrop to people outside your contacts, you have to manually enable this toggle, which will only stay open for, well, 10 minutes. After that, it switches back to \"Contacts Only.\" That's an improvement in security, but not in convenience. If you're ever in a situation where you need to AirDrop something to someone relatively frequently but you don't want to add their contact to your iPhone, you'll be switching back to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes\" every 10 minutes.\n\niOS 26.2, Apple's newest iPhone update at the time of this writing, introduces a solution—AirDrop codes. This feature forces anyone not saved in your contacts who wants to share something with you via AirDrop to ask for a one-time code first. Once you share that code, that user is temporarily saved on your iPhone for 30 days, allowing you to AirDrop repeatedly without issue. After those 30 days are up, the user leaves your iPhone, and you don't need to worry about pruning your Contacts app down the line. (This same functionality also applies to AirDrop on iPadOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2.)\n\nHere's how this new AirDrop experience works with strangers going forward. Let's say you're at a conference and you meet someone who wants to send you some relevant materials via AirDrop. You set your AirDrop settings to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes,\" they see your contact, and attempt to send you the file.\n\nOn your end, you see the request, with a \"Continue\" option: Once you tap it, you'll see the AirDrop code on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can tell the code to the sender, who can enter it on their device. If successful, the file will be shared like any other AirDrop interaction.\n\nAs stated above, this allows you to AirDrop with this contact for 30 days without needing to bother with another AirDrop code. But if you're done sharing with the stranger for good, you can remove their temporary contact early. Head to the Contacts app, hit the back button in the top left if applicable to head to Lists, then choose Other Known. Here, you'll see any temporary contacts generated from previous AirDrop sessions, which you can delete ahead of that 30 day deadline. Otherwise, your device will take care of it once that timeframe has elapsed.",

    "title": "Gemini 3 Flash Outperforms Gemini 3 Pro and GPT 5.2 In These Key Benchmarks",
    "description": "Small, yet mighty.",
    "fullText": "The AI wars continue to heat up. Just weeks after OpenAI declared a \"code red\" in its race against Google, the latter released its latest lightweight model: Gemini 3 Flash. This particular Flash is the latest in Google's Gemini 3 family, which started with Gemini 3 Pro, and Gemini 3 Deep Think. But while this latest model is meant to be a lighter, less expensive variant of the existing Gemini 3 models, Gemini 3 Flash is actually quite powerful in its own right. In fact, it beats out both Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5.2 models in some benchmarks.\n\nLightweight models are typically meant for more basic queries, for lower-budget requests, or to be run on lower-powered hardware. That means they're often faster than more powerful models that take longer to process, but can do more. According to Google, Gemini 3 Flash combines the best of both those worlds, producing a model with Gemini 3's \"Pro-grade reasoning,\" with \"Flash-level latency, efficiency, and cost.\" While that likely matters most to developers, general users should also notice the improvements, as Gemini 3 Flash is now the default for both Gemini (the chatbot) and AI Mode, Google's AI-powered search.\n\nYou can see these improvements in Google's reported benchmarking stats for Gemini 3 Flash. In Humanity's Last Exam, an academic reasoning benchmark that tests LLMs on 2,500 questions across over 100 subjects, Gemini 3 Flash scored 33.7% with no tools, and 43.5% with search and code execution. Compare that to Gemini 3 Pro's 37.5% and 45.8% scores, respectively, or OpenAI's GPT-5.2's scores of 34.5% and 45.5%. In MMMU-Pro, a benchmark that test a model's multimodal understanding and reasoning, Gemini 3 Flash got the top score (81.2%), compared to Gemini 3 Pro (81%) and GPT-5.2 (79.5). In fact, across the 21 benchmarking tests Google highlights in its announcement, Gemini 3 Flash has the top score in three: MMMU-Pro (tied with Gemini 3 Pro), Toolathlon, and MMMLU. Gemini 3 Pro still takes the number one spot on the most tests here (14), and GPT-5.2 topped eight tests, but Gemini 3 Flash is holding its own.\n\nGoogle notes that Gemini 3 Flash also outperforms both Gemini 3 Pro and the entire 2.5 series in the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, which tests the model's coding agent capabilities. Gemini 3 Flash scored a 78%, while Gemini 3 Pro scored 76.2%, Gemini 2.5 Flash scored 60.4%, and Gemini 2.5 Pro scored 59.6%. (Note that GPT-5.2 scored the best of the models Google mentions in this announcement.) It's a close race, especially when you consider this is a lightweight model scoring alongside these company's flagship models.\n\nThat might present an interesting dilemma for developers who pay to use AI models in their programs. Gemini 3 Flash costs $0.50 per every million input tokens (what you ask the model to do), and $3.00 per every million output tokens (the result the models returns from your prompt). Compare that to Gemini 3 Pro, which costs $2.00 per every million input tokens, and $12.00 per every million output tokens, or GPT-5.2's $3.00 and $15.00 costs, respectively. For what it's worth, it's not as cheap as Gemini 2.5 Flash ($0.30 and $2.50), or Grok 4.1 Fast for that matter ($0.20 and $0.50), but it does outperform these models in Google's reported benchmarks. Google notes that Gemini 3 Flash uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro, which will save on cost, while also being three times faster.\n\nIf you're someone who needs LLMs like Gemini 3 Flash to power your products, but you don't want to pay the higher costs associated with more powerful models, I could image this latest lightweight model looking appealing from a financial perspective.\n\nMost of us using AI aren't doing so as developers who need to worry about API pricing. The majority of Gemini users are likely experiencing the model through Google's consumer products, like Search, Workspace, and the Gemini app.\n\nStarting today, Gemini 3 Flash is the default model in the Gemini app. Google says it can handle many tasks \"in just a few seconds.\" That might include asking Gemini for tips on improving your golf swing based on a video of yourself, or uploading a speech on a given historical topic and requesting any facts you might have missed. You could also ask the bot to code you a functioning app from a series of thoughts.\n\nYou'll also experience Gemini 3 Flash in Google Search's AI Mode. Google says the new model is better at \"parsing the nuances of your question,\" and thinks through each part of your request. AI Mode tries to return a more complete search result by scanning hundreds of sites at once, and putting together a summary with sources for your answer. We'll have to see if Gemini 3 Flash improves on previous iterations of AI Mode.\n\nI'm someone who still doesn't find much use for generative AI products in their day-to-day lives, and I'm not entirely sure Gemini 3 Flash is going to change that for me. However, the balance of performance gains with the cost to process that power is interesting, and I'm particularly intrigued to see how OpenAI responds.\n\nGemini 3 Flash is available to all users starting today. In addition to general users in Gemini and AI Mode, developers will find it in the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, and Google Antigravity, the company's new agentic development platform. Enterprise users can use it in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.",

Gaming continued to take most of the top spots, as fans spent more time in interactive worlds that are constantly updated, like Minecraft and Terraria. In film and TV, long-running franchises like Star Wars and Marvel stayed near the top thanks to new releases like Andor and Thunderbolts.\n\nThe rankings were determined using Fandom's franchise factor score, which combines five things: worldbuilding, strong reviews, loyal fans, cultural impact, and consistency. It uses Fandom's large fan data to give a full picture of how popular and important a franchise is in entertainment and gaming.\n\nAnime also had a big year in large part because of high-profile films and celebrations. Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle brought huge attention as it moved the series toward its finale, while Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc kept momentum high between seasons. There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.\n\nThe rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.\n\nThe same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention.",

    "fullText": "Over the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",
