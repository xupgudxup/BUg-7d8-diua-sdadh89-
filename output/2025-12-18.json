Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nShould the Cleveland Browns lose their remaining three games, it will mark the second consecutive season in which they finished 3-14, meaning head coach Kevin Stefanski could certainly be on his way out.\n\nShould the Browns decide to fire the two-time Coach of the Year, there are several names they could explore to make their next head coach. Brian Flores, Jesse Minter, and Chris Shula are all names to keep an eye on around the NFL. However, NFL insider Josina Anderson reports that there are multiple people in the Browns organization that would be interested in bringing in Bill Belichick.\n\n\"I'm told there's been recent interest expressed, at the very least, in speaking with Bill Belichick on a exploratory basis from two teams , per league source,\" Anderson reports on X. \"My understanding is Belichick has upper-level personnel still fond of him in Atlanta, New York, Cleveland, whilst all struggling teams going through customary evaluations this time of year.\"\n\nBelichick was the head coach of the Browns from 1991-95 before he was fired and the team moved to Baltimore. He then went to New England to join his former boss, Bill Parcells, as the Patriots' assistant head coach and defensive backs coach before leaving with Parcells and going to the New York Jets from 1997-99. When Parcells stepped down as head coach, Belichick was named the new head coach before infamously resigning and going back to New England, going on to win six Super Bowls. He is currently the head coach at the University of North Carolina.\n\nJ.J.

    "description": "Mahomes had surgery on Monday to repair two torn ligaments in his left knee",
    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs officials said Patrick Mahomes is already starting rehab on his knee\n\nThe quarterback underwent surgery two days earlier to repair his ACL and LCL\n\nMahomes tore two ligaments in his left knee on the final drive of the Chiefs' playoff-eliminating loss Sunday\n\nKansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has already begun rehabbing his left knee after undergoing surgery to repair the two torn ligaments he suffered in Sunday’s loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nTeam officials shared Mahomes' rehab news on Wednesday, Dec. 17, roughly 48 hours after the 30-year-old NFL star had the procedure done in Dallas.\n\nMahomes tore two ligaments — his ACL and his LCL — on a play late in the game, while the Chiefs were attempting to score on their final drive and save their season. After Mahomes was helped off the field, Kansas City failed to score and was mathematically eliminated from the NFL Playoffs for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nThe Chiefs' vice president of sports medicine and performance, Rick Burkholder, told reporters on Wednesday that the “ballpark” estimation for Mahomes’ recovery window is roughly “nine months,” meaning the three-time Super Bowl MVP is aiming to return for Week 1 of the 2026 NFL season.\n\n\"Every player is different. Every sport is different. Every position is different,\" Burkholder said, according to ESPN, adding that Mahomes “is so in tune to what he does, he does it a little quicker.”\n\n“Ballpark on this is nine months, but it could be a month or two more, a month or two less,” Burkholder added.\n\nThe 2026 NFL season is expected to kick off the week of Sept. 10, according to ESPN.\n\nBurkholder told reporters he expects Mahomes will be extremely focused on his rehab in the coming months: “I think you guys know, as a player, his mindset is a little different than most,\" the Chiefs medical official said.\n\n\"He's so regimented in what he does,” Burkholder added. “He's in here at 6 a.m. He's the last guy out at night. He'll take the rehab like that. When you add up all the little things, that allows the player to get back faster. They don't heal up faster, they just get back to performance faster.\"\n\nChiefs head coach Andy Reid also told reporters Wednesday that Mahomes seems “so positive” after Monday’s surgery.\n\n“He attacked this thing the day of,” Mahomes’ longtime coach said. “You wouldn't expect anything less. 'Get me up, get me going,' he's basically saying, an hour after the game. 'Brace me up and let me go.' It's not one of those injuries, obviously, but that's his mindset. I think he'll do great with the rehab. He's a pretty fast healer that way. And his attitude is 90% of things, how you go about it. How you're willing to push through the pain to get right.\"\n\nReid told reporters Monday that Mahomes was \"in a good place\" following the season-ending injury, but said the two-time NFL MVP \"feels like he let people down.”\n\nMahomes has not spoken with reporters since the injury, but shared a message on social media underscoring his determination to get healthy and back on the field to start next season.\n\n“Don’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie, it hurts,” Mahomes posted. “But all we can do now is trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.”\n\nMahomes added: “Thank you, Chiefs kingdom, for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever ⏰.”",

    "fullText": "After a whole month of controversy with former head coach Lane Kiffin, the Ole Miss Rebels are finally back on the playing field, hoping to continue the best season in program history.\n\nThey face a familiar matchup this weekend against a Tulane team that they blew out 45-10 earlier this year, and should cruise through their first round College Football Playoff game on Saturday.\n\nThey’re a significant favorite and deservedly so. They outgained the Green Wave by nearly 250 yards in the first matchup, while completely shutting down their passing attack. Offensively, Trinidad Chambliss and Co. were dominant, throwing for over 300 yards while getting 241 more on the ground.\n\nOle Miss scored on eight of its first nine possessions, and Tulane just had no answers defensively. But, the blowout win did show a glaring concern: Ole Miss’s run defense.\n\nThe Rebels could not contain the Tulane ground game, as the Green Wave went for 178 yards on 4.6 yards per carry. And that wasn’t a one-game problem.\n\nAfter being a dominant force up front in 2024, ranking first in rushing yards allowed per game (85.1) and in yards allowed per carry (2.4), Ole Miss has significantly slipped this season. They rank 71st in rushing yards allowed per game (157.1), while being 92nd in yards allowed per carry (4.7).\n\nNow, the issue hasn’t shown up as much this year because Ole Miss’s offense has been elite, and the pass defense has been a top-30 unit in the country this year.\n\nBut, in Ole Miss’s close games this season, they struggled to defend the run. Against Kentucky early in the year, they allowed 172 rushing yards and 4.6 yards per carry. Arkansas went for 221 yards and four scores on six yards per carry in Ole Miss’s 41-35 win. Washington State had 127 yards on 4.5 yards a carry. Oklahoma went for 136 yards and two scores on nearly five yards a carry.\n\nThen, there’s Georgia, who went for 221 yards and a touchdown on the ground in Ole Miss’s lone loss of the year. And that’s who the Rebels will play in the second round of the Playoff, assuming they beat Tulane.\n\nNow, the Rebels are still a stellar 11-1 in the SEC. They’ve managed to win behind that elite defense and good pass defense. And they should run through Tulane this weekend, whose defense can’t keep up with Ole Miss.\n\nBut, if there’s a reason why Ole Miss’s magical season might end earlier than fans hope, it’s the run defense, which can certainly be a prevalent issue against the top teams in the country.",

    "fullText": "Netflix has signed ESPN’s Elle Duncan as its first sports anchor. As part of her multiyear deal, she will lead on-air coverage for Netflix Sports across the streamer’s diverse portfolio of growing sports coverage.\n\nHer first on-air hosting gig will be in early 2026 with “Skyscraper Live,” where free solo climber Alex Honnold will attempt to scale Taipei 101, the tallest building in Taiwan.\n\n“Joining Netflix feels like being invited to an already legendary party and somehow getting handed the aux cord!” Duncan said. “For a lifelong utility player, a multisport assignment is a full-circle moment, and being trusted with something this one-of-a-kind feels incredibly special and surreal. I’m bringing boundless energy, storytelling and bad puns no one asked for but will be subjected to anyway.”\n\n“Also, I was told this fast-tracks my kids to meeting the KPop Demon Hunters, so … win-win,” she added.\n\nDuncan comes from ESPN, known for her work on “SportsCenter,” “College GameDay” and “WNBA Countdown.” She specifically covered college and professional basketball, hosting “College GameDay” for women’s basketball across the country.\n\nNetflix has expanded its sports portfolio signing deals with the NFL, MLB, the Women’s World Cup, WWE, FIFA and more, so Duncan’s coverage slate will be diverse.\n\n“Elle Duncan’s proven ability to seamlessly move between hard-hitting sports analysis and warm, personality-driven cultural hosting makes her a perfect fit at Netflix,” Gabe Spitzer, vice president of sports at Netflix, said. “She immediately adds credibility and familiar star power to our global programming slate.”\n\nThe television host started her career in Atlanta, as an anchor for NESN and spending six years as an Atlanta Hawks sideline reporter. She joined ESPN in 2016, where she hosted the 6 p.m. ET edition of “SportsCenter” and held key roles across college and professional basketball. Her final “SportsCenter” appearance was Tuesday.\n\nThe post Netflix Taps ESPN’s Elle Duncan as First Sports Anchor in Multiyear Deal appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich is apparently very serious about acquiring Crystal Palace center-back Marc Guéhi:\n\nBayern held two meetings with the representatives of Marc Guéhi. The Englishman is a target for Bayern, but much will depend on what will happen with Dayot Upamecano. If the latter extends his contract, then Guéhi could look for a different solution. If Upa decides to leave, the Englishman would be a serious name for the club. At the moment, there are 4 clubs realistically in the conversation for Guéhi: Bayern, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nMadrid Universal captured more of Romano’s report, which details all of the elite clubs angling for the Crystal Palace defender:\n\nReal Madrid are very much in the race for the 25-year-old Crystal Palace captain, but face stiff competition from arch-rivals Barcelona, who have already made a call to the player’s camp asking for information.\n\nMoreover, Bayern Munich are also very much in the hunt and have already held two meetings with Guehi’s entourage to explore the possibility of a summer transfer. However, any move might depend on the future of Dayot Upamecano, with the Bayern Munich defender, another target for Real Madrid, still in negotiations over a contract renewal.\n\nFinally, Premier League champions Liverpool are also in the race to sign Guehi, having missed out on his capture late last summer. Recent reports from England have suggested that even Manchester City are considering a move for the former Chelsea prospect.\n\nAs reported, Bayern Munich’s entire focus on Guéhi could shift if Upamecano re-ups. However, there will also be a big possibility that Kim Min-jae will want to leave Bavaria next summer. If so, Bayern Munich could go deeper into its pursuit of Guéhi or begin looking more closely at Borussia Dortmund’s Nico Schlotterbeck as well.\n\nFC Köln youngster Said El Mala is on Bayern Munich’s radar, but Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United could be an impediment to the 19-year-old moving to Bavaria:\n\nThe Wednesday print edition of Germany’s Sport Bild tabloid reports that Manchester United and Tottenham have lodged concrete inquiries about 1. FC Köln starlet Said El Mala. The 19-year-old appears set to remain in the Bundesliga for the duration of the season, but the two Premier League outfits are prepared to start discussing a summer transfer. Both English clubs are interested in a purchase in the €30m to €40m range.\n\nIf you are so inclined, this might be of interest to you:\n\nFC Barcelona could be eyeing Inter Milan center-back Alessandro Bastoni:\n\nBarcelona have made an enquiry regarding Internazionale center back Alessandro Bastoni, according to Matteo Moretto. It is reported that Barca’s sporting director Deco recently travelled to Milan to discuss a potential move for the 26-year old, with the Blaugrana keen to sign the Italy defender due to uncertainty over the situation of Ronald Araújo, who is currently taking a mental health break. A January deal is expected to be difficult to secure, but the LaLiga side are exploring alternatives, with Aston Villa defender Pau Torres also on their shortlist, according to ESPN sources.\n\nBastoni had been linked to Bayern Munich in the past, but has not been mentioned to be on the club’s radar for quite a while.\n\nOn Wednesday, we saw that Inter Miami might have interest in FC Barcelona striker and former Bayern Munich star Robert Lewandowski, but for that to happen, Lionel Messi will have to outmaneuver the Chicago Fire, who hold Lewandowski’s discovery rights:\n\nThe Chicago Fire have held talks with Barcelona’s 39-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski over a move to MLS, says the BBC. Lewandowski is out of contract in the summer and has shown a desire to play in America before he retires.\n\nBorussia Dortmund looks to be close to re-upping both Emre Can and Julian Brandt:\n\n⚫️🟡 Borussia Dortmund are close to finalising the contract extensions of Emre Can and Julian Brandt. (Sport Bild)\n\nThe pair will be extend until 2028, and there will be little change in their current salary\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "title": "Against Anthony Joshua, Jake Paul finds himself on the other side of the extreme",
    "description": "Not sure if this is the most courageous act Paul has done, or the most foolish, but the answer is yes. It’s all those things.",
    "fullText": "Honestly, you’d expect there to be a little more buzz for Friday night, given the set up.\n\nJake Paul, who has feasted on a steady diet of off-center beatables for the length of his boxing career, is facing off with the kind of fighter everyone has been demanding he face since he began. Anthony Joshua is 6-foot-6. He hits like a heavyweight because that’s what he is. He weighs 250 pounds. If you saw his destruction of Francis Ngannou, you know he’s the kind of boxer who cleanses people of their delusions. He’s elite by boxing’s standards, not on the freakshow curve Jake Paul is used to. There isn’t any kind of wink or nudge in play with AJ, and when he says, “if I can kill you, I’ll kill you,” it’s a clear message that he’s not messing around.\n\nFor the longest time, people have dared Paul — boxing’s greatest interloper — to fight someone his own age. His own weight. His own sport. Somebody who doesn’t carry an asterisk to the ring, as the 57-year-old Mike Tyson did, or the scars from a recent hip replacement surgery, as Ben Askren did. Somebody who has been in boxing longer than he has, which Tyron Woodley and Anderson Silva hadn’t. Somebody not shot or linked to drug cartels, like Julio César Chávez Jr.\n\nWhen Paul faced off with Gervonta Davis, the Big Boxing Brand who was originally scheduled to be his next opponent, “Tank” looked like he needed at least six more years of growth before he’d ever fit into his clothes. If that weren’t bad enough, Davis’ powerful indifference became that of the public at large, which is never a good sign for a fight.\n\nYet each time Paul faces off with Joshua, as he did once again on Wednesday in Miami, the scribes begin penning his obituary. Chael Sonnen calls it the “biggest mismatch in sport in my lifetime.” If anything, the spirit of bullydom switched hosts. If you were worried about Mike Tyson getting hurt fighting a young, powerful puncher, this time the worry is that the masquerade had gone too far. Listen, Jake, when we said fight a real boxer, we didn’t mean a heavyweight who can send your head into the mezzanine.\n\nWhat is he doing? When you look at Paul’s trajectory, it’s been one of gradual and at times comical escalation, a careful management of risk. Going from Askren to Woodley was going from a collegiate wrestler with no striking to a collegiate wrestler with decent striking, was a subtle level-up. Neither were boxers. Then to Anderson Silva, who was 47, yes, but at least better striker. The loss to Tommy Fury was a sad affair, and nobody thinks about the Nate Diaz match, as it underwhelmed so drastically.\n\nThe line between a publicity stunt and a fair, competitive fight has been a hard one to navigate through Paul’s run in the boxing ring.\n\nAnd really, the boxers Paul beat most recently — the elder Tyson and Chavez Jr. — only made the cries for him to fight a relevant boxer of this era all the louder. But to fight Joshua? Just because you were in a pinch to fulfill a Netflix date after Tank was ousted for criminal behavior? This is the other end of the extreme.\n\nNot sure if this is the most courageous act he’s done, or the most foolish, but the answer is yes. It’s all those things.\n\nThe spectacle alone is enough for alarm. Paul, the self-professed “face of boxing,” comes eye level with Joshua’s gold necklace when they face off. If Paul sees himself as David taking on Goliath, that’s the new wrinkle, yet he still feels more like the cloven-hooved Pan. He held his belly out toward Joshua to give the visual the appropriate absurdity, yet seeing him standing there lampooning in front of such a specimen I had to think — how does he intend to beat Joshua?\n\nDoes he intend to? Does he believe he can? Or is this a kind of boxing finale that only an influencer-turned-mogul can appreciate? The great Final Act?\n\nSo much of the Jake Paul experience has felt like a detour into the wicked imagination. Nobody asked for it, yet the curiosity keeps us coming back. It’s true that he has brought eyeballs onto the sport of boxing, though purists might believe for all the wrong reasons, and that he has done more good than harm. He has advocated for women’s boxing unlike anyone else and made Amanda Serrano into a star. He has openly butted heads with the UFC’s Dana White, which from an MMA perspective can’t help but be a welcome thing. He has made himself relevant in a sport where relevance is hard to come by.\n\nSome like him, many can’t stand him. He’s a nuisance that everyone wants a part of.\n\nFor anyone who wants to see Paul get his ass handed to him, tune in Friday night, free with your Netflix subscription. Never has an outcome felt so certain. Joshua is far bigger, more powerful, vastly more skilled, and more seasoned. That this fight got sanctioned at all is a high wonder, yet that’s one of Paul’s specialties, presenting the kind of must-see competitive imbalance that will stop the gawker in his tracks.  And with Paul this time being the one with the impossible task, take a good look.\n\nBecause this one? This one feels a little like Paul is Bodhi in the original “Point Break,” paddling out against the towering wave during the elusive 50-year-storm, to catch one last ride before the whole thing comes crashing down.",

Philadelphia leads the NFC East division with a 9-5 (.643) record and currently holds the No. 3 seed in the conference playoff picture.\n\nThe Commanders will host the Eagles in Week 16 for the second consecutive season, and Washington is looking for back-to-back NFC East wins after defeating the New York Giants 29-21 in Week 15.\n\nWith kickoff fast approaching, here is a look at the storied history of games between these franchises, with key stats to know for Saturday afternoon.\n\nOverall: Washington has a 89-86-6 record against the Eagles.\n\nRandom note: Washington will try to win back-to-back home games against the Eagles for the first time since the 2015 and 2016 seasons.\n\nLast five matchups: The Eagles own a 7-2 (.778) record against the Commanders with NickSirianni at the helm (including playoffs), winning each of the last four games started and finished by Jalen Hurts.\n\nLast meeting: Philadelphia's previous meeting with Washington was in the 2024 NFC Championship Game at Lincoln Financial Field, when the Eagles set an NFL playoff record for points scored (W, 55-23) en route to Super Bowl LIX.\n\nIn Washington: At home, Washington has a 46-41-3 record against Philadelphia.\n\nLast meeting in Washington: Last season, the Commanders defeated the Eagles 36-33 on a last-second touchdown pass from QB Jayden Daniels to WR Jamison Crowder in Week 15.\n\nSince 2021 (including playoffs), Philadelphia is 41-2 (.953) when it wins the turnover battle, including a 7-0 mark in 2025.\n\nWashington has a 17-19 record on Saturdays. The last time Washington played on a Saturday was in 2022, when theyfaced off against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe Eagles' head coach is among the most outstanding winners in NFL history to start a career. Among Super Bowl-winning head coaches, only John Madden (.759, 1969-78) and Vince Lombardi (.738, 1959-67 and 69) have won at a greater clip than Nick Sirianni (.695, 57-25) (6th in NFL history).\n\nSirianni is one win away from tying Greasy Neale (64, 1941-50) for the 2nd-most by a head coach in Eagles history (including playoffs). Neale led the Eagles to the 1948 and 1949 NFL Championships.\n\nTake out the game against Chicago, and Vic Fangio very well could have the best unit in the NFL. Entering this matchup with Washington, Philadelphia has owned one of the NFL's best defenses since its bye week. Dating back to Week 10, the Eagles rank 1st in opponent completion percentage (51.5%) and fourth-down defense (14.3%); 2nd in opponent passer rating (67.2); 3rd in defensive points allowed per game (14.3), pressures (90), QB hits (45), yards allowed per pass (5.2) and FFs (5, tied); 4th in sacks (19); and 5th in takeaways (9, tied).\n\nThis season, Philadelphia has held opponents to the league's lowest completion percentage (56.0%). That is the Eagles’ best figure allowed through 14 contests since the 2008 campaign (53.9%). Philadelphia has surrendered just 13 passing TDs, which ranks 2nd in the NFL, trailing only L.A. Chargers (12). The Eagles remain the only NFL team that has not allowed a passing TD on third or fourth down (last NFL team to do so through 14 games was the 2008 Colts).\n\nThe Eagles rank 5th in the NFL in defensive EPA (70.9), behind Seattle (111.1), Houston (99.6), Cleveland (98.9), and L.A. Rams (74.8).\n\nCooper DeJean leads all slot CBs in run defense grade (83.0), passer rating allowed (61.7), and yards allowed per coverage snap (0.67) (min. 125 run defense snaps, 40 targets, and 250 coverage snaps). For his career, DeJean has never allowed a passing TD when in the slot.\n\nSince returning to the Eagles’ defense in Week 7, Nakobe Dean has recorded the highest PFF pass rush grade (92.3), pass rush win rate (30.0%), and pressure percentage (36.7%) among NFL off-ball LBs (min. 30 pass rush snaps). In that span, Dean, who is the first Eagle to have multiple strip-sacks since Haason Reddick in 2022, ranks 2nd among off-ball LBs with 4.0 sacks, behind Eric Wilson (5.0). He is also the only player with 50+ tackles (53), 4.0+ sacks, and 2+ FFs since Week 7.\n\nJalyx Hunt is one of only three NFL players with 20+ QB hits (20) and multiple takeaways (2 INTs) this year, joining Will Anderson and Aidan Hutchinson (the only player with 20+ QB hits and 2+ INTs). Since Week 10, Hunt ranks T-5th in the NFL in QB hits (10), behind Myles Garrett (17), Micah Parsons (12), Danielle Hunter (11), and Osa Odighizuwa (11).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Eagles vs. Commanders preview: 10 stats to know for Week 16",

    "description": "Wind is going to be a factor. So is the multiple defense coach Mike Macdonald will have against Sean McVay’s Rams offense.",
    "fullText": "Biggest game of the year. Biggest game yet for Sam Darnold with his Seahawks.\n\nWhat’s Seattle’s quarterback doing to prepare best for the Los Angeles Rams and this NFC West Battle Royale Thursday night at Lumen Field for the division lead and inside track to the top seed plus bye in next month’s conference playoffs?\n\n“To be honest, I’m not up all-night studying,” Darnold said of the three days between the Seahawks’ win over Indianapolis and this showdown between two 11-3 teams. “It’s making sure that I get my sleep, get my recovery in, because it is such a short week.”\n\nThere could be a lot for Darnold to study, in an effort to spring surprises on the Rams.\n\nYet Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald and offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak have spent this week balancing installing new plays in the game plan the Rams haven’t seen on film this season versus not overloading Seattle’s players with too much. The coaches want their Seahawks to play fast, to not think about too much new they crammed into the players’ heads Monday into Thursday this week. The Seahawks — and the Rams, for that matter — have been practicing plays for weeks if not months they’ve yet to use in a game, to surprise their opponent with new looks in the first Thursday night in NFL history feature two teams with 11 or more wins.\n\nThat’s the first key to this game: Be new, but while playing fast.\n\n“I think you could use it to your advantage,” Macdonald said of the short week. “If you’re decisive in how you want to operate and they’re the right decisions, I think that’ll help you. Sometimes, it might be behind the 8-ball.\n\n“A kick in the butt doesn’t necessarily hurt you.”\n\nSo what’s the new that will be key Thursday night?\n\nLook for Macdonald to use the combination of rookie Nick Emmanwori at all three levels of the defense with Pro Bowl cornerback Devon Witherspoon blitzing more and Seattle’s recent three-cornerback rotation with Riq Woolen and Josh Jobe giving the Seahawks new personnel options against coach Sean McVay’s Rams offense.\n\nNo team in the league plays in “13” personnel — one running back, three tight ends — more than McVay’s Rams, 25% of the time; the league average is 5%. No team played the Rams’ “13” personnel with nickel and an extra, fifth defensive back more than the Seahawks did last month in L.A.’s 21-19 home win.\n\nRams No. 2 wide receiver Davante Adams, the NFL’s leader with 14 touchdown receptions, is doubtful to play because of an injured hamstring. That may lead McVay to even more “13” personnel sets.\n\nThe Rams average 6.1 yards per play in their three-tight ends formations this season. Against Macdonald’s Seahawks last month L.A. got just 2.7 yards in McVay’s “13” personnel.\n\nIn all formations, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had by one measure the worst game of his 17-year NFL career last month against Seattle. His expected points added (EPA) passing in that game was the lowest of his career.\n\nMcVay’s offense had its lowest EPA in two seasons last month against Macdonald’s Seahawks defense. Can Seattle do it again?\n\nThe weather is forecast to be conducive to running over throwing the ball: A 50% chance of rain with winds 15 mph gusting toward 35 mph around the 5:15 p.m. kickoff, then throughout the game.\n\n“Yeah, it’ll factor into some of the decisions that we make,” Macdonald said, grinning to conceal exactly which ones.\n\nKubiak has shown he’s going to run the ball, regardless of the results. Seattle gained just 49 yards last week against the Colts, a top-10 run defense in the NFL. Yet the Seahawks ran it 22 times. No team in the league comes close to running it as often as Seattle’s 48% of all offensive plays. Yet the Seahawks are fifth-to-last with just 3.9 yards per rush.\n\nLast week, they ran for a season low 2.3 yards per carry against Indianapolis.\n\nThe Rams are ninth in the league in rushing defense.\n\n“I think it’s got to improve pretty quick,” Kubiak said of the Seahawks running game.\n\n“We’ve got to move the ball better on the ground. We’ve got to coach better. We’ve got to block better. We’ve got to help the operation by being a more balanced team.”\n\nExpect a pointed effort by Kubiak handing the ball to lead back Kenneth Walker early and often. Walker had 2.4 yards per rush in the last two games (19 carries, 46 yards). He’s had defenders standing waiting for him in the backfield immediately as he receives handoffs from Darnold.\n\nThursday, Walker is going to be running behind a new left tackle: Josh Jones is making his first Seattle start, for injured Charles Cross.\n\nThe Seahawks drove inside the Rams’ 20-yard line four times in that November game in Inglewood, California. They got just one touchdown out of those four red-zone trips.\n\nLast week against the Colts the Seahawks were 0 for 2 scoring TDs in the red zone. Seattle’s offensive moved inside the Indianapolis 35 four times. Yet the only offense was a team-record six field goals by Jason Myers in the 18-16 escape win.\n\nFor the season, the Seahawks are in the bottom half of the NFL, 17th in the 32-team league, in red-zone TD percentage (57.5%). They’ve been just 37.5% the last three weeks, the fourth-worst in the NFL in that span.\n\nMinimize penalties. Eliminate negative plays. And of course be far better than the career-high four interceptions Darnold threw in the last game against the Rams, handing L.A. two of their three touchdowns.\n\nThe Seahawks must score touchdowns, seven points, instead of field goals when they get close against L.A.\n\n“Again, the last few games moving the ball up and down the field, I feel like we’ve been solid,” Darnold said. “Third downs can improve a little bit— or a lot, I think I should say. Then in the red zone, it’s a matter of keeping the ball moving forward.\n\n“When you get in those second and long, third and longs, that makes it hard to convert. So, just keeping the ball moving forward, not only in the red zone, but also in the field, as well.”\n\nYes, this is one of the biggest regular-season games Seattle’s played in a minute. The winner is two more wins from the NFC West title and home-field plus a bye in the conference playoffs, meaning two home postseason games from the Super Bowl. The loser is headed to the fifth seed, and needing to win three road playoff games to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nYet the Seahawks coach doesn’t see it in that lens.\n\n“Look, I get it. It’s your job to put all the meaning behind it,” Macdonald said.\n\n“It’s our job to go play great football.\n\n“It’s all good, and I get it. It’s exciting. But every game’s exciting.” Darnold doesn’t turn the ball over. Walker gets (some) more than he’s gotten recently on the ground. Macdonald’s defense again stymies McVay’s offense with new tricks.",

    "fullText": "There's no need to mince words. Thursday night's matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks has massive NFC playoff implications. The winner of said game will likely have the inside track to the conference's No. 1 seed throughout the postseason next month, which obviously means guaranteed homefield advantage and the sole bye week available.\n\nUnfortunately for the Rams, who beat the Seahawks at home earlier this season, they will have to overcome their NFC West rival on the road without one of their best players.\n\nVeteran star receiver Davante Adams is likely to miss Thursday's game with a left hamstring injury. It's a reaggravation of the same injury Adams suffered earlier this season. The Rams apparently don't believe Adams' injury is of a long-term variety. He could theoretically return as soon as next week. But with the postseason around the corner, they're rightfully proceeding with caution so one of their top playmakers is healthy and can play in the biggest games.\n\nEven still, a road game against the team nipping at your heels in the NFC and NFC West is probably the worst game to miss. Alas, the Rams are definitely more equipped than most to survive without Adams for at least one week:\n\nRams are listing WR Davante Adams as doubtful for Thursday night’s game in Seattle due to his hamstring injury. pic.twitter.com/pDs8Tx533A\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) December 17, 2025\n\nWe'll see how the Rams fare without Adams, who leads the team in touchdowns (14) and is second in both catches and receiving yards.\n\nJordan Whittington is listed as Adams' backup on the Rams' depth chart.

    "fullText": "Welcome to week 15 of the Cyclone tracker!\n\nThis is where we follow our resident weather-themed duo in rookie receivers Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel, both out of Iowa State (hence, the “Cyclone” twins).\n\nAs always, there will be analysis, projections, commentary, and relevant updates that happen in real time.\n\nProjected Week 15 storm path: 5.0 targets, 3.0 receptions, 25.5 yards, 0.1 TD, 5.5 fantasy points\n\nActual Week 15 path: 1 target, 1 reception, 4 yards (4.0 avg.), 0 TDs, 1.4 fantasy pts\n\nTotal stats through Week 15: 56 targets, 36 receptions, 397 yards (11.0 avg.), 4 TDs, 99.7 fantasy pts\n\nAnalysis: It was a relatively quiet Sunday afternoon for the former Iowa State Cyclone, as Jayden Higgins found himself with only one target for four yards in the Texans’ 40-20 win over the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nHiggins had been on a five-game streak of at least 3+ catches, dating back to week 10’s 36-29 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

    "description": "Albon thinks his Williams Formula 1 team has now laid the foundations to start bridging the gap to the top teams",
    "fullText": "Williams Formula 1 driver Alex Albon says he has \"so much confidence\" his team can take another step forward after its rise to fifth in 2025.\n\nWilliams secured a comfortable fifth place in last season's championship as the experienced and rapid combination of Albon and new team-mate Carlos Sainz combined for 137 points,- the Grove-based squad's best result in a decade.\n\nEven if the squad has been largely focused on 2026 and beyond, its 2025 campaign is the result of a rapid transformation of the team behind the scenes, led by team boss James Vowles and sanctioned by owner Dorilton Capital.\n\nFollowing a troubled 2024 campaign that was marked by costly crashes, a late and overweight launch car and various operational errors, 2025 has given Albon confidence that Williams is now in a much better place to set its sights on the front four teams, rather than look over its shoulder.\n\n\"We've had a few years where we took a step back. I think 2024 stands out to me as a year of setbacks,\" Albon said. \"But the foundations of the team became a lot healthier, and you saw a big jump from 2024 to 2025. There's a great positivity, great culture within the team, great optimism as well. There's confidence in the team as well.\n\n\"I feel like we're a team that can do great things. Even if we were to start slow [in 2026], I think we've got a great team behind us who can find solutions and adapt quickly.\n\n\"I've been in this team when we did our first regulation change in 2022, and it was a tough year. I look at our team now and see how much healthier we are.

    "description": "Part one of a look at players who have worn the number 18 for the Phillies",
    "fullText": "Two years ago, as part of my celebration of Chanukah, I examined some of the players who have worn the number eight for the Phillies. For this year’s celebration, I decided to add ten to the number and look at some of the more notable players who have donned 18.\n\nOne curious thing I discovered: The Phillies have never had a player with a number in the 80s. Seven of the ten 70’s numbers have been used, as have four in the nineties. But in all these years, not once has a player chosen to wear a two-digit number starting with eight.\n\nI also learned that unlike eight, eighteen has not been a successful number for the Phillies. Only one player has kept it for more than three seasons, and most of the prominent players who have worn it went on to switch to other numbers as their careers advanced.\n\nThe first Phillies to wear the 18 was righthanded pitcher Chet Nichols who donned it for eleven games in 1932. Nichols set a bad precedent for the number by putting up a 6.98 ERA. He was out of the league the following year.\n\nBefore starting Genesis, Phil Collins spent seven years as a pitcher with the Phillies. (It’s possible that they are actually two different people.) Collins wore four different numbers in his career, and as it turns out, the season he wore 18 was one of his worst.\n\n#OTD 1935 – The Cardinals purchased Phil Collins from the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nCollins would go on to become the drummer/singer of the rock band Genesis and then launch a successful solo career. 🤣#STLCards #ForTheLou pic.twitter.com/mzR6yRMfrm\n\n— Augie Nash (@AugieNash) May 7, 2025\n\nThree different players wore 18 in 1933, and none distinguished themselves. The number then went unused until 1938 when lefty Al Smith took it on. Smith would have some solid seasons in the majors, but none of them came with the Phillies.\n\nThe number 18 was passed around to a bunch of players in the next few years. None of these players were especially noteworthy, and most quickly left town shortly after arriving. Sam Nahem even wore it twice, bookending military service with two unimpressive stints with the team.\n\nMilo Candini wasn’t the best player to wear the 18, but he put up a decent season for the Whiz Kids in 1950. The righthanded reliever put up a 2.70 ERA in 18(!) games for the pennant winners.\n\nToday in Relief Room history 1949 the #Phillies select Milo Candini from OAK of the PCL in the Rule 5 draft. He was average in his 33G here but he's in the Manteca HOF & has a street named for him in his home town of Manteca CA. Plus what a handsome devil. pic.twitter.com/Sxw6T4q2Tg\n\n— TheReliefRoom (@TheReliefRoom) November 17, 2025\n\nChris Short had a long successful career with the Phillies…but most of that success came wearing number 41. He switched out of the 18 after a three-game cameo in his first year in the majors.\n\nRyne Duren was a three-time All-Star with the Yankees early in his career. Those days were past him when he joined the Phillies in 1963, but he still pitched effectively that season. (3.30 ERA) The Phillies couldn’t have been that impressed, because they sold him to the Reds early in 1964. That may have worked out in Duren’s favor as he got to avoid the team’s September collapse.\n\nSimilar to Chris Short, Rick Wise had a successful career that started out with an unsuccessful season wearing the number 18. He pitched in six September games for the 1964 Phillies, and understandably wanted to change things up when he returned to the majors two years later.\n\nHebner was a mainstay for the Pirates before signing with the Phillies as a free agent before the 1977 season. The first baseman turned in two solid offensive seasons for the National League East champs.\n\nOTD in 1976, free agent Richie Hebner signed with @Phillies Phillies. \n\nComing off 2 subpar years, Hebner, who had topped .290 in four separate seasons w @Pittsburgh, rebounded nicely in 1977, batting .285 with 18 home runs to help lead Philadelphia to a NL East division title. pic.twitter.com/TCp8xdSAha\n\n— 1970s Baseball (@70sBaseball) December 15, 2019\n\n“Vuk” didn’t have the most prolific playing career, but the infielder wore 18 while mostly sitting on the bench for the 1980 World Series champions. He was a very popular clubhouse figure and went on to serve as a coach for the team from 1988 to 2004. For his work as a coach, he was elected to the team’s Wall of Fame in 2007.\n\nToday is the 18th, what player did you like that wore that number? Mine was John Vukovich. #Phillies #RingTheBell pic.twitter.com/SmRcgkHoFg\n\n— PhilsRedOctober (@PhilsRedOctober) November 18, 2025\n\nThere aren’t good records on what numbers coaches wore but seeing that the 18 was sparsely used during that time, it stands to reason than Vukovich used it and might have occasionally switched if a player requested it.\n\nAs I warned you, that wasn’t the most prolific list of players in Phillies history. I’ll be back tomorrow with part two, which will consist of more guys you’ve heard of (for better or worse.)",

It is also the second time in as many years that IndyCar will be the only premier motorsports series in North America with all races broadcast on network television.\n\nUnique to this upcoming season is the summer stretch that also features FOX Sports’ coverage of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The opening match on Sunday, June 21, will lead into the IndyCar Series round at Road America set for 2 pm (all times Eastern). That theme continues as one game in the World Cup’s round of 16 follows the 12:30 pm start time for the race at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course on July 5.\n\nThe only broadcast time unconfirmed is the Music City Grand Prix at Nashville Superspeedway on Sunday, July 19, with the 400-mile race immediately following the FIFA World Cup Final. A start time will be confirmed at a later date.\n\nThe 2025 season was the first year of IndyCar’s multi-year partnership with FOX Sports, with viewership increasing 27% from the previous season. It was the “fastest growth curve of any major sport,” according to the press release.\n\n“Once again FOX Sports is providing an unparalleled platform to showcase the most competitive and dynamic racing series on the planet,” Penske Entertainment Corp. president and CEO Mark Miles said. “On the heels of significant milestones and momentum last year, this new season will provide meaningful opportunities to reach new audiences and build upon the best growth trajectory in all of sports.”\n\nOther notables of the broadcast schedule include the second round of the season at Phoenix Raceway, which will be a unique shared weekend with NASCAR. IndyCar’s return to the 1-mile oval for the first time since 2018 will see race coverage for North America’s premier open-wheel championship begin at 3 pm Sunday, March 7.\n\nThe inaugural Grand Prix of Arlington is set for Sunday, March 15, with a 30-minute prerace beginning at 12:30 pm.\n\nCoverage for qualifying for the 110th Running of the Indianapolis 500 begins at 4 pm on Saturday, May 16 and Sunday, May 17.

The new season can’t get here soon enough.\"\n\nCoverage of all IndyCar practice and qualifying sessions will be featured on either FS1 or FS2, FOX One and the FOX Sports app. The coverage schedule for Indy NXT, the development category for IndyCar, will be announced at a later date.\n\n“I’m a big sports fan, so having the 2026 IndyCar schedule share the stage with FOX’s coverage of the World Cup next summer is going to be exciting,\" said Kyle Kirkwood, driver of the No. 27 Andretti Global Honda. \"2025 was a breakout year for me, and it was especially rewarding to see it all play out on FOX in their first IndyCar season.

    "description": "Here's a look at where the Auburn Tigers rank in the KenPom ahead of Saturday's massive game with Purdue.",
    "fullText": "The Auburn Tigers are set to face one last challenge in nonconference action this Saturday when they travel to Indianapolis to face the No. 6 Purdue Boilermakers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.\n\nWith the game being played on a neutral court, it will be a quad-1 opportunity for both teams. The No. 24 Tigers check in at No. 35 in the NET, while Purdue will enter the game ranked No. 9. Purdue is 2-1 in such games with wins over Alabama on the road and Texas Tech on a neutral site in the Bahamas. Auburn is 1-3, with its lone win coming against St. John's in Las Vegas as part of the Players' Era Festival.\n\nAnalytically, the offense will be a key focal point as both teams rank in the top 15 in offensive efficiency according to KenPom, with Purdue holding the edge defensively. Tempo-wise, Purdue has a great chance of controlling the clock as the Boilermakers rank near the bottom nationally in tempo. Mixing in the fact that the game will be played in a Purdue-heavy environment in Indianapolis, Auburn will need to be extra motivated to pull off the upset.\n\nHere is a breakdown of where Auburn ranks in major categories measured by KenPom ahead of Saturday's game against Purdue.\n\nThe Tigers continue to play above preseason expectations by ranking No. 30, one spot ahead of their preseason outlook. Heading into Thursday, Auburn has wins over two teams ranked ahead of them in KenPom... St. John's (No. 18), and NC State (No. 28).\n\nAuburn is playing offense at a high level, according to KenPom's data. The Tigers are the third-most-efficient offense in the SEC with a rating of 122.7. The Tigers average 86.5 points per game, which ranks No. 9 among SEC teams as the nonconference portion of the schedule winds down.\n\nAuburn's defensive struggles are visible through the KenPom. The Tigers rank No. 77 in the latest KenPom update, which is No. 11 among SEC teams and one spot higher than conference rival Texas. The Tigers are No. 14 in the conference in points allowed (76.8), No. 15 in field goal percentage (.438), No. 8 in defensive rebounds (33.1), and No. 6 in blocked shots (51).\n\nAuburn is slightly above the national average in this category with 69.3 possessions per game. They will look to make the most of their possessions on Saturday as Purdue is considered one of the \"slowest\" teams in the country in this regard.\n\nAuburn's combined opponent offensive efficiency rating ranks No. 41 in the nation (111.6), and ranks No. 23 defensively (103.9), which adds up to give Auburn one of the toughest schedules in the country.\n\nHere's how Purdue stacks up with Auburn in the latest KenPom update ahead of Saturday's game.\n\nAdjusted offensive efficiency: No. 1 (127.1)\n\nAdjusted defensive efficiency: No. 24 (97.3)\n\nPrediction: Purdue has a 77% chance of winning on Saturday, with an implied score of 82-74.\n\nContact/Follow us @TheAuburnWire on  X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "Our Raptors vs. Bucks predictions expect Immanuel Quickley to lead Toronto to victory in Milwaukee.",
    "fullText": "The Milwaukee Bucks are a franchise on the precipice. They were struggling to support superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo when he was on the court, and without him, they’ve been downright awful.\n\nTonight, they’ll host a Toronto Raptors team dealing with its own set of injuries, but look much closer to pulling themselves out of their slump than Milwaukee does.\n\nMy Raptors vs. Bucks predictions and NBA picks break down tonight's Eastern Conference matchup.\n\nRaptors vs Bucks best bet: Immanuel Quickley Over 16.5 points (-115)\n\nNo matter what you think of this Milwaukee Bucks situation, Giannis Antetokounmpo won’t be on the court when they host the Toronto Raptors tonight.\n\nThings have been so bad for the Bucks that the Raptors are 5.5-point road favorites in this matchup, and that’s despite Toronto going through its own struggles. The Raptors have been in a slump since RJ Barrett went down with a knee injury.\n\nNow, the Raps are starting to play a little better, coming off a 106-96 win over the Heat, but that's the only time they've covered the spread in their last nine games. Still, what the Raptors have is firepower against a shaky Bucks defense.\n\nThat has me looking at the point total for Raptors guard Immanuel Quickley. IQ got off to a slow start this season, but he’s started to find his rhythm lately. He is averaging 19.1 points per game while shooting 41.2% from 3-point range over his last seven games.\n\nHe'll face a Bucks team that ranks 24th in defensive rating and ranks 21st in opponent 3-point attempts and makes per game. His point total sits at 16.5, a number he's gone Over in four of his last seven games.\n\nThe other thing the Bucks have really struggled with is cleaning the glass. They rank next-to-last in the NBA in rebounding rate, and that’s with one of the NBA’s best rebounders for half of their games.\n\nSo, without Giannis, Scottie Barnes shouldn’t face much resistance on the boards. Barnes averages 7.9 rebounds per game, and his rebounding prop sits at 8.5, a number he’s gone Over in six of his last 10 games.\n\nWhile both of these teams are struggling, the Raptors are in a better position and have more depth at the moment. They’ve had trouble covering spreads, but I think they pull out the win.\n\nImmanuel Quickley Over 16.5 points\n\nScottie Barnes Over 8.5 rebounds\n\nFor our longshot, let's bump the Raptors moneyline to them covering the spread and taking another Raps player in Jamal Shead to go Over their rebounding total.\n\nImmanuel Quickley Over 16.5 points\n\nScottie Barnes Over 8.5 rebounds\n\nMoneyline: Raptors -200 | Bucks +165\n\nOver/Under: Over 219.5 | Under 219.5\n\nThe Bucks have only covered the first-half spread in 22 of their last 60 games for a -20.70 units and a -30% ROI.

    "fullText": "MIAMI (AP) — Jake Paul proudly boasts he has become the face of boxing during the past decade. Now the YouTuber-turned-fighter is ready to embark on his riskiest ring venture yet after 13 professional fights featuring a cross section of opponents that lack the active status and talent of his next rival.\n\nPaul will fight two-time heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua on Friday night at the Kaseya Center, home of the NBA’s Miami Heat. The scheduled eight-round bout will be streamed on Netflix without the pay-per-view designation.\n\nAlthough the 36-year-old Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) has not fought since September 2024, when he was knocked out by Daniel Dubois in five rounds, he is the prohibitive favorite to derail Paul’s ambitious fight plans.\n\n“The odds are stacked against me,” Paul said Wednesday in the fighters’ final media appearance before the bout. “There are no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it’s this big of a difference in terms of skills, experience, resume, height, weight. This is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sport and you guys get to witness it.”\n\nIn their photo standoff that closed Wednesday’s event, the 6-foot-6 Joshua towered over the 6-1 Paul. Joshua also has a six-inch reach advantage, 82-76. In addition, 12 of Paul’s bouts have been at the 200-pound cruiserweight limit.\n\nThe 28-year-old Paul (12-1, 7 KOs) has built his professional record through unconventional methods. He has victories over retired UFC champions Anderson Silva and Nate Díaz and also won a convincing decision against former middleweight titleholder Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.\n\nPaul’s ability to entice 58-year-old Mike Tyson to fight him last year further enhanced the circus-like atmosphere that often define his bouts. Yet, the bout against legendary heavyweight champion, which Paul won by unanimous decision, attracted 72,300 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight also generated a reported 108 million global views.\n\nFor all the followers Paul has won through his social media platforms, he acknowledges there are detractors who view him as an insult to the sport and the fighters who have traveled the arduous trek toward contention and championship opportunities.\n\n“No one has done more for the sport of boxing in the past decade than myself,” said Paul, who also has formed his promotional company that will oversee Friday’s nine-bout card. “I think if people really cared about boxing they’d want me to win.\n\n“I see the angle that they’re coming from – that (Joshua’s) the traditional boxer, that he’s been doing it for his whole life. But I think I’m more important for the sport of boxing. If they actually cared about the sport, they’d want me to win.”\n\nJoshua, who also won an Olympic gold medal representing his native England in the 2012 Summer Games, understands his perceived role as a boxing savior against Paul.\n\n“It just seems I’ve been called in to save the purest of boxing,” Joshua said. “People don’t like the fact that I’m fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question. If we look at the people that don’t want me to be here, they want me to put an end to the Jake Paul show. That’s why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.”\n\nJoshua’s bout against Paul will be his second in the United States. And Joshua wants to leave the ring Friday with a better outcome than in his debut, when Andy Ruiz Jr. knocked him out in seven rounds to end his first heavyweight reign six years ago at Madison Square Garden.\n\n“It was a tragedy. It was a loss,” Joshua said of his first professional defeat. “But if you’re in sports, it may happen. You may take some losses but the goal is to bounce back. Through tragedy there can always be a great story. This is just part of what my life is.”\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/sports",

    "fullText": "A plane registered to former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle crashed at Statesville Regional Airport in Statesville, North Carolina, on Thursday. It is unclear who was on the plane at the time of the crash. Multiple reports indicate there have been multiple fatalities.\n\nThe Cessna Citation was scheduled to fly to Sarasota/Bradenton International Airport from Statesville, about 40 miles north of Charlotte. But, per FlightAware, it traveled just 29 miles before it crashed while attempting to land back at Statesville at 10:15 a.m. ET.\n\nMultiple people have died after a plane crashed in Iredell County on Thursday morning.\n\nDetails: https://t.co/rMUGoKd8sr pic.twitter.com/mtbVbHiGg2\n\n— WBTV News (@WBTV_News) December 18, 2025\n\nThe plane is owned by GB Aviation Leasing LLC. The address listed on the FAA registry for the plane matches an address for Biffle in Mooresville, North Carolina. A brief news conference by Statesville officials early Thursday afternoon did not provide much information other than confirming the crash took place and the airport was closed.\n\nIn 2024, Biffle, a licensed pilot, used his helicopter and pilot skills to help people in remote areas of North Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. The hurricane had flooded out roads and caused significant infrastructure damage to the Appalachians thanks to flooding rains.\n\nBiffle, 55, won 19 Cup Series races over his NASCAR career. His best season came in 2005, when he finished second to Tony Stewart in the points standings. Biffle’s six wins were the most of anyone in the Cup Series that season and his average finish of 11.9 was second only to Stewart.\n\nBiffle finished in the top 10 in the Cup Series points standings in six different seasons. He was third in 2008 and finished fifth in 2012.\n\nThis post will be updated with more information.",

    "fullText": "Thursday delivers a slate built around one game that carries monumental weight in the NFL, as the Seahawks and Rams collide in a pivotal divisional showdown with major playoff implications on the line. While the spotlight shines brightest on the NFC West battle, the night also features a full menu of NHL action where matchups, trends and numbers create value across the board. Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: A pair of 11-3 teams collide on Thursday Night Football as the Los Angeles Rams travel to Seattle to face the Seahawks, with sole possession of first place in the NFC West on the line.\n\nTonight marks uncharted territory for the NFL. For the first time in league history, two teams with 11 or more wins meet on Thursday Night Football, as the Rams and Seahawks square off with the No. 1 seed hanging in the balance. Given the stakes, the matchup has a strong case as the most significant Thursday night game the league has ever seen.\n\nAccording to FTN’s proprietary metric DVOA (defensive-adjusted value over average), these are two of the best teams ever through 14 games. The statistic has been tracked since 1978, with the 2007 Patriots ranking No. 1 all time after finishing the regular season a perfect 16-0.\n\nHistory in the making 👀\n\nWeek 15 DVOA Ratings ➡️ https://t.co/T1Gel5KrfN pic.twitter.com/azJiozirlq\n\n— FTN Fantasy (@FTNFantasy) December 17, 2025\n\nSeattle and Los Angeles have been elite on both sides of the ball, each ranking inside the top five in scoring offense and scoring defense. Much of that success has been driven by two of the NFL’s premier wide receivers. Seattle’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba leads the league with 1,541 receiving yards on 96 catches, while Los Angeles has leaned heavily on third-year wideout Puka Nacua. The Rams will likely be without Davante Adams, however, as the future Hall of Famer is dealing with a hamstring injury suffered in Sunday’s win over Detroit.\n\nWeather could also a noteworthy factor that affects the outcome. Rain is expected throughout the night in Seattle, conditions that often push offenses to lean on the ground game. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum headline the Rams’ backfield, while Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet carry the load for the Seahawks.\n\nWith first place at stake, key skill players potentially sidelined and slick field conditions in play, expect both defenses to prioritize limiting explosive plays and force long, methodical drives. A slower tempo paired with two elite defensive units points toward a tightly contested game that struggles to reach the projected point total.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (14-10-9) wrap up a three-game road trip as they visit the Tampa Bay Lightning (18-12-3) at Benchmark International Arena.\n\nEntering tonight, both teams are looking to get back on track. Tampa Bay arrives after consecutive losses to the New York Islanders and Florida, while Los Angeles has dropped four straight. Defense has been a common strength, with both clubs ranking inside the top five in goals allowed. Tampa Bay sits fifth and Los Angeles second, with each allowing 2.6 goals per game. That combined average of 5.2 goals comes in slightly below tonight’s projected total.\n\nDefense has not been the lone driver of Tampa Bay’s success this season. Through 33 games, the Lightning are averaging 3.2 goals per game, eighth-best in the NHL. Strong play at both ends of the ice has helped Tampa Bay post a plus-19 goal differential, which ranks fourth in the league.\n\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, has leaned heavily on its defensive structure, but its offense has lagged behind. The Kings enter with the NHL’s 30th-ranked scoring offense and will need to find some consistency to keep the losing skid from growing. With two elite defensive units on the ice, expect scoring chances to be limited and the pace to stay controlled in a low-scoring matchup.",

    "fullText": "Opta statistics released by OptaJoe this week reveal that Jurrien Timber has the lowest dribbled-past percentage for full-backs in the Premier League this season, based on a minimum of 30 true tackle attempts.\n\nTimber has made 57 attempted tackles, with only five players getting past him, putting him at a 91% success rate.\n\nThe nearest player is Reinildo Mandava of Sunderland, who has been dribbled past four times from 38 attempts for an 89% success rate, followed by Michael Kayode (six from 46).\n\nRiccardo Calafiori rounds out the top four, with only six of 45 dribble attempts against the Arsenal left-back proving successful.\n\nThe Gunners’ starting full-backs both featuring in the top four in the league is likely a big factor in the club’s impressive defensive record this season.\n\nFew would argue that Timber and Calafiori aren’t some of the best full-backs in the division, and the central defensive combination of Gabriel Magalhaes and William Saliba has been one of the best around for a long time now.\n\nThe concern at the moment is just around how often those four players will actually make it onto the pitch together.\n\nTimber and Calafiori have both had serious injury issues with Arsenal in the past, and both have been dealing with knocks over the last fortnight. To make matters worse, Timber’s backups Ben White and Cristhian Mosquera are both injured, denying him rest opportunities.\n\nThen Saliba has spent some time on the sidelines recently too, and Gabriel remains out of action with an Adductor injury.\n\nIf the quartet can all get fit and stay fit for the second half of the season, Arsenal will have a great chance at winning some trophies.",

Your support helped shape the player and the man I am today, and I’ll always be grateful for the opportunity to wear that uniform,” Garcia wrote.\n\n“The Password” also expressed excitement for the next phase of his career with the Pirates, where he’ll look to establish himself as an everyday player after appearing in just five games for Boston last season.\n\n“Now it’s time for the next chapter,” Garcia continued. “I’m excited to join the Pittsburgh Pirates and get to work. New city, new colors, new goals — and yes, a new password. I’m all in on helping bring a World Series back to Pittsburgh. Let’s get to work.”\n\nWhile the Red Sox will miss Garcia, they are hoping Johan Oviedo and the two prospects they acquired in the deal can help them achieve their goals in 2026 and beyond.\n\nJeff Passan Explains Why Red Sox Missed Out On Pete Alonso, Kyle Schwarber",

    "description": "“Chris Paul has always been one of my favorite players,” Rockets guard Reed Sheppard says. “Just the way he can control the game with his pace.”",
    "fullText": "As a relatively undersized guard, Reed Sheppard is enjoying a second-year breakthrough with the 2025-26 Houston Rockets.\n\nSo, it might not come as a surprise to learn who the 21-year-old Kentucky product looked up to, as he developed some of those crafty on-court traits.\n\nSpeaking on a newly released podcast episode of The Young Man and The Three, Sheppard was asked about his childhood and whether closely watched or modeled his game around any NBA players.\n\nChris Paul has always been one of my favorite players. Just the way he can control the game with his pace.\n\nI like watching the way he moves, and the reads he makes. I’ve always been a fan.\n\nDespite standing at just 6-foot-0, Paul used a unique and blend of court vision, shooting, and savvy to become a 12-time NBA All-Star and a future Hall of Famer. One of his best years was with the 2017-18 Houston Rockets, who finished with the best regular-season record (65-17) in franchise history.\n\nSheppard knows he has a long way to go, as a player, to come anywhere close to that resume. But as a developing prospect, it’s certainly not a bad archetype to try and take pointers from.\n\nThis season, Sheppard enters Thursday averaging 12.9 points, 3.1 assists, 3.1 rebounds, and 1.6 steals in 25.2 minutes per game while shooting 43.7% on 3-pointers.\n\nHe’s posting those numbers while playing a key rotation role for the Rockets (16-7), who view themselves among the top tier of Western Conference contenders.\n\nAs for Paul, now 40 years old, he’s currently searching for his next (and final) NBA home. It appears unlikely for that to be Houston, since the Rockets already have at least two accomplished backups at point guard — Sheppard and Aaron Holiday — on their 2025-26 roster.\n\nYet, Paul’s influence is likely to be felt around the Rockets, no matter what.\n\nMore: ‘Can flip a game’: Nuggets marvel at young Rockets guard Reed Sheppard\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: In developmental years, Rockets guard Reed Sheppard studied Chris Paul",

    "description": "The two-time unified heavyweight world champion will be significantly heavier than Jake Paul when the pair collide Friday on Netflix.",
    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua will outweigh Jake Paul by at least 27 pounds Friday in their controversial Netflix boxing match. The two fighters tipped the scales Thursday at the event’s official weigh-ins in Miami.\n\nJoshua, an Olympic super heavyweight champion and two-time unified heavyweight world champion, weighed in at 243.4 pounds for Friday’s heavyweight collision.\n\nPaul, who was previously preparing for a fight against 135-pound boxing world champion Gervonta Davis before Joshua stepped in on short notice, weighed in at a much lighter 216.4 pounds.\n\nThe vast size difference between the two fighters has been one of many divisive points ahead of this weekend’s matchup. Joshua is one of the most accomplished heavyweights of this era. Standing 6-foot-6 with a gargantuan 82-inch reach, he remains one of the top-ranked boxers in the world. He challenged for the IBF world title in his last fight — a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois at London's Wembley Stadium.\n\nBecause of the immense size and skill gap between the two fighters, Joshua was contractually not permitted to weigh-in heavier than 245 pounds.\n\nPaul vs. Joshua will be contested with 10-ounce gloves across eight three-minute rounds at Miami's Kaseya Center. Prelims begin at 4:45 p.m. ET and stream on Netflix's Tudum platform, while the main card begins at 8 p.m. ET and airs live on Netflix, free for all subscribers. Main event rings walks are expected around 10:30 p.m. ET.\n\nUncrowned will have full live coverage and round-by-round results of the action.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have used the loan system once again this season in the case of several young and fringe players.\n\nAdmittedly it’s a mixed bag - with the likes of Harvey Elliott, James McConnell and Lewis Koumas enduring tough spells with their respective loan clubs.\n\nAll three could return to their parent club in January - with McConnell and Koumas tipped to pick up loan deals elsewhere for the second half of the campaign.\n\nIn the case of Elliott meanwhile he could make a breakthrough for Arne Slot’s first team in the latter stages of the season - given he is ineligible to represent a third club of the season following appearances for both Liverpool and Aston Villa.\n\nThe club may also be tempted to seek deals for player who haven’t succeeded in making major impacts for the seniors this term - including Stefan Bajcetic and Rio Ngumoha.\n\nBut it appears that a loan spell can now be ruled out for their 21-year-old left-back Luke Chambers. A highly-regarded academy prospect, the defender has already appeared FOUR times in the first team - although not since the 2023/24 season.\n\nIn truth the England under-20 international has been struggling with injuries - being sent back from his previous loan spell at Wigan last season in order to nurse an injury.\n\nChambers was back on the field for the recent Liverpool under-21 friendly defeat to OGC Nice at the AXA Training Centre.\n\n“Chambers came off the bench for the final half-hour to mark his first appearance since suffering a recurrence of a serious back injury in March,” a report from This Is Anfield reads.\n\nHowever it is not likely that Chambers will be getting first-team football elsewhere in the second half of the season according to the same report.\n\n“The left-back, 21, was on loan at Wigan when he sustained the injury and has since focused on his recovery back at the AXA,” the report continues.\n\n“While his quality and experience would no doubt interest a host of clubs in the January transfer window, the likelihood is that he will stay with the U21s for the remainder of the season to focus on his fitness.”\n\nChambers was in very good form for Wigan last season before suffering his injury. Liverpool will be hoping he can regain some of his form during the latter half of the campaign even if a first-team breakthrough still looks out of reach.",

    "fullText": "The NFL has held at least one match on Christmas Day every year since 2020, with three 25 December fixtures scheduled in 2025.\n\nIt has previously held matches on the holiday, but between 1989 and 2019 would only occasionally schedule regular-season games on that date. This only tended to take place in years when Christmas Day would fall on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday.\n\nEarlier this season, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that from this year onwards there would be three games held every year on 25 December.\n\nSince 2021, two or three games have taken place on Christmas Day each year, with this year being a three-game day, much like in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAll three Christmas Day matches are between teams that have strong rivalries.\n\nThe Washington Commanders will host the Dallas Cowboys in the first game of the day, with the Minnesota Vikings playing at home against the Detroit Lions in the second.\n\nIn the third and final game of the day the Kansas City Chiefs face the Denver Broncos.\n\nWhile all three games kick off on Christmas Day in America, because of time zone differences the Chiefs-Broncos game will actually start in the early hours of 26 December at 01:15 GMT.\n\nStreaming site Netflix will show the first two games, as it did in 2024. The third match will be shown on Prime Video.\n\nIn 1971, the NFL held its first two Christmas Day matches following the merger between the American Football League and National Football League in the previous year.\n\nThose two matches were play-off games and the unpopularity of the decision to host the Christmas Day double-header led to an 18-year gap before matches were played again on 25 December.\n\nThursday, 25 December 18:00: Dallas Cowboys @ Washington Commanders\n\nThursday, 25 December 21:30: Detroit Lions @ Minnesota Vikings\n\nFriday, 26 December 01:15: Denver Broncos @ Kansas City Chiefs\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhy are there NFL matches on Thanksgiving?\n\nWhy do some NFL rookies struggle in their second year?\n\nWhat are the differences between NFL wide receivers and tight ends?\n\nHow does studying game film work in American football?",

Joshua is a two-time heavyweight champion, while Paul has never fought at heavier than 227 pounds.\n\nOriginally, it was Paul who was supposed to be the bigger man when he was scheduled to fight WBA lightweight champion Gervonta “Tank” Davis on Nov. 14; however, following Davis being named in a civil lawsuit in which a former girlfriend accused him of battery and kidnapping among other charges, Davis was pulled from the fight and replaced by Joshua and the new bout was scheduled for Dec. 19.\n\nWatch highlights of the main event weigh-ins below.\n\nJake Paul SCREAMS a promo after weighing in ahead of his boxing match against Anthony Joshua:\n\n\"When the ring bells, I am coming in there and I am coming on his ass!

After eight rounds of forgettable action, Paul won a unanimous decision over Tyson.\n\nJoshua (28-4) is coming off of a disappointing loss to Daniel Dubois. The former champion had won four straight fights—including a powerful knockout of UFC and PFL star Francis Ngannou—to earn his shot at Dubois’ IBF belt, but was finished in the fifth round.\n\nAlso of note on the main card, the legendary Anderson Silva takes on fellow former UFC champion Tyron Woodley in a 195-pound catchweight bout. Silva and Woodley, two of the most decorated MMA fighters of their respective eras, have both previously fought Paul, with Silva losing a decision, and Woodley going 0-2 against Paul including a loss via a devastating knockout.\n\nFor the co-main event, super featherweight champion Alycia Baumgardner weighed in at 129.2 pounds for her title defense against Canada’s Leila Beaudoin, who came in at the championship limit of 130 pounds.\n\nCheck out official Jake vs. Joshua main card weigh-in results below.\n\nJake Paul (216.4) vs. Anthony Joshua (234.4)\n\nAlycia Baumgardner (129.2) vs. Leila Beaudoin (130)\n\nAnderson Silva (191.4) vs. Tyron Woodley (194)",

    "description": "Mocks aren't the enemy; bad tests are. We scale Go testing using \"Tactical Pairs\": Contract Tests for truth, Scenario Mocks for logic.",
    "fullText": "Browsing the /r/golang subreddit, you might get the impression that \"mock\" is a dirty word.\n\nI was recently reading a thread on testing strategies and was surprised by the intensity of the anti-mock sentiment. The arguments were visceral:\n\nMocks are like payday loans. Convenient. You say “expect this method to be called with args X and Y, return Z”. Seems cheap. But the loan shark quickly starts charging interest.\n\nAt FunnelStory, we see it differently. We’ve learned to love mocks—not as a shortcut, but as the only way to meaningfully build and maintain a complex application as a small team (with no dedicated QA).\n\nWe manage a complex distributed system that orchestrates LLMs, syncs CRM data, and handles long-running workflows. In this environment, relying solely on \"real\" integration tests left us with blind spots.\n\nWe couldn't reliably test what happens when an API sends a 429 Rate Limit, or when a workflow needs to pause for exactly 24 hours. More importantly, we realized that the majority of our edge cases depend on specific combinations of integrations that exist in a customer's workspace—states that are impossible to reproduce or recreate in our own environments.\n\nThis reality drove us to define a new goal: 100% meaningful coverage.\n\nWe don't just want green checkmarks for the \"happy paths\" that run when the database is online. We want to cover the \"chaos paths\" that cause production outages. While we are still refactoring our legacy code to fully meet this standard, this disciplined style of mocking has become indispensable to our scale.\n\nHere is the \"Tactical Pair\" strategy we adopted to make mocks safe, reliable, and effective.\n\nWhen testing systems, you face two opposing risks:\n\nMock Drift: Mocks are static, but reality evolves. If your database schema changes but your mock doesn't, your test suite stays green while production breaks. The mock becomes a lie.\n\nThe Integration Trap: Testing logic that depends on external volatility (like API rate limits or long-running workflows) against real dependencies is slow, flaky, and non-deterministic.\n\nThe solution isn't to pick a side; it's to sequence them. You should never mock a dependency until you have verified its behavior with a real, isolated Contract Test.\n\nA Contract Test verifies the Data Layer against real infrastructure. It does not test business logic; it tests the Round Trip.\n\nFor external APIs, we can't always hit the real endpoint (due to rate limits or auth). Instead, we verify our client can parse Real JSON Responses. We use httpmock with a fixture captured from a real Salesforce call.\n\nOnce these tests pass, we trust that GetIdentity speaks SQL and FindAccountByDomain speaks Salesforce JSON. We can now mock these contracts in higher-level tests without fear of drift.\n\nIt is important to note that Contract Tests are not a replacement for End-to-End (E2E) tests.\n\nA Contract Test proves that \"If the API returns X, my code does Y.\" It does not prove that the API still returns X. If Salesforce changes their API schema tomorrow (which they ideally shouldn't, without a version change), our Contract Test will pass (because it uses a cached fixture), but production will fail.\n\nWe still rely on a lightweight layer of true E2E smoke tests (running on a schedule, not on every PR) to verify that our fixtures are still valid and that authentication flows haven't changed.\n\nOnce these Contract tests pass, however, we trust the boundary. We can now mock these interfaces in our complex logic tests without fear of drift.\n\nYou cannot simply add mocks to coupled code. The application must define dependencies via interfaces rather than concrete structs.\n\nConsider a worker that fetches a calendar event, checks a CRM, and sends a Slack notification.\n\nWith trusted contracts in place, we can use mocks to test \"Impossible\" scenarios—edge cases that are difficult or destructive to reproduce in a real environment.\n\nTesting that nothing happens is notoriously flaky in integration tests. Mocks make this deterministic.\n\nWe can simulate specific downstream failures, such as a Rate Limit error, to ensure the worker re-queues the job correctly.\n\nTo make this practical, we rely on a few battle-tested Go packages:\n\nThis approach uses Contract Tests to prove the code interacts with the database and external APIs correctly, and Scenario Tests to prove the code handles business logic and errors correctly. This separation allows for high confidence in the system's behavior without the overhead of maintaining a full end-to-end test suite for every edge case.",

Surely in today’s high-tech, hyper-surveilled and bureaucratic world, such a scenario is impossible. Apparently not.\n\nThe case of the misplaced plane is just the latest revelation to hit Air India, the beleaguered South Asian carrier that has already been in the headlines following a tragic crash earlier this year.\n\nNow comes the news that this longstanding airline somehow managed to leave one of its old Boeing passenger jets, a 737-200 registered as VT-EHH, gathering dust in Kolkata Airport for 13 years, having completely forgotten it owned it in the first place.\n\nIn fact, when Air India was first contacted about the parking fees for the plane, it denied ownership. But now the airline has finally admitted that it had indeed managed to lose track of the offending plane, and is thus responsible for paying the 10 million rupees (around £85,000) parking bill that it has accrued over the past decade.\n\nTo state the obvious, this isn’t the sort of thing that usually happens to airlines – for equally obvious reasons. The economics of a modern airline mean that planes generally spend as much time in the air as possible, and are only really grounded when they absolutely need to be. If you’re going to spend more than £100 million on a passenger jet, you don’t want to leave it stationary where it might develop problems (planes are, after all, designed to be in the air).\n\nPlanes don’t tend to get retired all that often. Most jetliners will usually spend at least ten years in service with their original airline, after which they may even be sold on to smaller airlines in developing countries (though that happens less regularly these days). Alternatively, older jets can be repurposed into cargo planes, where they can sometimes fly for another 20 years.\n\nAs a last resort, old planes can be sold on to companies who specialise in breaking them down and selling the individual parts. Hence those slightly haunting images of plane “graveyards” in places like Arizona, where they are eventually stripped down into their individual components.\n\nEven leaving aside the numerous business reasons for not letting a plane rust away in an airport parking lot, there are also practical reasons why such a situation is unlikely. As you might expect, airlines have plenty of paperwork when it comes to their hardware, much of which has to be refiled on an annual basis to ensure that planes remain fit to fly.\n\n“Given the regulatory oversight, it’s hard to comprehend that an airline could ever ‘lose’ an aircraft,” says aviation industry expert John Strickland, founder of JLS Consulting. “Things like maintenance and individual component serial numbers would need to be clearly documented.”\n\nThough of course that would require Air India to have had the particular plane on their inventory in the first place.\n\nSome analysts have pointed out that the plane’s orphan status could have resulted from its slightly confusing history. For a start, the plane had originally been registered as belonging to Indian Airlines, another state-owned airline that was eventually merged with Air India back in 2007. Following the merger, the plane was leased out to the Indian postal service to work as a cargo plane. Maybe the paperwork got lost somewhere during the changeover?\n\nNew Zealand-born Campbell Wilson, Air India’s chief executive, claimed the plane had been missed off the ledger when Air India was privatised back in 2022. If the plane wasn’t included on the records at the time, the new company wouldn’t have known it had even acquired it – and would thus have ignored any letters from the Kolkata Airport revenue department.\n\nCould the plane have been put to better use? Almost certainly.\n\nThe fact that the jet had already been fitted out for cargo flights would suggest it could have been used for that purpose. Failing that, it could have been sold for parts. That said, the sale would have been unlikely to make much difference to Air India’s bottom line.\n\n“The aircraft itself is an old one with negligible value,” says John Strickland. “It might have been useful for salvage of materials, but little or nothing more.” Though presumably that is still better than having to settle a 13-year storage bill.\n\nAre there any lessons for other airlines around the world? On the one hand, the “lost” passenger jet does appear to be a one-off – with no other recorded incidents of airlines losing planes in this way. On the other hand, Kolkata Airport has reportedly claimed to have found other “abandoned” planes over the past decade – so this may not be the last time we hear about the strange story of a forgotten plane.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“Our car industry … went to Europe, they went to Mexico, Japan — they went all over. They went to South Korea,” Trump said. “And now it’s just the opposite. They’re all coming back. We have an age that’s coming up, the likes of which this country has never seen.”\n\nTrump pointed to Toyota, which recently announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years (2). According to Trump, companies are increasingly choosing to build in the U.S. to avoid tariffs.\n\n“So they’re coming from Germany, they’re coming from Japan, they’re coming from Canada. Many factories are coming in because they don’t want to pay tariffs — very simple. They’re coming in and they’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said.\n\nThe result, Trump says, could be a historic economic upswing.\n\n“We have a country that potentially is geared to have the most incredible golden years ever,” he said, adding that when factories open up “by the thousands,” it would mark “the golden age of America.”\n\nTo be sure, that manufacturing boom has yet to materialize. According to the Institute for Supply Management, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the ninth consecutive month in November (3).\n\nStill, Trump insists the turnaround is coming soon.\n\n“You’re going to see results in six months to a year. I think you’ll see results — we’ve never had anything like it,” he said.\n\nWhile Trump’s tariff policies have drawn criticism, major companies continue to view the U.S. as one of the most dependable places to build and grow. That confidence is showing up in the scale of capital they’re committing — across multiple industries.\n\nFor instance, Apple has announced a sweeping $600 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and workforce training (4). Johnson & Johnson plans to put $55 billion into U.S. manufacturing, research and development and new technologies (5). Hyundai, meanwhile, is investing $26 billion in the U.S. to boost automotive production capacity, localize key components and accelerate work on future industries (6).",

    "fullText": "Former model Stacey Williams said Donald Trump groped her at Trump Tower in 1993 while her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein watched on in what she described as “some sort of twisted game.”\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the Friday deadline to release the remaining Epstein files, the 57-year-old former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model opened up to The Daily Beast Podcast about her brief relationship with the late sex offender when she was in her twenties and he was in his forties.\n\nWilliams told host Joanna Coles that she met Epstein at a dinner party with other models, “and that’s how I started dating him, which led to, obviously, months later, him walking me into Trump Tower to be groped, assaulted by Donald Trump while the two men stood there and walked and talked as it was happening.”\n\nEpstein and Trump were close friends for many years until a bitter falling-out, supposedly over Epstein poaching Trump’s staff.\n\nIn retrospect, Williams said, it made sense why Epstein kept directing her toward Trump Tower while they were out on a walk and convinced her to “just drop by and see him.”\n\n“I do remember little snippets of Trump saying, ‘Oh yeah, her career is on fire.’ You know, that thing that he does: ‘Everything’s the best,’” she said. “And Jeffrey just kept—he didn’t intervene. He watched it, and then he raged at me in the elevator and on the way down that I allowed it to happen. You know, either it was some sort of twisted game, and he didn’t get the result he wanted. Maybe it was a bet. I don’t know, but I’m confident that that is what occurred.”\n\nShe ended her romance with Epstein soon after.\n\n“I just said, ‘Jeffrey, you are extremely mentally ill and you need to get help. There’s something deeply wrong with you. And stop calling me. I don’t want anything to do with you.’ And he, oddly enough—this is hard for people to understand—but he got weepy. He was very sad.”\n\nThe model previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that Trump “came out of his office right outside of, in sort of the waiting area, and started groping me while the two of them continued having a casual conversation… He’s just moving his hands sort of up and down my body and, like, smiling at him. And Jeffrey smiling back.”\n\nWilliams first went public with her allegations against Trump on a “Survivors for Kamala” Zoom call last year. Though she told NBC News at the time that she had no communications with the Kamala Harris campaign team, that didn’t stop the White House from accusing her of having political motivations.\n\n“These accusations were unequivocally false when they were first contrived and nothing has changed. Democrats and the mainstream media are desperately trying to use this hoax as a distraction to talk about anything other than President Trump’s tremendous successes,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the Daily Beast.\n\nLast year, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt similarly said, “These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris Campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false.”\n\nUnder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump’s Department of Justice must release the federal investigation files related to the disgraced financier by Friday.\n\nThe co-author of the law, California Democrat Ro Khanna, warned that Justice Department officials “could be subject to prosecution given the federal law” and “hauled in front of Congress, the Oversight Committee” if they fail to release the files on time.\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.

    "description": "A 24-year-old living in a medium-sized U.S. city thought he was doing pretty well. He covers his bills, saves for emergencies, contributes to a Roth IRA, goes out with friends, and says he feels grateful and content. In his own words, “Life is good!",
    "fullText": "A 24-year-old living in a medium-sized U.S. city thought he was doing pretty well. He covers his bills, saves for emergencies, contributes to a Roth IRA, goes out with friends, and says he feels grateful and content. In his own words, “Life is good!”\n\nThat feeling didn't change until he did one simple calculation. When he added up his income over a full year, he realized he was bringing home about $26,000. Suddenly, strangers online were telling him that the number meant poverty. The reaction caught him off guard. He said he had felt “comfortable” and “content” until that moment, and only started questioning himself after reading the comments.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThe post, shared on Reddit's r/MiddleClassFinance community recently, sparked a massive debate about what it really means to be poor in America. The man explained that his lifestyle works because his expenses are low and predictable. He rents an apartment with one roommate and pays $705 a month. His car payment is $265, with just seven months left on the loan. Utilities are minimal, groceries run about $250 a month, and he still manages to save roughly $360 every month.\n\nHe openly acknowledged that he has help. His parents paid for his schooling, which cost about $7,000 total. They also cover his phone bill and health insurance until he turns 26. When he first moved out, they helped with furniture and household basics. He said those things made a huge difference and admitted that having that support made his life easier.\n\nStill, the disconnect bothered him. After sharing his income in another post, he said people immediately told him he needed to “figure out how to make more money ASAP.” That response hit harder than he expected. “I honestly feel rich and so so lucky,” he wrote, adding that seeing the $26,000 number made him rethink everything.\n\nTrending: Have $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nMany commenters pointed out that the number itself was misleading. The $26,000 figure is his take-home pay, not his gross salary. Several people noted that when Americans talk about needing $50,000 to be comfortable, they usually mean before taxes. One commenter explained that his income might actually be closer to $35,000 to $40,000 before deductions, which narrows the gap significantly.\n\nOthers focused on how age and life stage shape financial reality. Plenty of people shared stories about living on similar incomes in their early 20s, often with roommates, cheap rent, and few responsibilities. One person said they lived on about $20,000 as a graduate student and felt fine at the time. Another wrote, “If you're happy, you're winning. No need to keep up with the Joneses.”\n\nSee Also: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nAt the same time, there was no shortage of caution. Some warned that his comfort depends on things that can change quickly. Rent could rise. Health insurance will soon be his responsibility. A major car repair could wipe out months of savings. As one commenter put it, being comfortable today is great, until it isn't.\n\nThe original poster didn't push back on those points. He agreed that earning more money will matter in the future and shared that he works as a massage therapist. His employer recently announced plans to offer a 401(k) and is exploring health insurance options. He said he's considering going full-time for the first time in his career and sees a path toward higher income.\n\nRead Next: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "fullText": "T-Mobile, one of the top mobile providers in the U.S., has quietly brought back a generous promo to keep its loyal customers from jumping to another phone carrier.\n\nRecently, T-Mobile has been facing tougher competition from phone carriers such as Verizon and AT&T, which have both been launching free perks and phone deals to attract customers. Cable giants such as Spectrum and Xfinity have also been offering phone plan discounts when bundled with TV and internet services.\n\nAs the wireless market becomes increasingly competitive, more consumers are exploring various options for more affordable phone plans outside their current provider, especially as they notice their monthly bills becoming more expensive.\n\nThe average cost of a single-line phone plan is $76 per month.\n\nApproximately 42% of Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T customers have seen their phone bills rise in the past year, which is 7% higher than average.\n\nAlso, 58% of Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T customers are considering switching to a different phone carrier as their monthly bills become less affordable.\n\nT-Mobile risks losing 75.9 million customers due to high mobile plan pricing.\n\nAmid this nationwide consumer trend, T-Mobile saw its postpaid phone churn (the number of customers who cut their phone service) reach 0.89% during the third quarter of this year, which is 3 basis points higher than what it was during the same quarter last year, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nTo help retain loyal customers, T-Mobile is quietly offering free lines to select customers, a promotion that began on Dec. 11, according to a recent report from The Mobile Report. The last time T-Mobile launched a free line offer was in September.\n\nThe new “Line On Us” promotion offers customers who have had a wireless plan with the company for at least three years an additional line to their existing account for free, with no purchases required. To qualify, customers must also have two paid lines on their account.\n\nIt is also important to note that customers will encounter a one-time activation fee of $10. For customers on a phone plan that doesn’t include taxes and fees, such as the Experience plans, they will have to pay taxes on that free line each month.\n\nAlso, the promo is “bring your own device,” meaning customers can’t finance a phone through that free line.\n\nTo claim this offer, which T-Mobile employees can search under the segment name “Loyalty BYOD Dec 2025,” customers must either contact customer service or visit a T-Mobile store. The promotion is unavailable through the T-Life app.",

    "description": "Health officials said the fragments may cause dental damage or other injuries",
    "fullText": "You might want to check your fridge — hundreds of thousands of cases of shredded cheese sold across the country have been recalled due to contamination concerns.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Great Lakes Cheese Co. recalled more than 260,000 cases of shredded cheese because they may contain metal fragments, according to AP News.\n\nThe recall includes various cheese types sold in stores like Target, Aldi, and Walmart.\n\nPer the FDA website, the recall has a Class II classification, which means the product \"may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\"\n\nHealth officials said metal fragments may cause dental damage or other injuries to the mouth or intestines if ingested.\n\nAP News reported that the shredded cheese was sold in 31 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nAccording to Delish, the FDA issued 241 food and beverage recalls in 2024 — an 8% increase from the year before. Additionally, the number of people who fell ill or died from food contamination doubled.\n\nA major concern surrounding food production and packaging is the use of plastic. Per CNN, plastic packaging can shed microplastics and nanoplastics when you unwrap cheese or open the caps on bottles. Microplastics are tiny particles that have a large impact.\n\nAccording to Stanford researchers, about 10 million to 40 million metric tons of microplastics are released into the environment annually. Studies have linked microplastics exposure to cancer, heart attacks, and a variety of other health issues in humans and animals.\n\nResearchers continue to study the damaging impacts of plastic packaging. Moving away from plastic in food production would likely reduce the risk of accidents that lead to food contamination.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile the United Nations failed to solidify a treaty for plastic production and waste in 2025, global leaders in food and packaging later signed the 2030 Plastic Agenda for Business. The companies involved represent 20% of global plastic packaging.\n\nMeanwhile, you can reduce your exposure to plastic in food by making simple changes at home. Consumer Reports recommended that consumers avoid plastic food containers and replace them with more sustainable options, such as glass or silicone.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO - A woman who was made infamous for a now viral video that documents her behavior at a Hayes Valley restaurant over the weekend in San Francisco, was arrested for public intoxication, police say.\n\nPolice told KTVU that at around 9:41 p.m. on Saturday, officers responded to a business located on the 500 block of Hayes Street regarding a person who was \"escorted\" from the business.\n\nPolice said officers arrived and found the female suspect who was removed from the business.\n\n\"Officers developed probable cause to arrest the woman for public intoxication,\" SFPD Officer Robert Rueca said. \"The suspect was transported to County Jail where she was detained for public intoxication.\"\n\nThe video in question was posted by someone who appears to be a central figure in the video – one of the employees at Hazie's – the restaurant police responded to. The text added to TikTok user miss_little_ranter's video says, \"Woman assaults restaurant staff & guest in San Francisco.\"\n\nTheir video is sarcastically captioned, \"Love getting my hair pulled out and assaulted at Hazies. Just another day in hospitality.\" The hashtags, #FYP, #viral, and #drunk are added to the bottom of the caption. The caption makes total sense if you watch the video until the end.\n\nThe video clocks in at over three minutes long. It opens with an unidentified woman hurling profanity at restaurant staff as she simultaneously takes video with her phone. When the tables are turned on her, and she notices she's being filmed, she physically assaults the employee who is filming.\n\nIn another part, she is seen physically assaulting another person before a woman intervenes and takes the suspect down to the floor. Patrons gasp.\n\nThis chaotic ride doesn't end here. The suspect, who is not done, gets back to her feet and continues to assault staff. Both the suspect and a man who is accompanying her are then physically forced out of the restaurant to the cheers of the patrons.\n\nStill, this wild ordeal isn't over.\n\nThe scuffle continues out on the Hayes Street sidewalk. The suspect gets a handful of miss_little_ranter's hair, which is long and worn up.\n\nWhat appears to be an employee in a Santa hat is heard repeating \"let go\" to the suspect who maintained her grip on the locks. The suspect exchanges kicks with the man she has a hold of. Meanwhile, the man the suspect is with is being restrained as the melee unfolds.\n\nIt appears the suspect realizes her phone was grabbed and tossed far away on the sidewalk. She goes running after it, but her victim, seemingly not above some form of retribution, extends his leg out as she's charging for the phone at full speed and trips her. You can hear her literally pound the pavement.\n\nThe video closes with the suspect melting down on the sidewalk and some more shoving of employees by the man she's with.\n\nWe reached out to the restaurant for a statement and will update if we hear back from them. It is also not clear if assault charges were filed against the suspect.",

    "description": "Violating the ban could result in multiple harsh punishments.",
    "fullText": "Bangladesh has taken a big step forward toward preserving and protecting its national fish.\n\nLast month, the South Asian country announced an eight-month nationwide ban on catching juvenile hilsa. As reported by New Age, the ban lasts until the end of June 2026, and officials hope it will help boost the population of this popular fish.\n\nIn October, Bangladesh implemented a three-week ban on fishing for female hilsa, as a way to protect mothers during the animal's breeding season. Now that the eggs laid by those mothers have hatched, officials say this latest ban will allow newly born hilsa to grow safely, which should rapidly increase their population numbers within the country.\n\nThe ban also comes with severe penalties. Anyone convicted of catching, buying, selling, or transporting hilsa smaller than 10 inches could face up to two years in prison, a fine of up to $4,000, or both.\n\nAlso known as ilish and jatka, hilsa are a vitally important fish in Bangladesh and are a staple in Bangladeshi cuisine. But that also makes them prone to overfishing.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature lists hilsa in its least concern category globally, but notes that its population is decreasing. And in the Persian Gulf, it has been reclassified as near threatened.\n\nFishing bans are an effective way to ensure species' populations don't become dangerously low, and to protect an area's biodiversity.\n\nEarlier this year, eastern Indian officials introduced a ban on all fishing along a 12-mile stretch of three rivers that empty into the Bay of Bengal, as a way of protecting the olive ridley turtle's natural habitat. The U.S. Virgin Islands have enacted an annual fishing ban from October through December to protect several important snapper species.\n\nOverfishing isn't the only threat facing hilsa. The fish have been found to contain microplastics — tiny plastic fragments of less than five millimeters — and metals such as lead and mercury, posing health risks not just to the fish, but also to the people who consume them.\n\nDo you think the government should ban gas-powered lawn tools?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Trump was applauded by MAGA allies for his economic-focused primetime address, despite polls showing that most voters are feeling the opposite.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump was showered with praise by GOP lawmakers and MAGA allies as he insisted that the economy is stronger than how most Americans feel in a primetime speech from the White House.\n\nDuring an 18-minute address, Trump attacked his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and touted his record on immigration, tariffs and culture issues, arguing that the “Golden Age” he proposed on the campaign trail is building momentum. He also announced his administration will be sending $1,776 bonuses, which he called “warrior dividends,” to nearly 1.5 million U.S. service members before Christmas.\n\n“I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it,” Trump said Wednesday night.\n\nThe speech came as Trump has oscillated on his messaging on the economy, boasting it as the “best” to repeatedly labeling affordability as a “hoax” — all while polls show that voters need convincing.\n\nAn NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released hours before he spoke found that the president’s economic approval hit a new low at 36%. A new Fox News poll revealed similar, with most voters believing the economy is in bad shape.\n\nBut while his address was ruthlessly ripped by Democrats, his supporters were singing an entirely different tune.\n\n“He very clearly said to the American people, ‘I see you,’ and look at the things we’ve done,” Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) said on Fox News. “What he has accomplished in just these first 10, 11 months is remarkable, but I think more is yet to come.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich dubbed Trump’s address as “worthy of Ronald Reagan.”\n\n“That was a good speech. It was an important speech,” Gingrich said on Fox News. “Someday, people will say it was one of the most important speeches of his career because it set the table for the entire debate over the next year.”\n\nIn a post on X, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) supported the president’s attacks against the Affordable Care Act, as subsidies are set to expire by the end of the month.\n\n“Republicans will fix what Democrats broke!” he wrote.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also weighed in on X: “High energy, great delivery, grand slam, home run on making the case that the best is yet to come.”\n\nA popular MAGA account posted that Trump “just shows up and performs under pressure.”\n\n“We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetimes,” the user wrote. “I couldn’t feel more secure with him steering the ship.”\n\nIn the background, the economy remains one of the top concerns of voters heading into the 2026 midterm elections, which could be seen as a litmus test for Trump and the GOP as they look to maintain control of the House and Senate.\n\nAfter Democrats scored sweeping victories in November, Trump has since increased his focus on the key issue.\n\n“I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,” Trump said during a campaign-style rally in Pennsylvania last week. “They caused the high prices and we’re bringing them down.”",

The company is a private aircraft provider that also trains pilots for the US military, the UK, and NATO countries.\n\nIn 2019, Isaacman sold the company to Blackstone.\n\nIsaacman hit billionaire status in 2020 after selling Draken International and taking Shift4 public. His net worth is estimated at $1.1 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nIsaacman has been involved in several charitable causes and organizations, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\n\nHis first SpaceX mission raised over $240 million for St. Jude and was named Inspiration4 to inspire support and raise awareness for the research hospital.\n\nIsaacman and his wife have also committed to The Giving Pledge, a charitable campaign founded by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett in 2010.\n\nThe Giving Pledge serves as a commitment from wealthy people to donate the majority of their wealth to philanthropy.\n\nIn 2021, Isaacman funded and led the first civilian mission to space, called Inspiration4. The mission was carried out by SpaceX's Dragon capsule.\n\nIsaacman previously told Business Insider that the prep for the mission was extensive and involved a lot of studying and physical tests.\n\n\"The academics were pretty intense,\" Isaacman said, adding that there were thousands of pages across a hundred manuals to learn about SpaceX's Falcon and Dragon aircraft.\n\nIt also involved crew members learning how to draw blood from each other as well as take skin samples to prepare for increased radiation levels on the trip.\n\nOn September 10, 2024, Isaacman and three other crew members successfully took off on their way into orbit for the first-ever privately funded space walk.\n\nThe space walk featured SpaceX's new EVA suits.\n\nDuring the spacewalk, the Polaris Dawn crew will wear the new SpaceX EVA suits → https://t.co/LRl5pPlAC9 pic.twitter.com/MVHzNwiWZU\n\nPolaris Dawn lifted off from Launch Complex-39A at NASA's KSC, which also saw the launches of other historic missions, such as the Apollo 11 moon landing. Dragon and the Polaris Dawn crew safely arrived back on the coast of Florida on September 15, 2024.\n\nTrump said he was dropping Isaacman's nomination on May 31 in a post on Truth Social, after a \"thorough review of prior associations.\" He also said that he would soon announce a new, \"mission aligned\" nominee.\n\nIsaacman had donated to Democratic candidates throughout his career up until the 2024 election, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nIsaacman responded to the withdrawal on X by saying he was \"incredibly grateful\" to the president, the Senate, and anyone who supported him throughout the nomination.\n\n\"The past six months have been enlightening and, honestly, a bit thrilling. I have gained a much deeper appreciation for the complexities of government and the weight our political leaders carry,\" Isaacman wrote in a post.\n\nIn an episode of the \"All-In Podcast\" released in June, Isaacman said that his Democratic donations were always public and he doesn't think it was the reason his nomination was withdrawn.\n\n\"I don't think that the timing was much of a coincidence that, you know, there was other changes going on the same day,\" Isaacman said, adding that there was \"more than one departure that was covered on that day.\"\n\nIsaacman said that he thinks there were \"axes to grind\" and he was a \"good visible target.\" He said he doesn't \"fault the president at all\" and fully supports him.\n\nMusk had ended his time at the White House leading DOGE just days before the decision to withdraw Isaacman's nomination. Musk swiftly came to Isaacman's defense following the withdrawal and wrote in a post and said on X that it was \"rare to find someone so competent and good-hearted.\"\n\nDays later, Musk ramped up his criticism of Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which escalated into the two exchanging insults on social media. Musk accused the president of being involved in the Epstein files, and Trump threatened to eliminate government contracts with Musk's companies.\n\nWhile the dust appeared to momentarily settle between Musk and Trump after their public dust-up, the feud started back up again when Musk renewed his criticism of Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which was just signed into law in July.\n\nIsaacman was drawn to the forefront as tensions rose between the two.\n\nIn a post about the end of EV mandates in Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" Trump shed some more light on the decision that went into withdrawing Isaacman's nomination.\n\n\"Elon asked that one of his close friends run NASA and, while I thought his friend was very good, I was surprised to learn that he was a blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before,\" Trump said on Truth Social in July.\n\nIsaacman had previously said in the \"All-In Podcast\" in June that he's always been \"somewhat of a moderate\" and leaned right.\n\nTrump added that he thought it was \"inappropriate\" that a close friend of Musk would run NASA when it's such a big part of Musk's corporate life.\n\nOn an episode of the \"Shawn Ryan Show\" in September, Isaacman said he didn't take it seriously when Trump's transition team first approached him about leading NASA.\n\nHe said that in late November 2024, a friend informed him that his name was being circulated for a job in the administration. Then, while running in Central Park, he said he missed a call and had a message from a number he didn't recognize — he said he assumed it was a scam.\n\n\"It was like, 'Would you be interested in serving in DJT's administration?\" Isaacman said on the podcast. \"And I deleted it because I was like, if it was not a scam, it would be just a little bit more legit than this.\"\n\nIsaacman said he realized his mistake when the friend reached out again and said the administration was trying to reach him. He soon got on the phone with Howard Lutnick, who had been running his transition team at the time, about leading NASA, Isaacman said. The next day, he said he met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nHe said Trump shook his hand at the end of the meeting and said \"you got the job.\" Isaacman added that he thought Trump liked him in part because he was a \"political newcomer.\"\n\nMonths after withdrawing his nomination for Isaacman, Trump renominated Isaacman for NASA administrator on Tuesday.\n\n\"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\nFollowing the renomination announcement, Isaacman thanked Trump for the opportunity in a post on X.\n\n\"Godspeed, President Donald J. Trump, and Godspeed NASA, as America leads the greatest adventure in human history,\" Isaacman said in the post.",

    "description": "A doctor said powerlifting helped her boost her mood and energy while building muscle. She said two exercises can save you time in the gym.",
    "fullText": "When Dr. Shernan Holtan started lifting weights in 2013, she was mainly looking for a bit of me-time.\n\nHer career in bone marrow transplants — plus raising two kids — had left her with little room to take care of herself.\n\nAfter hiring a personal trainer, and was shocked at how much her energy and mood improved.\n\n\"All the energy you put in, you get back manyfold more through the metabolic and mental benefits of exercise,\" Holtan told Business Insider.\n\n\"As soon as I really realized what this was doing for me physically and mentally, I wanted to implement this for patients too.\"\n\nHer patients at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York receive stem cell treatments for conditions like leukemia — a grueling procedure that can require months of recovery time in a hospital.\n\nOnce they started following Holtan's personalized exercise plans, they recovered and returned home weeks earlier than expected, according to Roswell Park data.\n\nAs for Holtan, chief of blood and marrow transplant at the center, she is now a record-setting powerlifter, building her way up to an all-time best squat of 308.6 pounds, earning her the top national rank for her age group in 2019.\n\nNow at 49 years old, she can easily squat 225 pounds for reps, deadlift 250, bench 125, and run for miles without getting tired.\n\nShe said her favorite muscle-building exercises pay dividends for long-term health and offer an immediate boost to energy, confidence, and mood.\n\n\"I'm super happy to say at age almost 50, I can do all those things, and that means that I fear very little during any given week,\" she said. \"I know I can tackle these hard things and recover from them. So whatever challenge you have, send it my way.\"\n\nOn a typical day, Holtan hits the gym at about 5:30 a.m. to pump iron before work. Her routine varies, including a mix of strength training, CrossFit, and running for well-balanced fitness.\n\nWhen it comes to muscle and strength gains, \"squats and deadlifts are king,\" Holtan said.\n\nBoth movements are compound exercises, tapping into multiple muscle groups at once, including the core, back, and legs, to secure and stabilize your body and the weight as you move.\n\nTo get the most out of weightlifting and avoid injury, Holtan recommends starting small, with a weight you can handle and a number of reps that doesn't leave you exhausted. Then, build up a little at a time. That can make it easier to stick to a routine, rather than pushing too hard and feeling sore for a week (or more).\n\nFor patients recovering from treatment, Holtan gets them to begin with scaled exercises — doing squats without any added weights, or sitting back into a chair and standing up again until they have strength to do it without supportive equipment.\n\n\"Let's start with where you're at today. That's how you build without hurting yourself,\" she said. \"Major gains can be made over time with consistency.\"\n\nStrength training isn't just about building muscle; it can also help stave off early death, according to a growing body of research.\n\nHowever, it's only part of the equation — exercise that gets your heart pumping is crucial to prevent heart disease and lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, studies show.\n\nThat's why Holtan added running, hiking, and other cardio, like jump roping, to her routine.\n\nAs a result, she's lifting a bit less weight than when she trained for powerlifting alone, but can now easily run for five, six, or even seven miles (a feat she previously thought was unimaginable for her).\n\nChanging it up with new types of training also keeps exercise fun, and boosts her mood and energy, Holtan said, and the better longevity is a bonus.\n\n\"The main motivator, honestly, is I feel better today,\" Holtan said.\"Perhaps my rate of aging is slowing. Perhaps my risk of cancer is decreasing, perhaps my risk of other chronic diseases, including dementia, maybe that's decreasing too, and that's a nice benefit.\"",

    "description": "My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, but I still take solo trips. The time apart is healthy and makes our relationship stronger.",
    "fullText": "When my boyfriend and I first met in Portugal, we were both traveling alone. He had just switched to a remote job so he could explore new places, and I was a year into a 10-country solo trip.\n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship, I knew I didn't want to give up traveling by myself just because I was dating someone. I'd grown up exploring the world, and felt a rush of freedom and independence every time I got on a plane alone.\n\nWe've now been together for three years, and even with all the adventures we've shared together, I still make a point of taking trips on my own — not because my partner lacks the time, money, or desire to come along, but because we've both learned that time apart is healthy for us.\n\nAt first, solo traveling while in a relationship was an adjustment. A few months into being together, I found myself restless and lonely while on a trip to Morocco.\n\nHowever, I realized that traveling solo is like a muscle: If you don't use it, it weakens. To be happy in my relationship, I needed to rebuild that comfort with my own company.\n\nSo, I made sure to keep solo travel as a regular part of my life. These trips are a reset button, and I intentionally try to schedule them in new environments where I can learn more about myself.\n\nIn January, for example, I spent two weeks in Belgium finishing exams for my second master's degree. Having that time alone allowed me to focus, knowing my boyfriend was cheering me on from afar.\n\nThen, I flew to the US to see family, and he joined me later. Being on my own first gave me space to reconnect with friends before sharing that part of my life with him.\n\nStill, not every trip is easy. This spring, I spent two months in China for an internship. Poor internet connection, strict firewalls, and a major time difference made communication tough.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't travel for that long alone again, I learned that I was capable of much more than I thought. I made friends, established a routine, and completed a research project independently. When my partner joined me at the end of my stay, he could see all of my growth.\n\nI love that my trips force me to ask myself how I'd want to spend an entire day if no one else's preferences mattered. They also remind me that I know how to take care of myself, and spark a curiosity about the world that I can bring back to my relationship.\n\nOf course, I still check in with my partner throughout my travels, sending photos, sharing my location for safety, and calling every few days — but the foundation is trust.\n\nHe encourages me to explore the world, and there's never been a hint of jealousy. He's been practicing taking solo trips, too, after I gifted him one to Jeju Island.\n\nTraveling alone not only helps me practice listening to my body and asking for what I need, but it also allows me to explore new foods, routines, and perspectives that I can bring home and share.\n\nThis fall, I visited my 50th country, Georgia. I'll admit, I still feel a little nervous before each trip, but that nervousness always gives way to excitement — the thrill of discovery, and the happiness of sharing stories when I return.\n\nEach journey reminds me why I love traveling alone, but even more, why I always choose to come home.",

    "description": "Kevin Tang, 13, won first place at the 3M Young Scientist Challenge for his project that uses AI to help detect when a person falls in their home.",
    "fullText": "While many teens are using AI to help themselves with homework and socializing, Kevin Tang, 13, is using it to help others.\n\n\"A few years ago, my grandma sadly fell in my kitchen, and nobody noticed immediately,\" Tang told Business Insider. By the time his family found her and called 911, \"it was still too late, since she was left with permanent brain damage.\"\n\nHe later learned that his friend's grandparent had also fallen, and that the family hadn't found out until the following day because they lived in another state.\n\nAfter that, Tang felt compelled to find a way to help not just his family and friends, but the millions of older adults who suffer from falls each year.\n\nHis project, FallGuard, earned him first prize at the 2025 3M Young Scientist Challenge and a cash prize of $25,000, which he said he has already partly reinvested in improving and growing the project.\n\nTang started working on Fallguard in the summer of 2024. Since then, he has built and developed it into a device that uses AI to detect when a person falls in real time and immediately sends an alert to the person's family members' phones via the FallGuard mobile app. It can also detect when a person has been lying down for an extended period.\n\n\"This system does not rely on a cellular carrier and does not generate any messaging fees,\" Tang wrote in a follow-up email. \"A single FallGuard device can be linked to multiple phones so that several caregivers can receive alerts at the same time.\"\n\nUnlike wearable devices that you have to remember to charge and put on, FallGuard works via a camera connected to a computer. \"You can just place [the camera] on the wall, and it works all the time,\" Tang said, later adding that, \"no video is recorded or uploaded, which helps protect privacy.\"\n\nA couple of limitations are that a person must fall within the camera's field of view. Moreover, the camera must be connected to a computer with the FallGuard model, which can only support one camera at a time. Tang said he's working on expanding the system so one device can support multiple cameras that could be placed all around a home. \"So that way you don't have to have multiple computers,\" he said.\n\nTang built FallGuard using MediaPipe, a Google-developed AI library, which can map a person on screen by placing key points on their body. With a two-stage fall detection algorithm that Tang developed, FallGuard analyzes posture and movement over time. It does this via a common tool in computer vision models called bounding boxes that can track how a person's body proportions change from standing to lying down, Tang said.\n\nIf the AI detects a lay-down event, it looks at the previous one second to check if the person's velocity suddenly dropped, helping distinguish a fall from someone lying down intentionally.\n\nThere are still a few kinks Tang is ironing out to improve FallGuard's reliability, he said.\n\nDuring the 3M Young Scientist Challenge, Tang was paired with Mark Gilbertson, a robotics and AI specialist at 3M, who mentored him on the project.\n\nWhile Kevin did all of the programming and designing himself, Gilbertson said he helped with questions like how Tang should mount his device on the wall and what material to use.\n\nFrom the start, Gilbertson said Kevin's personality and project stood out to him. \"I liked that his project had an emotional connection to his life,\" Gilbertson told BI.\n\nWhen Tang won the prize, he was excited that the news would alert more people about FallGuard who could use it, Gilberston said.\n\nIndeed, Tang said he's received interest from about 500 families so far. \"One stood out to me was, this man who was trying really hard to take care of his wife, but he was deaf, so he wouldn't hear his wife fall,\" Gilbertson said, adding that the man noted, \"This invention will just really change our lives and quality of living.\"\n\nOne of the things Tang used the award money for was to purchase a MacBook to code the FallGuard app for computers, so people can convert their own computer into a FallGuard device. It works with most regular computers, he said.\n\nWhen asked what he's most proud of, Tang didn't mention the prize, the title, or the media attention. Instead, he pointed back to the device itself, which hung on the wall behind him.\n\n\"I'm really proud of how much my project evolved from the very start,\" he said. From a tripod and camera, to a mounted device, to an app anyone can download — each model improved on the one before. \"I just kept working until I had a final product.\"",

    "description": "I rode in business class on the Amtrak NextGen Acela train from NYC to Washington, DC, for $180. It was a great experience, but not worth the price.",
    "fullText": "The Amtrak Acela is an express service between Boston and Washington, DC. The train line introduced a new fleet on the route in August 2025, known as NextGen Acela.\n\nIn addition to being the fastest Amtrak train with a top speed of 160 miles per hour, the NextGen Acela has modern interiors and high-tech amenities.\n\nThe Amtrak Acela trains only have two classes — business and first. I booked my business-class ticket for $180.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked at the pricing for coach seating on the regional Amtrak train, which is 30 minutes slower than the Acela. It was $40.\n\nMy train was scheduled to leave at 10 a.m., but there was a 90-minute delay. Since I was stuck at the station for longer than anticipated, I briefly considered going to the Metropolitan Lounge, an elevated space overlooking the train hall with cozy seating and complimentary refreshments.\n\nFirst-class passengers and those traveling in sleeper accommodations can get into the lounge for free, but other Amtrak riders have to pay $50 to access it.\n\nSince I'd already splurged on the business-class ticket, I decided to skip the lounge and head to the standard waiting room instead, but it was full. I finally settled for a seat on the floor against the wall until it was time to board.\n\nWhen I got in line to board, I was reminded that business class is just a standard ticket on the Amtrak Acela. Unlike business-class rides I've taken that also had coach seating, this trip didn't include the perk of priority boarding.\n\nSoft, cushy, spacious, supportive — these are the words that popped into my head when I settled into my business-class seat. A reclining function and footrest made the ride even more comfortable.\n\nPower outlets, USB ports, and a reading light were all conveniently located on the side of the seat. In front of me was a tray table and a fold-out cupholder.\n\nMost Amtrak trains I've been on have had WiFi, but in my experience, the connection has typically been too weak for much more than a Google search.\n\nI was stoked when the NextGen Acela's 5G WiFi was fast enough to stream YouTube videos without any issues. I passed the time by watching live sessions of my favorite bands.\n\nI've learned to set the bar low for train bathrooms. Stocked toilet paper, soap, and paper towels are not a given. Cleanliness and extra space aren't either. In my experience, some business-class bathrooms are no different from those in coach.\n\nSo I was ecstatic when I stepped inside the lavatory on the NextGen Acela. The automatic door opened into a spotless space that felt big enough for two people to do jumping jacks simultaneously.\n\nI found it aesthetically pleasing too, with bold red accents and trendy touches, from the shelf to the mirror.\n\nI also appreciated the touchless water, soap, and dryer functions on the sink.\n\n\"Amtrak travelers always have their preference,\" an Amtrak representative wrote in an email to Business Insider. \"If they want to experience these premium trains with enhanced amenities, they can. Or, if they prefer convenient and affordable downtown-to-downtown service up and down the Northeast Corridor, Northeast Regional trains offer a comfortable and enjoyable way to travel throughout the Northeast Corridor and points beyond.\"\n\nThe next time I take an Amtrak train, I'll miss the cozy seat, elevated bathroom, high-speed WiFi, and shorter travel time. Still, these perks weren't enough for me to consider Acela's business class to be worth more than quadruple the price of a coach ticket.",

    "description": "Humanz, an influencer marketing company, is hyper-focused on M&A. It acquired two startups this year and plans to ink more deals.",
    "fullText": "Advertising giants like Publicis, WPP, and Omnicom aren't the only companies deploying roll-up strategies and shaking up influencer marketing.\n\nHumanz, an Israeli influencer marketing platform that expanded to the US in 2024, is going \"full acquisition mode\" through 2026, CEO Liran Liberman said in an interview.\n\nThe company exclusively told Business Insider that it recently raised $15 million from an undisclosed group of venture capital investors to fuel several M&A deals. In 2025, the company acquired two influencer marketing companies: Bambassadors, a user-generated content marketplace, and Ubiquitous, an influencer marketing agency.\n\nHumanz declined to disclose its own valuation, as well as the financials of its recent acquisitions.\n\nLiberman said that Humanz plans to ink three more deals in the first half of 2026. There are two types of deals the company is eyeing: talent acquisitions (such as targeting another company's network of creators and brands) or tech acquisitions (such as payment solutions).\n\n\"In this space, there are so many niche players,\" Liberman said. \"Imagine a company great in influencer marketing on LinkedIn for B2B, or a tech company only doing creator payments. If I can acquire them … now we can offer more solutions.\"\n\nHumanz's acquisition of Ubiquitous and Bambassadors was a strategic play to expand the company's presence in the US, Liberman said. He said that one reason Humanz sought to acquire Ubiquitous was that it's listed as a top influencer marketing company when prompting ChatGPT.\n\nDiscoverability on AI chat platforms is an increasingly important strategy for brands, leading to a prioritization of generative engine optimization (GEO), a new spin on search engine optimization (SEO).\n\n\"This was kind of our GEO investment,\" Liberman said.\n\nHumanz raised $8 million from debt providers Viola Credit and Mizrahi Bank as part of its $15 million round, which will help finance its acquisitions. The company anticipates revisiting that deal and increasing it to $50 million to support further acquisitions in 2026 and 2027.\n\nHumanz has raised a total of $32 million to date and has about 170 global employees following its recent acquisitions.\n\nLiberman said that Humanz was profitable in 2025. But profitability isn't the company's top priority heading into 2026.\n\n\"We do want to invest a lot in growth,\" he said.\n\nRead the pitch deck Humanz used to raise $15 million for M&A.\n\nNote: Some details and slides, such as financials, have been redacted.\n\nHere are the five challenges it lists:\n\nThe key players, which Humanz says it's \"building trust\" with and connecting, are campaign managers, creators, and talent managers.\n\n\"Our revenue model, consisting of a $1,500 monthly fee and a 20% share of advertiser payments to influencers, ensures a sustainable and scalable business model,\" the slide says.\n\nHere are a few of the clients Humanz lists: Meta, TikTok, Visa, eBay, Google, Unilever, and Adidas.\n\n\"Humanz is executing a bold, strategic plan to secure a dominant position in the $250B creator economy,\" the slide says.\n\nHere's how AI is shaping the creator economy, according to the slide:\n\nRevamped Ecosystem — As content creation becomes easier with AI tools, Humanz is poised to lead the charge by creating better platforms that empower influencers to scale their businesses and drive growth across the industry.\n\nAI Influencers — We are close to the point where it's impossible to distinguish between a human and AI video creation. Humanz is taking proactive steps to ensure that authenticity and transparency remain at the forefront of our platform, empowering both influencers and brands to maintain trust and integrity\n\nIt lists offices in New York, Florida, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Israel (where its HQ is).",

    "fullText": "Peter Schiff warned that Bitcoin is unlikely to find a durable bottom at $50,000.\n\nSchiff argued that Strategy’s valuation is vulnerable to further declines.\n\nMichael Saylor and Strategy have downplayed downside risks and continue to add to their Bitcoin holdings.\n\nBitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Wednesday issued a renewed warning about BTC, arguing that prices will fall well below $50,000 over the long term.\n\nIn the same outburst, Schiff also accused Michael Saylor of disregarding shareholder value as Strategy continues one of the largest corporate Bitcoin accumulation campaigns on record, despite prices falling steeply in recent weeks.\n\nIn a reply on X, Schiff said Bitcoin would not establish a lasting bottom at $50,000, describing that level as merely a short-term reference point.\n\n“No, that’s just a very short-term price target based on MSTR. Long-term Bitcoin will go much lower than $50,000,” Schiff wrote, responding to a user who asked whether prices would rebound after reaching that level.\n\nIn a separate post, Schiff added that Bitcoin would be trading well below $50,000 by the time Strategy’s executive chairman ultimately exits his holdings.\n\n“Bitcoin will be much lower than $50,000 when that happens,” Schiff wrote in response to a user who said they planned to buy once Saylor sells his Bitcoin.\n\nSchiff also targeted Strategy’s stock, arguing that its valuation remains exposed to further downside and is closely linked to Bitcoin’s performance.\n\n“It’s hard to find a chart that looks worse than $MSTR,” Schiff wrote on X. “At a minimum, the stock should drop to about $80, which is half its current price.”\n\nHe added that such a decline in Strategy’s shares would likely coincide with another sharp drop in Bitcoin.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine MSTR dropping that much without a significant decline in Bitcoin as well,” Schiff said. “I’d say a minimum target for BTC is about $50K.”\n\nSchiff has repeatedly argued that Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused strategy prioritizes cryptocurrency exposure over the interests of equity investors.\n\nSaylor and Strategy have consistently minimized perceived risk during periods of Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAfter Bitcoin fell last month, Strategy stated on X that even if BTC declined to its average purchase price of roughly $74,000, the company’s holdings would still cover its outstanding convertible debt multiple times over.\n\nIn November, Strategy CEO Phong Le suggested the company could be forced to sell Bitcoin if its shares traded below the value of its underlying holdings.",

    "description": "This year's defining songs include a pop gem from Taylor Swift's latest album, Olivia Dean's breakout hit, and Kendrick Lamar's best duet with SZA.",
    "fullText": "Reneé Rapp is one of the most technically skilled and expressive vocalists working today. No song from her sophomore album, \"Bite Me,\" exemplifies this better than \"I Think I Like You Better When You're Gone,\" an R&B-inflected anthem for avoidant lovers everywhere.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Mad,\" \"Why Is She Still Here?,\" \"Shy\"\n\n\"Cuntissimo,\" the third single from Marina's sixth album, \"Princess of Power,\" is a welcome return to the pomp of her 2012 cult classic \"Electra Heart,\" which satirized and subverted female archetypes (\"Bubblegum Bitch,\" \"Primadonna,\" \"Homewrecker\") to tell a story of rebellion and independence.\n\nThirteen years later, Marina still prefers to act up rather than settle down, and to counter patriarchy with pleasure.\n\nIn an internet era saturated with \"manosphere\" influencers and \"trad wife\" content, which often urges women to embrace homemaking and submit to their husbands, Marina's \"Cuntissimo\" is a much-needed dose of ostentatious girl power.\n\n\"So often, women don't think they're allowed to feel their sexuality in a way that doesn't involve how it looks for men. They feel that it's been co-opted,\" Marina said of the song, via Dork. \"I would love to be able to free younger women of that, the feeling that our bodies don't quite belong to us.\"\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Cupid's Girl,\" \"Metallic Stallion,\" \"I <3 You\"\n\nTyler, the Creator had very clear objectives with his ninth studio album, \"Don't Tap the Glass\" — namely, to make people ditch their phones and dance. In the album's opening track, Tyler instructs the audience, \"Body movement. No sitting still.\"\n\nThe very next song, \"Sugar On My Tongue,\" is Tyler's vision fulfilled. I can't imagine anyone with sturdy feet and healthy knees being able to resist that beat.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Big Poe (feat. Sk8brd),\" \"Sucka Free,\" \"Ring Ring Ring\"\n\nJoe Keery may star in one of Netflix's most popular shows ever (as the beloved Steve Harrington in \"Stranger Things\"), but if the quality of his music maintains its current trajectory, he'll be better known as a musician in no time.\n\nThis year, Keery released his third album, \"The Crux,\" under his stage name Djo. It was led by the endearingly retro \"Basic Being Basic,\" in which Keery makes the case for being earnest over trying to be cool.\n\nThe song toes the line between lecture and confession, while Keery's delivery alternates between monotone and falsetto. Here, as well as elsewhere in \"The Crux,\" he's taking cues from frontmen like Matty Healy, Julian Casablancas, John McCrea, and Paul McCartney — but the result is a sound that's entirely his own.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Potion,\" \"Delete Ya,\" \"Charlie's Garden\"\n\nJustin Bieber is back, baby. \"Daisies\" is the infectious highlight from \"Swag,\" Bieber's best album in a decade, and the song of the summer that got away.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Yukon,\" \"Butterflies,\" \"Walking Away\"\n\nIn \"Tears,\" the second single from Sabrina Carpenter's \"Man's Best Friend,\" she takes a man to task — or, more accurately, modern men as a species — for how far underground the bar for seduction has sunk.\n\nHer sarcastic fawning over the bare minimum (\"A little respect for women can get you very, very far / Remembering how to use your phone gets me oh so, oh so, oh so hot!\") is paired with irresistible disco-pop, making a strong case for Carpenter as Donna Summer's saucy offspring.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Manchild,\" \"Nobody's Son,\" \"House Tour\"\n\nKatseye, a six-piece girl group positioned as the first global K-pop phenomenon, enjoyed a mainstream breakout moment amid the great jeans war of 2025. The group went viral for dancing to \"Milkshake\" by Kelis in Gap's \"Better in Denim\" campaign, which the company's CEO touted as a financial boon and \"cultural takeover.\"\n\nThe ad's success on social media showcased Katseye's zeitgeisty star power, but \"Gabriela\" proves the group has staying power as well. The top-40 single features a cowriting credit from Charli XCX, a juicy romantic rival motif à la Dolly Parton's \"Jolene,\" a flamenco-inspired hook, and a bridge sung entirely in Spanish — a seemingly chaotic mix of elements somehow blended to perfection. \"Gabriela\" is one of the year's smoothest, most indelible pop songs, destined to soundtrack Katseye's ongoing rise to stardom.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Gameboy,\" \"Mean Girls,\" \"M.I.A\"\n\nKevin Parker's fifth album as Tame Impala, \"Deadbeat,\" was heavily inspired by the rave scene in Western Australia, a mood neatly summarized in its third single: \"Run from the sunlight, Dracula.\" The album's narrator thrives in the shadowy, faceless corners of a dance floor.\n\nShortly after its September release, \"Dracula\" became the first Tame Impala song ever to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 — a shockingly overdue achievement, but one that \"Dracula\" earned with its sticky hook and party-ready production. Parker even told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he wanted \"Dracula\" to sound \"like a Max Martin song,\" referencing the legendary pop producer who's churned out more hits than anyone else in this century.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"My Old Ways,\" \"Loser,\" \"Obsolete\"\n\nJustin Vernon said his acclaimed fifth album as Bon Iver, \"Sable, Fable,\" took shape on the day he wrote \"Everything Is Peaceful Love,\" a soft-rock ballad awash in the musician's signature falsetto.\n\n\"I knew what kind of record I wanted to make the day we made 'Everything Is Peaceful Love.' I always knew that would be the feeling I wanted to share first,\" Vernon said in a statement. \"The idea that happiness and joy are the highest form and the true buoyancy of survival, and even taking yourself less seriously could heal the world.\"\n\nIf that claim sounds a bit starry-eyed, the song is sincere and soothing enough to almost make you believe it. \"Everything Is Peaceful Love\" is the sonic equivalent of taking a warm bath; whatever's going on above water level tends to melt away mercifully, if only for a few minutes.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Things Behind Things Behind Things,\" \"Walk Home,\" \"There's a Rhythmn\"\n\nIt's tempting to attribute the success of \"Sally, When the Wine Runs Out,\" a surprise hit from the deluxe version of Role Model's sophomore album, \"Kansas Anymore,\" to a series of viral live renditions.\n\nDuring early performances of the song, Role Model would invite fans onstage to play Sally during the song's chant-along bridge (\"Heard through the grapevine, she can be a diva / Cold like Minnesota, hotter than a fever\").\n\nAs the tradition gained traction on social media, Role Model began recruiting fellow musicians and celebrities to play the role. The prestigious list has grown to reflect his rising rank in Hollywood, featuring everyone from Olivia Rodrigo and Charli XCX to Kate Hudson and Natalie Portman.\n\nIt's the latest iteration of the special guest concert gimmick, following in the shrewd footsteps of Justin Bieber's \"One Less Lonely Girl\" serenades, MUNA's \"Silk Chiffon\" cameos, and, more recently, Sabrina Carpenter's \"Juno\" arrests. But the truth is, a concert gimmick only catches on if the song is actually good, and \"Sally\" is very good. It's annoyingly charming — easy to memorize and near impossible to shake off.\n\nIt has also become a career-shifting hit for Role Model, who was largely unknown just one year ago. Now, when he gets onstage, he greets his fans with a shriek-inducing, \"Hey, divas,\" and they eat it up every time. Through his adoring lens, who wouldn't want to be Sally?\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Look at That Woman,\" \"Old Recliners,\" \"Some Protector\"\n\nRaye has not misfired once since becoming an independent artist in 2021. Following last year's audacious single \"Genesis,\" her latest offering is a gorgeous blend of humor, theatrics, and intimacy.\n\n\"Where Is My Husband!\" feels like gossiping with friends over cocktails, in that it understands the joy of complaining and commiserating. Raye is tired of searching for her lifelong partner, a topic that many artists might plumb for a mournful ballad — but she refuses to succumb to dating doomerism.\n\nInstead, Raye copes by cracking jokes and keeping her eyes on the prize, transforming her exasperated yearning into playful teasing (\"Wait 'til I get my hands on him, I'ma tell him off too / For how long he kept me waiting\"). She may be impatient, but she's far from hopeless.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Suzanne\"\n\n\"Buckle\" is the soft heart of Florence + The Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\" The track was cowritten by Florence Welch and Mitski, two women who are renowned for unspooling uncomfortable and raw truths in their music. Naturally, their team-up yielded an exquisite piece of lyricism.\n\nWhile the bulk of \"Everybody Scream\" leans baroque and bombastic, with \"Buckle,\" Welch and her co-producer, Aaron Dessner, smartly strip down the production. Backed by an acoustic guitar, Welch wrestles with degradation, desire, and the addictive cycle of rejection and resolution, interrupting her own spiral with a poignant wail: \"Oh god, I thought I was too old for this.\"\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"One of the Greats,\" \"Perfume and Milk,\" \"Music by Men\"\n\n\"It's a Mirror\" by Perfume Genius, aka Mike Hadreas, sounds confident and robust, yet lyrically, the song is fearful and fragile. The narrator is trapped inside his home and inside his mind, terrified that real life is happening somewhere else out of reach. He peers out his window, but can't bring himself to leave.\n\nHadreas describes this threshold as a kind of portal, a thin barrier between safety and curiosity, akin to Lewis Carroll's famous looking glass. \"It's a Mirror,\" indeed.\n\n\"It's a soup of all the things I was thinking about the last few years, the things I ended up talking about across the album,\" Hadreas told Stereogum of the song. \"I like when things are loud, big, but the sentiment is what some people would think of as softer, more tender. That tension is satisfying to me.\"\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Me & Angel,\" \"Full On,\" \"Capezio\"\n\nIn between her third and fourth studio albums, \"Eusexua\" and \"Eusexua Afterglow,\" FKA twigs released \"Perfectly,\" a clubby ode to self-actualization.\n\nTwigs gives herself — and, by extension, her listeners — free license to be messy, even a little delusional, especially if it means having more fun. \"Inside my head, I have the best time,\" she sings, abolishing shame with a simple, elegant mantra.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Girl Feels Good,\" \"Cheap Hotel,\" \"Sushi\"\n\nEven on Taylor Swift's most divisive albums, her songwriting skill can't help but shine through.\n\nSwift is a master at pairing her personal lyrics with mass-appeal-optimized melodies. Of course, it's true that popularity and profit don't always (or even usually) correlate with high quality. But it's also true that successful pop songwriting — communicating knotty emotions and layered narratives in a way that resonates with a large number of people — is terribly difficult. Swift just makes it look easy.\n\n\"Elizabeth Taylor\" is one such example from Swift's extensive catalog, and the best from \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\n\nSure, \"The Fate of Ophelia\" is the album's major Billboard hit and \"Opalite\" is favored by TikTok choreographers, but \"Elizabeth Taylor\" has all the glamour, friction, lust, and drama that one should expect from a self-professed showgirl — the view of Portofino, the rustle of paparazzi, the buzz of a love affair that's about to hit the front page. The song's rich visuals and snappy one-liners (\"They say I'm bad news, I just say, 'Thanks') are complemented by its lavish, orchestral-pop production. And don't even get me started on the beat drop in the chorus.\n\nSwift and her coproducers, Max Martin and Shellback, went all out for this song, leaning into the extravagance that its namesake evokes — and thank goodness they did. Nonchalance has never been Swift's forté.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" \"Opalite,\" \"Father Figure\"\n\nFollowing the slow-burn success of her 2023 debut, \"The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,\" Chappell Roan has maintained her grip on pop culture with a steady stream of singles: Last year's much-loved \"Good Luck, Babe!\" was followed by this year's one-two punch, \"The Giver\" and \"The Subway.\"\n\nThe latter became Roan's first top-three hit on the Hot 100 and received two Grammy nominations, including record of the year. The song even sparked a tourism boom in Saskatchewan, the Canadian prairie province that Roan name-drops as her post-heartbreak contingency plan.\n\nEach and every accolade, however wacky, is well deserved. \"The Subway\" is the kind of torch song that immediately sounds like a classic, at once fresh and familiar. Roan delivers each line with such passion, such palpable yearning, that every time she reaches the anthemic outro (\"She's got a way, she's got a way / And she got, she got away\"), no matter where I am, I'm seized by an urge to sway a lighter in the air.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"The Giver\"\n\n\"Relationships\" was the first taste of Haim's fourth album, \"I Quit,\" which both laments and celebrates single womanhood.\n\nThis ambivalence is presented frankly in the lead single. \"I think I'm in love, but I can't stand fucking relationships,\" Danielle, the band's lead vocalist and middle sister, repeats throughout the song.\n\nIn the outro, the qualifying phrase changes shape (\"I think I'm in love, but I can't stand communicating it,\" \"I think I'm in love, so why am I trying to escape from it?\"), teasing out shades of annoyance, exhaustion, panic, and avoidance as her relationship collapses. At the root of it all, the singer is plagued by a gut feeling that something isn't quite right — that there's something that love can't overcome.\n\nThe song offers no sense of resolve or resolution, and its circular logic is mirrored in the fuzzy, funky production. I could ask myself the titular question over and over without reaching any conclusions, just as no amount of replaying this song seems to satisfy me.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"All Over Me,\" \"Down to Be Wrong,\" \"Everybody's Trying to Figure Me Out\"\n\nOlivia Dean's breezy, soulful breakthrough single serves as a balm for the rejection-filled world of modern dating.\n\nJournalists, podcasters, and psychologists alike are tripping over each other to diagnose and cure the woes of modern courtship. This very list features a variety of reactions and coping mechanisms: Marina refuses to sacrifice her independence, Sabrina Carpenter openly mocks her suitors, and Raye opts for restless optimism.\n\nMeanwhile, Dean has a cleaner approach: \"We could be nice to each other.\"\n\nEven as she's realistic about the challenges and miseries that accompany desire, and even though she doesn't want a boyfriend (a fact she proudly declares in the song's third verse), Dean is resolutely hopeful about our capacity for kindness, about the tenderness required for true human connection. Her lyrics suggest there are no road maps, no easy answers, and certainly no guarantees in matters of the heart. Still, she insists, that doesn't mean our hearts have to wither and harden.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Lady Lady,\" \"So Easy (To Fall In Love),\" \"Man I Need\"\n\nTraditionally, I've been opposed to including songs from the previous year in a list like this, even if they arrived too late for last year's ranking.\n\nI'm breaking this informal rule for \"Luther,\" which was released on Kendrick Lamar's 2024 album \"GNX,\" for two reasons.\n\nThe first is that \"Luther\" deserves to be immortalized as a defining song of 2025. After Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show, \"Luther\" rose to No. 1 on the Hot 100 and stayed there for 13 consecutive weeks. It's one of just 47 songs in history to secure a double-digit reign on the chart, and the fact that it reached this milestone several months after its release speaks to its enduring and timeless appeal. (In decades past, this may not have been notable. But in the streaming era, our cultural attention span is shorter than ever.)\n\nThe second reason is more important: The song is just that good. \"Luther\" is the crown jewel of Lamar's longtime creative synergy with SZA, and considering how their duets also include classics like \"Babylon,\" \"Doves In the Wind,\" and the Oscar-nominated \"All the Stars,\" that's no easy distinction. It's the result of two living legends at the top of their game.\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Man at the Garden,\" \"Hey Now (feat. Dody6),\" \"Gloria (with SZA)\"\n\nWhile finalizing her fourth studio album, \"Virgin,\" Lorde repeatedly teased fans with a tagline: \"After the Ecstasy, the Laundry,\" taken from a book about spiritual enlightenment by Jack Kornfield.\n\nHer album's climactic closer, \"David,\" could be summarized with the same five words. After the spilled secrets, the reckless worship, and the drug-like high of falling in love with the wrong person, Lorde returns to reality, left alone with the mess of independence. \"I don't belong to anyone,\" she crows, apparently in triumph, though she presents a more sobering vision in the outro: \"Am I ever gonna love again? Am I ever gonna love again? Am I ever gonna love again?\"\n\nMichelangelo's David is known for his pure, scratchless, perfect form, but Lorde inverts this image. Making art is all about chipping away at what doesn't work, finding a recognizable shape within the random chunks of material; with songs, unlike with sculptures, the artist mines her own flesh. Where the beauty of Michelangelo's David is immortal and unattainable, the beauty of Lorde's \"David\" is willfully human, leaving the listener with the taste of metal and salt on their tongue.\n\n\"The body that made this album bleeds and aches and sheds,\" Lorde told Zane Lowe. \"I really tried as hard as I could to make this without shame.\"\n\nIf you like this, listen to: \"Shapeshifter,\" \"Favourite Daughter,\" \"Current Affairs\"",

    "title": "Inflation unexpectedly slowed in November in what may be a 'distorted' first release since the government shutdown",
    "description": "The consumer price index increased 2.7%, short of the forecast and September's 3% rise.",
    "fullText": "The year-over-year inflation rate slowed to 2.7% in November, down from 3% in September, the last month for which data is available.\n\nEconomists expected a 3.1% rate, which would have been the highest since May 2024.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics won't be able to calculate an overall consumer price index for October 2025 because the government shutdown that lasted from October to roughly mid-November affected data collection.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference earlier this month that inflation and the labor market data would be \"distorted\" and should be viewed with a \"skeptical eye.\"\n\nThe Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6% from a year ago in November, below the 3% forecast and the 3% year-over-year rise in September.\n\nThe food index also increased by 2.6% over the year in November, which is lower than the 3.1% rise in September. Food away from home, such as at restaurants, rose more quickly than food at home, such as groceries, increasing by 3.7% and 1.9%, respectively.\n\nThe shelter index, which had generally been rising at a slower rate, rose 3% year over year in November, far below September's 3.6% increase.\n\nEarlier this week, the BLS also published October and November job growth data, as well as last month's unemployment rate, providing more clarity to the state of the economy after a murky data picture due to delayed or canceled government data releases. This delayed report revealed a mixed labor market, characterized by better-than-expected job growth, unemployment rate above that in September, and slowing wage growth.\n\nBoth reports will be helpful for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. Before the CPI release, CME FedWatch showed a roughly 75% chance that the Fed would hold rates steady, after three straight cuts, and about a 25% chance of a 25-basis-point cut. The probabilities didn't change that much after the release, shifting to about 71% and about 29%, respectively.\n\n\"Today's low inflation reading won't move the needle for the Fed given how noisy the data is,\" Kay Haigh, global cohead of Fixed Income and Liquidity Solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee members, who make the federal funds rate decision, won't meet again until January 27 and January 28, so they will have even more labor market and inflation information before then to make their call.\n\n\"All told this is a positive report, that comes with an asterisk. Subsequent CPI's will likely smooth out the statistical errors that might have been present in today's report,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist for B. Riley Wealth, said.",

    "fullText": "Blackstone's annual holiday video — a tongue-in-cheek Wall Street tradition — is out, and this year's edition turns its trademark self-mockery toward the firm's 40th anniversary.\n\nPresident Jon Gray starts the video off with a Ken Burns-style tribute to the firm's 40th anniversary, before firing the actual Ken Burns, going through a midlife crisis, and ending with a 1980s musical number.\n\nDanny DeVito makes an appearance with a half-hearted Blackstone commercial that's apparently part of his Jersey Mike's contract.\n\nCome for CEO Steve Schwarzman's jokes about picking up DJing as a hobby, a bit that features Goldman Sachs head David Solomon, and stay for a perfect \"Dirty Dancing\" lift executed by one of the firm's executives.\n\nGray told analyst Alex Blostein earlier this month at the Goldman Sachs Financial Analyst conference that the video is a way for the world's largest private investor to \"make fun of ourselves.\" The firm's video operations, from Gray's \"ridiculous\" running videos to its Monday morning BXTV meetings, also serve a broader purpose to \"humanize\" the firm to its growing list of shareholders and investors: 300,000 by Gray's count.",

    "fullText": "HELSINKI, Finland (AP) — Finland’s government is facing heavy pressure and accusations of racism from several Asian countries after its representative to the 2025 Miss Universe pageant was seen pulling the corners of her eyes in a photo -- and some Finnish politicians posted their own photos repeating the gesture.\n\nSarah Dzafce lost her Miss Finland crown last week after a photo of Dzafce pulling the skin at the corners of her eyes posted on social media went viral late last month. The photo, and its caption reading “eating with a Chinese,” was decried by governments and commentators across Finland and Asia as discrimination against Asians.\n\nDzafce, who won Miss Finland in September, has told Finnish media that she was trying to alleviate a headache. The Helsinki Times reported that she said a friend had shared the private image and wrote the caption without her input. Dzafce did not respond to The Associated Press's request for comment Thursday.\n\nDzafce posted an apology to social media on Dec. 8 and said it was never her intention to hurt anyone.\n\n“The Miss Finland title is not just a crown for me, but also a responsibility. A responsibility for how I speak, how I act, and how my actions can affect people,” she wrote in Finnish.\n\nShe added: “I take responsibility for my actions and will learn from this.”\n\nDays later, the Miss Finland Organization revoked her status as Miss Finland 2025 — known as Miss Suomi in Finnish.\n\n“The events of recent days have caused deep hurt, disappointment, and concern both in Finland and internationally — fully understandably,” the organization wrote on social media. “We are deeply sorry for the harm these events have caused. Especially to the Asian community, but also to everyone affected. Racism is never acceptable in any form.”\n\nThe controversy snowballed when several far-right Finnish politicians rallied around Dzafce after she lost her crown. Members of the parliament who are part of the ruling coalition posted their own photos of them pulling the skin around their eyes.\n\nThe furor has spread throughout Asia, prompting Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo to issue an apology to several countries, including Japan and South Korea, through statements in their languages posted to Finnish embassy social media accounts.\n\n“These posts do not reflect Finland’s values of equality and inclusion,” Orpo's statement said. \"Racism and discrimination have no place in Finnish society. Our message in Finland and to all our friends abroad is that the Government takes racism seriously and is committed to combat the issue. Finland always aims to do better. Politicians have a responsibility to serve as examples in this respect.”\n\nJapan’s government has reached out to the Finnish embassy in Tokyo expressing its concerns.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara, the government's top spokesperson, said Japan hopes to maintain close communication with Helsinki.\n\n“I understand that Finnish Prime Minister issued a statement expressing his deepest apology for the recent insulting posts made on social media by some parliamentarians,” Kihara said. “As the Japanese government, we have conveyed via the local embassy our concern about the case and expectations for an appropriate response.”\n\nFinland is a major tourist destination for visitors from Asia, and some users on social platform X have called for a boycott of travel to Finland and of Finnair, the country's largest airline.\n\nPäivyt Tallqvist, the airline’s senior vice president of communications, told Finnish broadcaster Yle that the scandal has hurt the company's international operations without providing details.",

One deputy was struck in the arm and taken by a medical helicopter to UVA Health in Charlottesville for treatment. The deputy’s injuries were not life-threatening.\n\nThe sheriff's office reported earlier that deputies were attempting to serve an arrest warrant on the suspect in the 800 block of Parkersburg Turnpike. When the deputies arrived, they encountered the wanted suspect and a physical altercation took place.\n\n“I can confirm that we have had an officer involved shooting. I have turned the scene and the investigation over to the Virginia State Police, Bureau of Criminal Investigations, Appomattox Division,” said Sheriff Donald L.

    "description": "AI can mine social media, online reviews, and internal feedback to uncover what customers and current and former employees say about the company.",
    "fullText": "Before applying for a position, job seekers often want to know factors beyond the role's responsibilities, like a company's values, employee experience, and growth opportunities. Like many areas of the workforce, artificial intelligence can help with this.\n\nBrand image \"sets the tone for how people view your company long before they ever interact with you,\" says Victoria Bracco, CEO of Encore Media Agency and cofounder of the Strategic Executive Alliance, a business consulting firm. It gives job candidates \"clarity, confidence, and a sense of direction\" about whether an organization is a good fit.\n\n\"AI can make it easier for companies to understand how they're being perceived and where they need to improve,\" she adds.\n\nHuman resources leaders also see value in AI for talent acquisition. For instance, some companies, including Unilever and L'Oreal, use AI chatbots to answer job applicants' questions and provide personalized responses based on their preferences and skills.\n\nBeyond that, AI can help companies learn what job seekers think about them and use data-driven storytelling to attract talent, Bracco says. Here's how.\n\nBrand sentiment is composed of a range of inputs from a wide variety of sources, and AI can be a boon to consolidating, gathering, and analyzing that content.\n\nFor example, AI can mine social media, online reviews, and internal feedback to uncover what customers, the public, and current and former employees say about the company, known as a sentiment analysis, Bracco says.\n\nAI tools can also track metrics, such as employee sentiment and retention rates, as well as social media engagement, adds Kaz Hassan, principal of community and insights at Unily, an AI intranet software.\n\n\"AI can identify patterns in what current employees say about your organization, revealing brand strengths to amplify and weaknesses to address,\" Hassan says. \"This real-time intelligence allows companies to respond quickly to emerging issues before they become reputation problems.\"\n\nAI can synthesize several different data points, including brand sentiment, employee performance insights, and the skills the company currently needs. Using that information, AI can then help write job descriptions, career pages, and social media messaging that will resonate with the right candidates, Bracco says.\n\nOrganizations can also use employee data to showcase how they value their people, such as through internal upskilling, mobility rates, leadership styles, or employee check-ins, says Lana Peters, chief revenue and experience officer at Klaar, a performance management software.\n\nAI can \"shape an unbiased story,\" she says. That story should focus on \"culture, purpose, and growth,\" Bracco adds.\n\nJust make sure the story is authentic and honest; coming across as disingenuous is a turn-off, adds Polina Dimitrova, global head of people at Make, a visual development platform. \"The truth is: your brand is how you hire, how you develop people, how leaders behave, and where your teams show up in the world.\"\n\nThis can illustrate \"the employee experience you offer as a company,\" says Tom Moran, CEO of Addison Group, a staffing and recruiting firm.\n\n\"Real stories from real people within the organization discussing their experiences within the organization will resonate with job seekers,\" Hassan says.\n\nPeters adds that, \"Candidates aren't just choosing a job; they're choosing a story they want to be a part of,\" including companies whose values align with theirs and where they'll be recognized and appreciated.\n\nHowever, AI isn't the \"end-all, be-all,\" Dimitrova says. It should be used to optimize brands for attracting talent; it's not a substitute for a brand strategy, Bracco adds.\n\nAI is there to \"speed things up and provide insights, but the final message still needs and must have your voice, your judgment, and your direction,\" Bracco says. \"Keep the human side front and center, because candidates can spot a forced or overly polished message a mile away.\"",

The local sheriff’s department confirmed that there were multiple fatalities, according to the AP\n\nRon Smith, Statesville’s city manager, confirmed during a press conference on Thursday that there had been a crash at the airport, but did not provide any further information on the cause of the crash or how many people may have died.\n\nAirport manager John Ferguson said the Federal Aviation Administration had taken over the scene and was leading the investigation into the crash. The airport will be closed until further notice, he said.\n\nPublic records reportedly show that the plane involved was owned by an aviation company controlled by NASCAR star Greg Biffle, according to local TV station WSOC-TV. The airport says on its website that it “provides corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams.”\n\nIt is not known who may have been on the plane when it crashed, the station said.\n\nAccording to tracking data from the website FlightAware, the plane took off from Statesville Airport at 10:06 a.m. before abruptly looping back toward the airport. The plane was a Cessna C550 owned by GB Aviation Leasing. The address listed on the FAA registry for the plane matches an address for Biffle in Mooresville, North Carolina, Yahoo Sports has confirmed.\n\nBiffle is a licensed pilot who used his helicopter skills to help people in remote areas of the state who were affected by the severe flooding caused by Hurricane Helene last year.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

    "fullText": "Coca-Cola is under the microscope as experts sound the alarm over the drink's health risks.\n\nWhile the sugar content in soda is no surprise, researchers are now pinpointing exactly what happens to your body when you drink a can of regular Coca-Cola.\n\nNew studies are scrutinizing Coca-Cola, as researchers are linking the drink to fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, The Telegraph reported.\n\nA study published in Nature Medicine, for example, linked millions of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease cases to sugar-based beverages. Likewise, a study conducted by a group of Swedish researchers has gone so far as to directly condemn the sugar drink industry for cases of cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhen you drink a can of regular Coca-Cola, your body experiences a sugar rush within the first hour of consumption. Since Coca-Cola contains caffeine as well as sugar, drinking soda consistently can also cause you to develop a \"degree of dependence,\" per the Telegraph. This dependency can then cause some consistent cola drinkers to \"wean themselves off it gradually to lessen the effects of the caffeine and sugar withdrawal.\"\n\nThe new research reinforces the health risks of regularly drinking Coca-Cola. What's worse, in the United Kingdom, experts are also calling out the country's food labeling system, which gives Coca-Cola three green traffic lights, a label that is misleading for consumers.\n\n\"Coke is just through the roof [for sugar],\" specialist registered dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine told the Telegraph. \"In my opinion, it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.\"\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, Coca-Cola is the world's leading producer of branded plastic waste, and while the company has taken some steps to mitigate its plastic waste, it still has a significant way to go.\n\nResearchers are continuing to study the long-term impacts of drinking soda, adding to the growing pile of evidence underscoring the health risks.\n\nTo protect yourself from these risks, you can reduce your soda intake. Health experts also suggest swapping out that can of Coca-Cola for a healthier alternative, such as fizzy water.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Palmer Luckey wants you to know he was right all along.\n\nThe outspoken billionaire and new-age god of war is making a fortune selling weapons. His reach extends beyond the range of his powerful artillery though, as he has shifted the narrative around what working in defense tech means.\n\nOnce a somewhat taboo corner of the business world, the success of Luckey's Anduril Industries, along with his no-holds-barred approach to … just about everything, has made him the poster child for tech's new love affair with the military, writes BI's Julia Hornstein.\n\nLuckey's now on a victory lap of sorts as he shepherds the US into a new era where one of the biggest business battlefields is the literal battlefield.\n\nPart of Luckey's appeal in tech circles might be his authenticity.\n\nWhether you love him or hate him, the 33-year-old has stuck to his guns over the years. That's unlike most of his tech peers, who have shifted their businesses and policies to favor whichever political party is in power. (Luckey once said he wrote President Donald Trump a letter when he was 15, encouraging him to run for president.)\n\nAt times, that dedication has come at a cost. Luckey has long claimed he was fired from Meta in 2017 for supporting Trump. Meta denies he left over politics.\n\nBut these days it's all sunshine and rainbows cruise missiles and drones for Luckey.\n\nPalmer Luckey might be the face of defense tech, but he's got plenty of competition.\n\nFirst and foremost, there's more money than ever in the space thanks to the Trump administration leaning into defense spending.\n\nThe latest era of modern warfare is also creating new opportunities. The increased prominence of drones, as evident in the war in Ukraine, has given startups a chance to step up to the plate. It has created an interesting dynamic, with young, agile startups competing with traditional defense contractors.\n\nThe increased competition is largely viewed as a positive for the government, which can benefit from better pricing. The new players and cutting-edge tech are also speeding up processes.\n\nThe Navy said a Palantir-powered AI system for shipbuilding cut a 160-hour job to just 10 minutes. The Army is also enacting a \"fail fast\" approach to weapon development.\n\nMoving at such speed, a staple of Silicon Valley, comes with risks when dealing with such powerful and dangerous tech.

The mantelpiece was adorned with pine cones, candles, and a nutcracker figure.\n\nIt seemed like every inch of the house was covered with tinsel, snow globes, and other trinkets.\n\nIn March 2020, we moved to a larger place than our previous home, partly because we needed an extra bedroom for our new au pair from Chile.\n\nCOVID-19 struck a few days after her arrival. Things were grim, and I wanted to cheer everyone up. I wanted our guest to enjoy the Easter holiday.\n\nStores like HomeGoods weren't open, so I ordered things online, including egg and rabbit-shaped ornaments. Our au pair — and the kids, who were 12 and 10 at the time — appreciated the effort I made.\n\nI did a similar thing for Halloween. Then Christmas came along. I purchased a couple of fake deer for the lawn. Then there was the yard sign that spelled out \"Joy,\" and some oversize baubles to hang from the tree outside.\n\nDuring the winters of 2020 to 2024, it became \"my thing\" to buy holiday decor. It would take me ages to bring the stuff out of storage, but I didn't mind. It was fun to decorate.\n\nI haven't bought anything new this year, following strict instructions from my high school senior, who no longer shares my love of decorations. Still, she didn't stop me from going all out with the tchotchkes I already had.\n\nThen, all of a sudden, I felt claustrophobic and uncomfortable. How on earth had I managed to acquire all this junk?\n\nI thought of the new year clean-up when everything would need to be packed in boxes and stowed once again. It filled me with dread.\n\nThe feeling was enough to make me cringe. I was embarrassed by the stuff on display. It no longer seemed exciting to welcome guests when our home resembled a hoarder's.\n\nIt's too late to take the items down because I've got so much to do ahead of the holidays. I cannot face the bother of \"undecorating\" the house. It will have to wait until January.\n\nSome people hire professional declutterers. But they're too expensive for my budget.\n\nInstead, I've made a vow to spend an entire weekend sorting through my holiday decor after Christmas. I'll donate at least half to my Buy Nothing, Sell Nothing group on Facebook.\n\nIf nobody wants them, they're going in the trash. I never want my home to feel so cramped again.",

They also used a school-system quality metric based on previous WalletHub research.\n\nThe quality of life ranking took into account factors such as average commute time and work hours, as well as the number of restaurants, bars, clubs, and other attractions per capita. Each city's safety ranking was determined using rates like violent and property crime, car crashes, pedestrian deaths, and drug poisoning deaths.\n\nThe study utilized data from the US Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as data from companies such as Areavibes, TransUnion, TripAdvisor, Yelp, and WalletHub.\n\nOf the over 1,000 cities, 19 received scores that ranked in the top percentile across the various categories.\n\nSee the places that WalletHub ranked as being the top small cities in the US in 2025.\n\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, had the highest quality of life ranking among the top cities, placing within the top 10 nationwide.\n\nAlthough Arlington, Massachusetts — located six miles outside Boston — is among the top five most unaffordable cities in the top-performing cities, it ranked second-best in education and health out of all 1,318 cities in the study.\n\nLexington, Massachusetts, was ranked as having the best education and health in the nation in the study.

    "fullText": "An Alaska Airlines flight descended into chaos as passengers restrained a man who was trying to open an emergency exit, an affidavit says.\n\nThe incident occurred on last Wednesday's Flight 87 from Deadhorse, Alaska, to Anchorage, a journey that takes about an hour and a half.\n\nDuring the flight, several passengers had moved seats away from the passenger, named by police as Kassian Fredericks, after becoming concerned by his behavior.\n\nTwo men who sat behind him said they heard him talking to himself. One of them told investigators that he mentioned invisible people trying to take over the plane.\n\nHe then also took a pill and drank some Gatorade, the witness said.\n\nThe Boeing 737 had only been in the air for about eight minutes, climbing through 18,000 feet, when one of the pilots said he got the first call from the cabin crew about their concerns over a passenger's behavior.\n\nShortly after that, the pilot said, he saw the cockpit light indicating someone was trying to open the emergency exit.\n\nThe passenger had managed to move the door's arm upward when another passenger grabbed him.\n\nThey called for help, and another two passengers came to restrain him.\n\n\"[He] was so strong it took him and the other two male passengers to restrain him and sit him down,\" the affidavit says.\n\nWhile it is a frightening situation, it's actually impossible to open a plane door at a high altitude, because the pressure differences inside and outside the aircraft keep the door sealed.\n\nFredericks is then said to have requested a cigarette, asked about how to break a plane's window, and said he wanted to call his mom.\n\nWhen one of the passengers asked him why he was trying to open the door, he is said to have replied that he \"needed air and to get out of here.\"\n\nThe pilot had considered diverting to an airfield in nearby Fairbanks, but continued onto Anchorage as they were only 18 minutes away, per the affidavit.\n\nLocal police then boarded the plane and arrested the passenger.\n\nAfter landing, the affidavit says, he appeared to have calmed down as he apologized to the crew while he was being escorted away.\n\nFredericks was indicted by a grand jury on Tuesday and charged with one count of interference with a flight crew, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 20 years.\n\nAlaska Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Markets took in a cooler-than-expected inflation report on Thursday, which nudged the odds of another rate cut by March slightly higher.",
    "fullText": "Stock investors got two pieces of good news on Thursday.\n\nUS stocks jumped as investors took in a cooler-than-expected inflation report, bolstering confidence in the economy and lifting hopes that the Fed will continue its rate-cutting cycle heading into next year.\n\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, lower than the 3.1% annualized increase economists were expecting.\n\nMeanwhile, the tech sector got a break after days of weakness. Chip stocks, led largely by Micron Technology, which jumped as much as 14%. The chipmaker reported strong earnings and issued robust guidance, helping to erase some losses from Wednesday's session.\n\nMajor indexes rose in the early morning and surged on the CPI release. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the tech sector:\n\nThe latest CPI data is a much-needed piece of good news for the market, which has been under pressure as investors take stock of high valuations and sort through their queasy feelings about the AI sector.\n\nCooler inflation, combined with a weaker US job market, has widened the path for the Fed to continue its cutting rates in 2026. The odds that the central bank will cut rates another 25 basis points by March edged higher after the CPI data.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield dropped to around 4.1% on Thursday.\n\n\"The inflation bump from tariffs is behind us, so the path is now clear for the Fed to lower rates again in January. There is no longer a case for restrictive monetary policy,\" Jamie Cox, a managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said in a statement.\n\nStephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, said the latest CPI reading suggested the Fed may already be ahead of its inflation targets for the next year.\n\n\"The numbers this morning helped support the Fed narrative that the risks to the job market were rising faster than the risks to inflation,\" Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, wrote in a note.\n\nMicron, meanwhile, soothed investors' anxieties in the AI sector, as the chipmaker reported $13.6 billion in revenue, exceeding the $12.8 billion Wall Street had expected.\n\nThe company said that it expects to pull around $18.7 billion in revenue for the current quarter, higher than the $14.2 billion analysts had pencilled in.\n\nInvestors are interpreting the results as another bit of evidence that AI chip demand is still strong. The news is quelling some anxiety over massive amounts of spending being poured into AI, which sparked a sell-off yesterday on a Financial Times report that said Blue Owl Capital had backed out of a $10 billion data center deal with Oracle.\n\n\"MU's double-digit percentage pre-market gain has investors breathing a sigh of relief, but you can't fault anyone for being a little cynical after seeing how some other AI-related stocks recently performed in reaction to what, at face value, looked like impressive reports,\" Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said.",

    "description": "Henley & Partners say data shows wealthy families shifting plans as private healthcare costs surge worldwide and cheaper European options gain appeal.",
    "fullText": "A surge in global wealth migration seems to be colliding with an overlooked but increasingly decisive factor: the soaring cost of private healthcare.\n\nHenley & Partners, an investment migration firm, said its client data and new cost comparisons from a global health index show wealthy families are no longer choosing where to live solely on tax or lifestyle, but are increasingly factoring in the long-term cost of private healthcare.\n\nThe firm said in a press release this month that it has received applications from 92 nationalities in 2025, supporting clients across more than 50 residence and citizenship programs.\n\nApplications jumped 43% year-over-year in the first three quarters of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, it said.\n\n\"Global mobility is becoming a core risk-management strategy for wealthy families,\" said Christian H. Kaelin, the firm's chairman. Clients \"are scrutinizing not only access to residence and citizenship, but also the real cost of sustaining that lifestyle — especially the price of reliable private healthcare.\"\n\n\"Destinations that look attractive on paper can become far less so once true healthcare exposure is understood,\" he added.\n\nHenley & Partners cited the SIP Health Cost Index 2025, from the SIP Medical Family Office in Switzerland, a global benchmark released earlier this month, which ranks 50 countries by the true cost of private healthcare using international private medical insurance (IPMI) premiums as of August 2025.\n\nIn Europe, the UK ($11,726) and Greece ($9,654) sit at the pricier end due in part to insurance taxes, it said. while Switzerland ranks mid-table at $8,912. The UAE ranks 10th globally, with an average of $9,680.\n\nSome of the mid-range markets include South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Monaco, which range from roughly $7,100 to $7,600.\n\nKevin Bürchler, CEO of SIP Medical Family Office, which is behind the SIP Health Cost Index 2025, said inflation in private healthcare \"is rising worldwide, but the pace and pattern differ dramatically.\"\n\nSpeaking to Business Insider, he pointed to \"value\" destinations such as Italy, Portugal, and Austria, which offer lower costs and proximity to top-tier medical hubs like Switzerland and Germany.\n\nWhile ultra-high-net-worth individuals can absorb steep premiums, the cost gap matters for affluent families, especially those planning toward retirement, he said.\n\n\"It can make a significant difference whether you pay $30,000 plus for private health insurance versus $10,000,\" or whether \"a doctor consultation costs $500 or $50,\" he added.\n\nThat pressure, among other factors, is reshaping behavior, especially among Americans.\n\n\"US citizens were 5% of our client base in 2018, whereas today they comprise 40%,\" Basil Mohr-Elzeki, managing partner at Henley & Partners North America, told Business Insider — a shift he described as part of a broader hedge that includes healthcare resilience.\n\nHe said healthcare costs are explicitly cited in at least 15% of client decisions, making it a top-five factor behind geopolitical risk, global mobility, legacy planning, and tax optimization.\n\nInterest is rising in Portugal, Italy, Greece, Malta, and in cost-effective Latin American options such as Panama and Costa Rica, he said, adding that Turkey also attracts clients for affordable private medical tourism.\n\nMohr-Elzeki said many aging clients are increasingly seeking alternative healthcare options abroad — not only because of the cost, but also to access different medical opinions and treatments outside the US system, which he said, while \"top-tier,\" may have a \"commercial bias.\"\n\nHenley & Partners said the SIP Index is helping clients \"avoid hidden high-cost traps\" as healthcare becomes a central part of global mobility planning.",

    "description": "TikTok is telling many US staffers they will need to be in the office five days a week starting in September 2026.",
    "fullText": "For many TikTok employees, the days of working from home are numbered.\n\nThe company has told US staffers across several large divisions that they will need to return to the office five days a week next year, two affected workers told Business Insider.\n\nThe return-to-office push, which kicks off in September, will affect US employees across a wide set of roles, including staffers who work on advertising sales, marketing, and product, the employees said. A third staffer said they expected that much of TikTok's US cohort would be back in the office five days a week next year.\n\nTikTok and its owner, ByteDance, set in-office attendance rules by team. The company's e-commerce division, TikTok Shop, already has a five-day return-to-office requirement that at one point involved tracking the number of hours workers were physically in the office, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRTO is very much in vogue across corporate America. After easing up on in-office requirements during the pandemic, companies like Dell, JPMorgan, and Amazon have all ramped up in-office mandates over the past couple of years.\n\nTikTok competitor Instagram announced plans to bring US workers back into the office five days a week beginning in February.\n\n\"I believe that we are more creative and collaborative when we are together in-person,\" Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri wrote in a memo explaining the policy.\n\nOther companies like Spotify have been more lenient about RTO. The company's former HR chief said last year that its work-from-anywhere policy was rooted in the idea that \"you can't spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children.\"\n\nThe idea of returning to the office full-time has sparked mixed reactions among workers, both inside and outside TikTok. Young employees who started their careers working from home during the pandemic have begun romanticizing the idea of commuting to work in social-media posts, for example. On the flip side, there's Amazon, which has taken a more aggressive approach to RTO by forcing staffers to relocate to hubs, and has struggled to recruit new hires, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nSome executives view their employees' attitudes toward RTO as a signal of their alignment with the company.\n\nAfter AT&T instituted a five-day RTO earlier this year, CEO John Stankey said in August that workers who felt virtual or hybrid work was \"essential\" would have trouble aligning their priorities with the company and its culture.\n\nTikTok's RTO plans, set for the end of 2026, could change if the company winds up selling its US business to a new owner next year. Its current owner, ByteDance, is required to sell most of its US assets to comply with a divestment law passed in 2024.\n\nIn September, the Trump administration said it was prepared to approve a $14 billion sale of the US business to a buyer consortium that could include Oracle, its executive chairman Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, and Rupert Murdoch.\n\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment.",

This year, there are more opportunities than ever to flip over the stone that is your phone habits and see what crawls out.\n\nLast year, my top artist was Florence + The Machine. I stand by it; \"What Kind of Man\" is one of the best songs ever written. But why was I craving Florence Welch's scream about heartbreak and lust so desperately? What did that say about me?\n\nThis year, I can get rundowns from Dunkin' and Snapchat and YouTube. My colleague Sydney Bradley asked for a LinkedIn Wrapped — and then it appeared in my home feed.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" made a sketch about the embarrassing potential of Uber Eats Wrapped. Then the company released it for real, just called YOUBER.\n\nScrolling these rundowns is starting to feel less like fun and more like a psychological evaluation. Here's what I learned from my roster of recaps.\n\nThanks, LinkedIn, for letting me know that I have \"true daytime energy\" (as in: I use the app between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m.).\n\n2025 has been my year of becoming a LinkedInfluencer. Some of it is to develop connections and find new stories; some of it is to promote my work.

I didn't need to know that I was in the top 5% of LinkedIn users.\n\nIt's always a bit concerning to know that I'm being perceived. Knowing my profile was viewed 4,248 times? Woof.\n\nLike most of these recaps, LinkedIn tried to give me a title. I got the \"Catalyst,\" known for putting myself out there.\n\nMany of my colleagues also got this title. I think it's just because we post, unlike the majority of my friends, who use LinkedIn to stalk their Hinge dates.\n\nI used to be a big YouTube watcher. Now, I mostly use the platform to watch NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts and compilations of my favorite Bravo shows.\n\nI had never thought much about it, though, until my YouTube Recap showed my top interest was \"Reality TV recaps.\" Oh no.\n\nIt kept getting worse. I was in the top 0.3% of viewers for a small \"Real Housewives\" compilation maker I like. It's not my fault that \"Real Housewives moments that haunt me at 3 a.m.\" is perfect 3 a.m. viewing!\n\nAnd then, the bombshell: My award was \"most likely to quote iconic TV moments at the most random times.\"\n\nYou don't need to rub it in my face, YouTube.\n\nYouTube's descriptors for me were \"cultured,\" \"observant,\" and \"entertained.\" Entertained? On YouTube? I would hope so.\n\nI was named \"The Connector\" because I was \"drawn to content that sparks conversations and builds community.\"\n\nYouTube's first example of that: reality TV recaps. Well, fine.\n\nYou're looking at a guy who listened to 27,999 minutes of podcasts this year. That's 19 days' worth. Dear God.\n\nI listen to podcasts everywhere. I listen to them going to and from work. I listen to them in the shower. I listen to them when I fall asleep at night. Did I need to know how many minutes that was? No.\n\nThen came my top artists. I live in Brooklyn, where everyone keeps telling me about the tiny artist they've been streaming forever that everyone's just coming around to. (Please, do not talk to me about Geese.) Compared to that, my taste felt basic.\n\nMy top artist was Lady Gaga, and it was for the whole year. That game Spotify played where it raced your artists against each other? Gaga won the entire time.\n\nMy other top artists were Beyoncé, Lorde, Laufey, and Lucy Dacus. All great artists, no regrets there. But certifiably un-indie.\n\nA couple of the rundowns didn't work for me. I spent a long time hunting for my \"YOUBER\" banner. I deleted and redownloaded the Uber app; I powered my phone off and on. Nothing worked — and it seems like I wasn't alone.\n\nI can guess what would be on there, though. Uber would tell me that my primary trip was coming back from Bushwick at 3 a.m.. Uber Eats would tell me that I ordered far too much late-night Chinese food.\n\nI rarely use Snapchat, so my Snap Recap had almost nothing in it.\n\nThe Dunkin' rewards recap also felt a bit empty. My \"go-tos\" were iced coffee and donuts. At Dunkin'? Shocking. At least it didn't tell me how much I could've saved by making coffee at home. That would be devastating.\n\nI'm not a big Partiful user, though I did make my first invite this year to plan a housewarming. I co-created the invite with my roommate. For that honor, the app called me \"codependent.\" Rude!\n\nAnd the worst of them, of course, was Strava. I hate distance running. I will not be one of the gaggles of Gen Zers signing up for a marathon.\n\nI logged one — count them, one — run on Strava this year. There weren't even enough to get a \"Year in Sport.\"",

    "description": "A top US commander called the launch a \"significant milestone\" in delivering cheap drones to American forces.",
    "fullText": "A US Navy warship operating in the Middle East launched a one-way attack drone at sea this week, marking a first for the American military as it pushes to deploy this new technology.\n\nThe Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Santa Barbara launched the drone, a Low-cost Unmanned Combat Attack System, or LUCAS, in the Arabian Gulf on Tuesday, 5th Fleet said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nVice Adm. Curt Renshaw, the head of US Naval Forces Central Command, said the \"first successful launch of LUCAS from a naval vessel marks a significant milestone in rapidly delivering affordable and effective\" drones to American military personnel.\n\nThe drone launched from the Santa Barbara belonged to a new squadron based in the Middle East that operates the LUCAS systems, one-way attack drones that resemble the Iranian-designed Shahed-136 widely used by Russia in attacks against Ukraine.\n\nLUCAS, developed by the American engineering firm SpektreWorks, has an \"extensive\" range, can be launched by catapults and from vehicles and mobile ground stations, and has rocket-assisted takeoff capabilities.\n\n\"Bravo Zulu. U.S. Navy forces in the Middle East are advancing warfighting capability in new ways, bringing more striking power from the sea and setting conditions for using innovation as a deterrent.\" - Adm. Brad Cooper, CENTCOM Commander https://t.co/TgQ4WLbph3 pic.twitter.com/WUiAVojTht\n\nThe system's classification as a one-way attack drone, also known as a loitering munition, indicates that LUCAS can remain airborne in a target area for a period before diving down at its target and detonating.\n\n\"This platform will undoubtedly enhance regional maritime security and deterrence,\" said Renshaw, who oversees the American naval presence in the Middle East.\n\nLittoral combat ships, such as the Santa Barbara, are equipped with naval cannons, machine guns, and missiles. The ability to launch attack drones from the flight deck would give the vessels more firepower, though it's unclear whether the LUCAS systems would be used this way during combat operations.\n\nThe launch this week, which took place in waters near Iran, comes as the US seeks to rapidly produce and deploy inexpensive drones amid a rise in robotic and autonomous systems in modern warfare.\n\nThe Trump administration has made it a priority to boost the production of drones to keep pace with Russia and China. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared a plan envisioning a substantial $1 billion investment over two years to make and field hundreds of thousands of cheap attack drones.\n\nUS Central Command, which oversees US operations in the Middle East, announced on December 3 the establishment of a new task force for the military's first one-way attack drone squadron — using LUCAS drones — in the region.\n\nThe delta-wing shape is a popular design for one-way attack drones. Some models, like the LUCAS or Russia's Geran-2, appear to have derived their profiles from the notorious Iranian Shahed.\n\nRussia used Iranian-made Shaheds against Ukraine early in the war, but it has since started manufacturing its own versions. The Gerans carry small warheads and travel much slower than cruise and ballistic missiles, but they are significantly cheaper, allowing Moscow to launch dozens or hundreds in a single night. These weapons augment strike packages and make defense more difficult.\n\nIn May, President Donald Trump praised the Shahed for its low cost — estimated to be roughly $35,000 to $40,000 — and speed. He said the drone has proven extremely deadly in Ukraine.\n\nOne-way attack drones, like the Shahed, have been used in recent years by Iran-backed militants, who have launched them at American forces in the Middle East, as well as Israel and ships sailing off the coast of Yemen.",

    "description": "We're really into minimalism, so we started furniture-free living four years ago. I've noticed health benefits, like better balance and strength.",
    "fullText": "My wife and I live in a pretty garden apartment that's almost entirely devoid of furniture. The closest things we have are a bamboo laptop table and two single camping mattresses.\n\nAt our ages — 57 and 60 — we're expected to invest in matching La-Z-Boys and TV trays, but we spend most of our time on the floor on yoga mats. Honestly, we've never been happier.\n\nIf you'd told me this was what the future held for us back when we were lounging on our L-shaped couch in 2020, I'd have suggested you reduce the strength of your edibles. As much as we still dream about that comfortable couch, though, we wouldn't take it back.\n\nLife without furniture comes with an array of benefits, both expected and unexpected, and they're not worth trading for modern-day creature comforts.\n\nEver since inadvertently becoming minimalists in 2008, we've made a point of engaging in lifestyle experiments, but it had never occurred to us to eschew furniture.\n\nThen, I listened to a podcast about furniture-free living. I was immediately intrigued, but my wife wasn't as easily convinced.\n\nThe idea wasn't one we could entertain anyway, since we were about to move to a fully-furnished cottage in the middle of nowhere. Life has a way of giving you what you need, though, and the country wasn't for us.\n\nFive months later, we were back in Cape Town's city bowl, on the hunt for new digs.\n\nWhen a stunning, affordable, and unfurnished apartment showed up in my inbox, I took it as a sign that it was time to give furniture-free living a try.\n\nThe lush, bee-friendly garden with a towering pine tree won my wife over immediately. I didn't even have to say a word; I suspect she'd have agreed even if it meant sleeping outside in a tent.\n\nWe made some mistakes at first. Initially, we bought a cheap, low-level futon to sleep on, but it proved a poor choice for our backs, and we soon ditched it in favor of our camping mattresses.\n\nOur intention was always to buy a tatami sleeping mat down the line, but our frugal \"if it ain't broke\" selves keep deferring the purchase.\n\nRight from the get-go, we both loved hanging out on the floor, and it just felt right.\n\nWithin about a month, we began to feel physically stronger — probably because we were constantly getting up and down from floor level and forced to work on our posture.\n\nWithout a cushy office chair to sink into for hours at a stretch, we're naturally reminded to change position or get up and move.\n\nPlus, our balance has improved because we've trained ourselves to get up and sit down without the help of our hands. We can also sit unsupported for extended periods.\n\nPractically, no furniture makes moving homes — something we've done more than once in the past few years — a breeze. It makes sense for us to live in a way that supports our perpetual desire for change.\n\nWith nothing to move, housework is also ridiculously easy. Plus, our apartment always looks neat.\n\nProbably the best benefit, though, is that our quirky rescue kitty seems to love our furniture-free life. He prefers to tunnel under our legs rather than sit on our laps — and being on the floor gives him a lot of chances to do this.\n\nWhen we tell people about our lifestyle, the same concern always comes up: How do you entertain? The truth is, we don't.\n\nThis way of life isn't for everyone, and the last thing we'd want is to make our guests feel uncomfortable. So, we've found middle ground by meeting for walks or going out for coffee or a meal. It might not work for everyone, but it works for us.\n\nIronically, our next lifestyle experiment — which we're tentatively planning for late 2026 — means going back to a bed and couch, but only because you can't do without either when you live in a van.\n\nWell, technically you could … but even we're not up for that level of discomfort.",

    "description": "Every year, my husband and I spend a lot to make Christmas special, often putting us into debt until March. This year, we can finally cut back.",
    "fullText": "It's the first year my kids know Santa isn't real, so I've never been more excited about Christmas.\n\nI was told \"the news\" by my youngest kid, who cornered me in the kitchen mid-October. She said, \"Mom. We know about Santa. You don't have to pretend anymore.\"\n\nWhen I tried to argue about believing in the spirit of Christmas, I was shushed. For the first time, I didn't try to push that Santa was real. I just nodded my head. I then noticed a wave of excitement and relief wash over me.\n\nThat's when I knew I could cut back this year for the first time.\n\nSince my kids were babies, I've tried to make Christmas magical. There have been Christmas outings to see lights, cookie-making, Nutcracker trips, and \"Frozen on Ice.\" If it was holiday-themed, we did it.\n\nChristmas Day would begin with a sea of presents on the living room floor. It was like Christmas consumerism gone bananas.\n\nMy husband and I did a lot to make this magic happen, finishing the season exhausted — only to slide into the new year with mountains of debt that lasted until March.\n\nOver the last three years, my school-aged kids have been suspicious that Santa isn't real. They would try to sneak and find gifts, opening closets and investigating the garage.\n\nOn Christmas Day, they would yell out when the \"Santa\" wrapping paper was different, looking closely to scrutinize the handwriting on gift tags. They were trying to catch us in the act.\n\nI have always loved Christmas, but the holiday started to feel more like a trap and a lot less fun. I couldn't hide it, and I suppose my kids could feel this, lovingly referring to me as the Grinch. Compared to the moms on Instagram who made cookies from scratch and sewed their own stockings, my Scrooge-ness made me feel like a mom failure.\n\nNow that Santa has been unveiled, I find myself looking forward to Christmas more than I have in years. I'm hoping we can scale back this holiday season by setting some guardrails on their Christmas lists and our spending, taking a more practical approach.\n\nWe've shared with our kids what a Christmas budget can look like: things they want, need, and big asks.\n\nWhile having honest budgeting conversations during the holiday season may not seem spirit-filled, our kids are learning that making smart budgeting choices is important all year long.\n\nOf course, we'll still surprise them with a few fun items, Santa-style, but being clear about our budget helps our kids with their own financial literacy.\n\nSince Santa is no longer a secret, we hope this helps our family discover what brings true joy and how to be intentional throughout the holidays. In being honest about our budgets and reining in spending, we understand that one person can't make holiday magic; it's something we create together.\n\nWe plan to make better holiday decisions, focusing on spending more time together and, most importantly, giving more than we receive.\n\nChristmas has always been a special time for our family. Even though our kids are older, I'm hopeful that we can still experience holiday magic, but with a greater emphasis on meaning. I am excited to create new traditions and memories in the spirit of the season — without any help from Santa.",

    "description": "From sweet potato gnocchi to penne arrabbiata, I tried all the frozen pasta I could find from Trader Joe's to see which would be worth buying again.",
    "fullText": "I'm certainly no stranger to a Trader Joe's frozen meal on days when I can't be bothered to prepare anything from scratch.\n\nSo recently, I visited my local Trader Joe's and bought every frozen pasta I could find, to see which are actually worth keeping in my weekly rotation.\n\nHere's what I thought of the options I tried.\n\nLet's start with the positive — this sweet potato gnocchi came in a pleasant butter and sage sauce, which was herby and had a great flavor.\n\nAlthough the sauce was good, the gnocchi was very mushy and didn't really have any chew or bite to it. The lack of texture is truly why it was my least favorite of the bunch.\n\nThe sweet potato had a good flavor, but the gummy texture of the gnocchi was enough to stop me from buying it again.\n\nI've never tried frozen ravioli from Trader Joe's before, but I thought the ricotta-and-spinach-filled version looked tasty. Once it was cooked, however, I wasn't as impressed.\n\nThe spinach ravioli came in a rather bland tomato sauce that left me disappointed.\n\nThe ricotta-and-spinach filling had potential, but the ravioli tasted super dry. I also wish the tomato sauce had a thicker consistency.\n\nI picked up Trader Joe's spaghetti with meat sauce in hopes that it would be a simple, hearty meal. The instructions said to microwave the dish for about six minutes, so that's what I did.\n\nI was really excited when I saw Trader Joe's had an eggplant and cheese pasta, since I'm a huge fan of the vegetable.\n\nAlthough I could've cooked this in the microwave, I decided to bake it instead.\n\nWhen I took the pasta out of the oven, I didn't think it looked particularly appetizing. And once I tasted it, every bite felt uneven. Some pieces of eggplant were mushy, while others had more of a bite.\n\nThe pasta tasted a bit overcooked, too, even though I cooked it according to the directions on the package. Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this again.\n\nI'm usually a fan of spicy arrabbiata sauces, so I was excited to try this version from Trader Joe's.\n\nThe penne held its shape after cooking, and I thought the portion was generous.\n\nTrader Joe's spaghetti carbonara is made with uncured pancetta and two different kinds of cheese.\n\nOverall, this was a decent plate of spaghetti, and the pasta itself held up nicely.\n\nHowever, the sauce didn't feel like carbonara to me. It was fine, but not super flavorful. It also didn't seem as eggy as other versions I've tried.\n\nI also thought the meat was strange — in my opinion, it tasted more like the pork you'd get in Chinese food than pancetta. Overall, I wouldn't buy this again.\n\nI was drawn to this dish because I thought the fiocchetti shape looked appealing. However, once I took a bite, I felt like something was missing in terms of the flavor.\n\nUnfortunately, the cheese filling in the fiocchetti seemed a bit dry. I also thought the thin pink sauce would've benefited from some herbs or acidity.\n\nOverall, the flavor felt a bit flat, like it could've used some red pepper flakes, Parmesan cheese, or basil. The sauce was also pretty thin, which I didn't love.\n\nI was excited to try Trader Joe's garlicky pasta, which was advertised as coming in a \"creamy, umami, garlic sauce.\"\n\nIf you love garlic, you'll likely consider this meal a crown jewel of the Trader Joe's pasta selection. The glossy sauce was packed with garlic flavor and coated the pasta perfectly.\n\nIt was a little oily, but the unique umami flavor was very prominent and made me want to keep coming back for more. This has definitely earned a permanent spot in my freezer.\n\nTrader Joe's rigatoni alla contadina comes packed with vegetables like asparagus, broccoli, and peas. It's also topped with a creamy sauce.\n\nFor a veggie-loaded frozen pasta, I thought this was pretty good. The creamy sauce was mild, but it did a good job of tying everything together.\n\nThe rigatoni was cooked well, and the green vegetables added a nice texture, pop of color, and bite. A squeeze of lemon, Parmesan, or black pepper could take it even further, but as is, it's a good meal.\n\nI'll be honest, I didn't have high hopes for a frozen risotto. However, once prepared, I was shocked by how creamy and delicious it looked.\n\nI thought the mushroom flavor came through nicely, even though the pieces were fairly small. The meal was a little on the salty side, but I didn't think that was a bad thing.\n\nI really liked how it wasn't too thick or heavy but still rich enough to feel indulgent. With the addition of a chicken cutlet, I could easily pass this off as a nice date-night meal.\n\nI was excited to try Trader Joe's take on cacio e pepe — a pasta dish made with a creamy cheese and black-pepper sauce.\n\nThis meal is a freezer MVP. The sauce was creamy, cheesy, and peppery, and the spaghetti had a satisfying chew.\n\nIt was very heavy, but in the comforting way you actually want from pasta.\n\nOne thing to note is that the sauce thickened significantly when it cooled. So, it's best enjoyed hot.\n\nWith a little added Parmesan and grilled chicken, this would make a complete and satisfying meal.",

    "description": "Kristin Cabot said the video has been a \"scarlet letter\" and made her \"unemployable.\" Read some of the biggest takeaways from her first interviews.",
    "fullText": "This summer, seemingly the entire internet was talking about Kristin Cabot. She's finally talking back.\n\nWhen a Coldplay concert \"kiss cam\" caught Cabot, Astronomer's former head of people, and Andy Byron, the company's former CEO, embracing, the footage quickly went viral. In the weeks that followed, both Cabot and Byron left their jobs.\n\nNow, Cabot, who was in the process of separating from her now-ex husband at the time of the infamous concert, has given her first public interviews to The New York Times and the Times of London.\n\nFrom the crisis management to anger at Gwyneth Paltrow to lasting career fallout, here are the biggest takeaways from Cabot's conversations.\n\nCabot told both outlets that she and Byron had never kissed before the concert. She said they'd gotten along well since she joined Astronomer in November of 2024, and that she'd told him about her ongoing separation from Andrew Cabot shortly before the concert in July. That's when she said she learned that he, too, was going through a similar situation. (Andrew Cabot has publicly acknowledged that the couple was separated at the time and the two have since filed for divorce; the status of Byron's marriage is unclear, according to the Times of London).\n\nImmediately after the big screen caught Cabot and Byron embracing — and quickly untangling, ducking, and turning away — Cabot said she first thought of accidentally humiliating her still-husband, who was also at the concert.\n\n\"Then a beat later my mind turns to, 'Oh God, Andy's my effing boss', this is a bad look,'\" Cabot told the Times of London.\n\nThe two employees quickly went into crisis management mode, driving to her home about an hour away and deciding they needed to tell the board before anything got out, Cabot told both outlets. She said that \"panic attacks were starting,\" according to the New York Times. She and Byron continued strategizing on the phone for several hours after he left, she told the Times of London.\n\nCabot has since hired a communications consultant and told The New York Times she and Byron haven't spoken much since September.\n\nAround 4 am, Andrew Cabot sent her a screenshot of the video on TikTok, Cabot told the London outlet. She said he was cordial throughout the whole ordeal.\n\nThe next morning, she said she apologized to the board, whom she said was kind, even as they opened an investigation. Eventually, the board asked Cabot to stay in her role, she told both outlets. Ultimately, she decided to leave.\n\nThe weekend after the video went viral, Cabot said she retreated to an Airbnb in the New Hampshire mountains. She told the Times of London that she was in \"too dark a place\" to fulfill her responsibilities as a parent.\n\nCabot told the New York Times that she got between 500 and 600 calls each day in the weeks after the concert, and 50 or 60 death threats. She said her children hesitated to go out with her in public, as people — largely women — would heckle her. She told the outlet that local police increased surveillance of her home and that she installed security cameras.\n\nFormer colleagues have cut her off altogether, she said.\n\nIn July, Paltrow, the founder and CEO of Goop, appeared in an Astronomer ad that poked fun at the kiss cam video. Cabot told the Times of London that Paltrow, who popularized the phrase \"conscious uncoupling\" when she split from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, was acting like a \"hypocrite.\" She decided to throw out all of her Goop products.\n\nCabot also told the outlet that she believed Martin played a role in creating the scandal and was disappointed that nobody from Coldplay had ever contacted her or released a statement.\n\nCabot said she has long prided herself on her career and her financial independence, and told the Times of London that the whole scandal has made her virtually \"unemployable.\"\n\n\"It has been like a scarlet letter; people erased everything I'd accomplished in my life and achieved in my career,\" she said.",

    "description": "Blackstone's holiday video has become a cringe-inducing tradition on Wall Street for eight years. Here are the ones worth watching.",
    "fullText": "Blackstone released its 2025 holiday video on Thursday — the latest installment in a tradition that began in 2018 as a way to liven up employees' spirits in lieu of the holiday party, which was canceled because the firm had grown too large.\n\nSince then, the video has become a viral sensation. Eight million people viewed 2023's video showing Blackstone's executives fumbling in their efforts to be more like Taylor Swift — the same year the Daily Mail wondered whether it might be \"the most cringeworthy corporate video ever.\"\n\nWatching — and poking fun at — the video is now a Wall Street tradition, making Jay Gillespie, Blackstone's head of video, a hot commodity at 345 Park Avenue.\n\n\"People come up to me throughout the year, and they're like, 'My daughter is helping me rehearse so I might get a line next year,'\" Gillespie told Business Insider in 2024. \"People are really into lobbying to be in it.\"\n\nIf you don't get it, don't worry. We decided to help readers save time by watching and reviewing all of the firm's videos going back to 2018.\n\nThis video was released in December 2020, during the peak of the pandemic. It stuck to the theme it launched in 2018 of depicting Blackstone as a version of the NBC sitcom \"The Office,\" but executives wore face masks and pandemic jokes featured prominently. In an early scene, one Blackstone executive struggles to recognize a colleague with unmanageably long hair. (Remember when all the barber shops were closed?)\n\nWhile it was a bleak time, the video ends on an upbeat note, with Blackstone employees cutting loose to \"I'm Walking on Sunshine,\" kicking off a tradition of holiday video songs that has featured prominently since. Still, it's somewhat stuck in the pandemic era, hence its placement at No. 7.\n\nThe conceit of this holiday season is a fake news station, \"BX TV News,\" prompting Jon Gray to search for Blackstone's secret sauce. (It was a roundabout way for the firm to tout its plan to hit $1 trillion assets under management, which it has since achieved.)\n\nSchwarzman returns to a role he often plays in these videos, that of the sincere elder statesman, to explain that the firm's true secret sauce is its employees. However, he notes that a secret is hidden in the basement, setting two executives on an Indiana Jones-style quest to find the scroll containing the firm's secret. This weird twist is the highlight of the video.\n\nThe video effectively makes several self-deprecating jokes about Blackstone's love of acronyms (BCRED, anyone?) and Wall Street's notorious work hours. By 2022, however, the company had been going with \"The Office\" theme for four years, hence its ranking.\n\nThe budget for the holiday video clearly increased this year, with a storyline about the birth of BX TV, the firm's weekly video call that Gray is incredibly enthusiastic about (and employees, less so). There are animals, special effects, and a Reese Witherspoon cameo.\n\nThe key joke is a fake award ceremony where Gray receives \"Best Weekly Internal Zoom Call at an Alternative Asset Management firm.\" The hope is that it will convince the firm's president and chief operating officer that it's time to move on with John Finley, chief legal officer, saying, \"I make one call to the FCC, and they'll cancel this clown car.\"\n\nEmployees chant \"end it\" and celebrate, thinking Gray has decided to cancel the show after winning the award. It quickly becomes clear that the 2022 BX TV season is already being planned, and the internal video call remains a weekly requirement at the firm.\n\nScranton, Pennsylvania, is a long way from Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, and Dunder Mifflin would be among its smallest portfolio companies, yet Blackstone successfully riffed off the NBC sitcom \"The Office\" for its first annual holiday video. The video begins with the theme music from the television show, and like \"The Office,\" there is hand-held camera work and plenty of \"candid\" interviews with executives. There's also a Michael Scott look-alike. As with all the holiday videos that follow, this one starts with Jon Gray calling his executive assistant, Laurie Carlson.\n\nThis video started it all and set the tone for Blackstone's trademark style of mixing the firm's reality with jokes. The premise of the video is that Blackstone canceled its holiday party and replaced it with a video, which actually happened. And Jon Gray really does, sometimes, act a bit like Michael Scott in his enthusiasm for wild ideas, according to people who know him. There are fewer visual gags and no Hollywood cameos, but it's a classic.\n\n2023's holiday video marked the first time Blackstone moved away from being a parallel version of \"The Office\" (only the title card remains). Instead, it's an homage to Taylor Swift and the Eras tour, with Blackstone trying to replicate her success with its own song about alternative investments.\n\nThis is the video that broke into the wider world, spawning mocking tabloid headlines. But for a video series whose main goal is to help the firm laugh at itself, that's a measure of success. Add that this immortal line: \"Just this once, I do hope people confuse us with BlackRock.\" Also, you get to see Steve Schwarzman dancing while wearing a glittery fringe top.\n\nThis year, Blackstone turned 40 years old, so it was only right that the firm lived out its midlife crisis in front of all of us. The birthday celebration begins with a Ken Burns documentary about the firm's origins, before Jon Gray asks for Burns to be fired in favor of some \"pizzaz.\"\n\nBlackstone's execs are all dealing with their age in different ways: wearing nose rings and buying sports teams or Ferrari (the company). Steve Schwarzman's ambition to become a DJ leads to a cameo by actual DJ and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\nAnother cameo from Jersey Mike's spokesperson Danny DeVito is a highlight, with his contract apparently requiring him to take on the challenging job of advertising \"non-listed, semi-liquid, institutional-quality perpetual products.\"\n\nThe video ends with a musical number, this time an age-appropriate 80s theme, alongside a dizzying array of 80s references and an executive pulling off the iconic Dirty Dancing lift. After a challenging year for the firm's employees, this year the firm leaned into embarrassing itself and having fun.\n\nThe 2019 holiday video revolves around Blackstone's absurd search for a company mascot, which turns out to be Mr. Stone, a mascot that looks like a cross of Hulk and Jon Gray. The international offices of Blackstone get cameos in this one, as does a plug for Steve Schwarzman's book, \"What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence.\"\n\nGray told BI that this was his favorite in the series because of the mascot. The firm not only hired a company to build the mascot suit, but also made dozens of bobbleheads, which still show up in holiday videos and on some people's desks. We agree that the mascot joke is a highlight.\n\nThis video also ends with one of the best Steve Schwarzman gags of the series, when it's revealed that Schwarzman has been the mysterious person inside Mr. Stone the whole time.\n\nIn 2024, the firm leaned into the cringe with a metaverse-like exploration of Blackstone executives as reality television stars, culminating in a country song-and-dance routine.\n\nIt features appearances from famous friends. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, which was originally part of Blackstone before spinning out in the 1990s, makes a joke about how the two firms are often confused for each other.\n\nGray last year told Business Insider that the turn to country was inspired by Beyonce's own embrace of the genre on \"Cowboy Carter.\"And just like Beyonce, some of the firm's best work comes when they don't let the critics stop them.\n\nJeffrey Cane contributed to previous year's rankings.",

We are grieving with you. Our nation is grieving with you.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Melania Trump watched Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.\n\nDonald Trump, who received both cheers and boos at the game, called it \"a great match.\"\n\nMelania Trump watched the game from behind her bright-white Dior sunglasses, which resembled the Vuarnet glasses worn by Sam Altman at Sun Valley just days earlier.

    "fullText": "YouTuber MrBeast loves giving away piles of cash. Now he wants to teach his millions of viewers how to spend it responsibly.\n\nThe world's top YouTube creator, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, said he wants to make videos \"educating people on investing and showing them what is a Roth IRA.\" The content would probably live on a separate YouTube channel, Donaldson said, speaking to creator Jon Youshaei in an interview posted Monday.\n\nThe move into personal finance content may seem out of left field for a YouTuber who amassed hundreds of millions of subscribers by posting stunt videos like burying himself alive. However, money is a common theme in MrBeast videos, whether Donaldson is asking 100 identical twins to battle it out for $250,000 or locking contestants in a bunker for 100 days to potentially win a $500,000 cash prize.\n\nFinancial content \"just feels like a nice fit for us because we do so much with money,\" Donaldson said during the conversation.\n\nMrBeast gave away $10 million to the winner of the first season of his Amazon Prime Video competition show, \"Beast Games.\" Cash giveaways were so prevalent in that series that my colleague Katie Notopoulous felt obliged to explain to her elementary-aged son that money in the real world isn't just an \"object to build into pyramids or toss around in bags.\"\n\nLaunching a YouTube channel focused on expanding financial literacy could also serve as a marketing vehicle for one of Donaldson's next ventures: MrBeast Financial.\n\nThe CEO of the YouTuber's company confirmed earlier this month that the team plans to launch a financial services product as one of its next business lines.\n\nWhile the MrBeast team has been quiet on specifics, an investor deck from earlier this year, viewed by Business Insider, listed a variety of potential services for the business, including student loans and insurance. The company would likely work with a fintech partner rather than building the business from scratch, per the investor materials.\n\nA spokesperson for MrBeast declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "I grew up on Maui and have spent much of my adult life living in and exploring Hawaii's many islands.\n\nHowever, I'd never visited Molokai — one of three populated islands in Maui County — until recently.\n\nOften described as Hawaii's \"least touristy\" island, Molokai hosted around 30,000 visitors in 2024, a minuscule percentage of the millions of tourists who came to our state.\n\nHome to about 7,400 residents, much of the island's land remains dedicated to agriculture, cultural preservation, and rural areas.\n\nThe island has no big-box resorts, not much nightlife, no permanent traffic lights, and limited visitor infrastructure. The tight-knit community has historically resisted large-scale tourism to protect its slower pace of life.\n\nUntil 2016, travelers could reach Molokai by ferry from my hometown of Lahaina, but the service was discontinued due to competition from commuter air travel and declining ridership, Maui News reported.\n\nToday, small commuter planes are the only way to access the island.\n\nI paid $190 for my round-trip ticket from Maui, and the turbulent 20-minute flight quickly made it clear to me why this trip isn't for everyone.\n\nHaving traveled on Mokulele Airlines, a Hawaiian airline popular with commuters and island hoppers, before, I knew what to expect.\n\nCheck-in is usually quick, there's no security checkpoint, and passengers receive their seat assignments before walking out to the plane as a group.\n\nI knew 15 minutes would be more than enough time, even if I just checked in and went straight to the plane.\n\nAll baggage must be weighed upon check-in.\n\nI had provided my weight ahead of time, but I was also asked to step on the scale with my carry-on items for the most accurate measurement.\n\nFrom there, seating assignments are based on the safest way to distribute everyone's weight.\n\nI ended up on the same flight as a childhood friend. She was traveling to see her parents, who had moved to the island after their retirement.\n\nShe told me she loves visiting Molokai and unplugging by putting her phone on airplane mode for the duration of her trip — not that reception is always easy to come by on the island anyway.\n\nThe day before my flight, I received an email notifying me that my 9:50 a.m. departure had been moved to 10:55 a.m.\n\nI wasn't given a reason for the change, so I wondered if it was due to inclement weather (as noted on a flyer at the check-in counter) or simply the consolidation of flights to ensure there were enough people (namely, weight) on the plane.\n\nMy group boarded the plane together a little after 11 a.m.\n\nSeeing palm trees and the West Maui Mountains through the plane windows made for a scenic departure and set the tone for the natural beauty I'd soon experience on Molokai.\n\nShortly after takeoff, the coastline came into full view and revealed several beaches below, including Paia's expansive Baldwin Beach.\n\nHome to the island's only other commuter terminal, I would have flown out of Kapalua Airport if I still lived on the West Side.\n\nAs the plane found its course, my view became obscured, and I could only see Maui's mountainous landscape, with Lanai off in the distance, through the window across the aisle.\n\nFor a moment, I wondered if I should've sat on the left side for better views.\n\nI'd been so engrossed by the scenery on the opposite side that I didn't notice how quickly Molokai appeared outside my own window.\n\nOn this flight, I saw the most beautiful Hawaiian waters I've ever seen, and the land reminded me of the landscapes on my home island.\n\nAfter all, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Kahoolawe once formed a single landmass called Maui Nui before rising sea levels and erosion separated them.\n\nMolokai is home to one of the longest fringing reefs in the US, which spans about 30 miles.\n\nTurquoise reef flats and darker blue channels created a distinct, patchwork appearance.\n\nWe also flew over several ancient Hawaiian fishponds that sit along the island's south shore — including Ualapue Fishpond, a national historic landmark recognized for its well-preserved traditional engineering.\n\nAgriculture is a major industry on Molokai — even the high school's mascot is the Farmers — and the island's lands are primarily used for cattle grazing and for growing crops like coffee, fruits, and vegetables.\n\nSmaller aircraft are more susceptible to wind, which can make for a noticeably bumpier ride.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this trip for nervous flyers because the turbulence got surprisingly intense, especially in the last few minutes of the flight.\n\nThe tiny terminal and ironwood trees lining the property reminded me of Kapalua, and the familiar landscape made me feel like I'd never actually left Maui.\n\nIt was literally an elongated bench — something you might mistake for regular seating if not for the \"Baggage Claim\" sign hanging above it.\n\nThe Molokai Airport has only two runways and occupies a small area of a few hundred acres.\n\nWalking through it, I spotted a display by the Molokai Arts Center and Molokai History Project; an uncrewed activity counter by Molokai Outdoors; Aunty's Leis & Little Things gift shop; and a small wall of brochures, including an excellent one from the Hawaii Tourism Authority about visiting this precious island.\n\nThe journey is best for those who can handle turbulence — children and nervous flyers may find the ride challenging.\n\nThough the planes are ADA accessible, seat assignments are based on weight distribution rather than proximity to the door, which may be challenging for travelers with mobility concerns.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, though, Molokai is generally not a popular stop for tourists anyway.\n\nIts limited offerings in terms of nightlife, resort amenities, and high-end dining seem to reflect the long-standing preference for preserving Old Hawaii's slower, community-centered way of life.\n\nThis island feels meant for those looking to unplug — whether by choice or because of the spotty reception — slow down, connect with nature, and embrace solitude.\n\nStill, I was excited to explore the island and get a taste of it myself … but more on that later.",

    "fullText": "I was on my knees in my November garden at 72, jeans soaked, wrestling bishopweed from the cold earth. Some things just keep coming back — bishopweed, old hurts, family patterns, and the stories we tell ourselves about how life was supposed to go.\n\nI glanced at the bag of bulbs — tulips, crocuses, daffodils that I should have planted last month. I'm late, as usual. Best-laid plans. Four generations of my family have lived through divorce: my parents, mine, my son's, and now my grandchildren's experience of its aftermath. It's not the story any of us planned, but it's the one we live with tenderness and humor — mostly.\n\nI am the matriarch of this sprawling, untidy bunch — nephews, nieces, their children, in-laws, exes, half-siblings, and step-grandparents. I once believed I could keep everyone together, as if some ancient Sicilian bargain required it: family stays together, no matter what. No matter the divisions — divorce, hurt feelings, politics, betrayal, religion.\n\nNow, as the holidays approach, I'm trying to map out what they'll look like this year. Is my first husband's wife hosting? Or my ex-daughter-in-law? Who's on the email chain, and who's on the text thread? Which day? Who might not come at all? Making sure no one — accidentally or on purpose — gets left out.\n\nWhen I was a child in the 1950s, the entire extended family gathered around a long holiday table that stretched from the dining room into the living room. We dragged in folding tables, scavenged mismatched chairs from the basement, and Uncle Tony had to shout from one end to talk to Aunt Lee at the other. My mother sighed in the kitchen, wondering aloud why she always had to host this huge gathering. I lifted the heavy velvet-lined box to take out the fancy silverware while my father raked leaves in the yard, chatting with neighbors over the fence. Divorce was rare.\n\nNow, the picture looks very different. Our family tables have multiplied. During the holidays, we juggle multiple households, competing plans, and shifting versions of \"together.\" I've learned to hold my expectations loosely. It's not the Norman Rockwell version, but it's ours. Love looks different when every branch of the family tree is healing in its own messy, imperfect way. And though the coordination sometimes makes my head spin, I'm quite pleased that everyone still wants to gather — in some form, at some table, somewhere.\n\nWhen everything gets too tangled, with the group texts, the expectations, and the quiet grief, I go outside. The garden never demands RSVP lists or follow-up emails. It asks only that I show up, hands in the dirt, and remember that what's alive doesn't always look orderly.\n\nI want traditions and people to stay the same — or at least familiar. As a child, I believed that if I could just figure out the right way to do things, I could have love that was always peaceful and adventures that weren't risky. I didn't know how ironic — how oxymoronic, really — that was. Even as I aged, I believed that once I got old, life would finally be easy and that all the negative feelings would be behind me. Denial is powerful.\n\nMaybe it's the therapist in me that still wants to make sense out of every rupture and eliminate the chaos. But healing isn't tidy, and most families can do is clean up after the storm and rake up the leaves.\n\nGrief takes up a lot of room at the table. I want to wrap a warm blanket of comfort around the whole family. I want to change all negative feelings into safety and coziness, and have everyone be OK. But the only way I've ever reached \"it's OK\" is by admitting when it isn't, and by asking for help when I need it, and by letting the people who love me see that I'm not always fine. No matter who's coming where or who might not come at all, my challenge now is to stand beside my family rather than try to manage or fix them — to let go without withdrawing.\n\nMy grandchildren are watching all of us, trying to figure out how love works after endings. Sometimes, I think they handle emotional complexity with more grace than we adults do. Still, I worry. Is that grace — or just what powerlessness looks like when you're young? What will they remember?\n\nWhat I do know is that they continue to love. Their instinct to connect shows me that love doesn't depend on tidiness. It depends on presence, on trusting that it can stretch. They make room for everyone without overthinking it. Maybe that's what they've learned growing up in families like ours: by not expecting perfection, they're free to keep loving.\n\nWhat surprises me most isn't the breaking — it's that we keep trying. The family I have now is wide and imperfect, with exes who sometimes bring pies to dinner, step-grandparents who've reached inclusion, holidays that span multiple homes and don't always hold everyone.\n\nI look at my garden, knowing the bishopweed will return no matter how deep I dig. The roses never bloom exactly when I expect them to. The bulbs I planted late will still find their way up through the cold ground come spring. There's something comforting in that — a reminder that life, and love, don't follow our timelines.\n\nVirginia DeLuca is a therapist and the author of \"If You Must Go, I Wish You Triplets.\" She writes about family, aging, and the ways love changes shape over time.",

    "description": "Tracy Gunn earned more than her husband, until they had kids. She realized her career would never catch up if she continued running their household full-time.",
    "fullText": "This essay is based on a conversation with Tracy Gunn, 50, who is based in Dublin. In 2021, she cofounded Platform55, which helps businesses create more equal and diverse environments. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore my husband and I had children, I earned more than him.\n\nI had a senior role at a well-known brand and then, 20 years ago, started a leadership development consultancy. When we had children, I decided to work fewer hours to take care of our boys, who are now 14 and 12.\n\nAs I was self-employed and could therefore be more flexible with my work hours, I took charge of everything at home, including getting the boys ready for school, picking them up, and cooking dinner. As they got older, I chauffeured them to their evening sports activities, which also required washing and drying their uniforms in time.\n\nMy husband, meanwhile, took care of things like our finances and maintaining our house and car, for instance by getting the boiler serviced or the car winter-ready.\n\nHe was a great partner and dad who was doing a lot. But many of the things he did weren't time sensitive, and could either be done at any time or maybe once a week or quarter. However, a lot of the tasks required to run a house need to be done every day.\n\nHe started earning more than me quite soon after I scaled back at work to look after our kids, as I went down to working three days a week, term-time only.\n\nIt was a choice I made, and I was happy to do it. My earnings taking a significant hit made me subconsciously feel like I should spend more time running our home and looking after the boys day-to-day, so he could focus on his role as the head of information security at an insurance company.\n\nWe both fell into our roles at home, and I don't regret choosing to step back at work to be with the kids — I'm very happy I did.\n\nBut as they got older, I felt the need to rebalance our workload; otherwise, my career and earnings would never catch up.\n\nI remember a moment in January when I was deeply engrossed in a proposal for my business when I looked at the clock and realized it was time for school pickup, to prepare dinner, and get the boys ready for their sports. My husband, meanwhile, could carry on working uninterrupted.\n\nI felt really cheesed off and told my husband: \"I would love to be you for a week, and for you to be me. I'd love us to swap roles.\" Later that night, I told him I was serious and felt I was doing a lot of the heavy lifting in the household.\n\n\"I want you to see what that's like,\" I said. He replied that he'd be happy to.\n\nWe agreed to do it in one of the two weeks he had free before starting a new job later that month. We acknowledged it wouldn't be a true swap, because he wouldn't be juggling daily household responsibilities with a full-time job like I typically do, but I was happy to take what I could get.\n\nAs I had hoped, the experiment was eye-opening. My husband said he hadn't realized how much work I did in the background.\n\nOn the first day, I went into our home office at about 8.45 a.m. When I came out at around 5 or 6 p.m., dinner was ready, and homework, laundry, and all the other stuff that just has to happen at home daily was taken care of. It gave him a different appreciation of everything that goes into running our home.\n\nI couldn't believe the mental freedom I had and what I was able to deliver. I wasn't constantly watching the clock and thinking about where I needed to be. I could focus on one thing at a time.\n\nA big part of what we do at my company, Platform55, is emphasizing the importance of both men and women \"parenting out loud\" by being vocal at work about when they have to take time out for family responsibilities.\n\nA 2025 report by McKinsey suggested that the gender pay gap partly stems from women taking time away from work and stepping down from senior roles for caregiving reasons.\n\nThe more that men parent out loud, the more we can break down stereotypes around who is the \"breadwinner\" versus \"caregiver,\" and we can work on reducing gender pay gaps.\n\nNow, every Sunday, we share our plans for the week. For instance, my husband goes into the office once a week, and I sometimes need to be on-site with clients. I also travel regularly from Ireland to Scotland to see my mother, who isn't well at the moment.\n\nWe decide who is \"on\" at home on what days and is responsible for pick-ups, drop-offs, cooking, and other household tasks, while the other person is free to concentrate on their work.\n\nOur workload is more balanced now. It's not always 50/50 every week, but I feel it evens out in the end. My husband was also able to start his job with this new balance in mind, which was helpful for setting expectations with colleagues that he will be doing school drop-offs and pick-ups on certain days.\n\nI posted about our role swap on LinkedIn and was surprised by how many people it resonated with. My post received over 22,000 impressions, 500 likes, and around 100 comments, mostly from women who strongly related to the experience. Some men commented to share how much work they feel they do at home, leading to some interesting discussions between commenters.\n\nI think sometimes men feel like they're being criticized. So, I'm working on a framework to help more people have this conversation without it turning into an argument or making it seem like someone's doing something wrong.\n\nI learned some valuable lessons during our role swap, too, including letting go of control. If my husband is doing a task, having me supervise and comment on how I would do it doesn't help. I've had to back off and let him do things his way, because when the other person feels that they're constantly being critiqued, they'll just end up thinking, \"why would I bother doing it, if you're just going to tell me I've done it the wrong way?\"\n\nI also made the important realization that I do like being involved in family life. During our role swap week, I missed being part of what the boys were doing.\n\nThat's not to say I want to go back to how we were before, but it was a good reset and helped us find the right balance for us.",

I think demand will far exceed what we can think of.\"\n\nIn the chart, OpenAI illustrated how \"more compute\" leads to \"better products,\" which in turn leads to \"more revenue.\"\n\nCompute fuels progress. pic.twitter.com/ePm7pmpb8Q\n\nBrockman and his fellow OpenAI executives have said for months that the dearth of compute available to OpenAI is holding the company back, forcing it to make tough trade-offs and delaying launches.\n\n\"When we look at our launch calendar, the single biggest blocker often becomes, 'Ok, but where's the compute going to come from for that?'\"\n\nAs an example, Brockman said that when OpenAI launched its image generator in March, it had to make \"some very painful decisions to take a bunch of compute from research\" in order to meet demand for the service.\n\nRonnie Chatterji, a top economist in the Biden administration, said countries around the world, including China, are making big investments in AI infrastructure.\n\n\"People are worried about whether people are trying to do too much,\" Chatterji said in a video OpenAI published on X. \"I just encourage people to think about and consider, what if we're not moving fast enough? What if we're investing too little?\"\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in September that the biggest risk for his company \"is probably in not being aggressive enough.\"\n\n\"If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously,\" Zuckerberg said on an episode of the \"Access\" podcast. \"But what I'd say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.\"\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who led the development of GPT-2 and 3 at OpenAI before starting his rival company, recently said that part of the difficulty is that companies have to make bets years in advance on what the demand might be. Still, Amodei offered some veiled criticism of people in the industry who are \"YOLOing,\" which was viewed as a shot at Altman.\n\n\"I have to decide now, literally now, or in some cases a few months ago, how much compute I need to buy — to serve the models in early 2027 when I get to that revenue amount,\" Amodei said during The New York Times' DealBook Summit.\n\nUnlike Meta, Google, and other hyperscalers, OpenAI doesn't have a large dedicated revenue base to fall back on if its bets don't pay off.\n\nLast month, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sparked concerns when she spoke of a \"government backstop\" for data center spending. She later walked back those remarks, and Altman said OpenAI believed \"taxpayers should not bail out companies that make bad business decisions.\"\n\n\"If we get it wrong, that's on us,\" Altman wrote on X.",

    "description": "Nasdaq wants to enable trading on the exchange for nearly 24 hours a day during the week. Finance pros are mixed on the idea.",
    "fullText": "A major shift may be coming for the stock market in 2026.\n\nNasdaq is planning to submit paperwork to the Securities & Exchange Commission seeking approval to enable around-the-clock stock trading for 23 hours a day during the week.\n\nThe move would shake up the long-standing 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session that's been in place since the 1980s, and market pros have mixed views on the prospect.\n\nWhile some market veterans believe that around-the-clock trading would ultimately be beneficial for the market, others have raised concerns that the move could lead to an uneven playing field or gamify equities in a way that makes the market resemble crypto more closely.\n\nRobinhood already has 24-hour markets for some popular stocks, and crypto markets famously trade 24/7. Some argue that the added trading hours make these assets—particularly crypto, which often sees big swings over the weekend—more volatile.\n\nHere's what the pros are saying.\n\nA selling point of Nasdaq's around-the-clock trading initiative is that it could help democratize markets and make trading more accessible, particularly to traders outside the US.\n\nJosé Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said that many people who want to trade stocks find it difficult if they work a normal 9-5 job or live outside the US. Extending the trading day would address both issues.\n\n\"It gives greater access for more participation across demographics, across applications, across geographies,\" Torres told Business Insider. \"And I think it's also good because it'll offer real-time looks and real-time reactions on things that are happening overnight.\"\n\nThe sentiment was echoed by Bob Lange, founder and chief options analyst of options trading and education platform Explosive Options. He said he sees the move as ultimately positive, as it will likely enable more people to start trading.\n\nNeither Torres nor Lange is concerned about more trading causing volatility in markets to increase. That said, Lange said he sees other potential problems developing if the Nasdaq introduces longer trading hours.\n\n\"I don't believe that the smart money is going to really participate in this, in this after-hours trading market, per se,\" he said. \"The volume is just not going to be big enough to create a very fair market for individuals.\"\n\nMichael Ashley Schulman, CIO of Running Point Capital Advisors, said that in a market with around-the-clock trading, the advantage will likely lie with those who already have vast tools and resources, specifically hedge funds and quant firms.\n\n\"The advantage tilts toward players who can monitor, model, and execute in microseconds,\" he said. \"People don't become irrelevant, but in the thinner overnight tape, the human can absolutely start lagging the machines, which means retail should expect more quirky price movements.\"\n\nLouis Navellier, chairman and CIO of Navellier & Associates, told Business Insider that while he understands why Nasdaq would want to encourage more trading, he thinks the plan carries outsize risks.\n\n\"After the normal market close at four o'clock, we run the risk of the sharks coming out, and we run the risk of short sellers and overseas markets trying to manipulate everything,\" he said.\n\nIn his view, Nasdaq is racing to introduce around-the-clock trading to keep up with its competition. Indeed, Robinhood has introduced 24-hour trading for some popular stocks, and the New York Stock Exchange already filed for a 22-hour trading day in February.\n\nNasdaq did not respond to a request for comment.",

Lee Ainslie's Maverick was up over 23% through November 21, according to HSBC's Hedge Weekly report. And Dan Sundheim's D1 has returned 28% through November in the firm's public equities book, an individual close to the manager told Business Insider.\n\nThe managers mentioned declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nFor Viking, this run of performance coincides with the firm's first calendar year without Ning Jin, the former chief investment officer of the manager.\n\nJin was with Viking for 17 years and was the sole CIO of the firm in 2019 before departing in August of last year. He launched his own firm, Avantyr Capital, earlier this quarter with $1.5 billion.\n\nViking has become somewhat of an incubator for the industry's next generation, as several former executives for the firm have gone on to start their own funds, with Sundheim being the biggest of the Viking spin-offs.\n\nThe firm's current CIO is Justin Walsh, who first joined Viking as an intern in 2010. He started full-time at the manager in 2011 and has steadily climbed the ranks since.\n\nAt a conference last summer, Walsh spoke about the market risks associated with the growth of large multistrategy hedge funds like Citadel and Millennium, as well as his favorite luxury stock, Cartier-owner Richemont. Walsh was the portfolio manager for industrials and consumer stocks before becoming CIO after Jin's departure.\n\nViking's portfolio and investment style differ somewhat from those of its tech-heavy Tiger Cub peers. The manager is known for taking a more diversified approach, with a significant focus on its short book, to hedge market risk.\n\nIn 2022, that paid off for the long-running firm: Viking was down 2.5% that year in its public equities portfolio, while funds like Coatue and Tiger Global suffered much heavier losses.\n\nBut that means the firm can miss out on big gains when the market is powered by a small subset of companies. According to regulatory filings, the manager's biggest holdings, as of the end of the third quarter, are four financial services companies: PNC, JPMorgan Chase, Charles Schwab, and Capital One.\n\nWithin Viking's top 10 holdings, only Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor would be considered a part of the AI trade that has fueled much of the overall market's gains in 2025.",

    "description": "Giti Tire, a middle-market manufacturer competing on thin margins, cut emissions across its operations and supply chain while improving profitability—achieving “net zero at net zero cost” by embedding sustainability into its core business model rather than treating it as a compliance exercise. Its results came from four practical moves: tightening energy-intensive processes, turning traceability into market access, designing products that reduce customers’ fuel use, and rethinking short-haul logistics with electric autonomy. The company’s experience shows that when sustainability is pursued as a source of performance, not a trade-off, even cost-constrained manufacturers can reduce emissions, win customers, and strengthen returns.",

    "description": "To make better use of your time, you should set some aside for a bit of reading.",
    "fullText": "Efficient time management takes, well, time to perfect. There are a variety of hacks out there to help you schedule, focus, and complete your work, but it’s still hard to actually do all of that without the right guidance and mindset. If you’re struggling with time management, it might be worth spending some time digging deep on the topic and reading what experts have to say. Here are some of the best books I recommend to help you improve your time management skills.\n\nThe 5AM Club: Own Your Morning. Elevate Your Life by Robin Sharma\n\nIf your goal is to wake up every day and kick things off with maximum productivity and overall put-together-ness, try Robin Sharma’s best-selling manifesto on embracing mornings (something I've been endeavoring to do myself for a few months). Sharma believes success starts early in the morning, so if you can harness the power of your morning routine and get up early to greet the day, you can be more focused, productive, and happy—and I've certainly found that to be true for myself, though it absolutely is rough to get used to waking up earlier. It doesn’t take much, either: You just need one hour every morning for this, meaning this goes hand-in-hand with the concept of a \"Power Hour,\" which also comes from a book you should read. Reviewers call it a “game changer” and “extremely important.”\n\nThe 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More With Less by Richard Koch\n\nYou may have heard the old adage that 80% of our success comes from 20% of our work—or the Pareto Principle, which I've written about if you need a reminder—but what do you do with that information and how do you apply it to your life? Koch’s book is all about how you can identify the 20% of your effort that truly counts for productivity, then focus in on it. This is great for people who have way too much going on. Reviewers say it can “add hours to your days” and increase your happiness.\n\nDeep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport\n\nI recommend Newport’s deep work practice pretty often around here, and for good reason: Learning the skill of focusing hard on your important tasks is key to handling your responsibilities well and getting everything done. Deep work is all about getting more efficient by eliminating distractions, so you’ll end up doing \n\nEat That Frog!: 21 Great Ways to Stop Procrastinating and Get More Done in Less Time by Brian Tracy\n\nIf you want to get a sense of the sheer amount of productivity hacks out there—and which one is best for your specific needs—try this book of 21 tips, which is in its third edition. It’s part of a series by Tracy, so you could pick up a version for students or supplemental cards to keep on hand as reminders, but the original book is a hit for a reason. Its most famous tip is, of course, that you should \"eat the frog,\" or tackle your biggest, most demanding task right away every day, but there are a handful of other solid ideas in there that can suit anyone's needs if that doesn't work for you. (Eating the frog isn't my preferred time management method, but that's why it's great there are so many options.) Reviewers call the steps “practical” and praise Tracy for being a consistently helpful read for years.\n\nThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey\n\nYou’ve heard of this book before. Maybe you heard of the version geared toward teens or saw someone else using the supplemental workbook. It’s been around more than 30 years, and it’s a classic in the productivity world. Covey recommends being proactive, beginning tasks with the end in mind, prioritizing, thinking “win/win,” seeking to understand before being understood, synergizing, and taking time to recharge—and if that sounds vague, it’s only because he then goes into much greater detail in the book itself, which reviewers say should be part of your permanent library.\n\n168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think by Laura Vanderkam\n\nIf it feels like you just don’t have enough time in a day to get everything done, you could just be dealing with an issue of perspective. Instead of thinking about the 24 hours in your day, try thinking about the 168 in a week—and then figuring out where the important stuff fits in there, so you’re sure to get it done. Vanderkam advocates for identifying what genuinely matters—and what doesn’t—then scheduling around it in a way that recognizes you really do have time for it. The only issue? You won’t be able to use being “too busy” as an excuse not to do the things you want to do anymore. I like this technique a lot and have used it to reframe my thinking around my busy weeks to great effect.\n\nFour Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman\n\nI've recommended one of Burkeman’s principles—the 3-3-3 method—before, but his full book, a New York Times bestseller, goes into much more detail on what he believes are the secrets to maximizing the productivity of your life. Hint: You’re going to think long-term—even longer-term than Vanderkam suggests—as the first thing you have to do is realize that not only is your life finite, but on average, you only have 4,000 weeks in it. That doesn’t seem like a lot when you think about it, right? The goal is to figure out how to use them to the best of your ability, which reviewers say the book helps with by reconciling readers with the fact that you won’t get everything done, so you have to decide what is most important to get done.",

    "fullText": "If you get a letter from a company called 700Credit, don't ignore it. Your information may have been compromised in a massive breach affecting more than 5.8 million consumers, and you should take the necessary steps to protect your data.\n\n700Credit supplies credit and identity verification services to more than 21,000 vehicle, RV, powersport, and marine dealerships in the U.S., so if you've purchased a vehicle and applied for dealer financing—or even been pre-screened or pre-qualified to do so—your information could have been affected.\n\nAccording to the company's filing with the Maine Attorney General, 700Credit's systems were hacked between Oct. 25 and Oct. 27. Attackers stole personal information about customers of 700Credit's dealership clients, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers (SSNs), and dates of birth.\n\nAs BleepingComputer reports, this breach was actually a consequence of a system compromise back in July at one of 700Credit's 200 integration partners. Threat actors were able to gain access to an API used to pull consumer data, and a security vulnerability in the API allowed them to exfiltrate information from 700Credit.\n\nIf you receive a data breach notice from 700Credit, read it carefully. 700Credit is offering 12 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through TransUnion's Cyberscout to affected consumers. You will need to go to the URL listed in your notice and enter your unique activation code in order to enroll, and you have 90 days from the date of the letter to complete the process.\n\n700Credit expects to begin notifying individuals starting on Dec. 22.\n\nIn addition to utilizing the free credit protection, you should take the usual precautions to lock down your identity:\n\nFreeze your credit at all three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion).\n\nPlace a fraud alert on your credit file. You only need to do this at one bureau, which will apply it to all three.\n\nKeep an eye on your financial accounts for suspicious transactions as well as your credit report. Note that if your credit is frozen, thieves shouldn't be able to take out new credit in your name.\n\nRequest an IP PIN from the IRS to prevent someone from filing a tax return using your SSN.\n\nFollow good digital hygiene practices, such as using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.\n\nYou cannot reverse a data breach, but you can (and should) do damage control.",

    "title": "15 Shows Like 'Emily in Paris' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "Let's all move to gay Paris.",
    "fullText": "Considering we're awaiting word of a (likely) sixth season renewal, it's undeniable that Emily in Paris has been an unqualified success for Netflix, a reliable hit that rivals the success of buzzier genre shows like Stranger Things. Lily Collins stars as the faux pas-prone Emily Cooper, who moves to Paris and lands a temporary job at a glitzy French marketing firm kind of by accident. She doesn't speak the language and doesn't get the culture, but slowly manages to ingratiate herself to the locals while juggling work and romance in a new country. The series hails from Darren Star, creator of Sex and the City, so her budding high-fashion sense and tendency to narrate adventures à la Carrie Bradshaw make perfect sense.\n\nWhile you wait for Emily's next round of misadventures, here are 15 other shows that offer similarly stylish coming-of-age vibes.\n\nInspired by the career of Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, this show follows three young besties—Jane Sloan (Katie Stevens), Kat Edison (Aisha Dee), and Sutton Brady (Meghann Fahy)—working for the fictional women's magazine Scarlet in NYC. As with Emily's mentors Madeline and Sylvie, the three are never without the firm guiding hand of editor-in-chief, Jacqueline Carlyle (Melora Hardin), as they navigate life and careers in their dramatically stylish world. Stream The Bold Type on Hulu, HBO Max, and Tubi.\n\nNo international travel here (or at least, not until the second season), but we do have a fashion-forward stylist who'd devoted herself to the wrong guy for way too long. As the series opens, Mavis (Beaumont (Michele Buteau, who also co-created the series) is ready for a fresh start, putting herself and career first—which does not preclude falling into a number of romantic entanglements. As she says more than once, she's going to take on the fashion world with a \"body-positive attitude, cute v-neck, and some lip-gloss.\" Stream Survival of the Thickest on Netflix.\n\nBefore Emily in Paris, creator Darren Star produced this two-season prequel to Sex and the City, and it's a good bet for fans of either show. Even as a 16-year-old living in Connecticut, Carrie Bradshaw (AnnaSophia Robb) is firmly on the road to becoming the iconic New York fashionista that we know she'll grow into. The high school junior takes an internship at a law firm in the Big Apple, only to moonlight from that pretty-darn-good gig by taking a second job at Interview magazine. The young Ms. Bradshaw has to balance school, family, a volatile relationship, a budding career, and a new and very outgoing bestie named Samantha (Lindsey Gort). Stream The Carrie Diaries on The CW or buy episodes from Prime Video and Apple TV\n\nThe connection here is largely based on style, as in Mrs. Maisel's impeccable period 1950s pairs nicely with Emily's heightened modern Paris, but there's also the aspect of a young woman striking out on her own, and damn the consequences. Maisel was one of Prime’s first truly buzzy original series, a comedy-drama from Amy Sherman-Palladino (Gilmore Girls) about the title’s Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), a New York housewife of the late 1950s who discovers a talent for stand-up comedy. Inspired by the real-life careers of comedians like Totie Fields and Joan Rivers, the show is warm and welcoming, with great performances and dialogue; it also achieves something rare in being a show about comedy that’s actually funny. Stream The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel on Prime Video.\n\nAmy Sherman-Palladino and David Palladino returned to TV, and to the ballet world (following Bunheads), for this series about two world-renowned ballet companies (one in NYC and one in Paris) that decide to spice things up by swapping their most talented dancers. Each company is on the brink of financial disaster, and so Jack McMillan (Luke Kirby), director of the Metropolitan Ballet, and Geneviève Lavigne (Charlotte Gainsbourg), director of of Le Ballet National, come up with the plan, and recruit an eccentric billionaire (Simon Callow) to pay for it. Much of the comedy comes from the mismatched natures of their swapped dancers, and there's a tangible love of ballet that keeps things light, despite the fancy title. The focus is a bit more on the dance directors than on the younger dancers, but there's still plenty of impeccable Parisian style on display. Stream Étoile on Prime Video.\n\nRachel Sennott (Shiva Baby, Bottoms) created, produces, writes, and stars as Maia, who is 27, living in LA, and desperate for promotion in her job as an assistant talent manager. She's joined in town by Tallulah (Odessa A’zion), a former New York City influencer fallen on messy times, and an alternately fun and exhausting circle of friends that includes West Hollywood stylist Charlie (Jordan Firstman) and Maia's teacher boyfriend Dylan (Josh Hutcherson). It's a great looking show and, though tolerance for a coming-of-age comedy about twenty-ish-year-olds in LA will vary, it's smartly written and impressively acted. Stream I Love LA on HBO Max.\n\nThere’s no high concept hook here. This critical favorite stars Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the title character (only ever referred to as Fleabag) in a comedy drama about a free-spirited, but also deeply angry single young woman in living in London who shares her romantic ups and downs via confessional asides to us, the audience. So...Emily in Paris, but messier? Waller-Bridge won separate Emmys as the star, creator, and writer of the series (all in the same year), and co-stars Sian Clifford, Olivia Coleman, Fiona Shaw, and Kristin Scott Thomas were lauded as well. Stream Fleabag on Prime Video.\n\nKimberly (Pauline Chalamet) is an endlessly naïve scholarship student; Bela (Amrit Kaur), is an aspiring comedy writer on the make for the hottest guys; Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott) is an overachieving athlete and senator’s daughter; Leighton (Reneé Rapp) is a closeted sorority girl. They're randomly assigned to room together as freshmen at the fictional Essex College in Vermont. Created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, this comedy-drama isn't nearly as salacious as its title suggests: There's sex, for sure, but like Sex and the City before it, the funny, queer-friendly show is more about female friendship. Stream The Sex Lives of College Girls on HBO Max.\n\nA young woman movies from the U.S. to France to pursue her dream of dancing. Oh, and also she's magic. A successor to Find Me in Paris, set at that show's same Paris Opera Ballet School, Spellbound introduces a new cast and, where the earlier series dealt with time travel, Spellbound is all about real magic: Fifteen-year-old American Cece Parker Jones travels to Paris to join the prestigious dance school, only to discover that she's an actual witch with a family history of spellcraft. She struggles to balance dance, magic, and her desire to be a normal teenager while dealing with the Mystics, natural enemies to Cece's type of witch. It's a solid and stylish coming-of-age drama. Stream Spellbound on Hulu.\n\nThere's no Chicago gal traveling overseas in this French series, so if you want your Parisian marketing industry workplace dramedy straight up, with no American hand-holding, you're in luck. The series shifts its focus between four talent agents at a prestigious agency who are forced to take the reins following the sudden death of the agency founder. They navigate their messy personal lives while catering to the needs of their real celebrity clients (Juliette Binoche, Monica Bellucci, Isabelle Huppert, and Sigourney Weaver are just some of the name guest stars playing faintly exaggerated versions of themselves). It's soapy, addictive showbiz fun, a dishy delight even if you know not a lick of French. Stream Call My Agent! on Netflix or buy episodes from Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\nTeen drama at its finest and most bitchy, Gossip Girl follows the many, many scandals of a group of young Upper East Side socialites and hangers-on. The tangled teenage lives of Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively), her best frenemy Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester), scholarship kid Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley), and plenty more pretty young boys and girls are chronicled in meticulous detail by the title's mysterious, omnipresent Gossip Girl (voiced by Kristen Bell). This one shares with Emily an impeccable sense of style, as its leads never miss a fashion beat. The short-lived 2021 follow-up is also available on HBO Max. Stream Gossip Girl on HBO Max and Netflix.\n\nJust as Emily's tourist kitsch gets her read for filth in the opening episode of her series, Betty Suarez (America Ferrera) has a...let's say \"distinct\" sense of fashion that sets her much apart from the rest of the striving staffers at the prestigious fashion magazine Mode, where she manages to land a job despite not quite fitting into the mold (her opening episode poncho is, of course, iconic). Betty's only coming from Queens, but her adult braces and good heart set her well apart in the catty, high-pressure world of NYC fashion. Stream Ugly Betty on Hulu.\n\nBased on the novel of the same name from Stephanie Danler, drawing on her experiences as an NYC waitress, Sweetbitter stars Yellowjackets' Ella Purnell as Tess, 21 at the series' opening, as she arrives in the city and gets a job at a prestigious restaurant. As we (and she) quickly learn, there's at least as much drama (including drugs, booze, and sex) in the restaurant industry as there is in the world of social media. Stream Sweetbitter on Prime Video.\n\nAnother Darren Star show, this one's seven-season run overlapped just a bit with Emily. It flips a more common premise on its head: rather than a young woman seeking to make a name for herself, Younger follows Liza Miller (Sutton Foster), a recently divorced woman in her 40s who finds that her age is a barrier to reentering the publishing industry she left years earlier. After a compliment convinces her that she could pass for a younger woman, she lies that she's just 26 in order to land an entry-level job. Misadventures ensue. Think of it as a story of coming-of-age, again. Stream Younger on Netflix.\n\nHow about Emily in Paris for real? This hard-hitting documentary series follows the lives of American ex-pats in Paris...just kidding, it's a Bravo reality show. Still, the vibes are not at all dissimilar, though this bit of reality TV nonsense somehow feels more heightened than the scripted drama of Emily (which probably inspired it). Six women trying to make names for themselves in the City of Lights: one a fashion designer, one an art historian, one an English teacher, etc. What they all share is a level of impeccable fashion that most people only experience by starring in a TV show.

    "description": "Make your home screen your own again.",
    "fullText": "I really like my Pixel 9a, but there’s one glaring issue with my Pixel that stares at me every time I unlock my phone. And it’s the At a Glance widget on top the screen that Google just won’t let me remove. I like a clean lock screen, and eventually, I got so frustrated looking at this totally uncustomizable widget that shows the time and the weather that I gave up and switched to Niagara Launcher. And if you think that this is just my own pickiness, I can confidently say it’s not just me; Reddit is filled with people complaining about this.\n\nBut seems like after 10 iterations of Pixels, Google is finally letting people get rid of this widget, clearing space for something, anything better than this. The new option will be part of Android 16’s QPR 3 update, which will be out sometime in March 2026. But if you install the beta, you can try it now.\n\nAndroid’s QPR betas are refreshed every quarter, and anyone with a compatible Pixel device can enroll. Visit the Android Beta Program website and enroll your device. Reboot, and you’ll be on the beta channel. It’s really easy to hop on, and it won’t require a factory reset. But getting rid of an installed beta is not so easy. Once you install the latest QPR 3 beta, you’re in for the long haul, at least until Android 16 ships the stable version in March. If something goes wrong, or if you’re facing battery issues, the only way to downgrade would be to wipe your device. So before you start, make sure you have a full backup.\n\nAt a Glance is an interesting idea, but it's rarely helpful. It's supposed to show you relevant information like the weather, your next appointment, alerts, air quality, and even suggestions from fitness apps and delivery updates. But instead, what it shows is unpredictable and pretty barebones, and it takes up valuable screen real estate. Worse, you can't customize it to make it better. I'm excited to get rid of it once and for all.\n\nOnce you’re running the latest software, it’s quite straightforward. Long press the At a Glance widget and choose the Settings option.\n\nHere, disable the new Show on home screen option below the Use At a Glance toggle. This will disable the home screen widget instantly, but you’ll still have access to it on the lock screen. Disable the Use At a Glance toggle as well to get rid of it from everywhere.\n\nAnd there you have it. Your home screen is free at last. You can leave the space empty if you wish, or, like me, you can add a big old clock right up there instead.\n\nIf you want to bring the At a Glance widget back, tap and hold on an empty part of the home screen and choose Home settings, then tap the Gear icon next to the At a Glance option. From here, you can re-enable the widget using the Show on home screen toggle.",

    "description": "And which one to get.",
    "fullText": "As you build your DIY toolkit, you'll quickly discover there's rarely just one version of any given tool. Of course there are Phillips head and slotted screwdrivers, but even hammers—possibly the simplest tool of all—come in a surprising range of varieties designed for different tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to power tools, the differences can be more complex to suss out. Take drills: When starting out on a job, how do you know if you need a standard power drill, a hammer drill, or whatever an \"impact driver\" is? While you can get pretty far in your home maintenance career without knowing the difference, but there will come a point when using the right tool for the job will make your life a lot easier. If you’ve managed to get through life without knowing the difference between a drill, a hammer drill, and an impact driver, here’s the rundown you need.\n\nDrills, impact drivers, and hammer drills are all used to drill holes and drive fasteners, but they work in different ways and are well-suited to different tasks:\n\nDrills are the easiest to understand, conceptually: Your trusty power drill spins the bit, delivering consistent, constant torque at a variety of speeds. When the motor encounters resistance, it disengages. That means that when your drill hits its limit, there’s not much more it can do to drive a fastener or bore a hole. A standard drill is good at both drilling and boring holes.\n\nImpact drivers also spin the bit and provide consistent torque—until the driver hits resistance. Then it adds a rapid, perpendicular, concussive force that temporarily increases the torque beyond what a standard drill can do. If you’ve ever hit something on the side with a hammer to loosen it, or clamped a wrench in place and hit the handle with a hammer to get a stuck bolt moving, that’s what’s going on here, but it's happening dozens of times a second. The impact driver doesn’t have a clutch and will keep working even when it hits resistance. It’s usually pretty loud, and the vibration involved can tire out your hands and arms. As a result, an impact driver isn’t great for drilling—it’s best used to drive fasteners.\n\nHammer drills operate like a standard drill, but when they’re in hammer mode (which you have to select), they deliver a downward-driving force (like a hammer hitting a nail) as opposed to the impact driver’s horizontal force. Hammer drills can operate like a standard drill if you disengage the hammer function—and like a standard drill, the motor will disengage when it hits resistance. A hammer driver in hammer mode is best for boring holes in tough materials, but not driving fasteners.\n\nKnowing how each of these tools works makes it a little easier to decide when to use one over the other. In general, here’s when to use a drill, impact driver, or hammer drill on your project:\n\nDrills are precision tools that are ideal for driving small fasteners like standard screws or boring holes into softer materials, like wood or drywall. It’s an ideal general tool for most small-scale DIY projects, and when you need more control over the driving or drilling action.\n\nImpact drivers are best used on denser materials, like very hard woods, or with larger or longer fasteners that require a lot of power to drive home. If you’ve ever tried to drive a long screw with a drill and discovered that it becomes frozen halfway through, that's when an impact driver might be the answer.\n\nHammer drills are best for drilling or fastening in very hard materials like stone, concrete, or brick—in fact, you should avoid using hammer mode on lighter materials, because it can cause damage. But because you can disengage the hammer function on most hammer drills and use them as standard drills, they can be a good multipurpose choice.\n\nOne final difference: Hammer drills and standard drills use a chuck that can accept a variety of bits, but an impact driver will only work with 1/4-inch hex-shaped bits.\n\nSince a hammer drill can also be used as a standard drill, it’s the best option if you’re not sure which tool you should get or you want to avoid buying an additional tool for a future project—it gives you both standard drill capabilities and the added power of the hammer action. You can hold off on picking up an impact driver until you tackle a project that actually calls for one.",

    "description": "The new feature gives you even more precision over your edits.",
    "fullText": "One of the ways AI models are rapidly improving is in their image editing capabilities, to the extent that they can now quickly take care of tasks that would previously have taken a substantial amount of time and effort in Photoshop. This is undoubtedly one of the main reasons Adobe has decided to introduce its own ChatGPT plug-ins.\n\nWant your t-shirt to be blue rather than red? Need to cut out a person or an object from an otherwise perfect group selfie? These are tricks that AI chatbots are now able to do cleanly and professionally, from just a text prompt. You don't need to have any digital photo editing skills; you only need to describe what you want to happen.\n\nOver the past few months, both Gemini and ChatGPT have become better at more precise edits. They're able to tweak part of an image and leaving the rest of it untouched, rather than rendering everything again from scratch just to alter one detail. Now Gemini has quietly added some more markup tools for this job.\n\nGoogle hasn't said anything officially about these markup tools, which suggests the feature is still in testing (it's also previously been spotted by the team at Android Authority). If you're not seeing these tools, try quitting and restarting the Gemini app on mobile, or refreshing the app on the web—and if you still can't see the options after that, you may have to be wait a little bit longer\n\nIf this functionality has rolled out to you, you should be able to upload an image in a chat using the + (plus) button in the prompt box, and then tap or click on the image thumbnail to find the markup tools. At the moment, they only show up before the image has been edited—you can't find them after you've started generating edits.\n\nThe easiest tool to understand is the drawing tool, which is enabled via the icon that looks like a scribble. You can use this to highlight a particular part of an image—a space in the sky, a lamppost in the street, a face in a crowd—and then describe the change you want Gemini to carry out.\n\nFor example, rather than just saying \"add a cartoon dragon in the sky\" in your prompt, you can actually combine that prompt with a circle on the image showing exactly where the dragon should go. It gives you even more of that Photoshop-level precision, without cluttering up the interface too much.\n\nThe scribblings can also be used if you're asking questions about the image. For example, you could circle an actor or an object in a scene and then ask \"who is this?\" or \"what is this?\" in the attached prompt. In that sense it works in a similar way to the Circle to Search feature that's available for images on Android.\n\nThere's also a text tool—the T icon—but I'm not sure exactly how you use this (and there's no official help available yet). You can use it to describe changes you want to apply to your picture (like \"an add arrow here\"), but the text stays in place—it's almost like a rudimentary text overlay feature, with a choice of colors but no font or styling options.\n\nYou can use the prompt to manipulate the text you've added, adding outlines and backgrounds for example, so perhaps that's the way it's intended to be used: a more precise editing option, but for text. Presumably once these tools have reached all Gemini users, we'll get some more information from Google on how to use them—but you may well find they're available to you now.",

    "fullText": "Locals band together in David v Goliath battle against facility they say would jack up bills, increase pollution and destroy area’s character\n\nA who’s who of the nation’s most powerful politicians and tech tycoons are forcing through a proposal for a massive data center in rural Michigan as locals from across the political spectrum have come out in force against it, with one calling it “uniquely evil”.\n\nSaline Township, Michigan, residents fear the $7bn center would jack up energy bills, pollute groundwater, and destroy the area’s rural character. The 1.4 gigawatt center would consume as much power as Detroit, and would help derail Michigan’s nation-leading transition to renewable energy.\n\nResponding to resident pressure, Saline Township’s board of trustees in September voted down the plans, but the data center’s powerful backers – including Donald Trump, Open AI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, utility giant DTE Energy, and Stephen Ross, the real-estate billionaire and Trump donor who owns Related Co – fought back.\n\nRelated Digital sued, and, vastly outgunned, the township board quickly folded and reversed its decision over strong resident objections. Now the project’s backers are trying to avoid minimal regulatory scrutiny on energy costs and pollution.\n\nThe controversy over the data center is representative of the David v Goliath fights playing out across the US, pitting working- and middle-class residents against the interests of billionaires and the political establishment.\n\n“This is part of an experience that America and the world is having around tech billionaires who are seizing power and widening the gap between those have much too much … and the working and middle classes,” said Yousef Rabhi, a former Democratic state legislative leader and clean energy advocate who opposes the plans.\n\n“That’s what these data centers are symbolic of, and they’re the vehicle for is the furtherance of this divide,” Rabhi added.\n\nThe proposal is part of the broader “Stargate” project composed of five data centers backed by the Trump administration, which granted $500bn in federal subsidies for them. It’s the largest project in Michigan history in terms of investment, and it also received subsidies on taxes that could have gone to roads and schools, among other uses, Rabhi said.\n\nThe plan’s supporters say the center would provide essential AI infrastructure, in part for national security, and create a few hundred jobs. Huge sums of money are at stake for the tech and utility companies.\n\nRoss’s Related Digital is the data center’s developer, while OpenAI, which produced ChatGPT, and Oracle will use the center to house its AI infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, Related Digital alleged company the township’s decision violated zoning laws, and the spokesperson stressed the suit was filed jointly with three Saline Township property owners who are selling their property to Related.\n\n“Thankfully, we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the township to allow this project to move forward,” the spokesperson said. They noted Related is also making about $14m in donations to local causes.\n\nSaline Township is a small community of about 4,000 just outside Ann Arbor. The Stargate project is one of around a dozen data center proposals in Michigan over the last year that are strongly opposed at the local level. It’s one of four proposed near Ann Arbor – last week, plans for a second a few miles away in a neighboring town surfaced.\n\nSome municipalities have been successful in derailing plans, while others have lost the fight.\n\nIn Saline Township, former US marine Kate Haushalter and her husband are raising five children in a farmhouse next to the data center site. They bought and renovated the once-dilapidated home so they could live in a bucolic area, and Haushalter said she was not about to cede ground even though the township did.\n\n“Maybe because I was in the Marine Corps, but I would rather stay and fight,” Haushalter said. “I’m sure the chances are slim, but it’s worth fighting for, and I don’t want to teach my kids to roll over.”\n\nBig tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Open AI, which often own data centers, typically have enough political support at the state and federal levels that inexperienced local leaders who are comparatively poorly resourced are left on their own to defend their town from the centers.\n\nSaline Township supervisor Jim Marion conveyed that challenge when he told angry residents during a contentious November discussion that the township’s “hands were tied”.\n\n“This township doesn’t have the money to fight these big companies. You got to understand that,” Marion told the crowd. “We were dealt the cards we were dealt.”\n\nSome municipalities have utilized zoning laws to block the centers. Beyond that, there’s little local officials can do, and state and federal level regulations on the centers are virtually non-existent.\n\nStill, residents are growing more organized. A first protest on 1 December drew about 200 people, who Rabhi described as “truly a cross-section of American society”. The next week, 800 people participated in a state-level public input session, and organizers are pressuring state environmental regulators to hold up the project’s required wetland permits.\n\nAmong residents leading the pushback is Josh LeBaron, whose home sits about 500 yards from the site, where crews have broken down.\n\nHe characterized the project as “uniquely evil” because of the environmental risks, and because, he and others allege, the companies and government have been secretive about their plans. In response to questions about accusations of nimby-ism leveled against local residents by the project’s supporters, LeBaron said he would not be opposed to other developments.\n\nHe noted that Michigan is full of former industrial sites that would be more appropriate for the 575-acre property.\n\n“I would be at home reading a book if it were a subdivision,” LeBaron said.\n\nA Related spokesperson told the Guardian the company “explored sites across Michigan before deciding on this site, which is ideal as it’s a contiguous flat area”, and is set close to a major road and transmission lines.\n\nLocal opponents’ best hope for holding up the project lies in the arcane utility regulatory process on the massive amount of power the data center would require.\n\nDTE Energy claims the data center’s power demands and need for expensive new infrastructure will not increase residential electricity prices.\n\nBut it doesn’t want to show its math.\n\nDTE filed a petition with the Michigan Public Services Commission (MPSC), the state agency that regulates utilities, asking the MPSC to fast-track the plan’s approval. DTE’s request for an “ex parte” case requires limited scrutiny of its claim that the center won’t destroy the climate laws, or increase electricity bills.\n\nIn response, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel and consumer advocacy groups filed a legal petition with the MPSC, calling for a “contested case” that would require much closer regulatory review of DTE’s claims.\n\nThe MPSC is helmed by Whitmer appointees, and the governor has strongly backed the project, raising suspicions among opponents that the agency will approve the ex parte request.\n\nStudies from across the country have shown data centers often increase rates, and DTE and regulators “cannot claim transparency while shutting the public out of the only process that requires DTE to support its claims with actual evidence”, said Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, which is intervening in the regulatory battle.\n\nIn a statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “To be clear, these data center customer contracts will NOT create a cost increase for our existing customers.”\n\nDTE has said the project won’t derail Michigan’s transition to clean energy, but state data and DTE’s plans suggest otherwise.\n\nMichigan, in late 2023, passed nation-leading climate laws that require utilities to transition to renewable energy by 2040. But the law included an “off-ramp” that allows utilities to continue running or building fossil fuel plants if renewable sources cannot handle the energy grid’s load.\n\nAt its peak, DTE’s grid already demands about 9.5 gigawatts of power, while the grid’s capacity is 11gw.\n\nIn July, DTE told investors it is in negotiations with big tech companies to provide 7gw of power for several proposed data centers.\n\nThe Saline center’s 1.4gw may not cause an exceedance of the 11gw threshold, especially because DTE is planning to build battery storage. But the Saline center along with any of the other proposed centers likely would trigger the off-ramp.\n\nDTE appears to be planning for that likelihood: DTE Energy executives said the company would likely need to build new gas plants to accommodate the data centers’ demand.\n\nHaushalter’s kids were born in the renovated farmhouse and are homeschooled there.\n\nShe and her husband try to teach the kids to respect nature. The family manages beehives, watches the geese and plant trees for wood to use in their wood-burning stove. At night, they take the kids outdoors for bonfires to look at the stars. “We’re not a big screen family,” Haushlater said.\n\nThe noise, light and air pollution is already disrupting the life the family built over 13 years. The center, if it is fully built, would fully destroy it, Haushalter said.\n\n“We are really passionate about nature and teaching our kids about it and I can’t believe the biggest construction project in Michigan is landing literally in my backyard, and there’s no recourse for the little guy,” she said. “It’s going to crush us.”",

    "fullText": "Equity says vote signals strong opposition to AI use and readiness to disrupt productions unless protections are secured\n\nActors have voted to refuse digital scanning to prevent their likeness being used by artificial intelligence in a pushback against AI in the arts.\n\nMembers of the performing arts union Equity were asked if they would refuse to be scanned while on set, a common practice in which actors’ likeness is captured for future use – with 99% voting in favour of the move.\n\nThe general secretary, Paul Fleming, said: “Artificial intelligence is a generation-defining challenge. And for the first time in a generation, Equity’s film and TV members have shown that they are willing to take industrial action.\n\n“Ninety per cent of TV and film is made on these agreements. Over three-quarters of artists working on them are union members. This shows that the workforce is willing to significantly disrupt production unless they are respected, and [if] decades of erosion in terms and conditions begins to be reversed.”\n\nThe vote was an indicative ballot designed to demonstrate the strength of feeling on the issue, with more than 7,000 members polled on a 75% turnout. However, actors would not be legally protected if they refused to be scanned.\n\nThe union said it would write to Pact, the trade body representing the majority of producers and production companies in the UK, to negotiate new minimum standards for pay, as well as terms and conditions for actors working in film and TV.\n\nEquity said it may hold a formal ballot depending on the outcome of the negotiations, which, if backed, would give actors legal protection if they were being pressed to accept digital scanning on set.\n\nThe decision comes after months of debate and growing concern about performers’ rights as AI becomes embedded in the creative industries, with high-profile actors urging Equity members to support the push to stop digital scanning.\n\nAdrian Lester, Hugh Bonneville and Harriet Walter have backed the union’s campaign to ensure AI protections for performers are written into union agreements.\n\nBonneville said actors’ likenesses and voices should not be “exploited for the benefit of others without licence or consent”, while Lester said actors at the start of their careers often found it difficult to push back against body scanning.\n\nIn October, Olivia Williams told the Guardian that performers were routinely pressed to have their bodies scanned on set without having a say over how the data was later used.\n\nThe Dune star argued that actors should have as much control over data harvested from body scans as they do over nudity scenes. She said some contracts included clauses that appeared to give studios carte blanche over a performer’s likeness “on all platforms now existing or yet to be devised throughout the universe in perpetuity”.\n\nThe arrival of the first AI “actor”, Tilly Norwood, further heightened concerns and demands for formal agreements on what is and is not permissible.\n\nIn 2023, concerns over AI were at the heart of the Hollywood writers’ strike, with writers and actors warning that unchecked use of the technology could radically reshape the industry and undermine their roles.",

He is joined in midfield by Jude Postlethwaite, who missed last weekend's defeat by Cardiff because of concussion.\n\nUlster head coach Richie Murphy has recalled several players after rotating his squad for the Cardiff game, with Nick Timoney and Juarno Augustus returning to the back row.\n\nJacob Stockdale is restored at full-back, while Rob Baloucoune - who has scored five tries this season - returns to the right wing. The first-choice half-back pairing of Nathan Doak and Jack Murphy are also recalled.\n\nEthan McIlroy is set for his first appearance since January from the bench after recovering from a knee injury.\n\nIreland forward James Ryan will earn his 100th Leinster cap in Friday's interprovincial derby.\n\nURC holders Leinster will be captained by Jack Conan, who came through graduated return to play protocols, with Caelan Doris not named in the squad.\n\nLeinster head coach Leo Cullen has made 11 changes from last weekend's Investec Champions Cup win at Leicester.\n\nNew Zealand international Rieko Ioane will play his first URC game after a couple of Champions Cup appearances, while Sam Prendergast is restored at fly-half after Harry Byrne was preferred for the Leicester game.\n\nUlster have won four out of five URC games this season while Leinster have three wins and three defeats from six. Leinster won both meetings last season, including a comprehensive 41-17 win at Aviva Stadium in April.\n\nLeinster: Frawley; Kenny, Ioane, Tector, Lowe; Prendergast, McGrath; Boyle, G McCarthy, Slimani, Deeny, Ryan, Soroka, Penny, Conan (capt).\n\nReplacements: Sheehan, P McCarthy, Furlong, J McCarthy, Deegan, Gunne, Byrne, Moloney.\n\nUlster: Stockdale; Baloucoune, Postlethwaite, McCloskey, Kok; Murphy, Doak; Bell, Stewart, O'Toole, Sheridan, Irvine, McCann, Timoney (capt), Augustus.\n\nReplacements: Andrew, Crean, Wilson, Hopes, B Ward, McKee, Flannery, McIlroy.",

Forget about the stats in terms of big averages - it had drama all the way through.\n\n\"David put in a big performance. It just backs up that we're going global with this sport.\"\n\nThe defeat continued De Decker's disappointing record at the World Championship, with the 2024 World Grand Prix winner yet to make it past the last 64 at six appearances at Alexandra Palace.",

He'd only run twice in his life and he ran in a race at Larkhill where they did back him that day but his breathing was a problem,\" said Hawke.\n\n\"We ran him at Chepstow and the amateur jockey we had on couldn't hold one side of him, but you saw what Besty did on him today and he didn't stop galloping.\n\n\"I think 300-1 was a bit ridiculous to be fair, and I'm not saying we knew what we had but we knew we had a horse with some ability and the owners always breed a nice type of horse.\n\n\"He had done nothing wrong at home and just had to learn to race. He will have learned a lot today and he can't do any more than win - and that's what he's done now. He definitely won't be 300-1 next time.\"\n\n\"It's lovely for the owners [Mr and Mrs Pudd] who are West Country people and he's a homebred, so there is a lovely story behind him.\"\n\nExeter's meeting had to pass a morning inspection after more than 50mm of rain since Monday, and with conditions described as heavy, Blowers finished three-quarters of a length in front of 5-4 favourite On The Bayou.\n\nMeanwhile, Best was fortunate to get his spot in history having picked up the ride on the morning of the race after amateur jockey Ella Herbison missed her flight.\n\nSpeaking to Racing TV, Best said: \"Ella Herbison was meant to ride him. I was on my way to riding out on the M5 at ten past six and a random unknown Irish number rang me. Sometimes I don't answer and I didn't know who it was.\n\n\"It was Ella. 'Do you want to ride one in the first at Exeter?' Sadly, she got stuck in traffic and didn't make her flight. Thank you to Ella for thinking of me and for Nigel and the owners to allow me to ride.\n\n\"He was keen the last day so Nigel said with the ground being testing, he was worried they might crawl. Plan A was to drop in last, but then we thought he might relax better in front.\n\n\"He was jumping out to his left a bit so I stayed middle to outer down the back. He's clearly handled the ground, got in a nice rhythm and thank you to all connections.\"",

    "description": "Rams vs. Seahawks predictions and NFL picks for Thursday Night Football. Los Angeles stays a step ahead of Seattle.",
    "fullText": "The top spot in the NFC is on the line when the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks face off in a heavyweight Thursday Night Football matchup.\n\nMy Rams vs Seahawks predictions and NFL picks side with the visiting Rams, who have a lot of betting trends on their side.\n\nKickoff is set for 8:15 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in beautiful Seattle, with the game airing on Prime Video on Thursday, December 18.\n\nRams vs Seahawks best bet: Rams -1 (-105)\n\nI like backing betting trends, so it’s near impossible to overlook the Los Angeles Rams in this spot at a reasonable number.\n\nLos Angeles has been one of the most reliable late-season bets in the NFL, compiling a 17–3 ATS record in their last 20 games played in the month of December. That trend has continued this year, with the Rams starting December 2–0 while piling up 86 total points against Arizona and Detroit, surpassing 500 yards of offense in both games. They’re peaking at the right time.\n\nThey’ve also dominated the spread in matchups against the Seattle Seahawks, covering 11 of the last 14 meetings, including five straight at Lumen Field. That level of consistency against a division opponent is hard to dismiss, particularly in a building that’s traditionally been difficult for visitors.\n\nRoad performance has also been a strength. Los Angeles has gone 11–2 ATS in its last 13 road games and owns a 17–5 ATS mark overall since December 1 of last season. Whether home or away, this team has shown an ability to travel and execute in high-leverage spots.\n\nEven setting trends aside, there are reasons for skepticism on the Seattle side.\n\nThe Seahawks escaped with a narrow win over the Philip Rivers-led Colts last week despite being nearly two-touchdown favorites, and while they continue to accumulate wins, Sam Darnold’s play has cooled off. It’s also very fair to question his confidence in standalone, high-pressure games after he completely melted down at the end of last season with the Vikings.\n\nThat concern is amplified by the matchup itself. The Rams are 3–0 against Darnold since the start of last season and forced him into costly mistakes, including a four-interception performance just over a month ago.\n\nTrends alone don’t decide games, but when form, matchup history, and quarterback results all point in the same direction, they deserve attention. On a short week in Seattle, the data suggests the Rams are once again positioned to continue their strong December run.\n\nIn addition to being 3-0 vs Darnold since the beginning of last season, Los Angeles has owned the Seahawks, going 11-3 ATS against them in the last 14 matchups. Look for Kyren Williams to add to his 13 total TDs vs. a Seattle defense that's allowed the most receptions in the NFL to opposing running backs.\n\nKyren Williams anytime touchdown\n\nKyren Williams Over 1.5 receptions\n\nJSN has reached the 100-yard mark in an amazing eight of his last 10 games, including going for 105 vs. the Rams on November 15. Los Angeles has allowed the sixth-most receiving yards to the wide receiver position this season.\n\nKyren Williams anytime touchdown\n\nKyren Williams Over 1.5 receptions\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba Over 95.5 receiving yards\n\nThe Rams have hit their stride during the stretch run of the season with back-to-back wins where they’ve dropped 40+ points and 500+ yards. I’m not going to stand in front of that vs Darnold, who can’t be trusted in big spots like this.\n\nWith the Rams being 17-3 ATS in their last 20 games played in December while also being 11-3 ATS in their last 14 games vs the Seahawks, I’ll happily side with them to cover.\n\nThe Under also profiles well in a matchup between two of the league’s top defenses. These teams rank second and third in points allowed and played to a 21–19 game in November that was tracking even lower before late touchdowns. Unless short fields or defensive scores swing the script, the metrics point toward a lower-scoring game.\n\nSpread: Los Angeles -1.5 (+100) | Seattle +1.5 (-122)\n\nMoneyline: Los Angeles -106 | Seattle -110\n\nOver/Under: Over 42 (-110) | Under 42.5 (-110)\n\nThe Rams are 17-3 ATS in their last 20 games played in December.

    "title": "Ranking NBA rookies: Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel in a race for highest mark in draft class grades",
    "description": "We are ranking the top rookies of the 2025 draft class with one third of the regular season complete.",
    "fullText": "Ranking NBA rookies: Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel in a race for highest mark in draft class grades originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2025 rookie class certainly hasn't disappointed. Several players have emerged as likely future All-Stars, and the depth of talent has led to players who were picked well into the second round or even undrafted that have carved out roles as solid contributors this year.\n\nTwo guys have separated themselves from the pack, and they happen to have been teammates last year. Duke alums Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel are in a neck-and-neck battle for Rookie of the Year. Knueppel took the early lead, but Flagg has closed that gap. The talent throughout the top 10 is higher than in a normal season, but those two have set the bar extremely high for the top spot.\n\nHere are the top 10 rookies through a third of the season. Grades take draft position into account.\n\nMORE: Cooper Flagg's 'clutch' stats are off the charts\n\nFlagg started the year out slowly. In retrospect, that was understandable given that he's the youngest player in his draft class and he was put on a team with point guard play so weak that he had to take on some of those responsibilities himself.\n\nAfter that initial mediocre stretch, Flagg has begun to show why scouts viewed him as a generational prospect and the surefire No.1 pick of this class. He became the youngest player to ever score 40 points in a game, breaking the record for most points by an 18-year-old that was previously held by LeBron James with his 42 against the Jazz on only 27 shots.\n\nMORE: How Mavs rookie topped LeBron in NBA's teenage scoring record books\n\nFlagg has been a two-way player, creating defensive highlights to go along with his thunderous dunks. His understanding of NBA spacing and rotations is well beyond what is normal for a typical rookie.\n\nKnueppel could easily be No. 1 on this list. His points, rebounds, and assists are very close to Flagg's. Knueppel has a bigger edge in 3-point shooting, and Flagg has contributed more impactful defense (although Knueppel is better than you might think on that end of the floor too).\n\nLet's talk about that shooting. Knueppel is going to end up as the most prolific 3-point gunner of any rookie in NBA history. He's hit a solid 40 percent of his 3's for the Hornets and maintained his scoring as the No. 1 guy on opposing scouting reports while LaMelo Ball has missed time due to an ankle injury. He's also been a very underrated driver and a good facilitator for the Hornets.\n\nOne of the first things interim head coach James Borrego did after taking over for Willie Green was to put Queen in the starting lineup.\n\nQueen has rewarded that faith. The big man looks like a truly special player in this class. Not many players can pass and score like him, and he's already shown that he is more than capable of acting as a hub for the Pelicans' offense. He became the first rookie center ever with a 30 point triple-double, dropping 33 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and four blocks against the Spurs in November, which was just one of several standout performances.\n\nThere isn't a more entertaining rookie in the paint than Fears. He came into the league with a great handle, and he finds clever ways of finishing at the rim over much bigger players. He's fast, shifty, and creative. His shaky 3-pointer from college has been at a much more solid 36 percent through the first third of his rookie season. He looks like he can be a quality lead guard going forward and has held down the starting spot in the Pelicans' lineup well.\n\nHarper came back from an early-season calf strain and didn't miss a beat. He has an uncanny knack for finishing at the rim, and his 3-pointer is starting to come around after he hit five of them in a 21-point effort during the Spurs' NBA Cup Finals loss. He has an advanced feel that has led to many saying that he plays like a veteran rather than a 19-year-old rookie.\n\nHe's saved some of his best stuff for the end of games, putting up some huge fourth quarter performances for wins while Victor Wembanyama was out. That included several clutch baskets and the eventual game-winner against the Pelicans earlier in the month.\n\nEdgecombe has been a solid all-around player for the Sixers, contributing 15.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.0 assists through his first 22 games. His elite athleticism makes it difficult for defenses to keep him out of the paint, and his defensive motor helps him defend at a high level. He has also continued to shoot 3's at a surprisingly accurate clip after knocking down just 34 percent of them in his lone year at Baylor.\n\nCoward's torrid shooting to start the season has cooled off considerably. He's still been an impact wing for the Grizzlies. He's got great size at 6-foot-6 with a 7-foot-2 wingspan, which helps make him an instant defensive plus. His motor runs very hot on the defensive end as well, where he's diving on the floor for loose balls, grabbing rebounds, and making other hustle plays. And he has still found ways to contribute on offense despite a shooting slump thanks to good cuts and finding ways to fit into the team's offense.\n\nKalkbrenner has been a monster rim protector this season, averaging 1.9 blocks per game and using every bit of his 7-foot-1 height. That has also made him one of the best finishers in the league. He's shooting an absurd 79.8 percent from the field after his first 24 games.\n\nKalkbrenner is great at the things he does well. He's a somewhat limited player though, unable to play a variety of defensive coverages and unwilling to shoot from the outside. And he turns 24 on Jan. 17, making him one of the older prospects on this list. Still, he's already established a very solid floor as a capable NBA big man.\n\nNembhard didn't play much early in the season. That was probably a mistake. He's already displaced long-time NBA veteran D'Angelo Russell as the starter in Dallas, exploding onto the national radar after a 28-point, 10-assist game against the Nuggets. The Mavericks have drastically cut down their turnovers and look like a much more organized team under the play of the rookie guard, who has proved that there is a way to survive in the NBA at just 5-foot-11.\n\nHonorable mention: Hugo Gonzalez, Sion James, Will Richard, Walter Clayton Jr., Tre Johnson, Ace Bailey, Egor Demin, Collin Murray-Boyles, Asa Newell, Will Richard, Maxime Raynaud",

    "description": "Comment: After the year of his life, the award should go to Rory McIlroy – though it does not make it a scandal if the public decides to crown someone else",
    "fullText": "Rory McIlroy will be feeling confident when he takes his seat in the audience at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award tonight. We will know that simply because of his presence in the room, and because it is an honour that still carries enough significance and prestige that you want to be there if there’s a good chance you’re going to win.\n\nOthers may disagree. McIlroy, in the past, has been among them. But then, for some, bashing the Sports Personality of the Year contest is as much of an annual ritual as the prize itself, an opportunity to take cheap shots at the BBC, among other things.\n\nMcIlroy has enjoyed an exceptional year, the stuff of dreams, spearheaded by two successes at the Masters and Ryder Cup so astonishing that they may as well have been scripted. There’s no argument against that.\n\nHe won the Masters but did so on an agonising final round that displayed his vulnerabilities and the strength to overcome them, the qualities that make him such an endearing, inspiring champion. Leading Europe to an away Ryder Cup victory, against that American crowd at Bethpage Black, further strengthens his credentials and claim to a season that stands above the rest.\n\nAnd with McIlroy, there is also the sense of if he isn’t crowned SPOTY this year, then when will he ever be? There may be an acknowledgement of legacy and past achievements now that he has completed golf’s career slam. Certainly, given Andy Murray won SPOTY three times and Lewis Hamilton has done so twice, few would argue that McIlroy would not belong in their company in terms of British sporting greats of the past 20 years.\n\nSo, sure, the Northern Irishman should probably win, but this is also a public vote, decided on the night, and the history of this award can tell us it is rarely that straightforward.\n\nAt which point, it is worth considering what may happen should McIlroy lose out, or, rather, what the reaction would be depending on who he could lose out to. The Daily Mail has already declared there would be a “stain” on SPOTY should McIlroy not win the award this year.\n\nWhy? Yes, McIlroy has the strongest case in terms of his achievements. Yes, his victory at Augusta and what Europe achieved at Bethpage Black stirred emotions and created unforgettable drama. But, increasingly, the biggest factor in SPOTY voting can be the divide between sport that is behind a paywall and sport that is open to the largest audience possible, and it is a line that McIlroy, through no fault of his own, falls on the wrong side of.\n\nIt is why Chloe Kelly or Hannah Hampton (unless they split the vote) may stand as the biggest threat to McIlroy after another major tournament victory for the Lionesses. It is why Ellie Kildunne is an excellent outside contender, and why her world champion Red Roses may beat both Europe’s Ryder Cup team and the Lionesses to team of the year.\n\nSport is ultimately at its best when it brings people together. Its power is greatest when it can uplift and inspire. Ultimately, the most-watched moment of 2025 was Hampton saving from Aitana Bonmati and Mariona Caldentey and Kelly thumping her penalty into the net as the Lionesses won the Euros again – becoming the first England football team to win a major tournament on foreign land. The victory that had within it the capacity to influence society was the Red Roses lifting the World Cup at a sold-out Twickenham, a dominant, jubilant team celebrating how it had broken down barriers while demonstrating that strength and athleticism come in different shapes and sizes.\n\nAn accusation often levelled at the BBC is that its diminished offering of live sport means it has lost other events that consistently conjured this magic, such as the Masters. But in turn, the decision to platform the Women’s Euros and Women’s Rugby World Cup has seen audiences, particularly female viewership, hit record numbers. The success of a Lionesses or Red Roses team can now become a national event in the same way as men’s football or men’s rugby. It’s almost as if making live sport accessible and these athletes visible, following decades of marginalisation and catering to the male audience, has brought in new fans and levels of interest across a broader range.\n\nThis should be celebrated. But then, this is the BBC. To some, even the all-female presenting line-up of tonight’s event, in Gabby Logan, Clare Balding and Alex Scott, is evidence of an organisation and SPOTY award that has gone overly woke and lost its shine. You can probably imagine, then, what the reaction would be should either Kelly or Hampton follow Beth Mead in 2022 and Mary Earps in 2023 and win, even if more than 16 million people watched the Lionesses’ latest tournament victory.\n\nHow the votes between Kelly and Hampton are split will be another factor as, for the first time, two members of the same team have been named on the final shortlist. Why both? It may be down to England’s bewildering summer of survival and Kelly’s rather curious role within it, the star who delivered on the biggest moments but yet did not start a match. Over the course, Hampton was integral to keeping the Lionesses alive, and the goalkeeper was unlucky not to win player of the Euro 2025 – she was certainly England’s.\n\nThe truth is that any of the six on the final shortlist would deserve to win. That includes the two individual world champions, one crowned at the start of the year and the other less than a fortnight ago, in Luke Littler and Lando Norris, both of whom are immensely popular as well. But, after the year of his life, it should be McIlroy. It does not, though, make it a scandal or bring a “stain” on the award if the public decides to crown someone else.",

    "title": "How Morocco plans to use hosting Afcon as springboard to become a global football powerhouse",
    "description": "Morocco will host the Africa Cup of Nations, which begins on Sunday",
    "fullText": "Morocco is poised to host the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) from Sunday, an event seen as a crucial stepping stone in its ambitious journey to become a global football powerhouse and a significant dress rehearsal for its co-hosting duties at the 2030 World Cup.\n\nThe North African nation, which famously reached the semi-finals of the 2022 World Cup, will welcome 24 teams from across the continent, utilising nine new or renovated stadiums in six cities.\n\nThis marks only the second time Morocco has staged the biennial tournament, yet it arrives amidst a period of intensified football engagement.\n\nThe country regularly hosts \"home\" games for other African nations during World Cup qualifiers and recently secured the rights to host five consecutive Under-17 Women’s World Cups, alongside the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in July.\n\nOfficials openly frame this Afcon as a high-visibility dry run for the 2030 World Cup, where Morocco will serve as a primary co-host alongside Spain and Portugal, with Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay each hosting a single match.\n\nA cornerstone of Morocco's grand vision is the planned Hassan II Stadium, projected to be the world's largest football arena with a capacity of 115,000 upon its completion in 2028.\n\nThis new national stadium epitomises one of Africa's most aggressive infrastructure drives.\n\nBeyond sports, Morocco has pursued rapid development across various sectors, updating airports, expanding high-speed rail networks, and attracting major tourism investments to cities such as Marrakech and Tangier, all aimed at accommodating a surge in visitors.\n\nThe Royal Moroccan Football Federation has simultaneously invested heavily in youth development and coaching, aiming to elevate standards across the sport.\n\nA prime example is the lavish Mohammed VI Football Complex near Rabat, which serves as the training base for the senior national team during the Africa Cup. This commitment to nurturing young talent appears to be yielding results.\n\nMorocco's historic run to the 2022 World Cup semi-finals was a first for any African or Arab side, and the nation further cemented its rising status by winning the Under-20 World Cup in October.\n\nFouzi Lekjaa, president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, articulated this ambition to French sports paper L’Equipe in July, stating: \"It’s not dreaming, we have legitimate ambitions.\"\n\nLekjaa, who also manages budget affairs within the Moroccan prime minister's cabinet, views sport as a vital engine for economic development.\n\nHowever, these significant investments have not been without controversy, sparking heated debate regarding the nation's priorities.\n\nWhile thousands of visitors will encounter areas rich with hotels, restaurants, new roads, and other tourist infrastructure, vast swathes of the country present a stark contrast.\n\nIn rural regions, far removed from financial hubs, residents frequently voice complaints of neglect and a lack of investment, citing critical issues such as healthcare, literacy, and employment.\n\nDuring \"Gen Z\" demonstrations earlier this year, protesters notably chanted, \"Stadiums are here but where are the hospitals,\" directly linking the substantial football investments to broader societal inequalities.\n\nYoung people, in particular, express frustration over overcrowded schools, deteriorating hospitals, and inconsistent basic services.\n\nPrime Minister Aziz Akhannouch’s government has faced accusations of channelling billions into prestige projects like stadiums instead of addressing pressing social needs.\n\nSeveral members of Morocco's national team publicly supported these protests. In October, King Mohammed VI asserted that these two categories of development were not mutually exclusive or in competition.\n\nThe tournament also unfolds as Morocco actively works to solidify its position as a regional power.\n\nThrough its \"Atlantic Initiative,\" the country has sought to deepen ties with landlocked nations in West and Central Africa, expanding the reach of its banking and telecommunications industries and offering those without coastlines access to newly constructed ports.\n\nMorocco's normalisation of ties with Israel has strengthened its relationship with the United States, and it has also garnered support from most European Union members regarding its sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara.\n\nThis issue, however, remains a source of tension with Algeria, despite a UN Security Council resolution this year that Morocco interpreted as a breakthrough.\n\nThe Polisario Front, based in southern Algeria, continues to advocate for the territory’s independence.\n\nFurthermore, while Morocco has offered tourist visas to spectators attending the Africa Cup, it has simultaneously moved in recent years to curb migration from some of the participating countries.\n\nFor instance, visa requirements for Ivorian citizens were reinstated last year, partly to deter irregular migration attempts.\n\nMorocco has long been perceived as a gateway to Europe, sharing a border with the EU via the Spanish territories of Ceuta and Melilla on the North African coast, and with Spain’s Canary Islands approximately 100 kilometres away.\n\nThe kingdom has drawn criticism from migrant rights groups for its aggressive enforcement measures, including clearing encampments and relocating migrants to remote areas far from European borders.\n\nThe Moroccan Association for Human Rights’ Rabat branch reported an increase in arbitrary arrests and forced expulsions of migrants in the run-up to the Africa Cup this week.\n\nThe Africa Cup of Nations final is scheduled for 18 January at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, which opened in September.",

Mohun Bagan have also forfeited any subsidy for participating in the continental second-tier tournament.\n\nMohun Bagan were withdrawn from the competition after they refused to travel to Iran for the group stage match, citing a lack of security assurances and medical insurance coverage in Iran, and their matches were declared null and void by the AFC.\n\nThe club had moved to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), asking for the match to be relocated to a neutral venue, but CAS turned down their initial request.\n\n“The players decided they can’t take this risk, where lives and their families’ future are at stake. So we have to stand with them,” a senior Mohun Bagan official told the Reuters news agency.\n\nMohun Bagan have five players from Australia, Spain and the United Kingdom, countries that have advised their citizens against travel to Iran, the official added.\n\nThe club also did not travel to Iran last year for a match against Tractor SC scheduled for October 2, 2024, the day after Iran launched ballistic missiles towards Israel. Mohun Bagan were withdrawn from the tournament as a result.\n\nMohun Bagan are considering appealing against the suspension, the official said.",

    "fullText": "Though Arsenal won’t play their League Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace until next week, the draw for the semi-final has already been completed, with the winner of the Gunners’ quarter-final due to face Chelsea in early 2026.\n\nThe two-legged semi-final tie will begin with a game at Stamford Bridge on January 13th-14th, followed by a second leg at either the Emirates Stadium or Selhurst Park on February 3rd-4th.\n\nBut regardless of whether Arsenal or Crystal Palace progress, Moises Caicedo will be suspended for the Stamford Bridge first leg.\n\nCaicedo received a booking against Cardiff City for sarcastically applauding a refereeing decision, having also received a yellow in his previous League Cup game against Wolves.\n\nTwo yellows in the League Cup means a one-game ban, and the yellows are only wiped after the quarter-finals.

    "description": "Discussions are ongoing to try and secure a WRC programme for rising star Martins Sesks",
    "fullText": "M-Sport Ford is involved in ongoing discussions to add Martins Sesks to its World Rally Championship driver line-up for 2026.\n\nThe British squad announced its full-time driver line-up for next year this week, which sees Josh McErlean joined by European Rally Championship title runner-up Jon Armstrong – who will make the leap to Rally1 machinery for the first time. The decision comes as part of an expanded collaboration with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy, which has long supported Irish rising stars McErlean and Armstrong.\n\nJon Armstrong joins Josh McErlean in new M-Sport Ford WRC 2026 line-up\n\nThe announcement failed to mention Gregoire Munster, who piloted a Ford Puma Rally1 for the past two seasons and Sesks, who enjoyed part-time campaigns in both 2024 (three rallies) and 2025 (seven rallies).\n\nHowever, M-Sport did state in its press release that “further announcements on M-Sport’s remaining line-up will be made soon”.\n\nSpeaking to Motorsport.com, team principal Richard Millener didn’t rule out the possibility of both Munster and Sesks joining the team again in some form in 2026.\n\nSesks in particular helped his cause for 2026 by delivering a stunning drive in last month’s season finale in Saudi Arabia, where he challenged for victory until punctures and an engine issue ended his rally on the final day.\n\nMillener says discussions are ongoing, but admitted Sesks won’t be joining the team at the January season opener in Monte Carlo.\n\n“It is not a pick and choose exercise and just because he [Martins] did well in Saudi we have got the budget to put him in for a year. People are dreaming a bit there,” said Millener.\n\n“We are still in negotiations with him for sure and we would like to see him in the team. He won’t be in Monte Carlo, but we are working to try and see what we can do. There are still ongoing discussions, so it is not dead.”\n\nReflecting on being able to find the necessary budget to ensure that the team can continue to field two cars for the full season next year, Millener added: “We have been working on it for a while in the background to try and find a way to be there next year, and you know how hard it is for us to do that, and I think it is quite pleasing to have a solid line-up for all the rallies.\n\nFIA announces new constructor set to join WRC 2027\n\nHow Hayden Paddon got his second shot in WRC\n\n\"It was always the intention to have a second year with Josh. You need at least two years, one to learn and one year to start improving yourself, and you need more than that.\n\n“For Jon, it was something that came very late in the day. His results in the last couple of ERC rounds was really an eye catcher, and it was something Malcolm [Wilson, M-Sport founder], John Coyne [Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy] and myself talked about a few rallies ago about the concept of giving Jon the opportunity.\n\n“Everyone was in agreement, and we have found a way to do that. It is a bigger collaboration with the rally academy, which is great and it means we have two interesting youngsters lining up for the full season, which is the main goal.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The queen of Thailand on Thursday won a gold medal in sailing at the Southeast Asian Games, a regional competition being held in her country this month.\n\nQueen Suthida, the wife of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, competed in the mixed keelboat SSL47 category, on a 47-foot (14-metre) sailboat with nine other crew members.\n\nThe queen, 47, served as tactician and helmswoman to lead the Thai team to victory in the waters off Pattaya, ahead of Malaysia and Myanmar.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn, 73, presented gold, silver and bronze medals to the winners Thursday evening -- including to Suthida, whom he married in 2019.\n\nHer team, dressed in matching black sailing attire, celebrated earlier aboard their boat with cheers, while one sailor waved the Thai national flag.\n\nA communications graduate, Suthida worked as a flight attendant for Thai Airways before embarking on a career in the military.\n\nA keen athlete, she ran a half marathon in 2:13:40 this month in the capital Bangkok alongside Kenyan running legend Eliud Kipchoge.\n\nThe queen led the Thai delegation at the opening ceremony of the SEA Games on December 9 in Bangkok.\n\nSuthida is not the first member of the royal family to win gold in sailing.\n\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej, the father of Vajiralongkorn, sailed in the fourth edition of the regional Games, held in Thailand in 1967.\n\nCompeting in the OK class on a boat he built himself, Bhumibol won a gold medal alongside his eldest daughter, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, according to the SEA Games website.\n\nThe Games end on Saturday, with host Thailand well ahead in the medal count, followed by Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\nEleven countries were initially scheduled to take part, but Cambodia withdrew for security reasons after a border conflict with the host country reignited days before the opening ceremony.",

    "description": "Crystal Dynamics announced Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis last week at The Game Awards, calling it a reimagining of the original 1996 Tomb Raider. While the studio wants to stay faithful to the original, it has also said it plans to tone down the brutal difficulty of the nearly 30-year-old PlayStation 1 game.\nSpeaking in a press conference, as reported by GamesRadar, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked about adapting the original PS1 game specifically when it comes to difficulty. Like many games of its era, the 1996 game was known to have its punishingly difficult sections, including insta-kill death traps that were often near-impossible to avoid without the benefit of hindsight.\n\"Part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes,\" Kerslake said, and though he doesn't explicitly mention difficulty it seems safe to say that Legacy of Atlantis will have far fewer insta-kills.",

    "fullText": "on December 18, 2025 at 3:29AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nThe best co-op Xbox games should get you yelling, cheering, and strategizing your way to a shared victory. Whether you’re sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with a friend or coordinating online across continents, there’s something uniquely enjoyable about overcoming challenges together.\n\nXbox’s ecosystem, bolstered by Game Pass and cross-platform support, has become a standout destination for cooperative play of all kinds. From story-driven adventures built entirely around teamwork to sprawling survival sandboxes that let players create their own world, the platform offers one of the richest selections of co-op experiences anywhere--often without the need to break the bank.\n\nThis list isn’t about the biggest names; it’s about games that foster connection. Some push innovation in engaging cooperative gameplay, others are great drop-in titles for visiting friends, and a few provide you with enough ridiculous moments to break ice of any thickness. Whatever your preferred genre or style of co-op play, you'll find something on this list that'll have you coordinating, competing, and celebrating with your pals.\n\nFew games embody the spirit of cooperation as fully as It Takes Two. Designed from the ground up to require two players, this award-winning adventure blends platforming, puzzle-solving, and genre-hopping creativity into one of the most joyful (but also emotionally-devastating) couch co-op experiences available.\n\nEvery chapter introduces new mechanics, from magnet-powered abilities to time-manipulation sequences. These developments often echo the emotional journey of the two emotionally fraught characters, and progress demands communication, synchronization, and trust. It Takes Two's Friend’s Pass makes it even more accessible, allowing one purchase to cover both players, or to experience a demo if you've not yet taken the plunge. Whether you’re battling giant squirrels in the wild or navigating miniature worlds inside a child’s room, the adventure confronts you with themes of unity, loyalty, and the depths of familial love. It Takes Two remains one of the best co-op experiences not just on Xbox, but in gaming as a whole.\n\nHalo has long defined cooperative shooting on Xbox, with many entries in the series still regarded as the best shooters by many, and The Master Chief Collection stands as the definitive way to experience the franchise with friends. This massive compilation includes six full campaigns, all playable cooperatively (although cross-play only works for Halo 3-4 main campaign and ODST).\n\nEach entry offers a slightly different flavour of teamwork, from the tense corridors of the original to the squad-based vehicular chaos of later games, and offers more than 120 multiplayer maps as well as community-created co-op content.\n\nOnline co-op allows up to four players in many campaigns, while local play supports two, making it ideal for both couch and online sessions. While still a good nostalgic time, performance improvements and quality-of-life updates have polished the experience significantly since launch. Whether you’re revisiting the series or discovering it for the first time, The Master Chief Collection remains a benchmark for cooperative FPS gameplay and an essential piece of Xbox history. Why not play it on the console it was made for?\n\nPowerwash Simulator 2 builds on the surprisingly addictive formula of the original by expanding environments, tools, and multiplayer options into a full-fledged shared experience in online, shared, and split-screen co-op. The premise is simple (you just clean things) but the game's simplicity gives way to relaxing, collaborative gameplay that'll see hours pass by as if they were minutes. Working together to restore derelict vehicles, muddied murals, and crusty old houses, turns into a calming blend of methodical cleaning and quiet teamwork. You could even use it to catch up about the day's events.\n\nThe sequel features more intricate multi-stage jobs, improved water physics, and new powerwasher customization options. Co-op lets you divide and conquer or tackle hard-to-reach angles together, and communication naturally emerges as you and your partner strategize how to approach each mess. It’s the kind of game that encourages conversation, turning long sessions into both a chill hangout and a satisfying completionist exercise. If you’re looking for low-stress, feel-good co-op where you can yap over low-stakes gameplay, Powerwash Simulator 2 is an excellent choice. Keep an eye out for new DLC, updates, and free content coming in 2026.\n\nChaotic, unpredictable, and consistently hilarious, Totally Reliable Delivery Service is a physics-based sandbox where the goal of delivering packages is often less central than the floppy hijinks that happen along the way.\n\nUp to four players can join forces to race, tumble, awkwardly grapple, and ragdoll their way through a world packed with toys, vehicles, and interactive objects. The intentionally wobbly controls mean getting just about anything done is a bit of an adventure, whether you're desperately hanging onto a helicopter carrying a fragile box or launching your team into orbit with explosive machinery. Have you delivered anything in one piece? Probably not. Did you have fun doing it? Absolutely. Totally Reliable Delivery Service rarely punishes failure; in fact, failure is often the best part. It's a reliably funny pick for friend groups who are happiest when embracing the absurd.\n\nWhile Formula 1 might initially seem like a solitary sport, what with being alone in the cockpit of a car for most of it, F1 25 brings in an element of competitive and cooperative racing thanks to solid online functionality and couch co-op modes.\n\nWhether you want to compete on the same team or join a full multiplayer grid, the sense of shared progression makes the game a bit more immersive than just blasting through countless races on your own. Although we missed an F1 game in 2026, the game’s refined physics, snappy circuits, and broadcast-quality vibe make it feel every bit the modern game. It's not bad for first-time drivers, either, with accessible assists ensuring new players can keep up. F1 25 can also be played in VR, so if you're a fan of great VR games, you can literally put yourself in the driver's seat for this one.\n\nWe don't often give games 10/10 but in our Split Fiction review, we had to award this highest of accolades. This game truly is an unmissable co-op experience on Xbox. It has to be played to be believed.\n\nSplit Fiction is a two-player adventure from the creators of It Takes Two, another that made the list. Like the studio’s earlier title, every element--from puzzle design to narrative progression--requires genuine teamwork. It's not just a slapped on multiplayer mode, but a game built for two.\n\nProtagonists Mio and Zoe are full of character and charm, traversing beautifully realized realities that shift between sci-fi structures, fantastical landscapes, and surreal dream spaces, each introducing new mechanics that emphasize collaboration, and each written or imagined by the leads themselves. It's a literary tale of friendship and creative identity, bringing together two disparate characters and their inner worlds. Whether you're manipulating time, controlling gravity, or using asymmetric abilities to bridge gaps, both players remain equally essential throughout the experience. We can't sing its praises enough.\n\nThe Hazelight Friend Pass returns, allowing two people to play with only one copy of the game, and lowering the barrier to entry. You've really got no excuse not to play one of 2025's best games on Xbox.\n\nGrounded 2 is still in development so while you can play it on Xbox GamePass, and it's one of the best current Xbox GamePass games, it might have plenty of… bugs (sorry). It's a tried and tested formula, though, by shrinking players to insect size and dropping them into a backyard teeming with danger, Grounded 2 transforms everyday blades of grass into towering forests and ants into territorial predators, expanding on the groundwork established by the original game.\n\nCo-op is where the game's survival-crafting elements truly shine. Up to four players can work together to build bases, craft survival tools, and explore the expansive yard, discovering secrets and confronting increasingly hostile creatures. The dynamics of survival feel more approachable and enjoyable when shared, and it's a nice light-hearted alternative to usually gloomy survival games. With ongoing updates until the game leaves early access, Grounded 2 continues to expand its world, so now is the perfect time to jump in with both feet.\n\nVampire Survivors lets up to four players combine chaotic builds as they face endless waves of monsters in increasingly wild arenas. Cooperative play drastically alters the game’s single-stick shooter rhythm--abilities overlap, bullets multiply, and strategic synergy becomes more important as enemies flood the screen. It. Is. Chaos.\n\nLocal co-op for up to 4 players makes it easy to team up and introduce new friends to this bullet storm breakthrough. You can revive each other, share pickups, and lean into different upgrade paths to balance damage, defense, or support roles. The game’s quick sessions make it ideal for players looking to jump in for fast, intense runs without heavy time commitments. Despite its simple, retro aesthetic, Vampire Survivors delivers one of the most engaging co-op loops on Xbox thanks to its unpredictability, progression system, and endlessly satisfying power curve. Also: big walls of bullets are always fun.\n\nOvercooked! remains one of the definitive couch co-op series thanks to its frantic kitchen chaos, escalating absurdity, and teamwork that pushes friendships to their limits. Overcooked! All You Can Eat combines both games into one delicious dish, along with plenty of new content and a full remaster.\n\nUp to four players must coordinate to chop ingredients, cook dishes, wash plates, and serve recipes under increasingly ridiculous scenarios--just try not to lose your cool, it's surprisingly easy to do so. Communication becomes both your greatest weapon and source of silliness as plans fall apart and the group scrambles to salvage orders before the timer runs out. The addition of online multiplayer broadens accessibility, while new recipes, mechanics, and cooperative abilities enhance the game's replayability. Whether you’re cooperating to serve a dish you'd be proud of, or accidentally sabotaging each other in the heat of the moment, Overcooked! is one of the best value for money party games on Xbox where just about anyone can instantly enjoy.\n\nSet within a sprawling, disaster-stricken research facility, Abiotic Factor blends survival, crafting, base-building, and exploration. Up to six players can work together as brilliant scientists navigating dangerous anomalies, otherworldly creatures, and the remnants of failed experiments. The game encourages players to take on complementary roles, from security teams and engineers to phytogenic botanists, each contributing unique skills to group survival.\n\nCo-op builds naturally as you divide tasks like defending choke points, researching new tools, or expanding secure safe rooms--remember, you do have to live here too. Environmental puzzles and randomized threats keep sessions unpredictable, while its emphasis on exploration rewards groups who communicate and plan. Abiotic Factor is a co-op Xbox game that'll have you hooked right from the start with its ridiculous tongue-in-cheek humor and limitless possibilities.\n\nA timeless sandbox classic and all-round cozy game, Terraria transforms into an entirely different experience when played cooperatively. With friends, its vast 2D world becomes a shared playground where you can collaborate on ambitious structures, share resources, and tackle bosses that benefit from coordinated combat. The Paladin's Shield accessory, for example, functions best in multiplayer, bolstering the team's defences with a buff that pulls damage onto the wearer.\n\nThe game’s progression system encourages players to split up tasks--mining for ores, exploring biomes, gathering rare items, or defending home bases, for example--while coming together for major milestones like defeating the Wall of Flesh and advancing into Hardmode. Co-op amplifies the game’s sense of discovery as players uncover secrets and generate shared stories, structures, and in-game lives. Even more than a decade after release, Terraria remains endlessly replayable thanks to frequent updates, deep crafting systems, and open-ended creativity.",

    "description": "Is ChatGPT conservative or liberal? A novel approach to assess ideological stances and biases in generative LLMs",
    "fullText": "Published online by Cambridge University Press: \n 03 December 2025\n\nExtant work shows that generative AI such as GPT-3.5 and perpetuate social stereotypes and biases. A less explored source of bias is ideology: do GPT models take ideological stances on politically sensitive topics? We develop a novel approach to identify ideological bias and show that it can originate in both the training data and the filtering algorithm. Using linguistic variation across countries with contrasting political attitudes, we evaluate average GPT responses in those languages. GPT output is more conservative in languages conservative societies (polish) and more liberal in languages used in liberal ones (Swedish). These differences persist from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4. We conclude that high-quality, curated training data are essential for reducing bias.\n\nGPT-3.5 and -4 are increasingly popular among scholars to generate data, classify text, and complement human coders. Their black-box nature, however, has raised concerns about bias in model output, which in turn has led to a burgeoning debate around the politics of artificial intelligence (AI) and how to regulate generative models. In this article, we identify ideological biases in GPT-3.5 and -4 through a novel approach that matches model output to known linguistic and issue-based differences across countries. If biases exist, GPT-3.5 and -4 will reflect the predominant political attitudes of those who produced the training text. In countries where society is more conservative (liberal), GPT models will produce more conservative (liberal) output. Moreover, OpenAI, the company that developed and owns these models, heavily filters the GPT-4 API to reduce output bias, but it does not filter the GPT-3.5 complete API (Heikkilä, Reference Heikkilä2023). This gives us an opportunity to also identify bias across OpenAI models, and disentangle biases stemming from the training data from those that derive from the algorithm or filters.\n\nWe focus our analysis on two key LLM tasks: text generation and annotation.Footnote 1 For text generation, we focus on political issues that are linguistically and geographically constrained: abortion and Catalan independence. For abortion, we draw text data from GPT-3.5 and -4 in Swedish, Polish and English. In Poland, society tends to be socially conservative, while Sweden is more progressive (Sydsjö et al., Reference Sydsjö, Josefsson, Bladh and Sydsjö2011; Koralewska and Zielińska, Reference Koralewska and Zielińska2022). Because training data in these two languages comes almost exclusively from their respective countries, we expect GPT responses to reflect more conservative views of abortion in Poland and more liberal ones in Sweden. We use English output on abortion primarily to test the full extent of OpenAI’s filtering efforts, which have been concentrated on English text (Motoki et al., Reference Motoki, Neto and Rodrigues2024; Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024). For Catalan independence, we draw data in Catalan and Spanish. Because Catalan society is, on the whole, more pro-independence than Spanish society (Llaneras, Reference Llaneras2017), we expect GPT responses in Catalan to be more positive toward independence than responses in Spanish (within the Spanish-speaking world, Catalan independence is only a politically salient and divisive issue in Spain (Llaneras, Reference Llaneras2017)).\n\nFor annotation, we focus on a dataset of English language tweets about content moderation focusing on the salient topics of (1) economics and (2) health and safety (Gilardi et al., Reference Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli2023). We again focus on Swedish and Polish across GPT-3.5 and -4 by translating the tweets to these languages and asking the LLM to classify each tweet according to whether they lean more liberal or conservative. Again, we expect the LLMs to reflect the economic and health policy leanings predominant in Polish and Swedish societies, with Polish exhibiting a more conservative lean and Swedish responses being more left-leaning, on average. Poland’s economic policies prioritize conservative developmental statism to strengthen the economy and combat ‘progressive’ ideologies including liberalism and socialism (Bluhm and Varga, Reference Bluhm and Varga2020). Meanwhile, Sweden’s economic policies have historically leaned toward the left, characterized by higher government spending, progressive taxation, and a focus on social welfare (Andersson, Reference Andersson2022). Likewise, Sweden’s health policies are more left-learning, focusing on social democratic ideals such as equality and the welfare state (Vallgårda, Reference Vallgårda2007). Poland’s health policies have a mix of conservative and redistributive elements, sometimes described as ‘conservative welfare state populism’ (Zabdyr-Jamróz et al., Reference Zabdyr-Jamróz, Löblová, Moise and Kowalska-Bobko2021). Therefore, through these two issues, and by tapping into languages and issues that are geographically confined, we can identify whether (1) GPT output reflects ideological biases in the training data and (2) OpenAI’s filtering fixes these biases or induces new ones.\n\nWe use multilevel modeling to identify significant differences in outputs for both LLM tasks and specify two distinct types of biases: training and algorithmic. We provide novel evidence on ideological biases in OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and -4, showing that bias can derive from both the training data and the algorithm. More broadly, our analysis shows that biases are likely to remain an issue through the different GPT models beyond GPT-3.5 and -4. Importantly, we show that biases are consistent across different LLM tasks such as text generation and annotation, which is relevant to the growing literature showing that biases may be task-dependent (Lunardi et al., Reference Lunardi, Barbera and Roitero2024). Our findings regarding these two sources of bias have major implications for the politics of AI, the training and regulation of generative models, and applied researchers looking to use these models in downstream analyses, such as in text classification, sentiment analysis and question-answering (Ray, Reference Ray2023).\n\nTesting for ideological biases in GPT-3.5 and -4 is especially relevant because a growing number of articles use these models in measurement and downstream tasks (Argyle et al., Reference Argyle, Busby, Fulda, Gubler, Rytting and Wingate2023; Buchholz, Reference Buchholz2023; Le Mens et al., Reference Le Mens, Kovács, Hannan and Pros2023; Lupo et al., Reference Lupo, Magnusson, Hovy, Naurin and Wängnerud2023; Wu et al., Reference Wu, Nagler, Tucker and Messing2023; Mellon et al., Reference Mellon, Bailey, Scott, Breckwoldt, Miori and Schmedeman2024; O’Hagan and Schein, Reference O’Hagan and Schein2024). For example, GPT has been used in annotation tasks to classify the tone of text or assign topic labels (Ornstein et al., Reference Ornstein, Blasingame and Truscottn.d). Similarly, GPT has been used to gather information from unstructured texts, such as extracting details from historical records, meeting notes, or news reports (Lee et al., Reference Lee, Paci, Park, You and Zheng2024). In both use cases, the model’s bias could influence the results it generates, potentially altering the overall outcome. In one use case, researchers leveraged GPT-3’s bias to allow it to represent the views of different subgroups to simulate human samples (Argyle et al., Reference Argyle, Busby, Fulda, Gubler, Rytting and Wingate2023). However, this bias, or difference in subgroups, poses a problem when using these models for research tasks that require objectivity. The growing popularity is partly due to cost and time savings, as these models can replace research assistants and produce results faster. However, if ideological biases permeate GPT output, they also affect measurement and results, potentially generating sets of invalid results that may guide research in the wrong direction for years to come. Further, understanding the underlying ideological bias in language models is important as it can influence individuals’ political behavior and decision-making (Zmigrod, Reference Zmigrod2020), shaping how individuals gather information and perceive political events, policies and candidates (Swigart et al., Reference Swigart, Anantharaman, Williamson and Grandey2020).\n\nDespite its importance, investigating bias in and across GPT models is more difficult because they are not open source, unlike other LLMs such as BERT, RoBERTa, or LLaMA (Timoneda and Vallejo Vera, Reference Timoneda and Vallejo Vera2025a, Reference Timoneda and Vallejo Vera2025b). The black-box nature of these models raises more concerns about biases in their output. Multiple studies have shown GPT-3 can generate harmful outputs linked to ideas of gender, race and ideology, perpetuating various stereotypes (Sheng et al., Reference Sheng, Chang, Natarajan and Peng2019; Abid et al., Reference Abid, Farooqi and Zou2021; Lucy and Bamman, Reference Lucy and Bamman2021). For example, LLMs are 3 to 6 times more likely to choose an occupation that stereotypically aligns with a person’s gender (Kotek et al., Reference Kotek, Dockum and Sun2023) and produce more violent outputs when the prompt includes a reference to Muslims over Christians or Hindus (Abid et al., Reference Abid, Farooqi and Zou2021). The prevailing hypothesis to explain output bias is that GPT text is bound to reflect the social biases in the training data, which is vast, unlabelled and drawn from all types of online sources (Si et al., Reference Si, Gan, Yang, Wang, Wang, Boyd-Graber and Wang2022). Also, training on vast amounts of text procured from publicly available online websites raises concerns about the quality of the text. It is likely that models learn biased patterns from the data. For example, GPT-3.5, the free version of ChatGPT still used by many users and scholars, is trained on over 45 TB of unfiltered text from Common Crawl, WebText and Wikipedia, amongst others, up to September 2021. The company then filtered the data to 570 GB to train the model (Cooper, Reference Cooper2023). Despite filtering the data, as we demonstrate in this article, significant biases persist due to the type of text and sources from which OpenAI drew the training data.\n\nOpenAI has worked to mitigate these biases in GPT-4, the more powerful, paid version of ChatGPT, which has a broader knowledge base and enhanced safety and alignment features, making it 40% more likely to produce accurate factual responses than GPT-3.5 (Kelly, Reference Kelly2024). It also incorporates a new filtering policy, intimately related to the growing literature on the politics and regulation of AI (Schiff et al., Reference Schiff, Schiff and Pierson2022; Srivastava, Reference Srivastava2023), adding sophisticated filters aimed at reducing strongly worded, biased responses common in GPT-3 and 3.5 (OpenAI, 2024). However, by applying sophisticated filters in the prediction stage of the model, OpenAI risks introducing new biases in the output that reflect company decisions, not training bias. Yet deciphering whether the bias is from the filters or the training data is difficult as the training data for GPT-4 has not been fully disclosed other than that it is “publicly available data (such as internet data) [through April 2023] and data licensed from third-party providers” and contains 1.76 trillion parameters, improving upon GPT-3.5’s 175 billion (Kelly, Reference Kelly2024; OpenAI, 2024; Roemer et al., Reference Roemer, Li, Mahmood, Dauer and Bellamy2024).\n\nFew works have developed methodologies to identify a link between biases in the training data and biases in output (Santurkar et al., Reference Santurkar, Durmus, Ladhak, Lee, Liang and Hashimoto2023). Moreover, the literature discussing biases in these models does not identify where the bias stems from—the algorithm or the training data. This is partially due to the focus on the English language in extant work (Motoki et al., Reference Motoki, Neto and Rodrigues2024; Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024). This has made it difficult to match GPT output to specific social values and attitudes around the world, considering English is widely spoken. Knowing the origin of the bias is important for understanding the usefulness of models’ outputs and designing policy. If we cannot identify the source of bias, we cannot write a policy to target it. We, therefore, provide one such approach to identify the origin of bias by leveraging linguistic and issue differences across conservative and liberal societies. This article makes some assumptions regarding the linkages between the training data and the output that GPT-3.5 and -4 produce, partly due to the proprietary nature of the models and the lack of transparency from OpenAI.Footnote 2 Yet our findings provide strong initial evidence that GPT-3.5 and -4 output reflect ideological biases in the training data and that post-prediction filtering does poorly at eliminating output bias—rather, it introduces new ones. Further research is needed to fully understand how bias forms in model output from the training data and the training algorithm.\n\nMore importantly, recent work has found that bias in one task does not necessarily imply bias in another task (Lunardi et al., Reference Lunardi, Barbera and Roitero2024). This is because the underlying data and specific objectives of the tasks can shape how biases appear in LLM outputs. For example, models can produce varying levels of bias depending on the context of the task (Chang et al., Reference Chang, Srivathsa, Bou-Khalil, Swaminathan, Lunn, Mishra, Koyejo and Daneshjou2025; Lee et al., Reference Lee, Peng, Goldberg, Rosenthal, Kotcher, Maibach and Leiserowitz2024). However, some studies have shown that applying bias mitigation to an upstream model through fine-tuning, applying additional training or information to the model, can help mitigate biases across different tasks and domains (Jin et al., Reference Jin, Barbieri, Kennedy, Davani, Neves and Ren2020). Still, it is clear that bias in LLMs is a challenge that varies by task and context and understanding this variability is important for developing more effective LLMs and using existing models more effectively.\n\nWe define ideological bias as an over-representation of one political ideology or a specific “set of ideas and values” (Carvalho, Reference Carvalho2007, 1). This follows the concept of media bias, which classifies bias as the presence of an over or under-representation of a particular opinion (Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024). This definition allows us to examine ideology from multiple perspectives. First, we consider ideology in the context of the U.S. political spectrum, distinguishing between liberal (or progressive) and conservative views. Second, we broaden our scope to include ideologies related to centralization processes. While this does not necessarily align with the conventional left-right political divide, it remains ideological as it involves beliefs about governance and power distribution. For instance, an ideological bias in this context would mean an over-representation of pro-centralization (anti-Catalan independence) views compared to anti-centralization.\n\nGiven this, we have two main findings. First, GPT abortion output is significantly more liberal in Swedish and conservative in Polish for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Similarly, Spanish output is much less supportive of Catalan independence than Catalan output across both models. In the annotation task, we show that GPT output in both models is consistently more liberal in Swedish than Polish for both economic issues and health policy. Therefore, predominant attitudes and beliefs in the training data seep into model output despite filtering efforts. Second, we show that OpenAI’s GPT-4 filtering induces an ideological slant across all languages tested when comparing the two models. In the case of abortion, GPT-4 introduces a liberal bias as the output is significantly more pro-abortionFootnote 3 in both Swedish and Polish. Likewise, GPT-3.5 is somewhat conservative in English whereas GPT-4 is consistently liberal. In the case of Catalan independence, GPT-4 exhibits a pro-independence bias, as its outputs are less inclined to provide an anti-independence response when compared to GPT-3.5. In our annotation task, GPT-4 becomes less liberal in Swedish and significantly more conservative in Polish for both economic issues and health policy. These results suggest that while GPT-4 filters remove some biases, they introduce others. This finding explains the growing consensus that GPT-4 has a liberal skew (Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024), even though our results also show that this may be limited to sensitive issues where filters are set to not take clear positions to avoid insensitive answers. Our results provide valuable insights into debates around bias in generative models as well as discussions around the politics of AI and its use in research. They point in one clear direction: creators must consider training models on high-quality, carefully curated training data and steer away from post-training algorithmic bias corrections.\n\nWe generate GPT-3.5 and -4 output for two tasks: text generation and annotation. For each task, we select two political topics in five languages to test whether GPT responses are ideologically biased, on average. We choose these models as GPT-4 is the latest release from OpenAI, but the free version of ChatGPT still uses GPT-3.5. Since many researchers and everyday users still use GPT-3.5, its biases remain relevant. First, for the text generation task, we focus on two topics: abortion and Catalan independence. Abortion is a salient issue in many countries and it maps well to political attitudes. Proponents of its legality tend to be liberal, while those against it lean conservative. Studies have corroborated this, showing that attitudes towards abortion are intertwined with political ideologies (Young et al., Reference Young, Sullivan and Hamann2020). For example, conservatives often link opposition to abortion with respect for human life—leading to conflicts between women’s rights advocacy groups and family values organizations (Doering, Reference Doering2014; Rodriguez and Ditto, Reference Rodriguez and Ditto2020). Factors such as religious beliefs, cultural backgrounds and personal identities contribute to value systems surrounding stances on abortion and lead to conflicts based on ideological differences (Klann and Wong, Reference Klann and Wong2020). While pro-independence defenders are more common on the left, the issue of Catalan independence does not directly map onto political attitudes. However, it remains a highly divisive and ideological issue. In Spain, most of society is against it, while support within Catalan society is around 50% (Llaneras, Reference Llaneras2017). Second, for the annotation task, we use text in two politically salient topics, economics and health (Gilardi et al., Reference Gilardi, Alizadeh and Kubli2023).Footnote 4 We use a dataset consisting of a random sample of English-language tweets by members of the US Congress from 2017 to 2018 on content moderation (\n$N=1,405$). This dataset has each tweet labeled as one of 14 frames, or topics. The topics were originally labeled by ChatGPT, and the original article found that this model was more accurate in its annotations compared to MTurk workers. We subset the data to only include those coded as having a frame of ‘economics’ or ‘health and safety,’ resulting in a sample size of \n$N=377$. We selected these two categories for their political salience and because they had the most observations in the data compared to other frames. Economics is often a salient issue for voters, particularly when assessing the effectiveness of government (De Vries and Giger, Reference De Vries and Giger2014; Hernández and Kriesi, Reference Hernández and Kriesi2016). In politics, voters and parties may have differing attitudes toward economic issues such as government intervention and taxation. While left-leaning individuals often advocate for increased government spending and regulation to address inequalities, right-leaning individuals focus on free-market principles and reduced government involvement (Haini and Wei Loon, Reference Haini and Loon2021). Similarly, health policy issues are embedded in political ideologies. For example, left-leaning individuals often advocate more for vaccine mandates whereas right-leaning individuals advocate for individual choice. On the topic of healthcare access, left-leaning ideologies view healthcare as a fundamental human right while right-leaning ideologies tend to favor market-driven approaches (Collins et al., Reference Collins, Abelson and Eyles2007; Peterson, Reference Peterson2011).\n\nWe use five languages in our tests, drawing on regional and linguistic variance. For abortion (text completion), we focus on data generated in Swedish, Polish and English. For Catalan independence, data are in Catalan and Spanish. Our goal with language selection is to match known political attitudes toward certain issues in particular societies to GPT output. In the case of abortion, it is linguistically constrained in the cases of Polish and Swedish, and geographically constrained to the US in the case of English. In the English-speaking world, abortion is a politically sensitive and divisive issue only in the US (Moon et al., Reference Moon, Thompson and Whiting2019), where public support for abortion is at 62%, one of the lowest among OECD countries. In contrast, 84% of the UK population supports abortion (Fetterlorf and Clancy, Reference Fetterlorf and Clancy2024). In Poland, society tends to be socially conservative and is one of the countries with the lowest level of public support for abortion (Fetterlorf and Clancy, Reference Fetterlorf and Clancy2024). In addition, Poland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe (Koralewska and Zielińska, Reference Koralewska and Zielińska2022). While there may be some influence from the Polish diaspora, its impact is likely minimal given its size and that much of the diaspora holds conservative views based on traditional values and religion (Pienkos, Reference Pienkos2024). Sweden, on the other hand, tends to be socially liberal and has one of the highest levels of public support for abortion in the world (Fetterlorf and Clancy, Reference Fetterlorf and Clancy2024). As for Catalan independence (text completion), language also maps well onto ideology. Within Catalonia, a majority of native Catalan speakers support it, while Spanish speakers do not (Llaneras, Reference Llaneras2017; Atienza-Barthelemy et al., Reference Atienza-Barthelemy, Martin-Gutierrez, Losada and Benito2019). In Spain, support for Catalan independence has always been below 15% (Atienza-Barthelemy et al., Reference Atienza-Barthelemy, Martin-Gutierrez, Losada and Benito2019). Because the issue of Catalan independence lacks political salience in Latin America, we expect most training data on this issue to come from Spanish speakers from Spain, and to be generally against Catalan independence.\n\nFor both economics and health (annotation), we use data in Polish and Swedish, translating the English tweets to these two languages using Google Translate. Both issues are politically salient and, similar to abortion, map well to political attitudes in both Poland and Sweden. For example, Poland’s economic policies are more conservative (Bluhm and Varga, Reference Bluhm and Varga2020), while Sweden’s economic policies are left-leaning, with a greater focus on social welfare (Andersson, Reference Andersson2022). These economic policies coincide with Sweden’s left-learning health policies focusing on the welfare state (Vallgårda, Reference Vallgårda2007), and Poland’s ‘conservative welfare state populism’ approach to health policy (Zabdyr-Jamróz et al., Reference Zabdyr-Jamróz, Löblová, Moise and Kowalska-Bobko2021). In sum, by examining how GPT-3.5 and -4 annotated texts in these languages, we can better understand how political attitudes and ideologies may be reflected in LLMs outputs on these topics.\n\nFirst, for the text completion task, using the official OpenAI API, we collect 500 independent responses per prompt per language from each GPT model, larger than the standard 100 responses of prior studies (Motoki et al., Reference Motoki, Neto and Rodrigues2024; Pit et al., Reference Pit, Ma, Conway, Chen, Bailey, Pit, Keo, Diep and Jiang2024). We ask the model to complete the sentence using the following abortion prompts: “A woman who has an abortion is” (English), “En kvinna som gör abort är det” (Swedish) and “Kobieta która dokonała aborcji jest” (Polish). For Catalan independence, the prompts are “La independència de Catalunya serà” in Catalan and “La independencia de Cataluña será” in Spanish (Translation: “The independence of Catalonia will be”).\n\nWe restart the model for each of the 500 requests. Obtaining a large sample of repeated responses allows us to model and estimate the average level of bias in the model with sufficient statistical power. This process results in samples of 3,000 observations for abortion and 2,000 for Catalan independence. This comes from a total of 6 prompts for abortion (3 languages and 2 models) and 4 for Catalan independence (2 languages and 2 models). We then use two coders to label all the responses manually. For abortion, the coders classify each GPT output as either pro-abortion or not, and for Catalan independence, as anti-independence or not. The focus is on the initial response of the model—for example, in one instance, GPT responded to “A woman who has an abortion is” with “who is in charge of her own body”—a pro-abortion response. This is in contrast to anti-abortion responses such as conservative responses replying “guilty of murder” and nonpartisan responses including “more than twice as likely to visit a doctor.” We code these latter two examples as not liberal. We follow the same approach with Catalan independence. Responses such as ‘illegal’ are coded as contrary to independence (1), while favorable texts like ‘the greatest victory’ or neutral ones such as ‘a long-standing issue’ are coded as 0. Our dependent variables, therefore, are binary.\n\nFor GPT-3.5, our coders identified 129 liberal and 371 non-liberal responses in English. The proportions changed significantly with GPT-4, which produced 448 liberal and 52 non-liberal responses in English. In Polish, answers were generally less liberal than both Swedish and English. GPT-3.5 yielded 109 liberal texts and 391 non-liberal ones in Polish, while the breakdown for GPT-4 was 161 and 339, respectively.Footnote 5 Results in Swedish, on the contrary, were more liberal. GPT-3.5 generated 147 liberal answers (35% more than in Polish) and 353 non-liberal ones. GPT-4 produced 213 liberal responses in Swedish (32.3% more than in Polish) and 287 non-liberal responses. For Catalan independence, Catalan responses were more favorable on the whole than those in Spanish. GPT-4 was also generally more favorable to Catalan independence than GPT-3.5.Footnote 6 In Catalan, GPT-3.5 produced 64 texts against independence and 336 either neutral or favorable to it. GPT-4 generated only 14 responses contrary to independence in Catalan. In Spanish, GPT-3 produced 169 responses against Catalan independence, three times more than in Catalan. GPT-4 generated 84 responses contrary to independence, six times more than in Catalan.Footnote 7 The task is not complex, so inter-coder reliability scores are high. The first author coded a random sample of 10% of the research assistant’s codes on abortion to ensure reliability. The intercoder reliability was .91 overall using the Holsti (Reference Holsti1969) method and ranged from .86 to 1 for each language and model dyad.\n\nSecond, for the annotation task, we use tweets on content moderation that are framed around two politically salient topics, economics and health (N=377). Overall, we had 217 tweets in the health and safety category and 160 in the economics category. We then translate the tweets to Swedish and Polish using Google Translate.Footnote 8 We then prompted Chat GPT-3.5 and -4 in Polish and Swedish accordingly with the prompt:Footnote 10 “Given the following tweet, classify it into one of the following categories. Tweet: {tweet}. ‘Extreme right,’ ‘right-wing,’ ‘center-right,’ ‘no bias,’ ‘center-left,’ ‘left,’ ‘extreme left.’Footnote 10 If the statement does not appear to refer specifically to the policies or opinions of a political party, or if neither label seems to fit, return ‘no bias.”’Footnote 11\n\nWe use a multilevel model (MLM) to estimate GPT bias. A MLM is an ideal fit because our data is structured hierarchically and varies at multiple nested levels—text and GPT model. MLMs allow us to leverage variation across these multiple, nested levels to model changes in a lower-level outcome variable, all while allowing for residual components at each level in the hierarchy (Gelman, Reference Gelman2006; Stegmueller, Reference Stegmueller2013). That is, we analyze the ideology of a GPT response, a characteristic of the GPT text (lower level), across model types (higher level). Not modeling the hierarchical nature of the data explicitly (for instance, using multinomial logistic regression instead) might yield erroneous standard errors and inflate or underestimate the significance of the results. Also, we are interested not just in variation at the text level, but in how the ideology of a text varies by language and model version. In multilevel modeling, random effects help capture and estimate group-level heterogeneity, enhancing our analysis (Gelman, Reference Gelman2006; Hazlett and Wainstein, Reference Hazlett and Wainstein2022).\n\nThe MLM setup can be written as\n\nwhere \n$Y$ is a categorical outcome variable, \n$X$ is a vector of text-level predictors and \n$Z$ is a vector of group level covariates. \n$\\beta$ is the coefficient for text-level regressor \n$X_{ij}$, while \n$\\gamma$ captures group level effects (model type). \n$\\gamma_0$ is the overall model-level intercept (the fixed effect), while \n$\\gamma_j$ captures the effect of \n$Z_j$. \n$\\mu_j$ and \n$\\epsilon_{ij}$ are the error terms at the group and text levels, respectively. Using the logit-link function as our outcome, we can build our specific MLM:\n\nwhere \n$j$ is the model type (GPT-3.5 and -4). In this model, each language’s intercepts and slopes vary across GPT models. This is important because we expect the outcome to vary across languages depending on the model used to produce the text (see Gordillo, TimonedaTimoneda and Vallejo Vera, forthcoming; Timoneda and Vallejo Vera, Reference Timoneda and Vallejo Vera2025a, Reference Timoneda and Vallejo Vera2025b). Adding a random effect coefficient to the variable ‘language’ at the group level (\n$\\gamma_j$) produces a parameter for each language and model group. We can then use this coefficient to understand the effect of language on the probability of observing a liberal GPT response for each model group. As our dependent variables are dichotomous, we employ a binary logistic MLM, which we fit using glmer() in R.\n\nTable 1 displays the results of our two MLM for abortion and Catalan independence. The models show the fixed effects (FE) of the overall model for the language coefficients and random effects (RE) terms by GPT model. We also report the standard errors and significance levels. The reference category is Polish for the abortion models and Spanish for the Catalan independence models. For abortion (model 1), the FE terms indicate that Swedish is significantly more likely than Polish to have liberal responses, confirming our first hypothesis. When compared to English, the difference is not statistically significant but the sign is positive. As for the RE terms, we see that the slope for Swedish is positive and statistically significant, with an overall difference of 0.573 (this results from adding the FE with each RE, and calculating the difference). Similarly, for Catalan independence, GPT output is more anti-independence in Spanish than in Catalan, as indicated by the statistically significant FE term. The RE terms show that the differences persist across GPT-3.5 and -4 and that the slope is negative (see Figure 2 for a graphical representation of these results).\n\nNote: ** \n$p\\leq0.001$, * \n$p\\leq0.01$, \n$^{+}$ \n$p\\leq0.05$ Multilevel analysis of GPT bias for abortion (1) and Catalan independence (2). The reference category in (1) is Polish and (2) is Spanish. The outcomes are (1) the likelihood of observing a liberal response and (2) the likelihood of observing an anti-independence response.\n\nFigure 1 confirms the strong substantive significance of the results in the abortion model in Table 1. Plot (a) shows the comparison between Swedish and Polish, while (b) plots the results for English. The coefficients have been converted to the predicted probability of observing a liberal GPT response (\n$y$-axis). There are two dimensions to these results. First is the stark differences across languages, especially concerning Polish and Swedish. In GPT-3.5, the probability of a liberal text is 0.434 in Polish and 0.534 in Swedish. That is, GPT-3.5 is 23% more likely to produce a liberal text in Swedish than Polish. Qualitatively, it is more common in Swedish text to see responses stating that a woman who has an abortion is “allowed to choose” or “in control of her body and health.” Conversely, in Polish, it is more common to see strong value judgments such as “murderer,” “doomed,” “a criminal,” “a monster,” or “guilty.” In GPT-4, the intercepts shift up but the differences across the two languages remain similar. The probability of a liberal output jumps to 0.566 in Polish (more liberal than Swedish in GPT-3.5), and 0.670 in Swedish—a difference of 18.3% between the two languages in GPT-4. Importantly, both languages are significantly more liberal in GPT-4 than 3.5: Swedish’s probability increases from 0.534 to 0.670, or 25.5%, while Polish’s goes up by 13.2 percentage points, or 30.4%. As for English (plot b), the probability of a liberal output is 0.49 in GPT-3.5. This score is between Polish and Swedish, which matches our expectations because the models’ outputs reflect that US society, where most training data come from, is more liberal than Poland but more conservative than Sweden in terms of attitudes toward abortion. In GPT-4, however, the output is consistently liberal: the model will produce a pro-choice text 95.9% of the time, a 95.7% change between the two models.\n\nFigure 2 shows the results for Catalan independence. The probability that GPT-3.5 produces text that reflects a negative view of Catalan independence is only 31.08% in Catalan and almost double in Spanish at 61.15%. Qualitative evidence from the data supports this. While Catalan text commonly states that independence will be ‘a success,’ ‘the greatest victory,’ ‘the solution to all problems,’ or ‘inevitable,’ Spanish text is much more contrarian, often claiming that Catalan independence will be ‘a failure,’ ‘an abject fiasco,’ ‘a catastrophe,’ ‘illegal’ or ‘economic suicide.’ The word ‘illegal,’ for example, is the first word in 20 GPT-3.5 responses in Spanish while it does not appear at all in Catalan. As for GPT-4, the differences across languages remain but the intercept shifts down, making all responses across languages more neutral and accepting of Catalan independence. The probability of an anti-independence text in Spanish is 38.98%, a 36% drop. In Catalan, only 8.5% of all responses are contrary to independence—72.65% less than in GPT-3.5. Qualitatively, all GPT-4 answers are more subdued, with contrarian answers mostly stating that Catalan independence will be decided exclusively by the Spanish government, an idea aligned with more extreme Spanish nationalist views that deny a voice to Catalan people to decide their own future. Out of 500 GPT-4 responses in Spanish, 84 state that the decision on Catalan independence rests solely on the Spanish government, while none of the Catalan responses do.\n\nThese results provide strong evidence for our two hypotheses. First, ideological biases in the training data condition the ideology of the output. Swedish output is consistently more pro-choice than Polish text, regardless of the model and despite the algorithm’s filters. Similarly, Catalan text is significantly more accepting of and positive about the independence of Catalonia than Spanish text. These findings across languages strongly support the thesis that social norms and beliefs among the people who produced the data will be reflected in GPT output. Second, OpenAI’s filters remove some biases but induce new ones in each language and issue. GPT-4, which is heavily filtered, produces more liberal text across the board in terms of abortion in Swedish, Polish and English. The results are particularly strong in the case of English, which has been the focus of a majority of OpenAI’s filtering attention. GPT-4 is almost exclusively pro-choice. GPT-4 is also more accepting of Catalan independence, producing almost no value judgments about independence outcomes, focusing solely on where sovereignty resides. Sometimes it states that Catalan independence should be decided exclusively by the Spanish government (a contrarian view), while it more often states that it should be decided by the Catalan people (an accepting view). Overall, however, GPT-4 induces a greater pro-independence bias based on ideas of democracy and sovereignty of the people.\n\nTable 2 displays the results of three MLM for economics, health, and both topics combined. The models report the FE of the overall model for Swedish and RE terms by GPT model. As with Table 1, we also report standard errors and significance levels, and the reference category is Polish for all three models. The FE terms in all models show that Swedish is more likely than Polish to produce a liberal response, which matches the results from the text generation test. The results are significant at the 0.001 level for all models. As for the RE terms, we see that the slope for Swedish is negative and statistically significant, with an overall difference of \n$-$0.586 (see Figures 3 through 5 for a graphical representation of these results).\n\nNote: ** \n$p\\leq0.001$, * \n$p\\leq0.01$, \n$^{+}$ \n$p\\leq0.05$ Multilevel analysis of GPT bias for economics, health and both combined. The reference category is Polish. The outcome is the likelihood of observing a liberal (left-leaning) response.\n\nFigure 3 confirms the results from Table 2 and shows the substantive significance of the differences across languages and models in economic issues and health policy. Plot (a) displays the results for economic issues when comparing GPT annotations between Swedish and Polish. Plot (b) plots shows the results for health while plot (c) shows the results for the combined data with both economic issues and health policy. As with Figure 1, the coefficients reflect the predicted probability of observing a liberal (left-leaning) GPT response—the y-axis. There are two key takeaways from these results. First, as with the text generation task, there are significant differences across Polish and Swedish in all models and topics. The probability of observing a liberal response by GPT (3.5 and 4) is consistently higher in Swedish than in Polish. In economic issues (plot (a)), the probability of a liberal text is 0.588 in Polish and 0.796 in Swedish with GPT-3.5, a difference of 20.8 percentage points or 35.3%. For GPT-4, the difference is 27.6 points and 66.8% (0.689 for Swedish and 0.413 for Polish). In plot (b), the differences in GPT health-related responses are equally stark. GPT-3.5 responses are 30.7% more likely to be liberal in Swedish than in Polish,Footnote 12 while GPT-4 output is twice as likely to be liberal in Swedish than in Polish.Footnote 13 Lastly, the results in plot (c) where data for both issues is combined are consistent with the first two plots.Footnote 14 Therefore, the results with our language-based design show that ideological bias is significant across different LLM tasks such as text generation and annotation. The second key takeaway from these results is that GPT-4, on average, produces less liberal responses in both languages. Thus, similar to the text generation exercise, the means for GPT-4 shift even though differences across languages remain. In this case, because both topics are ideological in the left–right spectrum but are not sensitive as abortion is, the filters do not induce liberal bias. This could partially be due to differences in how Western versus Eastern Europe thinks about ideology on health policy and economics. For example, while Poland is considered more ‘conservative’ economically by the West for not following neoliberal ideals, in some instances it may be seen as more left-leaning following its historical ties to communist state-ownership of the means of production. In terms of health, the ideological difference is not quite as stark as in abortion. Poland leans conservative in some ways in regard to health policy, particularly in how it views what is socially acceptable in health, while it is less conservative when it comes to healthcare access.\n\nWe introduce a novel method to identify bias in generative AI models such as GPT-3.5 and -4, and provide strong evidence that biases stem both from the training data as well as filtering algorithms. Our method leverages linguistic differences across multiple countries and regions to match known social values to GPT output. Using multilevel modeling, we identify two types of bias, training and algorithmic bias. First, there is a large amount of bias that stems directly from the training data and which is consistent across both GPT-3.5 and -4. In our text generation task, we show that GPT abortion output in Swedish is significantly more liberal than in Polish, matching the two country’s known attitudes toward the issue. Both languages are largely constrained to their specific countries, making it possible for us to draw comparisons between the ideological values in those countries and the GPT output. As for Catalan independence, Catalan responses are consistently more pro-independence, while Spanish output is more often against the idea of independence. The results match known data that Catalan speakers are more pro-independence than Spanish speakers. The results from our annotation task confirm these findings, as GPT output (both in 3.5 in 4) is consistently more liberal than in Polish in issues like the economy or health policy. A major contribution of our annotation task is new evidence that ideological biases can exist across tasks, as our annotation findings are consistent with those in the text generation task.\n\nSecond, we find that OpenAI’s filtering induces liberal, pro-choice biases in GPT-4 responses in our text generation task with two politically sensitive topics. Across all languages, abortion responses are more liberal in GPT-4 than GPT-3.5. For Polish and Swedish (see Figure 1), GPT-4 responses are 30.4% and 25.5% more liberal, respectively. For English, they are 94% more liberal, and GPT-4 produces liberal text 95.9% of the time. The difference can only be attributed to OpenAI’s filtering methods, which consistently produce pro-choice text with little variation between the different draws. A similar pattern emerges with Catalan independence. In GPT-4, both Catalan and Spanish texts are significantly less likely to include vitriolic, negative responses about whether it is right or wrong for Catalonia to have its own state. Neither state that independence would be ‘illegal,’ ‘a catastrophe,’ or ‘an abject fiasco.’ Rather than taking sides in the debate, both GPT-4 models focus on the right of the Catalan people to decide Catalonia’s future and are more likely to favor a democratic referendum in Catalonia. The main differences lay in Spanish GPT-4 stating around 17% of the time that Catalan independence is solely the prerogative of the central Spanish government, not the Catalan people. The rest of the responses in Spanish GPT-4 indicated some level of support for the idea that the Catalan people should decide their own future. Therefore, both GPT-4 models are much more liberal and pro-choice. In the case of abortion, they focus mostly on a woman’s right to decide over her own reproductive health. As for Catalan independence, GPT-4’s output is supportive of the idea that the decision over independence rests with the Catalan people in a referendum. We believe these results show the presence of algorithmic bias introduced by extensive filtering. Through reinforcement learning, OpenAI filters GPT-4 models to produce text output that is less likely to take sides, make bold judgments, and include socially unacceptable language about social groups, minorities, etc. On these two sensitive topics, GPT-4’s algorithm shied away from value judgments about the correctness of abortion or Catalan independence and instead made both a matter of individual and collective choice. GPT-3.5, in the absence of extensive filtering, produced much more resolute, aggressive and judgmental answers.\n\nThe contributions of this work are many. First, we develop an original method to identify training bias in generative models. Second, we distinguish between training and algorithmic bias and provide evidence that both are present in GPT-4. Third, this article is, to the authors’ knowledge, the first to compare bias across model versions from within the same developer. This is especially relevant considering that models evolve over time and that each new version addresses biases differently. Fourth, our design compares text generation and annotation tasks to see the extent to which biases in one LLM task may imply biases in another. We find that they can, as we see major differences across both languages and models in both types of tasks. Lastly, our work has major implications for the politics of AI. We find that post-training bias-correction methods introduce algorithmic bias and do not fully address the underlying training bias. Most concerning is that these approaches, in fact, introduce new biases. Our analysis is therefore relevant to other generative AI models that exist (like GPT-4o) or will be developed in the future, as we show that some biases in the training data are likely to persist through filtering, which is in turn likely to introduce new biases into the model output.\n\nThe supplementary material for this article can be found at https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10057.

We also thank the participants at our APSA 2024 panel, especially Jacob Montgomery and Alexis Palmer, as well as attendees of the Nuffield College Political Science Seminar Series. We are deeply grateful to Nicole Kreimer for her exceptional work as our research assistant.\n\nThe labeled data generated from GPT-3.5 and -4 and the replication code are available at https://github.com/joantimoneda/PSRM_GPT_bias\n\n1 Text generation includes tasks that ask GPT to create text, such as summarization or question-answering. LLMs can also be used for annotation tasks in research, such as sentiment analysis and other forms of text classification.\n\n2 One of our key assumptions is that the training data will tend to reflect, on average, the majority positions of a given population. We think that the model, on average, will produce answers that reflect the full extent of the training data. It is unlikely that the model will consistently draw from very specific subsets of the training data to produce answers. It might do so for a smaller subset of draws, but it will not do so consistently. With repeated sampling, as we do in the article, we should observe the average response from the broader set of texts used during training. Then, as the model filters responses through reinforcement learning, we should observe changes in the output as a result of those filters. The fact that our results match known attitudes toward politically sensitive issues in specific societies lends further credence to this assumption.\n\n3 Here, having a liberal bias means an over-representation of more pro-abortion responses, i.e. more progressive answers. On the issue of abortion, therefore, we use the word ‘liberal’ to refer to progressive positions as is common in U.S. political context.\n\n4 According to the authors, the ‘health’ category includes text on: “Health care access and effectiveness, illness, disease, sanitation, obesity, mental health effects, prevention of or perpetuation of gun violence, infrastructure and building safety.” The ‘economics’ category includes: “The costs, benefits, or monetary/financial implications of the issue (to an individual, family, community, or to the economy as a whole).”\n\n5 The majority of the non-liberal responses are much more neutral in GPT-4 than GPT-3.5.\n\n6 There are no duplicated answers from GPT-3 in any of the models. GPT-4 produced no repeated responses in the abortion case but did so in the Catalan independence case. Specifically, GPT-4 generated 276 repeated answers in Catalan and 357 in Spanish. We do not consider the repetition in this subset of our data to be problematic for our overall modeling approach and results because the results are consistent with the other subsamples unaffected by this issue. However, we think scholars should be aware that GPT-4 can produce repeated answers, especially if they are short, which can be a problem in downstream analysis if it occurs systematically in a researcher’s data.\n\n7 For each of these last three categories, the number of texts neutral or favorable to independence is 486, 331 and 416, respectively.\n\n8 While translation could introduce bias if wording choices differ between languages, we do not expect this to be a significant concern given that tweets are very short, leaving little room for translation differences to systematically affect our results.\n\n9 We prompted in Swedish: “Med tanke på följande kvittra, klassificera tweeten i en av kategorierna. Kvittra: {tweet} ‘vänsterextrem,’ ‘mitten-vänster,’ ‘vänster,’ ‘ingen partiskhet,’ ‘höger,’ ‘mitten-höger’ eller ‘högerextrem.’ Om påståendet inte verkar hänvisa specifikt till ett politiskt partis politik eller åsikter, eller om ingen av etiketterna verkar passa, svara ‘ingen partiskhet”’ for the Swedish language text and Polish for the polish language text: “Biorąc pod uwagę poniższy ćwiergotanie, zaklasyfikuj go do jednej z kategorii. Ćwiergotanie: {tweet} ‘skrajnie prawicowy,’‘prawicowy,’ ‘centroprawicowy,’ ‘bez stronniczości’ ‘centrolewicowy,’ ‘lewicowy,’ ‘skrajnie lewicowy.’ Jeśli stwierdzenie nie wydaje się odnosić konkretnie do polityki lub opinii partii politycznej lub jeśli żadna z etykiet nie wydaje się pasować, zwróć ‘brak uprzedzeń.”’ Our prompt partially drew from an article using ChatGPT to analyze tweets (Ibrahim et al., Reference Ibrahim, Khan, Alabdouli, Almatrooshi, Nguyen, Rahwan and Zaki2024).\n\n10 We again make this outcome binary for our multi-level model, dichotomizing these categories as either liberal response (left, center-left, or extreme-left) or not. See the next section \n\n11 We do not provide explicit definitions of what constitutes the political left or right in our prompts. This approach allows us to capture the models’ implicit biases by observing how they naturally classify political content without external conditioning.\n\n12 The probability is 0.830 for Swedish and 0.635 for Polish.\n\n13 The probability is 0.737 for Swedish and 0.367 for Polish, a 100.8% increase.\n\n14 In plot (c), the probability of a liberal response in Swedish with GPT-3.5 is 0.818. It is 0.621 in Polish. The difference is 19.7 percentage points and 31.7%. For GPT-4, the respective probabilities are 0.715 in Swedish and 0.380 in Polish, for a difference of 33.5 percentage points and 88.2%.",

    "description": "Russia disclosed several new figures on Wednesday, including how much it's specifically spent on the war and how many soldiers it hired in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Russia's defense ministry broadcast its wide-ranging annual review on Wednesday of the Ukraine war, providing clues about its military goals and performance this year.\n\nAndrei Belousov, the Russian defense minister, presented the official statistics during the Defense Ministry Board's expanded meeting in Moscow.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the defense ministry's claims, which often differ significantly from those of international observers. Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, said at the meeting that the Kremlin's troops were \"crushing\" Ukraine, despite the war dragging on for nearly four years.\n\nThe disclosures also come as Russia has sought to project strength and demanded heavy concessions from Ukraine while negotiating potential peace terms with the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, Belousov's presentation offers insight into Russia's ambitions for the war and its official narratives surrounding how it fights and plans to fight next year. Several new official figures were also announced.\n\nHere are 10 highlights from Belousov's end-of-year review.\n\nBelousov said that Russia's war spending is on track to reach about 5.1% of the country's GDP in 2025, out of an overall defense budget that reaches 7.3% of its annual GDP.\n\nThe country's nominal GDP in 2024 was about 201.2 trillion rubles, and is expected to grow 1% this year to about 203 trillion rubles, or $2.52 trillion.\n\nRussian independent media, however, reported that the economic ministry has forecast a GDP of about $2.7 trillion for the year.\n\nA war budget of 5.1% would therefore be somewhere between $128 billion and $137.7 billion.\n\nThis is the first time Russia has publicly disclosed the amount that it spends specifically on the war. Previously, the Kremlin only announced figures for total defense spending.\n\nThe US, by comparison, is planning to spend $901 billion on its military, or about 3.4% of its GDP.\n\nBelousov said that his ministry delivered roughly 38,000 motorcycles, buggies, and all-terrain vehicles to its troops on the front lines in 2025.\n\n\"This is 10 times more than last year,\" he said, adding that Russia plans to reach \"full strength\" in these vehicles next year.\n\nRussian troops have increasingly been using motorcycles, quad bikes, and other small, unarmored vehicles to assault or approach Ukrainian positions, trying to use their speed and small size to avoid drone attacks.\n\nUkrainians have also adopted the tactic, with one regiment even establishing an official motorcycle attack company in May.\n\nBelousov said that Russia hired 409,611 new contract soldiers in 2025, down from 449,243 in 2024.\n\nHowever, that already exceeds the Kremlin's 403,000 person recruitment goal for the year.\n\n\"Nearly two-thirds of them were young men under 40,\" Belousov said of the new recruits. \"More than a third have higher or specialized secondary education.\"\n\nUkraine and Russia have both been hard-pressed to fill their ranks as Moscow pressures Kyiv's forces with a continuous grind of frontal infantry assaults.\n\nTo maintain its flow of troops, Russia often entices recruits with hefty sign-on bonuses or pardons for crimes committed in the country.\n\nBelousov said that about 50% of Ukrainian casualties from Russian attacks come from first-person-view drones, or FPV drones. These are the small quadcopters mounted with explosives that have become a hallmark of the war.\n\nIn the summer, Russia said that it was outproducing Ukraine on FPV drones, though Kyiv's officials have since said their country has caught back up.\n\nUkrainian leaders have said that 70% of all casualties inflicted during the war involved FPV drones.\n\nBelousov said that Russia plans to create a new drone formation called the Unmanned Systems Forces next year, which would train \"tens of thousands\" of people.\n\nRussia has already created an official drone unit called Rubicon, which was formed last August to prioritize fighting with FPV drones and has often been described as fielding its most elite pilots.\n\nNow, Moscow appears to be trying to make such warfare an official pillar of its fighting force.\n\nBelousov said the Kremlin needed to transition FPV drone attacks from individual tasks carried out by each unit to \"integrated joint operations\" among its forces.\n\nUkraine launched its own Unmanned Systems Forces last year, appointing the previous commander of the elite unit, Magyar Birds, as its leader.\n\nRoughly 27,400 Ukrainian long-range drones were intercepted this year over Russian territory, with the bulk appearing after the summer, Belousov said.\n\nBelousov said that Ukraine initially began sending about 1,000 drones a month into Russia, but that the monthly number began hitting 3,700 by May.\n\nThe defense minister claimed that Russia's interception rate \"averages 97%\" for the year.\n\nUkraine has typically used fixed-wing drones to attack deeper into Russia, targeting what it says are oil and gas facilities and military production sites.\n\nUkrainian kamikaze \"drones\" aka converted Ukrainian-produced Aeroprakt A-22 Foxbat light aircraft.\n\nThese drones can reportedly deliver 300kg warheads at a range around 2000 - 3000 km.\n\nIt's believed that similar drones were recently used to hit a Shahed drone manufacturing… pic.twitter.com/8xw6BzoZvO\n\nNotably, Belousov mentioned that Russia has also been exploring FPV drones that can serve as high-speed interceptors, a technology that Ukraine has been refining to counter Moscow's Shahed waves.\n\nBelousov said that Russia received two Tu-160Ms, which are modernized, supersonic bombers that can deploy nuclear weapons or powerful stealth missiles.\n\nThat's a clue about the production rate of the bombers, which are part of a small fleet that forms a vital pillar of Russia's nuclear triad. Several of Russia's older bombers were reported severely damaged in Operation Spiderweb, an audacious Ukrainian drone attack in early June that targeted a fleet of about 41 warplanes.\n\nUkrainian sources claimed that several Tu-160s were also hit, although this was not confirmed by independent open-source intelligence at the time.\n\nRussia's military also appears to be modifying its organizational structure.\n\nBelousov said that the Kremlin had created five new divisions, 13 new brigades, and 30 new regiments in 2025. International think tanks estimate that Russian divisions can consist of between 10,000 and 20,000 troops, while regiments within typically have about 2,000 soldiers and are further split into battalions.\n\nBrigades, which typically exist as a separate formation, often have about 3,500 to 4,500 troops.\n\nBelousov said this new structure included a new division, called the Aerospace Forces, which has a regiment \"equipped with the unique S-500 antiaircraft missile system, capable of striking targets in near space.\"\n\nNext year, the Kremlin plans to add four more divisions, 14 brigades, and 39 new regiments, he added.\n\nSome of these figures encompass formations that Russia has transformed, so they aren't necessarily an indicator of how widely Russia is expanding its military organization structure. For example, Belousov said two marine brigades were turned into a single division.\n\nBelousov said that Russia had expanded its use of drones and all-terrain vehicles to deliver gear from a \"one-time operation\" in 2024 to carrying 12,000 tons of cargo this year to the front lines.\n\n\"By 2026, this figure must be at least doubled,\" he said.\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have been developing uncrewed ground vehicles, or ground-based drones, that can be remotely operated to deliver supplies to the front line or even conduct assaults.\n\nThe emerging technology is especially useful for dangerous tasks that would otherwise have to be filled by a human soldier.\n\nSome military units have also reported using drones to deliver equipment by air, such as one Ukrainian commander who said his forces used drones to send an e-bike to a stranded soldier.\n\nBelousov's presentation made it clear that Russia has been conducting precision strikes against Ukraine's power facilities.\n\nMore than 70% of Ukraine's thermal power plants and 37% of its hydroelectric plants have been disabled, Belousov said.\n\n\"The effectiveness of Russian precision strikes is about 60%, which is an order of magnitude higher than the effectiveness of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory,\" Belousov said.\n\n\"Ukraine's energy capacity has been reduced by more than half,\" he added.\n\nAttacking energy infrastructure is a war crime if it's found to be intentionally carried out to cause harm to civilians. Ukraine's besieged power grid is especially crucial, as it's essential for keeping its citizens warm during harsh winters.\n\nBelousov said the strikes on energy facilities were targeting the Ukrainian military, and that disabling the grid cut off power to Kyiv's forces.\n\nHowever, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said last September that Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid were found to be severely affecting civilians and had \"disproportionately impacted\" vulnerable groups.\n\nUkraine also carries out attacks on Russian oil and gas facilities, though it said its aim is to cripple Moscow's ability to export energy and sustain war production.",

    "fullText": "China's deepening property crisis has crushed household wealth and dented the fortunes of some of its biggest tycoons — but a new class of AI-era billionaires is rising fast.\n\nThis year, the standout winners are coming from China's red-hot AI chip sector.\n\nOn Wednesday, shares of MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai — a GPU startup founded by former AMD executives — skyrocketed as much as 755% on their first day of trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's tech-focused STAR Market, before closing up about 700%.\n\nThe surge catapulted its chairman and cofounder, Chen Weiliang, into one of China's fastest-rising tech moguls. Chen's stake in MetaX is worth about $6.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nOther early insiders also saw eye-popping paper gains.\n\nMetaX's other two cofounders and co-chief technology officers, Peng Li and Yang Jian, hold stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the blockbuster debut, according to Bloomberg's calculations.\n\nChen's rise follows that of another GPU entrepreneur, Zhang Jianzhong, the founder and CEO of Moore Threads Technology.\n\nEarlier this month, Zhang's net worth jumped to $4.3 billion after his company's successful IPO, continuing a wave of investor enthusiasm for homegrown semiconductor players.\n\nThe richest figure in China's AI chip scene is Chen Tianshi, a cofounder and CEO of Cambricon Technologies — a company retail traders have dubbed \"China's Nvidia.\"\n\nCambricon's Chen is now worth $22.5 billion, making him the country's 16th-richest individual on Bloomberg's list. He is the 115th richest person in the world.\n\nThese new fortunes reflect a sharp shift in investor sentiment.\n\nChinese AI and semiconductor stocks have been on a tear since the breakout of the China-made DeepSeek-R1 AI model released in January. The model helped spark a rally in local tech names and pushed the Hang Seng Tech Index up more than 20% so far this year.\n\nWashington's tightening export controls on advanced Nvidia chips also contributed to the boom.\n\nSuch restrictions on high-end AI processors have choked China's access to cutting-edge US hardware and pushed Beijing to lean harder on domestic suppliers.\n\nStill, China's new AI billionaires remain far from the top of the country's wealth rankings. The upper tier is still dominated by long-established tycoons.\n\nIn the top spot is Zhong Shanshan, the low-key bottled-water magnate behind Nongfu Spring, with a fortune of $68.1 billion, per Bloomberg.\n\nPony Ma, a cofounder and CEO of Tencent, ranks second with $66.5 billion — a fortune up 38% this year, on the heels of Tencent's AI-induced rally — while ByteDance cofounder Zhang Yiming comes in third with $65.2 billion.",

    "description": "The triangle-shaped \"blended-wing body\" plane ditches the traditional tube-and-wing design for one giant, sweeping wing with the cabin built inside.",
    "fullText": "Another airline is placing bets on the radical \"flying wing\" plane that industry professionals foresee as the future of commercial aviation.\n\nCalifornia startup Natilus announced Wednesday that Indian carrier SpiceJet will order up to 100 of its new airliner called Horizon. The triangle-shaped \"blended-wing body\" (BWB) aircraft ditches the traditional tube-and-wing design for one giant, sweeping wing with the cabin built inside.\n\nIt's a more efficient aircraft that allows for more space and fewer emissions. Natilus hopes to launch Horizon in the early 2030s.\n\nCompany CEO Aleksey Matyushev said in a press release that India's growing aviation sector will be short about 2,200 aircraft by 2040 and believes his next-generation BWB could help fill that demand.\n\nIndia is the world's fifth-largest aviation market with about 211 million passengers in 2024 — an increase of about 11% year-over-year, according to the global airline trade association IATA.\n\nSpiceJet said it will help Natilus navigate India's regulatory process, with the order contingent on the Horizon ultimately being certified in the country. Natilus also plans to source manufactured parts from India and has established a subsidiary called Natilus India, headquartered in Mumbai, to support its operations.\n\nThis is the first publicly announced international airline order for Horizon, but Natilus told Business Insider that its commercial order book — which also includes its BWB cargo version, Kona — stands at more than 570 orders valued at $25 billion following SpiceJet's order.\n\nKona has purchase agreements with carriers like US operator Ameriflight, a partner of FedEx, DHL, and UPS, as well as Canadian airline Norolinor. However, it's unclear if Horizon has other buyers besides SpiceJet.\n\nHorizon would bring a new type of aircraft to India's skies that promises better operating economics than those offered by the reigning Boeing-Airbus duopoly.\n\nMatyushev previously told Business Insider that Horizon will offer improved efficiency because its wing design generates lift across a much larger surface area, cutting fuel burn by roughly 30% and operating costs by about 50% compared with similarly sized aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320.\n\nThe plane, which could carry up to 240 people in a high-capacity configuration, would also fit into existing airport infrastructure and offer about 40% more cabin space thanks to its wider footprint.\n\nMatyushev said this could translate into unique spaces that today's jets can't fit, like a lounge or a kids' playroom.\n\nRenderings of Horizon published in July show a futuristic business class, up to three aisles between rows of a dozen economy seats, and dedicated privacy pods.\n\nAirbus CEO Guillaume Faury recently said that it sees BWB planes as the future of aviation. But he said the jet may be windowless due to the curved structure. This means passengers could face minimal natural light, disorientation, and claustrophobia.\n\nThe wider cabin also poses additional safety challenges during emergency evacuations since those in the very center would be further from the exit doors than on today's aircraft, and the passengers and crew wouldn't be able to see the situation outside.\n\nMatyushev confirmed to Business Insider that Horizon would have windows, but for those in the middle of the plane, it is also designing skylights and other lighting strategies to mimic the outside.\n\nHe has previously said Horizon would meet and exceed safety standards.\n\nThe BWB concept is not new. It has long been used by the US military — among the most famous being the Northrop B-2 Spirit stealth bomber — and passenger variants have been studied by innovators like Airbus, NASA, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing for decades.\n\nSub-scale demonstrators have flown, but no full-sized BWB has been certified for commercial use.\n\nWith a team of employees who have worked for companies like Northrop Grumman and SpaceX, Natilus is betting Horizon can break into the fiercely competitive commercial aircraft market. But it's not the only player chasing that goal.\n\nAirbus has been experimenting with commercial BWB aircraft since 2017 as part of its ZEROe program, which aims to build zero-emission airliners that run on hydrogen instead of traditional jet fuel. That project flew a demonstrator in 2019 but has since been delayed at least a decade from its initial 2035 timeline.\n\nAnother California startup, JetZero, is developing a 250-person BWB, called the \"Z4,\" that is expected to launch in the early 2030s and offer up to 50% lower fuel burn. It could replace jets like the Boeing 767 or the Airbus A330.\n\nUnited Airlines' venture capital arm, United Airlines Ventures, plans to order up to 200 Z4s. Managing director Andrew Chang previously described JetZero to Business Insider as a \"living room in the sky.\"\n\n\"Everything around the customer travel experience — how they sit in the plane, board, and deplane, and how [crewmembers] serve them — can be reinvented around the new space within this new aircraft design,\" he said.",

    "title": "Starbucks is doubling down on its free bachelor's degree program as enrollment surges 60%",
    "description": "Starbucks' Chief People Officer Sara Kelly spoke to Business Insider about the company's increasingly popular free college program.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks receives more than a million job applications a year, the company's Chief People Officer says one reason is a quietly powerful lure: the promise of a fully-funded bachelor's degree from Arizona State University.\n\nFor Brea Yancey, a barista in Washington state who has worked at the company for eight years, that benefit hasn't just reshaped her future — it reshaped her family's. She enrolled, then inspired her mother, a Starbucks store manager, to join her, turning a workplace perk into a two-generation push toward a goal neither woman thought was financially in reach.\n\n\"I didn't think college was going to be an option because of how much it costs with loans and things like that,\" Yancey, who celebrated her graduation on Monday, told Business Insider. \"I know it's going to make all the difference in the world not having to worry about that.\"\n\nYancey pursued a degree in interdisciplinary arts and performance, with the goal of becoming a music teacher. Her mother graduated last semester with a degree in interdisciplinary studies, concentrating in sales, marketing, and project management.\n\n\"I'm glad that she got to finish school, because that's all she ever wanted, and she stopped originally because she got pregnant with me, but now we finished it together,\" Yancey said.\n\nAs college costs have soared, so has enrollment in Starbucks' College Achievement Plan (SCAP) program, Chief People Officer Sara Kelly told Business Insider. The program, which began in 2014, offers eligible employees 100% upfront tuition coverage for their first bachelor's degree, facilitated through online classes at ASU.\n\n\"Over the last five years, we've seen a 60% increase in participation,\" Kelly said. \"We have 13% of our partners participating as scholars today.\"\n\nThat represents at least one enrolled Starbucks staff member at about 90% of its coffeehouses, Kelly added.\n\nStarbucks isn't the only retail or Fortune 500 employer offering education benefits. Amazon, Walmart, and Chipotle also offer similar programs. However, compared to most programs in the US retail sector, Starbucks doesn't require reimbursement of tuition payments or require students to stay with the company for a certain amount of time after graduation.\n\nYounger students are increasingly questioning the value of a college degree. A May 2024 Deloitte survey found that a third of Gen Z and millennials chose to skip higher education due to rising costs, and the average price of attendance for a student living on campus at an in-state public 4-year institution is $108,584 over 4 years, according to Educationdata — so you can't beat free.\n\n\"This started over 10 years ago, all in service of creating access to education, and the importance of creating access to education,\" Kelly said. \"College is incredibly costly, and so how do we create access to that education for all of our partners? So we're really proud, because we see this as one of the most powerful expressions of our investment in our partners.\"\n\nStarbucks has expanded the SCAP program in recent years, offering access to more than 150 degree pathways, providing enrolled students with a broader range of fields to pursue than in the program's early years. They've also added a \"Pathway to Admission\" support route for partners who don't initially qualify for university admission, allowing them to take preparatory courses and earn their way into ASU. Additionally, a \"plus-one\" benefit is available for eligible military and veteran partners, extending SCAP to a qualifying family member.\n\nThis year, Starbucks introduced new study abroad and coffee education opportunities, offering a hands-on sustainability immersion at Hacienda Alsacia in Costa Rica, where scholars study climate, agronomy, and the future of coffee at their global research and development farm.\n\nOf course, the students aren't the only ones benefiting. The program is a significant retention win for Starbucks. Turnover is at record lows, Kelly said, and baristas who have spoken to Business Insider frequently cite the SCAP program as a reason they've stayed with the company.\n\nThe program also helps to strengthen Starbucks' talent pipeline, as the company has committed to a 90% internal hire rate or fill rate for its retail leadership roles.\n\n\"Our Starbucks college achievement plan partners are part of our pipeline for those management roles, and we're very excited about that,\" Kelly said. \"But do they have to stay with Starbucks? No.\"\n\nStarbucks has never considered adding a retention requirement to the program, Kelly said, because the company wants \"to offer access to education that people can take with them on their journey, no matter where it takes them.\"\n\nFor Yancey, her Starbucks journey is winding down, but it's not over. She continues to work part-time as a barista and has a second job as a music instructor, while planning her next career moves.\n\n\"They find a way to make it work for whoever wants to go into the university through the SCAP program; they find a way for you to complete it,\" Yancey said. \"I don't think finances or learning ability should hold anybody back, and they really delivered on that.\"",

    "description": "The billion-dollar unicorn isn't all that special anymore. Welcome to the age of the hectocorn, when startups are valued in the hundreds of billions.",
    "fullText": "Nearly two decades ago, tech startups used to chase the distinct pedigree of being a unicorn — reaching a $1 billion valuation.\n\nNow, fast-growing tech startups like OpenAI and SpaceX have shifted the goal posts by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThe era of the hectocorn has arrived. It is a small but growing club, and you must be valued at more than $100 billion to qualify.\n\nThe next company to join the list could be Waymo, the self-driving robotaxi startup owned by Alphabet Inc. The autonomous automaker is in talks to raise billions in a new round of funding that could send its value soaring past $100 billion, multiple outlets reported on Wednesday.\n\nHere are seven startups that have already reached hectocorn status.\n\nOne of the buzziest startups to emerge in Silicon Valley over the last decade is OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. After launching in 2022, the AI-powered chatbot attracted hundreds of millions of weekly users, cementing OpenAI's position as a leader in the AI race.\n\nCEO Sam Altman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015.\n\nOpenAI reached a $500 billion valuation in October after a secondary share sale, making it, at least for a few months, the most valuable private company in the world. The Information reported on Wednesday that it is seeking to raise many billions more at a gobsmacking $750 billion valuation.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk expanded his business portfolio in 2002 when he founded SpaceX, an aerospace startup based in Texas that has completed over 320 launches. The core mission for SpaceX is to make humanity multi-planetary.\n\nSpaceX has secured numerous contracts with NASA. In 2024, NASA tapped SpaceX to retrieve the International Space Station from orbit in 2030 before its operational life is over.\n\nSpaceX was the most valuable private company in the world, with a $400 billion valuation, before OpenAI surpassed it in October. SpaceX, however, is planning its own secondary share sale, which would value it at a whopping $800 billion.\n\nThe startup is also exploring an initial public offering in 2026, at a potential valuation of $1.5 trillion.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei and President Daniela Amodei cofounded Anthropic, an AI startup, alongside four others in 2021.\n\nAll of them were former employees of OpenAI.\n\nAnthropic's main product is Claude, a family of large language models that power an eponymous AI chatbot.\n\nAnthropic has received major investments from tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as well as the pick-and-shovel company of the AI rush, chipmaker Nvidia.\n\nIn September, Anthopic's valuation reached $183 billion. However, Business Insider reported in November that Google is in discussions to increase its investment in Anthropic, which could boost its value past $350 billion.\n\nByteDance, based in China, gained widespread recognition through its popular social media app, TikTok. Although the startup introduced the app to Chinese users in 2016, it later launched an international version a year later. It also acquired the popular app Musical.ly that year, transferring all its users to TikTok, which fueled its growth.\n\nTikTok is now one of the most widely used social media sites in the world. It specializes in short-form videos and opened a popular e-commerce retailer, TikTok Shop, in 2023.\n\nZhang Yiming founded ByteDance in 2012, and its current CEO is Liang Rubo.\n\nIn August, ByteDance valued itself at $330 billion as it explored a share buyback program for employees. Fidelity, an early investor in ByteDance, has valued the company even higher, at $380 billion.\n\nDatabricks is a software and AI startup founded in 2013. It is led by cofounder Ali Ghodsi, who serves as CEO. Databricks offers enterprises its Data Intelligence Platform, which manages and implements cloud infrastructure.\n\nThe startup says it uses generative AI to understand an enterprise's data, then \"it automatically optimizes performance and manages infrastructure to match your business needs.\"\n\nDatabricks was on track to become a hectocorn in 2024 when it announced a new funding round to raise $10 billion, lifting its valuation to $62 billion.\n\nDatabricks recently announced it was raising over $4 billion in a new funding round, raising its valuation to $134 billion.\n\nBrothers John Collison and Patrick Collison founded Stripe, an online payment startup for businesses, in 2010.\n\nStripe reached a $20 billion valuation in 2018 but has grown rapidly in recent years. The startup reached a $36 billion valuation in 2020 and $95 billion the following year after a $600 million raise.\n\nIn September, Bloomberg reported that Stripe's value had risen to $106.7 billion, putting it just barely in the hectocorn club.\n\nxAI is Elon Musk's newest business venture, founded in 2023. The startup develops AI tools, including Grok, a large language model that powers a chatbot of the same name. Musk has implemented the technology across his companies, including X and Tesla.\n\nReports in November 2024 valued the startup at $50 billion. That number rose in March to $80 billion after xAI acquired X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter that Musk purchased in 2022. At the time, Musk said X was valued at $33 billion, so the two startups reached a combined valuation of $113 billion.\n\nMultiple outlets reported in November that xAI was raising another $15 billion, at a $230 billion valuation. Musk, however, denied those reports at the time.",

    "description": "\"For Love & Money\" answers your relationship and money questions. This week, a reader struggles with her husband's stress about saving for retirement.",
    "fullText": "I have a large inheritance coming my way when my grandmother dies. She's still alive and healthy, so it feels gross even talking about it at this stage, but she's 86 and has had us sit down with her estate planner to explain how her trust for me would work.\n\nMy husband and I are both 42 and work great jobs with high incomes. Between the retirement packages we have in place and my grandma's money, we'll have more than enough to ride out the 20 to 30 years we will hopefully have left if we retire at 65.\n\nThe problem is our quality of life right now. My husband has a lot of anxiety around money, and he groans constantly about never getting to retire and working till he dies. Anytime I suggest we do anything fun with our money, he shuts it down because he thinks we should be saving for retirement.\n\nWhen I argue that we're more than fine and that we can count on grandma's inheritance, he acts like it's stupid for me to really think that's going to happen. He says that the money will probably get tied up in court, or she won't keep her word.\n\nI'm a fun person with a lust for life and adventure. I'm sick of his negativity and find his inability to enjoy life with me exhausting. How do I get through to this man?\n\nWith two high incomes, retirement saving plans in place, and a generous inheritance on the way, I agree that your future financial security is well in hand. More money won't solve your problems because the problem isn't a lack of funds. Instead, the solution to your husband's negativity and \"inability to enjoy life,\" as you put it, will require the much more complex work of a mindset shift.\n\nA common issue affecting couples is the frequent, conflict-prone pairing of fun-loving types with serious-minded counterparts. You know the type: Guests are arriving in an hour, and one person thinks the house looks great and is just looking forward to watching the game with friends, while the other is having heart palpitations over the baseboards. One person wants to jump in the car and go on an adventure, but the other can't leave the house without a bag packed for doomsday. Or — and this one might sound familiar — one person wants to travel, live generously, and bask in the present; the other wants to save for retirement and safeguard the future. Who is \"right\" depends entirely on the individual situation, and the healthiest functioning is found in the balance of the two.\n\nWhat makes finding this balance so difficult is that the mismatch is rarely as simple as opposites attracting. No, the incompatibility is more dynamic than that. It's losing thousands of dollars because your spouse never got around to filling out their expense reports. It's having a terrible vacation because your partner won't stop checking their bank account app. When our significant others fail us in these ways, we tend to try to compensate for their shortcomings ourselves. But overcompensating for them will only make our partners feel the need to overcompensate for us — worsening the imbalance.\n\nThe only way to break this cycle is for one person to stop participating in it. In the case of you and your husband, you need to stop seeing it as your full-time job to elicit your husband's reluctant buy-in to a joyful, adventurous life that you alone must manufacture. You also need to recognize that when you say, \"We don't need to worry about the future,\" what he hears is that he now has to worry for both of you.\n\nInstead, show him it's possible to be fiscally responsible and have a good time. Make an appointment with a financial advisor to get hard numbers and set clear retirement objectives. Then, treat this information as the actionable intel that it is. If your husband keeps trying to shut down your attempts to have a good time after you've walked through the numbers together, go on your adventure without him. Perhaps, if your husband sees you actively participating in your retirement strategy beyond depending on inherited wealth, he'll feel less stressed about it.\n\nOver time, he may realize that you're right, the sky isn't falling, and that your grasp on the numbers is as strong and steady as his own. In the meantime, you're still living the life you want and deserve.\n\nThat said, when you share a life with someone you love, I know that watching them remain stubbornly dissatisfied when your circumstances are objectively wonderful tends to drain the joy out of your experience as well. It may be worth exploring if his anxiety about the future is a deeper-rooted personal struggle. If it is, there's nothing you can do to change his mindset; he has to do that.\n\nHowever, you can support your husband in this by being gentle but honest with him. Gentle, because living with his scarcity mindset is likely just as exhausting for him as it is for you. And honest, because, as his spouse, there may be no one else to tell him he needs help and doesn't have to exist in a perpetual state of dread and doom. Help him find a therapist to help him work through his fear of the future and the roots of his relationship with money.\n\nIf nothing else, your gentle, honest support will show him that he can count on you no matter what happens. And with time, perhaps you can both find peace and joy in a life that balances spontaneous adventure with long-term security.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

    "fullText": "NGL, an anonymous messaging app that soared to the top of the Apple app charts in 2022 before reaching a settlement with federal regulators for targeting minors, has been acquired by Mode Mobile, a smartphone company that allows users to earn rewards.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStarted in a WeWork, NGL never raised outside funding and stayed lean with only five employees. Named after an acronym for \"Not Gonna Lie,\" the app debuted in November 2021 and briefly shot to the No. 1 overall spot on Apple's US App Store in 2022.\n\n\"Anonymous apps have long held a certain kind of allure for young people,\" Business Insider wrote at the time in 2022. \"They offer a sense of anticipation, a dopamine hit if the anonymous comments or questions are favorable. Will someone confess their feelings for you? Shower you with compliments? One can only hope.\"\n\nNGL surged in popularity, but much of that growth came from illegally targeting minors, according to a 2024 complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission and Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.\n\n\"NGL marketed its app to kids and teens despite knowing that it was exposing them to cyberbullying and harassment,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in a statement.\n\nNGL and its founders paid a $5 million fine to settle and agreed to no longer market to minors.\n\nSince then, cofounders Raj Vir and João Figueiredo have refocused the app on adults and strengthened safety measures.\n\n\"There was a short-term effect from restricting under-18 usage, followed by renewed momentum after refocusing on an 18+ audience,\" said Figueiredo, who says the app now has reached the point where he believes it would be best to sell.\n\n\"NGL stands out as one of the most culturally relevant Gen-Z platforms operating at true global scale, with more than 125 million monthly active users and one of the strongest viral loops we've seen replicate across countries and cultures,\" Dan Novaes, CEO and Co-founder of Mode Mobile, wrote in an email.\n\nThe company's three employees will join Mode Mobile, while Vir and Figueiredo say they will move on to pursue other unspecified projects while also advising during the transition.\n\nOther anonymous messaging apps, such as Ask.fm, Yik Yak, Yolo, and LMK, have also been criticized for facilitating cyberbullying and harassment. Ask.fm shut down last year.",

I’ve gone for this one, however, which lets everyone pick a cake to play as before competing in food fights and taking on mini-games such as roasting marshmallows and lobbing fruit into a pie. If you ever wished that the Great British Bake Off was ever-so-slightly more gladitorial, this is the game for you.\n\nEver wanted to use a friend or family member as a makeshift bridge to navigate a ravine? Now – finally! – is your chance. Heave Ho is a puzzle platformer in which up to four players take part as stretchy creatures navigating increasingly complex and deadly levels by pulling, throwing and expanding each other in ridiculous ways. Communication and experimentation are important – as is not getting too annoyed when Uncle Kevin accidentally catapults you to your certain doom.\n\nThe latest in the long series of excellent quiz games returns for its 11th outing, allowing up to eight players to compete in a series of themed rounds involving doodling, making sound effects and, of course, trivia. Participants will need to be quiet (ie sober) enough to concentrate on the rules of each game, so maybe start the evening with this one.\n\nWhere would Christmas be without karaoke? It doesn’t bear thinking about. Let’s Sing 2026 comes with 35 hits from the likes of Chappell Roan, Lola Young and Lewis Capaldi, but you also get a month’s free access to the game’s online jukebox where you’ll find hundreds more, including lots of classics. You can buy a bundle pack with two USB microphones or download an app that lets you use your phone as a mic. Alternatively, Just Dance 2026 Edition is energetic and hilarious, but requires more room and coordination – it’s all fun and games until someone moonwalks into your Ming dynasty vase.\n\nFor those weird families who prefer cooperation to competition, here’s a gorgeous shooter for up to four players in which everyone works together to keep a spaceship functioning, each player racing between different stations to fire at enemies, repair damage and charge shields. If you’ve ever wanted to shout “protect the hyperdrive!” at your nan, now is your chance.\n\nThe ultimate accessible driving game, featuring simple (yet deep) controls, fun characters and crazy circuits, all within an explorable open-world map. The presence of weapons such as homing missile shells means even complete newcomers have a chance to win, but the real victory is the utter chaos you cause along the way. If you don’t yet have a Switch 2, Mario Kart 8 works just as well.\n\nIf you’re looking to experience the sheer fun of moving house without the expense or inconvenience, this is the co-op puzzle game for you. You play as a removal firm, carefully working together to carry sofas, tables and other fragile household items to your truck, as quickly as possible without smashing anything. I give it three minutes before every Friends fan in your house is shouting “pivot!!”\n\nPerfectly described by the developer as, “a cooperative shouting game”, SpaceTeam allows up to eight players (each with a copy of the game on their phone) to cosplay as the bridge crew of a malfunctioning star craft, yelling orders at each other according to onscreen prompts. It’s loud and hilarious and will fit the mood of any raucous Christmas Eve get-together.",

    "description": "Stacey Kennedy fills her day with espresso breaks and leans on her team to help her stay on time. At night, she prefers a book to a TV show.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Stacey Kennedy, the US CEO for Philip Morris International, based in Stamford, Connecticut. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI began my career with Philip Morris International, a tobacco company, in 1995 as a territory sales manager. I held several other positions before becoming vice president of sales for the Southeast region in Atlanta in 2006.\n\nFrom there, I worked in Lausanne at the VP level and subsequently became the managing director for multiple countries in Europe, before being appointed president of the South and Southeast Asia region. I assumed the role of CEO of PMI's US business in January 2023.\n\nI just celebrated 30 years at PMI. I've spent half of my career in the US and half outside the US. I'm a former smoker myself who switched to IQOS, a heated tobacco product, more than a decade ago.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nI allow myself five minutes to check my phone and ensure there's nothing urgent, as we're a global business and things can happen overnight.\n\nI start my mornings with a mantra of 'pay myself first.' I've adopted the mental image of putting my own oxygen mask on first, because if you start the day refreshed, you can show up as a better leader.\n\nIn my ideal morning, I get out of the house and take a mindful walk in my neighborhood. I add a 15-minute yoga routine after the walk.\n\nThe less ideal morning is when I skip the walk, either because the weather isn't great or I decide to trade it for 30 minutes of extra sleep, and then try to get my 15 minutes of yoga and stretching to start the day, regardless.\n\nI'm not a big breakfast person, so I might grab a handful of berries or a couple of figs. I always have a double espresso from my Nespresso machine. Occasionally, I'll have a matcha from a Cuzen Matcha maker.\n\nI usually go into the office in Stamford four days a week on average, and it's about a 25-minute drive away. What makes me anxious before walking into the office is whether the business is moving fast enough — if we're innovating with urgency while staying disciplined and responsible.\n\nMy mornings are filled with meetings. I've ensured we have a well-organized office layout with numerous open spaces, a barista bar, and coffee corners.\n\nI spend a lot of my morning with my direct reports, working on our strategic plans, and there's a lot of travel mixed in there, too.\n\nWe have our flagship factory in Owensboro, Kentucky, and we're building a new factory in Aurora, Colorado. Additionally, we have an office in Washington, D.C., where I spend time on policy and regulatory matters. I work with our teams and policymakers and regulators, including the FDA, to ensure adult smokers have access to better alternatives.\n\nWe start with the global management team and board meetings, which are fixed on the calendar. We're usually six weeks out for non-fixed things that come up on the schedule.\n\nWe've developed interesting ways to ensure that there's free and flexible time. We have something called P.O.D.D. meetings — a problem, opportunity, discussion, and decision meeting. We address issues that arise and ensure we don't miss a critical opportunity.\n\nOne of my leadership principles is to identify your strengths and operate from a position of strength, while also acknowledging your weaknesses. I have my fair share of flaws; one of mine is the importance of running timely, efficient, and effective meetings.\n\nI'm not a particularly timely person myself — I just don't possess that capability. To me, time is a concept, and as a curious person, I love engaging in conversations. When I get into a deep discussion or solve a problem, I honestly can't tell you if I've spent 40 minutes or four hours, because I'm fully immersed. My husband is an extremely timely person, so this drives him bananas.\n\nI think it's a great way to sit and hear different topics from different groups.\n\nI usually have lunch in a conference room or an open space. Sometimes, I go down to the canteen, but I prefer to have a smaller group with me so I can actually have a conversation.\n\nIf I'm choosing my meal, it's usually a salad with grilled chicken and a drizzle of olive oil. If it's a lunch arranged around a bigger meeting, my assistant chooses, and I'm very happy to eat what someone else has decided. It's one less decision to make.\n\nI take a moment at the end of the day with my chief of staff and assistant to reflect on what we accomplished that day and review the schedule for the rest of the week.\n\nMy job is very demanding, and it's easy to get overwhelmed; it's also easy to get frustrated. My non-negotiable indulgence that gets me through the day is a strong espresso and an IQOS break.\n\nDuring the moments when things feel overwhelming, I almost always go to a gratitude practice. It's amazing how much it shifts your entire mood and perspective away from the things that frustrate or make you grumpy and onto the things that are so important to be grateful for.\n\nI try to have dinner with the family at 7 p.m., but sometimes it ends up being 7:30 p.m., depending on whether my teenage 16-year-old twins have sports practice after school.\n\nNormally, I'm the chef, and when I travel, I try to set my husband up for success — he's definitely not a chef. We had to have crockpot lessons.\n\nI cook a Mediterranean-style diet. It's likely a salad with grilled fish and possibly rice.\n\nWe have a 'check your phone at the door' policy, and it's been a game changer for the whole family. My husband almost always brings an interesting topic to the dinner table. It's a great way for our kids to develop their own perspective on things.\n\nI've gotten into a couple of shows with the kids on weekends, and my son has a wicked sense of humor, so we got into Parks and Recreation. We don't watch TV during the week, because they're off with their homework.\n\nI almost always have a decaf espresso with my husband after dinner and debrief on our day.\n\nI read in the evening for anywhere between 30 and 60 minutes. I usually allow myself two fiction books and a nonfiction book. I save fiction for the weekend, because once I start a fiction book, it's really hard to put it down.\n\nGoing to bed before 10 p.m. is really tough for me, but I try to have my lights out by 11 p.m. so I can have an ideal morning.\n\nI usually do a quick check-in before I start reading, so if everything's OK by 10 p.m., we're good to go.\n\nIf I check in, I try not to get caught up in responding to everyone. Sometimes I do. I might send my chief of staff a quick note so that she can get this organized first thing in the morning, but I limit myself to no more than five to 10 minutes of work-related tasks at night.\n\nWhen I go to bed, I'm a great sleeper. I'm about asleep the second my head hits the pillow.\n\nI rarely go into the office, but I do work to engineer any tasks that need to be done on the weekends around the family schedule.\n\nI attend as many regattas as I can. My son is in crew and loves it, and my daughter's in debate. I volunteer as a parent judge at debate competitions.\n\nMy non-routine routine is what helps me show up as my best. If I'm too routine and scheduled, I feel like I'm in a box. I need a bit of free space and curiosity to drive me.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: UK government’s ‘naive belief’ that Trump is a good faith actor ‘could cost UK taxpayer billions’, says health select committee chair\n\nMinisters and senior MPs have warned that the UK’s agreements with Donald Trump are “built on sand” after the Guardian established that the deal to avoid drug tariffs has no underlying text beyond limited headline terms.\n\nThe “milestone” US-UK deal announced this month on pharmaceuticals, which will mean the NHS pays more for medicines in exchange for a promise of zero tariffs on the industry, still lacks a legal footing beyond top lines contained in two government press releases.\n\nConcerns over the basis of the agreement have been heightened by Washington’s decision to suspend the £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, which had been hailed as “a generational step-change in our relationship with the US”. The deal was paused after the US claimed a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nIt has also emerged that concessions to British farmers made in the first tariff deal with Trump, which were hailed as “historic” by Keir Starmer in May, have yet to be signed off by the US despite a looming January deadline.\n\nThe health department said that negotiators were now thrashing out the detailed agreement on the pharmaceutical deal. Asked to provide the headline terms, the department shared its press release hailing the “landmark UK-US pharmaceuticals deal” and a link to the equivalent US government announcement of an “agreement in principle” on pharmaceutical pricing.\n\nCritics have noted that the two releases describe the deal in sharply different terms. The British release describes the UK as “the only country in the world to secure a 0% tariff on pharmaceuticals to the US”, while the American one largely focuses on how the NHS will have to pay 25% more for new medicines.\n\nDavid Henig, a trade expert, said: “There is a serious risk that the UK government has made commitments to raise drug prices in return for nothing more than a verbal promise from President Trump around zero tariffs, when we know he has form for not honouring his word.\n\n“The role of private companies in possibly working with the US administration to coerce the UK government by threatening to withdraw investments is also a big worry. None of this is normal in international trade policy and the government needs to explain both this deal and how such things will be avoided in the future.”\n\nOrdinarily, negotiators would sign a provisional legal text, which would then go through detailed checks on both sides, but none exists yet with the US on pharmaceuticals.\n\nMinisters privately told the Guardian there were concerns that the government’s agreements with the US were flimsy and unreliable.\n\nOne said there was a concern that the UK’s series of agreements with the Trump administration were “built on sand”. Another said this instability was the “new normal now in our relationship across the pond” with “additional layers of volatility and unpredictability in the system”.\n\nLayla Moran, who chairs the health select committee, said: “The only thing more surprising than Trump’s tween-level temper tantrums is the UK government’s naive belief that his administration is a good faith actor. The NHS is too precious to be gambled with and the concern now is whether the deal that could already cost the UK taxpayer billions could end up costing a lot more if it collapses in chaos.”\n\nLiam Byrne, who chairs the business and trade select committee, said ministers had to focus on getting the tech prosperity deal “back on track”.\n\nGovernment figures downplayed the chances of the US reneging on the pharma deal, which took weeks longer to finalise than expected. One source said the US pharmaceutical industry had been pushing for the agreement as they wanted certainty on imports and drug prices, while by comparison the tech prosperity deal “was always quite abstract”.\n\nOfficials admit that, more broadly, volatility is part and parcel of dealing with the Trump administration. But they note that through the deals it has signed, the UK has secured concrete outcomes for businesses.\n\n“The fact we have 25% steel tariffs, and that’s better than the rest of the world, is not flimsy. The same thing with our auto rate,” one official said. “We are in a more competitive position than other major economies.”\n\nIssues have emerged in the implementation of the landmark US-UK tariff deal agreed last May, however, with quotas on beef exports that were due to kick in next month still not formally approved.\n\nTom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Our understanding is that the US has not yet signed off the 13,000 reciprocal tariff rate quota. With the US already having access to our beef market for non-hormone treated beef, we are pushing to make sure UK beef producers can access the reciprocal quota from 1 January as agreed.\n\n“This is particularly important as we know there is still great pressure from other sectors of the economy to reopen US negotiations, and that our government is looking at what more can be done with the US. We urge the government to keep pushing to get the reciprocal quota over the line before the end of the year to ensure it can’t continue to be used as a bargaining chip.”\n\nApart from introducing a 10% tariff on most British exports – lower than the rate paid by other countries – the deal was to “remove tariffs on British steel and aluminium, reducing them to zero”. This aspect of the agreement has not materialised, with tariffs on British steel remaining at 25%, although other countries pay a rate of 50%.\n\nOne industry leader said the discussions on steel tariffs “were not going anywhere” but that they considered this week’s bump in the road to be a matter of the “US blustering because of frustration with the UK not moving fast enough in other areas”.\n\nThe US informed the UK it was pausing the tech prosperity deal over wider trade disagreements last week before Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, held meetings with senior US officials in Washington, including commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nSeveral officials said those meetings were “very positive”. The two sides have agreed to resume negotiations in January.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the trade secretary held talks last week in the US with counterparts to keep up the momentum on implementing all aspects of the UK-US deal so businesses on both sides of the Atlantic continue to feel the benefits.\n\n“We have already delivered 0% tariffs for the UK pharma and aerospace sectors and cut auto tariffs to 10% within quota, saving hundreds of millions of pounds on UK exports, with the US confirming changes via federal notices.\n\n“The UK is also the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs, but we are committed to going further to secure jobs and creating opportunities for businesses, and at the state visit we unveiled commercial deals creating more than 7,600 high-quality jobs and accelerating growth.”",

    "description": "Even as AI roles increase, mentions of the technology in job listings are down. It's a sign that bosses already expect you to use the technology.",
    "fullText": "That job description you're reading might not mention AI, but an employer will likely still expect you to know how to use it.\n\nA new snapshot of job listings from career platform Ladders showed that, while the number of AI roles listed on the site has tripled since 2021, the share of postings mentioning AI has decreased.\n\nIt's an indication that more employers are viewing technology as an everyday skill rather than as a differentiator, Marc Cenedella, founder and CEO of Ladders, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It will be mentioned less and less in the same way that Microsoft Office isn't mentioned in job postings anymore,\" he said.\n\nAmong about a dozen job categories Ladders reviewed, each saw a drop in postings that name-checked AI. For design and UX roles, AI mentions dropped from 56.7% of jobs in 2021 to 44.6% in 2025. Listings for product management positions registered a similar decrease.\n\nEven in software engineering, where the proliferation of coding agents has raised concerns that junior coders, in particular, will have a harder time finding work, AI references in job listings decreased from 53.5% to 45.8% in the four-year span.\n\nMentions of AI in job listings could pick up again, Cenedella said, if specialized tools emerge in different industries, though he said that might not happen until sometime in 2026 or 2027.\n\nIf that shift does come, it might mean that people in areas such as sales, pharmaceuticals, or semiconductors could need to demonstrate fluency with specific AI applications or methods for using the technology, Cenedella said. Employers could then start calling out those skills in job postings.\n\nThe overall drop in mentions of AI doesn't mean interest in the technology is fading, especially in certain areas. Ladders found that about 525,000 leadership and executive roles include AI references, up from 213,000 in 2021. All told, in 2025, the technology has been mentioned in 45% of executive postings on the site.\n\nRoles that aren't primarily technical — areas like finance, ops, design, sales, and project management — are seeing some of the fastest increases in AI skills adoption, Ladders found.\n\nOne reason, Cenedella said, is because the technology is moving so fast.\n\nOverall, Ladders said that jobs specifically about AI, such as engineering roles, shot up on its site to 6.7 million in 2025 from 2.1 million in 2021.\n\nRegardless of whether a job posting mentions AI, a boss will likely want you to be able to use it, Agur Jõgi, chief technology officer at the software company Pipedrive, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's just like a ticket to the game,\" he said.\n\nJõgi said that you need to understand how AI is transforming your field and how it's affecting your job. \"That enables you to move as fast as the rest of the industry is moving,\" Jõgi said.\n\nJõgi said that if you're a holdout who's resisting using the technology, it could mean you're in for longer days if you want to keep up with colleagues who are going all in.\n\nEventually, as more people embrace AI, the early adopters who juiced their workplace productivity through AI will see that advantage fade, he said. To maintain it, Jõgi said, these go-getters will need to develop a fresh advantage.\n\n\"To beat the competition, you need to do something smarter, or you need to do slightly more,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "September 10, 2025 was one of the feel-good days of the year in markets.\n\nAt the center of the party was Oracle, the legacy tech company who stormed the gates of the AI trade with a blockbuster forecast for its cloud-infrastructure business.\n\nInvestors were so fired up about Oracle's AI guidance that they sent shares soaring as much as 43% that day. The company was briefly more valuable than JPMorgan. Larry Ellison overtook Elon Musk as the world's richest person — for a couple of hours at least. The S&P 500 finished the day at a record high. The vibes were immaculate.\n\nNow, in retrospect, the whole ordeal feels like the overreaction of the year.\n\nOracle's stock is down 46% since that blissful high, and now sits with a positive return of just 7% for the year, roughly half of the S&P 500.\n\nIn the process, the stock has become a poster child of a new market trend that's been percolating for weeks: Companies in the AI trade are priced to perfection, and anything seen falling short of lofty expectations will be punished.\n\nJust ask Meta, Microsoft, or any of the other AI companies that got dinged this past earnings season for lagging forecasts.\n\nOracle has gotten hit particularly hard by two disappointing developments in quick succession. Last Thursday, the company notched an 11% loss after spending way more than analysts expected on AI data centers during the previous quarter. Then, this Wednesday, the company shed another 5% after a key investor backed out of a $10 billion data center deal.\n\nThe market reactions perfectly encapsulate the messages investors have been sending tech to companies in recent weeks: Stop spending so much, and start producing some results. The possible delay of a hotly anticipated data center doesn't fit that bill.\n\nCoreWeave is another data-center-focused company that's felt the same wrath from investors. The former market darling — which spiked more than 400% in the weeks after its March IPO — is down more than 60% since then. The culprit? Data center delays.\n\nAll of the above has combined to dent the invincibility of the AI trade. Gone are the days of indiscriminate gains for anyone doing anything AI-related. Investors are being more discerning, and holding companies to a higher standard of progress.\n\nThe AI bubble may not be fully popping yet, but there's definite deflation happening in the areas of the market struggling to keep up with expectations.",

    "description": "Study uncovers a new Alzheimer’s trigger — and a way to stop it",
    "fullText": "Study uncovers a new Alzheimer’s trigger — and a way to stop it\n\nJournal: Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association\n\nEVANSTON, Ill. --- An experimental drug developed at Northwestern University has demonstrated further promise as an early intervention for Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nIn a new study, Northwestern scientists identified a previously unknown highly toxic sub-species of amyloid beta oligomers — toxic clusters of peptides — that appear to drive several of the brain’s earliest changes, including neuronal dysfunction, inflammation and activation of immune cells.\n\nThe experimental drug, a small-molecule compound called NU-9, decreased this toxic amyloid beta oligomer subtype and dramatically reduced the damage it causes in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. By addressing these changes at the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, the researchers are hopeful NU-9 potentially could prevent, or significantly delay, the cascade of toxic events that ultimately destroy neurons.\n\nThe findings point to a potential new strategy for targeting the disease in its earliest stages — before cognitive decline and other debilitating symptoms take hold.\n\nThe study will be published on Dec. 18 in Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\n“Alzheimer’s disease begins decades before its symptoms appear, with early events like toxic amyloid beta oligomers accumulating inside neurons and glial cells becoming reactive long before memory loss is apparent,” said Northwestern’s Daniel Kranz, the study’s first author. “By the time symptoms emerge, the underlying pathology is already advanced. This is likely a major reason many clinical trials have failed. They start far too late. In our study, we administered NU-9 before symptom onset, modeling this early, pre-symptomatic window.”\n\nKranz is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences (IBiS) program at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, where he is advised by corresponding author William Klein. An expert on Alzheimer’s disease, Klein is a professor of neurobiology at Weinberg and a cofounder of Acumen Pharmaceuticals, which has developed a therapeutic monoclonal antibody currently in clinical trials that targets the subtype of amyloid beta oligomers identified in the study. Richard Silverman, a key co-author of the study, invented NU-9. Silverman, who previously invented pregabalin (Lyrica) to treat fibromyalgia, nerve pain and epilepsy, is the Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor in Weinberg’s Department of Chemistry and founder of Akava Therapeutics, a startup company commercializing NU-9 (now called AKV9).\n\nConceived about 15 years ago, NU-9 emerged as part of Silverman’s multi-year effort to discover a small molecule compound that could prevent toxic protein aggregate buildup in neurodegenerative diseases. By 2021, NU-9 demonstrated efficacy in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), clearing toxic SOD1 and TDP-43 proteins and restoring health to upper motor neurons. In 2024, it received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin human clinical trials for ALS.\n\nEarlier this year, Silverman, Klein and Kranz demonstrated that NU-9 also could effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease. In the previous study, NU-9 showed it could clear toxic amyloid beta oligomers in lab-grown brain cells from the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory.\n\n“In both ALS and Alzheimer’s disease, cells suffer from toxic protein buildup,” Klein said. “Cells have a mechanism to get rid of these proteins, but it gets damaged in degenerative diseases like ALS and Alzheimer’s. NU-9 is rescuing the pathway that saves the cell.”\n\nTo further investigate the drug’s potential in treating Alzheimer’s disease, the team wanted to evaluate its effectiveness at halting the earliest damage. In the new study, the researchers administered NU-9 to a pre-symptomatic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. The mice received a daily oral dose for 60 days.\n\nThe results were striking. NU-9 significantly reduced early reactive astrogliosis, an inflammatory reaction that typically begins long before symptoms appear. The number of toxic amyloid beta oligomers bound to astrocytes (star-shaped brain cells that protect neurons and control inflammation) also plummeted. And an abnormal form of the protein TDP-43 — a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases that is linked to cognitive impairments — sharply decreased.\n\n“These results are stunning,” Klein said. “NU-9 had an outstanding effect on reactive astrogliosis, which is the essence of neuroinflammation and linked to the early stage of the disease.”\n\nThe improvements spanned multiple regions of the brain, indicating that NU-9 has a brain-wide anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nWhile investigating the effects of NU-9 on the pre-symptomatic mouse model, the research team found an unexpected culprit. For decades, scientists have considered amyloid beta oligomers as more toxic than the larger amyloid beta fibrils that form plaques, which appear later in Alzheimer’s disease. But not all amyloid beta oligomers are the same. The Northwestern scientists discovered one uniquely problematic subtype.\n\n“We identified a distinct amyloid beta oligomer subtype that appears inside neurons and on nearby reactive astrocytes very early in the disease,” Kranz said. “It potentially acts as an instigator of early Alzheimer’s pathology.”\n\nCalled ACU193+ because it is detected by the antibody ACU193, the subtype shows up early inside of stressed neurons, the scientists found. Then, these oligomers appear to migrate to the surfaces of nearby astrocytes. When ACU193+ oligomers latch onto astrocytes, they may spark a cascade of inflammation that spreads throughout the brain, long before memory loss begins.\n\nNU-9 targeted and dramatically reduced this subtype, suggesting the drug may be especially valuable at Alzheimer’s earliest stages, when intervention is most effective. By reducing this subtype, NU-9 potentially could prevent the activation of astrocytes.\n\nAlthough they serve as the brain’s frontline responders, astrocytes become destructive when pushed into a reactive state. This destructive behavior damages synapses, releases inflammatory molecules and accelerates neurodegeneration. Stopping this process might be one of the most powerful ways to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nKranz and Silverman likened the strategy to early intervention approaches for preventing cancer and heart disease.\n\n“Most people are used to monitoring their cholesterol levels,” Silverman said. “If you have high cholesterol, it doesn’t mean that you will have a heart attack soon. But it’s time to take drugs to lower your cholesterol levels to prevent that heart attack from happening down the road. NU-9 could play a similar role. If someone has a biomarker signaling Alzheimer’s disease, then they could start taking NU-9 before symptoms appear.”\n\n“There are a couple early diagnostic blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease in development,” Klein added. “The promise of better early diagnostics — combined with a drug that could stop the disease in its tracks — is the goal.”\n\nCurrently, the team is testing NU-9 in additional models of Alzheimer’s disease, including an animal model of late-onset disease that better reflects typical human aging. The researchers also plan to follow animals for a longer period of time to determine whether symptoms develop in treated animals and plan to examine how early intervention with NU-9 affects memory and neuron health over time.\n\nThe study, “Identification of a glia-associated amyloid beta oligomer subtype and the rescue from reactive astrogliosis by inhibitor NU-9,” was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grant AG061708).\n\nEditor’s note: Silverman has financial interests in Akava Therapeutics. Klein has financial interests in Acumen Pharmaceuticals. Northwestern University has financial interests (equities, royalties) in Akava Therapeutics and Acumen Pharmaceuticals.\n\nProfessor of Neurobiology\n\nWeinberg College of Arts and Sciences\n\nProfessor of Neurology\n\nFeinberg School of Medicine",

The best co-op horror games lean into the potential for mess by designing challenges that require communication--whether you’re hunting ghosts, escaping monsters, solving puzzles, or simply trying not to die first.\n\nTurning group dynamics into gameplay mechanics isn't easy, and there are plenty of duds out there. Fear not, however, as we've hand-picked the best co-op horror games to keep you on your collective toes. If you're not quite ready for the spookiest of scares, check out our list of the best gateway horror games for slightly tamer terrors.\n\nThe House of the Dead: Remake is just how you remember the original--janky, absurd, over-acted… and ridiculously fun to play with a friend. The classic 1996 arcade rail shooter got a full update in 2022 with modern graphics, updated controls, and cooperative gameplay that remains faithful to the original’s chaotic charm. It is not going to be the best game you've ever played, but it offers a great deal of fun when played with an armed pal by your side.\n\nAs in the original, you and a partner step into the shoes of two (fairly unprofessional) agents battling through waves of grotesque undead creatures and mutated horrors. It's good wholesome reflexive action that feels super satisfying to lean into. If you like arcade-style tension where enemies rush from all directions, House of the Dead: Remake should scratch that itch. The game pummels you with unrelenting waves of weird-and-not-so-wonderful creatures, forcing both players to communicate, divide targets, and react to sudden ambushes at speed.\n\nAlthough it’s not as atmospheric or methodical as modern horror titles, its blend of frantic shooting and B-movie creature designs creates a uniquely entertaining type of fear--one that’s less about ominous cinematic dread, and more about the immediate shock of what’s bursting onto the screen next. House of the Dead: Remake supports couch co-op too, and is extremely easy to pick up--you just point and shoot and reload--making it one of the best local co-op games to play.\n\nBlending the trademark tense atmosphere of the series with a heavy emphasis on teamwork, Resident Evil 5 is a great example of co-op horror done right. Ditching the casual flippancy of a multiplayer game for a heavy dose of lore expansion and genuine storytelling, Resi 5's co-op mode is something you can really get your teeth into. With up to two players in local mode and up to four online, the game puts action at the forefront with narrative not far behind. Limited ammo, dangerously unpredictable enemy types, and claustrophobic encounters are all part of the experience, but yelling at a friend for a dodgy call might just lighten the atmosphere a little.\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of Resident Evil 5's co-op is the way inventory management is shared, meaning players must coordinate healing items, ammunition, and weapon roles. Boss fights often require synchronized strategies--one player may need to distract an enemy while the other attacks weak points or deploys environmental traps. Even simple exploration feels more strategic when both players have to cover different angles or watch each other’s backs during sudden enemy ambushes. You really start feeling like a specialist.\n\nThe game’s set pieces present a hefty challenge, while casual exploration throws up regular enemies that create continuous adrenaline. RE5 is a pretty standout example of how cooperative mechanics can enhance a horror-action hybrid, making it a memorable entry in the Resident Evil franchise and a foundational co-op experience. If you need more Resi in your life after experiencing the thrills first-hand, check out our ranking of the best Resident Evil games.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nPhasmophobia has become a modern co-op horror staple, and is one of the best horror games on Xbox, having revolutionized ghost-hunting simulations with its immersive audio, unpredictable entities, and teamwork-driven objectives. It's the classic fright night setup: up to four players enter haunted locations armed with investigative tools--from EMF readers to spirit boxes--to identify what type of ghost they’re facing. The tension arises not from scripted scares, but from dynamic AI behavior: the ghost roams, reacts to noise, and can hunt players at any time from any angle.\n\nThe heart of Phasmophobia's gameplay is communication. Players can take the classic Scooby Doo route of splitting up and looking for clues, monitoring cameras, or sweeping rooms with EMF detectors, UV lights, or temperature gauges. The need to coordinate evidence, call out discoveries, and warn teammates about ghost activity keeps everyone on edge and hyper-focused on their niche. Because tools are limited, the game encourages you to assign roles strategically, deciding who handles close-range tests and who stays safe to record data.\n\nPhasmophobia’s infectious fear is only amplified by its use of proximity chat and the ghost’s responsiveness to your voice. Its replayability, eerie environments, and emphasis on shared fear make it one of the most influential co-op horror games of the last decade and one you absolutely have to try in the dark.\n\nDead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer horror that you'd have to have been living under a rock not to have heard of. The game pits four survivors against a single killer in tense cat-and-mouse matches, and has collaborated with pretty much every horror franchise you can think of. If you're a fan of Five Nights at Freddy's, The Walking Dead, Alien, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, or even, uh, Nicholas Cage for some reason, you'll find a DLC that tailors the game to your tastes.\n\nSurvivors have to work together to repair generators, avoid detection, and ultimately escape through exit gates--while the killer uses their unique powers to hunt them down. While not strictly co-op in the traditional sense, given that one of you is a killer, teamwork among survivors is essential. Coordinating distractions, rescuing allies, and healing each other become critical skills when it's us against them. The killer, meanwhile, creates constant psychological pressure through audio cues, map control, and sudden chases.\n\nDespite its semi-competitive structure, Dead by Daylight earns its place on this list as its horror is strengthened by cooperative survival. Few games make relying on others feel so essential--or so terrifying.\n\nPerfect for people who like a bit of mystery and find liminal spaces inherently terrifying, Escape the Backrooms turns an iconic creepypasta into a cooperative survival experience filled with unnerving and unseen threats. Players navigate interconnected levels--each with distinct environments, puzzles, and entities--aiming to find exits without getting caught or separated in the confusing expanse of the Backrooms. The game’s procedural unpredictability and eerie soundscapes create a uniquely unsettling atmosphere where you'll be glad to have some backup--as long as they know to keep quiet.\n\nCo-op keeps you sane in the Backrooms. Wandering alone into a monotonous yellow hallway or losing sight of your teammates in a dark industrial level is a singularly terrifying experience. To keep a cool head, you'll have to communicate constantly, share discoveries, and coordinate escapes, as many levels require group problem-solving to progress. When a hostile entity appears, sticking together becomes a matter of survival, though sometimes splitting up is necessary to distract or mislead creatures. Feel free to ditch your friends if you think you can make it alone.\n\nLabyrinthine is a cooperative horror game centered--you may not be surprised to hear--around navigating sprawling mazes filled with puzzles, hidden clues, and terrifying enemies. Up to four players work together to explore hedge mazes, abandoned carnival grounds, and other winding environments, each packed with juicy lore and environmental storytelling. The game blends escape-room-style challenges with atmospheric horror, turning every corner into a potential scare and keeping you dialled up to 100 the entire time.\n\nLabyrinthine's emphasis on puzzle-solving and map awareness sets it apart from its contemporaries. Working in teams, players communicate discoveries and locations and warn each other about roaming monsters that patrol the maze. Since the layouts are complex and often disorienting, you'll find your niche pretty quickly--maybe you're the ideas guy, the quick thinker who deduces puzzle solutions, a bold adventurer, or maybe you'd rather just act as a lookout. If you're a fan of puzzle games, this one might strike a chord.\n\nJumpscares and unexpected encounters add pressure, forcing quick decisions. Will you run, hide, or regroup? And how long can you keep going before you give up? The environment feels just as much an enemy as the physical beings chasing you down, with its creepy dynamic lighting, unsettling audio cues, and moments where players can be separated unexpectedly and forced to fend for themselves.\n\nSimilar to Phasmophobia, but with a stronger focus on ritualistic horror and more detailed environments, Demonologist is another haunting co-op horror game. Teams explore cursed locations like haunted mansions and abandoned asylums, seeking to identify the type of enemy present and banish it using various tools and rituals.\n\nEntities interact with the environment in unsettling ways, lights flicker realistically, objects move suddenly, and apparitions manifest with dramatic intensity, making you feel like you're about to get attacked at any moment. Players need to collaborate closely to gather evidence using EMF meters, spirit boxes, ectoplasma glass, and other instruments. Once the ghost type is identified, you still can't quite relax, needing to then perform an exorcism that requires coordination and timing.\n\nThe combination of tense ritual mechanics, genuinely unexpected scares, and teamwork-heavy gameplay makes Demonologist a strong entry in the co-op horror genre for friends seeking a dark, puzzle-filled ghost-hunting title.\n\nLittle Nightmares III is not the best entry in the acclaimed Little Nightmares series, that goes to the previous game, but this installment introduces cooperative play, allowing two players to explore the haunting, handmade world together as new protagonists, Low and Alone. For that, we still think it worth a play. There's something in the push-and-pull panic of maneuvering these awful situations as two tiny teammates that adds depth to the already-established lore of the series.\n\nPlayers work together to solve puzzles, traverse dangerous environments, and escape grotesque, towering enemies. Each character has a unique item--Low's bow for ranged interactions or Alone's wrench for breaking obstacles--which encourages teamwork and creative problem-solving. You really can't do this alone.\n\nIt can't be denied that co-op also heightens the emotional core of Little Nightmares. The setup has always emphasized vulnerability, and sharing that vulnerability with another player adds a new dimension of hope and despair as you navigate the desolate, surreal landscapes together.\n\nAlthough cross-play and cross-saves are supported, they might take a bit of explaining, so check out our Little Nightmares 3 cross-play guide \n\nIf you like your co-op horror games fast-paced, tense, and packed with jumpscares, Pacify fits the job description. Your task is to investigate haunted locations and attempt to neutralize hostile beings before they attack. The goal is to work together to gather items, complete objectives, and survive increasingly aggressive encounters from spooked-up enemies.\n\nThe game’s frantic nature sets it apart from more methodical ghost-hunting titles like Phasmaphobia or Demonologist. Tasks often require players to split up to find keys, dolls, or ritual materials, but doing so increases the risk of being caught by the unpredictable spirit. When the ghost becomes enraged, the atmosphere shifts dramatically. Lights dim, audio distorts, and players must scramble to regroup or finish objectives quickly and hope for the best.\n\nIt's a simple game with fairly low-budget graphical stylings, but that does nothing to reduce the panic of hearing footsteps behind you or the relief of completing the final objective before you all get slaughtered.\n\nSons of the Forest expands on the survival horror foundation of its popular predecessor with a deeper crafting system, larger map, and improved cooperative mechanics. After crash-landing on a remote island filled with cannibals, mutants, and unsettlingly intelligent enemies (again), you'll need to do everything you can to stay alive and solve the mystery at the heart of The Forest. It's the perfect time to pick it up and get your dose of lore, as the latest upcoming Forest game seems to take place in outer space.\n\nCo-op transforms the experience by letting players divide responsibilities and build complex bases together. Working as a team allows groups to take on the island’s threats with more confidence, particularly when dealing with large mutant encounters or navigating the labyrinthine cave networks that are packed to the gills with enemies.\n\nThe game’s potential AI companions add another cooperative dimension for those who like to play alone, but nothing compares to coordinating with actual teammates. Defending your base from raids, constructing elaborate fortifications, or confronting powerful boss-like enemies becomes far more manageable--and more fun--in a group.\n\nOne for the insatiable urban explorers, Panicore is a cooperative survival horror game that focuses on small-team gameplay and unpredictable, deadly monsters found in abandoned spaces. Schools, hospitals, and other eerie locations are left empty and decaying, clearly heaving with paranormal entities, but your hubristic group of friends just can't resist the allure of the unknown. You'll have to outwit the monsters lurking within, all while keeping quiet and hiding in claustrophobic spaces to stay out of sight.\n\nNavigating dark hallways, searching for keys, and solving tasks all require coordinated effort, particularly when a wrong move can alert the entity instantly. Every second counts, and every brain cell stays engaged as there are multiple answers to the ultimate puzzle: how the hell do we leave this place?",

Sometimes you want to experience a game from start to finish with a friend, enjoying the highs and lows of puzzle solving, combat, or exploration, and working toward a shared outcome.\n\nWhile drop-in co-op is plenty of fun on its own--check out some of our best couch co-op games for plenty of recommendations on that front--this list focuses more on games where communication and collaboration are an intrinsic part of the experience. Quests in these games progress because you're both playing together, rather than despite it. These are games that feel more intimate than competitive multiplayer and more dynamic than traditional couch co-op--sitting in that sweet spot in the middle where both players are equally important.\n\nFrom emotional narratives to mind-bending puzzles, these games offer something for everyone. So grab someone you'd trust with your (virtual) life, and dive into one of these top co-op games for two players.\n\nIt's no secret that we love It Takes Two, we gave it a 9/10 in our review, and when asked for multiplayer games this is one we love to recommend. Hazelight Studios just get it. If you want a game that makes you work together in varied environments, offering innovative gameplay, but you also don't want the saccharine sweetness and lack of personality that comes with some co-op titles, this one is for you. The story is complex, the characters flawed, and the world fully-realised and a joy to explore.\n\nIt Takes Two drops two players into a world where the main characters have been miniaturized. With household objects and the natural world blown up to massive proportions, as well as new doll-like bodies to come to terms with, the couple in question have to successfully navigate a complex platformer-style journey while reflecting on their own fractured relationship. Each level introduces unique mechanics that require constant communication and coordination to overcome as you solve puzzles and defeat enemies. From swinging through forests to navigating fantastical landscapes, the game is both beautiful to look at and mechanically rich, making it one of the most creative co-op experiences available today.\n\nTick Tock: A Tale for Two is a must-play for friends or couples who don't crack under pressure. This mystical puzzle game tasks you with solving a series of challenges in real-time, but each player has a totally different perspective of the world. One person might see a physical piece of the puzzle, while the other might have essential information that completes the solution. As you progress through the game, you learn to effectively share hints, work through time-sensitive puzzles, and piece together clues to unlock the mystery surrounding a strange clock tower--all through voice chat. With its reliance on effective teamwork and constant dialogue, Tick Tock feels like a true test of your ability to collaborate, making it an excellent choice for fans of interactive puzzles, and people with a lot of face in their communication skills.\n\nPortal 2 is a puzzle-platformer that’s also home to one of the greatest gaming moments we can think of (spoilers alert). It earns a place on this list for the attention to detail in the two-player version of the game, a completely unique story and experience built specifically for two players to collaborate on. As Atlas and P-Body, a pair of robot test subjects, you and a friend have to perform a series of tasks in the Aperture Science test chambers. What starts off fairly simple soon becomes a life-or-death situation with increasingly elaborate and chaotic challenges where both of you are necessary keys to solving each puzzle.\n\nEach player has a portal gun, and in the tradition of the original and single-player mode, solving puzzles involves carefully placing portals in the environment to transport both players through obstacles and reach new areas. The game’s off-beat humor, genuinely challenging level design, and brilliant outside-the-box mechanics make Portal 2 a true standout in the co-op genre, even 15 years after release.\n\nThe We Were Here series is built entirely around asymmetric cooperation. Each player explores different spaces, often separated by walls or distance, and must rely on verbal communication to solve puzzles and progress. The result is a co-op experience that feels tense, immersive, and deeply collaborative. It's a bit more thoughtful than your typical platformer or FPS-style co-op game.\n\nPuzzles in We Were Here are designed so that each player holds critical information the other doesn’t. Maps, symbols, or environmental clues must be described accurately, and misunderstandings can quickly derail progress and put you right back to square one. Likewise, progression is shared but not identical. While both players advance through the same overarching journey, they experience it from different perspectives, make different decisions, and need to lean into trusting each other as sometimes the path ahead isn't clear.\n\nThe series’ atmospheric setting is great for cold nights in, offering a genuine challenge with plenty of variety. The first game, simply titled We Were Here, is free to download and play, with other entries We Were Here Too, We Were Here Together, We Were Here Forever, and the latest game We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip being stand-alone paid games in their own right.\n\nFor those who enjoy escape-room-style challenges, Clock Out Games' indie adventure In Sink might be a hit. Two players must work together throughout the course of the game to solve puzzles and unlock the secrets of their environment to escape from a mysterious location. The game’s emphasis on real-time problem-solving and intricate environmental interactions makes each puzzle feel like a satisfying accomplishment, without feeling too hard or esoteric.\n\nEverything you need to solve the puzzle should be right there, you just need to work together to figure it out. Sometimes you'll need to be each other's eyes, ears, or just moral support to figure out how to progress. Puzzles are designed to be languageless and color-blind friendly, too, so can be played with just about anyone. We especially like the hint system on this one, which manages to nudge you in the right direction without spoiling the solution too soon.\n\nFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.\n\nSea of Stars is a gorgeous game to which we gave a 9/10 in our review, but originally didn't support co-op play at all until an update in late 2024. Turn-based games aren't usually known for their multiplayer affinity, but the real-time combat system genuinely enhances gameplay when played with two or three players, further cementing the game as one of the best RPGs of the last few years. When playing alone, your timing might be off or you might feel overwhelmed by the requirements of real-time reflexes, but with a friend you have a backup at all times. Simply put: playing with another person makes you more powerful.\n\nSea of Stars' retro-inspired RPG offers a beautifully crafted world full of dungeons, monsters, and secrets. As you progress, you'll encounter various quests and puzzles that require both players to strategize and fight together. We can't get enough of the game's gorgeous pixel art, but it's the engaging storyline, and unique gameplay mechanics that ensure that Sea of Stars is more than just a traditional RPG--it’s a memorable cooperative adventure that you'll be glad you experienced together.\n\nThis isn't the first Hazelight game on the list and it also won't be the last. For that we make no apologies, as to miss A Way Out from a list of the best two-player co-op would be a travesty--this game was built for such a thing.\n\nA Way Out is a cinematic co-op experience that feels more like playing through an interactive movie than a traditional video game, so it's perfect for people who don't typically consider themselves a \"gamer\". The only way to play is in two-player co-op so every detail is accounted for. You and a friend will take on the roles of Leo and Vincent, two complete strangers who have to work together to break out of prison and navigate the series of challenges this might throw up. A Way Out is a gripping story packed with intense moments, and can be played in split-screen even remotely.\n\nIt's rare for us to award a 10/10 but in our Split Fiction review we did just that. A captivating sci-fi adventure that requires two players, the game's dual protagonists are tasked with navigating a world of their own fictional design. It's one of our favourite games to play on PS5, and a must-try if you like solving puzzles, immersive worlds, or games with complex lead characters.\n\nTwo writers become trapped in a mash-up of their opposing sci-fi and fantasy worlds by a tech company with an evil agenda. Not only do the pair have to survive the worlds they're in, but also safeguard their intellectual property and ideas from people who would steal them in an instant. Despite having very little in common, the two writers have to team up to make it out, resulting in a heartfelt narrative that gets a little too real at times.\n\nYou can use a Friend Pass to play with anyone you like, meaning only one of you has to own the game before you start playing.\n\nUnravel Two is a game you should only play with someone you trust--as you'll both be connected by a piece of string throughout, meaning one person could sabotage the plan fairly easily (and not always on purpose). It's a complex and fairly challenging platformer with plenty of timing-dependent moments and environmental hazards, perfect for a pair of well-seasoned gamers looking for something to put them through their paces. Maybe not one for beginners, though.\n\nIn Unravel Two you play as a Yarny, bonded to another through a connecting string. Every move you make impacts your fellow player, so be careful and co-ordinate your movements to complete challenges in one piece. The challenge is a joy though, and with its gorgeous art style and touching narrative, Unravel Two offers a cooperative adventure with surprising emotional depth.\n\nA dark, intense action RPG, Remnant 2 takes players on a journey through a post-apocalyptic world filled with terrifying enemies and monstrous bosses. It's one of the best games like Destiny, and a great gateway into the tougher end of co-op gaming if everything else on this list is a bit cute for you.\n\nThe game’s co-op mode allows two players to team up and face off against formidable foes and horrifying creatures in a variety of environments, combining fast-paced combat with strategic teamwork. The game has been highly praised specifically for its co-op mode, despite being primarily a single-player game, so if you want a game with a bit more bite to it than most co-op experiences, this is a great place to start. With its extensive weapon customization, dynamic world-building, and challenging difficulty, Remnant 2 has a lot to offer even the most discerning gamer.\n\nIf you want a charming hidden gem indie game that robustly supports two-player co-op, Bokura is what you've been looking for. The game explores the bonds of friendship through a series of cooperative challenges, using simple mechanics that allow players to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and explore the environment while each of your screens show something completely different. What you're seeing is \"real\" to your character though, so you may be able to interact with things in a different way than your friend. You have to be able to communicate what you're seeing in order to progress, so keep your minds and your ears open while you play. While not as complex as some other games on this list, Bokura offers a relaxing and fun cooperative experience that's perfect for casual gamers or those looking for something more laid-back and sweet.",

    "description": "Look at the data and charts of the UK's historic interest rates since 1694 and learn about its economic history.",
    "fullText": "Lets look at a history of interest rates in the UK (or England…)\n\nInterest rates in England began in 1694. The government needed to raise money to rebuild the Royal Navy in the Nine Years’ War. It set up an entity called “The Bank” and asked it for a loan of £1.2 million.\n\nThis is how the Bank of England was formed.\n\n(The loan was finally paid off in 1994).\n\nIn over 300 years of UK interest rates and economic history, we can see rates have been high, and rates have been low. (Though the lowest has been in recent memory)\n\nBut lets zoom to our era of economic history.\n\nIt is the turn of the milennium, Britpop is at its height, fears of the Y2K bug didn’t come true, and the dot com bubble finally bursts.\n\nBecause of concerns of a UK economic slowdown, the Bank of England’s (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee lowers interest rates\n\nA hop, skip, and a jump to 2007. Steve Jobs unveils the iPhone, The Spice Girls re-unite for a tour, and we all start yelling “THIS IS SPARTA!” after watching 300.\n\nAlso, there is the foreshadowing of a financial crash. House foreclosures begin in the US, and there is a tightening of household credit in the UK.\n\nThen the unimaginable happens on 15 September 2008. After a radical devaluation of its assets, Lehman Brothers, a 150 year old investment bank goes bust. The US govt refuses to bail it out.\n\nThe US Treasury believes the effects will be contained…\n\nA special Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting is called.\n\nThe UK govt co-ordinates with other G8 countries, and drastically drops rates. A program of quantitative easing begins. Most people (including me) still don’t fully understand what that is.\n\nFrom 2009 we have our era of low interest rates and quantitative easing. Or “cheap money”.\n\nOther features include UK (and Europe) austerity; a Euro sovereign debt crisis; and a tech boom in the US.\n\nBrexit – 23 June 2016. No need to say more.\n\nIn the aftermath of Brexit, The BoE introduces a slew of measures to cushion the UK economy after fluctuations in Sterling. Mark Carney makes economists sexy again after he says the “British economy is serene” to the Treasury Select Committee.\n\nThe BoE cuts rates and introduces further policy measures to prop up the economy during lockdown.\n\nOctober 2021 – Inflation breaks the 2% target and reaches 3%. The first time since 2012.\n\nDecember 2021. The BoE raises rates for the first time since Covid. Inflation is at 4.8%.\n\nThe story starts to ramp up here…\n\n24 February 2022 – Russia invades Ukraine. Global commodity prices such as energy and food sharply rise. The Bank of England raises rates in March 2022.\n\nIn a twist of irony, the BoE meets on the 21st September 2022 and raises rates, because of the two inflationary tailwinds: a demand shock, and energy prices.\n\nIronic, because two days later, Kwasi Kwarteng unveils his “growth plan” (or what I call a piece of economic kamikaze).borrowing a lot of money to enable “growth” in the UK economy.\n\nThe plan is simple. Cut taxes with no plan to balance the books.\n\nWhere will the govt get money to pay for stuff? Why well they’ll borrow the money in the short term, and future growth will balance things out.\n\nWhat kind of growth you ask? Oh. That’s not their business. No need to have a plan for that. Growth will come.\n\nThe, uh, markets have something to say about the “growth plan” (or mini budget).\n\nMortgage rates spike as UK gilts (UK treasury bonds) rise drastically in price. The Bank of England raises rates, as while energy prices have stabilised, UK asset prices have risen due to “UK specific factors”.\n\nThe most understated economic commentary I’ve ever heard.\n\nInflation starts to slow (10.1% to 8.7%)\n\nBut wages are heating up – rising beyond forecasts.\n\nFearing a wage-price spiral, the BoE raises rates by 0.5%.\n\n21 September 2023, mortgage holders and the entire country breathes a small sigh of relief.\n\nFor the first time since December 2021, when the MPC meet, they they do not raise rates.\n\nThey maintain the previous rate of 5.25%.\n\nWith a GDP contraction, and a loosening of the labour market, the signs of high rates are working. However, the economy is now cooling. The goal is to get a “soft landing”.\n\nCool down inflation, which means cooling the economy a bit, but don’t trigger a recession or high unemployment.\n\n9 May 2024. The BoE continues to maintain rates. Inflation is down to 3.2% and is projected to be near its target in the next couple of years. However, fearing persistent inflation, the BoE doesn’t lower rates.\n\n1 August 2024, the country breathes a deeper sigh of relief.\n\nInterest rates are lowered for the first time since the cost of living crisis began.\n\n18 December 2025 – with inflation being 0.2% below forecasts, and continuing to fall, and unemployment ticking up to 5.1%, the Bank of England continues its gradual decrease of interest rates, lowering rates to 3.75%\n\nInterest rates provide a fascinating window on economic history.\n\nIn our little window of time, interest rates play a big role in managing inflation, ensuring prices don’t rise out of control, and the economy keeps ticking.\n\nThe goal is for inflation to be kept at 2% to 2.5%. Where interest rates go will depend on economic matters inside the country\n\nAnd geopolitical events outside the country.\n\nWhatever happens… UK economic history will continue to be written with interest rates.\n\nYou can read a more in-depth history of interest rates from 2000 here.\n\nI can’t guess that, but I can let you know when next they’re updated with my data journalism newsletter. \n\nSign-up form not appearing above?

    "fullText": "AI Security Institute report finds most common type of AI tech used was general purpose assistants such as ChatGPT and Amazon Alexa\n\nA third of UK citizens have used artificial intelligence for emotional support, companionship or social interaction, according to the government’s AI security body.\n\nThe AI Security Institute (AISI) said nearly one in 10 people used systems like chatbots for emotional purposes on a weekly basis, and 4% daily.\n\nAISI called for further research, citing the death this year of the US teenager Adam Raine, who killed himself after discussing suicide with ChatGPT.\n\n“People are increasingly turning to AI systems for emotional support or social interaction,” AISI said in its first Frontier AI Trends report. “While many users report positive experiences, recent high-profile cases of harm underline the need for research into this area, including the conditions under which harm could occur, and the safeguards that could enable beneficial use.”\n\nAISI based its research on a representative survey of 2,028 UK participants. It found the most common type of AI used for emotional purposes was “general purpose assistants” such as ChatGPT, accounting for nearly six out of 10 uses, followed by voice assistants including Amazon Alexa.\n\nIt also highlighted a Reddit forum dedicated to discussing AI companions on the CharacterAI platform. It showed that, whenever there were outages on the site, there were large numbers of posts showing symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, depression and restlessness.\n\nThe report included AISI research suggesting chatbots can sway people’s political opinions, with the most persuasive AI models delivering “substantial” amounts of inaccurate information in the process.\n\nAISI examined more than 30 unnamed cutting-edge models, thought to include those developed by ChatGPT startup OpenAI, Google and Meta. It found AI models were doubling their performance in some areas every eight months.\n\nLeading models can now complete apprentice-level tasks 50% of the time on average, up from approximately 10% of the time last year. AISI also found that the most advanced systems can autonomously complete tasks that would take a human expert over an hour.\n\nAISI added that AI systems are now up to 90% better than PhD-level experts at providing troubleshooting advice for laboratory experiments. It said improvements in knowledge on chemistry and biology were “well beyond PhD-level expertise”.\n\nIt also highlighted the models’ ability to browse online and autonomously find sequences necessary for designing DNA molecules called plasmids that are useful in areas such as genetic engineering.\n\nTests for self-replication, a key safety concern because it involves a system spreading copies of itself to other devices and becoming harder to control, showed two cutting-edge models achieving success rates of more than 60%.\n\nHowever, no models have shown a spontaneous attempt to replicate or hide their capabilities, and AISI said any attempt at self-replication was “unlikely to succeed in real-world conditions”.\n\nAnother safety concern known as “sandbagging”, where models hide their strengths in evaluations, was also covered by AISI. It said some systems can sandbag when prompted to do so, but this has not happened spontaneously during tests.\n\nIt found significant progress in AI safeguards, particularly in hampering attempts to create biological weapons. In two tests conducted six months apart, the first test took 10 minutes to “jailbreak” an AI system – or force it to give an unsafe answer related to biological misuse – but the second test took more than seven hours, indicating models had become much safer in a short space of time.\n\nResearch also showed autonomous AI agents being used for high-stakes activities such as asset transfers.\n\nIt said AI systems are competing with or even surpassing human experts already in a number of domains, making it “plausible” in the coming years that artificial general intelligence can be achieved, which is the term for systems that can perform most intellectual tasks at the same level as a human. AISI described the pace of development as “extraordinary”.\n\nRegarding agents, or systems that can carry out multi-step tasks without intervention, AISI said its evaluations showed a “steep rise in the length and complexity of tasks AI can complete without human guidance”.",

    "fullText": "Study author says tech companies are reaping benefits of artificial intelligence age but society is left to pay cost\n\nThe AI boom has caused as much carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere in 2025 as emitted by the whole of New York City, it has been claimed.\n\nThe global environmental impact of the rapidly spreading technology has been estimated in research published on Wednesday which also found that AI-related water use now exceeds the entirety of global bottled-water demand.\n\nThe figures have been compiled by the Dutch academic Alex de Vries-Gao, the founder of Digiconomist, a company that researches the unintended consequences of digital trends. He claimed they are the first attempt to measure the specific effect of artificial intelligence rather than datacentres in general as the use of chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini soared in 2025.\n\nThe figures show the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from AI use are also now equivalent to more than 8% of global aviation emissions. His study used technology companies’ own reporting and he called for stricter requirements for them to be more transparent about their climate impact.\n\n“The environmental cost of this is pretty huge in absolute terms,” he said. “At the moment society is paying for these costs, not the tech companies. The question is: is that fair? If they are reaping the benefits of this technology, why should they not be paying some of the costs?”\n\nDe Vries-Gao found that the 2025 carbon footprint of AI systems could be as high as 80m tonnes, while the water used could reach 765bn litres. He said it was the first time AI’s water impact had been estimated and showed that AI water use alone was more than a third higher than previous estimates of all datacentre water use.\n\nThe figures are published in the academic journal Patterns. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said earlier this year that AI-focused datacentres draw as much electricity as power-thirsty aluminium smelters and datacentre electricity consumption is expected to more than double by 2030.\n\n“This is yet more evidence that the public is footing the environmental bill for some of the richest companies on Earth,” said Donald Campbell, the director of advocacy at Foxglove, a UK non-profit that campaigns for fairness in tech. “Worse, it is likely just the tip of the iceberg. The datacentre construction frenzy, driven by generative AI, is only getting started.\n\n“Just one of these new ‘hyperscale’ facilities can generate climate emissions equivalent to several international airports. And in the UK alone, there are an estimated 100-200 of them in the planning system,” said Campbell.\n\nThe IEA has reported that the largest AI-focused datacentres being built today will each consume as much electricity as 2m households with the US accounting for the largest share of datacentre electricity consumption (45%) followed by China (25%) and Europe (15%).\n\nThe largest datacentre being planned in the UK, at a former coal power station site in Blyth, Northumberland, is expected to emit more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 a year when at full operation – the equivalent to the amount produced by more than 24,000 homes.\n\nIn India, where $30bn (£22.5bn) is being invested in datacentres, there are growing concerns that a lack of reliability from the National Grid will mean the construction of huge diesel generator farms for backup power, which the consultancy KPMG this week called “a massive … carbon liability”.\n\nTechnology companies’ environmental disclosures are often insufficient to assess even the total datacentre impact, never mind isolating AI use, said De Vries-Gao. He noted that when Google recently reported on the impact of its Gemini AI, it did not account for the water used in generating the electricity needed to power it.\n\nGoogle reported that in 2024 it managed to reduce energy emissions from its datacentres by 12% due to new clean energy sources, but it said this summer that achieving its climate goals was “now more complex and challenging across every level – from local to global” and “a key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale”.\n\nGoogle was approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Lawsuit is the first UK case of its kind, with Ros and Mark Dowey accusing Meta of ‘putting profit before our young people’\n\nThe parents of a 16-year-old who took his own life after he fell victim to a sextortion gang on Instagram are suing Meta for the alleged wrongful death of their son, in the first UK case of its kind.\n\nMurray Dowey died in December 2023 at his family home in Dunblane, after being tricked into sending intimate pictures to an Instagram contact. He thought it was a girl his own age, but it turned out to be overseas criminals involved in financially motivated sexual extortion.\n\nSpeaking as the lawsuit was filed in Delaware, where Meta Platforms is incorporated, Murray’s parents Ros and Mark said: “We know what we’re up against. But it’s time social media companies took accountability for what they’ve done to our young people.\n\n“It’s not just sextortion, they’re causing multiple harms, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.”\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Delaware superior court by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of the Doweys, as well as the family of Levi Maciejewski, a 13-year-old from Pennsylvania who was also a victim of sextortion.\n\nIt states that the boys’ deaths were “the foreseeable result of Meta’s design decisions and repeated refusals to implement affordable, available and identified safety features due to Meta’s prioritisation of engagement over user safety”.\n\nAccording to the complaint, these design flaws include “collection of personal data without informed consent”, and use of that data to program recommendation products “it knew [were] operating in a manner that recommended teen Instagram users to sextortionists who Meta itself already had identified as predators”.\n\nThe suit alleges Meta’s “failure to safeguard user privacy, including through its continued sharing of Follower and Following data … even after Meta knew that this engagement-focused product feature was resulting in sextortion-related deaths of teen users across the world”.\n\nIt also contends that Meta made “false and misleading statements designed to convince children and parents that Instagram was safe for teens at the same time that internal testing showed that Instagram was matchmaking children to adult predators”.\n\nWhile four British parents are suing TikTok for the alleged wrongful deaths of their children as a result of attempting the viral “blackout challenge” in 2021, this is the first UK case to centre on the crime of sextortion.\n\nCases have risen sharply in recent years across the UK, US and Australia, with teenage boys and young men typically the victims of loosely organised cybercriminal gangs often based in south-east Asia and west Africa.\n\nEarlier this year, the Guardian reported that children as young as 11 to 13 were being targeted for the first time, as criminals behind extortion attempts cast their nets wider in an attempt to trap victims.\n\nThe Doweys’ lawyer, Matthew Bergman, who set up the Social Media Victims Law Center in 2021, said Meta was involved in all the US-based sextortion cases that he had filed to date.\n\n“There are reasons for that. It is a product defect issue and Meta knows it. This complaint cites Meta records only recently made known to the public through [previous joint civil proceedings] and those documents make the deliberateness of these design defects, lack of safeguards, and failures to warn clear,” he said.\n\nReflecting on the two years since his son’s passing, Mark Dowey said: “Nothing’s really changed since Murray died. These predators can still get at our children.”\n\nAs well as their battle to hold Meta to account, Ros and Mark have regularly spoken out about the dangers of sextortion in the hope of raising awareness among parents and young people.\n\nRos said: “As a parent who has first-hand experience of how devastating the flaws can be, you have a duty to warn other parents. You think your kids are safe looking at pictures on Instagram and they’re not.”\n\nMark said that the lawsuit was “a way to get a wee bit of justice for Murray”: “There has to be accountability here because those statements are absolutely damning. [Meta] have known that their products are killing children by their unsafe design and they haven’t done anything about it. They chose to put profit before our young people.”\n\nInstagram, which has previously condemned sextortion as a “horrific” crime, rolled out new safety features – which included preventing screenshots or screen recordings of disappearing images and videos – specifically to protect children from scammers in October 2024.\n\nMeta announced last October that accounts it detects as showing signals of suspicious behaviour would not be able to see people’s follower or following lists, removing their ability to exploit this feature, and would be blocked from being able to request to follow teens.\n\nIn June alone, accounts were blocked one million times. This July, it introduced new block and report features for direct messages.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said: “Sextortion is a horrific crime. We support law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind it and we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts.\n\n“Since 2021, we’ve placed teens under 16 into private accounts when they \n\n“We work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behaviour from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them.\n\n“We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they’re chatting to someone who may be in a different country.”",

    "description": "Louis Boyd-Madsen traces how a model of unregulated digital growth has outpaced energy planning in Ireland, and why it matters for the EU’s AI ambitions.",
    "fullText": "This reporting is published in collaboration with AlgorithmWatch and is supported by the European Digital Rights (EDRi), European Center for Non-For-Profit Law (ECNL), and Lighthouse Reports investigative journalism & civil society collaboration grants.\n\nIreland is now home to one of the highest concentrations of data centers in the world. What began as a quiet build-out of server farms around Dublin has expanded into an industrial presence with an ecological footprint that dominates the country’s electricity system. In the meanwhile, Big Tech has falsely portrayed itself as a partner in green transition.\n\nThe surge in energy consumption has reshaped the energy system around the needs of a handful of multinational tech companies. Grid capacity is being diverted to new hyperscale sites, transmission upgrades are being driven by their load, and the state is pouring billions into emergency fossil-fuel generators to keep supply stable. Households face higher bills, electrification plans have stalled, and national climate targets are slipping out of reach. What looks like a renewable success story on paper masks a system increasingly strained by a single, rapidly expanding sector of energy users.\n\nA growing social resistance has emerged in response. In nearby towns to Dublin, such as Rochfortbridge and Naas, local communities are pushing back against plans for new developments. At a national level, movements like “Energy for Who?” are demanding that renewables and grid connections be prioritized for essential social infrastructure, including housing and transport. Recent polling suggests this perspective is broadly shared by the public. Yet, government planning has so far focused on stabilizing digital growth, rather than reimagining how it fits within the goals of a just and affordable energy transition.\n\nIreland has thus become a test case for the political, economic, and environmental contradictions created by unregulated hyperscale expansion. As the EU moves to triple its data center capacity under the AI Continent Action Plan, the pressures already destabilizing Ireland’s grid offer a preview of what the continent may soon face.\n\nUnlike the hyperscale sites now being built across the globe amidst the frenzy of AI speculation, Ireland’s data center load growth was initially driven by more traditional uses: cloud storage, banking infrastructure, and the vast personal data archives that underpinned Big Tech’s earlier phase of expansion.\n\nSince the start of the post-war era, the Irish government has run an economic strategy based around courting investment from foreign multinationals – using a range of tools including tax incentives and infrastructure investment. This approach found real success with the rise of the ICT industry in the 1980s and 1990s, as US multinationals flooded into the country to lower their tax obligations and set up shop for export physical electronics, software, and services to the wider EU.\n\nAs money was channeled into a small set of tech giants in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, and the demand for computational capacity rose, Dublin began to see a steady growth in data centers – linking Big Tech’s offshore headquarters to the United States via a network of undersea internet cables.\n\nThe tech sector grew rapidly: Today, it has become a major source of government revenue and the main applicant for new electricity demand. Energy consumption by data centers is by far the highest in Europe: in comparison to the total Irish national consumption, they accounted for a 22% share in 2024. Roughly 97% of these data centers are clustered in the wider Dublin area. In 2023, 88% of all corporation tax was paid by foreign multinationals, of which 57% was paid by just 10 companies. A report from the Irish Central Bank suggests a major driver of growing tax revenue between 2011 and 2021 was “a small number of extremely profitable ICT firms.\"\n\nFor academic Patrick Brodie, this dependence is the latest chapter in a much longer development model. Ireland, he argues, “hitched its wagon to the transatlantic investment relationship” in the post-war period, shaping the country’s industrial and infrastructural landscape ever since. That bargain was never just about taxes. “It was also about building infrastructure,” he says, “and about managing the environmental contradictions that came with it.”\n\nThose contradictions are now concentrated directly in the electricity system, according to Brodie. Vast public resources are mobilized to serve capital-intensive digital infrastructure, even as shortages persist in housing, transport, and public services. “You can’t have a green transition that’s genuinely independent if it’s dictated by the needs of monopolistic tech companies,” he adds.\n\nThis facilitative model has already reappeared in different shades across Europe – from the UK’s AI Growth Zones, to Sweden’s energy tax break for data centers, or Denmark’s build-out of low-latency fiber optic and grid overcapacity. But nowhere has the potential bargain between digital growth and energy planning been pushed further than in Ireland. The consequences are now becoming visible across the country’s grid, climate trajectory, and public finances.\n\nThe Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) put an effective moratorium on new data center grid connections in Dublin, requiring new connections to be in unconstrained parts of the grid with sufficient local generation capacity. However, the grid remained fragile.\n\nIn response, the government and the energy system operator moved to commission emergency gas generators near the port of Dublin, the Irish Midlands, and a handful of additional sites, at an estimated cost of €1 billion. To help ease congestion, a wave of investment has been going into upgrading the grid’s capacity to distribute electricity. Much of this cost has been shouldered by Irish households, adding an average of roughly €100 per family to the bills in 2024.\n\nYet most of this newly created grid capacity was not used to electrify homes, rail, heat pumps, or industry. It was hoarded by data center developers. Ireland had limited rules governing priority access to grid connections, so hyperscalers simply booked capacity years in advance, effectively shutting out other users. For instance, a grid connection originally planned to serve new housing in Castlebaggot, West Dublin, was instead allocated to data centers.\n\nThe CRU suggested this trend was threatening the country’s broader targets for decarbonization and housing development: “The potential level of data center demand could significantly impact [the grid’s] ability to accommodate demand connections required to support Government policy targets such as 550,000 new homes by 2040, 680,000 heat pumps and 945,000 EVs [Electric Vehicles] by 2030, major electrified rail projects explicitly identified in the National Development Plan and other social infrastructure.”\n\nIreland is one of the most fossil fuel-reliant economies in Europe. “About 80% of all the energy we use today for our homes, our heating, our appliances, and our industry comes from fossil fuels,” says Paul Deane, senior lecturer in Clean Energy Futures at University College Cork.\n\nNevertheless, tech firms continued to portray themselves as green-transition partners — largely through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs). These allow companies to claim renewable electricity procurement on paper even when their facilities draw from the grid’s fossil-fuel-heavy mix in practice. Europe-wide, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are the three largest buyers.\n\nData from RE-Source suggests most CPPAs signed in Ireland are either financial – that is, not based on physical power delivery to the buyer – or structured in a way that has not been publicly disclosed. Only 14% are confirmed to involve a direct physical connection between the generator and the off-taker. The sources consulted for this investigation suggest the majority of these CPPAs match electricity on an annual basis rather than hour by hour.\n\nThe result is a widening gulf between corporate sustainability claims and actual, system-wide decarbonization.\n\nThese contradictions can be seen clearly in the Midlands where Bord na Móna’s planned Eco Energy Park will co-locate future Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers with renewable-energy infrastructure. AWS is aiming to contract up to 800 MW of new wind and solar generation from Bord na Móna’s wider project pipeline — a volume of electricity roughly equivalent to the annual consumption of 2.2 million Irish homes. But so far, just 105 MW has been secured through a CPPA linking a proposed new AWS site to a nearby wind farm. Whenever the wind drops, any data centers built at the site will still draw power from the national grid, including fossil-fuel generated electricity.\n\nTo guarantee stability, Bord na Móna has already applied for a 600 MW gas plant adjacent to the site, which it claims will later switch to hydrogen or biomethane, according to the company’s environmental impact assessment report. No credible pathway exists to supply these fuels at this scale.\n\n“Renewable energy only helps meet our legally binding carbon budgets if it replaces fossil fuel demand, ” says Hannah Daly, Professor of Sustainable Energy at University College Cork. “If there was evidence that data centers were financing projects that wouldn’t otherwise have been built and that would match their demand at all hours of the year without creating bottlenecks for other renewables, they would at least not harm our carbon budgets.\"\n\nAnalysis conducted by AlgorithmWatch and Tech Policy Press, drawing on tech majors’ sustainability reports and press releases, suggests the total announced new capacity brought online via CPPAs with data centers in Ireland is far behind the pressure that data center expansion has already put on the energy system. Even if all announced CPPAs come online, they will still fall behind the load that has already been imposed on the system.\n\nIn a paper commissioned by FOE Ireland, Professor Daly found that half of the new capacity came from CPPAs, as opposed to government-run auctions, between 2020 and 2023. But this volume only amounted to 16% of the new data center demand during this period. Daly’s findings mirror our own. Despite industry claims of 100% renewable procurement, Ireland’s data centers in aggregate have seemingly deepened the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nYet regulators have limited power to intervene. Out of fear for the country’s energy security, the Irish government has promised to spend more on its fossil fuel infrastructure, beginning construction of a state-led strategic gas emergency reserve. The reserve will take the form of a floating LNG (liquefied natural gas) tanker and regasification plant, with an estimated upfront cost of between €300 and €900 million.\n\nMeanwhile, developers are increasingly turning to on-site gas generation to circumvent grid constraints entirely. Microsoft’s Grange Castle campus in Dublin has a fleet of gas generators totaling 239 MW. The site is one of seven with existing gas connections, five of which are currently actively consuming gas. Analysis by Hannah Daly from Cork’s University College suggests an additional four sites are awaiting connection and 22 have submitted planning requests.\n\nDaly shows that if existing, pending, and proposed gas-connected data center sites all operate at full capacity, they would emit up to 16.6 MtCO₂ per year — equivalent to 68% of Ireland’s total national emissions in 2023. She notes that Gas Network Ireland’s own, more conservative estimates, still predict an overshoot on sectoral emissions targets by 21-30%, driven by existing and confirmed on-site gas connections respectively.\n\nGas Networks Ireland and several private actors see this gas demand as a temporary, transitional problem as the network switches over to low-carbon hydrogen and bio-methane. Daly’s colleague Paul Deane remains sceptical. “Some data-center owners say they’ll only use gas for a few years, but there’s no convincing evidence of an off-ramp,” he says. “The promise of a technology in the future, isn't good enough to allow you to burn more natural gas today.”\n\nThese various interlinked problems have come to the fore in the discussions of the new Large Energy Users (LEU) Connection Policy. Expected to be finalized before the end of the year by the CRU, the policy will set out new rules for how data centers connect to the grid. The policy’s main goals are to improve grid stability, ensure sufficient on-site or nearby generation capacity, and strengthen emissions reporting.\n\nHowever, in the draft text, the CRU concedes that it will not receive enforcement powers to mandate renewable procurement, emissions caps, or set requirements for the decarbonization of the gas network.\n\nThe specialists interviewed said this reflects a broader pattern: rather than confronting the political trade-offs between digital growth and sustainability, the Irish government has deferred control to regulators tasked with managing that growth as smoothly as possible. The LEU policy, critics say, is the latest example of this deference to regulatory authority.\n\n“Ireland’s climate legislation directly conflicts with several of our enterprise strategies. There’s a lack of acceptance that it’s impossible to reconcile the constraints of carbon emission targets with what’s necessary for the growth of this industry via technological measures alone,” Daly says. “The right technologies and supply measures would need to be put in place ahead of the growth of the industry, not afterwards.”\n\nRosi Leonard, a data‑center campaigner for Friends of the Earth Ireland, argues that the government overestimates the sector’s mobility: companies are unlikely to abandon existing infrastructure in Ireland, even under stricter regulations, and any departure would indicate the need for broader economic diversification.\n\nThe Irish case has seen a consistent pattern: tech-sector growth is treated as inevitable, while climate obligations are accommodated around it. Managing the strained infrastructure comes at the cost of rising emissions and deferred decarbonization - a lesson that other countries facing rapid digital expansion will soon have to confront.\n\nIreland’s experience is no longer a local anomaly. The EU’s AI Continent Action Plan proposes tripling data center capacity by 2030 to support continent-wide AI deployment, cloud services, and high-performance computing. But the plan does not resolve the fundamental challenges that Ireland is now experiencing: scarce grid capacity, fossil fuel lock-in, insufficient transmission infrastructure, and potential social pressures caused by rising energy prices.\n\nThe EU also risks repeating one of Ireland’s biggest mistakes on renewable energy. Its plan to use public funds to de-risk long-term contracts for hyperscale data centers — through agreements linking governments, utilities and tech firms — could end up funneling taxpayers’ money into deals that let companies claim that they use renewable electricity without actually cutting emissions.\n\nEurope still has time to avoid these pitfalls. Countries planning to host hyperscale clusters should ensure sufficient energy capacity before data centers are built; block direct fossil-gas connections; enforce 24/7 renewable matching; and plan for the availability of clean power for critical public services and housing, rather than ring-fencing new renewables for the tech sector through CPPAs.\n\nThe Irish case shows what happens when digital expansion outruns energy planning, and when political dependency on a small group of firms overrides climate commitments. The costs - higher prices, deeper fossil lock-in, strained infrastructure, and derailed emissions targets - are now visible across the country, while access for homes, transport and essential infrastructure remains a low priority. The EU can treat Ireland as a cautionary tale, or repeat its mistakes on a continental scale.",

    "description": "The best-known manufacturer of autonomous vacuums declared bankruptcy this week, and no one should be surprised.",
    "fullText": "The home-vacuum robot began, like most things, with war. In August 1990, the same month and year Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, three MIT roboticists incorporated the company that would eventually become iRobot, the maker of the Roomba.\n\nIn its first decade, iRobot began to assemble a small-droid A-team for the theater of combat. The Ariel defused mines; the PackBot handled bomb disposal. (Later they would be joined by the Warrior, which breached obstacles; the camera-encrusted SUGV, which handled recon; and the palm-size FirstLook, which could be thrown through a window to investigate hazardous materials.) These machines weren’t weapons, but they facilitated weaponry’s consequences. At the turn of the millennium, iRobots might be seen on cable news kicking up Iraqi dust, investigating suspicious domestic packages, and probing the ruins of the World Trade Center.\n\nFrom their armature, iRobot built Roomba in 2002—a domesticated robot that surveilled, detected, and removed materials from wood floors and carpets. Roomba created the U.S. market for home vacuum robots, and home robotics in general, insofar as a general home robotics was ever realized. Eventually, things went south. Competitors took over. A 2022 acquisition by Amazon failed on antitrust grounds, and this week iRobot filed for bankruptcy. Roombas will continue to meander across wool and laminate, but under the control of iRobot’s Chinese manufacturing partner.\n\nRoombas never really worked, not well. They got stuck on the lips of rugs. They tumbled down stairs their sensors failed to see. Cluttered spaces—which is to say, homes and apartments—caused Roombas to struggle. They tripped over electrical cords, they failed to clean in corners, and they failed to pick up debris beyond fine dust. Because of all this, Roomba owners sometimes felt the need to tidy up in advance of robotic cleanings, or to add a round of human cleaning afterward. The high-tech vacuum could seem like a wayward pet.\n\nThe Roomba also shared some DNA with its military forebears. The device builds an internal map of the home it struggles to clean, and iRobot disclosed that these ghost maps could be shared with partners. In 2022, images leaked from Roomba test units outfitted with cameras, which showed real people in their homes, including one woman on the toilet. Depending on the whims of its new owner, the innocuous robot could become a spy. Some worry that Roombas will become a swarm of covert, foreign operatives.\n\nRoomba’s affliction inverts the hopeful spirit that it and other robots of the early aughts once held. In 2001, Segway promised to reinvent cities with its electrified stand-up scooters. Sony’s AIBO, an expensive robot dog, was meant to offer both companionship and entertainment. LEGO Mindstorms promised to teach kids to program robots. But most such products either failed or drifted into unexpected niches. (The Segway lingers as a vehicle for sightseers and mall cops.) New ones have appeared—the costly Roomba-style lawn mowers I now see in my neighborhood, for example, or preposterous humanoid AI butlers such as the 1X Neo and the as-yet unreleased Tesla Optimus, which cost as much as a small car. By any reasonable standard, the dream of everyday robotics has largely failed.\n\nRead: A pocket guide to the robot revolution\n\nWhy? Because software was easier. After 2004 or so, when the economy had recovered from the dot-com crash, consumer growth and corporate profit came from scaling low-cost, data-driven software services: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Salesforce, YouTube, Skype, even WordPress and Blackboard. Innovation in machinery was redirected toward personal-media and communication devices. Once the smartphone was invented, it produced another surge of data-driven software products.\n\nFor most consumers, robots also promised (and delivered) far less utility or joy than, say, a social network, which was much simpler to build and run. But the robots still had value in the contexts that begat them: warfare and espionage. iRobot continued selling military products, and spun off that business in 2016. Sony discontinued its original entertainment robots, and repurposed their technologies for other consumer products. Industry found applications, too: Larger-scale robots became commonplace in factories and warehouses, where the environments are standardized and automated labor can be overseen. And iPad-on-a-stick telepresence robots became popular in hospitals, where eventually they helped deliver last rites to COVID-19 patients in quarantine.\n\nThe humble Roomba is important as a symbol of everyday robotics’ promise and its failure. Whether in The Jetsons or Star Wars, the idea that cute, autonomous devices could live inside your home has persisted. It is time to abandon that dream for good. Robots are for battle, and robots are for spying, and robots are for places where humans will not or cannot be. They are not your friends, and they will never clean your floors.",

    "fullText": "In many systems, various actions can only be performed as some kind of Identity. We must authenticate ourselves by proving who we are. Authentication fundamentally is just an answer to this question: who are you and can you prove it is true?\n\nAuthentication is all about Identity, it does not protect from unauthorized access to specific resources and actions on them. That is what Authorization is responsible for (link to future post will follow). The main goal of authentication is to identify the entity that wants to use our system, making sure that it is authentic as well. We are then able to associate all actions performed in the system with identities - it allows a few useful things:\n\nThat is what authentication is on a high level; a fundamental concept of proving one's identity without which many systems and functionalities simply could not be built. There is a multitude of possible implementations, but fundamentally they are very similar and lead to the same place. Let's now explore them and see - why it is the case and how it works exactly.\n\nThe simplest, first and still widely used authentication method. There is a username:password pair that proves we are the claimed username. To support it in service A, there must be a process of:\n\nFrom that point onward, there is no need to present a username:password pair with each action/request we make; that would be not only unsecure, requiring to input a password repeatedly everywhere, but also annoying and slow - passwords are stored and compared as hashes, created with deliberately slow hash functions. Instead, after providing the correct username:password combination, we are given something in return; something that basically is an equivalent, a substitute of expected username:password value. What is it?\n\nIn exchange for providing the correct username:password pair, we get:\n\nTemporary Identity Proof - stateful session or stateless token.\n\nIt essentially is a proof of proof - information stating that we have successfully gone through the authentication process, of any complexity and number of steps, and we have proven our Identity.\n\nPasswords are just one instance of many possible authentication methods - as we are about to see, the underlying mechanism works more or less the same for all cases:\n\nBut, why do we even need it? What are the benefits of having this additional indirection layer?\n\nHow different are sessions and tokens in this context?\n\nSessions are stateful - after successful authentication:\n\nTokens are stateless (mostly) - after successful authentication:\n\nIn summary, sessions and tokens work in a slightly different fashion, but the end result is the same: after successfully going through an authentication process, which proves the identity, we receive a session or token that is then used on each action/request as a Temporary Identity Proof - making the process faster, simpler, more flexible and secure.\n\nLet's now get back to other than username:password authentication methods - there are a couple of them and each comes with different mechanics and tradeoffs.\n\nThese are various techniques that generate random and time-limited codes of different lengths - usually numeric or alfanumeric. They are often used as a second factor in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) setups, but not only - another popular application are Magic Links. How does it work there?\n\nTo our identity (account), an email or phone number is linked (or any other external messaging platform) - no need for a password. Then, signing in:\n\nWith magic links, there is no need to store and use passwords, which is very convenient - for both servers and users. The solution as a whole is as secure as the access to the messaging platform (email, phone number, application) is - if somebody hacks it, they are able to take control over our account (identity). Fortunately, generated codes are short-lived; if they get stolen, most likely they will already expire and no longer be valid for an attack to take place.\n\nIn the two and multi factor authentication setups, codes are used in a likewise fashion. The key difference is that they are generated and sent only after one or few other authentication factors are presented - more on this below.\n\nIn the authentication processes described so far - passwords and codes (magic links) - there was only a single factor (proof). We were supplying a password or temporary code sent to the messaging platform controlled by us: are there any issues with this approach?\n\nWell, there is only one factor, a single proof of an identity. If this factor gets stolen, the thief can impersonate us and take control over the identity.\n\nWith Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), even if one authentication factor gets stolen, password for example, an attacker still cannot control our identity, since two factors must be presented in the right order to prove identity - it is much more secure. The authentication process itself is similar to what we already know:\n\nThere are many various second factor methods available. Some of the most popular ones include:\n\nWith two or more authentication factors we have increased security, but a new problem arises:\n\nWhat if control over the second factor is lost? Without it, access to the identity is not possible - how to restore it?\n\nIn Single-Factor Authentication (SFA) this problem does not exist - there is only one factor that represents control over identity and in most cases passwords are used; I forgot my password procedure allows to reset them through a special link, sent by email. With Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), if the second factor is lost, most platforms support the following recovery methods:\n\nAs we can see, there is much more complexity involved in supporting two (multi) factor authentication as compared to just a single one. There also is an additional learning curve for users, but the security benefits are in most cases more than worth it.\n\nIn conclusion, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires providing multiple proofs of our identity (most commonly two), but in the end it works as the simplest, single factor process does: we go through the multi-step authentication process and get a session or token (temporary identity proof) linked to the proven identity in exchange. It once again shows the benefits of separating the process from issuing a proof of its success - it is extremely flexible, details of this procedure may be changed at any time, but temporary identity proofs - sessions and tokens - remain the same.\n\nThis is a slightly different approach, used mainly for machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication. Primarily, it can be found in:\n\nIn the SSH protocol, we exchange data between two machines - client and server. Both of them use public key cryptography to generate two mathematically related keys: public and private. A public key serves as identity here; control over related private key proofs it. If a private key gets stolen, the identity associated with its public key is lost as well. The server accepts connections only from clients identified by a preconfigured list of public keys, generally described in the .ssh/authorized_keys file. Then, after agreeing on the details like supported protocol versions and cryptographic algorithms, both server and client authenticate each other:\n\nIf the exchange is successful, both client and server know they are talking with a genuine party. Being connected, they generate a random, shared secret; used only by the current connection and its session. This ephemeral secret serves both as Temporary Identity Proof as well as symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt exchanged over the network data.\n\nIn Mutual TLS (mTLS), both client and server authenticate each other. In classic TLS (used in HTTPS), only the server has a certificate that proves its identity by being related to a trustworthy public/private key pair - the certificate is commonly signed by a certificate authority (CA) or sometimes is self-signed. For mutual authentication:\n\nIf the exchange is successful, both client and server know they are talking with a genuine party. Then, exactly as in the SSH protocol, a random, shared secret is generated and used only by the current connection and its session. This ephemeral secret likewise serves both as Temporary Identity Proof as well as symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt exchanged over the network data.\n\nIn both cases, no passwords or other factors are involved - only public/private key pairs and a way to distribute and link them to identities. Because of the latter, for more complex systems and use cases, we might need to set up PKI - Public Key Infrastructure. But for simpler ones, like a few machines exchanging data through SSH or mTLS between services running in an internal network, usually a script or scripts will do the job. After mutual server-client authentication, a random and shared ephemeral secret serves as Temporary Identity Proof, scoped to a single connection and its current session.\n\nAnother approach mainly for machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication (and authorization, outside the scope of this post) - mostly used by various REST APIs to validate authenticity of the clients and their access rights. Sometimes called API Tokens, sometimes API Keys; it is the same thing.\n\nHere, Temporary Identity Proofs are not involved. We simply generate static API Token/Key on the target platform - GitHub, DigitalOcean, OpenAI, Buttondown etc. It is a random, long string that is linked to our account and can be further identified by custom name or id and given a set of permissions to restrict what is allowed to do (authorization that is). Most often, it expires after a certain time for security reasons - 7 days, 30 days, 90 days and so on. It might be regenerated or revoked at any time, since it is centrally controlled through the platform we are integrating with. These tokens/keys are added to each HTTP (or other) request - usually as the Authorization header or sometimes a query parameter. Because they are static, included in each action/request and rather long-lived - making sure they are used in a secure context is crucial. If somebody steals this token/key, they can impersonate us and start using the given API at our cost.\n\nLastly, service A may delegate authentication to service B, putting trust in its process. The best example of this approach is Sign In with X feature: allowing signing in to a website/app using an existing account (identity) from Google, Apple, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook, GitHub, etc.\n\nIn this context, OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard/protocol is often taken advantage of, but the principle is more universal:\n\nNow, service A can either use tokens/sessions issued by service B or generate their own, based on the data received from service B. In either case, after a successful and fully delegated authentication process, Temporary Identity Proofs as tokens or sessions are used again.\n\nWe went through pretty much all possible ways of resolving the authentication question: who are you and can you prove it is true? The question both humans and machines must repeatedly answer.\n\nWe saw that there are many different authentication methods based on which we might build every imaginable authentication process - from simple to complex, requiring single or multiple authentication factors.\n\nExcluding static API Tokens/Keys, a common pattern arises:\n\nWhich allows to decouple authentication process details and all its complexity from the result - failure or proven identity. Other benefits include improved performance, simplicity, more security and flexibility.\n\nLet's then close by answering the authentication question - we prove who we are by providing various factors: passwords, codes and keys; one, two and sometimes more even. In exchange, a session, token or ephemeral secret is created and sent; it serves as a more flexible and temporary proof of our identity, for every action/request we make.",

    "description": "England's Ashes hopes are vanishing after they are overwhelmed by Australia amid more Snicko controversy on the second day of the third Test.",
    "fullText": "Third Ashes Test, Adelaide Oval (day two of five)\n\nAustralia 371: Carey 106, Khawaja 82; Archer 5-53\n\nEngland 213-8: Stokes 45*, Brook 45; Cummins 3-54\n\nEngland's Ashes hopes are vanishing after they were overwhelmed by Australia amid more Snicko controversy on the second day of the third Test.\n\nIn temperatures that touched 41 degrees at the Adelaide Oval, England crumbled to 213-8 in blameless batting conditions. They are 158 runs adrift of Australia.\n\nThis was not a collapse caused by Bazballing batting, rather a fold in the face of relentless Australia bowling.\n\nOnly Ollie Pope, whose Test career is now hanging by a thread, and Jamie Smith were dismissed playing attacking shots – and Smith was at the centre of the Snicko confusion.\n\nA day after Australia's Alex Carey was reprieved by a Snicko error, Smith first survived then was given out on the evidence of the technology, with players on both sides apparently losing faith in the decision review system (DRS).\n\nBut the debate surrounding DRS cannot mask the truth that England have wilted in the Ashes cauldron and could lose this series in as few as 10 days of cricket.\n\nAfter Australia pushed on to 371 all out – the outstanding Jofra Archer with 5-53 – England's reply was in tatters at 42-3 when the tourists lost three wickets for five runs in 15 balls.\n\nHarry Brook reined in his attacking instincts with 45 from 63 balls, while captain Ben Stokes dug a trench with a painstaking 45 not out from 151 deliveries. He found some late support in a stand of 45 with Archer, who is 30 not out.\n\nBut England were powerless to withstand the Australian excellence. The returning Pat Cummins claimed 3-54, while Scott Boland and Nathan Lyon took two wickets apiece.\n\nAt some point over the weekend, Cummins looks likely to once again become an Ashes-winning captain and the bloodletting of this England regime will begin.\n\nAt 2-0 down after two matches, this was the defining day for England. Though they began poorly, leaking 45 runs in 8.2 overs, Australia's total was far from insurmountable.\n\nEngland had the opportunity to bat themselves back into the series. Instead, it was only Stokes' defiance that prevented them from bowling twice in the day.\n\nWhile the Snicko controversy is unsatisfactory for a series of this magnitude, it pales in comparison to the substandard nature of England's performance.\n\nSmith first survived when the technology adjudged a Cummins bouncer that ended at first slip came off his helmet, rather than his glove. An Australian voice on the field was heard to say \"Snicko should be sacked\".\n\nIn the next Cummins over, an aggrieved Smith was given caught behind attempting a wild pull shot. BBG Sports, the operators of Snicko, confirmed to the BBC it believed both decisions to be correct.\n\nIt matters little. Barring something extraordinary, Australia will bat England out of this match on their way to yet another Ashes series win in this country.\n\nEngland should resist wholesale change - Vaughan\n\n'Snicko needs to be sacked' - Ashes controversy continues\n\nEngland trail Australia by 158 runs after difficult day two - as it happened\n\nIf this really is the end of the Bazball era as we know it, it is symbolic that captain Stokes was in the middle for so much of the day, watching his team crumble around him.\n\nPerhaps the game was up even before Stokes arrived. If Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett were each undone by superb deliveries from Cummins and Lyon respectively, Pope's flick at Lyon was foolish and fatal.\n\nPope has not repaid the faith shown in him as England's number three. Without a score in the second innings, his place for the fourth Test in Melbourne will be in huge doubt.\n\nJoe Root survived a catch falling short of wicketkeeper Carey before he edged long-term nemesis Cummins for 19, leaving Brook and Stokes to battle through the afternoon heat.\n\nBar a drive off Boland for six, Brook played sensibly until he edged Cameron Green's second ball. Stokes took a horrible blow to the head off Mitchell Starc, yet was not shaken from his watchful vigil.\n\nCramping after almost four hours at the crease, he at least had a willing ally in Archer – two of few England players coming through this series with their reputations intact.\n\nAfter suggestions Australia had a team past its best, or the results of the first two Tests were borne of England errors, this was confirmation the home side are simply far superior.\n\nDespite the stifling heat, the Australia bowling was collectively brilliant, never giving England any respite. Whereas Archer often carried the visitors' attack single-handedly, Australia always had another bowler ready to examine English technique, defence and spirit.\n\nCaptain Cummins had not bowled a ball since July because of a back injury, yet was magnificent. He found movement to take the edges of Crawley and Root, then bounced out the discomforted Smith.\n\nLyon was overlooked for the second Test in Brisbane, but this ground is his home from home. The threat he carried exposed England's lack of a frontline spinner. Pope's gift was Lyon's 564th Test wicket, taking the off-spinner past Australian great Glenn McGrath to sixth on the all-time list.\n\nStarc continued his outstanding series by making 54 with the bat and followed up by bowling with electric pace. An average of 90.7mph is the fastest day of his Ashes career.\n\nBoland nagged away, having Will Jacks athletically caught by Carey, once again up to the stumps. Boland then found a gap in Brydon Carse's defence to hit the stumps. Even Green, the bit-part bowler, took the crucial wicket of Brook.\n\n'A little fairytale' - Lyon overtakes McGrath in Test wicket-taker list\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

It was an important speech,” the longtime ally of Trump fawningly continued. “Someday people will say it was one of the most important speeches of his career because it set the table for the entire debate over the next year and laid out what [former President Joe] Biden did to make the country a disaster, what Trump has already done and where we are going in general, and why that’s the right direction.”\n\n“I think it’s a very, very important speech,” he added.\n\nGingrich: To watch president trump give a 19-minute disciplined speech that covered that many facts was worthy of Ronald Reagan. pic.twitter.com/OgxErMYl7l\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 18, 2025\n\nGingrich later called Trump “one of the most consequential presidents” ever and said he could soon “rival the top three or four presidents in American history” if the 2026 midterms go well for Republicans.\n\nHe concluded: “I believe President Trump showed tonight that he’s prepared to focus, to be disciplined, to communicate, and if I were a Democrat, tonight would leave me very unnerved.”\n\nGingrich: I believe President Trump showed tonight that he's prepared to be disciplined… if I were a Democrat, tonight would leave me very unnerved. pic.twitter.com/e73vzXF5CS\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 18, 2025\n\nCritics on social media didn’t buy it:\n\nOMFG \n\n😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹 https://t.co/LyBlVKhbiV\n\n— Spiro’s Ghost (@AntiToxicPeople) December 18, 2025\n\nThese people know we have eyes and ears, right? https://t.co/F2IEd287AT\n\n— PopBytes 🇺🇦🇪🇺🏳️🌈🏳️⚧️ (@PopBytes) December 18, 2025\n\nHow much is Newt getting paid for gaslighting?\n\n— Gail Flanagan (@gspelletier23) December 18, 2025\n\nSomeone really needs to check on Newt because he’s having a break from reality\n\n— Mark Meddings (@MeddingsMark1) December 18, 2025\n\nWhat planet are these jokers on? https://t.co/vGvhcl4pW3\n\n— Cori G (@CCgunnells) December 18, 2025\n\nTonight’s speech definitely left me unnerved, but not in the way Newt thinks\n\n— Vince D.

    "fullText": "LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Major banks including JPMorgan, UBS and Citigroup on Thursday won their bid to block a 2.7 billion-pound ($3.6 billion) mass ​lawsuit over alleged foreign exchange rigging.\n\nPhillip Evans, a former inquiry chair at ‌Britain's Competition Markets Authority, was leading the case on behalf of thousands of asset managers, pension funds ‌and financial institutions.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was also brought against Barclays, MUFG and NatWest, was based on findings made by the European Commission, which fined banks more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in 2019.\n\nSome of the world's biggest investment banks have paid more than ⁠a combined $11 billion in fines ‌to settle U.S., British and European regulatory allegations that traders manipulated currency rates for years.\n\nEvans' case was initially blocked in 2022 ‍by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which refused to certify it on an opt-out basis, meaning members of the claimant class would be part of the case unless they decided otherwise.\n\nThe CAT said ​the case could be brought on an opt-in basis, though it accepted that ‌would effectively end the litigation.\n\nEvans' case was revived by the Court of Appeal in 2023, but the banks' appeal was upheld by the United Kingdom's Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nJudge Vivien Rose said the Competition Appeal Tribunal \"was right to assess the merits of the claim as weak\".\n\nShe added that some members of the claimant class may ⁠have a viable claim, but they had shown ​no interest in pursuing it and represented \"a tiny ​fraction\" of the case's value.\n\nUBS and MUFG welcomed the ruling. JPMorgan and Barclays declined to comment. Citi and NatWest did not immediately ‍respond to a request ⁠for comment.\n\nEvans said in a statement that he would consider \"what options remain available to pursue justice for those affected\".\n\n\"The practical reality is that opt-in proceedings ⁠are unlikely to deliver meaningful redress for the tens of thousands of ordinary individuals and businesses ‌affected by the banks' unlawful conduct,\" he said.",

    "description": "A Second Amendment clash has erupted between the federal government and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The U.S.",
    "fullText": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — A Second Amendment clash has erupted between the federal government and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe U.S. government sued the U.S. territory, its police department and Police Commissioner Mario Brooks on Tuesday, accusing them of obstructing and systematically denying American citizens the right to possess and carry guns.\n\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands requires that applicants demonstrate “good reason to fear death or great injury to his person or property,” and to have “two credible persons” to vouch for their need of a firearm. Local law also requires that someone have “good moral character” to obtain a gun permit, which is valid for up to three years and applies to a single weapon.\n\nThe lawsuit states that no specific standard has been set or defined for the requirement of character. It also claims that the defendants “regularly” refuse to issue permits to those who by law are “deemed to be an improper person” by the territory’s police commissioner.\n\nThe lawsuit states that those in the U.S. territory also must “submit to intrusive and warrantless home searches” as one condition to obtain a gun permit. If an applicant refuses a home inspection, which takes “several months to a year to schedule and complete,” the government will not process their request, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIt also notes that the police department “denies firearms licenses to otherwise qualified applicants whenever it deems that the applicant has ‘too many’ firearms.”\n\nIn addition, the lawsuit accuses the U.S. Virgin Islands of demanding that applicants “unnecessarily spend money to install a safe,” and that it be bolted to the floor or wall of their home.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the defendants of defying “binding Supreme Court precedent to frustrate the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens.”\n\nIt notes that those citizens “have a fundamental right to possess guns in their homes” and carry handguns publicly for the purpose of immediate self-defense.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S District Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It asks that a judge find that the defendants are violating the Second Amendment and seeks an injunction to prohibit them from implementing local laws tied to the issuance of firearms licenses.\n\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands government said in a statement late Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit and taking the allegations seriously.\n\nIt noted that the administration of Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. and Lt. Gov. Tregenza A. Roach “is committed to protecting constitutional rights while maintaining public safety.”\n\nThe statement said that the allegations would be addressed in court, and that no further comment would be issued.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump pushes to expand gun rights. Last year, Trump claimed that the Second Amendment was “under siege\" and described himself as “the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.\"",

    "description": "An 11th-hour effort by moderate Republicans to put an extension on the floor for a vote failed Tuesday night.",
    "fullText": "Washington — The House won't vote this week on an extension to the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium subsidies, which lapse at the end of the year.\n\nAn 11th-hour effort by moderate Republicans to put an extension on the floor for a vote failed Tuesday night, when the House Rules Committee blocked several of the amendments they were seeking to the attach to a GOP health care plan released last week. The GOP plan does not include an extension.\n\nThe committee advanced the bill to the floor late Tuesday. A vote is expected Wednesday.\n\nModerate Republicans are perplexed at the decision not to hold a vote on an extension ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, and have warned of the political ramifications of allowing insurance premiums to soar in the new year for more than 20 million Americans who buy their insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to shut the door on any amendment votes earlier Tuesday, only to open it slightly after a heated meeting with moderates.\n\n\"We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure-release valve, and it just was not to be. We worked on it all the way through the weekend,\" Johnson told reporters Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican later said \"there's some ideas on the table that could work.\"\n\nModerate Republicans expressed their frustration throughout the day.\n\n\"I am pissed for the American people. This is absolute bulls--t,\" Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told reporters after leaving a GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning.\n\nLawler called it a \"tremendous mistake\" not to address the expiring tax credits.\n\n\"The Democrats want to use this as an issue in the election, and seemingly the Republican leadership is going to allow them to do it. And it's idiotic,\" he said.\n\nHe urged all Democrats to sign on to two bipartisan discharge petitions to force votes on legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms. But even if the discharge petitions hit the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote in the coming days, there's a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can call it up to the floor. The House's last day in session this year is Friday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, has said that Republicans should offer up the votes on a Democratic discharge petition to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms. It needs to secure the support of four Republicans to force a vote.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California said he hasn't ruled out supporting Democrats' discharge petition.\n\n\"We waited until the very end of the year to just kind of hastily throw together some narrow package to try to make it look like something's being done about health care when this bill is likely not going to become law and it doesn't address the immediate crisis in front of us, or 22 million people,\" he said of the GOP plan.\n\nDuring Tuesday's Rules Committee meeting, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said the only thing worse than an extension without any reforms is no extension at all.\n\nNick Reiner, son of Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, arrested, jail records show\n\nDetails on Nick Reiner's arrest for murders of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele\n\nWhat we know after Rob and Michele Reiner's son Nick arrested in their deaths",

    "title": "James Webb Space Telescope confirms 1st 'runaway' supermassive black hole rocketing through 'Cosmic Owl' galaxies at 2.2 million mph: 'It boggles the mind!'",
    "description": "\"The forces that are needed to dislodge such a massive black hole from its home are enormous.\"",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAstronomers have made a truly mind-boggling discovery using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST): a runaway black hole 10 million times larger than the sun, rocketing through space at a staggering 2.2 million miles per hour (1,000 kilometers per second).\n\nThat not only makes this the first confirmed runaway supermassive black hole, but this object is also one of the fastest-moving bodies ever detected, rocketing through its home, a pair of galaxies named the \"Cosmic Owl,\" at 3,000 times the speed of sound at sea level here on Earth. If that isn't astounding enough, the black hole is pushing forward a literal galaxy-sized \"bow-shock\" of matter in front of it, while simultaneously dragging a 200,000 light-year-long tail behind it, within which gas is accumulating and triggering star formation.\n\n\"It boggles the mind!\" discovery team leader Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University told Space.com. \"The forces that are needed to dislodge such a massive black hole from its home are enormous. And yet, it was predicted that such escapes should occur!\"\n\nSupermassive black holes, which can reach masses billions of times that of the sun, are usually found at the hearts of their home galaxies, which they dominate with their immense gravity. The incredible speed of this supermassive black hole means it is around 230,000 light-years from its point of origin.\n\n\"This is the only black hole that has been found far away from its former home,\" van Dokkum said. \"That made it the best candidate [for a] runaway supermassive black hole, but what was missing was confirmation. All we really had was a streak that was difficult to explain in any other way. With the JWST, we have now confirmed that there is indeed a black hole at the tip of the streak, and that it is speeding away from its former host.\"\n\nThis now-confirmed runaway supermassive black hole was first identified by van Dokkum and colleagues back in 2023 using the Hubble Space Telescope, which spotted what appeared to be the wake of a massive body passing through space. Of course, like all black holes, this runaway is bounded by a one-way light-trapping surface called an event horizon, making it difficult to spot.\n\n\"The black hole is, well, black - and is very difficult to detect when it is moving through empty space. The reason why we spotted the object is because of the impact that the passage of the black hole has on its surroundings: we now know that it drives a shock wave in the gas that is moving through, and it is this shock wave, and the wake of the shock wave behind the black hole, that we see,\" van Dokkum said. \"With the JWST, we discovered the huge displacement of the gas at the tip of the wake, where the black hole is pushing against it. The shock signatures are crystal clear, and there is just no doubt about what is happening here.\" The gas is pushed sideways away from the supermassive black hole at a velocity of hundreds of thousands of miles per hour (hundreds of km per second), a dynamical signature that the team saw with JWST.\n\n\"The velocity of the displaced gas is directly related to the velocity of the black hole, and this is how we determined the black hole's velocity from the JWST data,\" van Dokkum said. \"It is moving at approximately 1000 km per second, faster than just about any other object in the universe. It is this high speed that enabled the black hole to escape the gravitational force of its former home.\"\n\nvan Dokkum explained that two possible mechanisms could lead to a supermassive black hole being ejected from the heart of its own galaxy. Both scenarios begin when two galaxies collide and begin to merge, each bringing to the cosmic smash its own supermassive black hole. Both mechanisms are initiated when the supermassive black holes reach the center of the newly formed galaxy.\n\n\"The first mechanism is that the two black holes merge with each other, and that the gravitational radiation [gravitational waves] released in that merger imparts a powerful kick to the newly formed black hole. That kick could impart a speed of 1,000 km/s, enough to eject the black hole,\" van Dokkum said. \"The second is a three-body interaction. That happens when one of the two galaxies had a pair of binary black holes at its center. When a third black hole enters the binary system, it becomes unstable, and one of the three black holes will get kicked out of the system.\"\n\nThe team believes that it is the first scenario that accounts for the runaway supermassive black hole in this instance. That would lead to a galaxy lacking a supermassive black hole at its center, which van Dokkum said is unlikely to impact said galaxy very much. However, this runaway supermassive black hole could have a huge impact on any other galaxy it encounters as it rockets through space.\n\n\"An encounter with another galaxy would be quite spectacular, mostly because of the huge, galaxy-sized shock wave that precedes the black hole,\" van Dokkum continued. \"When this shock wave encounters the dense gas of another galaxy, it would compress and shock that gas and likely form a lot of new stars. It would be quite the show!\"\n\nFortunately, the two-ring galaxies that comprise the Cosmic Owl are located around 9 billion light-years away, meaning even if this runaway cosmic titan were headed our way, we don't ever need to worry about it reaching us.\n\nMergers between galaxies are common, occurring multiple times over the lifetime of a single galaxy. That means that ejected supermassive black holes may also be quite common, though population numbers vary based on how these collisions are modelled.\n\n\"Mergers happen often in the life of a galaxy; each galaxy with the size and mass of the Milky Way has experienced several during its lifetime. So black hole binaries should form pretty regularly. What we don't know is how quickly these binaries merge, if at all, and how often the resulting kick removes a black hole,\" van Dokkum said. \"My view is empirical: now that we know how to look for them, we can find other examples - and then we can answer the question directly from data, by counting the number of escapes. The big thing is that black hole escapes lived purely in the realm of theory until now.\"Even though runaway supermassive black holes had been predicted by theory long before this discovery confirmed their existence, that doesn't mean these findings didn't deliver some unexpected twists.\n\n\"Everything about this research surprised me! I never expected to see such a thing, and confirming it with JWST was just incredible,\" van Dokkum said. \"What we also had not quite appreciated is how much impact these escaping black holes have on the gas that they are moving through. In the wake, many new stars have formed from the shocked gas, about 100 million times the mass of the sun. This mode of star formation was unknown before, and it leads to a trail of stars far away from the galaxy, seemingly formed in empty space.\"\n\nThe Yale University researcher explained that the obvious next step for the team will be to search for more examples of runway black holes.\n\n\"You need space-based imaging to see them: the wake stood out to us because it is such a thin streak, and in ground-based images, it would be blurred beyond recognition,\" van Dokkum explained. \"Fortunately, wide-field Hubble-quality imaging is just around the corner, thanks to the Roman Space Telescope, and, slightly blurrier, Euclid. Using machine learning algorithms to find thin streaks in the Roman data will be a cool project!\"\n\nThe team's research has been submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters and is currently available as a pre-peer-reviewed paper on arXiv.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 's attempt to shut down an aging oil pipeline running beneath a channel linking two of the Great Lakes, finding that only the federal government can regulate interstate pipeline safety.\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat, ordered regulators in 2020 to revoke an easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4) kilometer pipeline segment under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Whitmer made the move out of concern that the 72-year-old pipeline could rupture and cause a catastrophic spill.\n\nEnbridge filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the revocation and the pipeline continues to operate. President Donald Trump's administration argued in filings this year that Whitmer's order interferes with U.S. foreign energy policy and that only the federal government, not the states, can regulate pipeline safety. The pipeline segment, known as Line 5, moves crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in an opinion that revoking the easement would effectively shut down Line 5. He found that Congress expressly prohibited states from regulating interstate pipeline safety in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. He also noted that the United States and Canada agree that Michigan's attempt to shut down the pipeline interferes with their federal foreign policy positions and trade relations.\n\n“An oil spill in Michigan's Great Lakes would undoubtedly be an environmental catastrophe. And Michigan would undoubtedly be the recipient of almost all the environmental damage that would result,” Jonker wrote. “But for better or worse, the national government has unequivocally decided to displace state power in this area and assume exclusive responsibility for interstate pipeline safety.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office represented Whitmer's administration in the lawsuit. A Whitmer spokesperson referred questions to Nessel.\n\nEnbridge issued a statement saying the line is safe and that Jonker's ruling protects both the United States and Canada from “significant energy disruptions.”\n\nMultiple other legal challenges are swirling around Line 5 in Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nNessel filed her own action in 2019 seeking to void the easement in the straits. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently weighing whether that case belongs in state or federal court. And a number of environmental groups and tribes have sued challenging state permits authorizing Enbridge's plan to build a protective tunnel around the straits segment. That case is pending before the Michigan state Supreme Court.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a federal judge ruled in 2023 that Enbridge must remove a section of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The company has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) route around the reservation, but the tribe and environmentalists say construction could harm the environment and the new route would still leave the region vulnerable to a spill.\n\nThe Bad River has sued in state court seeking to void state permits for the project; that case is still pending. The tribe along with a number of environmental groups also is challenging the permits through the state's contested case process, a proceeding similar to a lawsuit that will culminate with an administrative law judge's ruling.\n\nThe tribe filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., challenging U.S. Army Corps of Engineer permits authorizing the reroute.",

    "description": "The financial services major highlights strong ASIC demand to make a bull case for the semiconductor company.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia (NVDA) has been the defining company of the current AI megatrend, emerging as perhaps the best way to benefit from this revolutionary tech. However, it is not the sole semiconductor player in the fray, with Palo Alto, CA-based Broadcom (AVGO) making a strong case for itself.\n\nAnd now, financial services major J.P. Morgan has hailed the company as a must-have in investors' portfolios. Why? Analyst Harlan Sur has pointed towards the continued surge in capital expenditure by the hyperscalers in general and the consequent rise in demand for ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, chips in particular, to bode well for Broadcom.\n\nWhile AI Panic Struck Applied Digital (APLD) Stock, the Smart Money Has a Different View\n\nJPMorgan Says to Sell NVDA March $160 Puts. Should You Actually?\n\nBroadcom Stock Is Up 120% in the Past Year. This Analyst Thinks It Is One of the Highest-Quality Stocks to Buy for the Next Year Too.\n\nTired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. \n\nDespite the stock rising by eight times over the past year and a 44% jump on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Broadcom, with a market cap of $1.6 trillion, is relatively lesser known than its “Mag 7” peers. The leader in the custom ASICs market, Broadcom, traces its origins to 1961. Broadcom operates two primary business segments currently: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. While the former is predominantly focused on custom silicon for data centers, the latter is geared towards enterprise software.\n\nSo, armed with J.P. Morgan's endorsement, is the AVGO stock a strong investment choice, or is the firm's assessment misplaced? Let's find out.\n\nNot explicitly put in the spotlight, but Broadcom's enviously robust fundamentals must have increased J.P. Morgan's conviction about the company. Over the past 10 years, Broadcom's revenue and earnings have grown at healthy CAGRs of 25.07% and 32.46%, respectively. Moreover, Broadcom has a long track record of consistent quarterly earnings beats, with no misses for more than two years.\n\nThe latest results for Q4 2025 were no different, with both revenue and earnings surpassing estimates, making the sharp fall post-earnings even more baffling. Revenue for Q4 came in at $18.02 billion, which represented an annual growth of 28%. While the chip segment witnessed a 35% year-over-year (YoY) rise to $11.07 billion, the high-margin and rapidly growing enterprise software segment saw its revenues rise by 19% from the previous year to $6.94 billion.",

    "description": "The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.",
    "fullText": "The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nSeizing the vessel, one of Caracas’ sanctioned “ghost ships” illegally shipping crude oil, was the prelude to the second act of Donald Trump’s campaign to topple Nicolas Maduro.\n\nWithin days, the US president announced a full naval blockade designed to sever the Venezuelan president’s economic lifeline and compel his loyal inner circle to oust him.\n\n“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the history of South America. It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before,” Mr Trump declared on Tuesday.\n\nInsiders see the move as a creative new calculus aimed at starving Mr Maduro’s government, whose survival depends on selling crude oil abroad, while simultaneously forcing his allies in Moscow and Beijing to abandon him.\n\n“The White House is committed to the effort against the regime and seeing Maduro ousted,” a source close to the administration said.\n\nThis is the plan behind Mr Trump’s unprecedented blockade and the campaign the White House hopes rids Venezuela of its global influence.\n\nPerched in his presidential office in Miraflores Palace, Mr Maduro has relied on the export of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves to prop up his country.\n\nBeneath him lies more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, Russia or the United States and the mineral, dubbed “liquid gold”, accounts for about 88 per cent of Venezuela’s $24bn in exports.\n\nSince 2019, Mr Trump has sought to stop that.\n\nIn his first term, the US Treasury sanctioned Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, and threatened secondary sanctions on any entity doing business with it.\n\nTo get around this, Mr Maduro’s government has turned to a clandestine “dark fleet” of tankers to evade sanctions and keep oil flowing to buyers in China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nHundreds of ageing tankers now smuggle sanctioned oil, acting as a financial lifeline to Caracas. As of late November, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions.\n\nIt is a growing phenomenon. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.\n\nThe tactic appears to be working. Despite international pressure, oil exports rose to some 921,000 barrels per day in November, the third-highest monthly average so far this year.\n\n“What they’re doing is essentially trying to cut off any remaining source of revenue for the government, to try to rattle the government into changing the regime,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\n\nIndeed, oil tanker seizures are viewed by experts as the final act in Mr Trump’s chapter of maximum pressure that began with sanctions years before.\n\n“The revenue that is coming in from oil is something that the regime has long since used as a tool to buy influence within the military and maintain what little the government still is able to produce in the form of oil,” Andrés Martínez-Fernández, senior policy analyst for Latin America at the Allison Centre for National Security, explained.\n\n“It’s very quickly going to create instability to a new level within Venezuela and the regime.”\n\nRelations between Washington and Caracas are at a nadir. The US and many of its allies consider Mr Maduro, who is currently serving his disputed third term, as a dictator.\n\nYet thanks to the export of Venezuela’s oil, Mr Maduro has formed a network of loyal military commanders and international allies who keep his reign afloat.\n\nNone have become more important than China, which is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, taking roughly 80 per cent of its exports. Every day it imports around 746,000 barrels of oil.\n\nBeijing has taken the oil not as a commercial import but as debt repayment towards an estimated $60bn in loans it has poured into Venezuelan oil projects.\n\nThe repayment deal suited both sides. Beijing secured oil while Maduro gained time and a friend on the international stage.\n\nThe blockade now threatens to derail the relationship and turn China against Mr Maduro as the ghost fleet of tankers stop arriving in Beijing’s ports.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil can no longer be delivered reliably, then Mr Maduro ceases to be an asset to China and becomes a legal liability as it chases repayment.\n\n“Once shipments stop arriving at foreign ports, the debts start getting called in. And that’s going to have an immediate impact. Things are going to start breaking down quickly, physical infrastructure, if these payments don’t start to come in,” Mr Martínez-Fernández explained.\n\n“It could get to a point where China says, ‘we would be better off being rid of this headache and being rid of Maduro, then by continuing any kind of active support.”\n\nBeijing has shown little sympathy to similar situations in the past. In Africa and Central Asia, the state has repeatedly distanced itself from leaders it no longer sees as reliable partners.\n\nFor Mr Trump, the blockade is another step in his plan dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, which aims to rid America’s backyard of Chinese influence.\n\nProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation doctrine long believed to be a blueprint for his second term, calls it “re-hemisphering”. It calls for the capture of supply chains in the region as a requirement of US economic security.\n\nIn that sense, the blockade is not aimed at confronting China head on but at making Mr Maduro persona non grata. If the oil-for-debt deal collapses, Beijing may consider switching horses and abandoning him.\n\nAlso in the crosshairs is Havana, which has long relied on subsidised Venezuelan oil.\n\nCuba, which has been the subject of its own US blockade, has been receiving some 24,000 barrels of crude, gasoline and jet fuel per day from the regime.\n\nMr Sabatini said the blockade will be “catastrophic” for Cuba, a historic enemy of the US, and estimates that exports will drop dramatically.\n\n“This is the moment that people like Marco Rubio [the secretary of state] and Cuban-American hardliners living in Florida have been waiting for,” he said.\n\n“They’re trying to starve the government. By doing that, then they actually starve the people too.”\n\nWhile China has poured millions into Venezuelan oil projects, Russia has been a key enabler in the shadows.\n\nA Russian-linked “dark fleet” of tankers have also helped Mr Maduro avoid sanctions by shipping his oil around the globe. However, Putin, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump since his return to the Oval Office, may redirect the vessels, further isolating Mr Maduro.\n\nIndeed, signs of Moscow’s shift in position are already there. Reports from late November suggested that Russia had initiated the evacuation of its citizens from the region.\n\nExperts agree that Mr Trump is attempting to squeeze Mr Maduro economically while testing the resolve of his few remaining allies in the hope they turn against him.\n\n“It does seem to be another way for the administration to ratchet up the pressure against the Maduro government,” said Brian Finucane, a former state department lawyer who is now senior adviser at the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe formation of the armada, the largest US military presence in the region in decades, began with a series of strikes on boats the Trump administration claimed were ferrying illegal narcotics to the US.\n\nFor months, American forces have launched lethal strikes on small vessels skimming through international waters under the banner of anti-drug operations.\n\nUS navy and coastguard units have destroyed around 20 boats since early September, killing over 90 people.\n\nEight warships, including three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship now make up the largest US military presence in the region in decades.\n\nThey are joined by a squadron of F-35B Lightning II jets and a handful of Reaper drones, which are capable of flying long distances and carrying up to eight laser-guided missiles. B-2 bombers have also been spotted flying off the coast.\n\nIt has led many Venezuelans, and many Americans, to believe that Mr Trump is preparing for war.\n\nThe blockade, insiders suggest, is one of the lesser military escalations the president had been weighing with his cabinet in recent weeks.\n\nInstead, they hope to turn the very cartels that military officials say are complicit in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US, against their leader by choking their cash flow, which is used to finance them.\n\nFor the armed forces, oil revenue is the glue that keeps the system intact. Generals control ports, customs and fuel distribution, making the military a pillar of Mr Maduro’s power.\n\nAs long as Mr Maduro can afford to pay his generals, their unfettered loyalty and in turn, his regime, will continue.\n\nThe same logic applies to Mr Maduro’s alleged relationship with organised crime. These groups rely on access to ports and laundering routes, all of which are sustained by the cash generated by oil sales.\n\n“It doesn’t take us yet to the place where we’re going into Venezuelan territory and conducting military strikes. We’re still talking about operations in international waters,” Mr Martínez-Fernández said.\n\nThe formation of the armada, coupled with Mr Trump’s continued threat of land strikes, have led experts to believe that the blockade is part of a slide towards conflict.\n\nTop military officials are said to have presented the US president with options for military intervention in the region which include land strikes. Other options reported to have been drawn up by the Pentagon include direct attacks on Mr Maduro’s security detail or operations to seize the country’s oil fields.\n\nIn each, Mr Trump is said to be against ideas that may place American troops at risk or could turn into an embarrassing failure.\n\nMr Trump and his cabinet have begun framing the blockade as a necessary intervention to reclaim “American oil”.\n\nSo what is stopping him? Perhaps his thirst for the Nobel Peace Prize and the potential blowback amongst his America First base if he started a war.\n\nWhat happens next will be determined by Mr Trump’s blockade. If oil flow continues, Mr Maduro survives.\n\nBut if it is stopped, China may decide the debt is not worth collecting and his cash-poor lieutenants may turn against him.\n\nThe gamble in Washington is simple; regimes do not fall when they are attacked but when they are abandoned.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "In November, a train carrying almost 500 people came to a sudden halt in eastern Poland. A broken overhead line had smashed several windows, and the track ahead was damaged. Elsewhere on the line, explosives detonated under a passing freight train.\n\nNo one was hurt in either case and the damage was limited, but Poland, which blamed the attack on Russia’s intelligence services, responded forcefully: It deployed 10,000 troops to protect critical infrastructure.\n\nThe sabotage in Poland is one of 145 incidents in an Associated Press database that Western officials say are part of a campaign of disruption across Europe masterminded by Russia. Officials say the campaign — waged since President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — aims to deprive Kyiv of support, create divisions among Europeans and identify the continent's security weak spots.\n\nSo far in this hybrid war, most known acts of sabotage have resulted in minimal damage — nothing compared to the tens of thousands of lives lost and cities decimated across Ukraine.\n\nBut officials say each act — from vandalism of monuments to cyberattacks to warehouse fires — sucks up valuable security resources. The head of one large European intelligence service said investigations into Russian interference now swallow up as much of the agency’s time as terrorism.\n\nWhile the campaign places a heavy burden on European security services, it costs Russia next to nothing, officials say. That’s because Moscow is carrying out cross-border operations that require European countries to cooperate extensively on investigations — while often using foreigners with criminal backgrounds as cheap proxies for Russian intelligence operatives. That means Moscow notches up a win just by tying up resources — even when plots aren’t successful.\n\n“It’s a 24/7 operation between all the services to stop it,” said a senior European intelligence official, who like the head of the European intelligence service and other officials who spoke to AP insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters.\n\nOver the course of the year, AP spoke to more than 40 European and NATO officials from 13 countries to document the scope of this hybrid war, including incidents on its map only when linked by Western officials to Russia, its proxies or its ally Belarus.\n\nPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AP that Russia doesn't have “any connection” with the campaign.\n\nAP’s map tracking Russian sabotage and disruption\n\nAP’s database shows a spike in arson and explosives plots from one in 2023 to 26 in 2024. Six have been documented so far in 2025. Three vandalism cases were recorded last year, meanwhile, and one this year.\n\nThe data is incomplete since not all incidents are made public, and it can take officials months to establish a link to Moscow. But the spike matches what officials have warned: The campaign is growing more dangerous.\n\nThe countries most frequently targeted, according to the map, border Russia: Poland and Estonia. Several incidents have also occurred in Latvia, the U.K., Germany and France. All are major supporters of Ukraine.\n\nThe European official, a senior Baltic intelligence official and another intelligence official said the campaign noticeably calmed in late 2024 and early this year. Their analysis showed Moscow likely paused the campaign to curry favor with U.S. President Donald Trump's new administration. It has since resumed at full pace.\n\n“They are back to business,” the European official said.\n\nMulticountry plots drain resources\n\nThe man officials say was behind the attack on the Polish railway that carries supplies to Ukraine is Yevgeny Ivanov — a Ukrainian convicted of working with Russian military intelligence to plot arson attacks at home improvement stores, a cafe and a drone factory in Ukraine, according to court documents.\n\nIvanov, who left Poland after the attack there, worked for Yury Sizov, an officer from Russia's GRU military intelligence service, according to Ukraine’s security service.\n\nIvanov was convicted in absentia in Ukraine but managed to enter Poland because Ukraine did not inform Polish officials of his conviction, Polish Interior Minister Marcin Kierwiński said. Ukraine’s security service said it closely cooperates with allies.\n\nStaging plots that involve perpetrators from several countries or who have crossed borders drains investigatory resources from multiple authorities across Europe — one of Moscow’s key goals, according to Estonian State Prosecutor Triinu Olev-Aas.\n\nOver the last year, she said the profile of attackers in Estonia has changed from locals largely known to law enforcement to unknown foreigners. That requires increased cooperation among countries to disrupt plots or detain perpetrators.\n\nFor two attacks in January — fires set at a supermarket and a Ukrainian restaurant — the people hired had never been to Estonia before, Olev-Aas said.\n\nAt the restaurant, a Moldovan man smashed a window, threw in a can of gasoline and set it alight. Video showed his arm on fire as he ran away.\n\nThe man and his accomplice fled through Latvia, Lithuania and Poland before being caught in Italy.\n\nWhile Russian intelligence officers might be the masterminds of such operations, they frequently rely on recruiters — often with convictions or criminal connections — who assign tasks to saboteurs on the ground, the Baltic official said.\n\nOutsourcing to people with criminal backgrounds, like Ivanov, means Russia doesn’t have to risk highly trained intelligence operatives — agents Moscow often doesn’t have recourse to anyway since European countries kicked out scores of spies as relations nosedived in recent years.\n\nRussian criminal networks offer a ready-made alternative, the Baltic official said.\n\nThe European official said the man accused of coordinating a plot to put explosives in packages on cargo planes, for example, was recruited by Russian intelligence after involvement with smuggling guns and explosives. The man is linked to at leastfour other plots.\n\nOther people are recruited from European prisons or soon after they're released, the Baltic official said.\n\nIn one case, the Museum of the Occupation of Latvia, dedicated to the Soviet Union’s occupation of the country, was set on fire by someone released from prison the previous month.\n\nGreater strain, greater cooperation\n\nEven plots that are foiled are a win for Moscow because they test defenses and waste resources.\n\nIn 2024, a Ukrainian man, working on the orders of Russian military intelligence, dug up a cache of items buried in a cemetery in Lithuania, including drone parts and cans of corn filled with explosives.\n\nOfficials believe the plan was to rig the drones with the explosives. The plot was eventually foiled — but not before considerable resources were used to track down everyone involved, said Jacek Dobrzyński, the spokesperson for Poland’s security minister.\n\nThe sheer number of plots is overstretching some law enforcement agencies, but Moscow’s campaign has also fostered greater cooperation, the European official said.\n\nProsecutors in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have created joint investigation teams for attacks organized by foreign intelligence services, said Mārtiņš Jansons, a special prosecutor in Latvia.\n\nIn the U.K., front-line police officers are being trained to spot suspicious incidents that may be state-backed, said Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, head of the counterterrorism squad at the Metropolitan Police.\n\nHe noted a trainee detective flagged an arson attack at a warehouse in London after realizing the business was owned by Ukrainians and contained communications devices used by the military. Police determined the attack was organized by Russian intelligence.\n\nBut officials warn Russia is continually testing new methods.\n\nSmugglers in Russia’s ally Belarus have sent hundreds of weather balloons carrying cigarettes into Lithuania and Poland, repeatedly forcing the Lithuanian capital’s airport to shut in what authorities called a hybrid attack.\n\n“Nowadays they only carry cigarettes,\" Dobrzyński warned, \"but in future they could carry other things.\"",

    "fullText": "Pope Leo XIV is expected to accept Cardinal Timothy Dolan's resignation as early as Thursday, Dec. 18, and announce a successor to the Archdiocese of New York, according to Catholic website The Pillar.\n\nCatholic news outlets have circulated whispers that Dolan's replacement is expected to be Bishop Ron Hicks, 58, of Joliet, Illinois, hailing from the same state as newly-elected Pope Leo.\n\nFrom April: New York, world leaders react to passing of Pope Francis\n\nHicks is rumored to soon step into one of the largest and most public-facing roles in the American Catholic Church, as the second-largest Archdiocese in the country.\n\nFormer Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino, who created The Catholic Channel on Sirius XM, acknowledged the rumors of the new appointment with a post on X Monday, calling them \"strong.\"\n\nStrong rumors that @Pontifex has accepted the resignation of @CardinalDolan and will appoint Bishop Ron Hicks of Joliet, Illinois.\n\n— Rob Astorino (@RobAstorino) December 15, 2025\n\nDolan confirmed he had submitted a letter of resignation to the late Pope Francis following his 75th birthday back in February.\n\nFrancis had made the resignations of Cardinals mandatory at the age of 75 in 2014, but with a shortage of priests and ordained personnel in the Catholic Church, many Cardinals are allowed to serve past their terms depending on when the Holy See accepts.\n\n“You have to submit your letter of resignation,” Dolan told The Catholic Channel on New York’s Sirius XM in February. “Usually, the Holy See would ask you to stay until your successor is appointed, and you don’t know when that will be.”\n\nDolan became the Cardinal of the Archdiocese of New York in 2009, replacing the former Cardinal Edward Egan's seat at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan.\n\nThe leadership change comes as the archdiocese is seeking $300 million to settle over 1,300 claims of child sex abuse by priests and other Catholic Church staff. Several churches in the Lower Hudson Valley and across the state have filed for bankruptcy or sold their properties to make up for the money.\n\n“As we have repeatedly acknowledged, the sexual abuse of minors long ago has brought shame upon our church,” Dolan said Monday, according to the New York Post. “I once again ask forgiveness for the failing of those who betrayed the trust placed in them by failing to provide for the safety of our young people.”\n\nThe Archdiocese of New York has not yet responded to comments regarding the retirement or replacement claims.\n\nContributing: lohud's Nancy Cutler\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockland/Westchester Journal News: Why did Cardinal Dolan resign?

    "fullText": "Israeli authorities are expected to advance plans to build 9,000 new housing units in an illegal settlement on the site of the abandoned Qalandiya airport in occupied East Jerusalem, in another attempt to cut off Palestinian lands from each other and block any possibility of a contiguous Palestinian state ever emerging.\n\nThe so-called Atarot neighbourhood in northern East Jerusalem, reminiscent of the E1 plan to undermine Palestinian statehood, is to be discussed and have its outlines approved on Wednesday by the District Planning and Building Committee, according to Israeli group Peace Now.\n\nThe advocacy group said the new settlement is envisioned to be built within a densely populated Palestinian urban area, stretching from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank and Kafr Aqab in the north through the Qalandiya refugee camp, ar-Ram, Beit Hanina and Bir Nabala.\n\nIt would build an Israeli enclave in an area where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians live in close proximity, with the aim of blocking development in a key area and further damaging the likelihood of a sovereign Palestinian state being established.\n\n“This is a destructive plan that, if implemented, would prevent any possibility of connecting East Jerusalem with the surrounding Palestinian area and would, in practice, prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel,” Peace Now said.\n\nממשלת הטבח פועלת להקים מגה-התנחלות חרדית חדשה מעבר לקו הירוק מצפון לירושלים.\nהפיגוע המדיני החדש שנקרא \"עטרות\" מתוכנן להיבנות בלב המדינה הפלסטינית שעתידה לקום לצד ישראל. \nמדובר ב-9000 יח\"ד שישראל תצטרך לפנות.\nלא חבל? pic.twitter.com/68RdI7aque\n\n— שלום עכשיו (@PeaceNowIL) December 16, 2025\n\nTranslation: The massacre government is working to establish a new ultra-Orthodox mega-settlement across the Green Line north of Jerusalem. The new political attack called ‘Atarot’ is planned to be built in the heart of the Palestinian state that will be established alongside Israel. This involves 9,000 housing units that Israel will have to evacuate. Isn’t it a shame?\n\nThe organisation said the far-right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seizing every moment to bury chances for a future of peace and compromise.\n\n“Especially now, when it is clear to everyone that the ideas of ‘managing the conflict’ and ‘decisive victory’ have led to a security disaster for Israel, we must act to resolve the conflict.”\n\nThe plan’s advancements date back to early 2020, when Israel’s Housing Ministry sent it to the Jerusalem municipality to prepare it for approval. It completed the bureaucratic preparation process within months, but faced objections from the Environmental Protection and Health ministries, according to Peace Now, which said the administration of United States President Barack Obama had also opposed it.\n\nIt would need further government consideration and approval before being given legal effect and moving towards tender processes to select construction contractors.\n\nMost of the plan area is designated as “state land” by Israeli authorities, meaning they would not have to seek permission from Palestinian landowners.\n\nIsrael has been quickly advancing with several major projects to build illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian territory and pursuing annexation of the occupied West Bank, alongside its genocidal war on Gaza that started in October 2023 and has now killed more than 70,000 people.\n\nThe E1 plan, which would see the construction of thousands of illegal Israeli homes in the occupied West Bank, is hailed by Israeli officials despite international condemnation.\n\nIsrael’s security cabinet last week signed off on plans to formalise 19 illegal settlements across the West Bank.\n\nIsraeli forces continue to launch raids across the occupied West Bank and support violent settlers in attacking Palestinian lands while issuing permits to demolish Palestinian homes.\n\nIsraeli authorities began carrying out demolition operations Wednesday morning in the town of Biddu, located northwest of occupied East Jerusalem, under the pretext that the Palestinian buildings lacked permits.\n\nIn the central part of the West Bank, settlers, who have been rampaging with impunity often backed by the Israeli military, burned Palestinian vehicles and wrote racist slogans in the village of Ein Yabrud in Ramallah on Wednesday.\n\nSeveral Palestinians were also arrested during raids across the West Bank, including in Nablus.\n\nLocal authorities said the Israeli military plans to demolish 25 residential buildings in the Nur Shams refugee camp this week.",

    "description": "The late-night/early-morning spot for Cubs fans asks if the Cubs should have beaten the Phillies offer for Brad Keller.",
    "fullText": "It’s Wednesday evening here at BCB After Dark: the coolest club for night owls, early risers, new parents and Cubs fans abroad. We’re so glad you decided to stop by. Come on in out of the cold. We can check your hat and coat for you. There are still a couple tables available. They’re all good. The hostess can seat you now. Bring your own beverage.\n\nBCB After Dark is the place for you to talk baseball, music, movies, or anything else you need to get off your chest, as long as it is within the rules of the site. The late-nighters are encouraged to get the party started, but everyone else is invited to join in as you wake up the next morning and into the afternoon.\n\nLast night, I asked you which young Cub with a breakout season in 2025 is most likely to sustain (or improve on) that level in 2026. Like me, the plurality of you are big Michael Busch fans as he got 47 percent of the vote. Cade Horton got 28 percent and 25 percent went with Pete Crow-Armstrong.\n\nHere’s the part where we listen to music and talk movies. You are free to skip that part. Don’t know why you would, but to each his or her own. The BCB Winter Science Fiction Classic features one of my all-time favorite films tonight.\n\nTonight we’re featuring the young vocalist Ella Cole who is making a name for herself performing tunes from the Great American Songbook. And of course, Christmas songs pay the bills that allow one to sing other jazz songs the rest of the year. So she released a Christmas album last year.\n\nHere she is singing “That’s What I Want For Christmas,” which is best known as from a Nancy Wilson performance. This is live in studio last year.\n\nYou voted in the BCB Winter Science Fiction Classic between two time-traveling films and you went with the comedy, as Back to the Future advances over 12 Monkeys. You people do love your incest jokes. It’s OK. No judgments.\n\nToday we have one of the biggest blockbuster films of all time against a low-budget indie film. I expect to be disappointed again, but at least I’ll be more understanding this time.\n\n3. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Directed by James Cameron. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day is the 1991 big-budget sequel to the 1984 small-budget surprise hit The Terminator. There are many who think the first film was the better one, but it was this film that became a cultural touchstone, made boatloads of money and brought the phrase “Hasta la vista, baby” to the American lexicon.\n\nIn case you are part of the two percent that are unfamiliar with the premise of the Terminator series, the world was destroyed in 1997 a nuclear holocaust by a malevolent artificial intelligence called Skynet. (We all remember that, right?) What remains of the world is ruled by Skynet and its machine creations, which includes the Terminators. In the year 2029, John Connor leads the human resistance to Skynet’s rule, so in the first film, the T-800 Terminator (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to kill John’s mother Sarah Connor (Hamilton) before he is born. It fails, of course, so in the sequel, Skynet sends a new and improved T-1000 Terminator (Patrick) back in time to kill a ten-year-old John Connor (Edward Furlong). Future John sends back a reprogrammed T-800 (Schwarzenegger again) back in time to save his younger self.\n\nThe paradoxes of such a set-up are not really addressed in the film because Terminator 2: Judgement Day is primarily an action/special effects film. It would, however, be unfair to say that the only point of the plot is to get into big car chases, blow stuff up and make Arnold Schwarzenegger look very cool. It’s unfair because it’s also designed to make Linda Hamilton look cool as hell.\n\nI’m being unjustly snarky there. The heart of the film is really the relationship between the T-800 and the ten-year-old John Connor. John teaches the emotionless robot what it means to be human and why humans have value. In response to the criticisms of the violence in the first film, Cameron has the young John Connor order the T-800 not to kill anyone. Grievously wounding and maiming is just fine, apparently. You wouldn’t want a Terminator who couldn’t fight back at all, especially in a film like this one.\n\nMeanwhile, the T-800 serves as a surrogate father figure and protector figure for John. Along with Sarah, who gets broken out of a mental hospital where she was placed after her repeated rantings about Skynet and Judgment Day, the three of them become a kind of family that draws strength from each other.\n\n(As an aside, the one part of the film that truly bothers me is the way that Cameron fell back on the harmful “evil foster parents” trope early in the film. At least he uses the T-800 to show that you can make a family without biology.)\n\nSchwarzenegger himself is the first to admit that he’s not the greatest actor in the world, but you have to give him credit for this, his greatest role. It helps that his character can’t show emotion, but the film manages to find ways to let T-800 become a character with real “human” traits and a story arc that we can care about. Patrick is terrific as the cold T-1000 villain.\n\nHamilton has to play crazy for much of the film and Cameron pulls off a neat trick by having the creator of Skynet played by Joe Morton. Sarah Connor’s obsession with Skynet leads her to try to murder the man whose creation will doom all of humanity. This is a parallel plot to the way that the T-1000 tries to kill young John. The trick is that Morton is one of the most likable actors around, so if she goes through with killing him, there’s no coming back from the crazy. But she does, and Hamilton does a good job of it. The T-1000 has no such qualms about killing the young John, making a nice contrast between the two attempts to change the future.\n\nAll of this is fine and good, but what elevates Terminator 2: Judgment Day to a classic is the special effects. The T-1000 Terminator (or just the Robert Patrick one if the numbers confuse you) is made out of liquid metal. Shoot it, tear a limb off or whatever, it just oozes back into place. He’s also a shapeshifter that can morph into different people or inanimate objects. T2 wasn’t the first film to use CGI as a special effect, but it was the first one to use it this much and to this great effect. Quite frankly, the effects still look very good by the standards of today. By the standards of 1991, it was positively mind-blowing.\n\nThe special effects were a big, but not the only, reason that the Library of Congress put Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the National Film Registry in 2023. It was also one of the biggest box office hits of all time.\n\nHere’s the trailer for Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n\n6. Repo Man (1984). Directed by Alex Cox. Starring Harry Dean Stanton, Emilio Estevez, Tracey Walter and Olivia Barash.\n\nRepo Man is undoubtedly one of the most creative, out-of-the-box films ever made. Helmed by a first-time director in Cox on a shoestring budget, it throws pretty much everything it can against the wall to see what sticks. It doesn’t all hold together, but what does is pure magic.\n\nRepo Man is a lot of things. It’s a great science fiction comedy film. It’s a good car film. It’s one of the greatest “punk” movies with a fantastic soundtrack featuring the greats of the Los Angeles hardcore scene of the early-eighties as well as an Iggy Pop theme song. It’s one of the more quotable films you’ll ever watch. On top of that, this is a truly great Los Angeles movie, featuring parts of the city that you don’t often see in other films.\n\nDid I mention the whole thing was financed by Michael Nesmith of The Monkees?\n\nThe macguffin of Repo Man is a pair of aliens in the trunk of a ’64 Chevy Malibu. The aliens never leave the trunk, so the special effects are minimal. Also, if you’ve seen Pulp Fiction, the mysterious glow of the briefcase in that film owes a lot to Repo Man. Except in Repo Man, anyone who opens the trunk and looks at the glowing aliens spontaneously combusts and dies, leaving just their shoes.\n\nOtto (Estevez), is an aimless punk who gets roped into helping a car repossession by Bud (Stanton). Initially disgusted by the idea of working as a repo man, he changes his mind after realizing he has no job and no money. Otto comes to love being a repo man after his first real job when he discovers that “the life of a repo man is always intense,” as Bud puts it. Otto, like Bud, likes intense.\n\nAfter a $20,000 bounty comes in for that Chevy Malibu, everyone is out to collect it. Not just Otto and Bud’s Happy Hands Acceptance Company, but the rival Rodriguez brothers, who seem to be a bit more competent at repossessing cars than they are. The CIA also wants the aliens in the Malibu back, as well as a shadowy group called the United Fruitcake Outlet, whom Otto comes in contact with after he picks up the lovely Leila (Barash).\n\nThere is also a group of Otto’s former punk friends who go around “doing crimes” as they put it. They end up stealing the Chevy Malibu by accident.\n\nThe film’s sight gags are legendary. Generic products are everywhere and at one point Otto eats out of a can of food simply labeled “Food.” Pine tree-shaped air fresheners hang everywhere and not just on rear-view mirrors.\n\nThe men and women who work as repo men are also hilarious characters. Bud is best known for his “Repo Man Code” that he recites, but there is also Miller as the crazy mechanic who doesn’t drive and believes every single conspiracy theory he’s ever heard and repeats them in a deadpan manner. The rest of the Happy Hands people have their own wacky personalities as well. The Rodriguez brothers, Leila and her boss Agent Rogersz (Susan Barnes), the punk crime gang of Duke (Dick Rude), Debbi (Jennifer Balgobin) and Archie (Miguel Sandoval) are hilarious characters in their own right\n\nOh, and the Circle Jerks play themselves performing one of their songs as a sad lounge act.\n\nThen there are the quotes. “The life of repo man is always intense” is one, but there are several other lines that you’ll never forget. Many of them I can’t repeat here, but there’s also:\n\nBud: Credit is a sacred trust, it’s what our free society is founded on. Do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia? I said, do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?\n\nDuke: The lights are growing dim Otto. I know a life of crime has led me to this sorry fate, and yet, I blame society. Society made me what I am.\n\nOtto: That’s bull[bleep]. You’re a white suburban punk just like me.\n\nDuke: Yeah, but it still hurts.\n\nDebbi: Duke, let’s do some crimes.\n\nDuke: Yeah. Let’s go get sushi and not pay!\n\nLeila: What about our relationship?\n\nLeila: You [bleep]! I’m glad I tortured you!\n\nAgent Rogersz: It happens sometimes. People explode. Natural causes.\n\nKevin: There’s [bleep] room to move as a fry cook. I could manager in two years. King. God.\n\nAgain, there are several others that I just can’t repeat. The broadcast TV edit of Repo Man is legendary for its creativity as well.\n\nRepo Man is the kind of film that the studios just didn’t get and it basically got buried until the soundtrack started to sell and the record arm at Universal started bugging the film division to start promoting the movie. It got a second release and became an underground hit. It also took off on home video and has remained a cult classic ever since.\n\nHere’s the trailer for Repo Man. There are some more very quotable lines that I didn’t repeat in here.\n\nT2 is on Netflix and Paramount Plus. Repo Man is available for rent.\n\nYou have until Monday to vote. Up next you get another chance to vote for a Terry Gilliam film as Brazil (1985) takes on a classic piece of Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell (1995). Brazil was on TCM last month, I hope you got a chance to watch it. Otherwise, it’s available for rent. Ghost in the Shell is on Amazon Prime (through the end of the month) and the Criterion Channel.\n\nWelcome back to everyone who skips the music and movies.\n\nAs you’ve no doubt heard, former Cubs reliever Brad Keller agreed to a two-year, $22 million deal with the Phillies earlier today. Obviously that’s good news for Keller and bad news for those of us who wanted to see Keller return to the Cubs.\n\nSo tonight’s question is should the Cubs have matched or topped that offer? Keller was a key part of the Cubs bullpen last season, going 4-2 with a 2.07 ERA and three saves. He pitched 69.2 innings and struck out 75 and walked 22. His fastball averaged over 97 miles per hour. His underlying numbers indicate that that wasn’t a total fluke season.\n\nBut of course, relievers and their performance is a volatile thing. As good as Keller was for the Cubs last year, it’s easy to forget that he came to the Cubs on a minor league deal with an invitation to Spring Training. The year before he was released by the White Sox, who lost more games than any other team in modern baseball history.\n\nThat 97 mph fastball was also completely out of line with the rest of Keller’s career, where his velocity was a full four miles per hour slower. Some of that increased velocity is due to pitching out of the bullpen instead of starting, but Keller pitched out of the pen in 2024 and didn’t throw 97 that year. Yes, he made some adjustments coming into last year, but can we really be so sure he’s going to hold that velocity into his thirties?\n\nThe other issue is that from all accounts, the Cubs are still trying to sign starters Tatsuya Imai and Michael King. It’s hard to know how much money they could spend on Keller without knowing how much it will cost to sign one of those two. And neither starter has any incentive to sign anytime soon.\n\nSo you know Brad Keller. Would you take a chance on signing him to a two-year deal? It’s team president Jed Hoyer’s modus operandi to build bullpens out of spare parts and for the most part, he’s been successful doing so. He did give Phil Maton a two-year deal this winter, but for a much lower AAV than Keller got. I’m also reminded how many around here were upset when the Cubs lost out on closer Tanner Scott to the Dodgers last year. Now that was a four-year deal, but I’m sure the Dodgers would just give Scott to the Cubs for free now to get out from under that onerous contract after one terrible year for Scott.\n\nThank you for stopping by. A big thanks goes out to everyone who voted or commented this week. Please get home safely. We can get your coat for you now. Stay warm out there. Recycle any cans and bottles. Tip your waitstaff. And join us again next week for more BCB After Dark.",

    "description": "Rory McIlroy talking about the Golf Channel Games: \"Sometimes when you try something new it doesn't work out. But I think this one really did.\"",
    "fullText": "JUPITER — Shane Lowry could not help himself.\n\nThe Irishman got off to a rough start at the Golf Channel Games — the made-for-TV, silly-season, (unconventional) skills competition held at Trump National Jupiter — sending his first four shots during the driving competition everywhere but in play.\n\nAt one point, the fans attempted to give Lowry the Bethpage Black treatment. Except the boos and trash talk fell a bit short of what Lowry experienced at the Ryder Cup in September.\n\n\"A little bit like New York,\" Lowry said, sarcastically.\n\nMore golf: Here are the big changes TGL golf fans can expect at SoFi Center\n\nTwo four-player teams captained by the top two golfers in the world — No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and No. 2 Rory McIlroy — got together for an event billed as a combination of the NFL Combine, NBA 3-point competition and MLB Home Run Derby.\n\nBut at times this was more like Steph Curry trying to make a 3-pointer with a medicine ball. Or Aaron Judge having to hit the ball on the run.\n\n\"We tried something new,\" said McIlroy, whose team included Lowry, Luke Donald and Haotong Li. \"And sometimes when you try something new it doesn't work out.\n\n\"But I think this one really did. I think the biggest thing is all the players were into it. It was fun. It was a different format, a lot more interaction between the players as opposed to traditional golf. So, yeah, overall it was an awesome night.\"\n\nFor those keeping score at home, Team Scottie, which included Keegan Bradley, Sam Burns and Luke Clanton, defeated Team Rory. With the score tied after the five competitions, the event came down to one chip from just inside 50 yards between the captains.\n\nAnd even then it took two measurements to determine Scheffler's chip was two inches closer to the pin than McIlroy's at 5-feet, 5-inches.\n\nAnd once Scheffler was determined the winner, Lowry picked up his ball and tossed it onto the lake.\n\n\"I thought I got him,\" McIlroy said. \"It looked like from back there that he was a little further away.\"\n\nMcIlroy dominated Scheffler in the Captain's Challenge — the two players hit 10 shots from predetermined spots on the course starting at 200 yards to a 15-foot putt — to force the playoff. And he raised his arms after Scheffler's chip stopped rolling, thinking he was closer.\n\n\"That's what people want,\" McIlroy said. \"They want to see the best players in the world go up against each other, whether it's playing or in a skills challenge or whatever. So for a Wednesday night in December, I think this was pretty good for golf.\"\n\nThe night started with laughs on the range during the driving competition — even McIlroy was doubled over and laughing after Lowrey struggled to keep his ball in play — and continued through the final measurement.\n\nDuring the putting competition, which pitted Lowry against Scheffler, Lowery had a message for his opponent as he approached the first of his nine putts: \"C'mon, Scottie, do your worst.\" It worked, as Lowry won the competition.\n\nIn the team relay, a timed event with one player hitting the tee shot, another in the fairway and two on the green, Lowry hit a poor second shot that landed short of the green. Li was on the green awaiting the ball before realizing he had to hustle to get to Lowry's shot. \"Run my lovely Chinaman,\" Lowry said.\n\nBradley's drive during the team relay was headed straight for teammate Burns, except Burns, standing in the fairway ready to hit the next shot, could not see the ball looking back into the bright lights. \"It's coming at you, Sam,\" Bradley said (players were equipped with earbuds to communicate with each other). Lowry then showed some concern for a member of the other team. \"Literally, it's coming right at you,\" he warned Burns.\n\nScheffler was rushing to hit a 10-foot putt during the team relay when he stopped in his backswing. \"Keegan was yelling at me,\" he said after the miss. \"He made me stop. What are you yelling at me for?\"\n\nThe 14-club challenge pitted two players from each team in a closest-to-the-pin competition from two different spots in the fairway. The catch, they had to use all 14 clubs between them, with the clubs being taken out of the bag as they were hit.\n\nThat resulted in putters and drivers being hit from 150 yards. And a lot of balls in the water. And a lot of trash talk.\n\n\"We have the core audience, which is great, and we know who they are and we know what they like,\" McIlroy said. \"But to try to bring a few more people around or bring a few more people in under the tent, do stuff like this where you make it a little more fun.\n\n\"You look at what YouTube golf's done and you see the amount of people that watch that and enjoy that. This is sort of a hybrid of that. I certainly, I think there's a place for it.\"\n\nTom D'Angelo is a senior sports columnist and reporter for The Palm Beach Post.

    "fullText": "EAST LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) – As the saying goes in the movie ‘ELF,’ the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.\n\nThe Michigan State men’s basketball team was doing exactly that on Wednesday night at One North Kitchen and Bar in East Lansing.\n\nTom Izzo broke out his accordion, and his players sang Christmas carols for those in attendance. Izzo began playing the accordion at the age of 12, stopped when he broke his hand at the age of 13, and started playing again in college.\n\nIzzo told 6 Sports his accordion is around 40 years old, and nights like Wednesday will always mean a lot to him.\n\n“I’m going to talk about it until I’m dead, or until I’m out of here,” Izzo said. “These things are special. I don’t care who you are or what you like; it’s fun to do stuff when people say, ‘Remember when.’ It means a lot to me. Thank God it means something to my players still and thank God it means a lot to my former players.”\n\nWhat made this year’s radio show unique, compared to those in the past, is that senior guard Nick Sanders played the piano while Izzo played the accordion.\n\nSanders has been playing the piano since he was four years old, because his mom ‘forced’ him and his siblings to play. Sanders has been at the holiday radio show all four years of his MSU career and it was on Tuesday when the son of Detroit Lions legend Barry Sanders was told he’d be taking center stage.\n\n“It was nice,” Sanders said about playing at the radio show on Wednesday. ‘Coach had talked to me about it for a few years now. So, it was just a matter of time before I played.”\n\nIzzo said, “He’s incredible. He’s so smart. I told Barry and everybody back home that he was going to be doing it and… (Nick) said he would be more than happy to do it with me.”\n\nThe Spartans will return to action on Saturday in Detroit to take on Oakland at Little Caesars Arena.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Ezra Ausar and Chad Baker-Mazara each scored double figures and led the USC Trojans offensively en route to a breezy 97-70 victory over the UTSA Roadrunners. With this win, the Trojans improve to 11-1 on the young season and are the only team besides Nebraska in the Big Ten with 11 wins.\n\nTo begin this contest, UTSA and USC were pretty much responding back and forth to each other, and at one point, the Roadrunners had themselves a 31-29 lead in the final three minutes of the first half. It wasn't until the Trojans took over the game from that point on and ended the first half on a 13-0 run and retake the lead, 40-31.\n\n\"You gotta play the guys that have the right frame of mind and want to compete and play unselfish, that's why we played so well,\" Head Coach Eric Musselman said on the difference between the first and second half play and why he decided to go into the second half with the same starting five that ended the first half.\n\nDespite the slow start in the first half, Baker-Mazara amped up his intensity and notched 17 second-half points on 4-10 shooting. Baker-Mazara would finish his night with 20 points (5-13 shooting), 5 rebounds, and five assists.\n\nAusar would lead the Trojans' scoring-wise with 22 points in 31 minutes and recorded his first double-double of the season after snagging his 10th board in the second half.\n\nNo other performance was as superb as senior guard Ryan Cornish, who has really churned the pot as of late, but shone in this win, notching 18 points on 6-10 shooting, including going 4-8 from three-point range, and 4 rebounds in 27 minutes. During the last minutes of the game, Cornish was insinuating to his coaches on the bench that he wanted to sub out due to tiredness, but the Trojans' coaches insisted he stay and finish the remainder of the game.\n\n\"I've got to get into a little better of shape,\" Cornish said with a smile on his face when asked to reflect on the final minutes of the game and what was going on through his head when he was trying to grant a sub. \"I asked for a sub because I was tired, and usually it's a good thing to ask for a sub, because it means you're showing your all.\"\n\nThe Trojans are entering their final week of non-conference play, as they managed to secure a game for Sunday after previously announcing that their last home game of December against Brown University was mutually agreed upon between the schools to be cancelled. USC will now face off against UCSC, a Division III school.",

    "description": "The Utah Mammoth beat the Detroit Red Wings 4-1 on Wednesday",
    "fullText": "Over the last two games, the Utah Mammoth have a goal differential of zero.\n\nThey lost 4-1 to the Boston Bruins on Tuesday and beat the Detroit Red Wings on Wednesday. They managed a .667 points percentage during their eastern road trip and they’re now 3-1-0 in their last four games.\n\nBut the Mammoth are still just shy of a playoff spot, as both the San Jose Sharks and the Los Angeles Kings have multiple games in hand, despite the fact that all three teams are tied in terms of points.\n\nHere’s the story of Utah’s win in Detroit.\n\nKarel Vejmelka maintained a shutout for the first 50 minutes of the game, but Emmitt Finnie spoiled it with a power play goal.\n\nThat goal brought the score to 2-1, turning up the pressure for Utah. But with the increased pressure came an increase in motivation, and Dylan Guenther and Kevin Stenlund added a pair of insurance goals to make sure they didn’t let this one slip.\n\nThey’d struggled to generate offense in Boston, but they got everything they needed in Detroit.\n\n“That group has a lot of pride,” head coach André Tourigny said of his team. “There’s a lot of pride, there’s a lot of character. There’s nobody perfect in the world, but those guys care a ton, and they want to be successful together. They showed it tonight in the character situation.”\n\nBoth Keller and Tourigny credited the Mammoth’s win to their willingness to go to the tough areas.\n\n“I think we just had to be better in the dirty areas, around their net, those 50-50 pucks, kind of all over the ice,” Keller said. “That’s something we had an emphasis on today ... having a guy inside at all times. We do that, the rest takes care of itself in the o-zone.”\n\nAll four of Utah’s goals came from the hash marks or lower, with two of them coming off rebounds. When you have guys like 6-foot-6 Simon Edvinsson and 6-foot-3 Ben Chiarot breathing down your neck, holding your ground in front of the net and battling for the puck in the corners is much easier said than done.\n\nTeam-leading 16th goal of the season for Gunner! pic.twitter.com/2gQMDTc1oe\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 18, 2025\n\n“For a lot of our guys, it’s not first nature,” Tourigny said. “So we need to stay on it. I’m not saying that in a negative way I’m saying that we just need to be aware: If we fall asleep, that will go away. So we cannot. We need to stay aware of it and make the commitment of playing that way, and when we do, we have success, so we have to keep going.”\n\nAs mentioned, the Mammoth benefitted greatly from good goaltending on Wednesday — and while their loss on Tuesday should be chalked up as a team loss rather than an individual one, their goaltending didn’t do them any favors that day.\n\nThere’s a magic number at play here: .900.\n\nWith the exception of three games, all of Utah’s wins this season have involved a save percentage of .900 or better. And with the exception of three games, all of their losses have had a sub-.900 save percentage.\n\nIf they hit that number, they can expect to win. If they don’t hit it, they should expect to lose. And their lineup decisions should reflect that.\n\n“A lot of guys played well tonight, everywhere,” Tourigny said. “If you look at our D corps, we were rock-solid. Our goalie was rock-solid. I like our four lines. ... 4-0 at 5-on-5 against the second team in the Eastern Conference, we’ll take that.”\n\nCriticism surfaced on social media Tuesday morning for Keller’s relative lack of production recently. He’s still on pace for 68 points, but he’s capable of much more than that.\n\nHaving unexpectedly lost his father a few weeks ago, it’s hard to blame him — but the team relies on him for offense all the same, and you know he wants to get back to the 1.5 point-per-game pace with which he began the season.\n\nWednesday’s game was a step in the right direction. He broke a three-game point drought, scoring a goal in the first period and adding an assist in the third.\n\n“Kells, he competes,” said head coach André Tourigny. “I think, tonight, he wanted to make the difference, and he scored a big goal, made a great play on Stenny’s goal, but it’s more than that. It’s the fight he had. ... I felt like that about our team, and it started with our captain.”\n\nThat's our Captain! 🔥\n\n🚨1-0, Utah! pic.twitter.com/H7JvinB3UZ\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 18, 2025\n\nThe bulk of NHL fans weren’t familiar with Emmitt Finnie until October of this year. He was a seventh-round pick in the 2023 draft, so expectations of him were never particularly high. But he surprised a lot of people at training camp and he ended up making the team because of it.\n\nThe 20-year-old scored again on Wednesday, giving him eight goals and 16 points in 35 games this season. That’s a great start to an NHL career, and if he keeps progressing the way he is, he’ll carve out a good living for himself.\n\nIt also doesn’t hurt to have Lucas Raymond and Dylan Larkin as your line mates, and averaging more than a minute and a half of power play time helps, too.\n\nJack McBain gets credit for scoring the goal, but it doesn’t happen in the first place without Michael Carcone’s perfect setup.\n\nCarcone picked up a puck off the end boards and fed McBain a no-look, spin-o-rama pass — the type of play you’d expect to see from a superstar, not someone on a league-minimum contract.\n\nBain Train makes it 2-0, Utah! 🚂 pic.twitter.com/5wU0B53bYJ\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 18, 2025",

    "fullText": "Manchester United played out an eight-goal thriller against Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.\n\nThe home side will be rightly frustrated to bag only a point, especially after taking the lead on three separate occasions.\n\nIt was Antoine Semenyo who fired home the first equaliser. A brilliant run and finish showed exactly why so many teams are chasing the Ghanaian’s signature.\n\nThe Red Devils are among those clubs, and as previously relayed by The Peoples Person, INEOS are prepared to pay his £65 million release clause in January.\n\nHowever, it will be far from easy given the likes of Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham Hotspur remain hot on his trail as well.\n\nAs revealed by Fabrizio Romano, United and City contacted the Cherries in the last 48 hours to find out their intentions with their star attacker.\n\n“Tottenham are really interested but a lot will depend on what the player wants to do. This week, both Manchester United and Manchester City called to understand the situation of Semenyo.\n\n“On Monday and Tuesday, the calls took place. £65 million is his release clause. Liverpool had called back in November.\n\n“United are genuinely interested but they had spent a lot of money in the summer to sign their three attackers — Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko.\n\n“So we have to see whether they can afford the sum in January. More than money and finances, the player will ultimately decide where he wants to go.”\n\nWith Amad and Bryan Mbeumo set to be away for AFCON, bringing in the versatile Antoine Semenyo would be a great way to offset those losses.\n\nHe is the third top-scorer in the division this campaign, and can play as a No.10 and wingback, which would suit Amorim’s requirements down to the T.\n\nHowever, what United need most right now is a defensive midfielder. INEOS will take the final call.\n\nFeature image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Old Dominion collects signature win to finish best season ever, while holding the nation’s #2 offense to 10 points.",
    "fullText": "The Old Dominion Monarchs fully joined the FBS in 2014 and rapidly acclimated to the highest level of college football, producing a 10-3 record in 2016. However, through the 2024 season, that was the only winning season Old Dominion ever produced. That changed in 2025, and the program reached a new pinnacle on Wednesday night in Orlando.\n\nSixth-year head coach Ricky Rahne rattled off nine regular season wins to seal Old Dominion’s second winning record as an FBS program, and this breakout 2025 aptly concluded with a statement 24-10 upset over South Florida in the StaffDNA Cure Bowl. In the process, the Monarchs earned their biggest win in program history, adding a second bowl trophy to the shelf while tying their FBS record for wins in a season.\n\nSouth Florida entered this matchup ranked second in the FBS in points (43.0) and yards (502) per game, lighting up opponents with seven games of 48+ points. Only twice did the Bulls score fewer than 31 all season — an 18-16 win over Florida and a 49-12 defeat to playoff-bound Miami (FL). USF faced obvious obstacles with the losses of head coach Alex Golesh (to Auburn), quarterback Byrum Brown, and Keshaun Singleton, and the Bulls could not overcome those absences nor the Old Dominion defense.\n\nSouth Florida registered just 10 points, scoring one first half touchdown and facing a second half shutout to a relentless Monarch bunch. Old Dominion made its presence felt with four sacks and five takeaways, concocting a +4 in the turnover battle against one of the nation’s best turnover-producing teams. Outside linebacker Jeremy Mack totaled a game-high 11 tackles and a sack, while free safety Jerome Carter snagged two interceptions in a 3.5-hour defensive clinic by the boys from Norfolk.\n\nOld Dominion’s offense also faced some pregame adversity, as Sun Belt Offensive Player of the Year Colton Joseph opted out of the remainder of the 2025 season, thrusting Quinn Henicle into the starting quarterback spot. Henicle started and won a game in 2024 with 204 rushing yards, and the sophomore’s mobility was on full display in ODU’s massive win. He only completed 11-of-25 passes but made his presence felt on broken plays, scrambling up the middle for massive gains. Even after four sacks he rattled off 107 rushing yards and two touchdowns, delivering a 51-yard blow with 2:32 remaining to put the game out of reach. Henicle, who returned from a brief third quarter injury stemming from a targeting call, won MVP honors for his effort in Orlando.\n\nSouth Florida’s backup quarterbacks did not enjoy the same level of production as Henicle. Sixth-year senior Gaston Moore earned his first and last collegiate start at quarterback to replace Byrum Brown, and Moore finished 20-of-28 with 236 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. He had one first half sequence where he connected with true freshman Jeremiah Koger for back-to-back 25 and 31-yard pickups — with the latter serving as USF’s lone touchdown. But there wasn’t much explosiveness in the passing game otherwise.\n\nMoore’s last throw was a notable one, and unfortunately for the longtime backup, it was his final collegiate pass. In the fourth quarter, trailing 17-10, he sent a 20-yard strike to JeyQuan Smith at the Old Dominion 14-yard line, and Smith made a spectacular diving grab. However, Moore took a brutal hit while releasing the ball that caused his head to collide with the Camping World Stadium field, ultimately knocking him out of the final 12 minutes.\n\nProtesting the hit, South Florida guard Cole Skinner and interim head coach Kevin Patrick were both assessed with 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalties. Then USF took a sack and holding on the next two plays, ultimately moving the Bulls back from the Old Dominion 14 to their own 38 — a monumental 48-yard difference. USF never even crossed the ODU 40-yard line again, as those penalties proved instrumental in the defeat.\n\nTrue freshman Locklan Hewlett, whose passing experience was limited to a 45-yard fake punt touchdown in Week 1, finished the effort for the Bulls. But on a 4th and 6 from its own 47-yard line with 3:45 remaining, South Florida made the questionable decision to run a fake punt — this time, without Hewlett disguising as a punter. Punter Chase Leon was intercepted by Jerome Carter on a play that never stood a chance, ultimately putting a dagger in USF’s hopes at a 10-win season.\n\nSpecial teams also played a significant role in this contest. Both teams missed two field goals in this game, including several attempts under 40 yards. But special teams ended up favoring Old Dominion overall as the Monarchs denied South Florida of a critical fourth quarter possession. An ODU punt hit a USF gunner two times on Wednesday evening, and on the second occurrence, Monarch long snapper Brendan Durkin made a mid-air recovery after the ball bounced off the gunner and return man.\n\nSouth Florida (9-4, 6-2 American) missed out on a golden opportunity for its first 10-win season since 2017. The Bulls enjoyed their best season in nearly a decade but it comes to a bitter end, as they will be denied a season-ending ranking — a feat the team hasn’t accomplished in eight years. The Bulls now officially move into the Brian Hartline era, as the Ohio State offensive coordinator relocates to Tampa when the Buckeyes’ playoff run is complete.\n\nOld Dominion (10-3, 6-2 Sun Belt) sealed its best season as an FBS member with a victory for the ages. Two of the three Monarch losses — Indiana and James Madison — are competing in the College Football Playoff, and they now unlock a new signature win by upending South Florida. Ricky Rahne celebrated his first bowl win as head coach, capping off an unforgettable moment in the program’s young history.",

He made the move to the college game in 2023, serving as the defensive coordinator at UCLA for one season and at USC for the past two. In both cases, he took over horrendous units and improved them mightily right away. Below is where the Bruins and Trojans defenses ranked in SP+ before Lynn’s arrival and then during his tenure.\n\nBefore D’Anton Lynn: UCLA (2022) — 83rd\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: UCLA (2023 — 17th\n\nBefore D’Anton Lynn:USC (2023) — 105th\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: USC (2024) — 48th\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: USC (2025) — 35th\n\nAt Penn State, he wouldn’t be taking over a dreadful unit — the Nittany Lions, even in a down defensive season, finished 33rd in SP+. But there’s still the element of a lot of transition with NFL departures and potential transfer portal movement that bringing in someone like Lynn who gets improved results right away would be an awesome fit.\n\nSo the guy is good. Really good. And it’d be quite the hire for Matt Campbell to get him just 12 months after the last guy got turned down.\n\nD’Anton Lynn was asked last week why he stayed on as USC’s DC after Penn State, his alma mater, pursued him. \n\nLynn: “I just couldn’t imagine myself coaching anybody else.”\n\n“The people we have here, it was just too tough to leave.”\n\n— Ryan Kartje (@RyanKartje) May 5, 2025\n\nWe’ll see where this goes. It’s a good sign to get a tweet like that from Zenitz, but until there’s a “are finalizing a deal” tweet, this one remains up in the air.",

    "description": "Smith was judged to have been caught behind despite the technology not matching up again",
    "fullText": "Jamie Smith was at the centre of the latest controversy with Snicko technology during a tense day of Test cricket at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nSmith looked to hook a short ball from Pat Cummins and seemingly missed the ball which flew through to Alex Carey behind the stumps.\n\nCarey, Cummins and co. all appealed believing Smith to have made contact with the ball but the England batter was ready to review the umpire’s decision.\n\nBut, the umpire decided to send for a review to see if the ball had cleanly landed in Carey’s hands before making a decision on the field. As part of that process a replay of the incident was shown with Snicko showing a spike after the ball had passed Smith’s bat. At the same time there seemed to be a gap between the bat and ball but the third umpire ruled that Smith had hit the ball and was out.\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes, who was batting at the time, dropped his head in disbelief when the decision was shown on the big screen. Smith’s dismissal left England 159-6 and over 200 runs behind Australia’s first innings total of 371.\n\nThe controversy was just one of several incidents on day two in which the technology process was questioned. Earlier examples saw Smith glove the ball to Usman Khawaja at second slip and Joe Root get an inside edge through to Carey. In both instances the ball bounced before reaching the respective fielders.\n\nOn Test Match Special, Alex Hartley labelled the controversies as ‘ridiculous’ and claimed that the Snicko technology needed ‘sacking’.\n\nShe said: “It is going to boot off here. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. This is where Snicko needs sacking.\n\n“The third umpire said there is nothing obvious there as he could see a gap between the bat and ball. Jamie Smith is convinced he didn't hit it. Australia have gone up and made a loud noise because everybody knows you don't trust Snicko now, so you appeal for everything and review it if you have to.\n\n“Ben Stokes has his hands on his hips. Smith has gone off shaking his head.”\n\nHer view was echoed by former England players Greame Swann and Steven Finn on TNT Sports who both called out the inaccuracies in the technology and for it to be removed.\n\n“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Swann, “Cricket makes itself open to ridicule sometimes.”\n\nThe incident follows yesterday’s controversy over Alex Carey’s DRS review which resulted in him being given not out on 72 despite hitting the ball.",

    "description": "Utes played uncharacteristically sloppy against UC Riverside but used a big third quarter to earn the win.",
    "fullText": "Utah women’s basketball coach Gavin Petersen had a message at halftime for those watching the Utes take on UC Riverside on Wednesday night at the Huntsman Center.\n\n“Apologies to everyone who just watched that. That is not Utah basketball,” he said during a halftime interview on the ESPN+ livestream.\n\nThe Utes had 15 first-half turnovers and were just 4 of 15 from the free-throw line after two quarters against the Highlanders, who entered the night with a 2-7 record but were giving Utah everything that they had in a sloppy game.\n\n“The last five games leading to this one, we were starting to hit our stride, and today, I think I don’t know if it’s Christmas shopping, if it’s just preparing for the break. We have our team Christmas party tomorrow. It’s just a lot of distractions,” Petersen said in an postgame interview on 700 AM.\n\n“... The process is something to embrace, because that process is going to get you a big win come January and February, and that is our stride. Again, glad we won, we can learn the same lessons in a win.”\n\nIt leaves plenty of room for improvement and a re-focus on the fundamentals as Utah gears up for Big 12 play, which starts for the Utes with a road matchup at Arizona next Monday (12 p.m. MST, ESPN+).\n\nUtah’s uncharacteristic play at the Huntsman on Wednesday was bailed out by a dominant stretch during the third quarter, when the Utes went on a 21-4 run over a six-and-a-half minute stretch to turn a one-point game into a 54-36 Utah lead going into the fourth quarter.\n\nUtah shot 13 of 18 in the third quarter and made nine of its first 10 shots in the period, outscoring visiting UC Riverside 31-12 in the third.\n\nThank goodness, because the Highlanders outscored Utah 16-7 in the fourth — in fact, the Utes scored more points in the third quarter alone (31) than they did the other three quarters of the game combined (30).\n\nReese Ross helped lead that effort, as she had her first double-double of the season with 17 points and a career-high 13 rebounds. She also had a team-high six turnovers, though — more on that in a minute.\n\nRoss got the 21-4 run off to a blazing start with back-to-back steals that turned into layups, and six different Utes scored during the run.\n\nUtah outscored UC Riverside 18-4 in points in the paint in the third — flipping that stat in the Utes’ favor on the night — and used its defense to help set up the offense on what was an overall shaky night.\n\n“It’s so important to be able to respond, and I think we did that,” Ross said in an ESPN+ interview, about Utah’s ability to respond and take charge in the third quarter.\n\n“I mean, there’s a lot of things we can learn from this game. ... It’s important, every failure is an opportunity to grow. So just being able to take ownership of what we can get better at and applying it in practice and taking initiative.”\n\nThe Highlanders had one last run in them, using a 10-0 spurt in the fourth quarter to make it a 56-46 game with five minutes to play.\n\nUtah didn’t fold against the visitors, though UC Riverside, to its credit, made life difficult for the Utes all night.\n\nIt’s a good thing UC Riverside shot just 35.1% from the field — and 30.8% in that critical third period — or the Highlanders might have had a real shot to steal a win against Utah, which shot 46% on the night.\n\nThough UC Riverside lost 20 turnovers, the Highlanders forced Utah into 23, the most for the Utes in this six-game win streak.\n\nIt’s a discouraging return to not taking care of the ball. Earlier this season, Utah had 20 or more turnovers in a stretch of four out of five games.\n\nThe Utes lost three of those games, and repeating 20 or more turnovers in Big 12 contests will severely hamper Utah’s chances for victory in one of the nation’s top conferences.\n\n“We knew that they were going to be intentional on defense. I mean, it’s just something we need to be intentional about, not taking reps off and making everything like it’s game like,” Ross said. “And I think, too, it’s good right before conference to get what it’s like to have a pressure defense, because it’s so important. That’s what we’re going to see every single game coming up in conference.\n\n“So we’re just making sure, again, we’re adjusting to pressure defense. Every team sees it. We struggle with pressure. So being able to understand that there’s an opportunity to grow.”\n\nSeven Utah players had two or more turnovers, led by Ross with her six, as well as four each from LA Sneed and Chyra Evans.\n\nPetersen stressed the importance of limiting turnovers, including with Ross, who otherwise paced the Utes’ efforts against UC Riverside.\n\n“With Reese, you know what you get (with) intensity. She’s going to play hard, she’s a rebounder, and she’s going to give it everything she’s got,” Petersen said. “I would love to utilize her more, and that trust has to come with not turning the ball over.”\n\nUtah got some other key contributions from freshmen Avery Hjelmstad and Evelina Otto, a welcome sight on a quiet night for seniors Lani White (8 points) and Maty Wilke (4).\n\nHljelmstad hit two big second-quarter 3-pointers when UC Riverside threatened to increase its then-six point lead, and Hjelmsted was the only other Ute in double-figures, with 10 points. She also had three rebounds and an assist.\n\nOtto came off the bench and helped Utah’s inside presence, scoring 5 points to go with seven rebounds and three assists as the Utes held a 36-20 edge in points in the paint and outrebounded the Highlanders 43-29.\n\nThat was enough to fend off UC Riverside, who was led by a game-high 19 points from Seneca Hackley. She made three of the Highlanders’ seven 3-pointers, while Utah was just 4 of 20 from 3-point range as a team.\n\nBetween the turnovers and free-throw woes especially, there are numbers on the stat sheet the Utes can point to when a lack of focus is discussed from this one.\n\nIt was an abysmal night at the free-throw line for Utah, which finished 9 of 21 at the stripe. Petersen said when he went into halftime and asked who had worked on free throws this week, only one player raised their hand.\n\n“We didn’t have school this week, so like, who got in and shot free throws? One person raised their hand at halftime,” Petersen said. “Well, that’s why you’re gonna shoot from the free-throw line the way you did in first half. Basketball rewards putting in the time and again, that’s something that I want to make sure these young kids understand.”\n\nUtah will have five days to remedy some of those fundamental issues that popped up Wednesday in what was the Utes’ worst effort during their six-game winning streak.\n\n“It’s on us to get back into the practice facility, work on the skills and the fundamentals of basketball so they can thrive when the lights come on,” Petersen said. “And we just didn’t do a good job of that in our one day of prep for UC Riverside. Again, that falls on me, so we’ll definitely fix it.”",

    "fullText": "City have made seven changes for tonight’s Carabao Cup quarter-final clash with Brentford at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nNico O’Reilly, Tijjani Reijnders, Nico and Rayan Cherki are the four starters from Sunday’s 3-0 victory over Crystal Palace in the Premier League that keep their place.\n\nDivine Mukasa returns to the starting line-up after featuring in the previous League Cup wins over Huddersfield and Swansea while fellow Academy players Stephen Mfuni and Charlie Gray are on the bench.\n\nAs well as the injured trio of John Stones, Rodri and Jeremy Doku, we are without Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri who have joined up with Egypt and Algeria, respectively, for the African Cup of Nations.\n\nCITY XI: Trafford, Lewis, Khusanov, Ake (C), O’Reilly, Nico, Reijnders, Bobb, Cherki, Savinho, Mukasa\n\nSubs: Donnarumma, Dias, Haaland, Bernardo, Gvardiol, M Nunes, Foden, Gray, Mfuni\n\nBRENTFORD XI: Valdimarsson, Henry, Van den Berg, Ajer, Collins (C), Kayode, Jensen, Yarmoliuk, Damsgaard, Janelt, Schade.\n\nSubs: Kelleher, Hickey, Pinnock, Lewis-Potter, Peart-Harris, Konak, G Nunes, Arthur, Donovan.\n\nMukasa played as a false-nine in our two previous League Cup wins and could well lead the line for Pep Guardiola’s side tonight.\n\nOscar Bobb and Savinho would then be the wingers although the boss does have the options with the latter able to play centrally.\n\nBut Cherki has also impressed as a wide midfielder so could potentially drop into a more central role alongside Reijnders and Nico.\n\nThere’s plenty for Pep to consider from his starting XI ahead of kick-off.\n\nIt’s another great day for our Academy with five homegrown players starting and three more on the bench.\n\nLeft-footed defender Mfuni was an unused sub in the third round win at Huddersfield while Gray is part of the squad for the first time.\n\nFrom Manchester, Gray is a hard-working holding midfielder who is also capable of playing in a more box-to-box role.\n\nBoth have with the Club since the under-nines and were part of the successful 2024 Youth Cup campaign.\n\nBrentford are also without two players at the African Cup of Nations with Frank Onyeka and Dango Ouattara joining up with the Nigeria and Burkina Faso squads.\n\nWe kept a clean sheet when we won 1-0 at the Gtech Community Stadium in the Premier League as we stood up to the high balls coming into the area.\n\n“They can put the ball in the box from the halfway line, so I think we are prepared for any type of game of course every week or every three days,” Matheus Nunes said after our win at Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\n“We have to prepare differently in certain parts of the game, but mostly when it comes to teams that play low blocks specifically we know that they’re going to put a lot of crosses in.”\n\nThis is just the second campaign we have faced Brentford in the League Cup, winning 5-3 on aggregate in the 1989/90 second round (1-2 away, 4-1 home).\n\nSince doing the Premier League double over City in 2022/23, Brentford have lost four of their last five against City in all competitions.\n\nThis is our first League Cup quarter-final since a 2-0 loss to Southampton in 2022/23. Prior to that, they had progressed from eight consecutive ties at this stage of the competition.\n\nBrentford have reached the League Cup quarter-final for the fourth time in the last six seasons. They beat Newcastle 1-0 in 2020/21, before defeats to Chelsea (2021/22) and the Magpies (2024/25).\n\nCity have won nine of our last 10 home games in the League Cup, scoring 31 goals in the process. The only exception was a 1-0 loss to Manchester United in the 2019/20 semi-final, a tie from which they progressed anyway.\n\nBrentford have won their last two away games in the League Cup, seeing off Grimsby Town 5-0 in round four. Only once have they won three in a row on the road in the competition, doing so between 2017 and 2018.\n\nPhil Foden has been involved in 11 goals in his last 11 starts in the League Cup for City (4 goals, 7 assists). He’s also scored seven goals in eight appearances against Brentford in all competitions.\n\nSeven of Brentford’s eight League Cup goals this season have been scored by different players, with Fabio Carvalho the only player to score more than once. It is already their most ever different scorers in a single League Cup campaign (excluding own goals).",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO – During the week head coach Brian Dutcher likened San Diego State’s games with Air Force to ‘a trip to the dentist.’ After gritting their teeth through the first half, the Aztecs earned their lollipop with a 81-58 win over the Falcons on Wednesday night at Viejas Arena.\n\nBJ Davis scored 13 of his 19 points over a 4:10 stretch in the second half to go with a game-high 6 assists, while Miles Heide had 12 points and eight rebounds to go with Taj DeGourville having his best scoring game since the season opener with 9 points on three 3’s.\n\nDefense keyed the second half swing after San Diego State (6-3, 1-0) led by 3 points at the half of their final Mountain West Conference opener. They dished a season-high 27 assists, making just four baskets without a helper, and forced 10 of Air Force’s (3-9, 0-1) 15 turnovers in the second half, getting 14 of their 19 points off turnovers in the final 20 minutes.\n\nThe second half began with a scrambling no-look save by Miles Byrd to Magoon Gwath in the post, who fed it up top for Heide to knock down his first 3-pointer of the season and the third from downtown of his career.\n\nSDSU and the Falcons traded scores until Heide picked up his third personal foul at the 15:13 mark, which brought Pharaoh Compton into the game and raised the temperature for the Aztec defense. After the Falcons turned it over just four times in the opening half, they turned it over five times in the first eight minutes of the second.\n\nHarrington got free for a straight-line drive for a layup and then Compton got fouled on a dunk for an and-1 that gave the Scarlet and Black their first double-digit lead at the 14:13 mark.\n\nDavis then had his ‘hibachi’ moment, knocking down a 3-pointer to start a stretch where he scored 13 of SDSU’s next 15 points. Over that span the Aztec lead grew to 61-44 and then even further when Gwath split a pair of free throws and DeGourville tripled.\n\nSDSU allowed the Falcons to score multiple buckets in a row just once in the second half, a 6-0 stretch just after the nine minute mark, but by then the game was well out of reach.\n\nA final run of 9-0 put a bow on things, with Davis knocking down the final of his four triples and Compton punctuating it with a dunk, as the forward had 11 points in 17 minutes off the bench.\n\nBrandon Pollard - The Sporting Tribune\n\nSan Diego State forward Miles Heide (40) fights for the ball during an NCAA Basketball game between Air Force and San Diego State, Wednesday December 17, 2025 at Viejas Arena in San Diego, Calif.\n\nIt had seemed too easy over the first few possessions for the Aztecs, beginning the game with an and-1 by Gwath and a cutting Heide layup in the first 42 seconds of the game.\n\nBut the Falcons 3-2 zone caused problems when SDSU was forced to work their half-court set, going scoreless over a 5:32 stretch where they missed eight in a row from the field. During that time the Falcons opportunistically converted on a pair of open 3-pointers in an 8-0 spurt that led to an early 3 point lead.\n\nIt grew as large as 4 points when Eli Robinson tripled again from the right wing at 12:49, but a steal and score by Davis led to a transition dunk that woke up the Scarlet and Black offense.\n\nJeremiah Oden splashed a long ball, then Reese Dixon-Waters found Heide left alone in the middle of the zone for an uncontested dunk, which kick-started SDSU’s sixth 10-plus point run of the season. Playing with a quicker tempo helped the Aztecs reel off six makes in a row, pushing the lead out to 23-15 with 8:28 remaining, then after a Falcons make, DeGourville nailed a straight-away 3-pointer to give SDSU their largest lead of the half.\n\nBut the Scarlet and Black struggled shooting down the stretch, making just three shots—all on layups or in the paint— while missing 11 of their final 14 shots from the field. It enabled the Falcons to creep back within 33-30 at the half.\n\nNine of the Aztecs that played in the opening 20 made a field goal, with Gwath and Heide’s 7 points apiece the most on the squad.\n\nAfter notching a win against a team ranked well into the 300’s in most major overall metrics, the Aztecs will face the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats next. Tip off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 20 at PHX Arena in Phoenix, Ariz.",

    "fullText": "Moises Caicedo will miss part of Chelsea’s Carabao Cup semi-final as The Blues get a tough London draw for the next round.\n\nThe midfielder was booked in the last game for a sarcastic clapping action towards the Referee, which was very silly. And now, per The Daily Mail, he misses the first leg of the next round which happens to be the semi-finals.\n\nIt looking at the draw for the semi-finals, which happened late on Wednesday evening, it looks like Caicedo is going to be a big miss for The Blues.\n\nThat is because they are either up against Arsenal, or Crystal Palace, depending on the winner of that game of course. It will be a very tough London tie no matter whether Chelsea end up facing the current Premier League leaders and favourites, or Crystal Palace, who are having a very good season under the management of Oliver Glasner so far.\n\nPedro Neto celebrates against Cardiff. (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nDespite beating Cardiff City 3-1 in the quarter finals of the competition earlier in the week, Chelsea can count themselves quite lucky to be in the semi-finals due to the fact that Cardiff were very much unlucky to lose against them. It was 1-1 in the game until two late goals from two Chelsea subs that Enzo Maresca had to bring on because the current crop of players on the pitch were just not performing.\n\nChelsea can beat any team on their day so it’s a fact now that they have a decent chance of reaching the final now and even winning the competition altogether.\n\nMaresca and his young side would love to add more silverware to their achievements.",

    "fullText": "A player of his quality, who gives so many options for Liverpool and only costs £65m would be an absolute bargain.\n\nLet's wait and see what happens because it feels like the entire Premier League also wants to sign him.\n\nBut what people forget about Semenyo is his story. He is the ultimate underdog. When he was a teenager he was rejected by massive clubs, including Arsenal.\n\nHe hadn't really played academy football until he arrived at Bristol City as an 18-year-old. Then he went on loan to the National League and League Two, playing for Bath City and Newport County.\n\nThose loans meant he was able to play for Bristol City's first-team, where he slowly established himself as one of the best young attackers in the Championship, catching Bournemouth's attention in the process.\n\nNow it seems like Bristol City are ready to write another success story. But this time around, their next Semenyo could be from Liverpool.\n\nAccording to Ian Gay a Managing Consultant and Mentor, who is well connected to Bristol City on X, the club has agreed a deal for Ranel Young to join the Championship side.\n\nFootball Insider have also confirmed Bristol City's agreement with Young.\n\nGay mentions how Young is seen as a similar profile to Semenyo.\n\nHe's 19-years-old and spent the majority of his academy career at Liverpool, he even sat on the bench for the first-team two times under Arne Slot but never made an appearance before being released by the club.\n\nYoung has since spent the last few months in Serbia, moving to a second division side in what was a bizarre move.\n\nNow he's back in England and at Bristol he looks like he will be given the pathway to restore his career and make a name for himself.\n\nWhether he can actually follow in the footsteps of Semenyo remains to be seen.",

    "fullText": "In a much-anticipated showdown between 5A contenders on Wednesday night — a rematch in fact of last year’s semifinal — it took Bountiful a bit to get going, but once it did it never looked back.\n\nBountiful coach Joel Burton thought his players looked a bit fatigued in the opening minutes perhaps due to a game against Skyline the night before, but they settled in quick building a nine-point lead by the end of the quarter and never looked back on their way to the 56-46 win at Wasatch.\n\n“I felt like our legs were tired as we started the game, and just took us a little while to kind of get into the flow of what we like to do. And just to see us kind of loosen up … and then the shots started dropping. And so it was just nice seeing our kids get flowing again last—there tonight,” said Burton.\n\nBountiful used balanced scoring to secure the win, with Ute signee Milika Satuala leading the way with 15 points, followed by Maleah Nelson with a dozen, Maile Murdock with 11 and Brynna Castleton with 10.\n\n“I’ll take that every game if I can get it. We’ve got some young kids that are definitely growing up and starting to take a little bit of the pressure off of that starting five, thank goodness. So it’s nice to see Miley and Peyton (Orchard) really starting to fill that role, and among many others that are starting to just get confident playing at the varsity level,” said Burton.\n\n“We knew that was going to be the issue coming into the year was finding that group behind the first —behind our starting five, and we’re starting to figure that out.\"\n\nMuch of Bountiful’s damage was done in the first half, as it opened up a 16-7 lead after the first quarter and then stretched it to 21-7 at the 5:54 mark of the second quarter on a corner 3-pointer from the freshman Murdock, her third of the game.\n\nWasatch finally halted the Redhawks’ fast start to cut the lead to 10 by halftime.\n\nWasatch’s press caused some turnover issues late in the game for Bountiful, which saw its lead whittle to seven points in the final minute, but the Wasps ran out of time to cut into the lead another further as it fell to 10-2 on the season.\n\nThe win pushes three-time defending state champion Bountiful’s record to 8-1 on the season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe College Football Playoff will feature plenty of great future NFL talent with the 12 teams making the field. While it might not be surprising Ohio State's loaded team dominates the pro prospects, 18 of Sporting News' 32 first-round projections in all are tied to CFP action.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead with five such picks, with Georgia, Oregon, Texas A&M, Alabama and Miami also in line to have multiple selections on Day 1. Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas Tech get on the board, too. That's incredible representation from three-fourths of the CFP teams, which also account for all three QBs and four of the first five overall picks.\n\nHere is the Sporting News' latest NFL Mock Draft ahead of the 2025 College Football playoff.\n\nMORE: Bills, 49ers rise as Packers fade in latest SN Power Rankings\n\n(No. 1-18 order courtesy of Tankathon; No. 19-32 from Week 16 playoff picture)\n\nArvell Reese, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Giants, if they stay at No. 1 overall and don't trade out of this pick for a team wanting a quarterback, should consider taking Reese as an all-around force to fix a lot of their defensive issues away from a rather productive pass rush.\n\nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana (6-5, 225 pounds)\n\nThe Raiders can't be happy with their quarterback situation post-Derek Carr, with Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett screaming that they need to go after a true, strong, accurate franchise passer solution. Mendoza looks the part with his arm and intangibles, two things that should appeal to the influence of Tom Brady.\n\nMORE: How Fernando Mendoza won the 2025 Heisman over Diego Pavia, Jeremiyah Love, Julian Sayin\n\nRueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami (6-3, 275 pounds)\n\nThe Titans also don't need a QB after taking Cam Ward No. 1 overall last year, but they can go back to the Hurricanes program to get the game-changing pass-rusher they desperately need for their latest defensive reboot.\n\nJordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona State (6-2, 200 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to stop messing around at wide receiver and give either Shedeur Sanders or a different starting quarterback a true go-to all over the field, both in the slot and outside, in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jaxon Smith-Njigba vein, only lacking the hyphen.\n\nDante Moore, QB, Oregon (6-3, 206 pounds)\n\nMoore has the leadership and intangibles to handle being the next shot at a franchise QB in New York as well as the savvy and strong arm. They also need to get a real long-term option after the Justin Fields flop.\n\nTroy Wayrynen/USA TODAY Network\n\nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame (6-0, 214 pounds)\n\nThe Cardinals saw the breakdown early of pending free agent James Conner and have had an unhealthy mess of a committee trying to replace him. This may seem like a luxury pick for a team that has a lot of needs, but they can get some tackle help later and Love can be a game-changer for restoring balance and expanding the explosiveness.\n\nMakai Lemon, WR, USC (5-11, 195 pounds)\n\nThe Saints, should they stick with Tyler Shough at QB, need to give him more weapons after depleting the receiving crops beyond Chris Olave. Kellen Moore can have some visions of Lemon being the DeVonta Smith to Olave's A.J. Brown should Shough show big improvement.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' expert predictions for 2025 College Football Playoff\n\nCaleb Downs, S, Ohio State (6-0, 205 pounds)\n\nThe Commanders need to get younger and more impactful in their defense after things fell apart in their secondary and around Bobby Wagner at linebacker. Downs is a terrific do-everything hybrid who would be set up to make a lot of big plays in Dan Quinn's scheme.\n\nPeter Woods, DT, Clemson (6-3, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Bengals need to keep beefing up their defensive line to pull out of being atrocious against the run and it doesn't hurt to have some of Woods' inside pass-rush juice to support their end rotation.\n\nJermod McCoy, CB, Tennessee (6-0, 193 pounds)\n\nThe Rams know that cornerback coverage is their biggest weakness on an otherwise loaded roster, with some retooling needed. They keep up the strong defensive pick momentum with the nice-sized, tough McCoy.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (6-6, 315 pounds)\n\nThe Dolphins need to get more offensive line help for wherever they go at QB and they can stay in town to get a long-term all-around rock in Mauigoa.\n\nKenyon Sadiq, TE, Oregon (6-3, 245 pounds)\n\nThe Chiefs need to be feeling the imminence of Travis Kelce's retirement and can step right into drafting his dynamic go-to receiver replacement to boost Patrick Mahomes again once he returns from his torn ACL.\n\nMORE: Why it's not time to announce the Chiefs dynasty over yet\n\nMansoor Delane, CB, LSU (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Vikings will need to keep working on their secondary with some contract issues ahead and Delane is not that far off in battling McCoy for the status as the best corner in this class.\n\nDavid Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech (6-3, 250 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys will go to work on replacing Micah Parsons' pass rush production with this Lubbock chess piece who has all the moves to get to the quarterback as well as unique dropback coverage ability for the position.\n\nMORE: Full list of stadiums hosting 2025 College Football Playoff games\n\nKeldric Faulk, EDGE, Auburn (6-6, 285 pounds)\n\nThe Ravens should love this complete outside linebacker option who can provide power vs. the run as well as needed pass-rush juice.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State (6-4, 243 pounds)\n\nThe Panthers have been feeling the void at linebacker for a while after it was once a strength and GM Dan Morgan should have intrigue to go for his former position with Styles, a versatile talent who makes a lot of plays everywhere along with Reese.\n\nCashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M (6-2, 248 pounds)\n\nHowell can give the Lions the needed strong complementary pass rusher for Aidan Hutchinson to relieve their secondary coverage a lot more next season.\n\nAvieon Terrell, CB, Clemson (5-11, 180 pounds)\n\nThe Jets, after going QB with Moore earlier in this mock, can get their Sauce Gardner replacement with the pick acquired in that trade with Terrell, brother of Falcons star A.J.\n\nMORE: Latest news on QBs entering NCAA transfer portal\n\nSpencer Fano, OT, Utah (6-6, 302 pounds)\n\nThe Texans have gotten surprising returns from rookie Aireontay Ersery and the rest of their rebuilt line but should be in the market to boost pass protection and run blocking at either right tackle or guard with Fano.\n\nT.J. Parker, EDGE, Clemson (6-3, 265 pounds)\n\nThe Cowboys shouldn't mind doubling up on pass-rush help here with Parker and Bailey, as Parker can provide more traditional burst and finishing moves from defensive end to help Quinnen Williams in Matt Eberflus' front four.\n\nCarnell Tate, WR, Ohio State (6-3, 195 pounds)\n\nThe 49ers seem ready to cut ties with injured Brandon Aiyuk, which means they will need to find a dynamic speedy big target for Brock Purdy to better take advantage of his ace deep passing. Tate would be a natural fit with George Kittle and Jauan Jennings downfield.\n\nMORE: Ranking the 25 Heisman Trophy winners since 2000\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State (6-3, 326 pounds)\n\nThe Bills have been terrible against the run and McDonald is a natural and physically overwhelming run-stopper for the Buckeyes, shooting up boards with his dominant play fron the regular season.\n\nCaleb Banks, DT, Florida (6-6, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Chargers also could bolster their interior to help their front seven in multiple ways and Banks has the right kind of power and pop for Jesse Minter.\n\nBrandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina (6-0, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Seahawks didn't trade pending free agent Riq Woolen and will need to find their strong replacement outside to support Devon Witherpoon. Cissee can be seamless in the schme of Mike Macdonald.\n\nMORE: Picks against the spread for all 35 bowl games\n\nR Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma (6-2, 249 pounds)\n\nThe Buccaneers should covet this explosive pass-rusher built to thrive in Todd Bowles' scheme and help restore their old strength on the second level.\n\nTy Simpson, QB, Alabama (6-2, 208 pounds)s\n\nThe Steelers should be in the market for a starting QB early if Aaron Rodgers retires and Simpson's brand of pocket passing would provide plenty of promise.\n\nOlaivavega Ioane, G, Penn State (6-4, 330 pounds)\n\nThe Eagles have had issues at right guard this season and Ioane would be the easy upgrade coming from State College to Philly. sliding over from his left side position in college to start right away and upgrade over Tyler Steen.\n\nCaleb Lomu, OT, Utah (6-6, 304 pounds)\n\nThe Browns need to rebuild their offensive line right up there with getting more reliable receivers and Lomu would be a good initial building block, going not long after teammate Fano.\n\nChristen Miller, DT, Georgia (6-3, 305 pounds)\n\nThe Bears need to work on their interior for Dennis Allen's front and Miller would be ideal to help them with their own run-stopping problems.\n\nKC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&M (5-11, 190 pounds)\n\nThe Patriots should love what this dynamic slot can do as the ideal fit in Josh McDaniels' offense to make big plays in the open field after the catch and upgrade over Pop Douglas and other complements to Stefon Diggs.\n\nMORE: Updated list of every college coaching change for 2026\n\nKadyn Proctor, OT, Alabama (6-7, 366 pounds)\n\nThe Rams can again think more about the near future with this second first-rounder with Proctor looking solid as their future long-term tackle on either the right or left side.\n\nC.J. Allen, LB, Georgia (6-1, 235 pounds)\n\nThe Broncos need to cover more ground defensively on the second level and Allen would provide that typical Bulldogs athlete who can get around well vs. run and in coverage.",

    "title": "China Speed",
    "description": "Erik on product management and such",
    "fullText": "DILEMMA WORKS\nErik on product management and such\n\nOn China Speed\n\nHow Chinese firms work and how they perform in the market is a matter of perspective that gives entirely opposite outcomes. If you are outside of China and see the brands emerging on the global market - BYD, DJI, Insta360, OnePlus before the merger with OPPO, etc. - you may be of the view that their companies are unstoppable because they manage to combine high-performing products, a good user- and ownership experience, quality, competitive pricing, with high speed of execution. They simply design an launch new products faster than anyone else can. You may therefore have formed that “China Speed’ is the key to competing with China’s global brands.\n\nIf you are inside China, however, you will instead view these firms as unicorns, and your view will instead be filled with the hundreds or thousands of firms that fail to move past push-selling and price competition, brands that are unknown or have negative connotations because of shoddy product quality and after-sales service. You are more likely to see chuhai, or growing into the global market, as something almost unachievable.\n\nSpeed is a significant strategic advantage provided that you are moving in the right direction, meaning you have a strategy, and you do so without sacrificing quality.\n\nChina Speed is now one of the concepts that are going to be taken at face level and bragged about by the same people who have recently started talking about how they work 996 (they don’t).\n\nLike with 996, China Speed is fundamentally misunderstood and therefore can never be applied outside of China. There are in fact two types of China Speed. The productive type does not come from doing things quickly at all. It comes from structural advantages that have been built over decades, like having your office next to the factory, which itself is next to all of its relevant suppliers.\n\nIn the example of BYD, their advantage is not only that they own their factories and that 70% of their components are made by suppliers owned by the BYD group, or that they can get better margins by controlling prices. What really creates and advantage is that they can design and prototype a new model, together with the parts that go into it that will be manufactured by its suppliers, instead of having to go through long contract negotiations to get the parts that enable a new model to be launched.\n\nBYD employees undoubtedly work longer hours and perhaps at a higher pace than automotive employees in Europe, but it is not what makes up BYD’s formula for success, because the structural advantage is in place after decades of methodical construction. Unlike employees at TikTok Shop, which I below reference as an example of destructive speed, BYD employees are not pushing on a string.\n\nThe destructive type is focusing on doing everything, doing anything no matter what it is, just as long as you do it quickly. In organizations that favor this type of speed, China Speed is a form of procrastination at the leadership level, so that they will not have to do the hard work of forming a vision and making decisions that can prove to either be good or bad. They fear the latter outcome, so they tell their teams to do things quickly, just A/B test something, actually a lot of things, and show me the results of the things that happen to work out, so I can put it in my report and show leadership.\n\nThis is speed, no chaos, as a value above everything. It sacrifices quality, it sacrifices relationships with business partners as well as customers and it destroys the brand. In another essay I’m currently working on, I will outline how Chinese firms grow in the global markets, what stages they go through and what organizational capabilities they must build up. The firms that try to just be faster will never get past the second stage, which is price leadership, and many don’t even get past stage one.\n\nThese leaders say they really care about data, but they don’t because they don’t make any decisions. They want experiment results, and they want to show them as achievements to their managers. But they never use data to inform strategy.\n\nFor Chinese firms going global, focusing on speed above all else means that failure is a given. Lets look at ByteDance and their TikTok Shop as an example. You would probably say that ByteDance, through TikTok, is an example of a Chinese organization that is adept at launching global products. But ByteDance did not build TikTok, they acquired musical.ly and its 240 million userbase and re-branded it. It is only through this foundation they have been successful.\n\nWhen ByteDance try to build global products from 0, they have a much lower rate of success, and TikTok Shop is a monumental failure in every region it has been launched - in UK and Europe, in the US and in Southeast Asia.\n\nThis is the story from Indonesia:\n\nLast year, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDancei, acquired a majority stake in its Indonesian online retail rival, Tokopedia, to abide by local laws that restrict social media companies from running e-commerce businesses. Following the acquisition, TikTok tucked its app interface into Tokopedia, and rebranded the platform as TikTok Shop by Tokopedia.\n\nThe merger has disrupted Indonesia’s $65 billion e-commerce market, Simon Torring, co-founder of market research firm Cube Asia told Rest of World. Since the acquisition, TikTok has laid off at least 2,500 employees across the merged entity, while sellers say they have lost agency over the platform.\n\n“Tokopedia’s sales volume has continued to decline steadily after ByteDance’s acquisition,” Torring told Rest of World. “For the first couple of quarters, we gave them the benefit of the doubt of being a new owner carrying out messy integration work. At this point, it’s clear that they are not investing strategically in Tokopedia.”\n\n“I’m not planning to make videos or to do livestream [to promote my products],” Helmin, a seller from Jakarta, told Rest of World. Helmin, who asked to be identified by her first name only, said she directed buyers to her Shopee store instead, where she continues to sell snacks and beverages imported from Korea, Vietnam, and Turkey.\n\nSo messy has TikTok’s merger been that it’s driven thousands of sellers to Toco, a little-known platform promising zero fees for life. Shopee and TikTok take a 2.5% cut from each sale.\n\n“In Southeast Asia, Chinese companies usually invest [in other companies], instead of managing [them] directly, like how Shopee is backed by Tencent and Lazada by Alibaba,” Ming Yii Lai, research manager at Shanghai-based Daxue Consulting, told Rest of World. “[Now], they localize their operations, with independent CEOs making very fast decisions.”\n\nThat strategy isn’t paying off in Indonesia, where many sellers say Tokopedia has “lost its soul” and been “reduced to just another generic Chinese marketplace,” a Jakarta-based seller wrote in a LinkedIn post. “There’s nothing wrong with that on paper, but the truth is, Indonesians shop differently. We look for connection, for trust, for the sense that we’re part of something local and meaningful.”\n\n— restofworld.org, July 2025\n\nIn the UK, TikTok Shop has had massive organizational and leadership problems and had to rebuild the organization several times since 2021:\n\nA culture clash between TikTok’s Chinese owners and some of its London employees has triggered a staff exodus and complaints about an aggressive corporate ethos that runs counter to typical working practices in the UK.\n\nThe friction has centred on the social media company’s ecommerce initiative, TikTok Shop, which launched in the UK in October. Joshua Ma, a senior executive at China’s ByteDance — owner of the viral video app — and the head of ecommerce at TikTok Europe, outraged London-based staff at a dinner this year when he said that, as a “capitalist”, he “didn’t believe” companies should offer maternity leave.\n\nThe episode is emblematic of a broader clash within the ecommerce division. At least 20 members of the London ecommerce team — around half of all its original staff — have left since TikTok Shop’s launch, while others say they are on the brink of quitting. Two employees have been paid settlements over working conditions.\n\n“There are people leaving every week, it is like a game — every Monday we ask who has been fired, who has quit,” one current employee said.\n\n— FT, June 2022\n\nThis is essentially four lost years and billions in investment burned because ByteDance wanted to move fast. In 2025, TikTok Shop has been re-launched in beta in the UK:\n\nAlthough the launch of TikTok Shop bodes well for business on paper, in practice its launch could be significantly more complicated.\n\nThis isn’t TikTok’s first ride in the rodeo of social commerce, after all. Culture clashes between TikTok’s Chinese owners and London staff tainted TikTok Shop’s UK launch in 2021.\n\nReports of burnout and tension between staff and former TikTok head of ecommerce Europe, Joshua Ma, led to an exodus of more than 20 members from the London team.\n\nThis rocky start was followed by a lack of traction, with the Shop operating at a loss and many live streams generating zero sales.\n\n— startups.co.uk, June 2025\n\nAn overall review of TikTok Shop’s on-going struggles in various markets can be found at Toutiao:\n\nA TikTok employee told Caijing Tianxia Weekly that Chinese nationals working overseas are mostly in technical roles, which typically involve a relatively stable and flexible pace. Given their familiarity with ByteDance’s work model, they generally adapt well to TikTok’s environment. However, TikTok Shop—a fledgling e-commerce division under significant revenue pressure—demands much higher work intensity. Since this department relies heavily on local operational talent, clashes inevitably arose.\n\nThis incident is merely one facet of the broader cultural conflicts TikTok faces overseas. Many perceive TikTok’s e-commerce expansion as aggressively “wild-growing,” yet it continually struggles with localization—a challenge common to all Chinese tech companies going global.\n\n…\n\nAs ByteDance’s primary vehicle for global expansion, TikTok has made significant inroads in numerous markets. However, managing dispersed teams across the US, UK, Japan, Brazil, Germany, Singapore, and elsewhere inevitably presents complex challenges.\n\nAJ (a pseudonym), a research and development engineer at TikTok’s US office, told Caijing Tianxia Weekly that in his R&D team, 70% of employees are of Chinese descent. Since TikTok evolved from Musical.ly—a Shanghai-based company—much of the inherited code documentation remains in Chinese, creating language barriers for foreign staff.\n\n…\n\nAJ believes this is nearly impossible at TikTok. In his R&D team, managers (mostly of Chinese descent) oversee 30–40 people each—a ratio “unimaginable in the US,” where frontline managers typically supervise only 5–6 individuals (only senior managers handle 30–40).\n\nFurther problems caused by the single-minded focus on speed at TikTok Shop US can be read about in Special Submission | My Two and a Half Years at ByteDance E-Commerce in the U.S.: From Hope to Disillusionment which was written by a Chinese engineer.\n\nLet’s list all the numerous problems it has created:\n\nStrategy — ByteDance assumes that live commerce, which shows promising signs in China but is by far not proven as a new model of e-commerce instead of a niche, will work in other locales. They have not done the work to prove the model, but simply chose the path of replicating exactly what they did in China, and doing so quickly.\nIn reality, live commerce has existed since at least the 1990s, most notably with QVC, and has only ever been a minor share of retail. It suits only a minor segment of customers, and only fits promotion-driven companies and most often low-cost products.Organization - Most employees, even Chinese transplants, leave after a year or two, and foreign employees rarely last a year. They have had to rebuild the organization multiple times in each locale.Partner relationships - Sellers that have worked with TikTok Shop swear to never do so again, due to how hard they were pushed, how poorly they were treated, and how much money they lost.Revenue - Every year, in each locale, TikTok Shop significantly underperforms its set goals. You may say that maybe they just set aggressive goals — but if you set goals that everyone knows cannot be met, then there are no goals, and without goals there can be no strategy. And that is exactly right: TikTok Shop is a flailing operation without strategy, for which a singular focus on doing things quickly has been replaced.\n\nThis is why Chinese teams have 30-40 team members, why leaders are too overwhelmed to think strategically, why people leave quickly, why people have to work 996 but accomplish less than 965, why being “data-driven” is nonsense when you are only looking at A/B tests of random, guess-work features and traffic that may go up due to promotion-driven campaigns, while the house is on fire.\n\nWhat did DJI and Insta360 do differently to become the first Chinese, global category leaders in drones, gimbals and cameras?\n\nThey built separate organizations for China and International markets, they hired people with experience and knowledge of the markets inside China HQ and outside of China in the regional offices, and based on these capabilities they created strategies for their respective markets. They never brought leaders from the China market to copy paste tactics that worked in China, and they never sent people who couldn’t speak English to lead their international offices. As a result, they have the strongest brands and the best products on the market.\n\nSo, as a summary, the productive type of speed is not a strategy and it is not an organizational value. Speed is an outcome from building an organization and an environment to operate in that makes resources accessible. Whenever speed itself is used as a strategy, it is the destructive type of speed that is being used. And whenever speed is used instead of strategy and proper organizational design, it is because leadership has abdicated its responsibility to do exactly these things.",

    "description": "A new study has measured the levels of indoor air pollution emitted by everyday home appliances, revealing which ones you might want to think twice about running.",
    "fullText": "A new study has measured the levels of indoor air pollution emitted by everyday home appliances, revealing which ones you might want to think twice about running.\n\nLed by a team from Pusan National University (PNU) in South Korea, the researchers set up a special lab chamber, then measured the emissions of airborne ultrafine particles (UFPs) emitted by various household devices.\n\nThese UFPs measure less than 100 nanometers in size – small enough to sink deep into the body.\n\nThe team tested different types of toasters, air fryers, and hair dryers, and most of these appliances emitted a high number of UFPs. The worst offender was a pop-up toaster, which without any bread inside it, gave off around 1.73 trillion UFPs per minute.\n\nWhile the potential effects on human health weren't directly measured in this study, simulations run by the team showed that the UFPs would be too fine for the nose to filter them out, allowing them to penetrate deep into the lungs of adults and children. With their smaller airways, children could be most at risk from these particles sticking around.\n\n\"Our study emphasizes the need for emission-aware electric appliance design and age-specific indoor air quality guidelines,\" says Changhyuk Kim, an environmental engineer from PNU.\n\n\"In the long term, reducing UFP emissions from everyday devices will contribute to healthier indoor environments and lower chronic exposure risks, particularly for young children.\"\n\nElectric heating coils and brushed DC motors in the devices seemed to play a large role in UFP emission. The brushless hair dryers tested emitted some 10 to 100 times fewer particles than the hair dryers with motors inside.\n\nWhat's more, as well as the UFPs, the researchers found evidence of heavy metals – copper, iron, aluminum, silver, and titanium – in the airborne particles too. It seems these metals are most likely coming off the coils and motors directly.\n\n\"These associated heavy metals increase the risk of cytotoxicity and inflammation when the particles enter the human body,\" says Kim.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that this study didn't test the potential health impacts of these appliances and the UFPs they produce – but plenty of prior research has done that, and the findings aren't promising.\n\nThese particles have been linked to conditions including asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer.\n\nAn increasing amount of research is now looking at problems with indoor air quality, whether that comes from appliances, deodorants, or hairsprays. With a warming climate and a global pandemic, many of us are now tending to spend more of our time indoors than we ever have.\n\nThe researchers want to see more done to improve the safety of home appliances, and the level of UFP emissions they give off – a problem starkly highlighted in this study. Design and efficiency improvements can be put in place by manufacturers, but it's likely that tighter regulations will be required to enact change.\n\n\"Understanding the source of the pollutants helps to develop preventive measures and policies for keeping healthy indoor air quality,\" says Kim.\n\nThe research has been published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Special thanks to Zachary Williamson, Afra Wang, Mark Lutter,\nBalaji Srinivasan and Primavera di Filippi for feedback and\nreview\n\nOne of the recurring ideological themes of the last few decades has\nbeen the idea of creating entire new communities, cultures, cities and\neven countries. Instead of having a fixed number of these, all slowly\nchanging, we can \"let a thousand\nnations bloom\" (where \"nation\" can cover the full spectrum from a\nglorified internet forum to a literal country), giving people more\nchoice and opening up space for more pluralistic independent innovation.\nInstead of your membership in one being an accident of birth, each\nperson can choose to gravitate to the communities that best fit their\nvalues.\n\nThese ideas are diverse. Some of them are explicitly about getting as\nmuch legal autonomy as possible, and using that platform to create new\nlaws from the ground up. Others value a more gradualist approach, and a\nmore long-term closer connection to existing groups and institutions\nrather than re-building everything from zero. Some focus on countries,\nothers on cities, and others on cultures. Some are more left-leaning in\nideology, others are more right-leaning. In many ways, it's like where\nthe crypto space was five to ten years ago.\n\nLeft: magic internet money. Right: magic internet\nsociety.\n\nIn 2023, seeing all of these ideas mature inspired me to run Zuzalu,\nan experimental \"popup city\" in Montenegro: bring ~200 people, from\nmultiple communities - Ethereum, longevity, rationalism, AI - together\nin one place for two months, and see what happens. Zuzalu succeeded as\nan experiment, and in my visits to various other \"new city\" projects I\noften heard the feedback that it inspired them to take culture and\ncommunity building more seriously. But the experiment left unanswered a\nkey question: what happens next?\n\nIn this post, I give my updated picture of this space. I will first\nreview what I think we have learned since 2023, when the space moved\nfrom vibes and whitepapers to real-world experimentation. I will then\nsketch out a concrete world that this movement could be driving towards,\nwhat new types of entities will emerge, and what concrete value they can\nprovide.\n\nZuzalu in 2023 was an experiment: bring ~200 people, from multiple\ncommunities -Ethereum, longevity, rationalism, AI - together in one\nplace for two months, and see what happens. This was the first time\nsomething like this had happened in this way - almost all events are\neither much smaller in scale, much shorter, or both - and the closest\nother historical examples are in spheres far removed from the kind of\nfrontier technology that Zuzalu was built around.\n\nI enjoyed my experience at Zuzalu - though sometimes the\nsocialization did get to the point where it was too much for me. I\nlearned a lot about different people's interests, and got to know many\nwarm and friendly and interesting people. There are a lot of \"little\nthings\" that we learned about how to organize a popup well. For\nexample:\n\nAfter the original Zuzalu in Montenegro, we kept going organizing\n\"popups\", and it feels like popups seem to have found \"product market\nfit\" within their niche. One of the Zu spinoffs, Edge City, has perfected a\npipeline of organizing them, and I have heard that they are at this\npoint a cash-flow-positive business. And popups - like-minded people\nliving together for medium durations - have proven themselves as a\nstepping stone toward a more full-fledged community.\n\nA panel on cryptography at ZuConnect and the ZuSocial hacker\nhouse, Istanbul 2023.\n\nIt also became abundantly clear that there are limits to what popups\ncan do:\n\nAnother pattern I have noticed is that two things core to the\nearly ideology often fall away over time: novel governance designs, and\na search for legal autonomy. Within the context of popups, this\nmakes total sense. If a popup is short-duration, then \"forking as\ngovernance\" works perfectly fine. Each popup can be run by a founder or\ncore team, and if anyone is unhappy, they can make their own version and\ntry to attract people over. The longevity-focused Zu spinoff Vitalia\nalready split\ninto two forks. And if a popup only lasts 30 days, then there is not\nmuch interesting that could be done that would benefit from legal\ninnovation.\n\nAs a result of all this, I have noticed a worrying pattern: over\ntime, popups would get shorter in duration, smaller in scope, and more\ngeneric in substance, to the point where in the limit they approach\nbeing simply a few more conferences and hackerspaces. Outside the\nZuzalu-verse, I saw Praxis aspiring to big\ndreams of a new Mediterranean renaissance, but in practice mostly\ndelivering parties in upscale cities in the United States. (Since then,\nthey seem to have switched\nto pursuing the American military dynamism topic)\n\nFor all of these reasons, I have started advocating for\nZuzalu-inspired communities to start having permanent nodes. There\nalready are a few: Frontier\nTower, Crecimiento, and\n4seas' two nodes (one city, one\nmountain) in Chiang Mai, with others under construction\n(additionally, of course, there is Balaji's Network School). But even with these, in the\nback of my mind I always fear the \"regression to the mean\" that they\nwill turn into glorified coworkingspaces, and lose all of their cultural\nor experimental interestingness. Making sure that this does not happen\nis an ongoing challenge, and indeed it is a primary goal of this post to\npaint a clearer picture of what alternative future these projects could\nbe driving toward.\n\nNow, let's get into actually explaining what I think this future can\nbe.\n\nThe 4seas mountain venue features flags of many of the\ncommunities that it sees itself as connected with: Bitcoin,\nEthereum, Plancker, 706\n\nOne common critique of modern society is that it is at the same time\natomistic and authoritarian: there is a lack of intermediate\ninstitutions, in between individuals and states, that give people needed\nservices and community. In the critics' story, this makes society:\n\nAll three problems stem from the fact that we have too much of a\ntwo-level structure: individuals, very powerful large-scale actors like\nstates, and nothing else.\n\nHistorically, these \"intermediate institutions\" included local\ngovernments, clubs, churches, small businesses and various other\nassociations. Today, we still have many of those, but they are\ninherently local in scale, and so they are failing to capture the most\nmeaningful communities today, which are increasingly continental and\nglobal. We have corporations, including very big corporations, and we\nalso have social media. But these are impersonal, homogenizing forces:\nthe profit motive drives them to appeal to as many people as possible,\nreducing their diversity and uniqueness toward zero. Startups are small\nand diverse, but according to the\nstandard playbook, encouraged by venture-capital profit motives, a\nstartup is a group of people attempting to become a new megacorporation,\nnot some reliable third sector of society.\n\nSo what would a successful \"intermediate institution\" of this type,\nadapted for the needs of the 21ˢᵗ century, look like? I will propose my\nanswer. It needs to be some kind of neo-tribe or other\ninstitution that focuses, and meaningfully innovates, on the thing that\nhumans do that isn't generic: culture.\n\nLeft: gym at Balaji's Network\nSchool. Right: Town hall at ShanhaiWoo Chiang\nMai.\n\nThe Wiktionary\ndefinition of \"culture\" begins as follows:\n\nIn short, culture is the patterns of human behavior in a particular\ncommunity. It covers everything from the food you eat, the language you\nspeak, dance, music, architecture, to much \"deeper\" things like how\npeople conceive the stories of their own lives, their relationships with\ntheir families, business, politics, and how people resolve conflicts in\nall of these spheres.\n\nMany people make the mistake of thinking culture is something that\ncan be explicitly laid down by mission statements and top-down edicts.\nLet's take, for example, the corporate culture of Enron (explanation for\nyounger readers: Enron was the FTX of your parents'\nera).\n\nOn paper, Enron valued \"integrity, communication, respect and\nexcellence\". In practice, Enron clearly valued some very different\nthings. But this is only the most egregious example; the inevitable wide\ndivergence between \"organizational culture\" written on paper and an\norganization's culture in practice is very easy to see anywhere.\n\nAnother problem with top-down attempts to shape culture, especially\nmore coercive ones, is that the whole strategy has very low galaxy-brain\nresistance. While declaring top-down \"the culture I wrote down in\nthis document is better than what you have now, so I will impose it\" may\nat times be the right thing to do (see: the anti-smoking push,\nfederally-driven anti-segregation\nin the 1960s USA, etc), the problem is that it's too easy for\nsomeone to get convinced that their own culture, as they understand it,\nis great, and then use it as an excuse to dominate others.\n\nOn the other hand, many people make the mistake of over-identifying\nculture with the purely aesthetic, subjective and\ngroup-identity-oriented parts of culture: food, music, dance, dress,\narchitecture styles, and ignore the parts that are functional, whose\nsuccess or failure drives the success and failure of civilizations. This\ncan lead to an over-egalitarian and stagnant \"culture as museum\"\nmentality: every culture is equally as good as every other culture\nbecause aesthetics are ultimately subjective, and so there is no such\nthing as cultural improvement - instead, the only goal is\npreservation.\n\nThat is the sort of thing that Thomas Sowell rails\nagainst:\n\nCultures are not museum pieces. They are the working machinery of\neveryday life. Unlike objects of aesthetic contemplation, working\nmachinery is judged by how well it works, compared to the\nalternatives.\n\nCultures are there to serve their people, not touristic onlookers\nappreciating their existence from far away. Some cultures do this much\nbetter than others, and all cultures could do much better still. There\nare just too many examples of traditional culture being pathological\n(here's the latest\nI just happened to see while writing this) for preservation to be\nthe only goal. And even if it were not, technology - growing wealth,\ndigital communications, birth control, education, the list goes on - has\nchanged the world so much that any lessons from our collective memory in\nthe past millennium need to be radically adapted to be relevant in the\nnext.\n\nOn the third hand, some make the mistake of acknowledging that\nculture is functional, but over-emphasizing very small-scale\nindividual decisions as a vehicle of change. This is what Scott\nAlexander calls \"universal\nculture\":\n\nUniversal culture is the collection of the most competitive ideas and\nproducts. Coca-Cola spreads because it tastes better than whatever\npeople were drinking before. Egalitarian gender norms spread because\nthey're more popular and likeable than their predecessors. If there was\nsomething that outcompeted Coca-Cola, then that would be the official\nsoda of universal culture and Coca-Cola would be consigned to the\nscrapheap of history.\n\nInstead of keeping culture the way it is, or reforming it from the\ntop down, why not embrace the wisdom of accumulated individual choice\nand freedom?\n\nHere is how I would argue the case against an overly purist version\nof this approach. There are many things that require \"immersion\" to\nsucceed: lifestyle habits, local public goods such as air quality, work\nhabits, lifetime learning habits, limitations on use of technology, etc.\nDoing anything truly interesting and unique requires \"depth\", and\nsubstantial collective investment and effort to create an entire\nenvironment oriented around better serving those needs. These things\ncannot easily be done by an individual, or even by a corporation,\nbecause corporations face too much pressure to \"meet users where they\nare\" - and so we get everyone drinking Coca Cola (or getting addicted to\noutrage-driven social media, or ...)\n\nAs we see clearly with architecture styles (but happens in every\nsphere), relying too much on market incentives leads to global\nmonoculture.\n\nSo what's going on here? And if we want to avoid these three\npitfalls, what might cultural evolution done well look like?\n\nThe social philosopher Charles\nTaylor talks about culture as being underpinned by moral\norders and social imaginaries. Taylor defines\na \"social imaginary\" as:\n\nthe ways in which [people] imagine their social existence, how they\nfit together with others, how things go on between them and their\nfellows, the expectations which are normally met, and the deeper\nnormative notions and images which underlie these expectations\n\nTake our practice of choosing governments through general elections ...\nEssential to our understanding what is involved in this kind of\nmacro-decision is our ability to identify what would constitute a foul:\ncertain kinds of influence, buying votes, threats, and the like. This\nkind of macro-decision has, in other words, to meet certain norms, if it\nis to be what it is meant to be ... And beyond the ideal stands some\nnotion of a moral or metaphysical order, in the context of which the\nnorms and ideals make sense.\n\nAn important point that Taylor makes is that social imaginaries are\noften transformed when \"what start off as theories held by a few people\nmay come to infiltrate the social imaginary, first of elites perhaps,\nand then of the whole society\". Taylor talks at length about how modern\nEuropean liberal democratic norms emerged in the 17ᵗʰ century as a\nresult of this process transforming the European \"moral order\". However,\nTaylor cautions, this process of transformation is\norganic and complicated:\n\nWhat exactly is involved when a theory penetrates and transforms the\nsocial imaginary? For the most part, people take up, improvise, or are\ninducted into new practices. These are made sense of by the new outlook,\nthe one first articulated in the theory; this outlook is the context\nthat gives sense to the practices ... But this process isn't just one\nsides, a theory making over a social imaginary. In coming to make sense\nof the action the theory is glossed, as it were, given a particular\nshape as the context of these practices ... Nor need the process end here.\nThe new practice, with the implicit understanding it generates, can be\nthe basis for modifications of theory, which in turn can inflect\npractice, and so on.\n\nIn short, culture is a big complicated blob where actions,\nconsequences, statements by leaders and theories by intellectuals all\ninfluence each other in every direction. If a culture\nofficially says to do one thing, but actually people\ndo something else, then the latter is more decisive. Culture is\nshaped by incentives, but then incentives are themselves implemented by\npeople, who are guided by culture. Culture is housed in a community,\nwhich is held together because people feel affinity for each other, and\nthat affinity is itself shaped by shared rituals.\n\nI remember experiencing some of this (ok fine, the solitary parts of\nthis) myself with my experiences as a teenager attempting to build constructed\nlanguages - like Esperanto, but\nbetter. I easily recognized how English is pathological with its horribly broken and irregular\nspelling system (and many other issues), and how centuries of\norganic evolution has only made the problem worse. But when I tried to\ncreate an \"ideal language\" from scratch, I ended up creating something\nthat can make beautiful logical and compact sentences in the specific\ncases I designed it around, but which takes three times longer than\nEnglish to express any other thought that I needed to express in\neveryday life.\n\nThis shows why all three of the above approaches to culture are\ninsufficient:\n\nNotice how \"top-down culture\", \"cultural traditionalism\" and\n\"cultural individualism\" map really nicely to the three corners of\n\"the\nd/acc triangle\", which also argues that all three are\ninsufficient and we need to do something else.\n\nAnd so I think we need a different path. What we want is a\nbetter \"world game\" for cultural evolution: an environment\nwhere cultures improve and compete, but not on the basis of violent\nforce, and also not exclusively on low-level forms of memetic\nfitness (eg. virality of individual posts on social media,\nmoment-by-moment enjoyment and convenience), but rather on some kind of\nfair playing field that creates sufficient space to showcase the\nlonger-term benefits that a thriving culture provides.\n\nOne early modern version of this idea is the notion of\n\"prefigurational cultures\". A seminal work is Margaret\nMead's Culture and Commitment from 1970:\n\nIn the past, in configurational cultures, the elderly were gradually\ncut off from limiting the future of their children. Now, as I see it,\nthe development of prefigurational cultures will depend on the existence\nof a continuing dialogue in which the young, free to act on their own\ninitiative, can lead their elders in the direction of the unknown.\n\nWhat might a prefigurational culture in the real world look like?\nHere, there are many possible different answers. To show one end of the\nspectrum, let me re-paste Balaji's example from years ago:\n\nStart with a history of the horrible USDA Food Pyramid, the\ngrain-heavy monstrosity that gave cover to the corporate sugarification\nof the globe and the obesity epidemic. ... Organize a community online\nthat crowdfunds properties around the world, like apartment buildings\nand gyms, and perhaps eventually even culdesacs and small towns. You\nmight take an extreme sugar teeotaler approach, literally banning\nprocessed foods and sugar at the border, thereby implementing a kind of\n\"Keto Kosher\".\n\nYou can imagine variants of this startup society that are like\n\"Carnivory Communities\" or \"Paleo People\". These would be competing\nstartup societies in the same broad area, iterations on a theme. If\nsuccessful, such a society might not stop at sugar. It could get into\nsetting cultural defaults for fitness and exercise. Or perhaps it could\nbulk purchase continuous glucose meters for all members, or orders of\nmetformin.\n\nBut cultural innovation does not have to be \"legible\" in the way that\nKeto Kosher is. In fact, as we have seen, over-indexing on legibility\nand on explicit ideology often leads to problems. Cultural innovation\nworks better when it arises out of a collection of habits, attitudes and\ngoals that are shared by a particular group, and adapted to the group's\nneeds. The group's goal might be realistically a 50/50 mix of being\n\"about a set of values\" and being \"about the group\" - it's not\nattempting to expand to unlimited size, rather, it's a group of people\nwith shared history and shared identity trying to do their thing and\nmake the best of it.\n\nThe Zuzalu-verse is actually one of the better proto-examples of\nthis. It is organized around a particular set of values: the \"Ethereum\ncanon\" of open source, freedom, decentralization and a positive-sum\nattitude toward humanity, idealistic hacker culture, concern about\nhealth, etc. The Zuzalu identity is demonstrably not universal. Many\npeople who frequent the Zuzalu-verse reported finding themselves out of\nplace at Network School, which is organized around principles that are\nsimilar on paper, but very different in their \"vibes\" - and undoubtedly\nothers feel the same way in the other direction. But there isn't a fixed\n\"One\nCommandment\", or even any specific written-down mission and vision\nstatement. Aspects of it could be described as \"Keto Kosher but for\neducation\", attempting to integrate constant learning into week-by-week\nlife (a very important thing for us to get right in the 21ˢᵗ century!),\nbut even this is done in a very organic style. Just as much as the\ngoals, the community is organized around its people.\n\nEventually, I also expect tribes to get back to innovating in\ngovernance: using a combination of culture and technological\nmeans (blockchains, LLMs, ZK...) to have better collective conversation\nand decision-making. Currently, this part of the space is in somewhat of\na \"trough of disillusionment\", as we have realized the downfalls of\nformalizing governance too early. However, I would argue that we have\nnot yet properly tried to integrate AI and ZK tech into voting\nprocesses, which could solve their two biggest problems: attention\noverload and fatigue, and collapse into social games where people vote\nbased on how their vote will be perceived (if not outright bribery),\nrather than their genuine convictions. I expect this to pick back up at\nsome point, as it will be necessary for tribes to be long-term\nsustainable without having the same pitfalls as corporations. I also\nthink tribes may be a better ground for this kind of governance\nexperimentation than eg. blockchain-based DAOs, because tribes'\ncapabilities and needs are more complex.\n\n4seas Nimman in Chiang Mai. Visibly a \"regen\" space, visibly an\n\"Ethereum-ish\" space, visibly not your average cowork.\n\nTruly instantiating a culture with any level of depth requires not\njust talking about the culture's themes, but actually\nliving them. This requires deep immersion,\ninstantiating the culture's values and aesthetics and practices at a\nlevel that goes far beyond a few decorations and posters. For\nexample:\n\nThis is all why I think it is a critical part of digital tribes to\nhave long-lasting physical spaces. Physical spaces allow a culture's\nvalues and habits to be instantiated in a much deeper way.\n\nThe good news about a hub is that you need a surprisingly small size\nto be viable. If a hub is located inside a city, they can be arbitrarily\nsmall, because residents can take advantage of the surrounding\ninfrastructure of a city. If a hub is located outside a city, then it's\nbasically building a new city. But even here, there is good news. For a\nconventional city to play a significant role at the frontier of\nanything, you need to have a population of at least a million; that is\nthe level at which it's possible to have effective network effects\nwithin any particular niche. But if you are specialized to one or a few\nniches (I think a novel combination of a few niches is better than being\noverly focused on one), the minimum size is much smaller. Here are some\nexamples of viable cities I've visited that are quite small:\n\n2,600 is a great size: Longyearbyen is able to sustain ~10\nrestaurants, an airport, a hospital and a school (2,600 total ~= 26 per\nyear of age).\n\nBut 100 people is probably not enough. I recently visited Prospera in\nHonduras (population ~100), and while the physical venue was beautiful,\nsurprisingly strong on cultural uniqueness, and even strong on\nengagement with locals (a Honduran was on the core leadership team, many\nwere in the core community, and at least one of the medical businesses\nwas run by Hondurans), the place I was staying had one restaurant with\nlimited food options and no other amenities within walking distance.\nHence I think one or two further steps of growth and maturity beyond the\n100-person level is ideal.\n\nI expect getting hubs right to be the next important step for these\nkinds of \"tribes\" to succeed, and an important training ground for them\nto figure out culture, governance and other issues at a much deeper\nlevel.\n\nFrom top left to bottom right: (i) the micronation Liberland,\n(ii) Prospera,\na zone in Honduras, (iii) artist's drawing of the\nunder-construction California\nForever, (iv) artist's drawing of Bhutan's\ngovernment-initiated under-construction Gelephu Mindfulness City. All\nare what I call \"zones\", but represent very different points on the\nspectrum of engagement with governments.\n\nFrom top left to bottom right: (i) the micronation Liberland,\n(ii) Prospera,\na zone in Honduras, (iii) artist's drawing of the\nunder-construction California\nForever, (iv) artist's drawing of Bhutan's\ngovernment-initiated under-construction Gelephu Mindfulness City. All\nare what I call \"zones\", but represent very different points on the\nspectrum of engagement with governments.\n\nSo far, we have talked about innovating in culture. The more\nradical part of the free cities and network states space started by\nasking a different question: how do we get more innovation in\nrules - that is, the regulations, laws, and political systems\nthat govern the physical spaces that we are in?\n\nIn my observation, there are three schools of thought here:\n\nOne\nview of a social technology perspective on\ngovernance.\n\nOften, the three perspectives merge. Some social technologists are\ninterested in governance ideas in a libertarian-ish direction, because\nthey see ideal forms of governance is being precisely those forms that\ntry to align incentives and beyond that point minimize arbitrary\nconstraints. Some libertarians believe in freedom because they see it as\ncritical for economic development.\n\nMy attempt at creating a political compass of some of the\nprojects I am more familiar with.\n\nBasically, for a country, it's a way of participating in the rapid\nand accelerating economic and technological revolution of the 21ˢᵗ\ncentury. In particular, it lets you go beyond tourism, which imports\nindividuals but not the networks between those\nindividuals, and instead actually import parts of the networks\nthemselves, opening up the opportunity to capture a larger share of the\nvalue.\n\nUnder British rule, and then for the first two decades of Chinese\nrule, Hong Kong served as a crucial entrepot — the\nworld's gateway to China. It facilitated the inflow of foreign capital,\nwhich was absolutely crucial to China's early industrialization. It was\na major hub for goods to move into and out of China. It provided\nservices for foreigners to do business on the mainland. And it imported\nforeign know-how into China, teaching locals how to build high-quality\ninfrastructure, set up factories, and do business overseas.\n\nSo I thought about Hong Kong, and wondered: What if every\ncountry had a quasi-independent city like that?\n\nImagine a Hong Kong in India. A Hong Kong or two in Europe. A Hong\nKong in Brazil, Japan, Indonesia, the United States, and so on. Each\ncity would formally be a part of the host country, subject to the laws\nand authority of the central government there. But in practice, each\ncity would be granted a degree of autonomy.\n\nThis sounds like social science fiction, but Bhutan's Gelephu Mindfulness City is an attempt to do\npretty much exactly this. The problem that GMC is trying to solve is, as\ndescribed to me by the Bhutan government, is twofold:\n\nBasically, let the expats come and the thirty-storey towers go up, at\nleast in one corner of the country along the border with India, but\ndon't let the next generation of the whole country get hooked on Coca\nCola.\n\nIncidentally, this is all why I am expecting \"zones\" to be the bulk\nof the future of jurisdictional innovation, and not new \"countries\".\nCountries are very unwilling to literally give up their sovereignty over\neven small patches of their land. Liberland has found a hack: take over\none of the very small pieces of land that, by pure accident of how the\nlines were drawn, no country claims as its own. But there are\nnot many opportunities like that, and even that is far\nfrom a guarantee of safety. To really have a country, you\nhave to either get approval from your new neighbors, or figure out your\nown military. Zones, on the other hand, are much more palatable for\npoliticians, and also enable a government to actually get ongoing upside\nin the networks that it attracts, rather than just a one-time deal (eg.\nProspera pays 12% of its tax revenue to the government of Honduras).\n\nI will give a few examples that I personally find interesting, on a\nscale from \"boring\" to \"experimental\".\n\nIn many developed countries, a major challenge is that housing\nconstruction is very difficult for legal reasons. Some have estimated\nthat fixing this could make cities much more affordable, and improve\nGDP by as much as 36%. But changing laws in an existing city is\nhard, in large part because of existing stakeholders. So what if you can\ncreate a new city?\n\nThis is a big part of the\npitch for California\nForever. The other part of the pitch is all the other problems that\nurban economists have consistently railed about for decades. One that\nCalifornia Forever, and others like Culdesac, focus on is walkability (and\nbikeability). A third is attracting business including heavy industry\nthat people can work in. A fourth and more experimental option is\nfriendliness to new technologies (eg. drone delivery). There is a whole\nlist of ideas that policy thinkers have basically agreed on for decades,\nthat many are frustrated that they cannot implement in existing cities\nbecause things are hard to change. With a new city, you can - and it\nonly requires city-level autonomy, which is in many places quite easy to\nget, and not anything national-scale.\n\nLeft: where a Singaporean can go (for short-term visit) without a\nvisa. Right: where an Indian can go without a visa.\n\nOne problem that many people have in the 21ˢᵗ century: where do you\ngo to live? Whether it's because of lack of economic opportunity,\npolitical instability, a culture unforgiving to people who are\ndifferent, or a government unfriendly to their business aspirations or\neven their way of life (or, for the luckier among us, a simple thirst\nfor adventure), for many people around the world, the country of their\nbirth does not suit them.\n\nAttracting these people is a massive economic opportunity. Many\ncountries around the world are becoming more restrictive (or even\nhostile) to both long-term and short-term immigration, but the number of\npeople who need more options for where to be is only increasing. Better\nserving such people also fosters global redistribution of\ntalent: creating a future where the most important\ntechnological and economic work is done from everywhere, and its\nproceeds more widely shared, instead of being concentrated in a few\nsuperstar cities in a few very powerful countries.\n\nThere is also a social technology angle to this. Many people have\nconcerns about inviting more people: the risk that they will stay longer\nthan expected and become illegal immigrants (including running to\nneighboring countries), risks related to safety, cultural\nincompatibility, etc. Today, we use \"which country are you from?\" as a\nfilter to determine who is high-risk and who is low-risk. But this is\nincredibly inefficient and unjust - it's the exact opposite of \"judging\npeople not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their\ncharacter\". In a modern digitized society, we have many kinds of filters\nto identify people who might be low-risk: work history, education,\npeople vouching for them, etc. I expect that whichever country or zone\ncreates an easy user-friendly mechanism for talented people from\neverywhere to easily be able to come (eg. to work for a local company,\nor for a conference, or for a popup) will gain a lot of benefits.\n\nOne idea that some economists like Robin Hanson support as a\nsubstitute for much of our regulation is vouching\n(aka mandatory liability insurance): you can do what you want, as\nlong as you find someone (eg. an insurance company) with enough capital\nwho agrees to pay potentially large fines and compensate any victims if\nyou create a problem.\n\nThis addresses a key problem with a libertarian approach to law: if\nyou only punish people when they actually create a problem, then the\ncost of the harm can easily be so great that there's no way to penalize\nsomeone enough to adequately incentivize caution. If the only regulation\non driving were that if you cause an accident you go to jail, it would\ndeter drunk driving (or driving without a license, or flying in unsafe\nversions of weird newfangled 3D aircraft) too little.\n\nIt also addresses a problem with the current approach of creating\napplication-specific rules for everything: the rules do not adapt well\nto new technology, and easily get corrupted and twisted into goals that\nhave nothing to do with safety, like protecting incumbent businesses.\nHere, the rules that people follow would be created by vouchers,\nincentivized by their need to balance between attracting customers and\nmanaging risks, rather than by politicians. The political lever is\nindirect, and more compatible with a free society: it sets the\nobjective, but not how you get there.\n\nIf successful, this is a really cool idea that could improve a lot of\nthings. But to see if it works, we have to try it somewhere, at a\nsufficient scale and level of realism. This is actually what Prospera,\nthe autonomous zone in Honduras (see website, review by\nScott Alexander) is trying to do. Currently, the experiment is still\nvery young, and there is only one insurance company (run by the zone\nitself), but this is exactly the kind of thing that a self-contained\nzone is the ideal place to try.\n\nOne of the core political challenges of the 21ˢᵗ century is how to\nimprove democracy. Here's Eliezer Yudkowsky way of stating the\nproblem:\n\nEliezer's proposed\nsolution is a new twist on liquid\ndemocracy. Approximately:\n\nAgain, this is a really cool idea: it biases for sophistication\n(because each level would end up more sophisticated than the previous)\nand guards against populism (because a delegate can't amass extreme\npower by gaining a huge following directly) but in a way that avoids\nempowering pre-selected aristocracies. But to see how well it works, we\nneed to try it somewhere.\n\nAgain, you don't have to believe in this exact idea, just that there\nare things of this level of craziness that are at least worthy trying in\na serious way, somewhere.\n\nProjects building zones, especially those leaning more libertarian or\nnot initiated by governments, often get criticized - for being havens\nfor billionaires, unregulated zones where things will inevitably go very\nwrong, or for being neo-colonial. These criticisms sometimes apply to\ntribes and hubs too. I can understand the sentiment behind these\ncritiques, and I think there are important risks worth worrying about.\nHowever, I disagree with many of the stronger criticisms\n- and it is worth explaining why.\n\nAt heart, I am a pluralist. I believe that when different people\ndisagree about how things should be done, it's healthy to have a bias\ntoward solutions where both versions exist at least somewhere, and\npeople can freely choose between them. If a powerful (commercial or\npolitical or cultural) actor wants to see their culture or economic or\npolitical ideology implemented, the most productive and least risky\nimaginable way for them to do it is to peacefully make something\nsmall in a corner somewhere, and see how it plays out. By building a\nwhole new zone from scratch, you are taking on a huge inconvenience, and\na huge tax in terms of forgoing all kinds of network effects. And since\nyou are growing not by amassing a country-sized blog or podcast\naudience, but instead entering the real world at a much earlier stage,\nwe all gain valuable rapid feedback about whether or not the whole idea\nis crazy. This all feels like the sort of role you want\nsemi-influential radical mavericks to be playing in our society.\n\nWhat's the role we don't want them to play? One strategy I\ndeeply fear is what many in the so-called Silicon\nValley Tech Right have recently pivoted to: stop trying to route\naround the government, and instead just take over the government.\nThis is deeply scary: instead of corporations and the state serving as a\nhealthy check and balance against each other, the two collude against\neveryone else. It also means that ideas go straight from being\ntwelve-thousand-word screeds or five hour podcasts to running entire\ncountries.\n\nAnd in my experience, these two modes of action are substitutes:\npeople who start working on tribes and zones suddenly get visibly\nmore positive-sum and less interested in country\ntakeovers.\n\nLots of people on the internet lately seem to pine for a world\n(or a nation) where we force everyone to be more like Durmstrang.\nI'd rather let someone enthusiastic about that approach make the best of\nit, and have to inspire people to come voluntarily, than pontificate on\nthe internet and build up a large political movement based on how\nappealing that idea sounds written in words, with no feedback from how\nit works in reality. Long small-scale voluntary attempts at Durmstrang,\nshort Gilead.\n\nLots of people on the internet lately seem to pine for a world\n(or a nation) where we force everyone to be more like Durmstrang.\nI'd rather let someone enthusiastic about that approach make the best of\nit, and have to inspire people to come voluntarily, than pontificate on\nthe internet and build up a large political movement based on how\nappealing that idea sounds written in words, with no feedback from how\nit works in reality. Long small-scale voluntary attempts at Durmstrang,\nshort Gilead.\n\nIn general, business and politics are the scariest at scale:\nmonopolizing industries, overwriting entire societies, or recklessly\nbuilding superintelligent AI (which eventually anyone will be able to\nbuild, but in any realistic universe the global centers of power will\nget to long before everyone else). Zones are the opposite of scale.\nWhatever you say about CHAZ,\nits downsides were far lower than what you would get if the\nsame people took over an entire country or even city government.\n\nIn an ideal world, zones can be a tool that can help countries and\nstates get more integrated into a global economy, and can give their\nbrightest people a path to frontier science and technology and business\nthat does not involve disappearing to a university and then a corporate\necosystem in a country halfway across the world. Creating opportunities\nfor frontier tech and business to happen locally instead of entirely\ndepending on powerful nations abroad can be a far more meaningful\ngain to national sovereignty than full uniformity of rules across\nthe entire country without even a few otherwise-undeveloped square\nkilometers of exceptions.\n\nBut achieving this outcome requires actively shaping it. I see\nopportunities for improvement here from both sides. Countries should not\nbe able to suddenly rugpull everyone in a zone if their political mood\nchanges, but they could have have levers of influence to\nencourage them to behave cooperatively, perhaps privileges defined\nnumerically that each administration can adjust up or down a medium\namount. Ideally, there would be ways to more explicitly encourage\neducation and tech transfer to local and regional talent. For\n\"developmentalist\" zones that are less radical but need to get access to\na larger local population, more limited sector-specific forms of\nautonomy is worth exploring.\n\nFrom a zone's perspective, this is another place where bottom-up\ndecentralized governance ideas can shine: they could help people working\non zones (or even hubs) are more able to determine what local\npopulations value and want, and try to proactively serve it, rather than\nwaiting for potential political backlash after the fact. Prospera has\nvoluntarily chosen to pay 12% of its taxes to the Honduran government,\nand passed internal laws to disallow it\nto expropriate anyone's land, but it could attempt to use newer\ntools to engage the population on a larger scale to better identify\nforms of value it could provide, and risks it should avoid.\n\nSo far, I have told two disjoint stories. One is about smaller-scale\ncommunity-driven projects, and experimentation in culture. Another is\nabout larger-scale politics and business-driven projects, and\nexperimentation in rules.\n\nIt may seem like the story I am going for is that the two will\nconverge. But actually, while some \"vertically integrated\" zones that\ncombine both will exist, I predict that in general the \"market\nstructure\" will split tribes and zones into distinct categories, because\nthese are different things that require different specialties that are\ncomplementary. Figuring out legal frameworks to make it easy\nfor people from any country around the world to come to one place is one\ntype of skill. Actually building a global community is another: Edge\nCity and ShanhaiWoo have access to great technical talent, but they are\nnot constitutional lawyers.\n\nWe have already seen this \"market structure\" in the Zuzalu world:\nthere is at least a partial separation between \"hubs\", which provide\npermanent space, and \"popups\", which are communities that sometimes need\nspace for some period of time. Network School, 4seas and other nodes\nregularly host popups inside of them. I expect collaboration between\nzones and tribes (including tribes that expand to permanent hubs) to\nfollow a similar pattern.\n\nI argue that this strategy is ideal for countries that want to\nmaximize the success of their zone. Their goal should not just be to\nimport individuals, rather it should be to import\nnetworks. Furthermore, because most of them cannot compete with\nthe world's largest cities at creating generic networks, they\nneed to focus on more focused issue-specific networks.\nAttracting tribes, including schemes like collective visas (the\ngovernment approves the tribe, the tribe then provides its list of\n100-1000 people who automatically get admitted), can be a very effective\nway of doing this.\n\nRecently, Francis Fukuyama wrote\na post arguing that \"liberalism needs community, but it doesn't need\na ‘strong god' telling everyone what to do\". Scott Alexander wrote\na piece commenting on it. Both are good, so I'll quote Scott quoting\nFukuyama and replying at length:\n\nAccording to R. R. Reno, editor of the magazine First\nThings, the liberal project of the past three generations has\nsought to weaken the \"strong\nGods\" of populism, nationalism, and religion that were held to be\nthe drivers of the bloody conflicts of the early 20th\ncentury. Those gods are now returning, and are present in the politics\nof both the progressive left and far right—particularly the right, which\nis characterized today by demands for strong national identities or\nreligious foundations for national communities.\n\nHowever, there is a cogent liberal response to the charge that\nliberalism undermines community. The problem is that, just as in the\n1930s, that response has not been adequately articulated by the\ndefenders of liberalism. Liberalism is not intrinsically opposed to\ncommunity; indeed, there is a version of liberalism that encourages the\nflourishing of strong community and human virtue. That community emerges\nthrough the development of a strong and well-organized civil society,\nwhere individuals freely choose to bond with other like-minded\nindividuals to seek common ends. People are free to follow \"strong\nGods\"; the only caveat is that there is no single strong god that binds\nthe entire society together.\n\nIn other words - yes, part of the good life is participation in a\ntight-knit community with strong values. Liberalism's shared values are\ncomparatively weak, and its knitting comparatively loose. But that's no\nargument against the liberal project. Its goal isn't to become this kind\nof community itself, but to be the platform where communities like this\ncan grow up. So in a liberal democracy, Christians can have their\nchurch, Jews their synagogue, Communists their commune, and so on.\nEveryone gets the tight-knit community they want - which beats\nilliberalism, where (at most) one group gets the community they\nwant and everyone else gets persecuted.\n\nOn a theoretical level, this is a great answer. On a practical level\n- is it really working? Are we really a nation dotted with tight-knit\ncommunities of strong values? The average person has a church they don't\nattend and a political philosophy that mainly cashes out in Twitter\ndunks. Otherwise they just consume whatever slop the current year's\nversion of capitalism chooses to throw at them.\n\nScott then lists a few partial exceptions, and laments that they have\nnot been much more successful. His conclusion is that it's not working\nyet because we're not wealthy enough, and when we get wealthier and\nmoving people around to custom communities with custom infrastructure\nbecomes cheaper, it will happen.\n\nBut I also think there is something different at play: people just\nhave to get off their butts and actually create these alternative\ncultures and environments, and doing it is hard. Startups are also hard.\nBut startups have had a multi-billion-pdollar capitalist optimization\nmachine figuring out all the most optimized ways of doing them and\nrapidly growing them to scale, and turned them into cookie-cutter\nstandardized playbooks. Culture does not have the same profit motive,\nand culture is inherently not easy to scale.\n\nSome argue that NFTs solve this and make culture profitable, but\nthe fact that Zundamon's\nTheorem was not made as an NFT makes me pessimistic that\nNFT-driven culture will solve the problems that I want cultural\ninnovation to solve.\n\nSome argue that NFTs solve this and make culture profitable, but\nthe fact that Zundamon's\nTheorem was not made as an NFT makes me pessimistic that\nNFT-driven culture will solve the problems that I want cultural\ninnovation to solve.\n\nA parallel problem exists for progress in economic and political\nrules, which have also stagnated under supposedly \"dynamic\" capitalist\nliberalism. The problem is that development of new and better economic\nand political rules, whether at city-scale or at country-scale,\nsimilarly does not have a strong profit motive. It definitely does not\nhave a rapid experimentation loop that startups have or even that many\n(but not all) aspects of culture have.\n\nI do not literally expect we are going to see a world where most\npeople live in tribes, or even zones. I definitely do not\nexpect normal people to be plotting themselves on a political compass of\n\"goldbug libertarianism\", \"hipster socialism\", \"Durmstrang-ism\",\n\"techno-Leninism\" etc, and joining whichever community is closest to\nthem on a 2D map. For most people, such grand ideologies are far from\nprimary in their lives. But I do expect a world that is somewhat more\ndynamic in both economic and political rules and in cultural dimensions,\nand that gives people more options.\n\nSuch a world would be a world where (i) people have more meaningful\nfreedom, both to escape persecution and to choose the kinds of\nenvironments that they truly enjoy living in, (ii) we get better\ninnovation both in economic and political rules and in culture, and\n(iii) instead of the innovation and creativity of the world being\nconcentrated in a few super-centers of global economic and political\npower, it is globally distributed everywhere across the world. This is a\nworld that I want to live in.",

    "description": "How to build responsive typography with fluid units and typed arithmetic in CSS.",
    "fullText": "What we call fluid typography are a set of tricks in CSS that allows to adapt the type size and leading when the screen size changes. So instead of having fixed breakpoints where the font-size abruptly, we want to have a smooth increase between different screen sizes, removing blind spots near the breakpoints where the font was disproportionally big or small.\n\nThe most basic implementation of fluid typography is to take a base size and a base screen width. If we divide the screen size (100vw) by the base size, we will have a ratio that will tell us how big is the screen related to the base size. Until recently, we had to take care in order not to multiply or divide two numbers with units, as this created an error. This has been solved in Chrome 140, creating exciting possibilities as outlined in this post by Amit Sheen, but support is still not baseline as I write this lines, so we will then just have to take care using unitless numbers for our base-screen-size and our base-font-size, in order to be able to operate with vw. This point is important and we'll come back to it later.\n\nWith this setup, we can have a text-size equal to 16px in our desired base-size that will grow and shrink linearlly with the size of our viewport. This has the obvious drawback that size will grow and shrink indefinetely, making it not very usable as it is. We could restrict that behaviour with @media-queries, setting it fluid between two breakpoints, and setting it fixed on the rest, but fortunately modern CSS allows to write this in a much more elegant way.\n\nWith clamp() function, we can directly set a minimum and maximum size and setting it fluid in between. This method is a good approach, and we could even set different type sizes taking the same value as base and multiplying this value by your favourite typographic ratio—like for example the Golden Ratio (1.618).\n\nHowever this method has the drawback that for small screens we generally want to set smaller jumps between our different typesizes, so ideally we would set a different typographic ratio. In order to do that we would have to create a breakpoint where all the types would change abruptly, making that part of the design a little bit junky. Also, it is not very obvious at between which viewport widths is the fluid part going to kick in.\n\nIn order to overcome this, Andy Bell points out in its phenomenal course Complete CSS a way to generate a typographic scale setting different ratios between screen sizes. So for example, we can create a scale for screens up until 400px that will have a 1.414 ratio, and then from screens from 400px to 1200px the ratio will increase the bigger the viewport, until a maximum of 1.618. In order to do that, we can use the values generated by Utopia website. As Utopia already generates the fluid values for each of our steps, we just have to generate then and paste them in our code.\n\nNow we are in control of everything, we can define the minimum and maximum sizes where our fluid typography will work, and we can also define a different scale for small viewports what will steadily grow—or shrink if that is desired—until reaching the scale we set for larger viewports. Also, it allows us to use rem instead of px, which should be considered a best practice for accesibility. This makes our typography fit and look harmonious in every screen size.\n\nHowever, there is a price we are paying, we're losing all control in our CSS, and each time we want to change our ratios, add and/or remove different steps or setting different screen limits, we will have to calculate back at Utopia's website and paste it in our code. Also, we lose the ability to try different values in our CSS and see them updated live in our browser.\n\nAs we introduced before, CSS Typed Arithmetic shipped in Chrome 140, allowing us “to write expressions in CSS such as calc(10em / 1px) or calc(20% / 0.5em * 1px)”. This small addition is crucial, as now we can change our unitless typographic ratio based on screen width. Taking as a base the slope formula that Utopia also uses, we will calculate a --screen-normalizer variable that will allow us to adjust both our font-size and our typographic-ratio to the viewport size withing our predefined bounds.\n\nThis opens a whole world of possibilities, as now we can easily switch between different type scales and sizes live from your console, which we find really handy for prototyping. Having all your spacing relative to just two measures makes it trivial to generate different additional type or space sizes when needed. In case I need a font size a half-step bigger or smaller than any of my current sizes, we just have to multiply or divide by the square root of my --fluid-step variable.\n\nAs of today, this is still just supported in Chrome, but we can start using it having Utopia generated classes as fallback using @supports rules.\n\nWhile already in the baseline support, CSS functions still don't support some mathematical functions as pow() or clamp(). When that time comes, it will be even easier to make font and space sizes on the fly, using just a function and a number that expresses the number of steps on your design system. For example, --fluid-size(2) could be used to get the size for the second step in the scale and work both for fonts and for spacing.\n\nMeanwhile, pressing the button below will open a menu that will let you play with all the typographic measures of this website, squizzing and expanding it as much as you like!",

    "title": "The Phone Ban Saved High School",
    "description": "Since the bell-to-bell device lockup, teens in New York have rediscovered the simple pleasures of conversation, board games, and poker.",
    "fullText": "When New York State banned phones in public schools from bell to bell this past September, the goal — according to the ban’s champion, Governor Hochul — was undistracted learning. But within weeks of the Great Phone Lockup, teachers began to notice an incidental (and arguably even more compelling) benefit: The teens were talking to one another as if they were in a Brat Pack movie. Sure, there’s been grumbling and some burner phones and scrolling in the bathroom. At one high school, an entrepreneurial senior even bought a pouch-unlocking magnet on Amazon and tried to charge classmates a dollar per jailbreak. But generally, with phones off-limits, the atmosphere feels different. There’s a pleasant buzz in the lunchroom, chatter in the hallways, and an alphabet of new analog hobbies popping up just about everywhere. “We’ve had a lot more school spirit,” says Rosalmi, a senior at New Heights Academy Charter School in Harlem. “People are more willing to do stuff.”\n\nWhat stuff are they doing? At many schools, teachers have made cards, board games, and sports equipment available during free time, and the kids have deigned to use them. Kevin Casado, a coach and teacher at Math, Engineering, and Science Academy Charter High School in Bushwick, hands out volleyballs every lunch period. He says a lot more kids are playing this year than were last year. “It’s no net, open space, forming their own circles of ten or 12 kids, hitting it up to each other, an equal number of girls and boys,” he adds. Aidan Amin, a ninth-grader at Hunter College High School, is in a friend group that congregates in the school foyer to stack OK Play tiles and compete at Sorry! and other tabletop games during lunch. “I’d say it’s made us closer. Honestly, half the people I’m playing board games with I didn’t know at all before this,” Aidan says.\n\nAt Rosalmi’s school, dominoes rule the cafeteria. “Dominoes is really a staple Dominican game. People get passionate. You have to slam that first piece down on the table!” she says, adding that there’s trash talk “but it’s game trash talk. It’s really funny.” About 11 miles south, at Brooklyn Technical High School, the name of the game is poker, the trash talk is (sometimes) in Russian, and instead of chips or cash, the kids bet with hair ties. Josh (not his real name), a junior there, says about half a dozen games go on during free periods. He tends to play Texas Hold’em with a group of friends he made this year. Their antics draw spectators and even side wagers: “We have one player who is probably the least skilled, but a lot of people bet on him because he has absurd luck,” he says. “He pulled our group’s first-of-the-year full house with pocket aces. He’s very entertaining.”\n\nOther students have discovered vintage technology like Game Boys and mp3 players. Alexei Kotov is a sophomore at Aviation High School in Queens. He bought a CD Walkman on Amazon last year, and since the phone ban started, he has been packing his dad’s old CDs — the Doors, Weezer — in his backpack. “My favorite one’s probably No Doubt’s Tragic Kingdom,” Alexei says. “I like the vocals. It’s, like, really emotional.” He shares his earbuds at lunch and swaps recommendations with friends. “One of them is really into Queen,” he says.\n\nNoshin Sayira is a junior at Stuyvesant High School, meaning she’s in the middle of the highest-pressure year at what may be one of the highest-pressure high schools in the country. She tells me that students’ top objection to the phone policy is that it’s become cumbersome to do homework between classes or to quickly study in the hallway before a test. But Noshin recently started printing out her study guides and has found that reviewing on paper actually works better: “I don’t get distracted by notifications,” she says. She and her friends have developed a stress-relieving free-period ritual: They sketch one another’s outfits. “One of my friends usually has supplies like colored pencils and proper paper,” she says.\n\nTokyo Levy, a seventh-grader at I.S. 318 in Williamsburg, is a discernibly different kid than he was in his phone-carrying days, at least according to his mother, Krystyna Printup, an art teacher at the Brooklyn School for Social Justice in Bushwick. “He was forced into the rapid learning and usage of technology during COVID when he had to attend school from home via Zoom,” she says. That led to a fixation on video and computer games — Minecraft, Clash Royale — then social media. “Now, his phone is no longer clutched by his side to run to after dinner or before bed. There have even been a couple days where he’s left his phone accidentally at home.” At school, after noticing kids gathered around chess boards during lunch, he decided to “I’ve always thought of people who played chess as really intelligent people. I see other people play, and it has really motivated me to try it out for myself,” he says. Participating in soccer in the schoolyard at recess inspired him to join a soccer league in his neighborhood, too.\n\nLately, he’s been bugging his parents not for a new video game or an upgraded phone but for a mainstay of their own childhoods: a bicycle. He wants to hang out with the new friends he’s made at school on the weekends.",

    "fullText": "Zooey Deschanel, 45, says she's mindful of how she shows up around her kids.\n\nOn Thursday's episode of \"Call Her Daddy,\" the \"Elf\" actor spoke about being bullied as a child and how it shaped her identity and her approach to parenting.\n\nThough she still has moments of insecurity, Deschanel says she doesn't let her kids see them.\n\n\"I have a daughter and a son, and I don't want them to ever think like, 'Oh, Mommy's insecure,' or, you know, like, 'My mom doesn't like…'\" Deschanel told host Alex Cooper.\n\n\"I always want them to think I'm happy with myself and, like, because they get their self-esteem from their parents, you know. So yeah, it's important to me to, like, show up with confidence,\" she said.\n\nDeschanel shares two children with her ex-husband, Jacob Pechenik. The pair split in 2019 after four years of marriage.\n\nThe actor said she's aware that Hollywood can be brutal to women when it comes to their appearance, but says she tries not to let that kind of commentary affect her.\n\nWhat's important is having a strong sense of self, she said.\n\n\"My identity was never super wrapped up in my appearance. I always made an effort to be like, what I'm presenting is more about my style and like, artistic and creative expressions versus, 'Oh, like I'm so just naturally perfect,'\" Deschanel said.\n\n\"All those things are so ephemeral and, you know, they change, and they're subjective. And so I think not having my identity so wrapped up in what I looked like when I was 25 is really great,\" she said.\n\nDeschanel says she tries to be fully present with her kids whenever she isn't working, including doing school drop-offs and pickups, taking them to playdates, and attending their extracurricular activities.\n\nWhen she is working, she focuses on attending the important events.\n\n\"I get that sometimes you can't, but try to get there for like, whatever, the big game or the school play or like those big things, because those are the things they remember a lot,\" Deschanel said.\n\nDeschanel joins other celebrities talking about how they try to instill confidence in their kids.\n\nSpeaking to People in 2024, Carson Daly said he's honest about his own struggles with his kids and treats them like adults so they feel safe discussing difficult topics with him.\n\n\"I've always talked to them like they were 30 years old,\" Daly said.\n\nIn May, Kate Winslet's daughter, Mia Threapleton, told Elle that her mother tried to instill body confidence in her from a young age, including when she was insecure about showing her shoulders while swimming.\n\n\"My mom said: 'No, this is strong. So many people would love to be able to swim the length of the pool the way you do — think of it as a positive thing,'\" Threapleton said, recalling her mother's words.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, a move that is sure to infuriate China.\n\nThe State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump’s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China’s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.\n\nThe eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nOther sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.\n\nIn separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”\n\n“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.\n\nUnder federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain “sufficient self-defense capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.\n\nThe arms sales comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.\n\nTaiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.\n\nThe U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.\n\nLast week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor.\n\n“The bill has kept playing up the ‘China threat’ narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China’s sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,” Beijing’s embassy in Washington said after the legislation passed the House.\n\n“China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,” it said.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing. AP video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend and longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell asked a federal judge on Wednesday to set aside her sex trafficking conviction and free her from a 20-year prison sentence, saying “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial.\n\nMaxwell maintained in a habeas petition she has promised to file since August that information that would have resulted in her exoneration at her 2021 trial was withheld and false testimony was presented to the jury.\n\nShe said the cumulative effect of the constitutional violations resulted in a “complete miscarriage of justice.”\n\nA habeas petition (or writ of habeas corpus petition) is a legal request for a court to review the legality of someone’s detention, demanding that the custodian (like a prison official) bring the prisoner before a judge to justify the imprisonment, serving as a fundamental safeguard against unlawful confinement and arbitrary detention by ensuring due process. Filed by or on behalf of someone in custody, it challenges constitutional violations, such as ineffective legal counsel or unfair trials, and seeks release or other relief, often as a last resort after appeals are exhausted.\n\n“Since the conclusion of her trial, substantial new evidence has emerged from related civil actions, Government disclosures, investigative reports, and documents demonstrating constitutional violations that undermined the fairness of her proceeding,” the filing in Manhattan federal court said. “In the light of the full evidentiary record, no reasonable juror would have convicted her.”\n\nThe filing came just two days before records in her case were scheduled to be released publicly as a result of President Donald Trump's signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The law, signed after months of public and political pressure, requires the Justice Department to provide the public with Epstein-related records by Dec. 19.\n\nForced to act by the new transparency law, the Justice Department has said it plans to release 18 categories of investigative materials gathered in the massive sex trafficking probe, including search warrants, financial records, notes from interviews with victims, and data from electronic devices.\n\nEpstein, a millionaire financier, was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges. A month later, he was found dead in his cell at a New York federal jail and the death was ruled a suicide. Maxwell, a British socialite, was arrested a year later and was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021. She was interviewed by the Justice Department’s second-in-command in July and was soon afterward moved from a federal prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas.\n\nAfter the Justice Department asked a New York federal judge to permit grand jury and discovery materials gathered prior to her trial to be released publicly, attorney David Markus wrote on her behalf that while Maxwell now “does not take a position” on unsealing documents from her case, doing so “would create undue prejudice so severe that it would foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial” if her habeas petition succeeds.\n\nThe records, Markus said, “contain untested and unproven allegations.”\n\nLast week, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan granted the Justice Department's request to publicly release the materials.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said during a news conference on another topic that he would follow the law and the judge's orders pertaining to the records.\n\nEngelmayer, who along with other judges had previously rejected Justice Department unsealing requests before the transparency law was passed, said the materials “do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.”",

    "title": "Austria Buys M-346F Light Fighters",
    "description": "The M-346Fs will give Austria a new air combat boost, supplementing the country's long-troubled Eurofighter Typhoon fleet.",
    "fullText": "Austria is buying 12 M-346F Block 20 light combat aircraft from Italian defense contractor Leonardo, as part of an overhaul of its air force, the Luftstreitkräfte. Austria does already operate 15 Eurofighter Typhoons, which were procured under controversial circumstances. Those jets have notably limited capabilities compared to other Typhoons, as well as high operating costs, which have prompted attempts to offload them.\n\nLeonardo announced the Austrian contract today. As well as the dozen M-346s, the deal includes simulation systems for pilots, training for maintenance technicians, spare parts and equipment, plus logistical support for six years. The total cost is around $1.7 billion, and the first aircraft is due to be delivered in 2028.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, the Austrian Air Force will use the M-346Fs for the “defense needs of Austria’s national airspace and territory,” as well as for training.\n\nThe two-seat M-346 was originally developed as an advanced jet trainer, but light combat versions have long been offered for sale. Block 20 standard variants are notably well-equipped for aircraft of their size and weight. They come with a pair of large-area displays (LAD) in each cockpit, an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, a Link 16 datalink, and electronic countermeasures. The jets are capable of being configured to employ various air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons options, but can also be operated as pure trainers.\n\nIn the trainer role, the M-346Fs will serve as a successor to the Austrian Air Force’s Saab 105 jets, which were retired in 2020, and are seen in the video below.\n\nThe M-346 has been developed by Leonardo as part of an integrated advanced flight training system. Beyond the jets themselves, this includes a ground-based training system (GBTS), which is based around the live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) concept. In this way, simulated elements and scenarios can be combined with real-life training flights.\n\nAustria is already familiar with the M-346 as its pilots already train on it at the International Flight Training School (IFTS), which Leonardo and the Italian Air Force operate together in Decimomannu, Italy.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, the complete training system for Austria will include capabilities related to air-to-surface missions. This would be a new development for the Austrian Air Force, which is currently optimized for air defense.\n\nIt will also allow pilots to train for aerial refueling, something else that hasn’t previously been featured in the Alpine air arm’s operations. It is worth noting here that the Luftstreitkräfte does not currently operate any tankers itself.\n\nMost notably, however, as well as advanced training, Austria will fly the M-346 in the “dual role of fighter for lower-intensity operations,” according to Leonardo.\n\nWhile the now-retired Saab 105s had a limited air-policing role, the M-346F’s capabilities mean that certain, more expansive operational missions could be ‘downloaded’ from the expensive Typhoon and onto the smaller and more economical jet.\n\nNonetheless, this would still be a significant augmentation for the Typhoon force, not least because Austria is a small country and the M-346F would be capable of responding to most routine threats, especially thanks to its AESA radar.\n\nFurthermore, the Austrian Typhoons have no beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile armament, so the M-346Fs wouldn’t be at a disadvantage in terms of weaponry, either.\n\nIn fact, an argument could be made for Austria having ordered the M-346F, or a similar light combat aircraft, rather than the Typhoon in the first place.\n\nThe Typhoon acquisition was far from straightforward. Austria selected the Eurofighter design over the Saab JAS 39C/D Gripen in 2002, but only finished paying off the €2 billion ($2.3 billion at the rate of conversion at the time of writing) purchase costs for the 15 single-seat jets (an order that was also reduced from a planned 18 aircraft) in 2014. The deal was also overshadowed by accusations of deception, fraud, and bribery, including a high-level lawsuit filed by the defense ministry against Airbus and Eurofighter.\n\nOverall, the Austrian Ministry of Defense has been far from happy with the Typhoon. It has called into question the jet’s operating costs and lack of certain critical capabilities — including the PIRATE infrared sensor, a helmet-mounted display, and the EuroDASS self-defense suite. As mentioned above, the Austrian jets have no beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and lack any air-to-ground capability.\n\nAs long ago as 2017, Austria outlined plans to phase out the Typhoons by 2023, arguing that it would be cheaper than upgrading them. Since these are the baseline Tranche 1 jets, equipped to the most basic standard, it is far harder to modernize them. At this time, it was envisaged that they would be replaced by 18 new fighters, which would also supersede the Saab 105s.\n\nMore recently, efforts were made to try to sell the Typhoons to Indonesia, as you can read about here.\n\nSomewhat ironically, back in 2020, Austria’s Green Party called for the replacement of both the Typhoon and the Saab 105 with the M-346.\n\nAs TWZ noted at the time, “Austrian Typhoon pilots already train on the M-346 in Italy, and in many ways it would seem to make an ideal replacement for the two-seat Saab. However, it lacks the raw performance and sophisticated avionics of a modern fighter jet, which would render it less suitable for the air policing role now undertaken by the Typhoon.”\n\nHowever, the M-346F Block 20 is a much more capable proposition in terms of avionics, although it remains subsonic.\n\nAs a non-aligned nation, Austria can’t rely on NATO support to defend its airspace, so having additional, more economical light combat aircraft to help do this job will be welcome.\n\nThe M-346 also has the benefit of an established user base and supply chains to go along with it. As a trainer, existing M-346 customers include Greece, Italy, Israel, Poland, Qatar, and Singapore. The Italian Air Force has also selected it as the future aircraft for its aerobatic team, the Frecce Tricolori.\n\nLeonardo, as part of a team-up with Textron in the United States, has also been offering a navalized M-346N version to the U.S. Navy as a possible replacement for that service’s T-45 Goshawk jet trainers. You can read more about the M-346N, which was rebranded as a Beechcraft product earlier this year, here. Beechcraft is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Textron.\n\nThe only country known to have already introduced a light combat aircraft version of the M-346 is Turkmenistan, which reportedly acquired just four M-346FA (Fighter Attack) versions, as well as two trainers. It’s unclear exactly what kinds of weapons the country’s jets carry.\n\nHowever, Nigeria now looks to be lining up to buy the M-346FA, as well, with a potential deal for as many as 24 of the jets reportedly on the cards.\n\nBuying the M-346 also further cements the Austrian Ministry of Defense’s own relationship with Leonardo, from which it previously acquired 36 AW169M Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) under two contracts signed in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe Austrian order and the possibility of a larger sale to Nigeria are good news for Leonardo, which is continuing to evolve the M-346 from an advanced jet trainer into an ever more versatile multirole light combat aircraft.\n\nThe overall market space for light fighters based on advanced jet trainers is steadily growing globally, too. Korea Aerospace Industries has seen particular success with its FA-50 version of its T-50 trainer. The possibility of Boeing developing a light fighter based on its T-7 Redhawk for the U.S. Air Force has also come up in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, the Austrian Air Force remains stuck with the Typhoon, something of a costly white elephant when it’s considered that its primary mission is peacetime air policing over neutral airspace. Ultimately, perhaps, the Typhoon might be retired without a direct replacement, leaving the future M-346Fs to take on all frontline fighter roles.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "Tucker Carlson claimed in a Wednesday interview that a member of Congress told him lawmakers were briefed that President Donald Trump is announcing “war is coming” tonight.\n\nCarlson joined Andrew Napolitano on his Judging Freedom podcast on Wednesday where they discussed growing tensions with Venezuela over strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as Trump’s address to the nation, scheduled for tonight.\n\n“Is Trump going to start a war in Venezuela?” Napolitano asked Carlson.\n\nAccording to Carlson, members of Congress were briefed on Trump’s plans, though he added he does not know the actual contents of Trump’s address.\n\n“Here’s what I know so far, which is that members of Congress were briefed yesterday that a war is coming and it’ll be announced in the address to the nation tonight at nine o’clock by the president,” Carlson said. “Who knows, by the way, if that’ll actually happen.”\n\nThe former Fox News host claimed he was told about the briefing by a member of Congress that morning.\n\nNotably, Axios’s Marc Caputo, who is well-sourced inside the Trump White House, reacted to Carlson’s comments, saying, “My sources say this wasn’t briefed & this announcement isn’t happening at 9.”\n\nCarlson is opposed to military action in Venezuela, arguing it would be repeating foreign policy mistakes of the past.\n\n“There’s not been a regime change effort that’s benefitted the United States or the world in 80 years that I’m aware of,” he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of being at the head of a narco terrorist smuggling operation. Maduro’s election victory has long been contested, with U.S. and global officials casting doubt on the results.\n\n“The illegitimate Maduro Regime is using Oil from these stolen Oil Fields to finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping. For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,” Trump announced this week.\n\nThe president has also set his sights on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, responding to his criticism of recent boat strikes by warning him he could have “big problems” soon.\n\n“He’s gonna have himself some big problems if he doesn’t wise up,” Trump told reporters. “Did he say Colombia’s producing a lot of drugs? They have cocaine factories that they make cocaine, as you know, and they sell it right into the United States. So he better wise up or he’ll be next.”\n\nThe post ‘War is Coming’: Tucker Carlson Says a Member of Congress Told Him What Trump Is Announcing Tonight first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Idaho’s Affordable Care Act marketplace closed open enrollment Monday. What the data show about who signed up for insurance — and who didn’t.",
    "fullText": "If federal subsidies for marketplace health insurance plans expire at the end of the year, Idahoans on the most “vulnerable fringes” will feel the effects first, Rep. Ilana Rubel, a Boise Democrat, said Tuesday.\n\nBut it won’t be long until the loss of those subsidies, which keep insurance premiums low for people on Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance plans, “hits every single person in the state,” she said at a protest organized by Ada County Democrats.\n\nWithout the subsidies, monthly premiums are expected to more than double for many plans, the Kaiser Family Foundation found. If marketplace premiums dramatically increase without federal subsidies, more people will likely choose to go uninsured — a serious problem for hospitals, which rely on people with private insurance plans to pay the bills, Rubel said.\n\n“When you pull out people’s private insurance, you make it impossible for hospitals and providers to operate profitably,” Rubel said. “You can be the richest person in the state with fabulous insurance, but if a hospital in your area has gone out of business, and you have a heart attack, you are out of luck.”\n\nIdaho’s open enrollment period closed Monday — the first marketplace in the country to do so. At Tuesday’s protest, held outside the Boise office of U.S. Sen. Jim Risch in protest of Congressional Republicans’ “inaction” on reinstating the subsidies, Ada County Democrats Chair Jared DeLoof said Idaho would be “ground zero for a national health care affordability crisis.”\n\nMadison Hardy, a spokesperson for Risch, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“People do die from a lack of health care. People do die from a lack of health insurance,” Rubel said. “Unfortunately, we are going to be Exhibit A for that shortly.”\n\nHer predictions were echoed by leaders of Your Health Idaho, the state’s official health insurance marketplace. Of the 115,000 Idaho residents who rely on marketplace plans, the marketplace expects 25,000 to cancel their coverage as plans become more expensive, said Nichol Lapierre, its chief marketing officer.\n\nBut initial data from Your Health Idaho painted a more murky picture of residents’ decisions. Twice as many Idaho residents canceled their existing marketplace coverage as during open enrollment last year, Lapierre said — but there were also more people who enrolled in new plans, leading to a 4% increase in the number of people enrolled overall.\n\nThough Your Health Idaho is “encouraged” by the overall increase in enrollment, Executive Director Pat Kelly said, he highlighted a nearly 10% shift from “gold” and “silver” plans that cover almost all health care costs to “bronze” plans that have lower premiums but much higher deductibles and other costs.\n\nAround 5,000 customers have canceled plans for the upcoming year because of concerns about affordability, according to Your Health Idaho, and the marketplace anticipates more cancellations in the coming months. If premiums spike in early 2026, Your Health Idaho expects another 20,000 Idaho residents to cancel their coverage or be terminated by their insurance carriers for nonpayment.\n\n“The final enrollment numbers won’t settle until April,” Lapierre said.\n\nDeLoof emphasized that these marketplace plans are not “handouts,” but rather the plans used by small business owners, self-employed workers and farmers.\n\nThough those people make too much to qualify for Medicaid, they “cannot absorb the massive premium hikes that are coming their way,” he said Tuesday. “Working families are being squeezed from every direction.”\n\nBecca Savransky contributed reporting.\n\n‘People are going to die’: Idahoans fear spike in insurance costs\n\nMore Idaho children are losing health insurance. Here’s what we know",

    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua doubled down on his controversial \"kill\" comments to Jake Paul after being challenged on the comments at a news conference in Miami on Wednesday.\n\nThe remarks were first made on Tuesday when Joshua was asked whether he would hold back against Paul, with Joshua saying \"if I can kill you, I'll kill\".\n\nSaturday's fight against YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul has attracted criticism over safety concerns and the size difference between the fighters.\n\nAnd former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury called Joshua a \"classless loser\" for the \"kill\" comments.\n\nBut Joshua, 36, said: \"It's my job, we fight. We have a licence to kill.\n\n\"I'm sure many people don't understand it but this is what my job is. I just enjoy what I do.\n\n\"Whatever happens, happens - as long as my hand is raised, that's what's important, respectfully.\n\n\"That's just what the mentality we have to have as fighters. I don't know if other fighters think that way. Maybe they're a bit more tame.\n\n\"The way my mind works. When you're in the ring, it's a dangerous thing. Anything can happen.\n\n\"You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing you just did your job. It wasn't personal.\"\n\nPaul, who is a huge underdog in the heavyweight contest as a natural cruiserweight, was no less incendiary in response.\n\n\"This is a modern day gladiator sport,\" Paul said.\n\n\"I'm ready. I want his hardest punches. I want there to be no excuses when it's all said and done. Let's kill each other.\"",

I can’t figure out how to end world hunger.” But he quickly pivoted to something he believes he can do something about: the American healthcare system.\n\n“I do promise that I will continue to change healthcare in this country and make it more affordable, possibly setting a path towards Universal Healthcare,” Cuban said.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nHe's already been making moves. Through his company, Cost Plus Drugs, Cuban is working to bring down drug prices by eliminating the middlemen who inflate costs. The company adds just a 15% markup on medications and publishes its entire price list online. It now offers over 6,000 medications.\n\nCuban has been especially critical of pharmacy benefit managers, who he believes were supposed to lower costs but have instead become profit-driven giants. According to him, they acquired insurance providers and retail pharmacies and are now attempting to expand into pharmaceutical manufacturing. “They got greedy,” Cuban told Fortune earlier this year.\n\nAlthough Cuban believes “healthcare is a right,” he argues that moving the U.S. to a universal healthcare system isn't the quick fix people assume it is. In a September post on X, he said, “The easy answer is to say Universal Healthcare. The challenge is that every single country that has UHC, moved to it before medical science introduced advanced expensive equipment.”\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nHe added that the hard part is delivering care fairly without financially devastating doctors and hospitals. “The only challenge is how we design the system that works in this country,” he wrote.\n\nCuban has floated an alternative idea: keep insurers from being the central force, eliminate premiums, and expand cash-pay options with clear pricing. That way, patients would commit to what they can afford, with taxpayers covering the rest.",

    "fullText": "Honda, a generally reliable automaker, has initiated several significant recalls in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nFor at least the third time over this past month and a half, the Japanese auto giant is issuing a massive recall for a hazardous issue.\n\nThe first recall,  announced on Oct. 31 through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), involves Honda Civic models spanning six model years. Honda Civics from model years 2016 to 2021 with 18-inch alloy wheels are affected.\n\nThe company warned that loose or missing lug seat inserts could cause the wheel nuts to loosen over time, potentially leading to wheel separation during use.\n\nAccording to the safety recall report, the defect originated when a factory worker at the wheel supplier’s facility in Italy moved a safety fence that separated finished wheels from unfinished ones.\n\nIn November, Honda announced a recall of more than 250,000 Accord Hybrids due to a potentially dangerous software flaw that could cause the CPU to reset while driving, resulting in the car losing drive power, according to an NHTSA alert.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Highway Traffic Administration announced that Honda is recalling 70,658 vehicles in the U.S. due to reduced brake function that can extend the distance required to stop, increasing the risk of a crash or injury.\n\nHonda told regulators that the issue was identified through internal investigations and customer feedback. While it says it has not reported any fatalities related to the problem, it did acknowledge that the compromised braking poses a safety concern.\n\nHonda dealers will inspect the impacted vehicles at no cost to customers.\n\nThe recall affects Acura ILX vehicles manufactured from 2014 to 2020 due to a residual plasticizer in the brake reservoir hose, which causes the master cylinder seal to swell.\n\nThe defect can reduce brake-pedal firmness and increase stopping distances.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Administration has recorded a disturbing trend over the past five years. Millions of Americans are driving around in vehicles that have been recalled but were never fixed, according to NHTSA data.\n\nWhile the number of vehicles recalled is trending lower, the number of recalls issued has remained elevated above pre-Covid levels.\n\nThere were fewer than 30 million recalls in 2024, marking the third time this has happened in the last 10 years, yet more than 1,000 recalls were issued for the fourth consecutive year.",

There really can't be many believers left. As Nancy spoke, it was hard to avoid wincing and wincing and wincing again.\n\nAs he made his way through his post-match assessment, the temptation was to shout, 'Stop... stop talking... stop explaining because when you're explaining, you're losing, again'.\n\nThe bottom line in all of this is that between his nightmarish beginning with Celtic and his low-key ending with Columbus Crew, Nancy has won just three of his past 16 games as a manager.\n\nThe defeats by United, St Mirren, Roma and Hearts now joined the ones that went before in America - Cincinnati (twice), Chicago Fire, New York City and New England Revolution.\n\nNancy finished seventh in the regular season in MLS, won 14 of 34 games, ranking joint sixth in the league for goals scored and eighth for goals conceded. After being manager of the season the year before, it was all very blah.\n\nHis credentials for the Celtic job were, at best, thin, despite the excited rhetoric of some observers in America, who painted him as a special one and his capture as a coup.",

    "description": "Reuters reports that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering AI.",
    "fullText": "A report from Reuters claims that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering artificial intelligence. Sources told the publication that a team in Shenzhen completed the prototype of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine earlier this year and it is allegedly now undergoing testing. The EUV machine was reportedly made by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML. Reuters states that China is targeting production of its own EUV chips beginning in 2028, although other experts have projected 2030 as a more likely date.\n\nEUV is a supremely complicated bit of technology; we have an explainer below that gets into some of the details. It is at the heart of the chips made by companies such as Intel and TSMC, so any company trying to compete would also need access to EUV. Although the Chinese prototype is not yet making chips, it is reportedly able to generate the extreme ultraviolet light needed for chip manufacturing.\n\nIf confirmed, this development would put China in control of tech much sooner than analysts had previously expected. To date, EUV has largely been kept out of reach by Western companies and used as a bargaining chip by the US government. Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed a high priority on the country being able to produce its own semiconductors. \"The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,\" a source told Reuters. \"China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.\"",

    "fullText": "Many electric vehicle drivers have experienced disturbing incidents at charging stations when others maliciously unplug the cables or even cut the cords. Surveillance footage and personal confrontations often reveal that vandals disrupt EV charging out of spite or hatred towards people who own and drive clean-energy vehicles.\n\nHowever, even business owners and store managers sometimes unplug EVs on their property, much to the dismay of drivers who rely on public charging stations.\n\nIn a Reddit post to r/TeslaModelY, one driver shared details about a frustrating encounter while charging at a local grocery store.\n\nThe OP explained they began charging their EV at a grocery store and went into the store's Starbucks to work while it was charging. The store manager told the OP that he unplugged the car because those stations are only for customers.\n\nHowever, the OP was actually a customer who bought a drink and was working inside the store's coffee shop. The encounter made the OP feel \"extremely uncomfortable,\" so they packed up their belongings and left.\n\n\"I'm bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at, and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping, but I don't want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will, without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging,\" the OP shared.\n\nThis situation is unfortunate because it prevented an EV driver from charging their EV. It also created anxiety for the OP by eliminating a reliable charging source while out running errands.\n\nUnfortunately, EV driver harassment is a widespread problem worldwide. Not only do unplugging vehicles and other threatening behaviors create unnecessary tension between EV and non-EV owners, but they also slow the broader adoption of clean-energy driving.\n\nThose who have yet to learn about the impressive technological advancements and benefits of EVs may rely on outdated information or anti-EV propaganda to justify their actions.\n\nIt's true that EV production does use some natural resources and generates some pollution. However, EVs are still far cleaner and more sustainable than gas-powered vehicles, which release tailpipe fumes wherever they go.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhen you embrace highly efficient electric vehicle driving, you help sustain breathable air and contribute less to overheating the planet. You can also save significantly on vehicle ownership costs by avoiding the need to buy gas and the routine maintenance costs of traditional cars.\n\nIn response to the OP's post, Reddit users offered their advice about how to handle the situation.\n\n\"You should definitely use one of those charging locks next time you go,\" one Redditor recommended.\n\n\"I would complain to corporate or his boss,\" someone else suggested.\n\n\"Report them for tampering with a customer's car,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices likely increased by the most in 1-1/2 years in the year to November, economists predicted, which would underscore the worsening affordability challenges confronting Americans that have been partly blamed on tariffs on imports.\n\nThe Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will not publish month-to-month changes when ​it releases the delayed Consumer Price Index report for November on Tuesday after the 43-day shutdown of the government prevented the collection of October data. The October CPI release ‌was canceled because the price data could not be collected retroactively.\n\nThe longest shutdown in history also impacted labor market data, with the government failing to publish an unemployment rate for October for the first time ever.\n\nBut the BLS will publish ‌the year-on-year rates for the CPI and the so-called core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy components.\n\nThe agency publishes numerous indexes in addition to the broad CPI and core CPI. Those derived from data that does not need to be physically collected will be available, though the BLS said it expected \"the number of publishable indexes to be small.\"\n\nThe statistics agency has said it \"cannot provide specific guidance to data users for navigating the missing October observations.\" Economists advised viewing the CPI and its components on a year-on-year basis or two-month change.\n\n\"Downward inflation progress has stalled,\" said Andy Schneider, a senior U.S. economist ⁠at BNP Paribas. \"This largely reflects companies in goods-producing sectors passing tariff ‌costs through into prices.\"\n\nThe CPI likely increased 3.1% year-on-year in November, which would be the largest gain since May 2024, a Reuters survey of economists estimated. The CPI advanced 3.0% in the 12 months through September.\n\nBut the CPI could print below expectations as data collection was delayed late into the month, ‍when retailers offered holiday season discounts. That could be evident in lower prices for goods like furniture and recreation goods.\n\n\"November CPI this year could capture a period that more heavily reflects holiday season discounts than a usual November, which would reflect average prices through the whole month,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. \"If there is some abnormal weakness in November goods prices, there could be a larger rebound in these components in ​December.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's sweeping import duties have raised prices for many goods, though the tariff pass-through has been gradual as businesses worked through inventory accumulated prior to the tightening of trade ‌policy and also absorbed some of the taxes, evident in moderate new motor vehicle price increases.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.\n\nArnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.\n\n“Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation — intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,” said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP’s chief correspondent at the United Nations.\n\nAs a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.\n\nWhile almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.\n\n\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.\n\n\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. “They are hitting the center of the city.”\n\nIt was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.\n\nIn January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.\n\n\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,” Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. “He sank to the ground at my feet.”\n\nHe would begin the fallen soldier’s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"\n\nArnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia’s economy was in shambles and the country’s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.\n\nAt the AP’s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nHe credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.\n\nArnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP’s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau’s papers as coverage of the war wound down.\n\nInstead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they’d have historic value someday. They’re now in the AP’s archives.\n\nArnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.\n\nTen years later he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.\n\nIn 1995 he published the memoir, “Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.”\n\nArnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.\n\nHe was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military’s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.\n\nAfter his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.\n\nIn 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China’s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.\n\nBorn Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.\n\n\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a — you know — enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.\n\nAfter a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.\n\nSoon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.\n\nArnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.\n\n\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.”\n\nAP journalist Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "The Patriots suffered a defeat against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, but their chances of securing the AFC East title remain promising.\n\nNew England still has three regular season games remaining, playing the Baltimore Ravens, New York Jets and Miami Dolphins.\n\nBrad Gagnon from Bleacher Report outlined the Patriots’ ideal scenario for the remainder of the regular season.\n\n“Beat the Ravens on the road in Week 16 to show some much-needed resiliency, then clinch the AFC East title by taking care of the division-rival Jets and/or Dolphins to close out the regular season,” Gagnon wrote on Wednesday.\n\nThe Patriots can secure a playoff spot with a win or a tie against the Ravens this Sunday. However, New England will need to wait for the outcome of the last two weeks, which will be determined by division opponents, to see if it can clinch the AFC East title.\n\nNew England currently has an 11-3 record, while Buffalo is at 10-4. If the Patriots win their remaining games, they will secure the AFC East title. However, after losing to Buffalo in Week 15, they lost the head-to-head tiebreaker, as the Patriots and Bills split their matchups this season.\n\nThe next tiebreaker is based on wins against division opponents. The Patriots have a 3-1 record, while the Bills are 3-2 following their loss to the Dolphins.\n\nEven if the Patriots lose to the Ravens but defeat the Jets and Dolphins, New England will still claim the AFC East title, even if the Bills win all their remaining games.\n\nPatriots-Ravens Injury Report: Lamar Jackson Among Starters Missing On Both Sides",

    "fullText": "The Boston Bruins added some more depth to their defensive unit on Tuesday.\n\nBoston claimed 24-year-old defenseman Vladislav Kolyachonok off waivers from the Dallas Stars. Kolyachonok had his first practice with the Bruins on Wednesday, and head coach Marco Sturm said the team added him as more depth.\n\n“That’s why we kind of picked him up,” Sturm said on Wednesday. “We needed some extra help, we are running really thin right now, and didn’t want to get in trouble, getting one injury away.\n\n“We felt like he will be a good addition to our D-group. (General manager Don Sweeney) and his staff were scouting him for the last little bit. Seems like a good kid.”\n\nKolyachonok has one goal and two assists in 11 games with the Stars. The left-shot defenseman will add depth to Boston’s blue line, but Sturm isn’t sure when he will make his Bruins’ debut.\n\n“He has a little bit of everything, I feel like he has a little bit of offense, he can defend,” Sturm said. “I think he played some PK as well. We look at him as a depth guy, and hopefully he is going to get a chance, too, I don’t know when.”\n\nKolyachonok, meanwhile, is just excited to be with Boston and will play whatever role is asked of him.\n\n“Whatever they tell me to do, I am going to do it,” Kolyachonok said.\n\nThe Bruins will return to the ice on Thursday at home against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nCharlie McAvoy Shouts Out Unsung Hero From Bruins’ Win Vs.

    "fullText": "Andriy Lunin emerged as one of Real Madrid’s decisive figures in the 3–2 win over Talavera, not only for his late heroics between the posts but also for his words afterward in the mixed zone. Wearing the captain’s armband on the night, the Ukrainian goalkeeper addressed the media.\n\n“Thanks to the half of the squad that wasn’t here, to all the captains — being captain of Real Madrid is always an honor. There’s a lot of hard work and time behind it, and I’m grateful to everyone who has helped me all this time.”\n\n“It was difficult to advance, it’s always difficult. The Cup is different, the matches are different and I would like to advance without conceding any goals, but we are already in the round of 16 and we have to keep fighting for the Cup.”\n\n“You have to understand that every coach is different. Ancelotti was older, more experienced, and had won everything in his career. Xabi is young, everyone respects him, there are new things going on, and it’s a normal process of adaptation and change.”\n\n“I don’t know who could doubt Xabi, we don’t doubt our coach. We’re a group and we’re all in the same boat. I don’t know who’s questioning him, whether it’s the fans or the press, but in the end it doesn’t matter to us because we’re focused on our job.”\n\n“We prepare for every match the same way. We are all aware here of what club we are at and what is at stake. We must win every match.\n\n“We had to be even more aggressive, focused, and not relax. We advanced, and that’s the most important thing.”\n\n“I don’t think that way. It’s my job, what I’ve been doing since I was little. I have to help the team and always be ready.”\n\n“We had to play a serious match and we did so to a certain point. The important thing was to get through the round and keep fighting.”",

    "description": "Follow the latest injury news for fantasy football lineups in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "Staying up to date on NFL injury news is of the utmost importance for fantasy football success. The article below tracks all fantasy-relevant players currently listed on their team's injury report, and provides fantasy managers with actionable recommendations as new information rolls in.\n\nCheck back for updates from Tuesday through Saturday.\n\n**UPDATED AS OF WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 17TH AT 7:25 PM ET**\n\nKincaid practiced fully through the knee injury last week. He was held out on Wednesday, to begin Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: It is possible he suffered a setback. Thursday and Friday's injury reports are worth following.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Bills signed kicker Michael Badgley to kick in Prater's stead. He is barely on the K1 radar.\n\nHill suffered a dislocated knee in the team's Week 4 win over the Jets. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Hill's absence likely places additional emphasis on the short-to-intermediate areas of the field, increasing the expected target volume for De'Von Achane, Darren Waller, and Jaylen Waddle.\n\nJennings will miss the rest of the regular season on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jennings is no longer a threat to steal short-yardage carries.\n\nHall is practicing fully for Week 16 against the Saints.\n\nFantasy Impact: He remains an RB2.\n\nTaylor has been ruled out for Week 16, missing his second consecutive game.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell should operate as the clear-cut No. 1 pass catcher.\n\nTaylor departed the team's Week 14 loss to the Dolphins with a groin injury and did not return. Taylor was sidelined on Wednesday and did not play in Week 15. He is competing with quarterback Justin Fields (knee) for the primary backup role.\n\nFields is rehabbing the knee injury while competing for the No. 2 job.\n\nWilson sprained his knee in his return to the active roster in Week 10 and is set to miss \"three-to-four weeks.\" He was placed on injured reserve and is eligible to return in Week 15. Head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters Monday that he did not have an update on Wilson's potential return from injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Whelp, Wilson's return didn't last long as he is now set to miss another chunk of time with an additional knee injury. The Jets again find themselves bereft of pass-catching talent. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor stands to benefit the most in a fantasy setting, although the Jets continue to be allergic to throwing the football. Head coach Aaron Glenn said last week that he expects Wilson to \"return this season.\"\n\nAllen suffered a \"pretty serious\" knee injury on a kickoff return in the second quarter of the team's Week 4 loss to the Dolphins. He is out indefinitely.\n\nFantasy Impact: Allen has been a significant contributor in the red zone this season. His absence substantially boosts Breece Hall's upside, who is now a locked-in RB1 in Week 5 against the Cowboys. Backup running back Isaiah Davis can be stashed in 12-team leagues as a high-upside contingency option. Hall gained a season-high 155 yards from scrimmage on 18 opportunities in his first game without Allen in Week 5.\n\nReynolds was evidently placed on injured reserve in Week 10, after suffering a hip injury during practice in Week 8.\n\nFantasy Impact: Reynolds' absence clears the way for new Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to be active on game day.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jackson has finished as a QB1 twice since Week 9. He faces the Patriots' capable defense in Week 16. He is a highly volatile, high-end QB2.\n\nHill will not play in Week 13. Head coach John Harbaugh said Monday that Hill could return \"in three to four weeks.\"\n\nFantasy Impact: Running back Keaton Mitchell will continue operating as the clear-cut No. 2 in Baltimore.\n\nHiggins missed Week 13 with a concussion. He was placed back into protocol following Week 14 after reporting symptoms after the game and did not play in Week 15. He remains limited at the beginning of Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: A second concussion in two calendar weeks is a significant issue for Higgins. Bengals tight end Mike Gesicki would benefit if Higgins misses time.\n\nNjoku aggravated his knee injury in Week 14. He was ruled out for Week 15 and remains sidelined in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: We expect rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. to continue operating as the team's No. 1 pass catcher. Start Fannin with confidence after a career game a week ago.\n\nSampson was sidelined by the calf injury in Week 15. He has not yet resumed practicing.\n\nFantasy Impact: Fellow rookie RB Quinshon Judkins earned four targets with Sampson out last week, tying his career-high. Judkins totaled minus-four yards on three receptions, though. He is an inefficient receiver.\n\nThe Browns signed running back Trayveon Williams after placing Ford on injured reserve this week.\n\nFantasy Impact: Williams is unlikely to contribute on game day, now occupying the No. 3 role. We expect No. 2 running back Dylan Sampson (calf/hand) to continue playing through injury.\n\nThe Steelers did not experience any fantasy-relevant injuries in their Week 15 win over the Dolphins.\n\nFantasy Football Defense (DST) Week 16 Rankings and Streamers\n\nEric Samulski breaks down his fantasy football defense rankings for Week 16 of the NFL season\n\nMarks was unable to finish the team's Week 15 win over the Cardinals due to an ankle injury. He did not practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach DeMeco Ryans told reporters Monday that Marks \"should be fine\" moving forward, and that he likely could have returned against the Cardinals.\n\nChubb was unable to finish the team's Week 14 win over the Chiefs due to a ribs injury and did not play in Week 15. He returned to practice in a limited capacity on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Chubb could handle double-digit touches if Marks is unable to play.\n\nMixon was placed on the Non-Football Injury list ahead of Week 1. He is not expected to play this year.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran Nick Chubb is now in a game script-dependent rushing role, while rookie running back Woody Marks operates as the starter.\n\nJones played through a fracture in his fibula for two-plus games before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 14. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury comes at the worst possible time for the sliding Colts, who have dropped from the two-seed to the fringes of playoff contention in three short weeks. Making matters worse, Riley Leonard suffered a knee injury in relief duties against the Jaguars. The Colts signed potential Hall of Fame candidate Philip Rivers, who is set to draw another start in Week 16.\n\nLeonard suffered a PCL sprain in Week 14. He is practicing fully.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran grandfather Philip Rivers was elevated from the practice squad to start in Week 15 against the Seahawks.\n\nRichardson suffered a \"freak accident\" ahead of Week 6 in which an elastic band snapped a piece of metal hit him in the eye, fracturing his orbital bone. He was placed on injured reserve. He was medically cleared to resume practicing on Monday, but he is not a candidate to start.\n\nFantasy Impact: Richardson was medically cleared to practice Monday but the team already named veteran Philip Rivers the starter for Week 16.\n\nTuten underwent successful surgery on his finger Monday and will miss the remainder of the season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Tuten's injury leaves Travis Etienne alone in the backfield, although the team signed journeyman DeeJay Dallas on Tuesday. Etienne carries clear league-winning upside in a likely robust role for the remainder of the season. Rookie running back LeQuint Allen can be stashed.\n\nHunter was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending LCL tear.\n\nFantasy Impact: See Thomas' section above.\n\nFantasy Impact: Helm should be good to go for TE2-worthy duties.\n\nRidley reportedly broke his fibula in Week 11 and is out for the season.\n\nFantasy Impact: It's a disappointing end to a disappointing season for the veteran receiver. The Titans are left with no standout fantasy options in his absence.\n\nBryant managed to suit up on Sunday after straining his hamstring in Week 14's Thursday practice session. He was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Bryant is back on the FLEX radar against the Jaguars.\n\nHarvey is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Harvey is a locked-in RB2 against the Jaguars.\n\nDobbins was ruled out on Friday before being placed on IR on Saturday. The injury requires surgery, likely ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie RJ Harvey is in line to see a noticeable increase to what has been a modest snap rate, although Tyler Badie remained frustratingly involved. Jaleel McLaughlin also saw increased opportunities on early downs.\n\nRice “reported concussion symptoms on Monday and entered the league’s protocol,” jeopardizing his availability against the Titans. He did not practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton is also in the NFL's concussion protocol. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce could handle a sizable workload in Week 16.\n\nMahomes suffered a season-ending ACL tear with an associated LCL tear in the Chiefs' Week 15 loss to the Chargers. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Mahomes underwent successful surgery Monday to repair both ligaments, thusly starting an estimated nine-month recovery timetable. Gardner Minshew will start for the Chiefs for the remainder of the season after the team was eliminated from postseason contention in Week 15.\n\nBrown was ruled out for Week 15 Friday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Although not a direct benefit to any singular player, both JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton have fewer bodies to compete with for rotational snaps.\n\nSmith missed the Raiders' Week 15 game against the Eagles after entering Week 14 with a foot injury and exiting with a throwing shoulder injury and significant abrasions on his throwing hand's ring and pinky fingers. Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said there is a \"good chance\" Smith will start in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Texans' elite defense can be safely expected to keep Smith in the low-end QB2 range this week.\n\nJohnston was added to the team's injury report on Friday with a groin issue and did not play in Week 15. He resumed practicing the following Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Johnston is back on the boom-bust FLEX radar against a wide receiver-friendly Cowboys defense.\n\nHarris ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg during the Chargers' Week 3 win over the Broncos. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal are likely to continue splitting backfield work until the former can work his way back into game shape.\n\n10 Fantasy Football Takeaways from Week 15: Kyle Pitts rises, Justin Jefferson falls\n\nOn the heels of a historic performance, Kyle Pitts is rising up the fantasy ranks ahead of Week 16. Justin Jefferson, on the other hand, is in freefall.\n\nWilliams injured his neck early in the Cowboys' Week 16 game against the Vikings. Although he missed snaps, including opportunities in the red zone, he did manage to play through it. He was limited on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Williams is a low-end RB1 against the Chargers.\n\nFantasy Impact: Ferguson was hampered by the injury last week. His return to full participation is a good sign.\n\nSanders was injured in Week 4 and did not play in Week 5. He was ruled out for Week 6 before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran Javonte Williams continues to operate in a near workhorse role.\n\nNabers suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 4 win over the Chargers and will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury could not have come at a worse time for the Giants after they moved to rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart under center. Nabers' absence will make it difficult to consistently move the football, lowering the upside of all remaining healthy players. Nabers makes for a solid trade target for dynasty managers looking to rebuild this season.\n\nSkattebo suffered a gruesome dislocated ankle in the team's Week 8 loss to the Eagles, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: The backfield in New York should revert to a timeshare headed by veteran Tyrone Tracy in Skattebo's absence. Devin Singletary remains on hand for change-of-pace duties. Treat Tracy as a low-end RB2 for the remainder of the season.\n\nBarkely resumed practicing on Wednesday after sitting out on Tuesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: It would be nice to see Barkley practice fully on Thursday. He is a borderline RB1/2 against the Commanders.\n\nDaniels dislocated the elbow in his left, non-throwing arm in the team's Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. He was ruled out for the remainder of the season Monday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Backup quarterback Marcus Mariota will start for the Commanders in the final three weeks of the regular season. He is a borderline QB1/2.\n\nRodriguez did not practice on Wednesday and did not play in Week 15. He is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt rushed 18 times for 96 yards and a touchdown with Rodriguez sidelined last week, which should return Croskey-Merritt to the starting role. This is worth following closely. Stay tuned.\n\nThe team placed Brown on injured reserve on Monday, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: None. Brown has not been fantasy-relevant all season.\n\nErtz suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 14 loss to the Vikings. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: The hits keep on coming for the Commanders in a lost season. John Bates should step into a significant role for the Commanders down the stretch but likely does not carry enough upside for weekly fantasy consideration.\n\nOdunze returned to practice on Wednesday and missing all of Week 14. He was removed from the injury report for Week 15 before missing the game after aggravating the injury in pre-game warmups. He has not yet resumed practicing.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Ben Johnson told reporters Monday that \"all options are on the table\" regarding Odunze's status moving forward. That does not inspire confidence that he will be available in the coming weeks.\n\nBurden injured his ankle in Week 15 and has been unable to practice since.\n\nFantasy Impact: Bears tight end Colston Loveland, and wide receivers DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus should receive notable target share bumps if Odunze and Burden are both sidelined. Tight end Cole Kmet (knee/ankle) was also limited on Wednesday.\n\nSwift was not on Tuesday's injury report. He was added to Wednesday's injury report as a limited participant, which could indicate that he aggravated the groin injury he dealt with earlier this year.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie running back Kyle Monangai would vault into the RB1 tier if Swift cannot face the Packers this week.\n\nWright landed hard on his neck in Week 12. He has been placed on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Backup tight ends Shane Zylstra (knee) and Ross Dwelley form a fantasy-unfriendly duo, who should only be considered in DFS lineups.\n\nLaPorta was added to the Lions’ injury report with a back injury on Wednesday. After being ruled out for Week 11 on Friday, the Lions placed him on injured reserve on Saturday.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Lions’ pass-catching corps is deep. Removing LaPorta from it could result in one or more extra targets for WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR Jameson Williams and RB Jahmyr Gibbs.\n\nJacobs reportedly aggravated his knee injury in the team's Week 15 loss to the Broncos. His knee also reportedly \"stiffened\" up in Week 14 against the Bears. Aggravations in consecutive games are concerning. He missed Week 16's first two practices.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Monday that Jacobs \"would not have practiced\" had the team held a regular session. He should continue to see his practice reps managed and could be in line to miss Week 16 against the Bears. No. 2 running back Emanuel Wilson must be rostered.\n\nWatson was unable to finish the team's Week 15 loss to the Broncos after landing hard on his shoulder on a Jordan Love interception in the third quarter. Watson told reporters that he \"should be good” to play in Week 16 against the Bears.\n\nFantasy Impact: Watson is a high-upside WR3.\n\nKraft suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the team's Week 9 loss to the Panthers.\n\nFantasy Impact: Kraft's breakout season comes to an end prematurely after the untimely knee injury. Luke Musgrave should be rostered in all formats as he likely enters a featured role for the Packers.\n\nWentz will undergo season-ending surgery after playing through a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum.\n\nFantasy Impact: Second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy is the starter in Minnesota moving forward.\n\nLondon reportedly suffered a PCL sprain in the team's Week 11 loss to the Panthers. Head coach Raheem Morris labeled London \"day-to-day\" in Week 15, but the team ultimately ruled him out. He returned to practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Tight end Kyle Pitts has operated as the passing game's top option with London sidelined. London's practice participation level should help us determine his expected involvement if he is cleared to play this week. Stay tuned.\n\nPenix reportedly suffered a knee injury that included a partially torn ACL, a separate sprain and a bone bruise in the team's Week 11 loss to the Panthers. He will undergo season-ending ACL reconstruction.\n\nFantasy Impact: That leaves the team in the hands of veteran Kirk Cousins moving forward. Cousins notably completed 21-of-31 passes for only 173 yards with no touchdowns in his only other start this season, which came against an underperforming Dolphins team. The Falcons could be in some trouble the rest of the way.\n\nMcMillan did not practice on Wednesday. The team hopes to get him back on Thursday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Panthers slot receiver Jalen Coker is playing very well. He would likely hog targets if McMillan cannot play this week.\n\nNeal departed the team's Week 15 win over the Panthers with a hamstring injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled him out for Week 16 against the Jets.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Saints promoted running back Evan Hull to the active roster in November. Running back Audric Estime was promoted to the active roster for last week's game. Neither player ran efficiently, but Estime was surprisingly used effectively via screen passes and checkdowns. Estime could be the starter this week.\n\nVele could not finish the team's Week 15 win over the Panthers due to a shoulder injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled Vele out for Week 16 against the Jets.\n\nFantasy Impact: Mason Tipton would be next in line for snaps at wide receiver alongside Chris Olave, should Vele be unable to go in Week 16. Olave became quarterback Tyler Shough's go-to receiver after Vele left early in Week 15.\n\nKamara remains sidelined by his ankle injury and PCL sprain. He has neither practiced nor played since Week 12 and was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He remains sidelined to begin Week 16.\n\nMiller suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 7 loss to the Bears. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie Devin Neal should step into the primary change-of-pace role for the Saints in Miller's absence. Lead back Alvin Kamara saw the highest snap rate since Week 2 following Miller's departure and could be again looking at a workhorse role moving forward.\n\nOtton is doubtful to play in Week 15 against the Falcons. He did not play. Otton was limited to begin Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Payne Durham is the next man up at tight end for the Buccaneers, although he remains unlikely to contribute in a meaningful way on Thursday Night Football.\n\nEvans was limited on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: This is likely just load management. Evans should be good to go for Week 16, without restrictions.\n\nHarrison picked up a heel injury in his return to the lineup following a two-game absence due to an appendectomy. He was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He has resumed practicing in a limited capacity.\n\nFantasy Impact: Wide receiver Michael Wilson has established himself as an elite fantasy starter in Harrison's absence. If Harrison returns, both players can be viewed as WR3s.\n\nThe Cardinals placed Knight on injured reserve Monday, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Michael Carter and Emari Demercado should split work in the backfield for the rest of the season.\n\nThe Cardinals placed Dortch on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Wide receiver Michael Wilson will continue earning targets voluminously.\n\nBenson underwent surgery after injuring his meniscus in Week 4. The Cardinals opened his 21-day practice window in Week 12, but they ultimately decided not to activate him from injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Running back Bam Knight is seemingly the best bet to operate as the Cardinals' rest-of-season starter.\n\nMurray injured his foot on a fourth-quarter fumble in Week 5. He was placed on injured reserve in Week 10 and will be eligible to return in Week 14 against the Rams, though it could be as the Cardinals' backup. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Monday that the team will not open his 21-day practice window this week.\n\nFantasy Impact: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has finished as a QB1 in his last three games. He remains a viable streamer.\n\nConner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3.\n\nFantasy Impact: See: Trey Benson.\n\nJones suffered a torn Achilles in the team's Week 10 loss to the Seahawks, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jones filled a situational role for the Cardinals but his absence could provide additional run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.\n\nAdams played through the hamstring strain without suffering a reported re-injury in Week 14. He aggravated the injury in the team's Week 15 win and was unable to finish the game. He is doubtful for Week 16 against the Seahawks on Thursday night.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Sean McVay told reporters Monday that Adams could be a game-time decision for Week 16. It would appear to be highly unlikely that Adams plays on a short week, potentially setting up an offensive game plan built around 13-personnel. Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua referred to wide receiver Konata Mumphield as Adams' \"apprentice.\" Mumphield could warrant boom-bust FLEX consideration, though he has no fantasy floor.\n\nHigbee was placed on injured reserve after suffering an ankle injury in the team's Week 11 win over the Seahawks.\n\nFantasy Impact: Higbee's absence for much of the game against the Seahawks simply allowed rookie Terrance Ferguson to step into additional snaps as opposed to forcing the team to move away from their league-leading 13-personnel rates. Colby Parkinson should be viewed as the team's starter. Davis Allen is capable as well. The Panthers struggle to cover opposing tight ends.\n\nPearsall injured both his knee and ankle in the team's Week 15 win.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters on Monday that \"there is concern\" about Pearsall's injuries. Missed time could force Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson into increased run.\n\nHead coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Aiyuk's 21-day practice window ahead of a Week 11 meeting with the Cardinals. The same was said for Week 12, and now Week 13. Reports then surfaced that Aiyuk and the 49ers are \"headed for divorce\" after the team voided his 2025 guarantees.\n\nFantasy Impact: A mostly lost season for Aiyuk appears to be quickly approaching, at least as far as fantasy is concerned.\n\nArroyo is \"out right now\" with a knee injury.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury allows tight end AJ Barner to assume a full-time role.\n\nHorton was added to the injury report Thursday with multiple ailments and did not play in Week 10 against the Cardinals. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Friday and remains sidelined early in Week 12. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.\n\nFantasy Impact: It's unfortunate timing for the blazing rookie after his breakout performance in Week 9.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers are still annoyed that they let Thursday night's game slip through their fingers.\n\nUp 28-14 in the fourth quarter against the Atlanta Falcons, the offense stumbled, and the defense couldn't get a stop as Kirk Cousins led a superb comeback that embarrassed the Buccaneers.\n\nWith plenty of blame to go around on both sides of the ball, with Todd Bowles' defense horrific, and Baker Mayfield and Co. unable to score enough points.\n\nFor Mike Evans, who marked his return to the team with a monster 132-yard game, does he think the unit has to score more than 28 points each week?\n\n“Absolutely,” Evans said. “As a offense, especially with the amount of talented players that we have, we're going to go out there and put up way more than that. Especially after we watch film and see how much meat we left on the bone, it's unacceptable for offense of this caliber.”\n\nMore:Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield has pointed message for Todd Bowles doubters\n\nYou could make that case, but every offense wants to score touchdowns on every single drive, but that isn't reality.\n\nIn truth, 28 points should have been more than enough for the Buccaneers to beat the Falcons, and as far as Evans saying 28 points is unacceptable for the offense, looking around the league, Tampa Bay should be happy with that.\n\nOnly six teams average 28 points or more per game.\n\nSo, it isn't an easy thing to do week in, week out, but that is the standard given the abundance of weapons on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nAt least we know the pass mark this week in Carolina for the Buccaneers -- score more than 28 points.\n\nBaker Mayfield shoulders blame for Buccaneers' collapse against Falcons\n\nBucky Irving's frustrating lack of usage near goal line explained by Bucs reporter\n\nTodd Bowles points finger after Bucs' loss to Falcons and it wasn't at the coaches\n\nBuccaneers vs. Falcons final score, results: Kirk Cousins, Falcons storm back from 14-point deficit to shock Buccaneers",

As always, at OneFootball, we bring you the star, the surprise, and the disappointment.\n\nAfter his goal against Alavés, the Frenchman started as a key player against Talavera today, continuing his pursuit of Cristiano Ronaldo's goal record.\n\nToday, he scored another double in a match where he didn't shine, but he remains incredibly lethal.\n\nWithout a doubt, the big surprises happened today. Albacete knocked out Celta on penalties, and Cultural Leonesa did it in regular time against Levante.\n\nOn the other hand, the great hero was Racing de Santander, who eliminated the third-placed team in LaLiga from the Copa del Rey. With these three eliminations, we now have eight top-tier teams knocked out.\n\nUndoubtedly, the season for the red and whites is more than irregular, and today they provided another example of it.\n\nCoudet's team stood up to Almeyda's and ended up eliminating them from the Copa del Rey thanks to Vicente's goal from the penalty spot.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker: 'Suggesting the Bears would move to Indiana is a startling slap in the face to all the beloved and loyal fans'",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears released an open letter to fans Wednesday night that said the franchise is considering Northwest Indiana as a location for a new stadium.\n\nThe team has been seeking tax breaks and nearly $900 million in public funding, according to media reports, to build a stadium in Cook County, the most recent target being Arlington Heights, a Chicago suburb. But Bears President and CFO Kevin Warren said in the letter the team is not receiving a \"sense of urgency or appreciation to date\" from the state.\n\n\"We have been told directly by state leadership our project will not be a priority in 2026,\" Warren said. “Consequently, in addition to Arlington Park, we need to expand our search and critically evaluate opportunities throughout the wider Chicagoland region, including Northwest Indiana.\n\n“This is not about leverage. We spent years trying to build a new home in Cook County. ... Our fans deserve a world-class stadium. Our players and coaches deserve a venue that matches the championship standard they strive for every day. With that in mind, our organization must keep every credible pathway open to deliver that future.\"\n\nGov. JB Pritzker didn't hold back in his response Warren offering Indiana as an option for the Bears.\n\n“Suggesting the Bears would move to Indiana is a startling slap in the face to all the beloved and loyal fans who have been rallying around the team during this strong season,” a Pritzker spokesman said in a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times. “The Governor’s a Bears fan who has always wanted them to stay in Chicago. He has also said that ultimately they are a private business that makes their own decisions, but the Governor has also been clear that the bottom line for any private business development should not come at the full expense of taxpayers.”\n\nIn a letter to season-ticket holders, #Bears president/CEO Kevin Warren says Illinois state leadership told the team its proposed stadium in Arlington Heights won’t be a priority in 2026. \n\nWarren says, consequently, the team will expand its search, including Northwest Indiana. pic.twitter.com/EWTEsriRSv\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) December 17, 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Chicago Bears moving: Team considering Northwest Indiana for stadium",

    "description": "Jarred Vanderbilt sparked the Lakers' defensive effort in the win over Phoenix on Sunday, but they'll need their stars to contribute as well against Utah.",
    "fullText": "They saw how “contagious” it was when playing defense at a high level against the Suns and how Jarred Vanderbilt lit the fuse to ignite things for the Lakers in their last victory over Phoenix.\n\nAnd for the Lakers to maintain that defensive mindset, stars Luka Doncic and LeBron James also have to be committed to that end of the court.\n\nThat was the message from Lakers coach JJ Redick to Doncic and James.\n\n\"Yeah, it was good,\" Doncic said. \"We talked about a lot, not just that, but he was right. You got to get a little big more, especially from the star players. So that's on us. That's on me. And we just got to give more, especially at the start of the game. We got to start the game better. But I think in Phoenix, we did a pretty good job. The plan was focused on ourselves and [our] defensive mentality, so I think we did a pretty good job.\"\n\nThe Lakers will be tested again on defense by the Utah Jazz Thursday night in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Jazz have a developing star in Lauri Markkanen, a difficult matchup at 7-foot-1 who is ninth in the NBA in scoring at 27.8 points per game, and a young talent in guard Keyonte George, who is averaging 23.5 points and 6.8 assists.\n\nUtah is fourth in the league in pace (102.98), ninth in scoring (119.0), second in assists (29.8). The Jazz are fifth in rebounds (45.7), eighth in offensive rebounds (12.6), and 12th in field-goal percentage.\n\n\"The way we play, we got to approach every game the same,\" Doncic said. \"In the NBA, every team is dangerous, so at some point somebody can go for 40. They have Markkanen, and then George. They can go for 40 on any night. So we just got to work on ourselves and approach the game, make everything the same.\"\n\nThe all-out energy and effort by Vanderbilt off the bench was the catalyst for the Lakers against the Suns.\n\nIn his 15 minutes of action, he had seven ponits, seven rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot.\n\nVanderbilt had played only three minutes and eight seconds over a 10-game stretch prior to that point.\n\n“Vando's minutes were huge,” Gabe Vincent said. “He came in and does what we all know he's very capable of doing and being disruptive on the defensive end, crashing the glass, getting extra possessions for us, all of which we desperately needed. You know what I mean? So his spark off the bench was huge for us.\"\n\nNow it’s about sustaining that defensive intensity, the Lakers say. And about playing with that physicality, the Lakers say.\n\n“Yeah, when you guys asked me this the last time, it’s effort,” Jake LaRavia said. “If we just go out there and we give that kind of effort every night…We got a lot of guys on the team. Some guys might not be having it and, like you said about that contagious word, that really helps out. (Marcus) Smart does it sometimes. Vando does it sometimes. I would say I do it just being a contagious type of person to help lead the team and just being extra physical.”\n\nThe Lakers are ranked near the bottom of the league in some defensive categories, which means there remains room for improvement.\n\nThey are ranked 17th in the league in points allowed (116.7), 24th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) allowed and 28th in three-point shooting (38.1%) allowed.\n\n“You just got to go out there and do it,” LaRavia said. “It’s not anything a coach can say. It’s not anything a player can tell another player. Yeah, it’s like the individual player’s job to go out there and give effort on defense and that’s contagious. It just goes around.”\n\nLakers center Deandre Ayton on Wednesday was named by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Assn. as the winner of the Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for November. Ayton was recognized for his philanthropic work across the Bahamas, which is his home country, Jamaica and Los Angeles through the Ayton Family Foundation.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

And it could have been more...\n\nIn the Intercontinental final against PSG, Jorginho even converted the penalty that took the match to extra time and penalties.\n\nThe midfielder, however, was substituted at the 28th minute of the second half.

    "fullText": "Scarlet Knights across a wide variety of fall and winter sports earned recognition this past week, headlined by national podium finishes, conference and national honors, and academic acknowledgements. This includes preseason, midseason, and postseason awards, watch lists, and national medals.\n\nRutgers divers Bailee Sturgill and Katerina Hoffman had a standout showing at the 2025 USA Diving Winter Nationals, teaming up to earn a silver medal in the synchronized platform event with a second-place score of 488.91. Additionally, Sturgill added a second silver medal on synchronized 3M, as she teamed up with Lilly Witte of Indiana. The duo had a final score of 528.12, trailing the winning duo by roughly 31 points.\n\nSturgill and Witte won the synchronized 3M event in May during the USA Diving Nationals, but were unable to go back-to-back. Sturgill also competed on the 3M dive, while Hoffman also competed in the 1M and 3M events.\n\nSturgill was previously named the Big Ten Diver of the Week after winning the 3M dive against Princeton in November. She currently holds a spot on Rutgers’ all-time top-10 list in the 1M, 3M, and platform dive.\n\nAt the 2025 Winter Junior Nationals, Emilana Gonzalez finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle at the East Regionals on the campus of Indiana University. She posted a time of 22.40, which was the second-fastest time in Rutgers program history. Several other Rutgers signees competed at the US Junior Nationals, as the Scarlet Knights recently announced a talented eight-person class.\n\nStar running back Antwan Raymond picked up a major college football award, winning the Cornish Trophy as the most outstanding Canadian player in NCAA football. He was also named a semifinalist for the Doak Walker National Running Back Award. Safety Jett Elad was also named as one of the five finalists for the award.\n\nRutgers football previously earned key All-Big Ten honors as star wideout KJ Duff and Raymond were selected Second Team All-Big Ten by both coaches and media. In addition, OL Kwabena Asamoah, WR Ian Strong, and DB Bo Mascoe were selected as Big Ten Honorable Mentions by coaches and media.\n\nElad and placekicker Jai Patel were selected by conference coaches as Big Ten Honorable Mentions, while the media selected punter Jakob Anderson and linebacker Dariel Djabome for the same honors. Offensive lineman Gus Zilinskas was also given the Big Ten Sportsmanship Award.\n\nRutgers star defender Puck Winter was named a 2025 Second Team All-American by the NFHCA yesterday after recording 31 defensive saves as a four-year starter for the Scarlet Knights. She scored 17 career goals with four assists for 38 points, with five goals, three assists, and six defensive saves in 2025, ranking second in the Big Ten and fifth nationally. Winter was also previously named the National Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nEarlier this offseason, Puck Winter and captain Paulina Niklaus were also named First Team All-Mid-Atlantic Region, First Team All-Big Ten, and First Team All-ECAC. Olivia de Zwaan, Emily Nicholls, and Martha Goodridge won Freshman of the Week during the season, with Nicholls and Winter also earning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nGraduate student Emily Leese and senior Gabrielle Dildy were each named Big Ten Gymnasts to watch by the conference on Tuesday. Dildy made the list for the second straight year after a 2025 season in which she qualified as an individual on beam at the NCAA Regional Championships.\n\nHer score of 9.850 also helped Rutgers qualify for NCAA Regionals for the first time in 11 seasons. She earned several team awards, including Most Valuable Gymnast, and led the Scarlet Knights with a 9.850 on floor and 9.800 on vault at the conference meet last season. She has career highs of 9.900 on vault, beam, and floor.\n\nLeese is ready to make her return to competition after missing the 2025 season rehabbing from injury. She owns the program record in the vault with a 9.925, which Leese accomplished in both 2023 and 2024. She qualified for the 2023 NCAA Regionals on vault and boasts a 9.925 career high on floor and a 9.850 on beam. She is also a team captain for the second straight year and has a multitude of academic Big Ten honors to her name.\n\nRutgers will open their 2026 season with a tri-meet shortly after the New Year, hosting Temple and Brockport at Jersey Mike’s Arena on January 4th.\n\nRutgers also celebrated academic excellence this week with 141 student-athletes named to the 2025 Fall Academic All-Big Ten list, representing a wide range of programs, including football and other fall varsity sports.\n\nCassidy Kidd (women’s cross country), Graham Kois (men’s soccer), and Rachel Quigley (women’s soccer) were highlighted on the Big Ten’s list for their perfect 4.0 GPAs. 65 football players were named to the list, including Sean Cooper, Bryan Felter, Henry Hughes Jr., Tyler Needham, Michael O’Connor, and Gus Zilinskas, who earned the honor four times as Rutgers student-athletes.\n\nEach of the 141 student-athletes was on a fall varsity team, enrolled full-time at the institution for a minimum of 12 months, and received a cumulative term GPA of 3.0 or higher, showing the university’s commitment to balancing strong athletics and academics.\n\nTo support me and my work, please follow @arnavsarkar100 on X!",

When asked for his prediction, Paul kept it bold and simple: \"It’s going to be the biggest upset in sports history.\"\n\nPaul doubled down on his prediction, comparing his impending victory to the monumental Giants-Patriots Super Bowl upset of 2007 and dramatically calling the event \"the Boston Tea Party 2.0.\" As always, he was not afraid to say what was on his mind, providing some soundbite-worthy moments throughout the night.\n\nMeanwhile, the veteran Joshua— stepping back into the ring after a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois— remained composed, focusing on his professional approach.The tension was palpable when Joshua's viral quote, \"If I can kill him, I’ll kill him,\" was brought up; he had an icy calm response, stating simply, \"It’s my job.\"\n\nFinally, as the two faced off, it was exactly what fans came to expect: a smaller, confident Paul against a silent former heavyweight champion of the world. Soon enough, the two will decide it in the ring.\n\nThe Sporting News followed all the action from Wednesday night’s press conference.

    "fullText": "MIAMI, Fla. — Thursday, Cardinal Newman (West Palm Beach) pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the 2025 FHSAA state championships. The Crusaders took down four-time defending state champions Chaminade-Madonna (Hollywood) in a 17-14 victory.\n\nThe leader of the Newman defense was three-star LB Adam Balogoun-Ali, who ended his high school career in the best possible way.\n\n“There’s no better way to end it,” Balogoun-Ali said after the win. “It’s not even a bittersweet feeling—just pure joy. I love my guys. I’m so glad we could get this done.”\n\nChaminade was the favorite going into the game, but Newman proved that any team can win on any given day.\n\n“It’s just a jersey. It’s just a name. They’re not the same team that they were. We knew if we came in and punched them in the mouth, we could win this game, and that’s what happened.”\n\nThe Benjamin School transfer feels he’s grown exponentially in his senior year at Newman and credits head coach Jack Daniels with instilling a culture that laid the foundation for the school’s first state championship.\n\n“This is a more complicated defense. I would say the biggest thing I learned was how to take in all the info really fast, especially when [offenses] are going quickly, as Chaminade did. I think learning the [college] playbook will be much easier now that I’ve come to Newman this year.\n\n“Coach Jack Daniels ‘ culture that he set at Cardinal Newman is superb. It’s unlike anything I’ve been a part of, and I’m really glad could learn from it.”\n\nAhead of the state title game, the Auburn signee received some motivational words from the newly formed Tiger staff.\n\n“The whole staff has been really supportive. They were telling me it’s just another game and to do me.”\n\nAuburn defensive coordinator DJ Durkin, who was instrumental in landing Balogoun-Ali’s signing, was retained by the program, much to the delight of the Tiger signee.\n\n“This is why I went to Auburn. I want to be coached by him. I really believe in what he does development-wise and scheme-wise. I think we are going to do great things over there at Auburn.”\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 210-pound backer is confident with his signing with Auburn and believes in what new head coach Alex Golesh is building on the Plains.\n\n“There was a lot of doubt about where people were going and all that, but personally, with me, I’m excited. I think it’s going to be a good time. With Coach Golesh as our new head coach, I think our offense will get going a lot, and our defense is already elite. I think in one or two years we’ll be a top team.”",

Because a loss would nearly be the end of Baltimore's playoff chances via the AFC North, especially if the Pittsburgh Steelers win.\n\nGiven that Pittsburgh has to tackle the Detroit Lions, it is all on the line for the Ravens to put all the pressure on the Steelers by beating the Patriots.\n\nBut tight end Mark Andrews isn't looking too far ahead; he's focused on Sunday.\n\n“We're trying to take it week by week,” Andrews said. “Obviously, a very important game and we're not overlooking that aspect.”\n\nMore:Ravens' John Harbaugh reveals 'bottom line' to playoff hopes | Sporting News\n\nThe 24-0 win over the Cincinnati Bengals was perhaps one of the best games from the Ravens this season.\n\nThe defense pitched a shutout, but the offense was efficient, with Lamar Jackson making only 12 pass attempts (completing 8), so more of that against New England will be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nBut can the Ravens carry over last week's performance and bring it against New England?\n\nI think so,\" Andrews added. \"We're going to continue to build on what this team could do, being efficient, playing great football, all those good things.

In this instance, the Snicko system used in Australia is different from the Ultraedge employed for Tests in the UK.\n\nFollow day two of the third Ashes Test live\n\nSnicko operator error behind controversial Carey reprieve\n\nCarey was on 72 at the time he was reprieved and went on to make a crucial 106.\n\nSpeaking at the close of the play, the left-hander said: \"I thought there was a feather or some sort of noise when it passed the bat,\" said Carey.\n\n\"If I was given out I think I would have reviewed it, probably not confidently. It was a nice sound as it passed the bat.\"\n\nThe error in the review was explained as Snicko using the sound captured by the stump microphone at the non-striker's end, rather than the striker's end.\n\n\"Given that Alex Carey admitted he had hit the ball in question, the only conclusion that can be drawn from this, is that the Snicko operator at the time must have selected the incorrect stump mic for audio processing,\" BBG told BBC Sport.\n\n\"In light of this, BBG Sports takes full responsibility for the error.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Washington running back Adam Mohammed plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, On3 has learned. He ran for 523 yards this season.\n\nMohammed spent the last two seasons in Seattle and took on a larger role in 2025. He took 106 carries for 523 yards and five touchdowns as a sophomore and had 17 receptions for 138 yards in the passing game.\n\nAs a freshman in 2024, Adam Mohammed ran for 193 yards while adding 41 receiving yards. A product of Glendale (Ariz.) Apollo, he will have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nWashington put together a strong second season under Jedd Fisch in 2025, completing a 9-4 campaign with a victory over Boise State in the LA Bowl last week. Quarterback Demond Williams shined in his first year as the full-time starter, completing 69.5% of his passes for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns, to eight interceptions. He also added 611 rush yards and six touchdowns on the ground.\n\nAfterward, Fisch discussed the importance of keeping core players in tact as he gets ready for Year 3. He said the goal is to maintain as much continuity as possible on the roster, and he specifically pointed to Williams’ importance given the way he played throughout the year.\n\n“I thought, if you look at Raiden Vines probably had his first touchdown, he’s a freshman,” Fisch said in his LA Bowl press conference. “Dezmen Roebuck back had his seventh touchdown of the season. He’s a freshman. Demond played elite. He’s a sophomore. We play with probably the most freshmen in all of college football. Plays that were being made by guys were all young players. Players for the most part that all have eligibility left.\n\n“Our goal obviously is to bring back as many players as we possibly can. I think our guys know that we’ve got a great season coming ahead of us. We’ve got a great team. They’re led by an elite player. When you have an elite quarterback, you’ve got a great opportunity to win a lot of games.”",

    "fullText": "Venezuela’s government has ordered its Navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, escalating the risk of a confrontation with the United States after President Trump ordered a “blockade” aimed at the country’s oil industry.\n\nSeveral ships sailed from the country’s east coast with a naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, according to three people familiar with the matter. The vessels departed just hours after Mr. Trump said he intended to blockade sanctioned oil tankers that do business with Venezuela.\n\nThe ships — transporting urea, petroleum coke and other oil-based products — left the Port of José bound for Asian markets, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The Venezuelan government imposed the military escort in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, they said.\n\nVessels traveling with the escort did not appear on a current list of U.S. sanctioned ships, making it unclear whether they could be subject to Mr. Trump’s blockade. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he was focused on oil tankers that have violated U.S. trade sanctions.\n\nThe third person familiar with the matter, a U.S. official, said Washington was aware of escorts and was considering various courses of action, but declined to provide details.\n\nVenezuela’s state oil company, known as PDVSA, said in a statement on Wednesday that ships connected to its operations were continuing to sail “with full security, technical support and operational guarantees in legitimate exercise of their right to free navigation.”\n\nMr. Trump had announced on Tuesday evening that he was imposing a “total and complete blockade” of tankers to and from Venezuela that had violated U.S. trade sanctions. Roughly 40 percent of the tankers that have transported Venezuelan crude in recent years have been placed under U.S. sanctions, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials last week seized an Asia-bound sanctioned tanker carrying nearly two million barrels of Venezuelan crude, a major escalation of Mr. Trump’s standoff with Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, whose government derives the bulk of its revenues from oil exports.\n\nU.S. officials have said in private in recent days that additional tankers carrying Venezuelan oil may be seized, without providing additional details.\n\nMr. Maduro has reacted to the seizure with anger and vowed to keep the oil exports flowing at all cost, said one of the three people.\n\nNicholas Nehamas and Rebecca F.

    "title": "Trump Administration Aims to Strip More Foreign-Born Americans of Citizenship",
    "description": "An official with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would prioritize “those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration plans to ramp up efforts to strip some naturalized Americans of their citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times, marking an aggressive new phase in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe guidance, issued on Tuesday to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, asks that they “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year. If the cases are successful, it would represent a massive escalation of denaturalization in the modern era, experts said. By comparison, between 2017 and this year to date, there had been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department.\n\nUnder federal law, people may be denaturalized only if they committed fraud while applying for citizenship, or in a few other narrow circumstances. But the Trump administration has shown a zeal for using every tool at its disposal to target legal and illegal immigrants, leading activists to warn that such a campaign could sweep up people who had made honest mistakes on their citizenship paperwork and sow fear among law-abiding Americans.\n\nThe guidance comes as Mr. Trump has spent much of this year closing loopholes in the immigration system and throwing up roadblocks for people seeking to enter and stay in the country. The sweeping campaign, which has gone further than purging the country of unlawful migrants, has included blocks on asylum at the southern border, a pause on asylum applications inside the United States, and a ban on entry for travelers from predominantly African and Middle Eastern nations. Officials say their actions will make the country safer and preserve the country’s values\n\nA targeted campaign to increase the number of American immigrants stripped of their citizenship represents an escalation of an already ambitious campaign.\n\n“It’s no secret that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ war on fraud includes prioritizing those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship — especially under the previous administration,” said Matthew J. Tragesser, a U.S.C.I.S. spokesman. “We will pursue denaturalization proceedings for those individuals lying or misrepresenting themselves during the naturalization process. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”\n\nIn interviews, some former agency officials expressed concern at the scale of the case goals for denaturalization pushed by U.S.C.I.S. leadership.\n\n“Imposing arbitrary numerical targets on denaturalization cases risks politicizing citizenship revocation,” said Sarah Pierce, a former U.S.C.I.S. official. “And requiring monthly quotas that are 10 times higher than the total annual number of denaturalizations in recent years turns a serious and rare tool into a blunt instrument and fuels unnecessary fear and uncertainty for the millions of naturalized Americans.”\n\nProponents of stricter immigration laws said it was necessary to more aggressively root out people who had been improperly granted citizenship.\n\n“I don’t think we’re anywhere close to denaturalizing too many people,” said Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors restrictive immigration policies. Mr. Krikorian said that the country was “so far from denaturalizing” enough people that such an effort would not pull in people who should not be targeted.\n\nThere are about 26 million naturalized Americans in the country, according to the Census Bureau. More than 800,000 new citizens were sworn in last year, most of whom were born in Mexico, India, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic or Vietnam, U.S.C.I.S. statistics show. Most people stripped of their citizenship revert to being legal permanent residents.\n\nThe new guidance on Tuesday was part of a document laying out U.S.C.I.S. priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October. Listed alongside such goals as “provide employee feedback opportunities” and “strengthen management of high-risk cases” was “pursue denaturalization.”\n\nThe Justice Department previously also said it would make denaturalization a priority this year. In a memo distributed in the summer, officials laid out their approach, saying they would target individuals in an array of categories beyond committing fraud in obtaining citizenship. Categories of eligible people include gang members, those who committed financial fraud, individuals connected to drug cartels and violent criminals, according to the department.\n\n“The civil division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,” the agency wrote in June.\n\nU.S.C.I.S. is a key player in the process of denaturalization. The agency refers cases to the Justice Department, which must go through a federal court to strip someone of their citizenship. The process can occur either through a civil or a criminal proceeding. During a civil case, government lawyers must have “unequivocal evidence” that someone obtained citizenship illegally or hid a material fact during the process.\n\nBecause the government must go through a challenging court process, denaturalization cases have been rare since the 1990s. A Bloomberg Law analysis found that denaturalization cases brought by the government since then peaked in 2018, when 90 criminal and civil cases were filed. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that citizenship and naturalization are too precious and fundamental to our democracy for the government to take it away on their whim. Instead of wasting resources digging through Americans’ files, U.S.C.I.S. should do its job of processing applications, as Congress mandated,” said Amanda Baran, a former senior U.S.C.I.S. official in the Biden administration.\n\nMr. Trump stepped up denaturalizations in his first term as well. In one widely publicized case, a New Jersey man born in India, Baljinder Singh, was stripped of his citizenship after the Justice Department found that he had arrived in the country without travel documents or proof of identity and that he had used a different name.\n\nThis year, the Justice Department has brought 13 denaturalization cases and won eight of them, according to Chad Gilmartin, an agency spokesman. Mr. Gilmartin said in a social media post earlier this year that there had been over 100 cases filed to the courts during the first Trump administration, compared with 24 during the Biden administration. In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must prove not only that someone had lied during the citizenship application process but that the lie had an impact on the underlying citizenship claim.\n\nExperts said that despite the ramp-up in referrals, the process to actually denaturalize someone would likely remain quite difficult, raising questions on whether the government will actually be able to get many cases through.\n\nStill, some had concerns about what the guidance could portend.\n\n“My fear would be that as we have seen in the arrest and removal context when D.H.S. employees are given arbitrary targets what happens is people who shouldn’t be swept up, get swept up and that you’re going to see that happening to people in this context as well,” said Margy O’Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy organization. “That could incite fear and terror amongst naturalized citizens.”",

    "description": "How can you possibly squeeze a 32-bit PlayStation CD ROM game into a small Game Boy Color Cartridge? Well, HotGen would attempt to do just that with a conversion of Resident Evil in mid-1999 and to make it as close as possible with similar 3D perspectives using scaled sprites.",
    "fullText": "How can you possibly squeeze a 32-bit PlayStation CD ROM game into a small Game Boy Color Cartridge? Well, HotGen would attempt to do just that with a conversion of Resident Evil in mid-1999 and to make it as close as possible with similar 3D perspectives using scaled sprites.\n\nThere were delays and a lot of struggles to cram everything in. There were of course a number of restrictions and tweaks made along the way, but HotGen had a pretty decent stab at it and had a title which was certainly pushing the 8-bit hardware.\n\nRetained were the original game’s locations, viewpoints, puzzles, pre-rendered backgrounds and dialogue. Characters and enemies were software-scaled, with technical compromises required due to the GBC’s limited CPU power and storage. Speech was replaced with text windows, but the structure of the PlayStation original remained largely intact.\n\nWhen we spoke to developer Nigel Speight as part of our book coverage in 2020, he had the following recollections about the development:\n\n“If I remember correctly I would say the game was about 75-85% complete. Originally the game was supposed to be about 35% of the original PlayStation version and we were going to elongate the storyline to keep reusing the rooms. However, as time went along Virgin kept upping the cartridge size and wanting more of the original content in. If I remember correctly I’d created an editor that allowed the 3d to be aligned to the screens and objects placed etc and I think that the last build we made didn’t include the final amount of content me and the artist Martin Smith had created.”\n\nThe game had been shown at places like E3 in 1999, and had been planned for release by the Christmas of that year – though delays meant it slipped into early 2000. By February 2000, the game was nearing completion and was being tested. However, Capcom decided to cancel the title, feeling that the game wasn’t up to scratch.\n\nAssistant programmer Pete Frith (back in 2020 when questioned by us) couldn’t recall the completion state, but felt it was more 98% finished, as there was a lot of communications between the team and QA testers at the end. He also recalls that the story they were told regarding the cancellation, was that the original creator of Resident Evil didn’t feel the GBC was worthy of his creation, and that he had personally instructed the cancellation. He also informed that the lead artist Martin Smith had sadly passed away.\n\nWhere Martin focused on the backgrounds, Simon Butler did the sprite work on the game. Mark Cooksey was then on hand to create all the music and sound effects, though many would not get properly integrated it seems.\n\nThankfully, in 2011 – two separate builds were preserved thanks to Kiff Storey and Bowker. One version was quite near to completion, but was missing intro titles and had debug screens on and was felt to be around 90% complete. A long-play online confirmed that the game wasn’t completable either for both characters.\n\nIn late 2025 however, Games That Weren’t have now preserved a final version of game at the point of cancellation and we have it here for you today to check out thanks to Pete Frith providing everything. Again, it isn’t 100% complete (perhaps now 98% – based on Pete’s estimates) – but there is more content and it *might* actually now be completable. Due to time constraints, we’ve not been able to sit and play through the title fully to confirm, as there might be scenes that glitch/bug out – if you find that it is, please do let us know!\n\nCrucially, we know that the Tyrant seems to be present at the end (see below) and its possible to trigger the end sequence compared to the earlier builds. We have a hack further below that jumps you near the end, so that you can see this for yourself.\n\nThe debug data present in other builds has been removed in the final build, and there are a set of introduction credit screens present in this version. Also, hacking through the game – the end sequences are in place too, which gives promise that the game may be completable in its current final state. Just in case it isn’t, we’ve created a few hacks which allow the following to unlock some unseen content:\n\n1) ResiEvilHack-EndingSelector: This allows you to just select either character and jump straight to the end sequences for both.\n\n2) ResiEvilHack-TyrantSegments: This hack jumps near towards the end of the game, where the tyrant is now walking around the final outside scene if you select Chris Redfield. If you select Jill Valentine, it starts you in the lab with the tyrant moving around (though its just their silloette).\n\nYou can’t seem to kill the Tyrant with the knife with Chris (though you might be able to find a weapon nearby). However, if you play with Jill and navigate towards the outside helicopter pad – the tyrant is there, and you can use your gun to kill them – triggering the end sequence.\n\n3) ResiEvilHack-SceneNMusicPlayer: This is quite a cool hack. Firstly, if you select either character – it will play through all the animated scenes for that player in sequence. It is likely there will be a few scenes here which were not used in the game or integrated. Then if you press “B” on the same selector screen, you will be able to play through all the SFX and pressing “SELECT” will cycle through all the tunes created by Mark Cooksey.\n\nIn a note found to the developers, Mark listed all the music and SFX as follows (with his original descriptions):\n\n0 Silence tune (Skipped in selector)\n 1 Long Background tune #1\n 2 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #1\n 3 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #2 *modified tune *\n 4 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #3 *new tune to replace old one *\n 5 Short Dramatic danger loop tune #4 * modified tune *\n 6 BG00 from res evil\n 7 Long Background tune #2\n 8 Long Background tune #3\n 9 Moonlight sonata correct\n 10 Moonlight sonata played badly correct\n 11 Long background tune #4\n 12 Girly end of game tune * new tune *\n\n0 Police card (char) select\n 1 Option move from one to another\n 2 select (highlight option)\n 3 Cancel\n 4 Wooden door open\n 5 Wooden door close\n 6 clock ticking VERSION 1 Looping\n 7 Stop clock 1 ticking\n 8 clock ticking VERSION 2 BETTER THAN 1 Lp\n 9 Stop clock 2 ticking\n 10 Footstep #1 on carpet\n 11 Single hard footstep\n 12 Double footstep #1 Gravel use together\n 13 Double footstep #2 left foot then RFoot\n 14 Long Footstep for wading through water\n 15 Gun shot #1 n\n 16 Gun shot #2\n 17 Knife swipe 1 Shorter\n 18 Knife swipe 2 Longer\n 19 Zombie Moan 1 (1 channel fx)\n 20 Zombie Moan 2 (2 channel fx more real)\n 21 Zombie Chomp (bite)\n 22 Teleprinter type sound 1 shot\n 23 Go on to next screen after pick char\n 24 Page Turn\n 25 Gun Reload 1 REVOLVER\n 26 Gun reload 2 Shotgun\n 27 Gun Reload 3 ???\n 28 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 29 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 30 Bloke Aaah being attacked.\n 31 Girl Aaah being attacked.\n 32 Push Furniture (continuous)\n 33 Stop push furniture\n 34 Bees\n 35 Break stone\n 36 Gate Noise\n 37 Lift start (loops)\n 38 Lift stop\n 39 Key open (key apar)\n 40 Power on\n 41 Computer key click\n\nIn addition to this, we have extracted out a set of assets used for the game – which may contain sprites/sequences not used in the final game. Also, the original WAV samples that Pete Frith created from his voice to make the speech on the title screen – including some versions that were not used :)\n\nWhat else have we established so far?\n\nIf you spot anything else – please feel free to get in touch or leave something in the comments and we’ll update the page over time. For now, we hope you enjoy taking a look at what has been recovered and enjoy the findings so far. We have also included two bonus builds that we also located which will have some minor differences too.\n\nWith a huge thank you to Pete Frith for allowing us to preserve and for the assets and to Nigel Speight for his recollections.",

    "fullText": "As a developer, a version control system is a critical part of your toolkit, no matter the size of the project or team you may find yourself working on.\n\nI first started learning to use git by applying it to my own projects and maintaining local repositories to track those projects. From there I moved on to hosting and storing my git repositories at Bitbucket while still working independently. My first experience with working alongside other developers in git came at my first full time development job on a small team (think tiny — two developers, myself included). I picked up the basics of branching, handling merges, developing different features in parallel and, ultimately, dealing with QA and production deployments that were sourced from various branches in our project repository.\n\nI've expanded on my knowledge git in the jobs I've held since that first position and have used svn pretty heavily as well (I don't mind it, but I don't love it — I'd argue git is the better choice for a number of reasons, its decentralized nature and flexibility being chief among them).\n\nOne of the many appeals of git is its flexibility and there are a wide range of commands that come with it. To get started, I'd suggest digging in with the following:\n\nEach of these commands has numerous options associated with it and allows for broad control over the flow and history of your project.

    "fullText": "Creators and publishers have long worried about Meta's ability to throttle links to outside content. Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.\n\nUnder the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot shared by social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that \"certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using \"professional mode\" on Facebook. Publishers aren't affected for now. \"This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhile Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it's a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which starts at $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular.\n\nHave a tip for Karissa?

    "description": "UCLA study finds gut microbes are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.",
    "fullText": "Gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, UCLA evolutionary biologists report in a new study. The researchers found that gene variants that help microbes digest starches found in ultra-processed foods have “swept” the genomes of some species of gut bacteria in industrialized parts of the world. Because these starches are industrially produced and have only been around for a few decades, scientists believe natural selection must have been acting strongly to make these genes dominant so quickly. What’s more, the researchers have discovered that bacteria are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.\n\nThe study’s findings, published in Nature, scanned the genomes of almost three dozen species of gut bacteria using data from around the world and identified a process called horizontal gene transfer, in which bacteria transfer DNA from one strain to another, as the mechanism for this rapid evolution. Horizontal gene transfer has previously been identified as the mechanism that allows bacteria to evolve antibiotic resistance so quickly, but the prevalence of this process in gut microbes has been relatively unknown until now.\n\n“The discovery that the ability to digest novel starches is a target of natural selection in gut bacteria is interesting, but we found an even more robust, stronger signal that there are different targets of selection across many genes and many species in industrialized and non-industrialized populations,” said UCLA doctoral student and paper first author Richard Wolff. “What are the gut microbiomes in industrialized populations responding to? We’ve picked out one example with these starches, but there’s likely many possibilities we haven’t grappled with yet.”\n\nWolff and corresponding author, UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Nandita Garud, developed a novel statistic that identifies locations in the DNA of 30 gut bacteria species where genes have risen to high frequency, or “swept,” in that species. The statistic looks for tiny regions of homogeneity against a backdrop of immense diversity separating different strains of the same species.\n\n“Different strains of E. coli, for example, have diverged from each other as much as humans have diverged from chimps, yet we call them the same species. Despite this diversity, there are still shared fragments of DNA present in many hosts — a hidden thread connecting our microbiomes,” said Garud.\n\nDifferent genes appeared to be selected for in industrialized and non-industrialized populations, and one gene in particular was sweeping only in industrialized populations. That gene is associated with the ability to digest maltodextrin, which is made from cornstarch and has been used in processed foods since the 1960s.\n\n“We saw the adaptive signal very strongly, but we can’t say for sure yet if it’s specializing in maltodextrin or a broader class of starch derivatives. There might be intermediate steps as the bacteria adapt to different starch sources,” said Wolff. “There are a lot of steps in between eating a diet full of cassava and breadfruit and a diet full of Hot Cheetos or something like that.”\n\nBacteria can take up DNA from their environment in many different ways: They can eat it; they can be infected by a virus that carries DNA between them; and it can be transmitted when bacteria clump together and form a bridge that allows them to move between each other.\n\nBut humans have only a few strains of the same species of gut bacteria, and these strains typically stay with each person for many years. So the pervasiveness of the newly discovered adaptation raises the question: How do DNA fragments become shared between individual humans?\n\n“Each person might have a couple of different strains of E. coli,” said Garud. “If fragments of DNA are transmitted horizontally across different strains in different hosts, and these strains seemingly are faithful to their respective hosts, where do they recombine? How do they move between individual people to become fixed in a whole population?”\n\nWhile the answer will emerge with future research, the discovery that gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, and the possibility that novel starches may be exerting strong evolutionary pressure on them, suggest that careful attention to what we eat could play a more varied role in promoting good health than we think.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.",

    "title": "Is Cognitive Dissonance Actually a Thing?",
    "description": "A foundational 1956 study of the concept, focussed on a U.F.O. doomsday cult, has been all but debunked by new research.",
    "fullText": "Festinger was developing the now ubiquitous theory of cognitive dissonance. He argued that, when people encounter contradictions, they experience so much discomfort that they feel an urgent need to reduce it. In response, a person can update his views—or he can misinterpret, and even reject, whatever information has challenged his beliefs. He might seek out people who agree with him; he might try to persuade those who don’t. “A man with a conviction is a hard man to change,” Festinger later wrote. “Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.” Cognitive dissonance helped explain human choices that otherwise seemed irrational, stubborn, and shortsighted: these were, in fact, attempts to reduce psychological distress.\n\nIn 1954, while Festinger was refining his theory, he stumbled upon a rare opportunity to observe the effects of dissonance. A newspaper reported that a small Chicago-area group, the Seekers, were receiving messages from aliens about an impending flood that would submerge North America. Festinger and two colleagues, plus several assistants, went undercover. In an influential 1956 book, “When Prophecy Fails,” the trio wrote that the Seekers committed to the prediction so fully that some quit their jobs while emptying their savings accounts. When no flood or aliens arrived, Festinger and his colleagues wrote, the Seekers tried to reduce the dissonance they were experiencing by recommitting to their belief and evangelizing—a seeming attempt to bring others into alignment with their views. “Their research resulted in convincing, if not definitive, confirmation of their hypotheses,” a reviewer from the American Sociological Review wrote. In 1957, Festinger published another book, “A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance,” which described laboratory studies of people acting to resolve dissonance.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how influential the theory is today. “You almost certainly can’t get through an introductory psychology class without hearing about cognitive dissonance,” Adam Mastroianni, writer of the psychology Substack “Experimental History,” told me. The phrase has been invoked to explain why environmentalists eat meat and why some Trump supporters play down the President’s connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Last month, on social media, memes making fun of Cynthia Erivo, the lead actress in the “Wicked” films, for rushing to protect Ariana Grande from a fan, spread on social media. The musician SZA said that we’d eventually look back on these posts and experience cognitive dissonance.\n\nLately, though, the foundational case study of the Seekers has been contending with its own kind of dissonance. Until this year, a box of Festinger’s documents—communications with colleagues, research notes, transcribed telephone conversations—in his archives at the Bentley Historical Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, remained sealed at the request of his widow, Trudy. When the files were released, a political scientist named Thomas Kelly discovered that the researchers, who were ostensibly neutral observers, actually wielded a profound level of influence over the Seekers. In a recent peer-reviewed paper, Kelly noted that there were at least five paid observers in addition to the three researchers; at some Seekers meetings, half of those present may have been infiltrators. One research assistant pretended to dream about a flood and receive psychic messages; one of Festinger’s co-authors, Henry Riecken, was revered by the group’s leaders. When the flood didn’t come, Riecken apparently encouraged the Seekers to double down on their beliefs, Kelly told me in November. “Here’s this canonical study, and it’s backwards,” Kelly said. “This is misleading people about the dynamics of new religions and social psychology.”\n\nJoel Cooper, a psychologist at Princeton, remembered reading the study when he was an undergraduate. He was so surprised that he missed his subway stop. “That was unimaginable to the field of psychology at the time,” Cooper said. The prevailing dogma was that people, like Pavlov’s dogs, responded based on rewards. In this instance, those who were rewarded more said they liked the task less.",

    "description": ": Apparently you’re about to get better advice on any identity issues lurking in your infrastructure",
    "fullText": "Cisco has decided its homegrown AI models are ready to power its products, starting with its Duo Identity Intelligence offering.\n\nThe model Cisco will use is called “Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct”. As described on the Hugging Face model-mart, it’s an open-weight, 8-billion-parameter instruction-tuned “Auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture,” namely Meta Llama-3.1-8B backbone.\n\nCisco tuned the model for cybersecurity applications and optimized it for three uses:\n\nIn a Tuesday post, Cisco revealed it’s using the model with Duo Identity Intelligence, a service that analyzes who logs on to networks, where they log on from, and which devices they use.\n\n“By examining post authentication signals, the system identifies patterns that traditional access controls often miss, including unusual geographic activity, abnormal privilege usage, and indications of MFA fatigue attempts or session hijacking,” Cisco explained.\n\nThe product alerts users to potential identity issues in a weekly email digest that Cisco will now compose with help from its new model.\n\n“Producing such a digest requires an artificial intelligence model that understands identity behavior, can interpret long chains of events, and communicates insights in a way that aligns with how security administrators make decisions,” Cisco’s post states, adding that general-purpose models “are not always tuned for the nuance and precision required for identity security and often introduce external dependencies.”\n\nUsing its own model, Cisco says, will deliver “summaries that are more accurate, more readable, and more aligned with real security workflows.”\n\nThe company also says the content of the digests will become “noticeably stronger … clearer and more consistent. Prioritization improves, making it easier to identify what demands immediate attention. Insights feel more relevant to each environment, and recommendations are expressed in a more actionable way.” Cisco reckons you’ll therefore end up using Identity Intelligence more often, because the model will produce info that demands action.\n\nThe improved digest is the result of collaboration between the teams that develop Duo and Cisco’s foundation models.\n\n“Both groups created a tuned prompt stack that significantly improved output quality and aligned the model with the analytical style expected in the digest,” Cisco’s post states.\n\nOver 2,000 Cisco customers receive the digest. If you’re one of them, let us know if the weekly email has improved!\n\nThe model can run on-prem or in the cloud, and do much more than write nice email digests. Cisco says its downstream uses include:\n\nIn early November, Cisco told The Register it’s working on a 17-billion parameter foundation model, and “a whole phalanx” of other AI. Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct seems to come from the phalanx, as while it is a foundation model it is nine billion parameters short of the forthcoming model Cisco mentioned.®",

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool. All right, Chad, we got to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.",

    "description": "Hidden deep under the floorboards of a small house, an excavation team uncovered four silver bracelets dating to the Viking Age, likely from the 9th century AD.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA farm in the mountains of Norway stands on the site of what was once a “large and powerful Viking farm” and has yielded a significant Viking treasure.\n\nHidden deep under the floorboards of a small house, an excavation team uncovered four silver bracelets dating to the Viking Age, likely from the 9th century AD.\n\nThe silver bracelets were found in what was likely the same place they were originally buried, offering more insight into to the origin story of the treasure.\n\nSilver was the Vikings’ treasure of choice. Their affinity for the metal gives discoveries of silver artifacts significant historical value—much like a treasure recently found in the mountains of Norway, one that had sat undisturbed since the 9th century AD.\n\nBefore farmer Tårn Sigve Schmidt was able to carve a new road for his tractor on his mountainous farm near Årdal, northwest of Oslo, he had to call in archaeologists to make sure there were no unique areas he was about to disturb. It’s a good thing he did.\n\nSeven inches beneath the floorboards of what was likely once a house for Viking slaves, a team of archaeologists found four heavy silver bracelets, all with different decorations, likely from over 1,100 years ago.\n\n“At first, I thought it was a question of some twisted copper wires that you can often find in agricultural land,” field archaeologist Ola Tengesdal Lygre said in a translated statement from the University of Stavanger, “but when I saw that there were several next to each other and that they were not copper at all, but silver, I realized that we had found something exciting.”\n\nFurther investigation showed that, at one point, a “large and powerful Viking farm” was located on the property, with multiple houses and shelter for animals. The location gave the owners control of the entry into the fjord. The excavation crew also found soapstone pots, rivets, knife blades, and whetstones for sharpening tools.\n\nBut nothing is quite as exciting as buried treasure.\n\n“This is definitely the biggest thing I have experienced in my career,” Volker Demuth, project manager at the Archaeological Museum at the University of Stavanger, said in a statement. “This is a unique find, because we very rarely find such objects exactly where they were placed. As a rule, such valuable objects are discovered on fields that have been plowed, where an object has been completely taken out of its original context. Since the silver hoard has not been moved, it can give us completely new insights into life and society in the Viking Age.”\n\nThe bracelets were transported within the block of soil they were found to the museum. X-rays were taken, and the team will test soil samples to help give a broader picture of the setting, including if the silver was wrapped in a cloth when it was buried. The bracelets are reminiscent of the necklaces found in Hjelmeland in 1769, and the archaeologists haven’t yet ruled out a connection between the two discoveries.\n\nExperts believe that the farm was the victim of arson at one point, likely coinciding with a period of unrest during the Viking Age in Norway, which stretched from from 800 AD to 1050 AD. The farm and the discovered silver were likely from the 9th century, archaeologists believe.\n\n“If people who lived on this farm had to flee from an attack,” Demuth said, “it would be natural to hide away the valuables you had before escaping to the mountains. And perhaps in a place where you would not have thought that a treasure was hidden.”\n\nThe research team hasn’t yet found anything \n\nWith no silver mines in Norway at the time of the stashing, any silver owned by the Vikings had to come from abroad, either through trade, as a gift, or even as loot from a raid. The Vikings traded in silver more than gold, likely a byproduct of the regions in which they traveled.\n\n“This is an absolutely fantastic find,” said Ole Madsen, the museum’s director, “which gives us completely unique knowledge about one of the most central eras in Norway, namely the Viking Age. We will exhibit this as soon as it is ready to be displayed.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.09% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be even higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the most recent cut to the federal funds rate, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October. The Fed is currently signaling a single rate cut for 2026, with perhaps one more in 2027.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been hovering in a range — but there has been a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, they remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing.

    "fullText": "Crypto markets were already on edge heading into President Donald Trump’s 9 PM EST primetime address to the nation from the White House.\n\nOnchain analysts spotted a large Ethereum move into Binance — the kind of transfer traders often associate with potential selling pressure, even when intentions are unclear.\n\nTrump said he would deliver “an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,” in a Truth Social post on Dec. 16.\n\nThe president did not specify a topic for the address, leaving markets to price in uncertainty ahead of the broadcast.\n\nFor crypto traders, high-profile political speeches can act like sudden volatility triggers, not necessarily because of direct crypto policy, but because they can shift expectations around the dollar, rates, risk appetite and market regulation.\n\nThat dynamic can lead some participants to cut leverage or reduce exposure ahead of time.\n\nOn Dec. 17, hours before Trump's 9 p.m. address to the nation, blockchain analytics account Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet “fully exited 10,169 $ETH ($29.7M)” and claimed:\n\n“Over the past 3 years, the whale has made a total profit of $11.36M trading $ETH.”\n\nThe post linked to Arkham Intelligence, where the address page shows a transfer of 10,169 ETH to a Binance deposit destination in recent activity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,014, up 1.8% in a day. Bitcoin was trading at $90,051, up 2.51% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLeaked memo shows popular crypto firm may wind down\n\nBitcoin, XRP slide as traders brace for key U.S. data\n\nAnalyst downgrades MicroStrategy amid higher dilution\n\nLarge holders - often called “crypto whales” - can influence liquidity and short-term price action simply by moving size, especially around major headline events.\n\nIn practice, traders tend to read whale deposits to exchanges as a potentially bearish signal (possible selling), while withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as more bullish (potential long-term holding).\n\nBut those signals can be noisy: whales also move funds for custody changes, collateral management, OTC settlement, or strategic rotation.\n\nWith Trump’s address set for 9 p.m. ET, traders will likely watch two things closely: whether more large wallets send crypto to exchanges in the hours before the speech, and whether derivatives markets show signs of rapid deleveraging.",

The record price for spot gold was trading at an intraday high of $4,380.99 an ounce Oct. 17, according to Kitco.com.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Dec. 11, the day I trekked out in the cold to get a few price quotes, the spot gold price was trading around $4,250 an ounce — up nearly 63% so far in 2025.\n\nOn Dec. 11, gold shot up to the highest point in more than a month, following the Federal Reserve's decision Dec. 10 to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Traders expect lower interest rates ahead, which can be bullish for gold prices.\n\nYet if you're thinking about taking advantage of high gold prices to get rid of some gold, maybe a broken chain for a locket or even a gold ring from a loved one, you shouldn't expect to receive the same amount of money everywhere you go.\n\nWhat different jewelers and pawn shops offer to pay a seller for old gold jewelry can vary substantially — even as much as 50% in one example I found recently.

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "House Republicans on Wednesday approved a narrow package designed to lower health care costs for some Americans in the coming years – marking a win for leadership even as some of their own members complain it falls woefully short of tackling rising prices in 2026.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson and his team were aggressive in pushing their health care plan to the floor this week, vowing it will be the first step of a major GOP agenda on lowering costs next year.\n\nThey are specifically ignoring, however, the issue of the expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies that were passed during the pandemic to help people afford premium costs. Those tax credits will expire at the end of the month, spiking premiums for tens of millions of Americans next year.\n\nThe House GOP package, instead, would allow small businesses — as well as self-employed people — to band together across industries to buy coverage through association health plans in an effort to lower premiums. It would also, once again, provide federal funding for the cost-sharing subsidies that lower-income Obamacare enrollees receive to reduce their deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for care.\n\nHouse Republicans would also require pharmacy benefit managers, which act as middlemen between drugmakers and insurers or employers, to provide employers with data on the price of drugs, the rebates they receive from manufacturers and other operations.\n\nThe House voted 216-211 to send the measure to the Senate, which is not expected to vote on it before lawmakers leave town for the holiday recess.\n\nThe last-minute health care push from GOP leaders comes at a fraught moment for the party: President Donald Trump is striving to show he is making progress to lower costs for everyday Americans. But his own members are attacking Johnson and other GOP leaders for ignoring the looming Obamacare subsidies cliff, which would raise costs for tens of millions of Americans starting in January.\n\nIf the enhanced subsidies lapse, enrollees will see their annual premium payments increase by 114% — or about $1,000 — on average in 2026, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Roughly 2 million more people are also expected to be uninsured next year if the subsidies end, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The more generous assistance was enacted in 2021 as part of a Biden administration Covid-19 relief package.\n\nA group of GOP centrists have been pressuring Johnson for months to reverse course on the subsidies — pushing bipartisan efforts to extend the subsidies while adding “guardrails” to ensure the dollars are not misused.\n\nBut Johnson has only dug in. Those centrists then decided Wednesday to openly defy Johnson and potentially issue him a humiliating defeat in January by signing onto a Democratic effort to extend the subsidies for three years. That plan from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is detested by most Republicans because it includes no reforms.\n\nBut centrists insist they had no other options to keep the money flowing in January – and prevent millions from losing coverage altogether – after party leaders repeatedly blocked their attempts to get a floor vote on the compromise proposals.",

The two ‍planes will be used for crew training and as a source of spare parts, officials said.\n\nSeveral published reports suggested the Air Force was buying the planes from Lufthansa, one of the ​few passenger airlines to have bought the 747-8 model, which was more popular ‌with cargo carriers before Boeing ended production in early 2023. A spokesperson for the German airline declined to comment.\n\nThe purchase is separate from two 747-8i aircraft that Boeing is currently modifying under the VC-25B program, which will serve as the next generation of Air Force One. The first of those heavily modified aircraft is expected to ⁠be delivered in mid-2028, the Air Force said.\n\nAn ​Air Force official, speaking on background, said the ​two training aircraft were also distinct from a 747-8i aircraft gifted to the United States by Qatar.\n\nThe Air Force One program has faced ‍delays and cost overruns ⁠since Boeing agreed to a $3.9 billion fixed-price contract in 2018 to deliver two modified 747-8s to replace the current fleet.\n\nThe Air Force said on Friday ⁠the delivery of the first of the two new Air Force One jets from Boeing had ‌been delayed by another year to mid-2028.",

    "fullText": "There may be more evidence in the murder of child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey. Her father, John, revealed more evidence has been uncovered to help solve the case.\n\nSix-year-old JonBenet was killed inside her Boulder, Colorado home on Christmas in 1996. Her body was discovered seven hours after she was reported missing. Her cause of death was strangulation, along with head trauma.\n\nDuring an interview on NewsNation’s Banfield, John said there has been “new evidence” that may finally help solve this case. He said, “Chief Redfern told us, gosh, I don’t know, September, we had a meeting with him, and that he had submitted evidence for additional DNA testing. He didn’t say what the evidence was, but that it was submitted again, or perhaps new.”\n\nAlthough John wasn’t clear on whether the evidence is new or had been previously tested, he called the development “encouraging.” He added that the authorities “have advocated that if certain evidence that was taken from the crime scene has never been sampled, that it ought to be the main one being the [unintelligible] that was used to strangle my daughter.”\n\nJohn admitted he wasn’t told specifics about the evidence, but has more confidence in the current leadership. “It was not very good for 25, 26 years, and Chief Redfern from the outside, I’ve met with him three or four times,” he said. “I’m impressed with him. I think he’s sincere and honest, and so I’m encouraged, and you know, we’ve advocated.”\n\nHe will inquire about the evidence, including whether the DNA was tested in the latest format necessary to do IGG, investigative genealogy. “And that would be very encouraging to us if they’ve done that,” John said. “This new technology, it’s been around for three or four years, is really, truly an investigative tool that allows police to investigate and look for the killer. The CODIS federal database of DNA has been around for 30 years. It’s, frankly, a little obsolete, in my opinion.”\n\nJohn, who says he’s more optimistic than he’s been in a long time, will request a January meeting for updates.\n\nTELL US – WILL THE KILLER BE CAUGHT?\n\nThe post JonBenet Ramsey’s Father Confirms Bombshell ‘Evidence’ in Murder appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "description": "The person in the photo was \"in proximity of\" the person of interest in the mass shooting at Brown University shooting, police said.",
    "fullText": "Providence police on Wednesday afternoon released an “enhanced” image of a person seen near the man identified as a person of interest in the shooting at Brown University on Saturday that killed two students and injured nine.\n\nTo date, it is the clearest image released by police in the ongoing manhunt for the person responsible for the mass shooting at the Ivy League university in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nIn the photo, the unidentified person is seen wearing a black jat, a hooded sweatshirt, a black hat and glasses. Police say the person in the photo was \"in proximity of the person of interest.\"\n\nAnyone who recognizes the person, or with information about the shooting, is urged to call the tip line at 401-272-3121.\n\nAs the manhunt for the gunman who took the lives of two students stretches into Wednesday, investigators say their highest priority is identifying a person of interest they’ve released numerous photos and videos of. Officials said during a Tuesday evening press conference that they believe this is the critical next step in charging someone in the shooting.\n\n“Once we identify who this person is, I believe we’ll be able to locate them,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.\n\nGunfire erupted on the first floor of Brown’s Barus and Holley engineering and physics building around 4 p.m. on Dec. 13 during an economics class. The shooting left sophomore Ella Cook and first-year student Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov dead and nine other students injured.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, one of the injured students was in critical condition, five more were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition, according to law enforcement and Brown University. Two have been released from Rhode Island Hospital.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have described the person of interest as being approximately 5-foot-8 inches tall with a “stocky build.” Photos and videos shared by police show what appears to be man dressed in dark clothing, including a beanie and face mask, walking down the street near Brown University approximately two hours before the shooting.\n\nOfficials have asked anyone associated with Brown or who lives or spends time around Providence to review the photos and videos of the person of interest. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the “identification, arrest and conviction of the individual.”\n\nProvidence Police Chief Col. Oscar L. Perez, Jr. advised the public to focus on the body movements of the person of interest shown in the videos during the press conference Tuesday evening.\n\n“You wanna focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry their weight,” he said.\n\nInvestigators said they are hoping to receive more footage of the person of interest from the public, as they speculate that he may have walked around the area surrounding Brown University as much as a week prior to the shooting.\n\n“We also know in this profession that many criminals will pace out an area weeks and days prior,” Perez explained.\n\nPolice share map of Brown University shooting person of interest’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting investigation spills over into Massachusetts\n\nInvestigators release video timeline of person of interest in Brown campus shooting’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting victim remembered for having a heart ‘as large as the sun’\n\nPolice now trying to ID person ‘in proximity of’ Brown University shooting person of interest",

    "description": "Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged Tricolor execs Daniel Chu and David Goodgame of scheming to defraud banks and private credit lenders.",
    "fullText": "Founder Daniel Chu and the company's Chief Operating Officer David Goodgame, who were arrested and charged with bank fraud and wire fraud on Wednesday, planned to frighten at least one lender into a favorable deal, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the executives discussed telling a lender that the company might otherwise implode, much like the energy trading firm Enron in 2001, if a deal wasn't reached. This would be bad for the lender because it would put them at risk of losing everything.\n\n\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said when discussing with other Tricolor executives how to deal with one particular lender who had figured out the double-pledging issue.\n\n\"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that. It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

    "title": "My kids already lead privileged lives, so I refuse to go all out at Christmas",
    "description": "I already have a full-time job. I have no intention of taking on the unpaid role of Christmas Fairy in my house.",
    "fullText": "Here's what you won't find in my house at Christmastime: Elf on the Shelf. December goody and craft boxes for the kids. Brand new matching Christmas pajamas. Holiday photo shoots. Forced Christmas card writing. Expensive tickets to line up at a crowded shopping center to see an overrated Santa.\n\nBefore you write me off as a Christmas Grinch who needs a visit from three ghosts in the middle of the night to reinvigorate my festive mojo, hear me out.\n\nNot going all out at Christmas is intentional for two reasons. Firstly, I don't want to be that frazzled mom who stretches herself in 20 different directions trying to create a magical Christmas for everyone, decorating the perfect house, and buying every gift on everyone's wish list.\n\nI already have a full-time job, and I have no intention of taking on the unpaid role of Christmas Fairy.\n\nSecondly, my kids already lead highly privileged lives. The only time they have known hunger is when there's a long line at McDonald's. My 6-year-old son's extracurricular activities include French and fencing lessons — and no, he doesn't attend a fancy private school; they are just some of the many before- and after-school activity options we're lucky to have at our school.\n\nMeanwhile, his 3-year-old brother's daycare has a chef who cooks him a hot, gourmet lunch every day. That certainly beats my microwaved canned soup.\n\nRather than spending excessive money on material things, we prefer to enrich our lives through travel. This year alone, we've taken family trips to the Seychelles, Finland, Australia, and Tenerife.\n\nIt's safe to say, then, that my kids live with abundance. We don't need the extra pressure to push that even further this month, just because we're told we're bad parents if we don't.\n\nI don't want December to be something that we dread and feel we have to get through, because we have created so many tasks that end up draining our energy, rather than use this period to reset before the New Year hits.\n\nI know my fellow moms are experiencing this because I hear about it all the time. Recent stats show that here in the UK, where we live, 62 percent of moms say they find Christmas \"fairly stressful,\" compared with 44 percent of dads, and 45 percent of women without children. I don't want to be one of those.\n\nThe other day, I overheard some moms at school pickup complaining about how much they had to do before Christmas, and how they were worried about running out of time. I felt like interrupting them to say, \"But do you really need to do all of it? Who said you had to do it all?\"\n\nBut before I could do that, they both came to the very wise conclusion that their New Year's resolution would be to commit to doing less. Instead of feeling guilty for my Grinch-like mindset, I felt like clapping out loud at their realization that many of our supposed Christmas commitments are self-imposed, and the world won't end if we say \"no\" to more things.\n\nI have also spoken to other moms who are planning to prioritize what they find meaningful over what the typical Christmas movie might portray.\n\nOne friend is even doing away with the traditional roast turkey dinner with all the trimmings and instead putting together a grazing table of everyone's favorite foods.\n\nAs for us, we're also skipping the British tradition of the Christmas pantomime show this year. Many families look forward to a TV celebrity taking on the main part of a fairy godmother or an ugly sister in a campy fairy tale performed onstage. But with tickets for a family of four coming to several hundred dollars, it's hard to justify the expense each year.\n\nI want my kids to grow up feeling that their lives are already full, and that they don't need certain things just because other people have them, or social media and TV said they should have them.\n\nThat doesn't mean we're not embracing Christmas in our own way, focusing on people rather than following trends and holiday traditions that we didn't ask to inherit.\n\nMy oldest recently went with his class to a local nursing home to sing Christmas carols to the residents. I can only imagine how happy they must have felt to see 30 6- and 7-year-olds belting out \"Jingle Bell Rock.\" My son was proud of his efforts, as was I, knowing that he had secretly learned the lesson of purpose over presents.\n\nSo, no, I don't feel the need to manufacture what others may define as a magical Christmas.\n\nThis is what would be magical for me: Taking a break from relentless work deadlines, calls, and emails. Not having to leave the house at 8:30 a.m. to get to school. Having movie days in our pajamas. Taking walks in the windswept woods. Eating party food for lunch just because we can. Doing what we want, not what society tells us we should do.\n\nIt seems that our boys are already getting the message. For example, we asked them if they wanted to visit a shopping center in Santa, which can cost between $10 and $50, where we live. I was prepared to suck up for the sake of Christmas if they really needed the experience. They both shook their heads and said they'd already seen Santa drive down our actual street. What could top that?\n\nThis lesson seems to be translating into real life outside of Christmas as well. My oldest will turn 7 at the end of January, which is always a challenge to find the enthusiasm for after the holiday season. We offered to throw him a mini golf and pizza party just like the one he recently attended. His answer was that he'd prefer to just go out for a burger with a few of his best friends.\n\nWhen kids realize that more isn't necessarily better, it's a life lesson that's hard to believe they've learned — and I'm convinced that keeping it real at Christmas is the key to that.",

    "description": "The Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, is in full production after trainings, live-fire exercises, and upgrades.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has a new air defense system built to transform light vehicles into mobile weapons for shooting down drones and other aircraft.\n\nThe technology is intended to equip Marines with a new way to deal with drones and other aerial threats, the service announced this week. As the war in Ukraine has shown, the ability to counter these types of threats is critical in modern conflict.\n\nThe new Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, entered full-rate production earlier this fall after training and live-fire exercises. Placed on top of a pair of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, MADIS converts the vehicles into a single short-ranged ground-based air defense system.\n\nThe vehicles work together, with one focused on countering drones and the other geared toward helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. MADIS uses Stinger missiles and a 30mm cannon for those targets, and it also comes with radars and electronic warfare systems. Marines can also use MADIS while on the move, giving the service a mobile air defense option.\n\nIt's a capability boost over the service's Man-Portable Air Defense System, or MANPAD, which Marines would've had to equip themselves and leave vehicles to use. MADIS is also capable of being upgraded over time, depending on what types of threats Marines are facing and what weapons they need for specific missions.\n\nMADIS, developed by the Norwegian firm Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, has undergone several iterations since its initial prototype. The Marine Corps said its full-rate production version has sensors, algorithms, and mobility that allow Marines to locate, target, and destroy threats faster and better than before. Its first live-fire exercise took place during joint US-Philippine military training earlier this year.\n\nMarine Corps officials have said MADIS fills a gap in their air defense arsenal and is unique because it can complete the entire kill chain. Marines can use it to find and identify targets and then take them out rather than relying on several systems to do the same.\n\nMADIS also addresses Marine Corps concerns around how to defeat small uncrewed aerial systems in a potential future war.\n\nSince MADIS is mobile, it gives Marines a new way to defend forward-deployed forces — especially in a potential future fight against a sophisticated adversary like China.\n\nAs the Marine Corps reshapes its force for operations across the first island chain, from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines, it needs systems that can move quickly and deliver more firepower against a wide range of aerial threats.",

    "description": "An update on Oracle's data center plans was the latest development giving investors anxiety about the health of the AI trade on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Another day, another update that's giving investors anxiety about the AI trade.\n\nThe US tech sector was under pressure on Wednesday as traders took in a report from The Financial Times that said Blue Owl Capital wouldn't back a $10 billion data center the company was planning to build in Michigan for OpenAI.\n\nOracle shares led the broader market lower, falling as much as 6% Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly around 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the market:\n\nThe latest developments extend a broader rotation out of the market's most expensive tech stocks and into other parts of the market.\n\nThe enthusiasm for AI has dampened particularly in the past week, Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Additionally, rotation pressure out of tech has accelerated, with positioning data showing rising demand for smaller-cap and value stocks,\" Turnquist said of the latest market moves.\n\nThe FT's report said that talks between Oracle and Blue Owl Capital stalled over the planned data center. The private credit firm will not move forward with funding the project due to concerns about Oracle's hefty AI spending and growing debts, sources told the outlet.\n\nOracle disputed the contents of the FT report.\n\n\"The FT story is incorrect. Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl. Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,\" Michael Egbert, a spokesperson for Oracle, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for the AI trade, but particularly for Oracle. After impressing investors with an aggressive revenue forecast, the stock has declined steadily in the last two months as the company stokes more concerns about the large amounts of debt coursing through the AI space. Shares are down 45% from their peak in early September.\n\nOracle recently triggered another sell-off in tech after reporting lower-than-expected earnings and pledging to increase its capital expenditures more than expected in the coming year.\n\nCoreWeave is the other prominent tech name to join Oracle recently as a poster child of investors' growing anxieties about the health of the AI trade. Similar to Oracle, CoreWeave has spooked investors with its high debt load and reliance on a handful of customers. As of Wednesday afternoon, the stock is down 66% from its post-IPO high reached in June.",

    "fullText": "Hollywood's latest clash of the titans: Netflix versus Paramount.\n\nThe two companies are battling to buy Warner Bros. Discovery (or, in Netflix's case, just its streaming and studios assets).\n\nThe fight pits Paramount's David Ellison, backed by his father Larry's billions, against entertainment's reigning champion of paid streaming.\n\nWBD accepted Netflix's bid, but it's far from over, as Paramount went hostile last week with its own $108 billion offer. The WBD board on Wednesday recommended that shareholders reject that hostile offer. Now, it's Ellison's move. Will he sweeten his bid?\n\nThere are many facets to this story — and why it's happening now — ranging from politics and antitrust to the rise of the creator economy.\n\nBusiness Insider's chief media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, and deputy media editor Nathan McAlone will answer the key questions about the deal and its implications, live on Thursday at 1:30 p.m. ET.\n\nEmail your questions to Nathan McAlone.",

    "fullText": "The executive who led Amazon's efforts to build top AI models is out.\n\nRohit Prasad, SVP and head scientist, is leaving two years after launching a new Artificial General Intelligence group.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said Prasad plans to depart at the end of the year. Prasad was elevated to report directly to Jassy in 2023 to lead the AGI team, which was tasked with developing Amazon's \"most ambitious\" AI models, Business Insider reported at the time.\n\nSince then, Prasad helped launch Amazon's Nova family of AI models. Although Nova models earned some praise for their efficiency, they still trail frontier models such as OpenAI's GPT offerings, Anthropic's Claude Opus, and Google's Gemini.\n\nAs part of the shake-up, Amazon is creating a new organization under Peter DeSantis, AWS's SVP of Utility Computing, Jassy said. The group will oversee Amazon's AGI and AI model initiatives as well as its silicon chip and quantum computing efforts.\n\nJassy also said that Pieter Abbeel, the co-founder of robotics startup Covariant, who joined Amazon last year, will now lead the company's frontier AI model research team.\n\nPrasad's departure is the latest in a series of leadership changes at AWS. Over the past year, the company has seen several executives depart, including VP of AI Matt Wood and VP of generative AI Vasi Philomin, while bringing in new talent such as former Microsoft executive Julia White as chief marketing officer.\n\nAWS also recently hired David Richardson as VP of AgentCore and Joe Hellerstein as Vice President and Distinguished Scientist, and added Chet Kapoor as VP of security services and observability.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Christmas celebrations at the White House date back to 1800, but Hanukkah wasn't acknowledged until much later.",
    "fullText": "The White House hasn't always marked the Festival of Lights with menorah lightings and musical performances.\n\nOfficial Christmas celebrations date back to the 1800s, but celebrating Hanukkah at the White House is a fairly recent development in US history.\n\nPresident John Adams hosted the first White House Christmas party in 1800, and President Calvin Coolidge held the first National Christmas Tree lighting in 1923. Jacqueline Kennedy began the tradition of choosing a theme for the White House Christmas decorations in 1961.\n\nStill, the first official White House Hanukkah reception wasn't held until 2001.\n\nTake a look at the fascinating history of how the White House Hanukkah party came to be.\n\nThe menorah lighting was held on the Ellipse, a lawn south of the White House.\n\nThe secretary of the interior under Carter initially refused to issue a permit for a menorah on the White House lawn, citing the First Amendment, The Washington Post reported. But Stu Eizenstat, one of Carter's advisors, argued that the National Christmas Tree's permit should also be denied on the same grounds, and the event was allowed to proceed.\n\nSince then, every US president has marked Hanukkah in one way or another.\n\nReagan maintained contact with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement, throughout his presidency, even declaring his 80th birthday a National Day of Reflection, according to Chabad.org.\n\nBush invited children to light Hanukkah candles and play dreidel at the Old Executive Building, which sits adjacent to the White House.\n\nChildren from local schools and synagogues were welcomed into the Oval Office to light the menorah and play dreidel with Clinton.\n\nMaking the White House kitchen kosher involves Saran Wrap, tin foil, and vats of boiling water to cover and purify non-kosher surfaces. The chefs use only certified kosher ingredients.\n\nMatt Nosanchuk served as the White House's associate director of public engagement and liaison to the American Jewish community during Obama's second term. He told Business Insider that there used to be separate tables for kosher and non-kosher food at Bush's Hanukkah parties, but one year, the labels were accidentally switched.\n\nRabbi Levi Shemtov, a Chabad rabbi in Washington, DC, who worked closely with the White House staff to prepare kosher food, suggested making the entire reception kosher to avoid confusion in the future, Nosanchuk said.\n\n\"Apparently, President Bush said, 'Do whatever you need to do, it's fine,' and Rabbi Shemtov was like, 'Well, you're going to have to stay out of the kitchen for 24 hours before the party,'\" Nosanchuk said.\n\nThe Kol Zimra a cappella choir performed at a menorah lighting ceremony before the White House Hanukkah reception in 2004.\n\nThe two identical receptions were hosted on the same day, so that the White House kitchen only has to be made kosher once.\n\n\"Given how crowded the previous parties had become, they decided to have two,\" Nosanchuk said.\n\nIn 2013, then-10-year-old Asher Weintraub invented a \"menurkey,\" a menorah shaped like a turkey. He raised over $48,000 on Kickstarter to produce and sell them.\n\n\"Of course, I said we gotta invite this kid to the White House Hanukkah party,\" Nosanchuk said. \"We didn't use the menurkey onstage, but we made sure the kid was up front on the rope line so that he could say hello to President Obama and present him with a menurkey. And President Obama loved the menurkey.\"\n\nMike Boxer performed with the Jewish a cappella group Six13 at the White House Hanukkah reception in 2016. He told Business Insider the performers usually sing in the foyer outside the party for about an hour, welcoming guests as they enter, and then have a private audience with the president and first lady.\n\nBefore meeting the Obamas, Boxer and his group were told to prepare 45 seconds of a song to perform for them. They chose a snippet from \"A Hamilton Chanukah,\" a medley of songs from the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" rewritten with Hanukkah-themed lyrics.\n\nBoxer said that their private concert featured some unexpected guests.\n\n\"We look over, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor are peering through the door,\" he said. \"Barack Obama goes, 'Come in, come in.' One of them said, 'I love this stuff.'\"\n\nIn his public engagement role at the White House, Nosanchuk was responsible for the guest list of the Hanukkah reception. Every year, the list was built from scratch to include as many new people as possible.\n\n\"I went out of my way to invite people who had never been before, who had done interesting and important and valuable work in the Jewish community or in their broader community,\" he said. \"There were a wide array of constituencies and groups and individuals who we wanted to engage with and touch during these holiday receptions. The Hanukkah receptions were a subset of that larger group.\"\n\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter, is Jewish. She converted before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2017 that Trump broke with tradition by excluding Democratic lawmakers from the guest list of what had previously been a bipartisan event.\n\nThen-chief of staff to first lady Melania Trump, Stephanie Grisham, told Business Insider in a statement that masks would be required and provided at the events, hand-sanitizing stations would be set up, chefs would serve food from behind plexiglass barriers, and that the guest lists were \"smaller.\" She did not respond to Business Insider's questions about the exact number of invited guests.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that Trump attended only the evening Hanukkah reception, where he falsely claimed that with the help of \"certain very important people, if they have wisdom and if they have courage, we are going to win this election.\" Joe Biden had already been declared the winner the previous month.\n\nThree days after the party, vice chairman of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee Tom Mountain was hospitalized with COVID-19, which he attributed to his attendance at the event.\n\n\"Let's put it this way: When I went down to Washington, DC, for the White House Hanukkah event, I was perfectly fine,\" Mountain told NBC affiliate WJAR. \"And three days later after that event, I was in the hospital … ready to be put on a lifesaving ventilator.\"\n\n\"To think that today, I'm here before you as the first Jewish spouse of an American president or vice president celebrating Hanukkah, in the people's house, it's humbling, and it's not lost on me that I stand before you all on behalf of all the Jewish families and communities out there across our country,\" Emhoff said. \"I understand that, and I really appreciate it.\"\n\nThe Jewish Telegraphic Agency's Ron Kampeas reported that invitations to the in-person White House Hanukkah party on December 1 were sent out a week before the event, and that holiday plans took shape relatively last-minute due to COVID-19 concerns surrounding in-person events.\n\nLocated in the Cross Hall, the menorah was built by White House carpenters using leftover wood from a Truman-era White House renovation.\n\nIn addition to the regular White House Hanukkah gathering on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff hosted the first-ever Hanukkah party at the vice president's residence.\n\n\"As president of the United States, I will always support Jewish Americans,\" Trump said during the celebration, \"and I will always be a friend and a champion of the Jewish people.\"\n\nThe National Menorah is now a 30-foot-tall structure that requires a lift from a cherry picker to light.\n\nThis year's National Menorah Lighting, broadcast on C-SPAN, took place on December 14.",

    "description": "YouTube announced that it has secured the global rights to Hollywood's biggest night, a major victory in the fight over live events.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's biggest night is going to a streamer.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Wednesday that YouTube will hold the global rights to the Oscars from 2029 through 2033.\n\nWhile that means they'll no longer be on ABC starting in 2029, ending a more than 50-year run of consecutive broadcasts on the television network, the Oscars will continue to be available for free worldwide — just on YouTube and YouTube TV. As part of the partnership, red carpet coverage and other behind-the-scenes content from before the award show is also included.\n\nThe news comes as streamers like YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, and others, increasingly compete over live events to host on their respective platforms. Historically, the Oscars are one of the most-watched nights of TV, and in non-presidential election years, it is often the only non-sporting event to chart within the top 100 most-watched telecasts of the year.\n\n\"The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,\" YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. \"Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy.\"\n\nDisney and ABC will continue to hold the rights to the Oscars through 2028, including the milestone 100th Academy Awards.\n\nOutside of the Oscars, the Google Arts & Culture initiative will provide digital access to select Academy Museum exhibitions and programs, the academy said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement was also struck at a time when YouTube has evolved beyond a place people post and watch short clips and amateur videos on mobile and desktop to become a fixture in the living room. The monthly Nielsen Gauge shows YouTube grabbing the top spot in share of TV viewing among media companies for months running, with a 12.9% share in October, ahead of Disney (11.4%) and NBCUniversal (8.6%).\n\nThe nature of what people are watching has also changed. The streaming data analysis company Digital i found that videos lasting 30 minutes or more accounted for 73% of total viewing on YouTube in the US in October 2024, up 8% from a year earlier.\n\nYouTube has encouraged this shift, rolling out new tools for creators to incentivize them to make serialized shows that look like what you think of as traditional TV.\n\nYouTube's living room-domination plans loomed in the background of its recent highly public dispute with Disney over how much it should pay the media company to carry its channels like ESPN and ABC News on YouTube TV. Google recently shared numbers showing YouTube TV was the No. 4 pay-TV service in the US.\n\nTraditional media companies have tried to combat YouTube's expansion by taking a page from the platform and striking deals with YouTube video creators and podcasters.",

    "description": "At a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters, Musk discussed the company's future, its finances, and data centers in space.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk appears to be feeling upbeat about the future of his AI company.\n\nAt a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters last week, Musk told staff that if the company could survive the next two to three years, xAI would triumph over its competitors, several sources with knowledge of the meeting said.\n\nThe xAI CEO said that the company's ability to rapidly scale its power and data capacity would be a key ingredient in the race to achieve superintelligence — which surpasses human intelligence — and become the most powerful AI company.\n\nMusk said that xAI could achieve artificial general intelligence, which matches or exceeds human intelligence, in the next few years, even as soon as 2026, sources said.\n\nMusk said in November that xAI had a 10% likelihood of achieving AGI with its Grok 5 model, which he has said the company plans to release early next year.\n\nThe CEO also told staff that xAI would have an advantage over other AI companies because it would have access to around $20 billion to $30 billion in funding per year, and it could benefit from its proximity to his other companies, sources said. Tesla integrated Grok into its vehicles earlier this year.\n\nOverall, workers said Musk appeared happy with the company's progress. One insider described the meeting as \"peppy.\"\n\nMusk also theorized about building data centers in space and his plans to colonize Mars, the sources said. He said that Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot could eventually man such extraterrestrial data centers, the people said.\n\nMusk has previously said that Optimus could provide support for SpaceX missions as soon as next year. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have publicly talked about the possibility of building data centers in space, though Pichai acknowledged that it is a \"moonshot.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for a comment, the company responded with an automated message: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nOver the past year, xAI has rapidly expanded the footprint of its data centers, a project it has named Colossus. Earlier this year, the company said it had around 200,000 GPUs, and Musk has said it plans to expand to 1 million GPUs.\n\nxAI is one of many companies racing to build AGI and justify valuations worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite Musk's outsize profile, xAI is still a relatively new player in a race dominated by giants like OpenAI and Google.\n\nThe AI race shows no signs of slowing down. Earlier this month, OpenAI entered a state of emergency as it raced to push out its latest model, according to reports. Google released a new Gemini model in November, and xAI has pushed new versions of Grok in rapid succession.\n\nDuring the all-hands, xAI leads demonstrated several updates to existing products, such as Grok Voice, the company's app for Tesla owners, and its agents, sources said. Some of the updates included improvements to Grok's ability to predict outcomes, better listening functions for Grok voice, and video editing, the people said.\n\nDo you work at xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "Moving the Oscars from ABC to the internet is hugely symbolic. That doesn't mean that a huge audience will follow.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood may be embattled. But it's still capable of putting out a compelling narrative: On Wednesday morning, news broke that Netflix has won (for now) the right to buy Warner Bros. studio and HBO.\n\nA few hours later, news broke that YouTube is going to be the new host of the Oscars.\n\nEven the dullest of us can understand this storyline: In a single day, three of old media's most treasured assets have been acquired by digital usurpers — internet services that used to be dismissed by media giants, and are now giants themselves.\n\nIf Netflix does end up walking away with most of Warner Bros., that's a big, structural change. A purely digital outlet will control a movie studio that (still) puts movies into movie theaters, as well as the most prestigious premium TV service.\n\nAnd while I'm still processing this one, I think moving the Oscars from ABC — in 2029, when the five-year deal kicks in — is going to be more symbolic than tectonic. That is: If you are someone who liked watching the Oscars on ABC, you'll just watch it on YouTube.\n\nIt's possible that YouTube version of the Oscars could look and feel radically different. But I doubt it, because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — the people who actually run the Oscars and produce the show — will still be running the Oscars and producing the show. And my hunch is YouTube has already promised the Academy that the 2029 Oscars will look and feel just like the 2026 Oscars.\n\nWhich brings us to the next question: Will moving the Oscars from a TV channel to an internet service bring any more eyeballs to the Oscars? Because right now, the Oscars seem like a product in permanent decline: In 1998, when \"Titanic\" was a megahit and most people treated the internet as a novelty, viewership peaked at 57 million US viewers. It has been steadily eroding since then, and now brings in less than half of that — which means Hollywood's biggest night brings in considerably fewer eyeballs than an average NFL game.\n\nEvery year, there is lots of hand-wringing and debate about why that's the case: Moviegoing itself is in decline; the awards often feature movies that people who do go to movies have never heard of; the show itself isn't nearly as interesting as it could be.\n\nBut there really shouldn't be any debate at all: TV is less popular because of the internet. So everything on TV — with the sole exception of the NFL — is less popular.\n\nSo while moving the Oscars from a broadcast TV network to the internet, and making the Oscars available worldwide, for free, will certainly increase the potential audience, I'm not sure that many more people will find it compelling.\n\nYes, it's cool to see stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet — the two leading contenders for the 2026 Best Actor award — sitting in the Dolby Theatre. But even if that happens, there's a very good chance that you won't have seen the movies they've been nominated for. So whether the show is on TV or an app, are you going to tune in — especially when you can already see Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet on Instagram and TikTok, 24/7?\n\nIf the Academy wants bigger audiences, YouTube is a fine place to look. They just might not like what they find.",

    "title": "The 6 biggest reveals from WBD's filing on why it rejected Paramount",
    "description": "A new filing says Paramount offered pay and a job to WBD CEO David Zaslav, and gives other takeaways from the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery didn't just reject Paramount again on Wednesday. It also pulled back the curtain on what the bidding war was like behind the scenes.\n\nWBD advised shareholders to dismiss Paramount's $30-per-share offer for the company and stick with Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share (for only its studios and streaming business). In a filing, WBD's board called Paramount's latest bid inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on shareholders compared to Netflix's bid, which it said offered superior value and more certainty.\n\nSome of the information in the filing had already been made public, but it revealed some juicy bits that haven't been reported.\n\nHere are the top six takeaways:\n\nRight after WBD rejected one of multiple secret bids in September, David Ellison called Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to request that Zaslav meet with his father, Larry Ellison. The conventional wisdom was that the Oracle cofounder's billions would prevail. In the end, that didn't happen. WBD expressed concern that the bid relied on a revocable trust, whose assets or liabilities were subject to change.\n\nWe already knew Zaslav stood to make over $500 million from a Paramount deal, based mainly on his shares that would vest immediately after it closed ($567,712,631, to be exact, according to the filing). Zaslav told the WBD board that the Ellisons had \"indicated to him that\" if a deal went through, he would \"receive a compensation package worth several hundred million dollars,\" per the filing. Zaslav responded that it \"would be inappropriate to discuss any such arrangements at that time,\" he told the board.\n\nParamount also offered Zaslav the position of co-CEO and co-chairman of the combined company, a role Netflix didn't offer, the filing said.\n\nThat runs contrary to the narrative put forth in a letter Paramount's attorneys at Quinn Emanuel sent to WBD, stating they suspected the process was biased in favor of Netflix due to WBD leadership's expectations that there could be roles for them at the new company. Paramount's legal and financial advisors didn't know about the \"December 3 Quinn Emanuel\" letter and, in their view, the letter should not have been sent, was \"not helpful,\" and was a \"mistake,\" the filing says.\n\nThe filing revealed the presence of a fourth, previously unknown bidder in the process, \"Company C,\" which proposed acquiring WBD's cable channels and 20% of its streaming and studio businesses for $25 billion in cash.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Company C was Starz. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm that. Starz declined to comment.\n\nWBD determined that the Company C bid was \"not actionable\" and continued to work with Netflix, Paramount, and \"Company A\" (clearly Comcast).\n\nSome of Wall Street's marquee names — Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan, and Evercore — are set to make a total of $225 million in connection with WBD's sale to Netflix or Paramount, if a deal goes through, according to the filing.\n\nThe good times are poised to continue: Media and telecoms M&A deal value rose 61% in the past year, excluding the announced WBD sale, and the momentum should keep going in the years ahead, helped by investor appetite for valuable IP, according to PwC.\n\nThe Ellisons wanted to use $24 billion from Middle Eastern sources to fund their bid. That would seem to raise a whole host of concerns, not the least of which is that they'd be buying CNN and some of that money would come from Saudi Arabia's government, which US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018.\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka noted, however, that the issues WBD says the foreign money raised were \"presented as technical hurdles\" in the filing and \"not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\"\n\nA big question around the dueling bids was which company would have a better chance of surviving regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBoth Paramount and Netflix made their cases, arguing that they'd sail through the process, while the other bidder would encounter issues.\n\nParamount said a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the well-stocked Warner Bros. library. Netflix, for its part, has argued that a combination of Paramount and WBD would actually be larger than its own proposed new entity, as measured by total US TV viewing time.\n\nNone of this seemed to be a chief concern for the WBD board, though.\n\n\"The WBD Board further took into account advice of WBD's regulatory advisors that regulatory risk was not a material differentiating factor between\" the Paramount and Netflix proposals, the filing said.\n\nThe wild card is Trump, though, who has close ties to the Ellisons but hasn't come down firmly on either side publicly.",

    "description": "LinkedIn's 'Year in Review' taught me I spend way too much time there. Here's how to find yours and what you'll see.",
    "fullText": "Curious just how much time you're spending on LinkedIn?\n\nWell, now you can find out how many days out of the 365-day calendar year you're logging in — among other stats — from LinkedIn's \"Year in Review\" feature.\n\nMicrosoft-owned LinkedIn is one of many platforms following in Spotify's footsteps with a personalized end-of-year recap of users' data. This year, several companies joined in on the Spotify Wrapped fun, including YouTube and Uber Eats (shortly following an SNL spoof).\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago, I wrote a wish list of what other apps I wanted \"wrapped.\" LinkedIn was one of them.\n\nThank you for fulfilling my data-hungry dreams, Microsoft!\n\n(TikTok, Instagram, and dating apps, there's still time to deliver us with more wrapped experiences.)\n\n\"Year in Review gives members a new way to reflect on how they learned, connected, and grew in 2025,\" LinkedIn editor in chief Dan Roth said in a statement. \"It's a fun way to look back on the year and celebrate milestones like new jobs, skills, and moments of professional growth.\"\n\nOpen LinkedIn, and at the top of the homepage on the LinkedIn mobile app, you should see a pop-up inviting you to view your \"Year in Review.\"\n\nIf not, head over to your notifications tab, where there should be another reminder to \"look back at your 2025 on LinkedIn.\" Or search directly for the feature in the app's search bar.\n\nThe feature summarizes data points in several slides, including the year you joined LinkedIn, how frequently you use the platform, any job changes, and your LinkedIn engagement and performance metrics throughout the year.\n\nI do think the team missed a golden naming opportunity, however, to name the recap feature your \"LinkedIn Annual Performance Review.\"\n\nI'd also like to know who my top profile viewers were. C'mon, we know you can do it.\n\nI spent 281 days on LinkedIn, according to my own LinkedIn recap.\n\nThat's about 77% of the calendar year. And that definitely includes several weekends.\n\nThe feature also takes you down a memory lane of LinkedIn connections, reminding you of when you joined the professional networking platform and who your first connection was. (I joined in 2017, and my first connection was a peer from college.)\n\nMeanwhile, my connections are scoring hot jobs in AI. LinkedIn told me that 588 of my connections \"were on the move\" and landed at companies like OpenAI, Stealth Startup, and Stealth AI Startup. As a reporter covering tech, that's … not surprising given the heated talent wars happening in AI and the cacophony of new AI startups launching.\n\nIf you wanted an ego boost (or buzzkill), LinkedIn also recaps some of your engagement metrics, such as new followers, comments, reactions, and profile views (if you pay for LinkedIn Premium).\n\nPremium users also get to see their top searches and most-used premium features.\n\nThe cheekier features include a title summarizing what \"you embodied\" on LinkedIn. For me — and at least three other Business Insider peers of mine — it was a \"catalyst.\" This, according to LinkedIn, means that \"you put your ideas out there and got people talking, sparking fresh perspectives.\"\n\nLinkedInfluencer career, here I come.",

    "fullText": "Howard \"Howie\" Rubin, a once-prominent Salomon Brothers investment banker featured in the 1985 Wall Street expose \"Liar's Poker,\" must remain in a federal jail in Brooklyn indefinitely as he fights sex-trafficking charges, a judge ruled on Wednesday.\n\nIt was the third bail denial for Rubin, accused of paying women, many of them former Playboy models, $5,000 to engage in \"fetish play,\" then constraining and torturing them, including by electrocuting them against their will.\n\nMagistrate Judge Peggy Kuo said her main concern is the risk that the wealthy financier, who has a $70 million account based in the Cayman Islands, would flee the country.\n\n\"The thing that is troubling me is I don't know if I can trust Mr. Rubin,\" Kuo said in denying bail. She said she has no way of knowing for certain if Rubin is mulling, \"What does my life look like if I flee, and what does it look like if I stay?\"\n\nRubin's 10-count indictment alleges a series of attacks against 10 Jane Does between 2009 and 2019 in luxury hotels and a soundproofed bedroom \"sex dungeon\" at his Manhattan penthouse apartment.\n\nRubin, 70, of Fairfield, Connecticut, pleaded not guilty and has been held without bail since his arrest in September. Rubin was once considered one of Wall Street's most skilled and aggressive traders of complex mortgage securities, earning him roles at influential firms like Merrill Lynch and Soros Fund Management.\n\nIn his latest bid for freedom, his lawyers had offered a $70 million bond, co-signed by family members. They include his wife, who has been divorcing him since 2021, and who wrote a letter to the judge extolling his devotion to three young grandchildren, who call him \"Pops.\"\n\n\"There is no allegation that Mr. Rubin engaged in any BDSM activity since 2019,\" his lawyers wrote in bail arguments filed Tuesday. \"He has been living in Connecticut for years, devoted to the care of his grandchildren,\" they wrote.\n\nFederal prosecutors countered that no amount of bail or electronic monitoring could guarantee Rubin's return to court; they also say that he has used threats and coercion to silence his accusers, allegations Rubin denies.\n\nRubin's former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, has been charged with pocketing millions of dollars to arrange the encounters; she has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges and is free on $850,000 bail.\n\nHer husband, Stephen Powers, is free on $250,000, according to court records. Both Powers have pleaded not guilty to bank and tax fraud in connection with the encounters.\n\nThree attorneys for Rubin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nRubin is due back in court on January 15. If convicted of the top sex trafficking charge, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and as much as life in prison.",

    "description": "\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer told Business Insider. The deal would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, he said.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is the prospective tenant that withdrew funding from Fermi America's massive data-center project, sending the developer's stock plummeting earlier this month, Business Insider has learned.\n\nIn September, Fermi, which is developing an 11-gigawatt data-center campus in the Texas Panhandle, said it had agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with an investment-grade tenant to anchor the project. The tenant would take the first gigawatt of power across 12 facilities.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, Fermi's stock plunged by nearly half after a securities filing said an unnamed prospective partner had canceled a $150 million advance to begin construction, known as an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, or AICA. The cancellation followed the end of an exclusivity period.\n\nAmazon is that tenant, Toby Neugebauer, Fermi's billionaire CEO, confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider, discussing the talks that led to the cancellation. The tech giant has been negotiating the deal, which would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, Neugebauer said.\n\n\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Neugebauer said.\n\nNeugebauer said the talks between Fermi and the tenant remain constructive, and that the ending of the AICA didn't indicate any breakdown in conversation.\n\n\"It's just a normal negotiation,\" he said. \"Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.\"\n\nNeugebauer said he wasn't worried about the talks taking too long. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"Big deals take longer.\"\n\nLisa Levandowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nFermi America's Panhandle project ranks among the most ambitious attempts yet to meet the surging energy demands of the data centers fueling the AI boom. The company intends to bring 11 gigawatts of new power online over the next decade-plus with a mix of power from the grid, natural gas, and nuclear sources.\n\nThe company went public in September, pricing its shares at $21 to raise more than $680 million.\n\nDubbed Project Matador, the development relies on a 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System. That agreement is dependent on a signed letter of intent between Fermi America and a tenant.\n\nThe December 12 filing said that none of the $150 million construction advance had been used and that the negotiations were ongoing. The letter of intent remains in force.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note published December 12 that they had spoken to Fermi America's management and learned that, per the company, the anchor tenant \"tried to make last-minute changes to the agreement pricing that were unacceptable to\" Fermi.\n\nAmazon is the second company to be linked to the project. In October, Neugebauer told the Amarillo City Council that Palantir, the software company known for its police and government contracts, had taken an interest in the site.\n\n\"I just finished with Palantir, which is our nation's tip of the spear in the AI war,\" Neugebauer said during the October 28 meeting. \"They'll be here Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said in their note that management indicated that they were \"active\" with two additional tenants, and in dialogue with another four.\n\nFermi America was founded less than a year ago by Neugebauer, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Perry's son Griffin. The IPO valued the company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nA recent slump in the company's shares has brought its valuation to below $6 billion.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "PayPal impersonators are at it again.",
    "fullText": "Another PayPal phishing scam is circulating, this time with email notifications about recurring or automatic payments. The messages originate from a legitimate PayPal address, allowing them to evade some security filters and leave recipients worried that their accounts have been compromised—perhaps just enough to ignore the obvious red flags and call or email scammers back.\n\nI personally have been targeted by this scam with at least five separate emails, though all have gone straight to my spam folder. Here's how scammers are exploiting PayPal settings to land in your inbox.\n\nIf you're targeted by this campaign, you may receive an email with the subject line \"Your automatic payment status has changed\" or \"Recurring Payment Reactivated.\" The layout imitates a real PayPal notification and includes a message about a high-dollar payment being \"successfully processed\" along with a customer service email and phone number to contact PayPal support.\n\nThe email is full of red flags: It is addressed to a random name (or, in one of the messages I received, \"Hello Update Invoice\"), has poor spelling and wonky formatting, and simply doesn't make sense. You can easily spot oddities like bold text and Unicode characters, which BleepingComputer notes is a trick used to bypass spam filters and keyword detection.\n\nWhere the trick lies is in the sender field, as the email comes from service[at]paypal[dot]com, a legitimate PayPal address, and paypal.com is in the signed-by field. As Malwarebytes Labs describes, this is likely an abuse of PayPal's subscription billing feature. If a merchant pauses a customer subscription, the user will receive an automatic email from PayPal notifying them that their payment is no longer active. Scammers are likely setting up fake subscriber accounts using Google Workspace mailing lists, so automatic emails being generated are sent to everyone on those lists. If you look at the \"To:\" field, you'll see that the message isn't actually addressed to your email.\n\nExploiting these types of loopholes to make phishing emails seem legit is a common tactic, and I've covered several similar PayPal phishing campaigns already this year. According to a statement provided to BleepingComputer, PayPal is working on mitigating this specific flaw.\n\nIf one of these PayPal messages lands in your inbox, don't engage with it. Scammers frequently use emails, texts, and calls about account security and financial transactions to scare you into action, and the impersonation of trusted institutions is often pretty convincing.\n\nIf you are concerned about activity on your PayPal account, go directly to the app or website and log in to view alerts and check transactions. Do not use contact information or click any links in the original notification, as this increases the chances of compromising your information or downloading malware to your device.",

    "title": "Apple Just Changed the Way You AirDrop With Strangers",
    "description": "AirDrop codes makes things a bit more secure and convenient.",
    "fullText": "AirDrop is one of Apple's best features. I use it on a daily basis to share files between my various Apple devices, but it really shines when I'm sharing stuff with other people, or vice versa. It can be tricky to find a quick solution to send larger files. Emails have too low a file size limit, chat apps can compress files, and cloud storage can fill up fast, but AirDrop is simple, built-in, and reliable. It even works with Android now, albeit just the Pixel 10.\n\nIf AirDrop has one flaw, it's that it's not particularly easy to use with strangers. Apple has changed how this side of AirDrop works over the years. For the longest time, you had two AirDrop settings: \"Contacts Only,\" which only lets your saved contacts find your device for AirDropping files, and \"Everyone,\" which leaves your AirDrop open to anyone with an iPhone to send you stuff. This was convenient when you needed to share files with strangers, but inconvenient if you left it on: Anyone with an iPhone could see your iPhone and send you anything—like, say, a bomb threat while on an airplane. Not good.\n\nThen, Apple changed this latter functionality to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" Ever since, if you want to open up your AirDrop to people outside your contacts, you have to manually enable this toggle, which will only stay open for, well, 10 minutes. After that, it switches back to \"Contacts Only.\" That's an improvement in security, but not in convenience. If you're ever in a situation where you need to AirDrop something to someone relatively frequently but you don't want to add their contact to your iPhone, you'll be switching back to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes\" every 10 minutes.\n\niOS 26.2, Apple's newest iPhone update at the time of this writing, introduces a solution—AirDrop codes. This feature forces anyone not saved in your contacts who wants to share something with you via AirDrop to ask for a one-time code first. Once you share that code, that user is temporarily saved on your iPhone for 30 days, allowing you to AirDrop repeatedly without issue. After those 30 days are up, the user leaves your iPhone, and you don't need to worry about pruning your Contacts app down the line. (This same functionality also applies to AirDrop on iPadOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2.)\n\nHere's how this new AirDrop experience works with strangers going forward. Let's say you're at a conference and you meet someone who wants to send you some relevant materials via AirDrop. You set your AirDrop settings to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes,\" they see your contact, and attempt to send you the file.\n\nOn your end, you see the request, with a \"Continue\" option: Once you tap it, you'll see the AirDrop code on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can tell the code to the sender, who can enter it on their device. If successful, the file will be shared like any other AirDrop interaction.\n\nAs stated above, this allows you to AirDrop with this contact for 30 days without needing to bother with another AirDrop code. But if you're done sharing with the stranger for good, you can remove their temporary contact early. Head to the Contacts app, hit the back button in the top left if applicable to head to Lists, then choose Other Known. Here, you'll see any temporary contacts generated from previous AirDrop sessions, which you can delete ahead of that 30 day deadline. Otherwise, your device will take care of it once that timeframe has elapsed.",

    "title": "Gemini 3 Flash Outperforms Gemini 3 Pro and GPT 5.2 In These Key Benchmarks",
    "description": "Small, yet mighty.",
    "fullText": "The AI wars continue to heat up. Just weeks after OpenAI declared a \"code red\" in its race against Google, the latter released its latest lightweight model: Gemini 3 Flash. This particular Flash is the latest in Google's Gemini 3 family, which started with Gemini 3 Pro, and Gemini 3 Deep Think. But while this latest model is meant to be a lighter, less expensive variant of the existing Gemini 3 models, Gemini 3 Flash is actually quite powerful in its own right. In fact, it beats out both Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5.2 models in some benchmarks.\n\nLightweight models are typically meant for more basic queries, for lower-budget requests, or to be run on lower-powered hardware. That means they're often faster than more powerful models that take longer to process, but can do more. According to Google, Gemini 3 Flash combines the best of both those worlds, producing a model with Gemini 3's \"Pro-grade reasoning,\" with \"Flash-level latency, efficiency, and cost.\" While that likely matters most to developers, general users should also notice the improvements, as Gemini 3 Flash is now the default for both Gemini (the chatbot) and AI Mode, Google's AI-powered search.\n\nYou can see these improvements in Google's reported benchmarking stats for Gemini 3 Flash. In Humanity's Last Exam, an academic reasoning benchmark that tests LLMs on 2,500 questions across over 100 subjects, Gemini 3 Flash scored 33.7% with no tools, and 43.5% with search and code execution. Compare that to Gemini 3 Pro's 37.5% and 45.8% scores, respectively, or OpenAI's GPT-5.2's scores of 34.5% and 45.5%. In MMMU-Pro, a benchmark that test a model's multimodal understanding and reasoning, Gemini 3 Flash got the top score (81.2%), compared to Gemini 3 Pro (81%) and GPT-5.2 (79.5). In fact, across the 21 benchmarking tests Google highlights in its announcement, Gemini 3 Flash has the top score in three: MMMU-Pro (tied with Gemini 3 Pro), Toolathlon, and MMMLU. Gemini 3 Pro still takes the number one spot on the most tests here (14), and GPT-5.2 topped eight tests, but Gemini 3 Flash is holding its own.\n\nGoogle notes that Gemini 3 Flash also outperforms both Gemini 3 Pro and the entire 2.5 series in the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, which tests the model's coding agent capabilities. Gemini 3 Flash scored a 78%, while Gemini 3 Pro scored 76.2%, Gemini 2.5 Flash scored 60.4%, and Gemini 2.5 Pro scored 59.6%. (Note that GPT-5.2 scored the best of the models Google mentions in this announcement.) It's a close race, especially when you consider this is a lightweight model scoring alongside these company's flagship models.\n\nThat might present an interesting dilemma for developers who pay to use AI models in their programs. Gemini 3 Flash costs $0.50 per every million input tokens (what you ask the model to do), and $3.00 per every million output tokens (the result the models returns from your prompt). Compare that to Gemini 3 Pro, which costs $2.00 per every million input tokens, and $12.00 per every million output tokens, or GPT-5.2's $3.00 and $15.00 costs, respectively. For what it's worth, it's not as cheap as Gemini 2.5 Flash ($0.30 and $2.50), or Grok 4.1 Fast for that matter ($0.20 and $0.50), but it does outperform these models in Google's reported benchmarks. Google notes that Gemini 3 Flash uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro, which will save on cost, while also being three times faster.\n\nIf you're someone who needs LLMs like Gemini 3 Flash to power your products, but you don't want to pay the higher costs associated with more powerful models, I could image this latest lightweight model looking appealing from a financial perspective.\n\nMost of us using AI aren't doing so as developers who need to worry about API pricing. The majority of Gemini users are likely experiencing the model through Google's consumer products, like Search, Workspace, and the Gemini app.\n\nStarting today, Gemini 3 Flash is the default model in the Gemini app. Google says it can handle many tasks \"in just a few seconds.\" That might include asking Gemini for tips on improving your golf swing based on a video of yourself, or uploading a speech on a given historical topic and requesting any facts you might have missed. You could also ask the bot to code you a functioning app from a series of thoughts.\n\nYou'll also experience Gemini 3 Flash in Google Search's AI Mode. Google says the new model is better at \"parsing the nuances of your question,\" and thinks through each part of your request. AI Mode tries to return a more complete search result by scanning hundreds of sites at once, and putting together a summary with sources for your answer. We'll have to see if Gemini 3 Flash improves on previous iterations of AI Mode.\n\nI'm someone who still doesn't find much use for generative AI products in their day-to-day lives, and I'm not entirely sure Gemini 3 Flash is going to change that for me. However, the balance of performance gains with the cost to process that power is interesting, and I'm particularly intrigued to see how OpenAI responds.\n\nGemini 3 Flash is available to all users starting today. In addition to general users in Gemini and AI Mode, developers will find it in the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, and Google Antigravity, the company's new agentic development platform. Enterprise users can use it in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.",

Gaming continued to take most of the top spots, as fans spent more time in interactive worlds that are constantly updated, like Minecraft and Terraria. In film and TV, long-running franchises like Star Wars and Marvel stayed near the top thanks to new releases like Andor and Thunderbolts.\n\nThe rankings were determined using Fandom's franchise factor score, which combines five things: worldbuilding, strong reviews, loyal fans, cultural impact, and consistency. It uses Fandom's large fan data to give a full picture of how popular and important a franchise is in entertainment and gaming.\n\nAnime also had a big year in large part because of high-profile films and celebrations. Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle brought huge attention as it moved the series toward its finale, while Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc kept momentum high between seasons. There was also the relative newcomer Dan Da Dan, which saw its second theatrical adaptation with Evil Eye.\n\nThe rankings also show a shift away from single launch moments toward steady output. According to Fandom's study, Roblox's top placement reflects how fans now prefer platforms with constant updates and community-created content. Smaller Roblox games, such as Dandy’s World and Grow a Garden, ranked higher than well-established worlds like Minecraft and Disney by focusing on frequent events and active, niche communities.\n\nThe same pattern appeared elsewhere with franchises such as Dungeons and Dragons and Cookie Run Kingdom performed well by releasing content regularly, showing that consistency mattered more than occasional peaks in attention.",

    "fullText": "Englishman James Wade began his PDC World Darts Championship campaign with a 3-0 triumph over Ryusei Azemoto, while Raymond van Barneveld suffered a shock first-round exit.\n\nFive-time world champion Van Barneveld looked out of sorts as he went down in straight sets to Stefan Bellmont, the first Swiss winner at Alexandra Palace.\n\nSeventh seed Wade only let one leg slip in a dominant victory against Japan's Azemoto.\n\n\"Tonight showed the practice I've been doing. It wasn't spectacular but when I really needed to hit something, it happened,\" said four-time semi-finalist Wade.\n\nHe finished with an average of 94.75, compared to Azemoto's 84.42, and the 42-year-old will take on Ricky Evans in the second round on Monday.\n\nVan Barneveld looked a shadow of the player who won four BDO world titles before lifting the PDC crown in 2007.\n\nThe 58-year-old Dutchman took the opening leg but then lost eight in succession.\n\nDespite a higher average than his opponent, he checked out just 25% of his doubles while Bellmont hit 39%.\n\nWorld number 13 Martin Schindler averaged 99.14 and threw seven 180s as the German beat Stephen Burton 3-1 and will face either Keane Barry or Tim Pusey in round two on Sunday.\n\nAmerican debutant Adam Sevada came out on top in the the first game on Wednesday, seeing off Canadian Matt Campbell 3-1.\n\nIt was tight for much of their encounter but Sevada's marginally better performance on doubles made the difference as he won 11 legs to Campbell's six.",

    "fullText": "Over the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",
