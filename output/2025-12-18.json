    "description": "The late-night/early-morning spot for Cubs fans asks if the Cubs should have beaten the Phillies offer for Brad Keller.",
    "fullText": "It’s Wednesday evening here at BCB After Dark: the coolest club for night owls, early risers, new parents and Cubs fans abroad. We’re so glad you decided to stop by. Come on in out of the cold. We can check your hat and coat for you. There are still a couple tables available. They’re all good. The hostess can seat you now. Bring your own beverage.\n\nBCB After Dark is the place for you to talk baseball, music, movies, or anything else you need to get off your chest, as long as it is within the rules of the site. The late-nighters are encouraged to get the party started, but everyone else is invited to join in as you wake up the next morning and into the afternoon.\n\nLast night, I asked you which young Cub with a breakout season in 2025 is most likely to sustain (or improve on) that level in 2026. Like me, the plurality of you are big Michael Busch fans as he got 47 percent of the vote. Cade Horton got 28 percent and 25 percent went with Pete Crow-Armstrong.\n\nHere’s the part where we listen to music and talk movies. You are free to skip that part. Don’t know why you would, but to each his or her own. The BCB Winter Science Fiction Classic features one of my all-time favorite films tonight.\n\nTonight we’re featuring the young vocalist Ella Cole who is making a name for herself performing tunes from the Great American Songbook. And of course, Christmas songs pay the bills that allow one to sing other jazz songs the rest of the year. So she released a Christmas album last year.\n\nHere she is singing “That’s What I Want For Christmas,” which is best known as from a Nancy Wilson performance. This is live in studio last year.\n\nYou voted in the BCB Winter Science Fiction Classic between two time-traveling films and you went with the comedy, as Back to the Future advances over 12 Monkeys. You people do love your incest jokes. It’s OK. No judgments.\n\nToday we have one of the biggest blockbuster films of all time against a low-budget indie film. I expect to be disappointed again, but at least I’ll be more understanding this time.\n\n3. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Directed by James Cameron. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick.\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day is the 1991 big-budget sequel to the 1984 small-budget surprise hit The Terminator. There are many who think the first film was the better one, but it was this film that became a cultural touchstone, made boatloads of money and brought the phrase “Hasta la vista, baby” to the American lexicon.\n\nIn case you are part of the two percent that are unfamiliar with the premise of the Terminator series, the world was destroyed in 1997 a nuclear holocaust by a malevolent artificial intelligence called Skynet. (We all remember that, right?) What remains of the world is ruled by Skynet and its machine creations, which includes the Terminators. In the year 2029, John Connor leads the human resistance to Skynet’s rule, so in the first film, the T-800 Terminator (Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to kill John’s mother Sarah Connor (Hamilton) before he is born. It fails, of course, so in the sequel, Skynet sends a new and improved T-1000 Terminator (Patrick) back in time to kill a ten-year-old John Connor (Edward Furlong). Future John sends back a reprogrammed T-800 (Schwarzenegger again) back in time to save his younger self.\n\nThe paradoxes of such a set-up are not really addressed in the film because Terminator 2: Judgement Day is primarily an action/special effects film. It would, however, be unfair to say that the only point of the plot is to get into big car chases, blow stuff up and make Arnold Schwarzenegger look very cool. It’s unfair because it’s also designed to make Linda Hamilton look cool as hell.\n\nI’m being unjustly snarky there. The heart of the film is really the relationship between the T-800 and the ten-year-old John Connor. John teaches the emotionless robot what it means to be human and why humans have value. In response to the criticisms of the violence in the first film, Cameron has the young John Connor order the T-800 not to kill anyone. Grievously wounding and maiming is just fine, apparently. You wouldn’t want a Terminator who couldn’t fight back at all, especially in a film like this one.\n\nMeanwhile, the T-800 serves as a surrogate father figure and protector figure for John. Along with Sarah, who gets broken out of a mental hospital where she was placed after her repeated rantings about Skynet and Judgment Day, the three of them become a kind of family that draws strength from each other.\n\n(As an aside, the one part of the film that truly bothers me is the way that Cameron fell back on the harmful “evil foster parents” trope early in the film. At least he uses the T-800 to show that you can make a family without biology.)\n\nSchwarzenegger himself is the first to admit that he’s not the greatest actor in the world, but you have to give him credit for this, his greatest role. It helps that his character can’t show emotion, but the film manages to find ways to let T-800 become a character with real “human” traits and a story arc that we can care about. Patrick is terrific as the cold T-1000 villain.\n\nHamilton has to play crazy for much of the film and Cameron pulls off a neat trick by having the creator of Skynet played by Joe Morton. Sarah Connor’s obsession with Skynet leads her to try to murder the man whose creation will doom all of humanity. This is a parallel plot to the way that the T-1000 tries to kill young John. The trick is that Morton is one of the most likable actors around, so if she goes through with killing him, there’s no coming back from the crazy. But she does, and Hamilton does a good job of it. The T-1000 has no such qualms about killing the young John, making a nice contrast between the two attempts to change the future.\n\nAll of this is fine and good, but what elevates Terminator 2: Judgment Day to a classic is the special effects. The T-1000 Terminator (or just the Robert Patrick one if the numbers confuse you) is made out of liquid metal. Shoot it, tear a limb off or whatever, it just oozes back into place. He’s also a shapeshifter that can morph into different people or inanimate objects. T2 wasn’t the first film to use CGI as a special effect, but it was the first one to use it this much and to this great effect. Quite frankly, the effects still look very good by the standards of today. By the standards of 1991, it was positively mind-blowing.\n\nThe special effects were a big, but not the only, reason that the Library of Congress put Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the National Film Registry in 2023. It was also one of the biggest box office hits of all time.\n\nHere’s the trailer for Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n\n6. Repo Man (1984). Directed by Alex Cox. Starring Harry Dean Stanton, Emilio Estevez, Tracey Walter and Olivia Barash.\n\nRepo Man is undoubtedly one of the most creative, out-of-the-box films ever made. Helmed by a first-time director in Cox on a shoestring budget, it throws pretty much everything it can against the wall to see what sticks. It doesn’t all hold together, but what does is pure magic.\n\nRepo Man is a lot of things. It’s a great science fiction comedy film. It’s a good car film. It’s one of the greatest “punk” movies with a fantastic soundtrack featuring the greats of the Los Angeles hardcore scene of the early-eighties as well as an Iggy Pop theme song. It’s one of the more quotable films you’ll ever watch. On top of that, this is a truly great Los Angeles movie, featuring parts of the city that you don’t often see in other films.\n\nDid I mention the whole thing was financed by Michael Nesmith of The Monkees?\n\nThe macguffin of Repo Man is a pair of aliens in the trunk of a ’64 Chevy Malibu. The aliens never leave the trunk, so the special effects are minimal. Also, if you’ve seen Pulp Fiction, the mysterious glow of the briefcase in that film owes a lot to Repo Man. Except in Repo Man, anyone who opens the trunk and looks at the glowing aliens spontaneously combusts and dies, leaving just their shoes.\n\nOtto (Estevez), is an aimless punk who gets roped into helping a car repossession by Bud (Stanton). Initially disgusted by the idea of working as a repo man, he changes his mind after realizing he has no job and no money. Otto comes to love being a repo man after his first real job when he discovers that “the life of a repo man is always intense,” as Bud puts it. Otto, like Bud, likes intense.\n\nAfter a $20,000 bounty comes in for that Chevy Malibu, everyone is out to collect it. Not just Otto and Bud’s Happy Hands Acceptance Company, but the rival Rodriguez brothers, who seem to be a bit more competent at repossessing cars than they are. The CIA also wants the aliens in the Malibu back, as well as a shadowy group called the United Fruitcake Outlet, whom Otto comes in contact with after he picks up the lovely Leila (Barash).\n\nThere is also a group of Otto’s former punk friends who go around “doing crimes” as they put it. They end up stealing the Chevy Malibu by accident.\n\nThe film’s sight gags are legendary. Generic products are everywhere and at one point Otto eats out of a can of food simply labeled “Food.” Pine tree-shaped air fresheners hang everywhere and not just on rear-view mirrors.\n\nThe men and women who work as repo men are also hilarious characters. Bud is best known for his “Repo Man Code” that he recites, but there is also Miller as the crazy mechanic who doesn’t drive and believes every single conspiracy theory he’s ever heard and repeats them in a deadpan manner. The rest of the Happy Hands people have their own wacky personalities as well. The Rodriguez brothers, Leila and her boss Agent Rogersz (Susan Barnes), the punk crime gang of Duke (Dick Rude), Debbi (Jennifer Balgobin) and Archie (Miguel Sandoval) are hilarious characters in their own right\n\nOh, and the Circle Jerks play themselves performing one of their songs as a sad lounge act.\n\nThen there are the quotes. “The life of repo man is always intense” is one, but there are several other lines that you’ll never forget. Many of them I can’t repeat here, but there’s also:\n\nBud: Credit is a sacred trust, it’s what our free society is founded on. Do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia? I said, do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?\n\nDuke: The lights are growing dim Otto. I know a life of crime has led me to this sorry fate, and yet, I blame society. Society made me what I am.\n\nOtto: That’s bull[bleep]. You’re a white suburban punk just like me.\n\nDuke: Yeah, but it still hurts.\n\nDebbi: Duke, let’s do some crimes.\n\nDuke: Yeah. Let’s go get sushi and not pay!\n\nLeila: What about our relationship?\n\nLeila: You [bleep]! I’m glad I tortured you!\n\nAgent Rogersz: It happens sometimes. People explode. Natural causes.\n\nKevin: There’s [bleep] room to move as a fry cook. I could manager in two years. King. God.\n\nAgain, there are several others that I just can’t repeat. The broadcast TV edit of Repo Man is legendary for its creativity as well.\n\nRepo Man is the kind of film that the studios just didn’t get and it basically got buried until the soundtrack started to sell and the record arm at Universal started bugging the film division to start promoting the movie. It got a second release and became an underground hit. It also took off on home video and has remained a cult classic ever since.\n\nHere’s the trailer for Repo Man. There are some more very quotable lines that I didn’t repeat in here.\n\nT2 is on Netflix and Paramount Plus. Repo Man is available for rent.\n\nYou have until Monday to vote. Up next you get another chance to vote for a Terry Gilliam film as Brazil (1985) takes on a classic piece of Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell (1995). Brazil was on TCM last month, I hope you got a chance to watch it. Otherwise, it’s available for rent. Ghost in the Shell is on Amazon Prime (through the end of the month) and the Criterion Channel.\n\nWelcome back to everyone who skips the music and movies.\n\nAs you’ve no doubt heard, former Cubs reliever Brad Keller agreed to a two-year, $22 million deal with the Phillies earlier today. Obviously that’s good news for Keller and bad news for those of us who wanted to see Keller return to the Cubs.\n\nSo tonight’s question is should the Cubs have matched or topped that offer? Keller was a key part of the Cubs bullpen last season, going 4-2 with a 2.07 ERA and three saves. He pitched 69.2 innings and struck out 75 and walked 22. His fastball averaged over 97 miles per hour. His underlying numbers indicate that that wasn’t a total fluke season.\n\nBut of course, relievers and their performance is a volatile thing. As good as Keller was for the Cubs last year, it’s easy to forget that he came to the Cubs on a minor league deal with an invitation to Spring Training. The year before he was released by the White Sox, who lost more games than any other team in modern baseball history.\n\nThat 97 mph fastball was also completely out of line with the rest of Keller’s career, where his velocity was a full four miles per hour slower. Some of that increased velocity is due to pitching out of the bullpen instead of starting, but Keller pitched out of the pen in 2024 and didn’t throw 97 that year. Yes, he made some adjustments coming into last year, but can we really be so sure he’s going to hold that velocity into his thirties?\n\nThe other issue is that from all accounts, the Cubs are still trying to sign starters Tatsuya Imai and Michael King. It’s hard to know how much money they could spend on Keller without knowing how much it will cost to sign one of those two. And neither starter has any incentive to sign anytime soon.\n\nSo you know Brad Keller. Would you take a chance on signing him to a two-year deal? It’s team president Jed Hoyer’s modus operandi to build bullpens out of spare parts and for the most part, he’s been successful doing so. He did give Phil Maton a two-year deal this winter, but for a much lower AAV than Keller got. I’m also reminded how many around here were upset when the Cubs lost out on closer Tanner Scott to the Dodgers last year. Now that was a four-year deal, but I’m sure the Dodgers would just give Scott to the Cubs for free now to get out from under that onerous contract after one terrible year for Scott.\n\nThank you for stopping by. A big thanks goes out to everyone who voted or commented this week. Please get home safely. We can get your coat for you now. Stay warm out there. Recycle any cans and bottles. Tip your waitstaff. And join us again next week for more BCB After Dark.",

    "title": "Golf Channel Games decided by Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy chip off",
    "description": "Rory McIlroy talking about the Golf Channel Games: \"Sometimes when you try something new it doesn't work out. But I think this one really did.\"",
    "fullText": "JUPITER — Shane Lowry could not help himself.\n\nThe Irishman got off to a rough start at the Golf Channel Games — the made-for-TV, silly-season, (unconventional) skills competition held at Trump National Jupiter — sending his first four shots during the driving competition everywhere but in play.\n\nAt one point, the fans attempted to give Lowry the Bethpage Black treatment. Except the boos and trash talk fell a bit short of what Lowry experienced at the Ryder Cup in September.\n\n\"A little bit like New York,\" Lowry said, sarcastically.\n\nMore golf: Here are the big changes TGL golf fans can expect at SoFi Center\n\nTwo four-player teams captained by the top two golfers in the world — No. 1 Scottie Scheffler and No. 2 Rory McIlroy — got together for an event billed as a combination of the NFL Combine, NBA 3-point competition and MLB Home Run Derby.\n\nBut at times this was more like Steph Curry trying to make a 3-pointer with a medicine ball. Or Aaron Judge having to hit the ball on the run.\n\n\"We tried something new,\" said McIlroy, whose team included Lowry, Luke Donald and Haotong Li. \"And sometimes when you try something new it doesn't work out.\n\n\"But I think this one really did. I think the biggest thing is all the players were into it. It was fun. It was a different format, a lot more interaction between the players as opposed to traditional golf. So, yeah, overall it was an awesome night.\"\n\nFor those keeping score at home, Team Scottie, which included Keegan Bradley, Sam Burns and Luke Clanton, defeated Team Rory. With the score tied after the five competitions, the event came down to one chip from just inside 50 yards between the captains.\n\nAnd even then it took two measurements to determine Scheffler's chip was two inches closer to the pin than McIlroy's at 5-feet, 5-inches.\n\nAnd once Scheffler was determined the winner, Lowry picked up his ball and tossed it onto the lake.\n\n\"I thought I got him,\" McIlroy said. \"It looked like from back there that he was a little further away.\"\n\nMcIlroy dominated Scheffler in the Captain's Challenge — the two players hit 10 shots from predetermined spots on the course starting at 200 yards to a 15-foot putt — to force the playoff. And he raised his arms after Scheffler's chip stopped rolling, thinking he was closer.\n\n\"That's what people want,\" McIlroy said. \"They want to see the best players in the world go up against each other, whether it's playing or in a skills challenge or whatever. So for a Wednesday night in December, I think this was pretty good for golf.\"\n\nThe night started with laughs on the range during the driving competition — even McIlroy was doubled over and laughing after Lowrey struggled to keep his ball in play — and continued through the final measurement.\n\nDuring the putting competition, which pitted Lowry against Scheffler, Lowery had a message for his opponent as he approached the first of his nine putts: \"C'mon, Scottie, do your worst.\" It worked, as Lowry won the competition.\n\nIn the team relay, a timed event with one player hitting the tee shot, another in the fairway and two on the green, Lowry hit a poor second shot that landed short of the green. Li was on the green awaiting the ball before realizing he had to hustle to get to Lowry's shot. \"Run my lovely Chinaman,\" Lowry said.\n\nBradley's drive during the team relay was headed straight for teammate Burns, except Burns, standing in the fairway ready to hit the next shot, could not see the ball looking back into the bright lights. \"It's coming at you, Sam,\" Bradley said (players were equipped with earbuds to communicate with each other). Lowry then showed some concern for a member of the other team. \"Literally, it's coming right at you,\" he warned Burns.\n\nScheffler was rushing to hit a 10-foot putt during the team relay when he stopped in his backswing. \"Keegan was yelling at me,\" he said after the miss. \"He made me stop. What are you yelling at me for?\"\n\nThe 14-club challenge pitted two players from each team in a closest-to-the-pin competition from two different spots in the fairway. The catch, they had to use all 14 clubs between them, with the clubs being taken out of the bag as they were hit.\n\nThat resulted in putters and drivers being hit from 150 yards. And a lot of balls in the water. And a lot of trash talk.\n\n\"We have the core audience, which is great, and we know who they are and we know what they like,\" McIlroy said. \"But to try to bring a few more people around or bring a few more people in under the tent, do stuff like this where you make it a little more fun.\n\n\"You look at what YouTube golf's done and you see the amount of people that watch that and enjoy that. This is sort of a hybrid of that. I certainly, I think there's a place for it.\"\n\nTom D'Angelo is a senior sports columnist and reporter for The Palm Beach Post.

    "fullText": "EAST LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) – As the saying goes in the movie ‘ELF,’ the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.\n\nThe Michigan State men’s basketball team was doing exactly that on Wednesday night at One North Kitchen and Bar in East Lansing.\n\nTom Izzo broke out his accordion, and his players sang Christmas carols for those in attendance. Izzo began playing the accordion at the age of 12, stopped when he broke his hand at the age of 13, and started playing again in college.\n\nIzzo told 6 Sports his accordion is around 40 years old, and nights like Wednesday will always mean a lot to him.\n\n“I’m going to talk about it until I’m dead, or until I’m out of here,” Izzo said. “These things are special. I don’t care who you are or what you like; it’s fun to do stuff when people say, ‘Remember when.’ It means a lot to me. Thank God it means something to my players still and thank God it means a lot to my former players.”\n\nWhat made this year’s radio show unique, compared to those in the past, is that senior guard Nick Sanders played the piano while Izzo played the accordion.\n\nSanders has been playing the piano since he was four years old, because his mom ‘forced’ him and his siblings to play. Sanders has been at the holiday radio show all four years of his MSU career and it was on Tuesday when the son of Detroit Lions legend Barry Sanders was told he’d be taking center stage.\n\n“It was nice,” Sanders said about playing at the radio show on Wednesday. ‘Coach had talked to me about it for a few years now. So, it was just a matter of time before I played.”\n\nIzzo said, “He’s incredible. He’s so smart. I told Barry and everybody back home that he was going to be doing it and… (Nick) said he would be more than happy to do it with me.”\n\nThe Spartans will return to action on Saturday in Detroit to take on Oakland at Little Caesars Arena.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — Ezra Ausar and Chad Baker-Mazara each scored double figures and led the USC Trojans offensively en route to a breezy 97-70 victory over the UTSA Roadrunners. With this win, the Trojans improve to 11-1 on the young season and are the only team besides Nebraska in the Big Ten with 11 wins.\n\nTo begin this contest, UTSA and USC were pretty much responding back and forth to each other, and at one point, the Roadrunners had themselves a 31-29 lead in the final three minutes of the first half. It wasn't until the Trojans took over the game from that point on and ended the first half on a 13-0 run and retake the lead, 40-31.\n\n\"You gotta play the guys that have the right frame of mind and want to compete and play unselfish, that's why we played so well,\" Head Coach Eric Musselman said on the difference between the first and second half play and why he decided to go into the second half with the same starting five that ended the first half.\n\nDespite the slow start in the first half, Baker-Mazara amped up his intensity and notched 17 second-half points on 4-10 shooting. Baker-Mazara would finish his night with 20 points (5-13 shooting), 5 rebounds, and five assists.\n\nAusar would lead the Trojans' scoring-wise with 22 points in 31 minutes and recorded his first double-double of the season after snagging his 10th board in the second half.\n\nNo other performance was as superb as senior guard Ryan Cornish, who has really churned the pot as of late, but shone in this win, notching 18 points on 6-10 shooting, including going 4-8 from three-point range, and 4 rebounds in 27 minutes. During the last minutes of the game, Cornish was insinuating to his coaches on the bench that he wanted to sub out due to tiredness, but the Trojans' coaches insisted he stay and finish the remainder of the game.\n\n\"I've got to get into a little better of shape,\" Cornish said with a smile on his face when asked to reflect on the final minutes of the game and what was going on through his head when he was trying to grant a sub. \"I asked for a sub because I was tired, and usually it's a good thing to ask for a sub, because it means you're showing your all.\"\n\nThe Trojans are entering their final week of non-conference play, as they managed to secure a game for Sunday after previously announcing that their last home game of December against Brown University was mutually agreed upon between the schools to be cancelled. USC will now face off against UCSC, a Division III school.",

    "description": "The Utah Mammoth beat the Detroit Red Wings 4-1 on Wednesday",
    "fullText": "Over the last two games, the Utah Mammoth have a goal differential of zero.\n\nThey lost 4-1 to the Boston Bruins on Tuesday and beat the Detroit Red Wings on Wednesday. They managed a .667 points percentage during their eastern road trip and they’re now 3-1-0 in their last four games.\n\nBut the Mammoth are still just shy of a playoff spot, as both the San Jose Sharks and the Los Angeles Kings have multiple games in hand, despite the fact that all three teams are tied in terms of points.\n\nHere’s the story of Utah’s win in Detroit.\n\nKarel Vejmelka maintained a shutout for the first 50 minutes of the game, but Emmitt Finnie spoiled it with a power play goal.\n\nThat goal brought the score to 2-1, turning up the pressure for Utah. But with the increased pressure came an increase in motivation, and Dylan Guenther and Kevin Stenlund added a pair of insurance goals to make sure they didn’t let this one slip.\n\nThey’d struggled to generate offense in Boston, but they got everything they needed in Detroit.\n\n“That group has a lot of pride,” head coach André Tourigny said of his team. “There’s a lot of pride, there’s a lot of character. There’s nobody perfect in the world, but those guys care a ton, and they want to be successful together. They showed it tonight in the character situation.”\n\nBoth Keller and Tourigny credited the Mammoth’s win to their willingness to go to the tough areas.\n\n“I think we just had to be better in the dirty areas, around their net, those 50-50 pucks, kind of all over the ice,” Keller said. “That’s something we had an emphasis on today ... having a guy inside at all times. We do that, the rest takes care of itself in the o-zone.”\n\nAll four of Utah’s goals came from the hash marks or lower, with two of them coming off rebounds. When you have guys like 6-foot-6 Simon Edvinsson and 6-foot-3 Ben Chiarot breathing down your neck, holding your ground in front of the net and battling for the puck in the corners is much easier said than done.\n\nTeam-leading 16th goal of the season for Gunner! pic.twitter.com/2gQMDTc1oe\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 18, 2025\n\n“For a lot of our guys, it’s not first nature,” Tourigny said. “So we need to stay on it. I’m not saying that in a negative way I’m saying that we just need to be aware: If we fall asleep, that will go away. So we cannot. We need to stay aware of it and make the commitment of playing that way, and when we do, we have success, so we have to keep going.”\n\nAs mentioned, the Mammoth benefitted greatly from good goaltending on Wednesday — and while their loss on Tuesday should be chalked up as a team loss rather than an individual one, their goaltending didn’t do them any favors that day.\n\nThere’s a magic number at play here: .900.\n\nWith the exception of three games, all of Utah’s wins this season have involved a save percentage of .900 or better. And with the exception of three games, all of their losses have had a sub-.900 save percentage.\n\nIf they hit that number, they can expect to win. If they don’t hit it, they should expect to lose. And their lineup decisions should reflect that.\n\n“A lot of guys played well tonight, everywhere,” Tourigny said. “If you look at our D corps, we were rock-solid. Our goalie was rock-solid. I like our four lines. ... 4-0 at 5-on-5 against the second team in the Eastern Conference, we’ll take that.”\n\nCriticism surfaced on social media Tuesday morning for Keller’s relative lack of production recently. He’s still on pace for 68 points, but he’s capable of much more than that.\n\nHaving unexpectedly lost his father a few weeks ago, it’s hard to blame him — but the team relies on him for offense all the same, and you know he wants to get back to the 1.5 point-per-game pace with which he began the season.\n\nWednesday’s game was a step in the right direction. He broke a three-game point drought, scoring a goal in the first period and adding an assist in the third.\n\n“Kells, he competes,” said head coach André Tourigny. “I think, tonight, he wanted to make the difference, and he scored a big goal, made a great play on Stenny’s goal, but it’s more than that. It’s the fight he had. ... I felt like that about our team, and it started with our captain.”\n\nThat's our Captain! 🔥\n\n🚨1-0, Utah! pic.twitter.com/H7JvinB3UZ\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 18, 2025\n\nThe bulk of NHL fans weren’t familiar with Emmitt Finnie until October of this year. He was a seventh-round pick in the 2023 draft, so expectations of him were never particularly high. But he surprised a lot of people at training camp and he ended up making the team because of it.\n\nThe 20-year-old scored again on Wednesday, giving him eight goals and 16 points in 35 games this season. That’s a great start to an NHL career, and if he keeps progressing the way he is, he’ll carve out a good living for himself.\n\nIt also doesn’t hurt to have Lucas Raymond and Dylan Larkin as your line mates, and averaging more than a minute and a half of power play time helps, too.\n\nJack McBain gets credit for scoring the goal, but it doesn’t happen in the first place without Michael Carcone’s perfect setup.\n\nCarcone picked up a puck off the end boards and fed McBain a no-look, spin-o-rama pass — the type of play you’d expect to see from a superstar, not someone on a league-minimum contract.\n\nBain Train makes it 2-0, Utah! 🚂 pic.twitter.com/5wU0B53bYJ\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 18, 2025",

    "fullText": "Manchester United played out an eight-goal thriller against Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Monday night.\n\nThe home side will be rightly frustrated to bag only a point, especially after taking the lead on three separate occasions.\n\nIt was Antoine Semenyo who fired home the first equaliser. A brilliant run and finish showed exactly why so many teams are chasing the Ghanaian’s signature.\n\nThe Red Devils are among those clubs, and as previously relayed by The Peoples Person, INEOS are prepared to pay his £65 million release clause in January.\n\nHowever, it will be far from easy given the likes of Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham Hotspur remain hot on his trail as well.\n\nAs revealed by Fabrizio Romano, United and City contacted the Cherries in the last 48 hours to find out their intentions with their star attacker.\n\n“Tottenham are really interested but a lot will depend on what the player wants to do. This week, both Manchester United and Manchester City called to understand the situation of Semenyo.\n\n“On Monday and Tuesday, the calls took place. £65 million is his release clause. Liverpool had called back in November.\n\n“United are genuinely interested but they had spent a lot of money in the summer to sign their three attackers — Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko.\n\n“So we have to see whether they can afford the sum in January. More than money and finances, the player will ultimately decide where he wants to go.”\n\nWith Amad and Bryan Mbeumo set to be away for AFCON, bringing in the versatile Antoine Semenyo would be a great way to offset those losses.\n\nHe is the third top-scorer in the division this campaign, and can play as a No.10 and wingback, which would suit Amorim’s requirements down to the T.\n\nHowever, what United need most right now is a defensive midfielder. INEOS will take the final call.\n\nFeature image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Old Dominion collects signature win to finish best season ever, while holding the nation’s #2 offense to 10 points.",
    "fullText": "The Old Dominion Monarchs fully joined the FBS in 2014 and rapidly acclimated to the highest level of college football, producing a 10-3 record in 2016. However, through the 2024 season, that was the only winning season Old Dominion ever produced. That changed in 2025, and the program reached a new pinnacle on Wednesday night in Orlando.\n\nSixth-year head coach Ricky Rahne rattled off nine regular season wins to seal Old Dominion’s second winning record as an FBS program, and this breakout 2025 aptly concluded with a statement 24-10 upset over South Florida in the StaffDNA Cure Bowl. In the process, the Monarchs earned their biggest win in program history, adding a second bowl trophy to the shelf while tying their FBS record for wins in a season.\n\nSouth Florida entered this matchup ranked second in the FBS in points (43.0) and yards (502) per game, lighting up opponents with seven games of 48+ points. Only twice did the Bulls score fewer than 31 all season — an 18-16 win over Florida and a 49-12 defeat to playoff-bound Miami (FL). USF faced obvious obstacles with the losses of head coach Alex Golesh (to Auburn), quarterback Byrum Brown, and Keshaun Singleton, and the Bulls could not overcome those absences nor the Old Dominion defense.\n\nSouth Florida registered just 10 points, scoring one first half touchdown and facing a second half shutout to a relentless Monarch bunch. Old Dominion made its presence felt with four sacks and five takeaways, concocting a +4 in the turnover battle against one of the nation’s best turnover-producing teams. Outside linebacker Jeremy Mack totaled a game-high 11 tackles and a sack, while free safety Jerome Carter snagged two interceptions in a 3.5-hour defensive clinic by the boys from Norfolk.\n\nOld Dominion’s offense also faced some pregame adversity, as Sun Belt Offensive Player of the Year Colton Joseph opted out of the remainder of the 2025 season, thrusting Quinn Henicle into the starting quarterback spot. Henicle started and won a game in 2024 with 204 rushing yards, and the sophomore’s mobility was on full display in ODU’s massive win. He only completed 11-of-25 passes but made his presence felt on broken plays, scrambling up the middle for massive gains. Even after four sacks he rattled off 107 rushing yards and two touchdowns, delivering a 51-yard blow with 2:32 remaining to put the game out of reach. Henicle, who returned from a brief third quarter injury stemming from a targeting call, won MVP honors for his effort in Orlando.\n\nSouth Florida’s backup quarterbacks did not enjoy the same level of production as Henicle. Sixth-year senior Gaston Moore earned his first and last collegiate start at quarterback to replace Byrum Brown, and Moore finished 20-of-28 with 236 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. He had one first half sequence where he connected with true freshman Jeremiah Koger for back-to-back 25 and 31-yard pickups — with the latter serving as USF’s lone touchdown. But there wasn’t much explosiveness in the passing game otherwise.\n\nMoore’s last throw was a notable one, and unfortunately for the longtime backup, it was his final collegiate pass. In the fourth quarter, trailing 17-10, he sent a 20-yard strike to JeyQuan Smith at the Old Dominion 14-yard line, and Smith made a spectacular diving grab. However, Moore took a brutal hit while releasing the ball that caused his head to collide with the Camping World Stadium field, ultimately knocking him out of the final 12 minutes.\n\nProtesting the hit, South Florida guard Cole Skinner and interim head coach Kevin Patrick were both assessed with 15-yard unsportsmanlike penalties. Then USF took a sack and holding on the next two plays, ultimately moving the Bulls back from the Old Dominion 14 to their own 38 — a monumental 48-yard difference. USF never even crossed the ODU 40-yard line again, as those penalties proved instrumental in the defeat.\n\nTrue freshman Locklan Hewlett, whose passing experience was limited to a 45-yard fake punt touchdown in Week 1, finished the effort for the Bulls. But on a 4th and 6 from its own 47-yard line with 3:45 remaining, South Florida made the questionable decision to run a fake punt — this time, without Hewlett disguising as a punter. Punter Chase Leon was intercepted by Jerome Carter on a play that never stood a chance, ultimately putting a dagger in USF’s hopes at a 10-win season.\n\nSpecial teams also played a significant role in this contest. Both teams missed two field goals in this game, including several attempts under 40 yards. But special teams ended up favoring Old Dominion overall as the Monarchs denied South Florida of a critical fourth quarter possession. An ODU punt hit a USF gunner two times on Wednesday evening, and on the second occurrence, Monarch long snapper Brendan Durkin made a mid-air recovery after the ball bounced off the gunner and return man.\n\nSouth Florida (9-4, 6-2 American) missed out on a golden opportunity for its first 10-win season since 2017. The Bulls enjoyed their best season in nearly a decade but it comes to a bitter end, as they will be denied a season-ending ranking — a feat the team hasn’t accomplished in eight years. The Bulls now officially move into the Brian Hartline era, as the Ohio State offensive coordinator relocates to Tampa when the Buckeyes’ playoff run is complete.\n\nOld Dominion (10-3, 6-2 Sun Belt) sealed its best season as an FBS member with a victory for the ages. Two of the three Monarch losses — Indiana and James Madison — are competing in the College Football Playoff, and they now unlock a new signature win by upending South Florida. Ricky Rahne celebrated his first bowl win as head coach, capping off an unforgettable moment in the program’s young history.",

Before USC, led a top 15 defense at UCLA. pic.twitter.com/vkLnzqvodx\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) December 18, 2025\n\nA Penn State player from 2008-2011, Lynn was an NFL assistant from 2014-2022, working his way up from being a seasonal intern with the New York Jets to the safeties coach for the Ravens. He made the move to the college game in 2023, serving as the defensive coordinator at UCLA for one season and at USC for the past two. In both cases, he took over horrendous units and improved them mightily right away. Below is where the Bruins and Trojans defenses ranked in SP+ before Lynn’s arrival and then during his tenure.\n\nBefore D’Anton Lynn: UCLA (2022) — 83rd\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: UCLA (2023 — 17th\n\nBefore D’Anton Lynn:USC (2023) — 105th\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: USC (2024) — 48th\nDuring D’Anton Lynn: USC (2025) — 35th\n\nAt Penn State, he wouldn’t be taking over a dreadful unit — the Nittany Lions, even in a down defensive season, finished 33rd in SP+. But there’s still the element of a lot of transition with NFL departures and potential transfer portal movement that bringing in someone like Lynn who gets improved results right away would be an awesome fit.\n\nSo the guy is good. Really good. And it’d be quite the hire for Matt Campbell to get him just 12 months after the last guy got turned down.\n\nD’Anton Lynn was asked last week why he stayed on as USC’s DC after Penn State, his alma mater, pursued him. \n\nLynn: “I just couldn’t imagine myself coaching anybody else.”\n\n“The people we have here, it was just too tough to leave.”\n\n— Ryan Kartje (@RyanKartje) May 5, 2025\n\nWe’ll see where this goes. It’s a good sign to get a tweet like that from Zenitz, but until there’s a “are finalizing a deal” tweet, this one remains up in the air.",

    "description": "Smith was judged to have been caught behind despite the technology not matching up again",
    "fullText": "Jamie Smith was at the centre of the latest controversy with Snicko technology during a tense day of Test cricket at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nSmith looked to hook a short ball from Pat Cummins and seemingly missed the ball which flew through to Alex Carey behind the stumps.\n\nCarey, Cummins and co. all appealed believing Smith to have made contact with the ball but the England batter was ready to review the umpire’s decision.\n\nBut, the umpire decided to send for a review to see if the ball had cleanly landed in Carey’s hands before making a decision on the field. As part of that process a replay of the incident was shown with Snicko showing a spike after the ball had passed Smith’s bat. At the same time there seemed to be a gap between the bat and ball but the third umpire ruled that Smith had hit the ball and was out.\n\nEngland captain Ben Stokes, who was batting at the time, dropped his head in disbelief when the decision was shown on the big screen. Smith’s dismissal left England 159-6 and over 200 runs behind Australia’s first innings total of 371.\n\nThe controversy was just one of several incidents on day two in which the technology process was questioned. Earlier examples saw Smith glove the ball to Usman Khawaja at second slip and Joe Root get an inside edge through to Carey. In both instances the ball bounced before reaching the respective fielders.\n\nOn Test Match Special, Alex Hartley labelled the controversies as ‘ridiculous’ and claimed that the Snicko technology needed ‘sacking’.\n\nShe said: “It is going to boot off here. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. This is where Snicko needs sacking.\n\n“The third umpire said there is nothing obvious there as he could see a gap between the bat and ball. Jamie Smith is convinced he didn't hit it. Australia have gone up and made a loud noise because everybody knows you don't trust Snicko now, so you appeal for everything and review it if you have to.\n\n“Ben Stokes has his hands on his hips. Smith has gone off shaking his head.”\n\nHer view was echoed by former England players Greame Swann and Steven Finn on TNT Sports who both called out the inaccuracies in the technology and for it to be removed.\n\n“It just doesn’t make sense,” said Swann, “Cricket makes itself open to ridicule sometimes.”\n\nThe incident follows yesterday’s controversy over Alex Carey’s DRS review which resulted in him being given not out on 72 despite hitting the ball.",

    "description": "Utes played uncharacteristically sloppy against UC Riverside but used a big third quarter to earn the win.",
    "fullText": "Utah women’s basketball coach Gavin Petersen had a message at halftime for those watching the Utes take on UC Riverside on Wednesday night at the Huntsman Center.\n\n“Apologies to everyone who just watched that. That is not Utah basketball,” he said during a halftime interview on the ESPN+ livestream.\n\nThe Utes had 15 first-half turnovers and were just 4 of 15 from the free-throw line after two quarters against the Highlanders, who entered the night with a 2-7 record but were giving Utah everything that they had in a sloppy game.\n\n“The last five games leading to this one, we were starting to hit our stride, and today, I think I don’t know if it’s Christmas shopping, if it’s just preparing for the break. We have our team Christmas party tomorrow. It’s just a lot of distractions,” Petersen said in an postgame interview on 700 AM.\n\n“... The process is something to embrace, because that process is going to get you a big win come January and February, and that is our stride. Again, glad we won, we can learn the same lessons in a win.”\n\nIt leaves plenty of room for improvement and a re-focus on the fundamentals as Utah gears up for Big 12 play, which starts for the Utes with a road matchup at Arizona next Monday (12 p.m. MST, ESPN+).\n\nUtah’s uncharacteristic play at the Huntsman on Wednesday was bailed out by a dominant stretch during the third quarter, when the Utes went on a 21-4 run over a six-and-a-half minute stretch to turn a one-point game into a 54-36 Utah lead going into the fourth quarter.\n\nUtah shot 13 of 18 in the third quarter and made nine of its first 10 shots in the period, outscoring visiting UC Riverside 31-12 in the third.\n\nThank goodness, because the Highlanders outscored Utah 16-7 in the fourth — in fact, the Utes scored more points in the third quarter alone (31) than they did the other three quarters of the game combined (30).\n\nReese Ross helped lead that effort, as she had her first double-double of the season with 17 points and a career-high 13 rebounds. She also had a team-high six turnovers, though — more on that in a minute.\n\nRoss got the 21-4 run off to a blazing start with back-to-back steals that turned into layups, and six different Utes scored during the run.\n\nUtah outscored UC Riverside 18-4 in points in the paint in the third — flipping that stat in the Utes’ favor on the night — and used its defense to help set up the offense on what was an overall shaky night.\n\n“It’s so important to be able to respond, and I think we did that,” Ross said in an ESPN+ interview, about Utah’s ability to respond and take charge in the third quarter.\n\n“I mean, there’s a lot of things we can learn from this game. ... It’s important, every failure is an opportunity to grow. So just being able to take ownership of what we can get better at and applying it in practice and taking initiative.”\n\nThe Highlanders had one last run in them, using a 10-0 spurt in the fourth quarter to make it a 56-46 game with five minutes to play.\n\nUtah didn’t fold against the visitors, though UC Riverside, to its credit, made life difficult for the Utes all night.\n\nIt’s a good thing UC Riverside shot just 35.1% from the field — and 30.8% in that critical third period — or the Highlanders might have had a real shot to steal a win against Utah, which shot 46% on the night.\n\nThough UC Riverside lost 20 turnovers, the Highlanders forced Utah into 23, the most for the Utes in this six-game win streak.\n\nIt’s a discouraging return to not taking care of the ball. Earlier this season, Utah had 20 or more turnovers in a stretch of four out of five games.\n\nThe Utes lost three of those games, and repeating 20 or more turnovers in Big 12 contests will severely hamper Utah’s chances for victory in one of the nation’s top conferences.\n\n“We knew that they were going to be intentional on defense. I mean, it’s just something we need to be intentional about, not taking reps off and making everything like it’s game like,” Ross said. “And I think, too, it’s good right before conference to get what it’s like to have a pressure defense, because it’s so important. That’s what we’re going to see every single game coming up in conference.\n\n“So we’re just making sure, again, we’re adjusting to pressure defense. Every team sees it. We struggle with pressure. So being able to understand that there’s an opportunity to grow.”\n\nSeven Utah players had two or more turnovers, led by Ross with her six, as well as four each from LA Sneed and Chyra Evans.\n\nPetersen stressed the importance of limiting turnovers, including with Ross, who otherwise paced the Utes’ efforts against UC Riverside.\n\n“With Reese, you know what you get (with) intensity. She’s going to play hard, she’s a rebounder, and she’s going to give it everything she’s got,” Petersen said. “I would love to utilize her more, and that trust has to come with not turning the ball over.”\n\nUtah got some other key contributions from freshmen Avery Hjelmstad and Evelina Otto, a welcome sight on a quiet night for seniors Lani White (8 points) and Maty Wilke (4).\n\nHljelmstad hit two big second-quarter 3-pointers when UC Riverside threatened to increase its then-six point lead, and Hjelmsted was the only other Ute in double-figures, with 10 points. She also had three rebounds and an assist.\n\nOtto came off the bench and helped Utah’s inside presence, scoring 5 points to go with seven rebounds and three assists as the Utes held a 36-20 edge in points in the paint and outrebounded the Highlanders 43-29.\n\nThat was enough to fend off UC Riverside, who was led by a game-high 19 points from Seneca Hackley. She made three of the Highlanders’ seven 3-pointers, while Utah was just 4 of 20 from 3-point range as a team.\n\nBetween the turnovers and free-throw woes especially, there are numbers on the stat sheet the Utes can point to when a lack of focus is discussed from this one.\n\nIt was an abysmal night at the free-throw line for Utah, which finished 9 of 21 at the stripe. Petersen said when he went into halftime and asked who had worked on free throws this week, only one player raised their hand.\n\n“We didn’t have school this week, so like, who got in and shot free throws? One person raised their hand at halftime,” Petersen said. “Well, that’s why you’re gonna shoot from the free-throw line the way you did in first half. Basketball rewards putting in the time and again, that’s something that I want to make sure these young kids understand.”\n\nUtah will have five days to remedy some of those fundamental issues that popped up Wednesday in what was the Utes’ worst effort during their six-game winning streak.\n\n“It’s on us to get back into the practice facility, work on the skills and the fundamentals of basketball so they can thrive when the lights come on,” Petersen said. “And we just didn’t do a good job of that in our one day of prep for UC Riverside. Again, that falls on me, so we’ll definitely fix it.”",

    "fullText": "City have made seven changes for tonight’s Carabao Cup quarter-final clash with Brentford at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nNico O’Reilly, Tijjani Reijnders, Nico and Rayan Cherki are the four starters from Sunday’s 3-0 victory over Crystal Palace in the Premier League that keep their place.\n\nDivine Mukasa returns to the starting line-up after featuring in the previous League Cup wins over Huddersfield and Swansea while fellow Academy players Stephen Mfuni and Charlie Gray are on the bench.\n\nAs well as the injured trio of John Stones, Rodri and Jeremy Doku, we are without Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri who have joined up with Egypt and Algeria, respectively, for the African Cup of Nations.\n\nCITY XI: Trafford, Lewis, Khusanov, Ake (C), O’Reilly, Nico, Reijnders, Bobb, Cherki, Savinho, Mukasa\n\nSubs: Donnarumma, Dias, Haaland, Bernardo, Gvardiol, M Nunes, Foden, Gray, Mfuni\n\nBRENTFORD XI: Valdimarsson, Henry, Van den Berg, Ajer, Collins (C), Kayode, Jensen, Yarmoliuk, Damsgaard, Janelt, Schade.\n\nSubs: Kelleher, Hickey, Pinnock, Lewis-Potter, Peart-Harris, Konak, G Nunes, Arthur, Donovan.\n\nMukasa played as a false-nine in our two previous League Cup wins and could well lead the line for Pep Guardiola’s side tonight.\n\nOscar Bobb and Savinho would then be the wingers although the boss does have the options with the latter able to play centrally.\n\nBut Cherki has also impressed as a wide midfielder so could potentially drop into a more central role alongside Reijnders and Nico.\n\nThere’s plenty for Pep to consider from his starting XI ahead of kick-off.\n\nIt’s another great day for our Academy with five homegrown players starting and three more on the bench.\n\nLeft-footed defender Mfuni was an unused sub in the third round win at Huddersfield while Gray is part of the squad for the first time.\n\nFrom Manchester, Gray is a hard-working holding midfielder who is also capable of playing in a more box-to-box role.\n\nBoth have with the Club since the under-nines and were part of the successful 2024 Youth Cup campaign.\n\nBrentford are also without two players at the African Cup of Nations with Frank Onyeka and Dango Ouattara joining up with the Nigeria and Burkina Faso squads.\n\nWe kept a clean sheet when we won 1-0 at the Gtech Community Stadium in the Premier League as we stood up to the high balls coming into the area.\n\n“They can put the ball in the box from the halfway line, so I think we are prepared for any type of game of course every week or every three days,” Matheus Nunes said after our win at Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\n“We have to prepare differently in certain parts of the game, but mostly when it comes to teams that play low blocks specifically we know that they’re going to put a lot of crosses in.”\n\nThis is just the second campaign we have faced Brentford in the League Cup, winning 5-3 on aggregate in the 1989/90 second round (1-2 away, 4-1 home).\n\nSince doing the Premier League double over City in 2022/23, Brentford have lost four of their last five against City in all competitions.\n\nThis is our first League Cup quarter-final since a 2-0 loss to Southampton in 2022/23. Prior to that, they had progressed from eight consecutive ties at this stage of the competition.\n\nBrentford have reached the League Cup quarter-final for the fourth time in the last six seasons. They beat Newcastle 1-0 in 2020/21, before defeats to Chelsea (2021/22) and the Magpies (2024/25).\n\nCity have won nine of our last 10 home games in the League Cup, scoring 31 goals in the process. The only exception was a 1-0 loss to Manchester United in the 2019/20 semi-final, a tie from which they progressed anyway.\n\nBrentford have won their last two away games in the League Cup, seeing off Grimsby Town 5-0 in round four. Only once have they won three in a row on the road in the competition, doing so between 2017 and 2018.\n\nPhil Foden has been involved in 11 goals in his last 11 starts in the League Cup for City (4 goals, 7 assists). He’s also scored seven goals in eight appearances against Brentford in all competitions.\n\nSeven of Brentford’s eight League Cup goals this season have been scored by different players, with Fabio Carvalho the only player to score more than once. It is already their most ever different scorers in a single League Cup campaign (excluding own goals).",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO – During the week head coach Brian Dutcher likened San Diego State’s games with Air Force to ‘a trip to the dentist.’ After gritting their teeth through the first half, the Aztecs earned their lollipop with a 81-58 win over the Falcons on Wednesday night at Viejas Arena.\n\nBJ Davis scored 13 of his 19 points over a 4:10 stretch in the second half to go with a game-high 6 assists, while Miles Heide had 12 points and eight rebounds to go with Taj DeGourville having his best scoring game since the season opener with 9 points on three 3’s.\n\nDefense keyed the second half swing after San Diego State (6-3, 1-0) led by 3 points at the half of their final Mountain West Conference opener. They dished a season-high 27 assists, making just four baskets without a helper, and forced 10 of Air Force’s (3-9, 0-1) 15 turnovers in the second half, getting 14 of their 19 points off turnovers in the final 20 minutes.\n\nThe second half began with a scrambling no-look save by Miles Byrd to Magoon Gwath in the post, who fed it up top for Heide to knock down his first 3-pointer of the season and the third from downtown of his career.\n\nSDSU and the Falcons traded scores until Heide picked up his third personal foul at the 15:13 mark, which brought Pharaoh Compton into the game and raised the temperature for the Aztec defense. After the Falcons turned it over just four times in the opening half, they turned it over five times in the first eight minutes of the second.\n\nHarrington got free for a straight-line drive for a layup and then Compton got fouled on a dunk for an and-1 that gave the Scarlet and Black their first double-digit lead at the 14:13 mark.\n\nDavis then had his ‘hibachi’ moment, knocking down a 3-pointer to start a stretch where he scored 13 of SDSU’s next 15 points. Over that span the Aztec lead grew to 61-44 and then even further when Gwath split a pair of free throws and DeGourville tripled.\n\nSDSU allowed the Falcons to score multiple buckets in a row just once in the second half, a 6-0 stretch just after the nine minute mark, but by then the game was well out of reach.\n\nA final run of 9-0 put a bow on things, with Davis knocking down the final of his four triples and Compton punctuating it with a dunk, as the forward had 11 points in 17 minutes off the bench.\n\nBrandon Pollard - The Sporting Tribune\n\nSan Diego State forward Miles Heide (40) fights for the ball during an NCAA Basketball game between Air Force and San Diego State, Wednesday December 17, 2025 at Viejas Arena in San Diego, Calif.\n\nIt had seemed too easy over the first few possessions for the Aztecs, beginning the game with an and-1 by Gwath and a cutting Heide layup in the first 42 seconds of the game.\n\nBut the Falcons 3-2 zone caused problems when SDSU was forced to work their half-court set, going scoreless over a 5:32 stretch where they missed eight in a row from the field. During that time the Falcons opportunistically converted on a pair of open 3-pointers in an 8-0 spurt that led to an early 3 point lead.\n\nIt grew as large as 4 points when Eli Robinson tripled again from the right wing at 12:49, but a steal and score by Davis led to a transition dunk that woke up the Scarlet and Black offense.\n\nJeremiah Oden splashed a long ball, then Reese Dixon-Waters found Heide left alone in the middle of the zone for an uncontested dunk, which kick-started SDSU’s sixth 10-plus point run of the season. Playing with a quicker tempo helped the Aztecs reel off six makes in a row, pushing the lead out to 23-15 with 8:28 remaining, then after a Falcons make, DeGourville nailed a straight-away 3-pointer to give SDSU their largest lead of the half.\n\nBut the Scarlet and Black struggled shooting down the stretch, making just three shots—all on layups or in the paint— while missing 11 of their final 14 shots from the field. It enabled the Falcons to creep back within 33-30 at the half.\n\nNine of the Aztecs that played in the opening 20 made a field goal, with Gwath and Heide’s 7 points apiece the most on the squad.\n\nAfter notching a win against a team ranked well into the 300’s in most major overall metrics, the Aztecs will face the No. 1 Arizona Wildcats next. Tip off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 20 at PHX Arena in Phoenix, Ariz.",

    "fullText": "Moises Caicedo will miss part of Chelsea’s Carabao Cup semi-final as The Blues get a tough London draw for the next round.\n\nThe midfielder was booked in the last game for a sarcastic clapping action towards the Referee, which was very silly. And now, per The Daily Mail, he misses the first leg of the next round which happens to be the semi-finals.\n\nIt looking at the draw for the semi-finals, which happened late on Wednesday evening, it looks like Caicedo is going to be a big miss for The Blues.\n\nThat is because they are either up against Arsenal, or Crystal Palace, depending on the winner of that game of course. It will be a very tough London tie no matter whether Chelsea end up facing the current Premier League leaders and favourites, or Crystal Palace, who are having a very good season under the management of Oliver Glasner so far.\n\nPedro Neto celebrates against Cardiff. (Photo by Dan Istitene/Getty Images)\n\nDespite beating Cardiff City 3-1 in the quarter finals of the competition earlier in the week, Chelsea can count themselves quite lucky to be in the semi-finals due to the fact that Cardiff were very much unlucky to lose against them. It was 1-1 in the game until two late goals from two Chelsea subs that Enzo Maresca had to bring on because the current crop of players on the pitch were just not performing.\n\nChelsea can beat any team on their day so it’s a fact now that they have a decent chance of reaching the final now and even winning the competition altogether.\n\nMaresca and his young side would love to add more silverware to their achievements.",

    "fullText": "A player of his quality, who gives so many options for Liverpool and only costs £65m would be an absolute bargain.\n\nLet's wait and see what happens because it feels like the entire Premier League also wants to sign him.\n\nBut what people forget about Semenyo is his story. He is the ultimate underdog. When he was a teenager he was rejected by massive clubs, including Arsenal.\n\nHe hadn't really played academy football until he arrived at Bristol City as an 18-year-old. Then he went on loan to the National League and League Two, playing for Bath City and Newport County.\n\nThose loans meant he was able to play for Bristol City's first-team, where he slowly established himself as one of the best young attackers in the Championship, catching Bournemouth's attention in the process.\n\nNow it seems like Bristol City are ready to write another success story. But this time around, their next Semenyo could be from Liverpool.\n\nAccording to Ian Gay a Managing Consultant and Mentor, who is well connected to Bristol City on X, the club has agreed a deal for Ranel Young to join the Championship side.\n\nFootball Insider have also confirmed Bristol City's agreement with Young.\n\nGay mentions how Young is seen as a similar profile to Semenyo.\n\nHe's 19-years-old and spent the majority of his academy career at Liverpool, he even sat on the bench for the first-team two times under Arne Slot but never made an appearance before being released by the club.\n\nYoung has since spent the last few months in Serbia, moving to a second division side in what was a bizarre move.\n\nNow he's back in England and at Bristol he looks like he will be given the pathway to restore his career and make a name for himself.\n\nWhether he can actually follow in the footsteps of Semenyo remains to be seen.",

    "fullText": "In a much-anticipated showdown between 5A contenders on Wednesday night — a rematch in fact of last year’s semifinal — it took Bountiful a bit to get going, but once it did it never looked back.\n\nBountiful coach Joel Burton thought his players looked a bit fatigued in the opening minutes perhaps due to a game against Skyline the night before, but they settled in quick building a nine-point lead by the end of the quarter and never looked back on their way to the 56-46 win at Wasatch.\n\n“I felt like our legs were tired as we started the game, and just took us a little while to kind of get into the flow of what we like to do. And just to see us kind of loosen up … and then the shots started dropping. And so it was just nice seeing our kids get flowing again last—there tonight,” said Burton.\n\nBountiful used balanced scoring to secure the win, with Ute signee Milika Satuala leading the way with 15 points, followed by Maleah Nelson with a dozen, Maile Murdock with 11 and Brynna Castleton with 10.\n\n“I’ll take that every game if I can get it. We’ve got some young kids that are definitely growing up and starting to take a little bit of the pressure off of that starting five, thank goodness. So it’s nice to see Miley and Peyton (Orchard) really starting to fill that role, and among many others that are starting to just get confident playing at the varsity level,” said Burton.\n\n“We knew that was going to be the issue coming into the year was finding that group behind the first —behind our starting five, and we’re starting to figure that out.\"\n\nMuch of Bountiful’s damage was done in the first half, as it opened up a 16-7 lead after the first quarter and then stretched it to 21-7 at the 5:54 mark of the second quarter on a corner 3-pointer from the freshman Murdock, her third of the game.\n\nWasatch finally halted the Redhawks’ fast start to cut the lead to 10 by halftime.\n\nWasatch’s press caused some turnover issues late in the game for Bountiful, which saw its lead whittle to seven points in the final minute, but the Wasps ran out of time to cut into the lead another further as it fell to 10-2 on the season.\n\nThe win pushes three-time defending state champion Bountiful’s record to 8-1 on the season.",

    "title": "China Speed",
    "description": "Erik on product management and such",
    "fullText": "DILEMMA WORKS\nErik on product management and such\n\nOn China Speed\n\nHow Chinese firms work and how they perform in the market is a matter of perspective that gives entirely opposite outcomes. If you are outside of China and see the brands emerging on the global market - BYD, DJI, Insta360, OnePlus before the merger with OPPO, etc. - you may be of the view that their companies are unstoppable because they manage to combine high-performing products, a good user- and ownership experience, quality, competitive pricing, with high speed of execution. They simply design an launch new products faster than anyone else can. You may therefore have formed that “China Speed’ is the key to competing with China’s global brands.\n\nIf you are inside China, however, you will instead view these firms as unicorns, and your view will instead be filled with the hundreds or thousands of firms that fail to move past push-selling and price competition, brands that are unknown or have negative connotations because of shoddy product quality and after-sales service. You are more likely to see chuhai, or growing into the global market, as something almost unachievable.\n\nSpeed is a significant strategic advantage provided that you are moving in the right direction, meaning you have a strategy, and you do so without sacrificing quality.\n\nChina Speed is now one of the concepts that are going to be taken at face level and bragged about by the same people who have recently started talking about how they work 996 (they don’t).\n\nLike with 996, China Speed is fundamentally misunderstood and therefore can never be applied outside of China. There are in fact two types of China Speed. The productive type does not come from doing things quickly at all. It comes from structural advantages that have been built over decades, like having your office next to the factory, which itself is next to all of its relevant suppliers.\n\nIn the example of BYD, their advantage is not only that they own their factories and that 70% of their components are made by suppliers owned by the BYD group, or that they can get better margins by controlling prices. What really creates and advantage is that they can design and prototype a new model, together with the parts that go into it that will be manufactured by its suppliers, instead of having to go through long contract negotiations to get the parts that enable a new model to be launched.\n\nBYD employees undoubtedly work longer hours and perhaps at a higher pace than automotive employees in Europe, but it is not what makes up BYD’s formula for success, because the structural advantage is in place after decades of methodical construction. Unlike employees at TikTok Shop, which I below reference as an example of destructive speed, BYD employees are not pushing on a string.\n\nThe destructive type is focusing on doing everything, doing anything no matter what it is, just as long as you do it quickly. In organizations that favor this type of speed, China Speed is a form of procrastination at the leadership level, so that they will not have to do the hard work of forming a vision and making decisions that can prove to either be good or bad. They fear the latter outcome, so they tell their teams to do things quickly, just A/B test something, actually a lot of things, and show me the results of the things that happen to work out, so I can put it in my report and show leadership.\n\nThis is speed, no chaos, as a value above everything. It sacrifices quality, it sacrifices relationships with business partners as well as customers and it destroys the brand. In another essay I’m currently working on, I will outline how Chinese firms grow in the global markets, what stages they go through and what organizational capabilities they must build up. The firms that try to just be faster will never get past the second stage, which is price leadership, and many don’t even get past stage one.\n\nThese leaders say they really care about data, but they don’t because they don’t make any decisions. They want experiment results, and they want to show them as achievements to their managers. But they never use data to inform strategy.\n\nFor Chinese firms going global, focusing on speed above all else means that failure is a given. Lets look at ByteDance and their TikTok Shop as an example. You would probably say that ByteDance, through TikTok, is an example of a Chinese organization that is adept at launching global products. But ByteDance did not build TikTok, they acquired musical.ly and its 240 million userbase and re-branded it. It is only through this foundation they have been successful.\n\nWhen ByteDance try to build global products from 0, they have a much lower rate of success, and TikTok Shop is a monumental failure in every region it has been launched - in UK and Europe, in the US and in Southeast Asia.\n\nThis is the story from Indonesia:\n\nLast year, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDancei, acquired a majority stake in its Indonesian online retail rival, Tokopedia, to abide by local laws that restrict social media companies from running e-commerce businesses. Following the acquisition, TikTok tucked its app interface into Tokopedia, and rebranded the platform as TikTok Shop by Tokopedia.\n\nThe merger has disrupted Indonesia’s $65 billion e-commerce market, Simon Torring, co-founder of market research firm Cube Asia told Rest of World. Since the acquisition, TikTok has laid off at least 2,500 employees across the merged entity, while sellers say they have lost agency over the platform.\n\n“Tokopedia’s sales volume has continued to decline steadily after ByteDance’s acquisition,” Torring told Rest of World. “For the first couple of quarters, we gave them the benefit of the doubt of being a new owner carrying out messy integration work. At this point, it’s clear that they are not investing strategically in Tokopedia.”\n\n“I’m not planning to make videos or to do livestream [to promote my products],” Helmin, a seller from Jakarta, told Rest of World. Helmin, who asked to be identified by her first name only, said she directed buyers to her Shopee store instead, where she continues to sell snacks and beverages imported from Korea, Vietnam, and Turkey.\n\nSo messy has TikTok’s merger been that it’s driven thousands of sellers to Toco, a little-known platform promising zero fees for life. Shopee and TikTok take a 2.5% cut from each sale.\n\n“In Southeast Asia, Chinese companies usually invest [in other companies], instead of managing [them] directly, like how Shopee is backed by Tencent and Lazada by Alibaba,” Ming Yii Lai, research manager at Shanghai-based Daxue Consulting, told Rest of World. “[Now], they localize their operations, with independent CEOs making very fast decisions.”\n\nThat strategy isn’t paying off in Indonesia, where many sellers say Tokopedia has “lost its soul” and been “reduced to just another generic Chinese marketplace,” a Jakarta-based seller wrote in a LinkedIn post. “There’s nothing wrong with that on paper, but the truth is, Indonesians shop differently. We look for connection, for trust, for the sense that we’re part of something local and meaningful.”\n\n— restofworld.org, July 2025\n\nIn the UK, TikTok Shop has had massive organizational and leadership problems and had to rebuild the organization several times since 2021:\n\nA culture clash between TikTok’s Chinese owners and some of its London employees has triggered a staff exodus and complaints about an aggressive corporate ethos that runs counter to typical working practices in the UK.\n\nThe friction has centred on the social media company’s ecommerce initiative, TikTok Shop, which launched in the UK in October. Joshua Ma, a senior executive at China’s ByteDance — owner of the viral video app — and the head of ecommerce at TikTok Europe, outraged London-based staff at a dinner this year when he said that, as a “capitalist”, he “didn’t believe” companies should offer maternity leave.\n\nThe episode is emblematic of a broader clash within the ecommerce division. At least 20 members of the London ecommerce team — around half of all its original staff — have left since TikTok Shop’s launch, while others say they are on the brink of quitting. Two employees have been paid settlements over working conditions.\n\n“There are people leaving every week, it is like a game — every Monday we ask who has been fired, who has quit,” one current employee said.\n\n— FT, June 2022\n\nThis is essentially four lost years and billions in investment burned because ByteDance wanted to move fast. In 2025, TikTok Shop has been re-launched in beta in the UK:\n\nAlthough the launch of TikTok Shop bodes well for business on paper, in practice its launch could be significantly more complicated.\n\nThis isn’t TikTok’s first ride in the rodeo of social commerce, after all. Culture clashes between TikTok’s Chinese owners and London staff tainted TikTok Shop’s UK launch in 2021.\n\nReports of burnout and tension between staff and former TikTok head of ecommerce Europe, Joshua Ma, led to an exodus of more than 20 members from the London team.\n\nThis rocky start was followed by a lack of traction, with the Shop operating at a loss and many live streams generating zero sales.\n\n— startups.co.uk, June 2025\n\nAn overall review of TikTok Shop’s on-going struggles in various markets can be found at Toutiao:\n\nA TikTok employee told Caijing Tianxia Weekly that Chinese nationals working overseas are mostly in technical roles, which typically involve a relatively stable and flexible pace. Given their familiarity with ByteDance’s work model, they generally adapt well to TikTok’s environment. However, TikTok Shop—a fledgling e-commerce division under significant revenue pressure—demands much higher work intensity. Since this department relies heavily on local operational talent, clashes inevitably arose.\n\nThis incident is merely one facet of the broader cultural conflicts TikTok faces overseas. Many perceive TikTok’s e-commerce expansion as aggressively “wild-growing,” yet it continually struggles with localization—a challenge common to all Chinese tech companies going global.\n\n…\n\nAs ByteDance’s primary vehicle for global expansion, TikTok has made significant inroads in numerous markets. However, managing dispersed teams across the US, UK, Japan, Brazil, Germany, Singapore, and elsewhere inevitably presents complex challenges.\n\nAJ (a pseudonym), a research and development engineer at TikTok’s US office, told Caijing Tianxia Weekly that in his R&D team, 70% of employees are of Chinese descent. Since TikTok evolved from Musical.ly—a Shanghai-based company—much of the inherited code documentation remains in Chinese, creating language barriers for foreign staff.\n\n…\n\nAJ believes this is nearly impossible at TikTok. In his R&D team, managers (mostly of Chinese descent) oversee 30–40 people each—a ratio “unimaginable in the US,” where frontline managers typically supervise only 5–6 individuals (only senior managers handle 30–40).\n\nFurther problems caused by the single-minded focus on speed at TikTok Shop US can be read about in Special Submission | My Two and a Half Years at ByteDance E-Commerce in the U.S.: From Hope to Disillusionment which was written by a Chinese engineer.\n\nLet’s list all the numerous problems it has created:\n\nStrategy — ByteDance assumes that live commerce, which shows promising signs in China but is by far not proven as a new model of e-commerce instead of a niche, will work in other locales. They have not done the work to prove the model, but simply chose the path of replicating exactly what they did in China, and doing so quickly.\nIn reality, live commerce has existed since at least the 1990s, most notably with QVC, and has only ever been a minor share of retail. It suits only a minor segment of customers, and only fits promotion-driven companies and most often low-cost products.Organization - Most employees, even Chinese transplants, leave after a year or two, and foreign employees rarely last a year. They have had to rebuild the organization multiple times in each locale.Partner relationships - Sellers that have worked with TikTok Shop swear to never do so again, due to how hard they were pushed, how poorly they were treated, and how much money they lost.Revenue - Every year, in each locale, TikTok Shop significantly underperforms its set goals. You may say that maybe they just set aggressive goals — but if you set goals that everyone knows cannot be met, then there are no goals, and without goals there can be no strategy. And that is exactly right: TikTok Shop is a flailing operation without strategy, for which a singular focus on doing things quickly has been replaced.\n\nThis is why Chinese teams have 30-40 team members, why leaders are too overwhelmed to think strategically, why people leave quickly, why people have to work 996 but accomplish less than 965, why being “data-driven” is nonsense when you are only looking at A/B tests of random, guess-work features and traffic that may go up due to promotion-driven campaigns, while the house is on fire.\n\nWhat did DJI and Insta360 do differently to become the first Chinese, global category leaders in drones, gimbals and cameras?\n\nThey built separate organizations for China and International markets, they hired people with experience and knowledge of the markets inside China HQ and outside of China in the regional offices, and based on these capabilities they created strategies for their respective markets. They never brought leaders from the China market to copy paste tactics that worked in China, and they never sent people who couldn’t speak English to lead their international offices. As a result, they have the strongest brands and the best products on the market.\n\nSo, as a summary, the productive type of speed is not a strategy and it is not an organizational value. Speed is an outcome from building an organization and an environment to operate in that makes resources accessible. Whenever speed itself is used as a strategy, it is the destructive type of speed that is being used. And whenever speed is used instead of strategy and proper organizational design, it is because leadership has abdicated its responsibility to do exactly these things.",

The worst offender was a pop-up toaster, which without any bread inside it, gave off around 1.73 trillion UFPs per minute.\n\nWhile the potential effects on human health weren't directly measured in this study, simulations run by the team showed that the UFPs would be too fine for the nose to filter them out, allowing them to penetrate deep into the lungs of adults and children. With their smaller airways, children could be most at risk from these particles sticking around.\n\n\"Our study emphasizes the need for emission-aware electric appliance design and age-specific indoor air quality guidelines,\" says Changhyuk Kim, an environmental engineer from PNU.\n\n\"In the long term, reducing UFP emissions from everyday devices will contribute to healthier indoor environments and lower chronic exposure risks, particularly for young children.\"\n\nElectric heating coils and brushed DC motors in the devices seemed to play a large role in UFP emission. The brushless hair dryers tested emitted some 10 to 100 times fewer particles than the hair dryers with motors inside.\n\nWhat's more, as well as the UFPs, the researchers found evidence of heavy metals – copper, iron, aluminum, silver, and titanium – in the airborne particles too. It seems these metals are most likely coming off the coils and motors directly.\n\n\"These associated heavy metals increase the risk of cytotoxicity and inflammation when the particles enter the human body,\" says Kim.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that this study didn't test the potential health impacts of these appliances and the UFPs they produce – but plenty of prior research has done that, and the findings aren't promising.\n\nThese particles have been linked to conditions including asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer.\n\nAn increasing amount of research is now looking at problems with indoor air quality, whether that comes from appliances, deodorants, or hairsprays. With a warming climate and a global pandemic, many of us are now tending to spend more of our time indoors than we ever have.\n\nThe researchers want to see more done to improve the safety of home appliances, and the level of UFP emissions they give off – a problem starkly highlighted in this study. Design and efficiency improvements can be put in place by manufacturers, but it's likely that tighter regulations will be required to enact change.\n\n\"Understanding the source of the pollutants helps to develop preventive measures and policies for keeping healthy indoor air quality,\" says Kim.\n\nThe research has been published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Special thanks to Zachary Williamson, Afra Wang, Mark Lutter,\nBalaji Srinivasan and Primavera di Filippi for feedback and\nreview\n\nOne of the recurring ideological themes of the last few decades has\nbeen the idea of creating entire new communities, cultures, cities and\neven countries. Instead of having a fixed number of these, all slowly\nchanging, we can \"let a thousand\nnations bloom\" (where \"nation\" can cover the full spectrum from a\nglorified internet forum to a literal country), giving people more\nchoice and opening up space for more pluralistic independent innovation.\nInstead of your membership in one being an accident of birth, each\nperson can choose to gravitate to the communities that best fit their\nvalues.\n\nThese ideas are diverse. Some of them are explicitly about getting as\nmuch legal autonomy as possible, and using that platform to create new\nlaws from the ground up. Others value a more gradualist approach, and a\nmore long-term closer connection to existing groups and institutions\nrather than re-building everything from zero. Some focus on countries,\nothers on cities, and others on cultures. Some are more left-leaning in\nideology, others are more right-leaning. In many ways, it's like where\nthe crypto space was five to ten years ago.\n\nLeft: magic internet money. Right: magic internet\nsociety.\n\nIn 2023, seeing all of these ideas mature inspired me to run Zuzalu,\nan experimental \"popup city\" in Montenegro: bring ~200 people, from\nmultiple communities - Ethereum, longevity, rationalism, AI - together\nin one place for two months, and see what happens. Zuzalu succeeded as\nan experiment, and in my visits to various other \"new city\" projects I\noften heard the feedback that it inspired them to take culture and\ncommunity building more seriously. But the experiment left unanswered a\nkey question: what happens next?\n\nIn this post, I give my updated picture of this space. I will first\nreview what I think we have learned since 2023, when the space moved\nfrom vibes and whitepapers to real-world experimentation. I will then\nsketch out a concrete world that this movement could be driving towards,\nwhat new types of entities will emerge, and what concrete value they can\nprovide.\n\nZuzalu in 2023 was an experiment: bring ~200 people, from multiple\ncommunities -Ethereum, longevity, rationalism, AI - together in one\nplace for two months, and see what happens. This was the first time\nsomething like this had happened in this way - almost all events are\neither much smaller in scale, much shorter, or both - and the closest\nother historical examples are in spheres far removed from the kind of\nfrontier technology that Zuzalu was built around.\n\nI enjoyed my experience at Zuzalu - though sometimes the\nsocialization did get to the point where it was too much for me. I\nlearned a lot about different people's interests, and got to know many\nwarm and friendly and interesting people. There are a lot of \"little\nthings\" that we learned about how to organize a popup well. For\nexample:\n\nAfter the original Zuzalu in Montenegro, we kept going organizing\n\"popups\", and it feels like popups seem to have found \"product market\nfit\" within their niche. One of the Zu spinoffs, Edge City, has perfected a\npipeline of organizing them, and I have heard that they are at this\npoint a cash-flow-positive business. And popups - like-minded people\nliving together for medium durations - have proven themselves as a\nstepping stone toward a more full-fledged community.\n\nA panel on cryptography at ZuConnect and the ZuSocial hacker\nhouse, Istanbul 2023.\n\nIt also became abundantly clear that there are limits to what popups\ncan do:\n\nAnother pattern I have noticed is that two things core to the\nearly ideology often fall away over time: novel governance designs, and\na search for legal autonomy. Within the context of popups, this\nmakes total sense. If a popup is short-duration, then \"forking as\ngovernance\" works perfectly fine. Each popup can be run by a founder or\ncore team, and if anyone is unhappy, they can make their own version and\ntry to attract people over. The longevity-focused Zu spinoff Vitalia\nalready split\ninto two forks. And if a popup only lasts 30 days, then there is not\nmuch interesting that could be done that would benefit from legal\ninnovation.\n\nAs a result of all this, I have noticed a worrying pattern: over\ntime, popups would get shorter in duration, smaller in scope, and more\ngeneric in substance, to the point where in the limit they approach\nbeing simply a few more conferences and hackerspaces. Outside the\nZuzalu-verse, I saw Praxis aspiring to big\ndreams of a new Mediterranean renaissance, but in practice mostly\ndelivering parties in upscale cities in the United States. (Since then,\nthey seem to have switched\nto pursuing the American military dynamism topic)\n\nFor all of these reasons, I have started advocating for\nZuzalu-inspired communities to start having permanent nodes. There\nalready are a few: Frontier\nTower, Crecimiento, and\n4seas' two nodes (one city, one\nmountain) in Chiang Mai, with others under construction\n(additionally, of course, there is Balaji's Network School). But even with these, in the\nback of my mind I always fear the \"regression to the mean\" that they\nwill turn into glorified coworkingspaces, and lose all of their cultural\nor experimental interestingness. Making sure that this does not happen\nis an ongoing challenge, and indeed it is a primary goal of this post to\npaint a clearer picture of what alternative future these projects could\nbe driving toward.\n\nNow, let's get into actually explaining what I think this future can\nbe.\n\nThe 4seas mountain venue features flags of many of the\ncommunities that it sees itself as connected with: Bitcoin,\nEthereum, Plancker, 706\n\nOne common critique of modern society is that it is at the same time\natomistic and authoritarian: there is a lack of intermediate\ninstitutions, in between individuals and states, that give people needed\nservices and community. In the critics' story, this makes society:\n\nAll three problems stem from the fact that we have too much of a\ntwo-level structure: individuals, very powerful large-scale actors like\nstates, and nothing else.\n\nHistorically, these \"intermediate institutions\" included local\ngovernments, clubs, churches, small businesses and various other\nassociations. Today, we still have many of those, but they are\ninherently local in scale, and so they are failing to capture the most\nmeaningful communities today, which are increasingly continental and\nglobal. We have corporations, including very big corporations, and we\nalso have social media. But these are impersonal, homogenizing forces:\nthe profit motive drives them to appeal to as many people as possible,\nreducing their diversity and uniqueness toward zero. Startups are small\nand diverse, but according to the\nstandard playbook, encouraged by venture-capital profit motives, a\nstartup is a group of people attempting to become a new megacorporation,\nnot some reliable third sector of society.\n\nSo what would a successful \"intermediate institution\" of this type,\nadapted for the needs of the 21ˢᵗ century, look like? I will propose my\nanswer. It needs to be some kind of neo-tribe or other\ninstitution that focuses, and meaningfully innovates, on the thing that\nhumans do that isn't generic: culture.\n\nLeft: gym at Balaji's Network\nSchool. Right: Town hall at ShanhaiWoo Chiang\nMai.\n\nThe Wiktionary\ndefinition of \"culture\" begins as follows:\n\nIn short, culture is the patterns of human behavior in a particular\ncommunity. It covers everything from the food you eat, the language you\nspeak, dance, music, architecture, to much \"deeper\" things like how\npeople conceive the stories of their own lives, their relationships with\ntheir families, business, politics, and how people resolve conflicts in\nall of these spheres.\n\nMany people make the mistake of thinking culture is something that\ncan be explicitly laid down by mission statements and top-down edicts.\nLet's take, for example, the corporate culture of Enron (explanation for\nyounger readers: Enron was the FTX of your parents'\nera).\n\nOn paper, Enron valued \"integrity, communication, respect and\nexcellence\". In practice, Enron clearly valued some very different\nthings. But this is only the most egregious example; the inevitable wide\ndivergence between \"organizational culture\" written on paper and an\norganization's culture in practice is very easy to see anywhere.\n\nAnother problem with top-down attempts to shape culture, especially\nmore coercive ones, is that the whole strategy has very low galaxy-brain\nresistance. While declaring top-down \"the culture I wrote down in\nthis document is better than what you have now, so I will impose it\" may\nat times be the right thing to do (see: the anti-smoking push,\nfederally-driven anti-segregation\nin the 1960s USA, etc), the problem is that it's too easy for\nsomeone to get convinced that their own culture, as they understand it,\nis great, and then use it as an excuse to dominate others.\n\nOn the other hand, many people make the mistake of over-identifying\nculture with the purely aesthetic, subjective and\ngroup-identity-oriented parts of culture: food, music, dance, dress,\narchitecture styles, and ignore the parts that are functional, whose\nsuccess or failure drives the success and failure of civilizations. This\ncan lead to an over-egalitarian and stagnant \"culture as museum\"\nmentality: every culture is equally as good as every other culture\nbecause aesthetics are ultimately subjective, and so there is no such\nthing as cultural improvement - instead, the only goal is\npreservation.\n\nThat is the sort of thing that Thomas Sowell rails\nagainst:\n\nCultures are not museum pieces. They are the working machinery of\neveryday life. Unlike objects of aesthetic contemplation, working\nmachinery is judged by how well it works, compared to the\nalternatives.\n\nCultures are there to serve their people, not touristic onlookers\nappreciating their existence from far away. Some cultures do this much\nbetter than others, and all cultures could do much better still. There\nare just too many examples of traditional culture being pathological\n(here's the latest\nI just happened to see while writing this) for preservation to be\nthe only goal. And even if it were not, technology - growing wealth,\ndigital communications, birth control, education, the list goes on - has\nchanged the world so much that any lessons from our collective memory in\nthe past millennium need to be radically adapted to be relevant in the\nnext.\n\nOn the third hand, some make the mistake of acknowledging that\nculture is functional, but over-emphasizing very small-scale\nindividual decisions as a vehicle of change. This is what Scott\nAlexander calls \"universal\nculture\":\n\nUniversal culture is the collection of the most competitive ideas and\nproducts. Coca-Cola spreads because it tastes better than whatever\npeople were drinking before. Egalitarian gender norms spread because\nthey're more popular and likeable than their predecessors. If there was\nsomething that outcompeted Coca-Cola, then that would be the official\nsoda of universal culture and Coca-Cola would be consigned to the\nscrapheap of history.\n\nInstead of keeping culture the way it is, or reforming it from the\ntop down, why not embrace the wisdom of accumulated individual choice\nand freedom?\n\nHere is how I would argue the case against an overly purist version\nof this approach. There are many things that require \"immersion\" to\nsucceed: lifestyle habits, local public goods such as air quality, work\nhabits, lifetime learning habits, limitations on use of technology, etc.\nDoing anything truly interesting and unique requires \"depth\", and\nsubstantial collective investment and effort to create an entire\nenvironment oriented around better serving those needs. These things\ncannot easily be done by an individual, or even by a corporation,\nbecause corporations face too much pressure to \"meet users where they\nare\" - and so we get everyone drinking Coca Cola (or getting addicted to\noutrage-driven social media, or ...)\n\nAs we see clearly with architecture styles (but happens in every\nsphere), relying too much on market incentives leads to global\nmonoculture.\n\nSo what's going on here? And if we want to avoid these three\npitfalls, what might cultural evolution done well look like?\n\nThe social philosopher Charles\nTaylor talks about culture as being underpinned by moral\norders and social imaginaries. Taylor defines\na \"social imaginary\" as:\n\nthe ways in which [people] imagine their social existence, how they\nfit together with others, how things go on between them and their\nfellows, the expectations which are normally met, and the deeper\nnormative notions and images which underlie these expectations\n\nTake our practice of choosing governments through general elections ...\nEssential to our understanding what is involved in this kind of\nmacro-decision is our ability to identify what would constitute a foul:\ncertain kinds of influence, buying votes, threats, and the like. This\nkind of macro-decision has, in other words, to meet certain norms, if it\nis to be what it is meant to be ... And beyond the ideal stands some\nnotion of a moral or metaphysical order, in the context of which the\nnorms and ideals make sense.\n\nAn important point that Taylor makes is that social imaginaries are\noften transformed when \"what start off as theories held by a few people\nmay come to infiltrate the social imaginary, first of elites perhaps,\nand then of the whole society\". Taylor talks at length about how modern\nEuropean liberal democratic norms emerged in the 17ᵗʰ century as a\nresult of this process transforming the European \"moral order\". However,\nTaylor cautions, this process of transformation is\norganic and complicated:\n\nWhat exactly is involved when a theory penetrates and transforms the\nsocial imaginary? For the most part, people take up, improvise, or are\ninducted into new practices. These are made sense of by the new outlook,\nthe one first articulated in the theory; this outlook is the context\nthat gives sense to the practices ... But this process isn't just one\nsides, a theory making over a social imaginary. In coming to make sense\nof the action the theory is glossed, as it were, given a particular\nshape as the context of these practices ... Nor need the process end here.\nThe new practice, with the implicit understanding it generates, can be\nthe basis for modifications of theory, which in turn can inflect\npractice, and so on.\n\nIn short, culture is a big complicated blob where actions,\nconsequences, statements by leaders and theories by intellectuals all\ninfluence each other in every direction. If a culture\nofficially says to do one thing, but actually people\ndo something else, then the latter is more decisive. Culture is\nshaped by incentives, but then incentives are themselves implemented by\npeople, who are guided by culture. Culture is housed in a community,\nwhich is held together because people feel affinity for each other, and\nthat affinity is itself shaped by shared rituals.\n\nI remember experiencing some of this (ok fine, the solitary parts of\nthis) myself with my experiences as a teenager attempting to build constructed\nlanguages - like Esperanto, but\nbetter. I easily recognized how English is pathological with its horribly broken and irregular\nspelling system (and many other issues), and how centuries of\norganic evolution has only made the problem worse. But when I tried to\ncreate an \"ideal language\" from scratch, I ended up creating something\nthat can make beautiful logical and compact sentences in the specific\ncases I designed it around, but which takes three times longer than\nEnglish to express any other thought that I needed to express in\neveryday life.\n\nThis shows why all three of the above approaches to culture are\ninsufficient:\n\nNotice how \"top-down culture\", \"cultural traditionalism\" and\n\"cultural individualism\" map really nicely to the three corners of\n\"the\nd/acc triangle\", which also argues that all three are\ninsufficient and we need to do something else.\n\nAnd so I think we need a different path. What we want is a\nbetter \"world game\" for cultural evolution: an environment\nwhere cultures improve and compete, but not on the basis of violent\nforce, and also not exclusively on low-level forms of memetic\nfitness (eg. virality of individual posts on social media,\nmoment-by-moment enjoyment and convenience), but rather on some kind of\nfair playing field that creates sufficient space to showcase the\nlonger-term benefits that a thriving culture provides.\n\nOne early modern version of this idea is the notion of\n\"prefigurational cultures\". A seminal work is Margaret\nMead's Culture and Commitment from 1970:\n\nIn the past, in configurational cultures, the elderly were gradually\ncut off from limiting the future of their children. Now, as I see it,\nthe development of prefigurational cultures will depend on the existence\nof a continuing dialogue in which the young, free to act on their own\ninitiative, can lead their elders in the direction of the unknown.\n\nWhat might a prefigurational culture in the real world look like?\nHere, there are many possible different answers. To show one end of the\nspectrum, let me re-paste Balaji's example from years ago:\n\nStart with a history of the horrible USDA Food Pyramid, the\ngrain-heavy monstrosity that gave cover to the corporate sugarification\nof the globe and the obesity epidemic. ... Organize a community online\nthat crowdfunds properties around the world, like apartment buildings\nand gyms, and perhaps eventually even culdesacs and small towns. You\nmight take an extreme sugar teeotaler approach, literally banning\nprocessed foods and sugar at the border, thereby implementing a kind of\n\"Keto Kosher\".\n\nYou can imagine variants of this startup society that are like\n\"Carnivory Communities\" or \"Paleo People\". These would be competing\nstartup societies in the same broad area, iterations on a theme. If\nsuccessful, such a society might not stop at sugar. It could get into\nsetting cultural defaults for fitness and exercise. Or perhaps it could\nbulk purchase continuous glucose meters for all members, or orders of\nmetformin.\n\nBut cultural innovation does not have to be \"legible\" in the way that\nKeto Kosher is. In fact, as we have seen, over-indexing on legibility\nand on explicit ideology often leads to problems. Cultural innovation\nworks better when it arises out of a collection of habits, attitudes and\ngoals that are shared by a particular group, and adapted to the group's\nneeds. The group's goal might be realistically a 50/50 mix of being\n\"about a set of values\" and being \"about the group\" - it's not\nattempting to expand to unlimited size, rather, it's a group of people\nwith shared history and shared identity trying to do their thing and\nmake the best of it.\n\nThe Zuzalu-verse is actually one of the better proto-examples of\nthis. It is organized around a particular set of values: the \"Ethereum\ncanon\" of open source, freedom, decentralization and a positive-sum\nattitude toward humanity, idealistic hacker culture, concern about\nhealth, etc. The Zuzalu identity is demonstrably not universal. Many\npeople who frequent the Zuzalu-verse reported finding themselves out of\nplace at Network School, which is organized around principles that are\nsimilar on paper, but very different in their \"vibes\" - and undoubtedly\nothers feel the same way in the other direction. But there isn't a fixed\n\"One\nCommandment\", or even any specific written-down mission and vision\nstatement. Aspects of it could be described as \"Keto Kosher but for\neducation\", attempting to integrate constant learning into week-by-week\nlife (a very important thing for us to get right in the 21ˢᵗ century!),\nbut even this is done in a very organic style. Just as much as the\ngoals, the community is organized around its people.\n\nEventually, I also expect tribes to get back to innovating in\ngovernance: using a combination of culture and technological\nmeans (blockchains, LLMs, ZK...) to have better collective conversation\nand decision-making. Currently, this part of the space is in somewhat of\na \"trough of disillusionment\", as we have realized the downfalls of\nformalizing governance too early. However, I would argue that we have\nnot yet properly tried to integrate AI and ZK tech into voting\nprocesses, which could solve their two biggest problems: attention\noverload and fatigue, and collapse into social games where people vote\nbased on how their vote will be perceived (if not outright bribery),\nrather than their genuine convictions. I expect this to pick back up at\nsome point, as it will be necessary for tribes to be long-term\nsustainable without having the same pitfalls as corporations. I also\nthink tribes may be a better ground for this kind of governance\nexperimentation than eg. blockchain-based DAOs, because tribes'\ncapabilities and needs are more complex.\n\n4seas Nimman in Chiang Mai. Visibly a \"regen\" space, visibly an\n\"Ethereum-ish\" space, visibly not your average cowork.\n\nTruly instantiating a culture with any level of depth requires not\njust talking about the culture's themes, but actually\nliving them. This requires deep immersion,\ninstantiating the culture's values and aesthetics and practices at a\nlevel that goes far beyond a few decorations and posters. For\nexample:\n\nThis is all why I think it is a critical part of digital tribes to\nhave long-lasting physical spaces. Physical spaces allow a culture's\nvalues and habits to be instantiated in a much deeper way.\n\nThe good news about a hub is that you need a surprisingly small size\nto be viable. If a hub is located inside a city, they can be arbitrarily\nsmall, because residents can take advantage of the surrounding\ninfrastructure of a city. If a hub is located outside a city, then it's\nbasically building a new city. But even here, there is good news. For a\nconventional city to play a significant role at the frontier of\nanything, you need to have a population of at least a million; that is\nthe level at which it's possible to have effective network effects\nwithin any particular niche. But if you are specialized to one or a few\nniches (I think a novel combination of a few niches is better than being\noverly focused on one), the minimum size is much smaller. Here are some\nexamples of viable cities I've visited that are quite small:\n\n2,600 is a great size: Longyearbyen is able to sustain ~10\nrestaurants, an airport, a hospital and a school (2,600 total ~= 26 per\nyear of age).\n\nBut 100 people is probably not enough. I recently visited Prospera in\nHonduras (population ~100), and while the physical venue was beautiful,\nsurprisingly strong on cultural uniqueness, and even strong on\nengagement with locals (a Honduran was on the core leadership team, many\nwere in the core community, and at least one of the medical businesses\nwas run by Hondurans), the place I was staying had one restaurant with\nlimited food options and no other amenities within walking distance.\nHence I think one or two further steps of growth and maturity beyond the\n100-person level is ideal.\n\nI expect getting hubs right to be the next important step for these\nkinds of \"tribes\" to succeed, and an important training ground for them\nto figure out culture, governance and other issues at a much deeper\nlevel.\n\nFrom top left to bottom right: (i) the micronation Liberland,\n(ii) Prospera,\na zone in Honduras, (iii) artist's drawing of the\nunder-construction California\nForever, (iv) artist's drawing of Bhutan's\ngovernment-initiated under-construction Gelephu Mindfulness City. All\nare what I call \"zones\", but represent very different points on the\nspectrum of engagement with governments.\n\nFrom top left to bottom right: (i) the micronation Liberland,\n(ii) Prospera,\na zone in Honduras, (iii) artist's drawing of the\nunder-construction California\nForever, (iv) artist's drawing of Bhutan's\ngovernment-initiated under-construction Gelephu Mindfulness City. All\nare what I call \"zones\", but represent very different points on the\nspectrum of engagement with governments.\n\nSo far, we have talked about innovating in culture. The more\nradical part of the free cities and network states space started by\nasking a different question: how do we get more innovation in\nrules - that is, the regulations, laws, and political systems\nthat govern the physical spaces that we are in?\n\nIn my observation, there are three schools of thought here:\n\nOne\nview of a social technology perspective on\ngovernance.\n\nOften, the three perspectives merge. Some social technologists are\ninterested in governance ideas in a libertarian-ish direction, because\nthey see ideal forms of governance is being precisely those forms that\ntry to align incentives and beyond that point minimize arbitrary\nconstraints. Some libertarians believe in freedom because they see it as\ncritical for economic development.\n\nMy attempt at creating a political compass of some of the\nprojects I am more familiar with.\n\nBasically, for a country, it's a way of participating in the rapid\nand accelerating economic and technological revolution of the 21ˢᵗ\ncentury. In particular, it lets you go beyond tourism, which imports\nindividuals but not the networks between those\nindividuals, and instead actually import parts of the networks\nthemselves, opening up the opportunity to capture a larger share of the\nvalue.\n\nUnder British rule, and then for the first two decades of Chinese\nrule, Hong Kong served as a crucial entrepot — the\nworld's gateway to China. It facilitated the inflow of foreign capital,\nwhich was absolutely crucial to China's early industrialization. It was\na major hub for goods to move into and out of China. It provided\nservices for foreigners to do business on the mainland. And it imported\nforeign know-how into China, teaching locals how to build high-quality\ninfrastructure, set up factories, and do business overseas.\n\nSo I thought about Hong Kong, and wondered: What if every\ncountry had a quasi-independent city like that?\n\nImagine a Hong Kong in India. A Hong Kong or two in Europe. A Hong\nKong in Brazil, Japan, Indonesia, the United States, and so on. Each\ncity would formally be a part of the host country, subject to the laws\nand authority of the central government there. But in practice, each\ncity would be granted a degree of autonomy.\n\nThis sounds like social science fiction, but Bhutan's Gelephu Mindfulness City is an attempt to do\npretty much exactly this. The problem that GMC is trying to solve is, as\ndescribed to me by the Bhutan government, is twofold:\n\nBasically, let the expats come and the thirty-storey towers go up, at\nleast in one corner of the country along the border with India, but\ndon't let the next generation of the whole country get hooked on Coca\nCola.\n\nIncidentally, this is all why I am expecting \"zones\" to be the bulk\nof the future of jurisdictional innovation, and not new \"countries\".\nCountries are very unwilling to literally give up their sovereignty over\neven small patches of their land. Liberland has found a hack: take over\none of the very small pieces of land that, by pure accident of how the\nlines were drawn, no country claims as its own. But there are\nnot many opportunities like that, and even that is far\nfrom a guarantee of safety. To really have a country, you\nhave to either get approval from your new neighbors, or figure out your\nown military. Zones, on the other hand, are much more palatable for\npoliticians, and also enable a government to actually get ongoing upside\nin the networks that it attracts, rather than just a one-time deal (eg.\nProspera pays 12% of its tax revenue to the government of Honduras).\n\nI will give a few examples that I personally find interesting, on a\nscale from \"boring\" to \"experimental\".\n\nIn many developed countries, a major challenge is that housing\nconstruction is very difficult for legal reasons. Some have estimated\nthat fixing this could make cities much more affordable, and improve\nGDP by as much as 36%. But changing laws in an existing city is\nhard, in large part because of existing stakeholders. So what if you can\ncreate a new city?\n\nThis is a big part of the\npitch for California\nForever. The other part of the pitch is all the other problems that\nurban economists have consistently railed about for decades. One that\nCalifornia Forever, and others like Culdesac, focus on is walkability (and\nbikeability). A third is attracting business including heavy industry\nthat people can work in. A fourth and more experimental option is\nfriendliness to new technologies (eg. drone delivery). There is a whole\nlist of ideas that policy thinkers have basically agreed on for decades,\nthat many are frustrated that they cannot implement in existing cities\nbecause things are hard to change. With a new city, you can - and it\nonly requires city-level autonomy, which is in many places quite easy to\nget, and not anything national-scale.\n\nLeft: where a Singaporean can go (for short-term visit) without a\nvisa. Right: where an Indian can go without a visa.\n\nOne problem that many people have in the 21ˢᵗ century: where do you\ngo to live? Whether it's because of lack of economic opportunity,\npolitical instability, a culture unforgiving to people who are\ndifferent, or a government unfriendly to their business aspirations or\neven their way of life (or, for the luckier among us, a simple thirst\nfor adventure), for many people around the world, the country of their\nbirth does not suit them.\n\nAttracting these people is a massive economic opportunity. Many\ncountries around the world are becoming more restrictive (or even\nhostile) to both long-term and short-term immigration, but the number of\npeople who need more options for where to be is only increasing. Better\nserving such people also fosters global redistribution of\ntalent: creating a future where the most important\ntechnological and economic work is done from everywhere, and its\nproceeds more widely shared, instead of being concentrated in a few\nsuperstar cities in a few very powerful countries.\n\nThere is also a social technology angle to this. Many people have\nconcerns about inviting more people: the risk that they will stay longer\nthan expected and become illegal immigrants (including running to\nneighboring countries), risks related to safety, cultural\nincompatibility, etc. Today, we use \"which country are you from?\" as a\nfilter to determine who is high-risk and who is low-risk. But this is\nincredibly inefficient and unjust - it's the exact opposite of \"judging\npeople not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their\ncharacter\". In a modern digitized society, we have many kinds of filters\nto identify people who might be low-risk: work history, education,\npeople vouching for them, etc. I expect that whichever country or zone\ncreates an easy user-friendly mechanism for talented people from\neverywhere to easily be able to come (eg. to work for a local company,\nor for a conference, or for a popup) will gain a lot of benefits.\n\nOne idea that some economists like Robin Hanson support as a\nsubstitute for much of our regulation is vouching\n(aka mandatory liability insurance): you can do what you want, as\nlong as you find someone (eg. an insurance company) with enough capital\nwho agrees to pay potentially large fines and compensate any victims if\nyou create a problem.\n\nThis addresses a key problem with a libertarian approach to law: if\nyou only punish people when they actually create a problem, then the\ncost of the harm can easily be so great that there's no way to penalize\nsomeone enough to adequately incentivize caution. If the only regulation\non driving were that if you cause an accident you go to jail, it would\ndeter drunk driving (or driving without a license, or flying in unsafe\nversions of weird newfangled 3D aircraft) too little.\n\nIt also addresses a problem with the current approach of creating\napplication-specific rules for everything: the rules do not adapt well\nto new technology, and easily get corrupted and twisted into goals that\nhave nothing to do with safety, like protecting incumbent businesses.\nHere, the rules that people follow would be created by vouchers,\nincentivized by their need to balance between attracting customers and\nmanaging risks, rather than by politicians. The political lever is\nindirect, and more compatible with a free society: it sets the\nobjective, but not how you get there.\n\nIf successful, this is a really cool idea that could improve a lot of\nthings. But to see if it works, we have to try it somewhere, at a\nsufficient scale and level of realism. This is actually what Prospera,\nthe autonomous zone in Honduras (see website, review by\nScott Alexander) is trying to do. Currently, the experiment is still\nvery young, and there is only one insurance company (run by the zone\nitself), but this is exactly the kind of thing that a self-contained\nzone is the ideal place to try.\n\nOne of the core political challenges of the 21ˢᵗ century is how to\nimprove democracy. Here's Eliezer Yudkowsky way of stating the\nproblem:\n\nEliezer's proposed\nsolution is a new twist on liquid\ndemocracy. Approximately:\n\nAgain, this is a really cool idea: it biases for sophistication\n(because each level would end up more sophisticated than the previous)\nand guards against populism (because a delegate can't amass extreme\npower by gaining a huge following directly) but in a way that avoids\nempowering pre-selected aristocracies. But to see how well it works, we\nneed to try it somewhere.\n\nAgain, you don't have to believe in this exact idea, just that there\nare things of this level of craziness that are at least worthy trying in\na serious way, somewhere.\n\nProjects building zones, especially those leaning more libertarian or\nnot initiated by governments, often get criticized - for being havens\nfor billionaires, unregulated zones where things will inevitably go very\nwrong, or for being neo-colonial. These criticisms sometimes apply to\ntribes and hubs too. I can understand the sentiment behind these\ncritiques, and I think there are important risks worth worrying about.\nHowever, I disagree with many of the stronger criticisms\n- and it is worth explaining why.\n\nAt heart, I am a pluralist. I believe that when different people\ndisagree about how things should be done, it's healthy to have a bias\ntoward solutions where both versions exist at least somewhere, and\npeople can freely choose between them. If a powerful (commercial or\npolitical or cultural) actor wants to see their culture or economic or\npolitical ideology implemented, the most productive and least risky\nimaginable way for them to do it is to peacefully make something\nsmall in a corner somewhere, and see how it plays out. By building a\nwhole new zone from scratch, you are taking on a huge inconvenience, and\na huge tax in terms of forgoing all kinds of network effects. And since\nyou are growing not by amassing a country-sized blog or podcast\naudience, but instead entering the real world at a much earlier stage,\nwe all gain valuable rapid feedback about whether or not the whole idea\nis crazy. This all feels like the sort of role you want\nsemi-influential radical mavericks to be playing in our society.\n\nWhat's the role we don't want them to play? One strategy I\ndeeply fear is what many in the so-called Silicon\nValley Tech Right have recently pivoted to: stop trying to route\naround the government, and instead just take over the government.\nThis is deeply scary: instead of corporations and the state serving as a\nhealthy check and balance against each other, the two collude against\neveryone else. It also means that ideas go straight from being\ntwelve-thousand-word screeds or five hour podcasts to running entire\ncountries.\n\nAnd in my experience, these two modes of action are substitutes:\npeople who start working on tribes and zones suddenly get visibly\nmore positive-sum and less interested in country\ntakeovers.\n\nLots of people on the internet lately seem to pine for a world\n(or a nation) where we force everyone to be more like Durmstrang.\nI'd rather let someone enthusiastic about that approach make the best of\nit, and have to inspire people to come voluntarily, than pontificate on\nthe internet and build up a large political movement based on how\nappealing that idea sounds written in words, with no feedback from how\nit works in reality. Long small-scale voluntary attempts at Durmstrang,\nshort Gilead.\n\nLots of people on the internet lately seem to pine for a world\n(or a nation) where we force everyone to be more like Durmstrang.\nI'd rather let someone enthusiastic about that approach make the best of\nit, and have to inspire people to come voluntarily, than pontificate on\nthe internet and build up a large political movement based on how\nappealing that idea sounds written in words, with no feedback from how\nit works in reality. Long small-scale voluntary attempts at Durmstrang,\nshort Gilead.\n\nIn general, business and politics are the scariest at scale:\nmonopolizing industries, overwriting entire societies, or recklessly\nbuilding superintelligent AI (which eventually anyone will be able to\nbuild, but in any realistic universe the global centers of power will\nget to long before everyone else). Zones are the opposite of scale.\nWhatever you say about CHAZ,\nits downsides were far lower than what you would get if the\nsame people took over an entire country or even city government.\n\nIn an ideal world, zones can be a tool that can help countries and\nstates get more integrated into a global economy, and can give their\nbrightest people a path to frontier science and technology and business\nthat does not involve disappearing to a university and then a corporate\necosystem in a country halfway across the world. Creating opportunities\nfor frontier tech and business to happen locally instead of entirely\ndepending on powerful nations abroad can be a far more meaningful\ngain to national sovereignty than full uniformity of rules across\nthe entire country without even a few otherwise-undeveloped square\nkilometers of exceptions.\n\nBut achieving this outcome requires actively shaping it. I see\nopportunities for improvement here from both sides. Countries should not\nbe able to suddenly rugpull everyone in a zone if their political mood\nchanges, but they could have have levers of influence to\nencourage them to behave cooperatively, perhaps privileges defined\nnumerically that each administration can adjust up or down a medium\namount. Ideally, there would be ways to more explicitly encourage\neducation and tech transfer to local and regional talent. For\n\"developmentalist\" zones that are less radical but need to get access to\na larger local population, more limited sector-specific forms of\nautonomy is worth exploring.\n\nFrom a zone's perspective, this is another place where bottom-up\ndecentralized governance ideas can shine: they could help people working\non zones (or even hubs) are more able to determine what local\npopulations value and want, and try to proactively serve it, rather than\nwaiting for potential political backlash after the fact. Prospera has\nvoluntarily chosen to pay 12% of its taxes to the Honduran government,\nand passed internal laws to disallow it\nto expropriate anyone's land, but it could attempt to use newer\ntools to engage the population on a larger scale to better identify\nforms of value it could provide, and risks it should avoid.\n\nSo far, I have told two disjoint stories. One is about smaller-scale\ncommunity-driven projects, and experimentation in culture. Another is\nabout larger-scale politics and business-driven projects, and\nexperimentation in rules.\n\nIt may seem like the story I am going for is that the two will\nconverge. But actually, while some \"vertically integrated\" zones that\ncombine both will exist, I predict that in general the \"market\nstructure\" will split tribes and zones into distinct categories, because\nthese are different things that require different specialties that are\ncomplementary. Figuring out legal frameworks to make it easy\nfor people from any country around the world to come to one place is one\ntype of skill. Actually building a global community is another: Edge\nCity and ShanhaiWoo have access to great technical talent, but they are\nnot constitutional lawyers.\n\nWe have already seen this \"market structure\" in the Zuzalu world:\nthere is at least a partial separation between \"hubs\", which provide\npermanent space, and \"popups\", which are communities that sometimes need\nspace for some period of time. Network School, 4seas and other nodes\nregularly host popups inside of them. I expect collaboration between\nzones and tribes (including tribes that expand to permanent hubs) to\nfollow a similar pattern.\n\nI argue that this strategy is ideal for countries that want to\nmaximize the success of their zone. Their goal should not just be to\nimport individuals, rather it should be to import\nnetworks. Furthermore, because most of them cannot compete with\nthe world's largest cities at creating generic networks, they\nneed to focus on more focused issue-specific networks.\nAttracting tribes, including schemes like collective visas (the\ngovernment approves the tribe, the tribe then provides its list of\n100-1000 people who automatically get admitted), can be a very effective\nway of doing this.\n\nRecently, Francis Fukuyama wrote\na post arguing that \"liberalism needs community, but it doesn't need\na ‘strong god' telling everyone what to do\". Scott Alexander wrote\na piece commenting on it. Both are good, so I'll quote Scott quoting\nFukuyama and replying at length:\n\nAccording to R. R. Reno, editor of the magazine First\nThings, the liberal project of the past three generations has\nsought to weaken the \"strong\nGods\" of populism, nationalism, and religion that were held to be\nthe drivers of the bloody conflicts of the early 20th\ncentury. Those gods are now returning, and are present in the politics\nof both the progressive left and far right—particularly the right, which\nis characterized today by demands for strong national identities or\nreligious foundations for national communities.\n\nHowever, there is a cogent liberal response to the charge that\nliberalism undermines community. The problem is that, just as in the\n1930s, that response has not been adequately articulated by the\ndefenders of liberalism. Liberalism is not intrinsically opposed to\ncommunity; indeed, there is a version of liberalism that encourages the\nflourishing of strong community and human virtue. That community emerges\nthrough the development of a strong and well-organized civil society,\nwhere individuals freely choose to bond with other like-minded\nindividuals to seek common ends. People are free to follow \"strong\nGods\"; the only caveat is that there is no single strong god that binds\nthe entire society together.\n\nIn other words - yes, part of the good life is participation in a\ntight-knit community with strong values. Liberalism's shared values are\ncomparatively weak, and its knitting comparatively loose. But that's no\nargument against the liberal project. Its goal isn't to become this kind\nof community itself, but to be the platform where communities like this\ncan grow up. So in a liberal democracy, Christians can have their\nchurch, Jews their synagogue, Communists their commune, and so on.\nEveryone gets the tight-knit community they want - which beats\nilliberalism, where (at most) one group gets the community they\nwant and everyone else gets persecuted.\n\nOn a theoretical level, this is a great answer. On a practical level\n- is it really working? Are we really a nation dotted with tight-knit\ncommunities of strong values? The average person has a church they don't\nattend and a political philosophy that mainly cashes out in Twitter\ndunks. Otherwise they just consume whatever slop the current year's\nversion of capitalism chooses to throw at them.\n\nScott then lists a few partial exceptions, and laments that they have\nnot been much more successful. His conclusion is that it's not working\nyet because we're not wealthy enough, and when we get wealthier and\nmoving people around to custom communities with custom infrastructure\nbecomes cheaper, it will happen.\n\nBut I also think there is something different at play: people just\nhave to get off their butts and actually create these alternative\ncultures and environments, and doing it is hard. Startups are also hard.\nBut startups have had a multi-billion-pdollar capitalist optimization\nmachine figuring out all the most optimized ways of doing them and\nrapidly growing them to scale, and turned them into cookie-cutter\nstandardized playbooks. Culture does not have the same profit motive,\nand culture is inherently not easy to scale.\n\nSome argue that NFTs solve this and make culture profitable, but\nthe fact that Zundamon's\nTheorem was not made as an NFT makes me pessimistic that\nNFT-driven culture will solve the problems that I want cultural\ninnovation to solve.\n\nSome argue that NFTs solve this and make culture profitable, but\nthe fact that Zundamon's\nTheorem was not made as an NFT makes me pessimistic that\nNFT-driven culture will solve the problems that I want cultural\ninnovation to solve.\n\nA parallel problem exists for progress in economic and political\nrules, which have also stagnated under supposedly \"dynamic\" capitalist\nliberalism. The problem is that development of new and better economic\nand political rules, whether at city-scale or at country-scale,\nsimilarly does not have a strong profit motive. It definitely does not\nhave a rapid experimentation loop that startups have or even that many\n(but not all) aspects of culture have.\n\nI do not literally expect we are going to see a world where most\npeople live in tribes, or even zones. I definitely do not\nexpect normal people to be plotting themselves on a political compass of\n\"goldbug libertarianism\", \"hipster socialism\", \"Durmstrang-ism\",\n\"techno-Leninism\" etc, and joining whichever community is closest to\nthem on a 2D map. For most people, such grand ideologies are far from\nprimary in their lives. But I do expect a world that is somewhat more\ndynamic in both economic and political rules and in cultural dimensions,\nand that gives people more options.\n\nSuch a world would be a world where (i) people have more meaningful\nfreedom, both to escape persecution and to choose the kinds of\nenvironments that they truly enjoy living in, (ii) we get better\ninnovation both in economic and political rules and in culture, and\n(iii) instead of the innovation and creativity of the world being\nconcentrated in a few super-centers of global economic and political\npower, it is globally distributed everywhere across the world. This is a\nworld that I want to live in.",

    "title": "Interactive Fluid Typography",
    "description": "How to build responsive typography with fluid units and typed arithmetic in CSS.",
    "fullText": "What we call fluid typography are a set of tricks in CSS that allows to adapt the type size and leading when the screen size changes. So instead of having fixed breakpoints where the font-size abruptly, we want to have a smooth increase between different screen sizes, removing blind spots near the breakpoints where the font was disproportionally big or small.\n\nThe most basic implementation of fluid typography is to take a base size and a base screen width. If we divide the screen size (100vw) by the base size, we will have a ratio that will tell us how big is the screen related to the base size. Until recently, we had to take care in order not to multiply or divide two numbers with units, as this created an error. This has been solved in Chrome 140, creating exciting possibilities as outlined in this post by Amit Sheen, but support is still not baseline as I write this lines, so we will then just have to take care using unitless numbers for our base-screen-size and our base-font-size, in order to be able to operate with vw. This point is important and we'll come back to it later.\n\nWith this setup, we can have a text-size equal to 16px in our desired base-size that will grow and shrink linearlly with the size of our viewport. This has the obvious drawback that size will grow and shrink indefinetely, making it not very usable as it is. We could restrict that behaviour with @media-queries, setting it fluid between two breakpoints, and setting it fixed on the rest, but fortunately modern CSS allows to write this in a much more elegant way.\n\nWith clamp() function, we can directly set a minimum and maximum size and setting it fluid in between. This method is a good approach, and we could even set different type sizes taking the same value as base and multiplying this value by your favourite typographic ratio—like for example the Golden Ratio (1.618).\n\nHowever this method has the drawback that for small screens we generally want to set smaller jumps between our different typesizes, so ideally we would set a different typographic ratio. In order to do that we would have to create a breakpoint where all the types would change abruptly, making that part of the design a little bit junky. Also, it is not very obvious at between which viewport widths is the fluid part going to kick in.\n\nIn order to overcome this, Andy Bell points out in its phenomenal course Complete CSS a way to generate a typographic scale setting different ratios between screen sizes. So for example, we can create a scale for screens up until 400px that will have a 1.414 ratio, and then from screens from 400px to 1200px the ratio will increase the bigger the viewport, until a maximum of 1.618. In order to do that, we can use the values generated by Utopia website. As Utopia already generates the fluid values for each of our steps, we just have to generate then and paste them in our code.\n\nNow we are in control of everything, we can define the minimum and maximum sizes where our fluid typography will work, and we can also define a different scale for small viewports what will steadily grow—or shrink if that is desired—until reaching the scale we set for larger viewports. Also, it allows us to use rem instead of px, which should be considered a best practice for accesibility. This makes our typography fit and look harmonious in every screen size.\n\nHowever, there is a price we are paying, we're losing all control in our CSS, and each time we want to change our ratios, add and/or remove different steps or setting different screen limits, we will have to calculate back at Utopia's website and paste it in our code. Also, we lose the ability to try different values in our CSS and see them updated live in our browser.\n\nAs we introduced before, CSS Typed Arithmetic shipped in Chrome 140, allowing us “to write expressions in CSS such as calc(10em / 1px) or calc(20% / 0.5em * 1px)”. This small addition is crucial, as now we can change our unitless typographic ratio based on screen width. Taking as a base the slope formula that Utopia also uses, we will calculate a --screen-normalizer variable that will allow us to adjust both our font-size and our typographic-ratio to the viewport size withing our predefined bounds.\n\nThis opens a whole world of possibilities, as now we can easily switch between different type scales and sizes live from your console, which we find really handy for prototyping. Having all your spacing relative to just two measures makes it trivial to generate different additional type or space sizes when needed. In case I need a font size a half-step bigger or smaller than any of my current sizes, we just have to multiply or divide by the square root of my --fluid-step variable.\n\nAs of today, this is still just supported in Chrome, but we can start using it having Utopia generated classes as fallback using @supports rules.\n\nWhile already in the baseline support, CSS functions still don't support some mathematical functions as pow() or clamp(). When that time comes, it will be even easier to make font and space sizes on the fly, using just a function and a number that expresses the number of steps on your design system. For example, --fluid-size(2) could be used to get the size for the second step in the scale and work both for fonts and for spacing.\n\nMeanwhile, pressing the button below will open a menu that will let you play with all the typographic measures of this website, squizzing and expanding it as much as you like!",

    "title": "The Phone Ban Saved High School",
    "description": "Since the bell-to-bell device lockup, teens in New York have rediscovered the simple pleasures of conversation, board games, and poker.",
    "fullText": "When New York State banned phones in public schools from bell to bell this past September, the goal — according to the ban’s champion, Governor Hochul — was undistracted learning. But within weeks of the Great Phone Lockup, teachers began to notice an incidental (and arguably even more compelling) benefit: The teens were talking to one another as if they were in a Brat Pack movie. Sure, there’s been grumbling and some burner phones and scrolling in the bathroom. At one high school, an entrepreneurial senior even bought a pouch-unlocking magnet on Amazon and tried to charge classmates a dollar per jailbreak. But generally, with phones off-limits, the atmosphere feels different. There’s a pleasant buzz in the lunchroom, chatter in the hallways, and an alphabet of new analog hobbies popping up just about everywhere. “We’ve had a lot more school spirit,” says Rosalmi, a senior at New Heights Academy Charter School in Harlem. “People are more willing to do stuff.”\n\nWhat stuff are they doing? At many schools, teachers have made cards, board games, and sports equipment available during free time, and the kids have deigned to use them. Kevin Casado, a coach and teacher at Math, Engineering, and Science Academy Charter High School in Bushwick, hands out volleyballs every lunch period. He says a lot more kids are playing this year than were last year. “It’s no net, open space, forming their own circles of ten or 12 kids, hitting it up to each other, an equal number of girls and boys,” he adds. Aidan Amin, a ninth-grader at Hunter College High School, is in a friend group that congregates in the school foyer to stack OK Play tiles and compete at Sorry! and other tabletop games during lunch. “I’d say it’s made us closer. Honestly, half the people I’m playing board games with I didn’t know at all before this,” Aidan says.\n\nAt Rosalmi’s school, dominoes rule the cafeteria. “Dominoes is really a staple Dominican game. People get passionate. You have to slam that first piece down on the table!” she says, adding that there’s trash talk “but it’s game trash talk. It’s really funny.” About 11 miles south, at Brooklyn Technical High School, the name of the game is poker, the trash talk is (sometimes) in Russian, and instead of chips or cash, the kids bet with hair ties. Josh (not his real name), a junior there, says about half a dozen games go on during free periods. He tends to play Texas Hold’em with a group of friends he made this year. Their antics draw spectators and even side wagers: “We have one player who is probably the least skilled, but a lot of people bet on him because he has absurd luck,” he says. “He pulled our group’s first-of-the-year full house with pocket aces. He’s very entertaining.”\n\nOther students have discovered vintage technology like Game Boys and mp3 players. Alexei Kotov is a sophomore at Aviation High School in Queens. He bought a CD Walkman on Amazon last year, and since the phone ban started, he has been packing his dad’s old CDs — the Doors, Weezer — in his backpack. “My favorite one’s probably No Doubt’s Tragic Kingdom,” Alexei says. “I like the vocals. It’s, like, really emotional.” He shares his earbuds at lunch and swaps recommendations with friends. “One of them is really into Queen,” he says.\n\nNoshin Sayira is a junior at Stuyvesant High School, meaning she’s in the middle of the highest-pressure year at what may be one of the highest-pressure high schools in the country. She tells me that students’ top objection to the phone policy is that it’s become cumbersome to do homework between classes or to quickly study in the hallway before a test. But Noshin recently started printing out her study guides and has found that reviewing on paper actually works better: “I don’t get distracted by notifications,” she says. She and her friends have developed a stress-relieving free-period ritual: They sketch one another’s outfits. “One of my friends usually has supplies like colored pencils and proper paper,” she says.\n\nTokyo Levy, a seventh-grader at I.S. 318 in Williamsburg, is a discernibly different kid than he was in his phone-carrying days, at least according to his mother, Krystyna Printup, an art teacher at the Brooklyn School for Social Justice in Bushwick. “He was forced into the rapid learning and usage of technology during COVID when he had to attend school from home via Zoom,” she says. That led to a fixation on video and computer games — Minecraft, Clash Royale — then social media. “Now, his phone is no longer clutched by his side to run to after dinner or before bed. There have even been a couple days where he’s left his phone accidentally at home.” At school, after noticing kids gathered around chess boards during lunch, he decided to “I’ve always thought of people who played chess as really intelligent people. I see other people play, and it has really motivated me to try it out for myself,” he says. Participating in soccer in the schoolyard at recess inspired him to join a soccer league in his neighborhood, too.\n\nLately, he’s been bugging his parents not for a new video game or an upgraded phone but for a mainstay of their own childhoods: a bicycle. He wants to hang out with the new friends he’s made at school on the weekends.",

In his first stop in Philadelphia, he defended his tariffs and called the Democrats' criticism that his policies are driving up prices a \"hoax.\"\n\nTrump had also promised other checks in the past. He's floated such a $2,000 tariff dividend for every American below a certain income level, though congressional Republicans have balked at the idea.

So yeah, it's important to me to, like, show up with confidence,\" she said.\n\nDeschanel shares two children with her ex-husband, Jacob Pechenik. The pair split in 2019 after four years of marriage.\n\nThe actor said she's aware that Hollywood can be brutal to women when it comes to their appearance, but says she tries not to let that kind of commentary affect her.\n\nWhat's important is having a strong sense of self, she said.\n\n\"My identity was never super wrapped up in my appearance. I always made an effort to be like, what I'm presenting is more about my style and like, artistic and creative expressions versus, 'Oh, like I'm so just naturally perfect,'\" Deschanel said.\n\n\"All those things are so ephemeral and, you know, they change, and they're subjective.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, a move that is sure to infuriate China.\n\nThe State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump’s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China’s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.\n\nThe eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nOther sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.\n\nIn separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”\n\n“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.\n\nUnder federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain “sufficient self-defense capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.\n\nThe arms sales comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.\n\nTaiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.\n\nThe U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.\n\nLast week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor.\n\n“The bill has kept playing up the ‘China threat’ narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China’s sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,” Beijing’s embassy in Washington said after the legislation passed the House.\n\n“China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,” it said.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing. AP video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend and longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell asked a federal judge on Wednesday to set aside her sex trafficking conviction and free her from a 20-year prison sentence, saying “substantial new evidence” has emerged proving that constitutional violations spoiled her trial.\n\nMaxwell maintained in a habeas petition she has promised to file since August that information that would have resulted in her exoneration at her 2021 trial was withheld and false testimony was presented to the jury.\n\nShe said the cumulative effect of the constitutional violations resulted in a “complete miscarriage of justice.”\n\nA habeas petition (or writ of habeas corpus petition) is a legal request for a court to review the legality of someone’s detention, demanding that the custodian (like a prison official) bring the prisoner before a judge to justify the imprisonment, serving as a fundamental safeguard against unlawful confinement and arbitrary detention by ensuring due process. Filed by or on behalf of someone in custody, it challenges constitutional violations, such as ineffective legal counsel or unfair trials, and seeks release or other relief, often as a last resort after appeals are exhausted.\n\n“Since the conclusion of her trial, substantial new evidence has emerged from related civil actions, Government disclosures, investigative reports, and documents demonstrating constitutional violations that undermined the fairness of her proceeding,” the filing in Manhattan federal court said. “In the light of the full evidentiary record, no reasonable juror would have convicted her.”\n\nThe filing came just two days before records in her case were scheduled to be released publicly as a result of President Donald Trump's signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The law, signed after months of public and political pressure, requires the Justice Department to provide the public with Epstein-related records by Dec. 19.\n\nForced to act by the new transparency law, the Justice Department has said it plans to release 18 categories of investigative materials gathered in the massive sex trafficking probe, including search warrants, financial records, notes from interviews with victims, and data from electronic devices.\n\nEpstein, a millionaire financier, was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking charges. A month later, he was found dead in his cell at a New York federal jail and the death was ruled a suicide. Maxwell, a British socialite, was arrested a year later and was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021. She was interviewed by the Justice Department’s second-in-command in July and was soon afterward moved from a federal prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas.\n\nAfter the Justice Department asked a New York federal judge to permit grand jury and discovery materials gathered prior to her trial to be released publicly, attorney David Markus wrote on her behalf that while Maxwell now “does not take a position” on unsealing documents from her case, doing so “would create undue prejudice so severe that it would foreclose the possibility of a fair retrial” if her habeas petition succeeds.\n\nThe records, Markus said, “contain untested and unproven allegations.”\n\nLast week, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan granted the Justice Department's request to publicly release the materials.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said during a news conference on another topic that he would follow the law and the judge's orders pertaining to the records.\n\nEngelmayer, who along with other judges had previously rejected Justice Department unsealing requests before the transparency law was passed, said the materials “do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor.”",

    "title": "Austria Buys M-346F Light Fighters",
    "description": "The M-346Fs will give Austria a new air combat boost, supplementing the country's long-troubled Eurofighter Typhoon fleet.",
    "fullText": "Austria is buying 12 M-346F Block 20 light combat aircraft from Italian defense contractor Leonardo, as part of an overhaul of its air force, the Luftstreitkräfte. Austria does already operate 15 Eurofighter Typhoons, which were procured under controversial circumstances. Those jets have notably limited capabilities compared to other Typhoons, as well as high operating costs, which have prompted attempts to offload them.\n\nLeonardo announced the Austrian contract today. As well as the dozen M-346s, the deal includes simulation systems for pilots, training for maintenance technicians, spare parts and equipment, plus logistical support for six years. The total cost is around $1.7 billion, and the first aircraft is due to be delivered in 2028.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, the Austrian Air Force will use the M-346Fs for the “defense needs of Austria’s national airspace and territory,” as well as for training.\n\nThe two-seat M-346 was originally developed as an advanced jet trainer, but light combat versions have long been offered for sale. Block 20 standard variants are notably well-equipped for aircraft of their size and weight. They come with a pair of large-area displays (LAD) in each cockpit, an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, a Link 16 datalink, and electronic countermeasures. The jets are capable of being configured to employ various air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons options, but can also be operated as pure trainers.\n\nIn the trainer role, the M-346Fs will serve as a successor to the Austrian Air Force’s Saab 105 jets, which were retired in 2020, and are seen in the video below.\n\nThe M-346 has been developed by Leonardo as part of an integrated advanced flight training system. Beyond the jets themselves, this includes a ground-based training system (GBTS), which is based around the live, virtual, and constructive (LVC) concept. In this way, simulated elements and scenarios can be combined with real-life training flights.\n\nAustria is already familiar with the M-346 as its pilots already train on it at the International Flight Training School (IFTS), which Leonardo and the Italian Air Force operate together in Decimomannu, Italy.\n\nAccording to Leonardo, the complete training system for Austria will include capabilities related to air-to-surface missions. This would be a new development for the Austrian Air Force, which is currently optimized for air defense.\n\nIt will also allow pilots to train for aerial refueling, something else that hasn’t previously been featured in the Alpine air arm’s operations. It is worth noting here that the Luftstreitkräfte does not currently operate any tankers itself.\n\nMost notably, however, as well as advanced training, Austria will fly the M-346 in the “dual role of fighter for lower-intensity operations,” according to Leonardo.\n\nWhile the now-retired Saab 105s had a limited air-policing role, the M-346F’s capabilities mean that certain, more expansive operational missions could be ‘downloaded’ from the expensive Typhoon and onto the smaller and more economical jet.\n\nNonetheless, this would still be a significant augmentation for the Typhoon force, not least because Austria is a small country and the M-346F would be capable of responding to most routine threats, especially thanks to its AESA radar.\n\nFurthermore, the Austrian Typhoons have no beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile armament, so the M-346Fs wouldn’t be at a disadvantage in terms of weaponry, either.\n\nIn fact, an argument could be made for Austria having ordered the M-346F, or a similar light combat aircraft, rather than the Typhoon in the first place.\n\nThe Typhoon acquisition was far from straightforward. Austria selected the Eurofighter design over the Saab JAS 39C/D Gripen in 2002, but only finished paying off the €2 billion ($2.3 billion at the rate of conversion at the time of writing) purchase costs for the 15 single-seat jets (an order that was also reduced from a planned 18 aircraft) in 2014. The deal was also overshadowed by accusations of deception, fraud, and bribery, including a high-level lawsuit filed by the defense ministry against Airbus and Eurofighter.\n\nOverall, the Austrian Ministry of Defense has been far from happy with the Typhoon. It has called into question the jet’s operating costs and lack of certain critical capabilities — including the PIRATE infrared sensor, a helmet-mounted display, and the EuroDASS self-defense suite. As mentioned above, the Austrian jets have no beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles and lack any air-to-ground capability.\n\nAs long ago as 2017, Austria outlined plans to phase out the Typhoons by 2023, arguing that it would be cheaper than upgrading them. Since these are the baseline Tranche 1 jets, equipped to the most basic standard, it is far harder to modernize them. At this time, it was envisaged that they would be replaced by 18 new fighters, which would also supersede the Saab 105s.\n\nMore recently, efforts were made to try to sell the Typhoons to Indonesia, as you can read about here.\n\nSomewhat ironically, back in 2020, Austria’s Green Party called for the replacement of both the Typhoon and the Saab 105 with the M-346.\n\nAs TWZ noted at the time, “Austrian Typhoon pilots already train on the M-346 in Italy, and in many ways it would seem to make an ideal replacement for the two-seat Saab. However, it lacks the raw performance and sophisticated avionics of a modern fighter jet, which would render it less suitable for the air policing role now undertaken by the Typhoon.”\n\nHowever, the M-346F Block 20 is a much more capable proposition in terms of avionics, although it remains subsonic.\n\nAs a non-aligned nation, Austria can’t rely on NATO support to defend its airspace, so having additional, more economical light combat aircraft to help do this job will be welcome.\n\nThe M-346 also has the benefit of an established user base and supply chains to go along with it. As a trainer, existing M-346 customers include Greece, Italy, Israel, Poland, Qatar, and Singapore. The Italian Air Force has also selected it as the future aircraft for its aerobatic team, the Frecce Tricolori.\n\nLeonardo, as part of a team-up with Textron in the United States, has also been offering a navalized M-346N version to the U.S. Navy as a possible replacement for that service’s T-45 Goshawk jet trainers. You can read more about the M-346N, which was rebranded as a Beechcraft product earlier this year, here. Beechcraft is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Textron.\n\nThe only country known to have already introduced a light combat aircraft version of the M-346 is Turkmenistan, which reportedly acquired just four M-346FA (Fighter Attack) versions, as well as two trainers. It’s unclear exactly what kinds of weapons the country’s jets carry.\n\nHowever, Nigeria now looks to be lining up to buy the M-346FA, as well, with a potential deal for as many as 24 of the jets reportedly on the cards.\n\nBuying the M-346 also further cements the Austrian Ministry of Defense’s own relationship with Leonardo, from which it previously acquired 36 AW169M Light Utility Helicopters (LUH) under two contracts signed in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe Austrian order and the possibility of a larger sale to Nigeria are good news for Leonardo, which is continuing to evolve the M-346 from an advanced jet trainer into an ever more versatile multirole light combat aircraft.\n\nThe overall market space for light fighters based on advanced jet trainers is steadily growing globally, too. Korea Aerospace Industries has seen particular success with its FA-50 version of its T-50 trainer. The possibility of Boeing developing a light fighter based on its T-7 Redhawk for the U.S. Air Force has also come up in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, the Austrian Air Force remains stuck with the Typhoon, something of a costly white elephant when it’s considered that its primary mission is peacetime air policing over neutral airspace. Ultimately, perhaps, the Typhoon might be retired without a direct replacement, leaving the future M-346Fs to take on all frontline fighter roles.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "description": "Tucker Carlson claimed that a member of Congress told him lawmakers were briefed that President Donald Trump is announcing \"war is coming\" tonight.",
    "fullText": "Tucker Carlson claimed in a Wednesday interview that a member of Congress told him lawmakers were briefed that President Donald Trump is announcing “war is coming” tonight.\n\nCarlson joined Andrew Napolitano on his Judging Freedom podcast on Wednesday where they discussed growing tensions with Venezuela over strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as Trump’s address to the nation, scheduled for tonight.\n\n“Is Trump going to start a war in Venezuela?” Napolitano asked Carlson.\n\nAccording to Carlson, members of Congress were briefed on Trump’s plans, though he added he does not know the actual contents of Trump’s address.\n\n“Here’s what I know so far, which is that members of Congress were briefed yesterday that a war is coming and it’ll be announced in the address to the nation tonight at nine o’clock by the president,” Carlson said. “Who knows, by the way, if that’ll actually happen.”\n\nThe former Fox News host claimed he was told about the briefing by a member of Congress that morning.\n\nNotably, Axios’s Marc Caputo, who is well-sourced inside the Trump White House, reacted to Carlson’s comments, saying, “My sources say this wasn’t briefed & this announcement isn’t happening at 9.”\n\nCarlson is opposed to military action in Venezuela, arguing it would be repeating foreign policy mistakes of the past.\n\n“There’s not been a regime change effort that’s benefitted the United States or the world in 80 years that I’m aware of,” he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of being at the head of a narco terrorist smuggling operation. Maduro’s election victory has long been contested, with U.S. and global officials casting doubt on the results.\n\n“The illegitimate Maduro Regime is using Oil from these stolen Oil Fields to finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping. For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,” Trump announced this week.\n\nThe president has also set his sights on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, responding to his criticism of recent boat strikes by warning him he could have “big problems” soon.\n\n“He’s gonna have himself some big problems if he doesn’t wise up,” Trump told reporters. “Did he say Colombia’s producing a lot of drugs? They have cocaine factories that they make cocaine, as you know, and they sell it right into the United States. So he better wise up or he’ll be next.”\n\nThe post ‘War is Coming’: Tucker Carlson Says a Member of Congress Told Him What Trump Is Announcing Tonight first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "Obamacare subsidies are set to expire. Dems call Idaho ‘ground zero’ for crisis",
    "description": "Idaho’s Affordable Care Act marketplace closed open enrollment Monday. What the data show about who signed up for insurance — and who didn’t.",
    "fullText": "If federal subsidies for marketplace health insurance plans expire at the end of the year, Idahoans on the most “vulnerable fringes” will feel the effects first, Rep. Ilana Rubel, a Boise Democrat, said Tuesday.\n\nBut it won’t be long until the loss of those subsidies, which keep insurance premiums low for people on Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance plans, “hits every single person in the state,” she said at a protest organized by Ada County Democrats.\n\nWithout the subsidies, monthly premiums are expected to more than double for many plans, the Kaiser Family Foundation found. If marketplace premiums dramatically increase without federal subsidies, more people will likely choose to go uninsured — a serious problem for hospitals, which rely on people with private insurance plans to pay the bills, Rubel said.\n\n“When you pull out people’s private insurance, you make it impossible for hospitals and providers to operate profitably,” Rubel said. “You can be the richest person in the state with fabulous insurance, but if a hospital in your area has gone out of business, and you have a heart attack, you are out of luck.”\n\nIdaho’s open enrollment period closed Monday — the first marketplace in the country to do so. At Tuesday’s protest, held outside the Boise office of U.S. Sen. Jim Risch in protest of Congressional Republicans’ “inaction” on reinstating the subsidies, Ada County Democrats Chair Jared DeLoof said Idaho would be “ground zero for a national health care affordability crisis.”\n\nMadison Hardy, a spokesperson for Risch, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“People do die from a lack of health care. People do die from a lack of health insurance,” Rubel said. “Unfortunately, we are going to be Exhibit A for that shortly.”\n\nHer predictions were echoed by leaders of Your Health Idaho, the state’s official health insurance marketplace. Of the 115,000 Idaho residents who rely on marketplace plans, the marketplace expects 25,000 to cancel their coverage as plans become more expensive, said Nichol Lapierre, its chief marketing officer.\n\nBut initial data from Your Health Idaho painted a more murky picture of residents’ decisions. Twice as many Idaho residents canceled their existing marketplace coverage as during open enrollment last year, Lapierre said — but there were also more people who enrolled in new plans, leading to a 4% increase in the number of people enrolled overall.\n\nThough Your Health Idaho is “encouraged” by the overall increase in enrollment, Executive Director Pat Kelly said, he highlighted a nearly 10% shift from “gold” and “silver” plans that cover almost all health care costs to “bronze” plans that have lower premiums but much higher deductibles and other costs.\n\nAround 5,000 customers have canceled plans for the upcoming year because of concerns about affordability, according to Your Health Idaho, and the marketplace anticipates more cancellations in the coming months. If premiums spike in early 2026, Your Health Idaho expects another 20,000 Idaho residents to cancel their coverage or be terminated by their insurance carriers for nonpayment.\n\n“The final enrollment numbers won’t settle until April,” Lapierre said.\n\nDeLoof emphasized that these marketplace plans are not “handouts,” but rather the plans used by small business owners, self-employed workers and farmers.\n\nThough those people make too much to qualify for Medicaid, they “cannot absorb the massive premium hikes that are coming their way,” he said Tuesday. “Working families are being squeezed from every direction.”\n\nBecca Savransky contributed reporting.\n\n‘People are going to die’: Idahoans fear spike in insurance costs\n\nMore Idaho children are losing health insurance.

    "fullText": "Australia off-spinner Nathan Lyon has overtaken legendary compatriot Glenn McGrath to move sixth in the all-time list of Test wicket-takers.\n\nLyon, 38, needed two wickets at the start of the third Ashes Test in Adelaide to overhaul seamer McGrath's tally of 563.\n\nHe moved level by having England's Ollie Pope caught at mid-wicket with his third ball of the game, before claiming his 564th Test scalp by bowling Ben Duckett three balls later.\n\nLyon is now the second-highest Australian Test wicket-taker behind the late legendary leg-spinner Shane Warne, who took 708.\n\nHe is also the the highest active player in the rankings and fourth-highest spinner, behind former Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan (800), Warne and ex-India leg-spinner Anil Kumble (619).\n\nRetired England greats Sir James Anderson (third on 704) and Stuart Broad (fifth on 604) are the only two pace bowlers ahead of Lyon.\n\n\"What a bowler. Nathan Lyon deserves to get that,\" said McGrath on BBC Test Match Special.\n\n\"You wondered what impact Nathan Lyon was going to have in this game. First over, and that was a gem of a ball [to remove Ben Duckett].\n\n\"He has been brilliant for Australia. He will go down as one of the greatest Australia spin bowlers behind Shane Warne.\n\n\"Lyon is the greatest off-spin bowler for Australia, he knows the craft so well. He has been part of that big four for Australia for such a long time.\"",

Tell me how.”\n\nWhen a second user doubled down, saying Cuban must not be that smart if he didn't know how his wealth could help end hunger, Cuban fired back sarcastically: “I’m dumb. I can’t figure out how to end world hunger.” But he quickly pivoted to something he believes he can do something about: the American healthcare system.\n\n“I do promise that I will continue to change healthcare in this country and make it more affordable, possibly setting a path towards Universal Healthcare,” Cuban said.\n\nFast Company Calls It a ‘Groundbreaking Step for the Creator Economy' — Investors Can Still Get In at $0.85/Share\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nHe's already been making moves. Through his company, Cost Plus Drugs, Cuban is working to bring down drug prices by eliminating the middlemen who inflate costs. The company adds just a 15% markup on medications and publishes its entire price list online. It now offers over 6,000 medications.\n\nCuban has been especially critical of pharmacy benefit managers, who he believes were supposed to lower costs but have instead become profit-driven giants. According to him, they acquired insurance providers and retail pharmacies and are now attempting to expand into pharmaceutical manufacturing. “They got greedy,” Cuban told Fortune earlier this year.\n\nAlthough Cuban believes “healthcare is a right,” he argues that moving the U.S. to a universal healthcare system isn't the quick fix people assume it is. In a September post on X, he said, “The easy answer is to say Universal Healthcare. The challenge is that every single country that has UHC, moved to it before medical science introduced advanced expensive equipment.”\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nHe added that the hard part is delivering care fairly without financially devastating doctors and hospitals. “The only challenge is how we design the system that works in this country,” he wrote.\n\nCuban has floated an alternative idea: keep insurers from being the central force, eliminate premiums, and expand cash-pay options with clear pricing. That way, patients would commit to what they can afford, with taxpayers covering the rest.",

    "fullText": "Honda, a generally reliable automaker, has initiated several significant recalls in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nFor at least the third time over this past month and a half, the Japanese auto giant is issuing a massive recall for a hazardous issue.\n\nThe first recall,  announced on Oct. 31 through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), involves Honda Civic models spanning six model years. Honda Civics from model years 2016 to 2021 with 18-inch alloy wheels are affected.\n\nThe company warned that loose or missing lug seat inserts could cause the wheel nuts to loosen over time, potentially leading to wheel separation during use.\n\nAccording to the safety recall report, the defect originated when a factory worker at the wheel supplier’s facility in Italy moved a safety fence that separated finished wheels from unfinished ones.\n\nIn November, Honda announced a recall of more than 250,000 Accord Hybrids due to a potentially dangerous software flaw that could cause the CPU to reset while driving, resulting in the car losing drive power, according to an NHTSA alert.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Highway Traffic Administration announced that Honda is recalling 70,658 vehicles in the U.S. due to reduced brake function that can extend the distance required to stop, increasing the risk of a crash or injury.\n\nHonda told regulators that the issue was identified through internal investigations and customer feedback. While it says it has not reported any fatalities related to the problem, it did acknowledge that the compromised braking poses a safety concern.\n\nHonda dealers will inspect the impacted vehicles at no cost to customers.\n\nThe recall affects Acura ILX vehicles manufactured from 2014 to 2020 due to a residual plasticizer in the brake reservoir hose, which causes the master cylinder seal to swell.\n\nThe defect can reduce brake-pedal firmness and increase stopping distances.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Administration has recorded a disturbing trend over the past five years. Millions of Americans are driving around in vehicles that have been recalled but were never fixed, according to NHTSA data.\n\nWhile the number of vehicles recalled is trending lower, the number of recalls issued has remained elevated above pre-Covid levels.\n\nThere were fewer than 30 million recalls in 2024, marking the third time this has happened in the last 10 years, yet more than 1,000 recalls were issued for the fourth consecutive year.",

There really can't be many believers left. As Nancy spoke, it was hard to avoid wincing and wincing and wincing again.\n\nAs he made his way through his post-match assessment, the temptation was to shout, 'Stop... stop talking... stop explaining because when you're explaining, you're losing, again'.\n\nThe bottom line in all of this is that between his nightmarish beginning with Celtic and his low-key ending with Columbus Crew, Nancy has won just three of his past 16 games as a manager.\n\nThe defeats by United, St Mirren, Roma and Hearts now joined the ones that went before in America - Cincinnati (twice), Chicago Fire, New York City and New England Revolution.\n\nNancy finished seventh in the regular season in MLS, won 14 of 34 games, ranking joint sixth in the league for goals scored and eighth for goals conceded. After being manager of the season the year before, it was all very blah.\n\nHis credentials for the Celtic job were, at best, thin, despite the excited rhetoric of some observers in America, who painted him as a special one and his capture as a coup.",

    "fullText": "A report from Reuters claims that scientists in China have created a prototype of a machine that could eventually be used to produce semiconductor chips capable of powering artificial intelligence. Sources told the publication that a team in Shenzhen completed the prototype of an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine earlier this year and it is allegedly now undergoing testing. The EUV machine was reportedly made by former engineers from Dutch semiconductor supplier ASML. Reuters states that China is targeting production of its own EUV chips beginning in 2028, although other experts have projected 2030 as a more likely date.\n\nEUV is a supremely complicated bit of technology; we have an explainer below that gets into some of the details. It is at the heart of the chips made by companies such as Intel and TSMC, so any company trying to compete would also need access to EUV. Although the Chinese prototype is not yet making chips, it is reportedly able to generate the extreme ultraviolet light needed for chip manufacturing.\n\nIf confirmed, this development would put China in control of tech much sooner than analysts had previously expected. To date, EUV has largely been kept out of reach by Western companies and used as a bargaining chip by the US government. Chinese President Xi Jinping has placed a high priority on the country being able to produce its own semiconductors. \"The aim is for China to eventually be able to make advanced chips on machines that are entirely China-made,\" a source told Reuters. \"China wants the United States 100 percent kicked out of its supply chains.\"",

    "fullText": "Many electric vehicle drivers have experienced disturbing incidents at charging stations when others maliciously unplug the cables or even cut the cords. Surveillance footage and personal confrontations often reveal that vandals disrupt EV charging out of spite or hatred towards people who own and drive clean-energy vehicles.\n\nHowever, even business owners and store managers sometimes unplug EVs on their property, much to the dismay of drivers who rely on public charging stations.\n\nIn a Reddit post to r/TeslaModelY, one driver shared details about a frustrating encounter while charging at a local grocery store.\n\nThe OP explained they began charging their EV at a grocery store and went into the store's Starbucks to work while it was charging. The store manager told the OP that he unplugged the car because those stations are only for customers.\n\nHowever, the OP was actually a customer who bought a drink and was working inside the store's coffee shop. The encounter made the OP feel \"extremely uncomfortable,\" so they packed up their belongings and left.\n\n\"I'm bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at, and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping, but I don't want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will, without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging,\" the OP shared.\n\nThis situation is unfortunate because it prevented an EV driver from charging their EV. It also created anxiety for the OP by eliminating a reliable charging source while out running errands.\n\nUnfortunately, EV driver harassment is a widespread problem worldwide. Not only do unplugging vehicles and other threatening behaviors create unnecessary tension between EV and non-EV owners, but they also slow the broader adoption of clean-energy driving.\n\nThose who have yet to learn about the impressive technological advancements and benefits of EVs may rely on outdated information or anti-EV propaganda to justify their actions.\n\nIt's true that EV production does use some natural resources and generates some pollution. However, EVs are still far cleaner and more sustainable than gas-powered vehicles, which release tailpipe fumes wherever they go.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhen you embrace highly efficient electric vehicle driving, you help sustain breathable air and contribute less to overheating the planet. You can also save significantly on vehicle ownership costs by avoiding the need to buy gas and the routine maintenance costs of traditional cars.\n\nIn response to the OP's post, Reddit users offered their advice about how to handle the situation.\n\n\"You should definitely use one of those charging locks next time you go,\" one Redditor recommended.\n\n\"I would complain to corporate or his boss,\" someone else suggested.\n\n\"Report them for tampering with a customer's car,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices likely increased by the most in 1-1/2 years in the year to November, economists predicted, which would underscore the worsening affordability challenges confronting Americans that have been partly blamed on tariffs on imports.\n\nThe Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will not publish month-to-month changes when ​it releases the delayed Consumer Price Index report for November on Tuesday after the 43-day shutdown of the government prevented the collection of October data. The October CPI release ‌was canceled because the price data could not be collected retroactively.\n\nThe longest shutdown in history also impacted labor market data, with the government failing to publish an unemployment rate for October for the first time ever.\n\nBut the BLS will publish ‌the year-on-year rates for the CPI and the so-called core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy components.\n\nThe agency publishes numerous indexes in addition to the broad CPI and core CPI. Those derived from data that does not need to be physically collected will be available, though the BLS said it expected \"the number of publishable indexes to be small.\"\n\nThe statistics agency has said it \"cannot provide specific guidance to data users for navigating the missing October observations.\" Economists advised viewing the CPI and its components on a year-on-year basis or two-month change.\n\n\"Downward inflation progress has stalled,\" said Andy Schneider, a senior U.S. economist ⁠at BNP Paribas. \"This largely reflects companies in goods-producing sectors passing tariff ‌costs through into prices.\"\n\nThe CPI likely increased 3.1% year-on-year in November, which would be the largest gain since May 2024, a Reuters survey of economists estimated. The CPI advanced 3.0% in the 12 months through September.\n\nBut the CPI could print below expectations as data collection was delayed late into the month, ‍when retailers offered holiday season discounts. That could be evident in lower prices for goods like furniture and recreation goods.\n\n\"November CPI this year could capture a period that more heavily reflects holiday season discounts than a usual November, which would reflect average prices through the whole month,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. \"If there is some abnormal weakness in November goods prices, there could be a larger rebound in these components in ​December.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's sweeping import duties have raised prices for many goods, though the tariff pass-through has been gradual as businesses worked through inventory accumulated prior to the tightening of trade ‌policy and also absorbed some of the taxes, evident in moderate new motor vehicle price increases.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.\n\nArnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.\n\n“Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation — intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,” said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP’s chief correspondent at the United Nations.\n\nAs a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.\n\nWhile almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.\n\n\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.\n\n\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. “They are hitting the center of the city.”\n\nIt was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.\n\nIn January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.\n\n\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,” Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. “He sank to the ground at my feet.”\n\nHe would begin the fallen soldier’s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"\n\nArnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia’s economy was in shambles and the country’s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.\n\nAt the AP’s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nHe credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.\n\nArnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP’s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau’s papers as coverage of the war wound down.\n\nInstead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they’d have historic value someday. They’re now in the AP’s archives.\n\nArnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.\n\nTen years later he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.\n\nIn 1995 he published the memoir, “Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.”\n\nArnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.\n\nHe was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military’s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.\n\nAfter his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.\n\nIn 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China’s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.\n\nBorn Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.\n\n\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a — you know — enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.\n\nAfter a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.\n\nSoon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.\n\nArnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.\n\n\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.”\n\nAP journalist Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report.",

However, New England will need to wait for the outcome of the last two weeks, which will be determined by division opponents, to see if it can clinch the AFC East title.\n\nNew England currently has an 11-3 record, while Buffalo is at 10-4. If the Patriots win their remaining games, they will secure the AFC East title. However, after losing to Buffalo in Week 15, they lost the head-to-head tiebreaker, as the Patriots and Bills split their matchups this season.\n\nThe next tiebreaker is based on wins against division opponents. The Patriots have a 3-1 record, while the Bills are 3-2 following their loss to the Dolphins.\n\nEven if the Patriots lose to the Ravens but defeat the Jets and Dolphins, New England will still claim the AFC East title, even if the Bills win all their remaining games.\n\nPatriots-Ravens Injury Report: Lamar Jackson Among Starters Missing On Both Sides",

Kolyachonok had his first practice with the Bruins on Wednesday, and head coach Marco Sturm said the team added him as more depth.\n\n“That’s why we kind of picked him up,” Sturm said on Wednesday. “We needed some extra help, we are running really thin right now, and didn’t want to get in trouble, getting one injury away.\n\n“We felt like he will be a good addition to our D-group.

The left-shot defenseman will add depth to Boston’s blue line, but Sturm isn’t sure when he will make his Bruins’ debut.\n\n“He has a little bit of everything, I feel like he has a little bit of offense, he can defend,” Sturm said. “I think he played some PK as well. We look at him as a depth guy, and hopefully he is going to get a chance, too, I don’t know when.”\n\nKolyachonok, meanwhile, is just excited to be with Boston and will play whatever role is asked of him.\n\n“Whatever they tell me to do, I am going to do it,” Kolyachonok said.\n\nThe Bruins will return to the ice on Thursday at home against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nCharlie McAvoy Shouts Out Unsung Hero From Bruins’ Win Vs.

Wearing the captain’s armband on the night, the Ukrainian goalkeeper addressed the media.\n\n“Thanks to the half of the squad that wasn’t here, to all the captains — being captain of Real Madrid is always an honor. There’s a lot of hard work and time behind it, and I’m grateful to everyone who has helped me all this time.”\n\n“It was difficult to advance, it’s always difficult. The Cup is different, the matches are different and I would like to advance without conceding any goals, but we are already in the round of 16 and we have to keep fighting for the Cup.”\n\n“You have to understand that every coach is different. Ancelotti was older, more experienced, and had won everything in his career. Xabi is young, everyone respects him, there are new things going on, and it’s a normal process of adaptation and change.”\n\n“I don’t know who could doubt Xabi, we don’t doubt our coach. We’re a group and we’re all in the same boat. I don’t know who’s questioning him, whether it’s the fans or the press, but in the end it doesn’t matter to us because we’re focused on our job.”\n\n“We prepare for every match the same way. We are all aware here of what club we are at and what is at stake. We must win every match.\n\n“We had to be even more aggressive, focused, and not relax. We advanced, and that’s the most important thing.”\n\n“I don’t think that way. It’s my job, what I’ve been doing since I was little. I have to help the team and always be ready.”\n\n“We had to play a serious match and we did so to a certain point. The important thing was to get through the round and keep fighting.”",

    "description": "Follow the latest injury news for fantasy football lineups in Week 16.",
    "fullText": "Staying up to date on NFL injury news is of the utmost importance for fantasy football success. The article below tracks all fantasy-relevant players currently listed on their team's injury report, and provides fantasy managers with actionable recommendations as new information rolls in.\n\nCheck back for updates from Tuesday through Saturday.\n\n**UPDATED AS OF WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 17TH AT 7:25 PM ET**\n\nKincaid practiced fully through the knee injury last week. He was held out on Wednesday, to begin Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: It is possible he suffered a setback. Thursday and Friday's injury reports are worth following.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Bills signed kicker Michael Badgley to kick in Prater's stead. He is barely on the K1 radar.\n\nHill suffered a dislocated knee in the team's Week 4 win over the Jets. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Hill's absence likely places additional emphasis on the short-to-intermediate areas of the field, increasing the expected target volume for De'Von Achane, Darren Waller, and Jaylen Waddle.\n\nJennings will miss the rest of the regular season on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jennings is no longer a threat to steal short-yardage carries.\n\nHall is practicing fully for Week 16 against the Saints.\n\nFantasy Impact: He remains an RB2.\n\nTaylor has been ruled out for Week 16, missing his second consecutive game.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell should operate as the clear-cut No. 1 pass catcher.\n\nTaylor departed the team's Week 14 loss to the Dolphins with a groin injury and did not return. Taylor was sidelined on Wednesday and did not play in Week 15. He is competing with quarterback Justin Fields (knee) for the primary backup role.\n\nFields is rehabbing the knee injury while competing for the No. 2 job.\n\nWilson sprained his knee in his return to the active roster in Week 10 and is set to miss \"three-to-four weeks.\" He was placed on injured reserve and is eligible to return in Week 15. Head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters Monday that he did not have an update on Wilson's potential return from injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Whelp, Wilson's return didn't last long as he is now set to miss another chunk of time with an additional knee injury. The Jets again find themselves bereft of pass-catching talent. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor stands to benefit the most in a fantasy setting, although the Jets continue to be allergic to throwing the football. Head coach Aaron Glenn said last week that he expects Wilson to \"return this season.\"\n\nAllen suffered a \"pretty serious\" knee injury on a kickoff return in the second quarter of the team's Week 4 loss to the Dolphins. He is out indefinitely.\n\nFantasy Impact: Allen has been a significant contributor in the red zone this season. His absence substantially boosts Breece Hall's upside, who is now a locked-in RB1 in Week 5 against the Cowboys. Backup running back Isaiah Davis can be stashed in 12-team leagues as a high-upside contingency option. Hall gained a season-high 155 yards from scrimmage on 18 opportunities in his first game without Allen in Week 5.\n\nReynolds was evidently placed on injured reserve in Week 10, after suffering a hip injury during practice in Week 8.\n\nFantasy Impact: Reynolds' absence clears the way for new Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to be active on game day.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jackson has finished as a QB1 twice since Week 9. He faces the Patriots' capable defense in Week 16. He is a highly volatile, high-end QB2.\n\nHill will not play in Week 13. Head coach John Harbaugh said Monday that Hill could return \"in three to four weeks.\"\n\nFantasy Impact: Running back Keaton Mitchell will continue operating as the clear-cut No. 2 in Baltimore.\n\nHiggins missed Week 13 with a concussion. He was placed back into protocol following Week 14 after reporting symptoms after the game and did not play in Week 15. He remains limited at the beginning of Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: A second concussion in two calendar weeks is a significant issue for Higgins. Bengals tight end Mike Gesicki would benefit if Higgins misses time.\n\nNjoku aggravated his knee injury in Week 14. He was ruled out for Week 15 and remains sidelined in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: We expect rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. to continue operating as the team's No. 1 pass catcher. Start Fannin with confidence after a career game a week ago.\n\nSampson was sidelined by the calf injury in Week 15. He has not yet resumed practicing.\n\nFantasy Impact: Fellow rookie RB Quinshon Judkins earned four targets with Sampson out last week, tying his career-high. Judkins totaled minus-four yards on three receptions, though. He is an inefficient receiver.\n\nThe Browns signed running back Trayveon Williams after placing Ford on injured reserve this week.\n\nFantasy Impact: Williams is unlikely to contribute on game day, now occupying the No. 3 role. We expect No. 2 running back Dylan Sampson (calf/hand) to continue playing through injury.\n\nThe Steelers did not experience any fantasy-relevant injuries in their Week 15 win over the Dolphins.\n\nFantasy Football Defense (DST) Week 16 Rankings and Streamers\n\nEric Samulski breaks down his fantasy football defense rankings for Week 16 of the NFL season\n\nMarks was unable to finish the team's Week 15 win over the Cardinals due to an ankle injury. He did not practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach DeMeco Ryans told reporters Monday that Marks \"should be fine\" moving forward, and that he likely could have returned against the Cardinals.\n\nChubb was unable to finish the team's Week 14 win over the Chiefs due to a ribs injury and did not play in Week 15. He returned to practice in a limited capacity on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Chubb could handle double-digit touches if Marks is unable to play.\n\nMixon was placed on the Non-Football Injury list ahead of Week 1. He is not expected to play this year.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran Nick Chubb is now in a game script-dependent rushing role, while rookie running back Woody Marks operates as the starter.\n\nJones played through a fracture in his fibula for two-plus games before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 14. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury comes at the worst possible time for the sliding Colts, who have dropped from the two-seed to the fringes of playoff contention in three short weeks. Making matters worse, Riley Leonard suffered a knee injury in relief duties against the Jaguars. The Colts signed potential Hall of Fame candidate Philip Rivers, who is set to draw another start in Week 16.\n\nLeonard suffered a PCL sprain in Week 14. He is practicing fully.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran grandfather Philip Rivers was elevated from the practice squad to start in Week 15 against the Seahawks.\n\nRichardson suffered a \"freak accident\" ahead of Week 6 in which an elastic band snapped a piece of metal hit him in the eye, fracturing his orbital bone. He was placed on injured reserve. He was medically cleared to resume practicing on Monday, but he is not a candidate to start.\n\nFantasy Impact: Richardson was medically cleared to practice Monday but the team already named veteran Philip Rivers the starter for Week 16.\n\nTuten underwent successful surgery on his finger Monday and will miss the remainder of the season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Tuten's injury leaves Travis Etienne alone in the backfield, although the team signed journeyman DeeJay Dallas on Tuesday. Etienne carries clear league-winning upside in a likely robust role for the remainder of the season. Rookie running back LeQuint Allen can be stashed.\n\nHunter was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending LCL tear.\n\nFantasy Impact: See Thomas' section above.\n\nFantasy Impact: Helm should be good to go for TE2-worthy duties.\n\nRidley reportedly broke his fibula in Week 11 and is out for the season.\n\nFantasy Impact: It's a disappointing end to a disappointing season for the veteran receiver. The Titans are left with no standout fantasy options in his absence.\n\nBryant managed to suit up on Sunday after straining his hamstring in Week 14's Thursday practice session. He was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Bryant is back on the FLEX radar against the Jaguars.\n\nHarvey is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Harvey is a locked-in RB2 against the Jaguars.\n\nDobbins was ruled out on Friday before being placed on IR on Saturday. The injury requires surgery, likely ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie RJ Harvey is in line to see a noticeable increase to what has been a modest snap rate, although Tyler Badie remained frustratingly involved. Jaleel McLaughlin also saw increased opportunities on early downs.\n\nRice “reported concussion symptoms on Monday and entered the league’s protocol,” jeopardizing his availability against the Titans. He did not practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton is also in the NFL's concussion protocol. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce could handle a sizable workload in Week 16.\n\nMahomes suffered a season-ending ACL tear with an associated LCL tear in the Chiefs' Week 15 loss to the Chargers. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Mahomes underwent successful surgery Monday to repair both ligaments, thusly starting an estimated nine-month recovery timetable. Gardner Minshew will start for the Chiefs for the remainder of the season after the team was eliminated from postseason contention in Week 15.\n\nBrown was ruled out for Week 15 Friday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Although not a direct benefit to any singular player, both JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton have fewer bodies to compete with for rotational snaps.\n\nSmith missed the Raiders' Week 15 game against the Eagles after entering Week 14 with a foot injury and exiting with a throwing shoulder injury and significant abrasions on his throwing hand's ring and pinky fingers. Raiders head coach Pete Carroll said there is a \"good chance\" Smith will start in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Texans' elite defense can be safely expected to keep Smith in the low-end QB2 range this week.\n\nJohnston was added to the team's injury report on Friday with a groin issue and did not play in Week 15. He resumed practicing the following Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Johnston is back on the boom-bust FLEX radar against a wide receiver-friendly Cowboys defense.\n\nHarris ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg during the Chargers' Week 3 win over the Broncos. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal are likely to continue splitting backfield work until the former can work his way back into game shape.\n\n10 Fantasy Football Takeaways from Week 15: Kyle Pitts rises, Justin Jefferson falls\n\nOn the heels of a historic performance, Kyle Pitts is rising up the fantasy ranks ahead of Week 16. Justin Jefferson, on the other hand, is in freefall.\n\nWilliams injured his neck early in the Cowboys' Week 16 game against the Vikings. Although he missed snaps, including opportunities in the red zone, he did manage to play through it. He was limited on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Williams is a low-end RB1 against the Chargers.\n\nFantasy Impact: Ferguson was hampered by the injury last week. His return to full participation is a good sign.\n\nSanders was injured in Week 4 and did not play in Week 5. He was ruled out for Week 6 before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Veteran Javonte Williams continues to operate in a near workhorse role.\n\nNabers suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 4 win over the Chargers and will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury could not have come at a worse time for the Giants after they moved to rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart under center. Nabers' absence will make it difficult to consistently move the football, lowering the upside of all remaining healthy players. Nabers makes for a solid trade target for dynasty managers looking to rebuild this season.\n\nSkattebo suffered a gruesome dislocated ankle in the team's Week 8 loss to the Eagles, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: The backfield in New York should revert to a timeshare headed by veteran Tyrone Tracy in Skattebo's absence. Devin Singletary remains on hand for change-of-pace duties. Treat Tracy as a low-end RB2 for the remainder of the season.\n\nBarkely resumed practicing on Wednesday after sitting out on Tuesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: It would be nice to see Barkley practice fully on Thursday. He is a borderline RB1/2 against the Commanders.\n\nDaniels dislocated the elbow in his left, non-throwing arm in the team's Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. He was ruled out for the remainder of the season Monday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Backup quarterback Marcus Mariota will start for the Commanders in the final three weeks of the regular season. He is a borderline QB1/2.\n\nRodriguez did not practice on Wednesday and did not play in Week 15. He is practicing fully in Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt rushed 18 times for 96 yards and a touchdown with Rodriguez sidelined last week, which should return Croskey-Merritt to the starting role. This is worth following closely. Stay tuned.\n\nThe team placed Brown on injured reserve on Monday, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: None. Brown has not been fantasy-relevant all season.\n\nErtz suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 14 loss to the Vikings. His season is done.\n\nFantasy Impact: The hits keep on coming for the Commanders in a lost season. John Bates should step into a significant role for the Commanders down the stretch but likely does not carry enough upside for weekly fantasy consideration.\n\nOdunze returned to practice on Wednesday and missing all of Week 14. He was removed from the injury report for Week 15 before missing the game after aggravating the injury in pre-game warmups. He has not yet resumed practicing.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Ben Johnson told reporters Monday that \"all options are on the table\" regarding Odunze's status moving forward. That does not inspire confidence that he will be available in the coming weeks.\n\nBurden injured his ankle in Week 15 and has been unable to practice since.\n\nFantasy Impact: Bears tight end Colston Loveland, and wide receivers DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus should receive notable target share bumps if Odunze and Burden are both sidelined. Tight end Cole Kmet (knee/ankle) was also limited on Wednesday.\n\nSwift was not on Tuesday's injury report. He was added to Wednesday's injury report as a limited participant, which could indicate that he aggravated the groin injury he dealt with earlier this year.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie running back Kyle Monangai would vault into the RB1 tier if Swift cannot face the Packers this week.\n\nWright landed hard on his neck in Week 12. He has been placed on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Backup tight ends Shane Zylstra (knee) and Ross Dwelley form a fantasy-unfriendly duo, who should only be considered in DFS lineups.\n\nLaPorta was added to the Lions’ injury report with a back injury on Wednesday. After being ruled out for Week 11 on Friday, the Lions placed him on injured reserve on Saturday.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Lions’ pass-catching corps is deep. Removing LaPorta from it could result in one or more extra targets for WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR Jameson Williams and RB Jahmyr Gibbs.\n\nJacobs reportedly aggravated his knee injury in the team's Week 15 loss to the Broncos. His knee also reportedly \"stiffened\" up in Week 14 against the Bears. Aggravations in consecutive games are concerning. He missed Week 16's first two practices.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Monday that Jacobs \"would not have practiced\" had the team held a regular session. He should continue to see his practice reps managed and could be in line to miss Week 16 against the Bears. No. 2 running back Emanuel Wilson must be rostered.\n\nWatson was unable to finish the team's Week 15 loss to the Broncos after landing hard on his shoulder on a Jordan Love interception in the third quarter. Watson told reporters that he \"should be good” to play in Week 16 against the Bears.\n\nFantasy Impact: Watson is a high-upside WR3.\n\nKraft suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the team's Week 9 loss to the Panthers.\n\nFantasy Impact: Kraft's breakout season comes to an end prematurely after the untimely knee injury. Luke Musgrave should be rostered in all formats as he likely enters a featured role for the Packers.\n\nWentz will undergo season-ending surgery after playing through a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum.\n\nFantasy Impact: Second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy is the starter in Minnesota moving forward.\n\nLondon reportedly suffered a PCL sprain in the team's Week 11 loss to the Panthers. Head coach Raheem Morris labeled London \"day-to-day\" in Week 15, but the team ultimately ruled him out. He returned to practice on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Tight end Kyle Pitts has operated as the passing game's top option with London sidelined. London's practice participation level should help us determine his expected involvement if he is cleared to play this week. Stay tuned.\n\nPenix reportedly suffered a knee injury that included a partially torn ACL, a separate sprain and a bone bruise in the team's Week 11 loss to the Panthers. He will undergo season-ending ACL reconstruction.\n\nFantasy Impact: That leaves the team in the hands of veteran Kirk Cousins moving forward. Cousins notably completed 21-of-31 passes for only 173 yards with no touchdowns in his only other start this season, which came against an underperforming Dolphins team. The Falcons could be in some trouble the rest of the way.\n\nMcMillan did not practice on Wednesday. The team hopes to get him back on Thursday.\n\nFantasy Impact: Panthers slot receiver Jalen Coker is playing very well. He would likely hog targets if McMillan cannot play this week.\n\nNeal departed the team's Week 15 win over the Panthers with a hamstring injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled him out for Week 16 against the Jets.\n\nFantasy Impact: The Saints promoted running back Evan Hull to the active roster in November. Running back Audric Estime was promoted to the active roster for last week's game. Neither player ran efficiently, but Estime was surprisingly used effectively via screen passes and checkdowns. Estime could be the starter this week.\n\nVele could not finish the team's Week 15 win over the Panthers due to a shoulder injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled Vele out for Week 16 against the Jets.\n\nFantasy Impact: Mason Tipton would be next in line for snaps at wide receiver alongside Chris Olave, should Vele be unable to go in Week 16. Olave became quarterback Tyler Shough's go-to receiver after Vele left early in Week 15.\n\nKamara remains sidelined by his ankle injury and PCL sprain. He has neither practiced nor played since Week 12 and was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He remains sidelined to begin Week 16.\n\nMiller suffered a torn ACL in the team's Week 7 loss to the Bears. His season is over.\n\nFantasy Impact: Rookie Devin Neal should step into the primary change-of-pace role for the Saints in Miller's absence. Lead back Alvin Kamara saw the highest snap rate since Week 2 following Miller's departure and could be again looking at a workhorse role moving forward.\n\nOtton is doubtful to play in Week 15 against the Falcons. He did not play. Otton was limited to begin Week 16.\n\nFantasy Impact: Payne Durham is the next man up at tight end for the Buccaneers, although he remains unlikely to contribute in a meaningful way on Thursday Night Football.\n\nEvans was limited on Wednesday.\n\nFantasy Impact: This is likely just load management. Evans should be good to go for Week 16, without restrictions.\n\nHarrison picked up a heel injury in his return to the lineup following a two-game absence due to an appendectomy. He was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He has resumed practicing in a limited capacity.\n\nFantasy Impact: Wide receiver Michael Wilson has established himself as an elite fantasy starter in Harrison's absence. If Harrison returns, both players can be viewed as WR3s.\n\nThe Cardinals placed Knight on injured reserve Monday, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Michael Carter and Emari Demercado should split work in the backfield for the rest of the season.\n\nThe Cardinals placed Dortch on injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Wide receiver Michael Wilson will continue earning targets voluminously.\n\nBenson underwent surgery after injuring his meniscus in Week 4. The Cardinals opened his 21-day practice window in Week 12, but they ultimately decided not to activate him from injured reserve.\n\nFantasy Impact: Running back Bam Knight is seemingly the best bet to operate as the Cardinals' rest-of-season starter.\n\nMurray injured his foot on a fourth-quarter fumble in Week 5. He was placed on injured reserve in Week 10 and will be eligible to return in Week 14 against the Rams, though it could be as the Cardinals' backup. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Monday that the team will not open his 21-day practice window this week.\n\nFantasy Impact: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has finished as a QB1 in his last three games. He remains a viable streamer.\n\nConner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3.\n\nFantasy Impact: See: Trey Benson.\n\nJones suffered a torn Achilles in the team's Week 10 loss to the Seahawks, ending his season.\n\nFantasy Impact: Jones filled a situational role for the Cardinals but his absence could provide additional run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.\n\nAdams played through the hamstring strain without suffering a reported re-injury in Week 14. He aggravated the injury in the team's Week 15 win and was unable to finish the game. He is doubtful for Week 16 against the Seahawks on Thursday night.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Sean McVay told reporters Monday that Adams could be a game-time decision for Week 16. It would appear to be highly unlikely that Adams plays on a short week, potentially setting up an offensive game plan built around 13-personnel. Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua referred to wide receiver Konata Mumphield as Adams' \"apprentice.\" Mumphield could warrant boom-bust FLEX consideration, though he has no fantasy floor.\n\nHigbee was placed on injured reserve after suffering an ankle injury in the team's Week 11 win over the Seahawks.\n\nFantasy Impact: Higbee's absence for much of the game against the Seahawks simply allowed rookie Terrance Ferguson to step into additional snaps as opposed to forcing the team to move away from their league-leading 13-personnel rates. Colby Parkinson should be viewed as the team's starter. Davis Allen is capable as well. The Panthers struggle to cover opposing tight ends.\n\nPearsall injured both his knee and ankle in the team's Week 15 win.\n\nFantasy Impact: Head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters on Monday that \"there is concern\" about Pearsall's injuries. Missed time could force Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson into increased run.\n\nHead coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Aiyuk's 21-day practice window ahead of a Week 11 meeting with the Cardinals. The same was said for Week 12, and now Week 13. Reports then surfaced that Aiyuk and the 49ers are \"headed for divorce\" after the team voided his 2025 guarantees.\n\nFantasy Impact: A mostly lost season for Aiyuk appears to be quickly approaching, at least as far as fantasy is concerned.\n\nArroyo is \"out right now\" with a knee injury.\n\nFantasy Impact: The injury allows tight end AJ Barner to assume a full-time role.\n\nHorton was added to the injury report Thursday with multiple ailments and did not play in Week 10 against the Cardinals. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Friday and remains sidelined early in Week 12. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.\n\nFantasy Impact: It's unfortunate timing for the blazing rookie after his breakout performance in Week 9.",

    "fullText": "Buccaneers' Mike Evans doesn't hold back on brutal thoughts on offense originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers are still annoyed that they let Thursday night's game slip through their fingers.\n\nUp 28-14 in the fourth quarter against the Atlanta Falcons, the offense stumbled, and the defense couldn't get a stop as Kirk Cousins led a superb comeback that embarrassed the Buccaneers.\n\nWith plenty of blame to go around on both sides of the ball, with Todd Bowles' defense horrific, and Baker Mayfield and Co. unable to score enough points.\n\nFor Mike Evans, who marked his return to the team with a monster 132-yard game, does he think the unit has to score more than 28 points each week?\n\n“Absolutely,” Evans said. “As a offense, especially with the amount of talented players that we have, we're going to go out there and put up way more than that. Especially after we watch film and see how much meat we left on the bone, it's unacceptable for offense of this caliber.”\n\nMore:Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield has pointed message for Todd Bowles doubters\n\nYou could make that case, but every offense wants to score touchdowns on every single drive, but that isn't reality.\n\nIn truth, 28 points should have been more than enough for the Buccaneers to beat the Falcons, and as far as Evans saying 28 points is unacceptable for the offense, looking around the league, Tampa Bay should be happy with that.\n\nOnly six teams average 28 points or more per game.\n\nSo, it isn't an easy thing to do week in, week out, but that is the standard given the abundance of weapons on the offensive side of the ball.\n\nAt least we know the pass mark this week in Carolina for the Buccaneers -- score more than 28 points.\n\nBaker Mayfield shoulders blame for Buccaneers' collapse against Falcons\n\nBucky Irving's frustrating lack of usage near goal line explained by Bucs reporter\n\nTodd Bowles points finger after Bucs' loss to Falcons and it wasn't at the coaches\n\nBuccaneers vs. Falcons final score, results: Kirk Cousins, Falcons storm back from 14-point deficit to shock Buccaneers",

    "fullText": "Today, a new round of the Copa del Rey was played, and we truly experienced it all. As always, at OneFootball, we bring you the star, the surprise, and the disappointment.\n\nAfter his goal against Alavés, the Frenchman started as a key player against Talavera today, continuing his pursuit of Cristiano Ronaldo's goal record.\n\nToday, he scored another double in a match where he didn't shine, but he remains incredibly lethal.\n\nWithout a doubt, the big surprises happened today. Albacete knocked out Celta on penalties, and Cultural Leonesa did it in regular time against Levante.\n\nOn the other hand, the great hero was Racing de Santander, who eliminated the third-placed team in LaLiga from the Copa del Rey. With these three eliminations, we now have eight top-tier teams knocked out.\n\nUndoubtedly, the season for the red and whites is more than irregular, and today they provided another example of it.\n\nCoudet's team stood up to Almeyda's and ended up eliminating them from the Copa del Rey thanks to Vicente's goal from the penalty spot.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker: 'Suggesting the Bears would move to Indiana is a startling slap in the face to all the beloved and loyal fans'",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears released an open letter to fans Wednesday night that said the franchise is considering Northwest Indiana as a location for a new stadium.\n\nThe team has been seeking tax breaks and nearly $900 million in public funding, according to media reports, to build a stadium in Cook County, the most recent target being Arlington Heights, a Chicago suburb. But Bears President and CFO Kevin Warren said in the letter the team is not receiving a \"sense of urgency or appreciation to date\" from the state.\n\n\"We have been told directly by state leadership our project will not be a priority in 2026,\" Warren said. “Consequently, in addition to Arlington Park, we need to expand our search and critically evaluate opportunities throughout the wider Chicagoland region, including Northwest Indiana.\n\n“This is not about leverage. We spent years trying to build a new home in Cook County. ... Our fans deserve a world-class stadium. Our players and coaches deserve a venue that matches the championship standard they strive for every day. With that in mind, our organization must keep every credible pathway open to deliver that future.\"\n\nGov. JB Pritzker didn't hold back in his response Warren offering Indiana as an option for the Bears.\n\n“Suggesting the Bears would move to Indiana is a startling slap in the face to all the beloved and loyal fans who have been rallying around the team during this strong season,” a Pritzker spokesman said in a statement to the Chicago Sun-Times. “The Governor’s a Bears fan who has always wanted them to stay in Chicago. He has also said that ultimately they are a private business that makes their own decisions, but the Governor has also been clear that the bottom line for any private business development should not come at the full expense of taxpayers.”\n\nIn a letter to season-ticket holders, #Bears president/CEO Kevin Warren says Illinois state leadership told the team its proposed stadium in Arlington Heights won’t be a priority in 2026. \n\nWarren says, consequently, the team will expand its search, including Northwest Indiana. pic.twitter.com/EWTEsriRSv\n\n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) December 17, 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Chicago Bears moving: Team considering Northwest Indiana for stadium",

    "description": "Jarred Vanderbilt sparked the Lakers' defensive effort in the win over Phoenix on Sunday, but they'll need their stars to contribute as well against Utah.",
    "fullText": "They saw how “contagious” it was when playing defense at a high level against the Suns and how Jarred Vanderbilt lit the fuse to ignite things for the Lakers in their last victory over Phoenix.\n\nAnd for the Lakers to maintain that defensive mindset, stars Luka Doncic and LeBron James also have to be committed to that end of the court.\n\nThat was the message from Lakers coach JJ Redick to Doncic and James.\n\n\"Yeah, it was good,\" Doncic said. \"We talked about a lot, not just that, but he was right. You got to get a little big more, especially from the star players. So that's on us. That's on me. And we just got to give more, especially at the start of the game. We got to start the game better. But I think in Phoenix, we did a pretty good job. The plan was focused on ourselves and [our] defensive mentality, so I think we did a pretty good job.\"\n\nThe Lakers will be tested again on defense by the Utah Jazz Thursday night in Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Jazz have a developing star in Lauri Markkanen, a difficult matchup at 7-foot-1 who is ninth in the NBA in scoring at 27.8 points per game, and a young talent in guard Keyonte George, who is averaging 23.5 points and 6.8 assists.\n\nUtah is fourth in the league in pace (102.98), ninth in scoring (119.0), second in assists (29.8). The Jazz are fifth in rebounds (45.7), eighth in offensive rebounds (12.6), and 12th in field-goal percentage.\n\n\"The way we play, we got to approach every game the same,\" Doncic said. \"In the NBA, every team is dangerous, so at some point somebody can go for 40. They have Markkanen, and then George. They can go for 40 on any night. So we just got to work on ourselves and approach the game, make everything the same.\"\n\nThe all-out energy and effort by Vanderbilt off the bench was the catalyst for the Lakers against the Suns.\n\nIn his 15 minutes of action, he had seven ponits, seven rebounds, two steals and one blocked shot.\n\nVanderbilt had played only three minutes and eight seconds over a 10-game stretch prior to that point.\n\n“Vando's minutes were huge,” Gabe Vincent said. “He came in and does what we all know he's very capable of doing and being disruptive on the defensive end, crashing the glass, getting extra possessions for us, all of which we desperately needed. You know what I mean? So his spark off the bench was huge for us.\"\n\nNow it’s about sustaining that defensive intensity, the Lakers say. And about playing with that physicality, the Lakers say.\n\n“Yeah, when you guys asked me this the last time, it’s effort,” Jake LaRavia said. “If we just go out there and we give that kind of effort every night…We got a lot of guys on the team. Some guys might not be having it and, like you said about that contagious word, that really helps out. (Marcus) Smart does it sometimes. Vando does it sometimes. I would say I do it just being a contagious type of person to help lead the team and just being extra physical.”\n\nThe Lakers are ranked near the bottom of the league in some defensive categories, which means there remains room for improvement.\n\nThey are ranked 17th in the league in points allowed (116.7), 24th in field-goal percentage (48.1%) allowed and 28th in three-point shooting (38.1%) allowed.\n\n“You just got to go out there and do it,” LaRavia said. “It’s not anything a coach can say. It’s not anything a player can tell another player. Yeah, it’s like the individual player’s job to go out there and give effort on defense and that’s contagious. It just goes around.”\n\nLakers center Deandre Ayton on Wednesday was named by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Assn. as the winner of the Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for November. Ayton was recognized for his philanthropic work across the Bahamas, which is his home country, Jamaica and Los Angeles through the Ayton Family Foundation.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

And it could have been more...\n\nIn the Intercontinental final against PSG, Jorginho even converted the penalty that took the match to extra time and penalties.\n\nThe midfielder, however, was substituted at the 28th minute of the second half.

    "fullText": "Scarlet Knights across a wide variety of fall and winter sports earned recognition this past week, headlined by national podium finishes, conference and national honors, and academic acknowledgements. This includes preseason, midseason, and postseason awards, watch lists, and national medals.\n\nRutgers divers Bailee Sturgill and Katerina Hoffman had a standout showing at the 2025 USA Diving Winter Nationals, teaming up to earn a silver medal in the synchronized platform event with a second-place score of 488.91. Additionally, Sturgill added a second silver medal on synchronized 3M, as she teamed up with Lilly Witte of Indiana. The duo had a final score of 528.12, trailing the winning duo by roughly 31 points.\n\nSturgill and Witte won the synchronized 3M event in May during the USA Diving Nationals, but were unable to go back-to-back. Sturgill also competed on the 3M dive, while Hoffman also competed in the 1M and 3M events.\n\nSturgill was previously named the Big Ten Diver of the Week after winning the 3M dive against Princeton in November. She currently holds a spot on Rutgers’ all-time top-10 list in the 1M, 3M, and platform dive.\n\nAt the 2025 Winter Junior Nationals, Emilana Gonzalez finished fifth in the 50-meter freestyle at the East Regionals on the campus of Indiana University. She posted a time of 22.40, which was the second-fastest time in Rutgers program history. Several other Rutgers signees competed at the US Junior Nationals, as the Scarlet Knights recently announced a talented eight-person class.\n\nStar running back Antwan Raymond picked up a major college football award, winning the Cornish Trophy as the most outstanding Canadian player in NCAA football. He was also named a semifinalist for the Doak Walker National Running Back Award. Safety Jett Elad was also named as one of the five finalists for the award.\n\nRutgers football previously earned key All-Big Ten honors as star wideout KJ Duff and Raymond were selected Second Team All-Big Ten by both coaches and media. In addition, OL Kwabena Asamoah, WR Ian Strong, and DB Bo Mascoe were selected as Big Ten Honorable Mentions by coaches and media.\n\nElad and placekicker Jai Patel were selected by conference coaches as Big Ten Honorable Mentions, while the media selected punter Jakob Anderson and linebacker Dariel Djabome for the same honors. Offensive lineman Gus Zilinskas was also given the Big Ten Sportsmanship Award.\n\nRutgers star defender Puck Winter was named a 2025 Second Team All-American by the NFHCA yesterday after recording 31 defensive saves as a four-year starter for the Scarlet Knights. She scored 17 career goals with four assists for 38 points, with five goals, three assists, and six defensive saves in 2025, ranking second in the Big Ten and fifth nationally. Winter was also previously named the National Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nEarlier this offseason, Puck Winter and captain Paulina Niklaus were also named First Team All-Mid-Atlantic Region, First Team All-Big Ten, and First Team All-ECAC. Olivia de Zwaan, Emily Nicholls, and Martha Goodridge won Freshman of the Week during the season, with Nicholls and Winter also earning Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week.\n\nGraduate student Emily Leese and senior Gabrielle Dildy were each named Big Ten Gymnasts to watch by the conference on Tuesday. Dildy made the list for the second straight year after a 2025 season in which she qualified as an individual on beam at the NCAA Regional Championships.\n\nHer score of 9.850 also helped Rutgers qualify for NCAA Regionals for the first time in 11 seasons. She earned several team awards, including Most Valuable Gymnast, and led the Scarlet Knights with a 9.850 on floor and 9.800 on vault at the conference meet last season. She has career highs of 9.900 on vault, beam, and floor.\n\nLeese is ready to make her return to competition after missing the 2025 season rehabbing from injury. She owns the program record in the vault with a 9.925, which Leese accomplished in both 2023 and 2024. She qualified for the 2023 NCAA Regionals on vault and boasts a 9.925 career high on floor and a 9.850 on beam. She is also a team captain for the second straight year and has a multitude of academic Big Ten honors to her name.\n\nRutgers will open their 2026 season with a tri-meet shortly after the New Year, hosting Temple and Brockport at Jersey Mike’s Arena on January 4th.\n\nRutgers also celebrated academic excellence this week with 141 student-athletes named to the 2025 Fall Academic All-Big Ten list, representing a wide range of programs, including football and other fall varsity sports.\n\nCassidy Kidd (women’s cross country), Graham Kois (men’s soccer), and Rachel Quigley (women’s soccer) were highlighted on the Big Ten’s list for their perfect 4.0 GPAs. 65 football players were named to the list, including Sean Cooper, Bryan Felter, Henry Hughes Jr., Tyler Needham, Michael O’Connor, and Gus Zilinskas, who earned the honor four times as Rutgers student-athletes.\n\nEach of the 141 student-athletes was on a fall varsity team, enrolled full-time at the institution for a minimum of 12 months, and received a cumulative term GPA of 3.0 or higher, showing the university’s commitment to balancing strong athletics and academics.\n\nTo support me and my work, please follow @arnavsarkar100 on X!",

When asked for his prediction, Paul kept it bold and simple: \"It’s going to be the biggest upset in sports history.\"\n\nPaul doubled down on his prediction, comparing his impending victory to the monumental Giants-Patriots Super Bowl upset of 2007 and dramatically calling the event \"the Boston Tea Party 2.0.\" As always, he was not afraid to say what was on his mind, providing some soundbite-worthy moments throughout the night.\n\nMeanwhile, the veteran Joshua— stepping back into the ring after a September 2024 loss to Daniel Dubois— remained composed, focusing on his professional approach.The tension was palpable when Joshua's viral quote, \"If I can kill him, I’ll kill him,\" was brought up; he had an icy calm response, stating simply, \"It’s my job.\"\n\nFinally, as the two faced off, it was exactly what fans came to expect: a smaller, confident Paul against a silent former heavyweight champion of the world.

    "fullText": "MIAMI, Fla. — Thursday, Cardinal Newman (West Palm Beach) pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the 2025 FHSAA state championships. The Crusaders took down four-time defending state champions Chaminade-Madonna (Hollywood) in a 17-14 victory.\n\nThe leader of the Newman defense was three-star LB Adam Balogoun-Ali, who ended his high school career in the best possible way.\n\n“There’s no better way to end it,” Balogoun-Ali said after the win. “It’s not even a bittersweet feeling—just pure joy. I love my guys. I’m so glad we could get this done.”\n\nChaminade was the favorite going into the game, but Newman proved that any team can win on any given day.\n\n“It’s just a jersey. It’s just a name. They’re not the same team that they were. We knew if we came in and punched them in the mouth, we could win this game, and that’s what happened.”\n\nThe Benjamin School transfer feels he’s grown exponentially in his senior year at Newman and credits head coach Jack Daniels with instilling a culture that laid the foundation for the school’s first state championship.\n\n“This is a more complicated defense. I would say the biggest thing I learned was how to take in all the info really fast, especially when [offenses] are going quickly, as Chaminade did. I think learning the [college] playbook will be much easier now that I’ve come to Newman this year.\n\n“Coach Jack Daniels ‘ culture that he set at Cardinal Newman is superb. It’s unlike anything I’ve been a part of, and I’m really glad could learn from it.”\n\nAhead of the state title game, the Auburn signee received some motivational words from the newly formed Tiger staff.\n\n“The whole staff has been really supportive. They were telling me it’s just another game and to do me.”\n\nAuburn defensive coordinator DJ Durkin, who was instrumental in landing Balogoun-Ali’s signing, was retained by the program, much to the delight of the Tiger signee.\n\n“This is why I went to Auburn. I want to be coached by him. I really believe in what he does development-wise and scheme-wise. I think we are going to do great things over there at Auburn.”\n\nThe 6-foot-1, 210-pound backer is confident with his signing with Auburn and believes in what new head coach Alex Golesh is building on the Plains.\n\n“There was a lot of doubt about where people were going and all that, but personally, with me, I’m excited. I think it’s going to be a good time. With Coach Golesh as our new head coach, I think our offense will get going a lot, and our defense is already elite. I think in one or two years we’ll be a top team.”",

Because a loss would nearly be the end of Baltimore's playoff chances via the AFC North, especially if the Pittsburgh Steelers win.\n\nGiven that Pittsburgh has to tackle the Detroit Lions, it is all on the line for the Ravens to put all the pressure on the Steelers by beating the Patriots.\n\nBut tight end Mark Andrews isn't looking too far ahead; he's focused on Sunday.\n\n“We're trying to take it week by week,” Andrews said. “Obviously, a very important game and we're not overlooking that aspect.”\n\nMore:Ravens' John Harbaugh reveals 'bottom line' to playoff hopes | Sporting News\n\nThe 24-0 win over the Cincinnati Bengals was perhaps one of the best games from the Ravens this season.\n\nThe defense pitched a shutout, but the offense was efficient, with Lamar Jackson making only 12 pass attempts (completing 8), so more of that against New England will be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nBut can the Ravens carry over last week's performance and bring it against New England?\n\nI think so,\" Andrews added. \"We're going to continue to build on what this team could do, being efficient, playing great football, all those good things.

He ran for 523 yards this season.\n\nMohammed spent the last two seasons in Seattle and took on a larger role in 2025. He took 106 carries for 523 yards and five touchdowns as a sophomore and had 17 receptions for 138 yards in the passing game.\n\nAs a freshman in 2024, Adam Mohammed ran for 193 yards while adding 41 receiving yards. A product of Glendale (Ariz.) Apollo, he will have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nWashington put together a strong second season under Jedd Fisch in 2025, completing a 9-4 campaign with a victory over Boise State in the LA Bowl last week. Quarterback Demond Williams shined in his first year as the full-time starter, completing 69.5% of his passes for 3,065 yards and 25 touchdowns, to eight interceptions. He also added 611 rush yards and six touchdowns on the ground.\n\nAfterward, Fisch discussed the importance of keeping core players in tact as he gets ready for Year 3. He said the goal is to maintain as much continuity as possible on the roster, and he specifically pointed to Williams’ importance given the way he played throughout the year.\n\n“I thought, if you look at Raiden Vines probably had his first touchdown, he’s a freshman,” Fisch said in his LA Bowl press conference. “Dezmen Roebuck back had his seventh touchdown of the season. He’s a freshman. Demond played elite. He’s a sophomore. We play with probably the most freshmen in all of college football. Plays that were being made by guys were all young players. Players for the most part that all have eligibility left.\n\n“Our goal obviously is to bring back as many players as we possibly can. I think our guys know that we’ve got a great season coming ahead of us. We’ve got a great team. They’re led by an elite player. When you have an elite quarterback, you’ve got a great opportunity to win a lot of games.”",

    "fullText": "Venezuela’s government has ordered its Navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, escalating the risk of a confrontation with the United States after President Trump ordered a “blockade” aimed at the country’s oil industry.\n\nSeveral ships sailed from the country’s east coast with a naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, according to three people familiar with the matter. The vessels departed just hours after Mr. Trump said he intended to blockade sanctioned oil tankers that do business with Venezuela.\n\nThe ships — transporting urea, petroleum coke and other oil-based products — left the Port of José bound for Asian markets, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The Venezuelan government imposed the military escort in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, they said.\n\nVessels traveling with the escort did not appear on a current list of U.S. sanctioned ships, making it unclear whether they could be subject to Mr. Trump’s blockade. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he was focused on oil tankers that have violated U.S. trade sanctions.\n\nThe third person familiar with the matter, a U.S. official, said Washington was aware of escorts and was considering various courses of action, but declined to provide details.\n\nVenezuela’s state oil company, known as PDVSA, said in a statement on Wednesday that ships connected to its operations were continuing to sail “with full security, technical support and operational guarantees in legitimate exercise of their right to free navigation.”\n\nMr. Trump had announced on Tuesday evening that he was imposing a “total and complete blockade” of tankers to and from Venezuela that had violated U.S. trade sanctions. Roughly 40 percent of the tankers that have transported Venezuelan crude in recent years have been placed under U.S. sanctions, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials last week seized an Asia-bound sanctioned tanker carrying nearly two million barrels of Venezuelan crude, a major escalation of Mr. Trump’s standoff with Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, whose government derives the bulk of its revenues from oil exports.\n\nU.S. officials have said in private in recent days that additional tankers carrying Venezuelan oil may be seized, without providing additional details.\n\nMr. Maduro has reacted to the seizure with anger and vowed to keep the oil exports flowing at all cost, said one of the three people.\n\nNicholas Nehamas and Rebecca F.

    "title": "Trump Administration Aims to Strip More Foreign-Born Americans of Citizenship",
    "description": "An official with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would prioritize “those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration plans to ramp up efforts to strip some naturalized Americans of their citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times, marking an aggressive new phase in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe guidance, issued on Tuesday to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, asks that they “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year. If the cases are successful, it would represent a massive escalation of denaturalization in the modern era, experts said. By comparison, between 2017 and this year to date, there had been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department.\n\nUnder federal law, people may be denaturalized only if they committed fraud while applying for citizenship, or in a few other narrow circumstances. But the Trump administration has shown a zeal for using every tool at its disposal to target legal and illegal immigrants, leading activists to warn that such a campaign could sweep up people who had made honest mistakes on their citizenship paperwork and sow fear among law-abiding Americans.\n\nThe guidance comes as Mr. Trump has spent much of this year closing loopholes in the immigration system and throwing up roadblocks for people seeking to enter and stay in the country. The sweeping campaign, which has gone further than purging the country of unlawful migrants, has included blocks on asylum at the southern border, a pause on asylum applications inside the United States, and a ban on entry for travelers from predominantly African and Middle Eastern nations. Officials say their actions will make the country safer and preserve the country’s values\n\nA targeted campaign to increase the number of American immigrants stripped of their citizenship represents an escalation of an already ambitious campaign.\n\n“It’s no secret that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ war on fraud includes prioritizing those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship — especially under the previous administration,” said Matthew J. Tragesser, a U.S.C.I.S. spokesman. “We will pursue denaturalization proceedings for those individuals lying or misrepresenting themselves during the naturalization process. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”\n\nIn interviews, some former agency officials expressed concern at the scale of the case goals for denaturalization pushed by U.S.C.I.S. leadership.\n\n“Imposing arbitrary numerical targets on denaturalization cases risks politicizing citizenship revocation,” said Sarah Pierce, a former U.S.C.I.S. official. “And requiring monthly quotas that are 10 times higher than the total annual number of denaturalizations in recent years turns a serious and rare tool into a blunt instrument and fuels unnecessary fear and uncertainty for the millions of naturalized Americans.”\n\nProponents of stricter immigration laws said it was necessary to more aggressively root out people who had been improperly granted citizenship.\n\n“I don’t think we’re anywhere close to denaturalizing too many people,” said Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors restrictive immigration policies. Mr. Krikorian said that the country was “so far from denaturalizing” enough people that such an effort would not pull in people who should not be targeted.\n\nThere are about 26 million naturalized Americans in the country, according to the Census Bureau. More than 800,000 new citizens were sworn in last year, most of whom were born in Mexico, India, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic or Vietnam, U.S.C.I.S. statistics show. Most people stripped of their citizenship revert to being legal permanent residents.\n\nThe new guidance on Tuesday was part of a document laying out U.S.C.I.S. priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October. Listed alongside such goals as “provide employee feedback opportunities” and “strengthen management of high-risk cases” was “pursue denaturalization.”\n\nThe Justice Department previously also said it would make denaturalization a priority this year. In a memo distributed in the summer, officials laid out their approach, saying they would target individuals in an array of categories beyond committing fraud in obtaining citizenship. Categories of eligible people include gang members, those who committed financial fraud, individuals connected to drug cartels and violent criminals, according to the department.\n\n“The civil division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,” the agency wrote in June.\n\nU.S.C.I.S. is a key player in the process of denaturalization. The agency refers cases to the Justice Department, which must go through a federal court to strip someone of their citizenship. The process can occur either through a civil or a criminal proceeding. During a civil case, government lawyers must have “unequivocal evidence” that someone obtained citizenship illegally or hid a material fact during the process.\n\nBecause the government must go through a challenging court process, denaturalization cases have been rare since the 1990s. A Bloomberg Law analysis found that denaturalization cases brought by the government since then peaked in 2018, when 90 criminal and civil cases were filed. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that citizenship and naturalization are too precious and fundamental to our democracy for the government to take it away on their whim. Instead of wasting resources digging through Americans’ files, U.S.C.I.S. should do its job of processing applications, as Congress mandated,” said Amanda Baran, a former senior U.S.C.I.S. official in the Biden administration.\n\nMr. Trump stepped up denaturalizations in his first term as well. In one widely publicized case, a New Jersey man born in India, Baljinder Singh, was stripped of his citizenship after the Justice Department found that he had arrived in the country without travel documents or proof of identity and that he had used a different name.\n\nThis year, the Justice Department has brought 13 denaturalization cases and won eight of them, according to Chad Gilmartin, an agency spokesman. Mr. Gilmartin said in a social media post earlier this year that there had been over 100 cases filed to the courts during the first Trump administration, compared with 24 during the Biden administration. In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must prove not only that someone had lied during the citizenship application process but that the lie had an impact on the underlying citizenship claim.\n\nExperts said that despite the ramp-up in referrals, the process to actually denaturalize someone would likely remain quite difficult, raising questions on whether the government will actually be able to get many cases through.\n\nStill, some had concerns about what the guidance could portend.\n\n“My fear would be that as we have seen in the arrest and removal context when D.H.S. employees are given arbitrary targets what happens is people who shouldn’t be swept up, get swept up and that you’re going to see that happening to people in this context as well,” said Margy O’Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy organization. “That could incite fear and terror amongst naturalized citizens.”",

    "fullText": "How can you possibly squeeze a 32-bit PlayStation CD ROM game into a small Game Boy Color Cartridge? Well, HotGen would attempt to do just that with a conversion of Resident Evil in mid-1999 and to make it as close as possible with similar 3D perspectives using scaled sprites.\n\nThere were delays and a lot of struggles to cram everything in. There were of course a number of restrictions and tweaks made along the way, but HotGen had a pretty decent stab at it and had a title which was certainly pushing the 8-bit hardware.\n\nRetained were the original game’s locations, viewpoints, puzzles, pre-rendered backgrounds and dialogue. Characters and enemies were software-scaled, with technical compromises required due to the GBC’s limited CPU power and storage. Speech was replaced with text windows, but the structure of the PlayStation original remained largely intact.\n\nWhen we spoke to developer Nigel Speight as part of our book coverage in 2020, he had the following recollections about the development:\n\n“If I remember correctly I would say the game was about 75-85% complete. Originally the game was supposed to be about 35% of the original PlayStation version and we were going to elongate the storyline to keep reusing the rooms. However, as time went along Virgin kept upping the cartridge size and wanting more of the original content in. If I remember correctly I’d created an editor that allowed the 3d to be aligned to the screens and objects placed etc and I think that the last build we made didn’t include the final amount of content me and the artist Martin Smith had created.”\n\nThe game had been shown at places like E3 in 1999, and had been planned for release by the Christmas of that year – though delays meant it slipped into early 2000. By February 2000, the game was nearing completion and was being tested. However, Capcom decided to cancel the title, feeling that the game wasn’t up to scratch.\n\nAssistant programmer Pete Frith (back in 2020 when questioned by us) couldn’t recall the completion state, but felt it was more 98% finished, as there was a lot of communications between the team and QA testers at the end. He also recalls that the story they were told regarding the cancellation, was that the original creator of Resident Evil didn’t feel the GBC was worthy of his creation, and that he had personally instructed the cancellation. He also informed that the lead artist Martin Smith had sadly passed away.\n\nWhere Martin focused on the backgrounds, Simon Butler did the sprite work on the game. Mark Cooksey was then on hand to create all the music and sound effects, though many would not get properly integrated it seems.\n\nThankfully, in 2011 – two separate builds were preserved thanks to Kiff Storey and Bowker. One version was quite near to completion, but was missing intro titles and had debug screens on and was felt to be around 90% complete. A long-play online confirmed that the game wasn’t completable either for both characters.\n\nIn late 2025 however, Games That Weren’t have now preserved a final version of game at the point of cancellation and we have it here for you today to check out thanks to Pete Frith providing everything. Again, it isn’t 100% complete (perhaps now 98% – based on Pete’s estimates) – but there is more content and it *might* actually now be completable. Due to time constraints, we’ve not been able to sit and play through the title fully to confirm, as there might be scenes that glitch/bug out – if you find that it is, please do let us know!\n\nCrucially, we know that the Tyrant seems to be present at the end (see below) and its possible to trigger the end sequence compared to the earlier builds. We have a hack further below that jumps you near the end, so that you can see this for yourself.\n\nThe debug data present in other builds has been removed in the final build, and there are a set of introduction credit screens present in this version. Also, hacking through the game – the end sequences are in place too, which gives promise that the game may be completable in its current final state. Just in case it isn’t, we’ve created a few hacks which allow the following to unlock some unseen content:\n\n1) ResiEvilHack-EndingSelector: This allows you to just select either character and jump straight to the end sequences for both.\n\n2) ResiEvilHack-TyrantSegments: This hack jumps near towards the end of the game, where the tyrant is now walking around the final outside scene if you select Chris Redfield. If you select Jill Valentine, it starts you in the lab with the tyrant moving around (though its just their silloette).\n\nYou can’t seem to kill the Tyrant with the knife with Chris (though you might be able to find a weapon nearby). However, if you play with Jill and navigate towards the outside helicopter pad – the tyrant is there, and you can use your gun to kill them – triggering the end sequence.\n\n3) ResiEvilHack-SceneNMusicPlayer: This is quite a cool hack. Firstly, if you select either character – it will play through all the animated scenes for that player in sequence. It is likely there will be a few scenes here which were not used in the game or integrated. Then if you press “B” on the same selector screen, you will be able to play through all the SFX and pressing “SELECT” will cycle through all the tunes created by Mark Cooksey.\n\nIn a note found to the developers, Mark listed all the music and SFX as follows (with his original descriptions):\n\n0 Silence tune (Skipped in selector)\n 1 Long Background tune #1\n 2 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #1\n 3 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #2 *modified tune *\n 4 Short Dramatic Danger Loop tune #3 *new tune to replace old one *\n 5 Short Dramatic danger loop tune #4 * modified tune *\n 6 BG00 from res evil\n 7 Long Background tune #2\n 8 Long Background tune #3\n 9 Moonlight sonata correct\n 10 Moonlight sonata played badly correct\n 11 Long background tune #4\n 12 Girly end of game tune * new tune *\n\n0 Police card (char) select\n 1 Option move from one to another\n 2 select (highlight option)\n 3 Cancel\n 4 Wooden door open\n 5 Wooden door close\n 6 clock ticking VERSION 1 Looping\n 7 Stop clock 1 ticking\n 8 clock ticking VERSION 2 BETTER THAN 1 Lp\n 9 Stop clock 2 ticking\n 10 Footstep #1 on carpet\n 11 Single hard footstep\n 12 Double footstep #1 Gravel use together\n 13 Double footstep #2 left foot then RFoot\n 14 Long Footstep for wading through water\n 15 Gun shot #1 n\n 16 Gun shot #2\n 17 Knife swipe 1 Shorter\n 18 Knife swipe 2 Longer\n 19 Zombie Moan 1 (1 channel fx)\n 20 Zombie Moan 2 (2 channel fx more real)\n 21 Zombie Chomp (bite)\n 22 Teleprinter type sound 1 shot\n 23 Go on to next screen after pick char\n 24 Page Turn\n 25 Gun Reload 1 REVOLVER\n 26 Gun reload 2 Shotgun\n 27 Gun Reload 3 ???\n 28 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 29 Gun shot #3 RIFLE/SHOTGUN\n 30 Bloke Aaah being attacked.\n 31 Girl Aaah being attacked.\n 32 Push Furniture (continuous)\n 33 Stop push furniture\n 34 Bees\n 35 Break stone\n 36 Gate Noise\n 37 Lift start (loops)\n 38 Lift stop\n 39 Key open (key apar)\n 40 Power on\n 41 Computer key click\n\nIn addition to this, we have extracted out a set of assets used for the game – which may contain sprites/sequences not used in the final game. Also, the original WAV samples that Pete Frith created from his voice to make the speech on the title screen – including some versions that were not used :)\n\nWhat else have we established so far?\n\nIf you spot anything else – please feel free to get in touch or leave something in the comments and we’ll update the page over time. For now, we hope you enjoy taking a look at what has been recovered and enjoy the findings so far. We have also included two bonus builds that we also located which will have some minor differences too.\n\nWith a huge thank you to Pete Frith for allowing us to preserve and for the assets and to Nigel Speight for his recollections.",

    "fullText": "As a developer, a version control system is a critical part of your toolkit, no matter the size of the project or team you may find yourself working on.\n\nI first started learning to use git by applying it to my own projects and maintaining local repositories to track those projects. From there I moved on to hosting and storing my git repositories at Bitbucket while still working independently. My first experience with working alongside other developers in git came at my first full time development job on a small team (think tiny — two developers, myself included). I picked up the basics of branching, handling merges, developing different features in parallel and, ultimately, dealing with QA and production deployments that were sourced from various branches in our project repository.\n\nI've expanded on my knowledge git in the jobs I've held since that first position and have used svn pretty heavily as well (I don't mind it, but I don't love it — I'd argue git is the better choice for a number of reasons, its decentralized nature and flexibility being chief among them).\n\nOne of the many appeals of git is its flexibility and there are a wide range of commands that come with it. To get started, I'd suggest digging in with the following:\n\nEach of these commands has numerous options associated with it and allows for broad control over the flow and history of your project. There are a number of other options I'd suggest for learning more about git:",

    "fullText": "Creators and publishers have long worried about Meta's ability to throttle links to outside content. Now, the company is testing out a new scheme that effectively puts link-sharing behind a paywall for creators on Facebook.\n\nUnder the test, a Meta Verified subscription will determine how many links a creator can share another profile per month. According to a screenshot shared by social meda consultant Matt Navarra, creators in the test recently received a notification from Meta informing them that \"certain Facebook profiles without Meta Verified, including yours, will be limited to sharing links in 2 organic posts per month.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Meta confirmed the test to Engadget. The test is currently affecting an unspecified number of creators and pages using \"professional mode\" on Facebook. Publishers aren't affected for now. \"This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhile Meta seems to be trying to downplay the significance of the test, it's a notable shift for the company. Many creators and businesses rely on Facebook and reducing their ability to send traffic to outside websites could be a significant hit. Many creators are already frustrated that the company puts its better customer service features behind the Meta Verified subscription, which starts at $14.99/month. Making link-sharing a premium feature as well would be even more unpopular.\n\nHave a tip for Karissa?

    "description": "UCLA study finds gut microbes are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.",
    "fullText": "Gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, UCLA evolutionary biologists report in a new study. The researchers found that gene variants that help microbes digest starches found in ultra-processed foods have “swept” the genomes of some species of gut bacteria in industrialized parts of the world. Because these starches are industrially produced and have only been around for a few decades, scientists believe natural selection must have been acting strongly to make these genes dominant so quickly. What’s more, the researchers have discovered that bacteria are evolving differently in industrialized and non-industrialized parts of the world.\n\nThe study’s findings, published in Nature, scanned the genomes of almost three dozen species of gut bacteria using data from around the world and identified a process called horizontal gene transfer, in which bacteria transfer DNA from one strain to another, as the mechanism for this rapid evolution. Horizontal gene transfer has previously been identified as the mechanism that allows bacteria to evolve antibiotic resistance so quickly, but the prevalence of this process in gut microbes has been relatively unknown until now.\n\n“The discovery that the ability to digest novel starches is a target of natural selection in gut bacteria is interesting, but we found an even more robust, stronger signal that there are different targets of selection across many genes and many species in industrialized and non-industrialized populations,” said UCLA doctoral student and paper first author Richard Wolff. “What are the gut microbiomes in industrialized populations responding to? We’ve picked out one example with these starches, but there’s likely many possibilities we haven’t grappled with yet.”\n\nWolff and corresponding author, UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Nandita Garud, developed a novel statistic that identifies locations in the DNA of 30 gut bacteria species where genes have risen to high frequency, or “swept,” in that species. The statistic looks for tiny regions of homogeneity against a backdrop of immense diversity separating different strains of the same species.\n\n“Different strains of E. coli, for example, have diverged from each other as much as humans have diverged from chimps, yet we call them the same species. Despite this diversity, there are still shared fragments of DNA present in many hosts — a hidden thread connecting our microbiomes,” said Garud.\n\nDifferent genes appeared to be selected for in industrialized and non-industrialized populations, and one gene in particular was sweeping only in industrialized populations. That gene is associated with the ability to digest maltodextrin, which is made from cornstarch and has been used in processed foods since the 1960s.\n\n“We saw the adaptive signal very strongly, but we can’t say for sure yet if it’s specializing in maltodextrin or a broader class of starch derivatives. There might be intermediate steps as the bacteria adapt to different starch sources,” said Wolff. “There are a lot of steps in between eating a diet full of cassava and breadfruit and a diet full of Hot Cheetos or something like that.”\n\nBacteria can take up DNA from their environment in many different ways: They can eat it; they can be infected by a virus that carries DNA between them; and it can be transmitted when bacteria clump together and form a bridge that allows them to move between each other.\n\nBut humans have only a few strains of the same species of gut bacteria, and these strains typically stay with each person for many years. So the pervasiveness of the newly discovered adaptation raises the question: How do DNA fragments become shared between individual humans?\n\n“Each person might have a couple of different strains of E. coli,” said Garud. “If fragments of DNA are transmitted horizontally across different strains in different hosts, and these strains seemingly are faithful to their respective hosts, where do they recombine? How do they move between individual people to become fixed in a whole population?”\n\nWhile the answer will emerge with future research, the discovery that gut bacteria evolve rapidly in response to different diets, and the possibility that novel starches may be exerting strong evolutionary pressure on them, suggest that careful attention to what we eat could play a more varied role in promoting good health than we think.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.",

    "title": "Is Cognitive Dissonance Actually a Thing?",
    "description": "A foundational 1956 study of the concept, focussed on a U.F.O. doomsday cult, has been all but debunked by new research.",
    "fullText": "Festinger was developing the now ubiquitous theory of cognitive dissonance. He argued that, when people encounter contradictions, they experience so much discomfort that they feel an urgent need to reduce it. In response, a person can update his views—or he can misinterpret, and even reject, whatever information has challenged his beliefs. He might seek out people who agree with him; he might try to persuade those who don’t. “A man with a conviction is a hard man to change,” Festinger later wrote. “Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.” Cognitive dissonance helped explain human choices that otherwise seemed irrational, stubborn, and shortsighted: these were, in fact, attempts to reduce psychological distress.\n\nIn 1954, while Festinger was refining his theory, he stumbled upon a rare opportunity to observe the effects of dissonance. A newspaper reported that a small Chicago-area group, the Seekers, were receiving messages from aliens about an impending flood that would submerge North America. Festinger and two colleagues, plus several assistants, went undercover. In an influential 1956 book, “When Prophecy Fails,” the trio wrote that the Seekers committed to the prediction so fully that some quit their jobs while emptying their savings accounts. When no flood or aliens arrived, Festinger and his colleagues wrote, the Seekers tried to reduce the dissonance they were experiencing by recommitting to their belief and evangelizing—a seeming attempt to bring others into alignment with their views. “Their research resulted in convincing, if not definitive, confirmation of their hypotheses,” a reviewer from the American Sociological Review wrote. In 1957, Festinger published another book, “A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance,” which described laboratory studies of people acting to resolve dissonance.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how influential the theory is today. “You almost certainly can’t get through an introductory psychology class without hearing about cognitive dissonance,” Adam Mastroianni, writer of the psychology Substack “Experimental History,” told me. The phrase has been invoked to explain why environmentalists eat meat and why some Trump supporters play down the President’s connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Last month, on social media, memes making fun of Cynthia Erivo, the lead actress in the “Wicked” films, for rushing to protect Ariana Grande from a fan, spread on social media. The musician SZA said that we’d eventually look back on these posts and experience cognitive dissonance.\n\nLately, though, the foundational case study of the Seekers has been contending with its own kind of dissonance. Until this year, a box of Festinger’s documents—communications with colleagues, research notes, transcribed telephone conversations—in his archives at the Bentley Historical Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, remained sealed at the request of his widow, Trudy. When the files were released, a political scientist named Thomas Kelly discovered that the researchers, who were ostensibly neutral observers, actually wielded a profound level of influence over the Seekers. In a recent peer-reviewed paper, Kelly noted that there were at least five paid observers in addition to the three researchers; at some Seekers meetings, half of those present may have been infiltrators. One research assistant pretended to dream about a flood and receive psychic messages; one of Festinger’s co-authors, Henry Riecken, was revered by the group’s leaders. When the flood didn’t come, Riecken apparently encouraged the Seekers to double down on their beliefs, Kelly told me in November. “Here’s this canonical study, and it’s backwards,” Kelly said. “This is misleading people about the dynamics of new religions and social psychology.”\n\nJoel Cooper, a psychologist at Princeton, remembered reading the study when he was an undergraduate. He was so surprised that he missed his subway stop. “That was unimaginable to the field of psychology at the time,” Cooper said. The prevailing dogma was that people, like Pavlov’s dogs, responded based on rewards. In this instance, those who were rewarded more said they liked the task less.",

    "fullText": "Cisco has decided its homegrown AI models are ready to power its products, starting with its Duo Identity Intelligence offering.\n\nThe model Cisco will use is called “Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct”. As described on the Hugging Face model-mart, it’s an open-weight, 8-billion-parameter instruction-tuned “Auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture,” namely Meta Llama-3.1-8B backbone.\n\nCisco tuned the model for cybersecurity applications and optimized it for three uses:\n\nIn a Tuesday post, Cisco revealed it’s using the model with Duo Identity Intelligence, a service that analyzes who logs on to networks, where they log on from, and which devices they use.\n\n“By examining post authentication signals, the system identifies patterns that traditional access controls often miss, including unusual geographic activity, abnormal privilege usage, and indications of MFA fatigue attempts or session hijacking,” Cisco explained.\n\nThe product alerts users to potential identity issues in a weekly email digest that Cisco will now compose with help from its new model.\n\n“Producing such a digest requires an artificial intelligence model that understands identity behavior, can interpret long chains of events, and communicates insights in a way that aligns with how security administrators make decisions,” Cisco’s post states, adding that general-purpose models “are not always tuned for the nuance and precision required for identity security and often introduce external dependencies.”\n\nUsing its own model, Cisco says, will deliver “summaries that are more accurate, more readable, and more aligned with real security workflows.”\n\nThe company also says the content of the digests will become “noticeably stronger … clearer and more consistent. Prioritization improves, making it easier to identify what demands immediate attention. Insights feel more relevant to each environment, and recommendations are expressed in a more actionable way.” Cisco reckons you’ll therefore end up using Identity Intelligence more often, because the model will produce info that demands action.\n\nThe improved digest is the result of collaboration between the teams that develop Duo and Cisco’s foundation models.\n\n“Both groups created a tuned prompt stack that significantly improved output quality and aligned the model with the analytical style expected in the digest,” Cisco’s post states.\n\nOver 2,000 Cisco customers receive the digest. If you’re one of them, let us know if the weekly email has improved!\n\nThe model can run on-prem or in the cloud, and do much more than write nice email digests. Cisco says its downstream uses include:\n\nIn early November, Cisco told The Register it’s working on a 17-billion parameter foundation model, and “a whole phalanx” of other AI. Foundation-Sec-1.1-8B-Instruct seems to come from the phalanx, as while it is a foundation model it is nine billion parameters short of the forthcoming model Cisco mentioned.®",

    "fullText": "As SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) eyes going public via an IPO in 2026, what would such a move mean for the space economy, which for the longest time has been dominated by private companies?\n\nSpace Capital founder and CEO Chad Anderson comes on Market Catalysts to elaborate on the spark this could give the space industry and how it could influence more private operators to go public.\n\nAnderson is also the author of The Space Economy: Capitalize on the Greatest Business Opportunity of Our Lifetime.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.\n\nFor more on what a potential SpaceX IPO means for other space companies looking to go public, as well as just a general landscape for next year, I'm joined here on set by Chad Anderson, Space Capital founder and CEO. He's also the author of The Space Economy. Good to see you.\n\nSo, I'm so curious about SpaceX and kind of like whether it sucks the air out of the room for other types of space investment or creates more of a halo effect for space investment.\n\nI think it's definitely the ladder. Um this is really exciting news. It's still uncertain, but we'll see what happens. But if they do, I mean, this is, I think this is going to um uh set a new benchmark. It's going to reprice um a lot of assets throughout the category. I think it's going to show what can be done. And I think it's going to kick off a wave of new listings. So this could be really exciting. And then from our perspective as private market investors in early companies, uh we're really excited to see what happens when these founders get some liquidity, who own stock options and shares, and they go on now and they're freed from the shackles of working at um big companies, they can go and, you know, um think about what they want to do, start their own thing. So we expect that this is going to um uh increase the SpaceX mafia. I mean, a few years ago it was, you know, we were tracking 45 companies or something like that of SpaceX alumni that had gone on and done founded new companies. It's now up to, I don't know, closer to 200, and we'll see what happens with with this um uh liquidity event. But for us, I mean, this is um uh SpaceX is the Apex player. They're 10 years ahead of anybody else. They've been setting the benchmark all along. Uh now this sort of moment, um we'll see what happens, but it could really catalyze a lot of activity.\n\nI mean, on the flip side, if they are so far ahead of everyone else, and then their numbers are public, does that then um mean that some of the other players, particularly in the public markets who also their numbers are public, like that that they're disadvantaged if they're not in the same place as SpaceX is.\n\nHmm, well, that's um that's a really interesting point. So I think SpaceX has stayed private for so long and they've been so in demand. Um, uh this is the hottest stock in the private markets. Everyone is vying to get access to SpaceX. Um and I think it's really sort of difficult, um when you've got that much interest and that many investors, um to sort of keep things quiet. So, you know, you see throughout the the the news that there's a lot of information that's out there\n\non what their performance looks like, right? So um it's no um so that sort of cat's out of the bag already.\n\nSo it wouldn't necessarily change the dynamic.\n\nYeah, I think so. And so you see like um what are the numbers, you know, um uh 13 last year, 15 this year. You start to think like the the growth is not parabolic um in uh uh their their growth is not parabolic. They but they are cash flow positive and they've been buying back shares, right? So I think what um this would do is really give them sort of uh a large cash infusion to go after some of their long-term missions to get to Mars, to um uh build data centers in orbit, uh to fund that and really have a big cash infusion to basically speed things up and go faster.\n\nUm and one of those is also what Starship is one of the projects that they're working on. Um so how important is that and what what's the timeline for something like that?\n\nSuper important. So Starship is a next generation massive vehicle. Um we've never had anything of this size. So if 2025 was the year of launch frequency, we were basically, we started launching, we launched almost every day, one launch per day, right? And that launch cadence is increasing. 2026 is going to be about mass. Um Starship is a massive vehicle. It is going to be fully reusable, which means that both the first stage of the rocket and the second stage both can land and be refueled and stacked and launched again. More like operational commercial airlines, which is really exciting because that is going to um it promises to deliver another step change in the order of magnitude, further reduction in launch cost, which really um will do a lot to again, to the halo effect, you know, comment to really stimulate growth in in this category. Um but at the same time, that vehicle is is necessary to launch these next generation Starlink satellites, the V3 satellites that they already um that they have already designed and they're just waiting for a vehicle that can carry them. Their data centers in orbit that they're now talking about in conjunction with this um potential IPO, uh requires Starship to be able to launch these things, right? So, this um is uh a lynchpin. It's it's critical to their strategy and it's also um critical um to to take the space economy to the next level.\n\nUm another thing that you're watching closely going into next year is what? geo intelligence and defense. Those are kind of some themes within space. So what should we be watching for there?\n\nYeah, I kind of just thinking about the convergence of AI and space in totality, right? So we talked a little bit about orbital data centers. Everyone seems to be talking about that now. Um Starship is and and Blue Origin's next generation vehicles too are going to allow us to launch new infrastructure that, you know, we couldn't do before like orbital data centers and some other things. So that's really interesting on the AI front. And also, um with regards to, you know, geospatial intelligence. So, um if GPS is the dot on the map, geospatial intelligence is the map. This is um uh digital information layered on top of the physical world. A lot of that comes from the global intelligence comes from satellites, um and different sensor types that are feeding into this really robust rich data set about what's going on on the surface of our planet. That's too much data for humans to comb through. So, um uh AI has come along at just the right time to basically help us parse through that and make sense of that, drive useful insights from that. And this is a huge area of growth. We're seeing um what what we call world models. So, everyone's familiar with LLMs and what's going on there, but those aren't really good at helping us to understand and navigate the physical world. So there's a lot of work going on right now um in geospatial embeddings, basically embedding the data to have the right geospatial information, coordinates, positioning data, rich layers of of data to basically help you now use AI to make sense of the physical world, right? Not just language. So, this is a huge area of opportunity. Um a lot of demand is being driven by defense and intelligence communities, but then also there's massive consumer and enterprise applications as well.\n\nVery cool.

The stock ended the trading session at 829.9 yuan, up 693%.\n\n\"It's another IPO tale in China that turns a crow into ‌a phoenix,\" said fund manager Yang Tingwu at Tongheng Investment.\n\nThe price surge \"creates huge arbitrage opportunities\" for pre-IPO investors, Yang said, and \"we're likely witnessing the stock's peak level for the next five years\".\n\nMakers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips are rushing to sell shares in China to capitalise on interest generated by a government drive to boost local production in competition with the U.S.\n\n\"AI and semiconductors are key areas of competition in the Sino-U.S. tech rivalry,\" Guotai Haitong Securities said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing. \"Against the backdrop of geopolitical tension, AI chipmaking has huge growth potential,\" as China seeks to achieve self-sufficiency.\n\nResearcher ⁠Frost & Sullivan forecast China AI chip sales to top $189 billion ‌by 2029 versus $54 billion in 2026.\n\nMetaX, which makes graphics processing units (GPUs), raised 4.2 billion yuan ($596 million) last week in a share sale that was more than 4,000 times oversubscribed by retail investors.\n\nThe IPO - China's sixth biggest so far this year, according to KPMG - priced the money-losing ‍startup at 50 times its 2024 sales. That compared with a multiple of 34 for Nvidia and 14 for AMD, MetaX said in a pre-listing statement.\n\nMetaX's debut catapulted the value of the five-year-old startup to more than 300 billion yuan ($42.58 billion) and boosted the wealth of founder and major shareholder Chen Weiliang, 49.\n\nAfter working for AMD Shanghai for 13 years, Chen founded MetaX with a mission to \"contribute to China's rejuvenation ​and national prosperity.\" The founding team also included Peng Li and Yang Jian, both former AMD engineers.\n\n\"The company is a leading GPU maker in China thanks to its AMD gene,\" ‌Li Hui, analyst at Huajin Securities, said in a report ahead of MetaX's listing.",

    "description": "Hidden deep under the floorboards of a small house, an excavation team uncovered four silver bracelets dating to the Viking Age, likely from the 9th century AD.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA farm in the mountains of Norway stands on the site of what was once a “large and powerful Viking farm” and has yielded a significant Viking treasure.\n\nHidden deep under the floorboards of a small house, an excavation team uncovered four silver bracelets dating to the Viking Age, likely from the 9th century AD.\n\nThe silver bracelets were found in what was likely the same place they were originally buried, offering more insight into to the origin story of the treasure.\n\nSilver was the Vikings’ treasure of choice. Their affinity for the metal gives discoveries of silver artifacts significant historical value—much like a treasure recently found in the mountains of Norway, one that had sat undisturbed since the 9th century AD.\n\nBefore farmer Tårn Sigve Schmidt was able to carve a new road for his tractor on his mountainous farm near Årdal, northwest of Oslo, he had to call in archaeologists to make sure there were no unique areas he was about to disturb. It’s a good thing he did.\n\nSeven inches beneath the floorboards of what was likely once a house for Viking slaves, a team of archaeologists found four heavy silver bracelets, all with different decorations, likely from over 1,100 years ago.\n\n“At first, I thought it was a question of some twisted copper wires that you can often find in agricultural land,” field archaeologist Ola Tengesdal Lygre said in a translated statement from the University of Stavanger, “but when I saw that there were several next to each other and that they were not copper at all, but silver, I realized that we had found something exciting.”\n\nFurther investigation showed that, at one point, a “large and powerful Viking farm” was located on the property, with multiple houses and shelter for animals. The location gave the owners control of the entry into the fjord. The excavation crew also found soapstone pots, rivets, knife blades, and whetstones for sharpening tools.\n\nBut nothing is quite as exciting as buried treasure.\n\n“This is definitely the biggest thing I have experienced in my career,” Volker Demuth, project manager at the Archaeological Museum at the University of Stavanger, said in a statement. “This is a unique find, because we very rarely find such objects exactly where they were placed. As a rule, such valuable objects are discovered on fields that have been plowed, where an object has been completely taken out of its original context. Since the silver hoard has not been moved, it can give us completely new insights into life and society in the Viking Age.”\n\nThe bracelets were transported within the block of soil they were found to the museum. X-rays were taken, and the team will test soil samples to help give a broader picture of the setting, including if the silver was wrapped in a cloth when it was buried. The bracelets are reminiscent of the necklaces found in Hjelmeland in 1769, and the archaeologists haven’t yet ruled out a connection between the two discoveries.\n\nExperts believe that the farm was the victim of arson at one point, likely coinciding with a period of unrest during the Viking Age in Norway, which stretched from from 800 AD to 1050 AD. The farm and the discovered silver were likely from the 9th century, archaeologists believe.\n\n“If people who lived on this farm had to flee from an attack,” Demuth said, “it would be natural to hide away the valuables you had before escaping to the mountains. And perhaps in a place where you would not have thought that a treasure was hidden.”\n\nThe research team hasn’t yet found anything \n\nWith no silver mines in Norway at the time of the stashing, any silver owned by the Vikings had to come from abroad, either through trade, as a gift, or even as loot from a raid. The Vikings traded in silver more than gold, likely a byproduct of the regions in which they traveled.\n\n“This is an absolutely fantastic find,” said Ole Madsen, the museum’s director, “which gives us completely unique knowledge about one of the most central eras in Norway, namely the Viking Age. We will exhibit this as soon as it is ready to be displayed.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance interest rates. The 30-year fixed rate is holding above 6%, with little movement. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are holding mostly steady for yet another week. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed rate is up one basis point to 6.09%. The 15-year fixed home loan rate is down six basis points to 5.52%. The stability of mortgage rates over the past several weeks is welcomed by borrowers looking to lock in a rate.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week, Dec. 15, 2025.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nLearn about how mortgage rates are determined.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various interest rates and loan amounts will affect your monthly payments. It also shows how the term length plays into things.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThere are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.\n\nA 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.\n\nThe main disadvantage of 30-year fixed mortgage rates is the mortgage interest, both in the short and long term.\n\nA 30-year fixed-term loan comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed-term loan. You’ll also pay much \n\nThe pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are essentially swapped with those of 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.\n\nHowever, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.\n\nDetermine whether to get a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage.\n\nAdjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.\n\nThe main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't reflect this, though — fixed rates are actually lower, according to Zillow data. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)\n\nWith an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.\n\nBut if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.\n\nRead about the differences between adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages.\n\nThe national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.09% right now, according to Zillow. But keep in mind that averages can vary depending on where you live. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be even higher.\n\nEconomists don't expect drastic mortgage rate drops before the end of 2026. Even with the most recent cut to the federal funds rate, mortgage rates continue to hover within a range — barely moving since mid-October. The Fed is currently signaling a single rate cut for 2026, with perhaps one more in 2027.\n\nRecently, mortgage rates have been hovering in a range — but there has been a general move lower over the past couple of months. According to Freddie Mac data, they remain about a half-point below where they were one year ago.\n\nIn many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.\n\nChase Home Loans is offering a \"refinancing rate sale\" for rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing. Learn how to qualify for this limited-time rate discount.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Learn what impacts these costs and how to lower or eliminate what you pay up front.\n\nRefinancing your home loan can help you pay off other debt, especially if you qualify for a cash-out refinance.

    "fullText": "Crypto markets were already on edge heading into President Donald Trump’s 9 PM EST primetime address to the nation from the White House.\n\nOnchain analysts spotted a large Ethereum move into Binance — the kind of transfer traders often associate with potential selling pressure, even when intentions are unclear.\n\nTrump said he would deliver “an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,” in a Truth Social post on Dec. 16.\n\nThe president did not specify a topic for the address, leaving markets to price in uncertainty ahead of the broadcast.\n\nFor crypto traders, high-profile political speeches can act like sudden volatility triggers, not necessarily because of direct crypto policy, but because they can shift expectations around the dollar, rates, risk appetite and market regulation.\n\nThat dynamic can lead some participants to cut leverage or reduce exposure ahead of time.\n\nOn Dec. 17, hours before Trump's 9 p.m. address to the nation, blockchain analytics account Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet “fully exited 10,169 $ETH ($29.7M)” and claimed:\n\n“Over the past 3 years, the whale has made a total profit of $11.36M trading $ETH.”\n\nThe post linked to Arkham Intelligence, where the address page shows a transfer of 10,169 ETH to a Binance deposit destination in recent activity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,014, up 1.8% in a day. Bitcoin was trading at $90,051, up 2.51% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLeaked memo shows popular crypto firm may wind down\n\nBitcoin, XRP slide as traders brace for key U.S. data\n\nAnalyst downgrades MicroStrategy amid higher dilution\n\nLarge holders - often called “crypto whales” - can influence liquidity and short-term price action simply by moving size, especially around major headline events.\n\nIn practice, traders tend to read whale deposits to exchanges as a potentially bearish signal (possible selling), while withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as more bullish (potential long-term holding).\n\nBut those signals can be noisy: whales also move funds for custody changes, collateral management, OTC settlement, or strategic rotation.\n\nWith Trump’s address set for 9 p.m. ET, traders will likely watch two things closely: whether more large wallets send crypto to exchanges in the hours before the speech, and whether derivatives markets show signs of rapid deleveraging.",

The record price for spot gold was trading at an intraday high of $4,380.99 an ounce Oct. 17, according to Kitco.com.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Dec. 11, the day I trekked out in the cold to get a few price quotes, the spot gold price was trading around $4,250 an ounce — up nearly 63% so far in 2025.\n\nOn Dec. 11, gold shot up to the highest point in more than a month, following the Federal Reserve's decision Dec. 10 to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. Traders expect lower interest rates ahead, which can be bullish for gold prices.\n\nYet if you're thinking about taking advantage of high gold prices to get rid of some gold, maybe a broken chain for a locket or even a gold ring from a loved one, you shouldn't expect to receive the same amount of money everywhere you go.\n\nWhat different jewelers and pawn shops offer to pay a seller for old gold jewelry can vary substantially — even as much as 50% in one example I found recently. Sometimes, the price difference is even higher.\n\nGold is volatile in price but viewed as a hedge against uncertain times — and we've had our share in 2025. Persistent inflation; three rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2025 after three rate cuts in 2024, which make some savings vehicles less attractive; a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar; global tensions relating to tariffs and wars.\n\nGold is commanding a higher price for many shoppers this holiday season, too, according to the annual PNC Christmas Price Index that reviews the cost of the gifts from the classic holiday carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas.\"\n\n\"Five gold rings saw the single-biggest price jump by far\" in that grouping of 12 categories, including a partridge in a pear tree. The price of the partridge remained unchanged at $20.18 for one bird, but the pear tree shot up in price by 14.3% to $400 in the past year, according to the index now in its 42nd year.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE Dec 17 - In a high-security Shenzhen laboratory, Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance, Reuters has learned.\n\nCompleted in early 2025 and now undergoing testing, the prototype fills nearly an entire factory floor. It was built by a team of former engineers from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML who reverse-engineered the company's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines or EUVs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\n\nEUV machines sit at the heart of a technological Cold War. They use beams of extreme ultraviolet light to etch circuits thousands of times thinner than a human hair onto silicon wafers, currently a capability monopolized by the West. The ​smaller the circuits, the more powerful the chips.\n\nChina's machine is operational and successfully generating extreme ultraviolet light, but has not yet produced working chips, the people said.\n\nIn April, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that China would need \"many, many years\" to develop such technology. But the existence of this prototype, reported by Reuters for the first time, suggests China may be years closer to achieving semiconductor independence than analysts anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, China still faces major ‌technical challenges, particularly in replicating the precision optical systems that Western suppliers produce.\n\nThe availability of parts from older ASML machines on secondary markets has allowed China to build a domestic prototype, with the government setting a goal of producing working chips on the prototype by 2028, according to the two people.\n\nBut those close to the project say a more realistic target is 2030, which is still years earlier than the decade that analysts believed it would take China to match the West on chips.\n\nChinese authorities did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a six-year government initiative to achieve ‌semiconductor self-sufficiency, one of President Xi Jinping's highest priorities. While China's semiconductor goals have been public, the Shenzhen EUV project has been conducted in secret, according to the people.\n\nThe project falls under the country's semiconductor strategy, which state media has identified as being run by Xi Jinping confidant Ding Xuexiang, who heads the Communist Party's Central Science and Technology Commission.",

    "fullText": "House Republicans on Wednesday approved a narrow package designed to lower health care costs for some Americans in the coming years – marking a win for leadership even as some of their own members complain it falls woefully short of tackling rising prices in 2026.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson and his team were aggressive in pushing their health care plan to the floor this week, vowing it will be the first step of a major GOP agenda on lowering costs next year.\n\nThey are specifically ignoring, however, the issue of the expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies that were passed during the pandemic to help people afford premium costs. Those tax credits will expire at the end of the month, spiking premiums for tens of millions of Americans next year.\n\nThe House GOP package, instead, would allow small businesses — as well as self-employed people — to band together across industries to buy coverage through association health plans in an effort to lower premiums. It would also, once again, provide federal funding for the cost-sharing subsidies that lower-income Obamacare enrollees receive to reduce their deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for care.\n\nHouse Republicans would also require pharmacy benefit managers, which act as middlemen between drugmakers and insurers or employers, to provide employers with data on the price of drugs, the rebates they receive from manufacturers and other operations.\n\nThe House voted 216-211 to send the measure to the Senate, which is not expected to vote on it before lawmakers leave town for the holiday recess.\n\nThe last-minute health care push from GOP leaders comes at a fraught moment for the party: President Donald Trump is striving to show he is making progress to lower costs for everyday Americans. But his own members are attacking Johnson and other GOP leaders for ignoring the looming Obamacare subsidies cliff, which would raise costs for tens of millions of Americans starting in January.\n\nIf the enhanced subsidies lapse, enrollees will see their annual premium payments increase by 114% — or about $1,000 — on average in 2026, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. Roughly 2 million more people are also expected to be uninsured next year if the subsidies end, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The more generous assistance was enacted in 2021 as part of a Biden administration Covid-19 relief package.\n\nA group of GOP centrists have been pressuring Johnson for months to reverse course on the subsidies — pushing bipartisan efforts to extend the subsidies while adding “guardrails” to ensure the dollars are not misused.\n\nBut Johnson has only dug in. Those centrists then decided Wednesday to openly defy Johnson and potentially issue him a humiliating defeat in January by signing onto a Democratic effort to extend the subsidies for three years. That plan from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is detested by most Republicans because it includes no reforms.\n\nBut centrists insist they had no other options to keep the money flowing in January – and prevent millions from losing coverage altogether – after party leaders repeatedly blocked their attempts to get a floor vote on the compromise proposals.",

The two ‍planes will be used for crew training and as a source of spare parts, officials said.\n\nSeveral published reports suggested the Air Force was buying the planes from Lufthansa, one of the ​few passenger airlines to have bought the 747-8 model, which was more popular ‌with cargo carriers before Boeing ended production in early 2023. A spokesperson for the German airline declined to comment.\n\nThe purchase is separate from two 747-8i aircraft that Boeing is currently modifying under the VC-25B program, which will serve as the next generation of Air Force One. The first of those heavily modified aircraft is expected to ⁠be delivered in mid-2028, the Air Force said.\n\nAn ​Air Force official, speaking on background, said the ​two training aircraft were also distinct from a 747-8i aircraft gifted to the United States by Qatar.\n\nThe Air Force One program has faced ‍delays and cost overruns ⁠since Boeing agreed to a $3.9 billion fixed-price contract in 2018 to deliver two modified 747-8s to replace the current fleet.\n\nThe Air Force said on Friday ⁠the delivery of the first of the two new Air Force One jets from Boeing had ‌been delayed by another year to mid-2028.",

Her father, John, revealed more evidence has been uncovered to help solve the case.\n\nSix-year-old JonBenet was killed inside her Boulder, Colorado home on Christmas in 1996. Her body was discovered seven hours after she was reported missing. Her cause of death was strangulation, along with head trauma.\n\nDuring an interview on NewsNation’s Banfield, John said there has been “new evidence” that may finally help solve this case. He said, “Chief Redfern told us, gosh, I don’t know, September, we had a meeting with him, and that he had submitted evidence for additional DNA testing. He didn’t say what the evidence was, but that it was submitted again, or perhaps new.”\n\nAlthough John wasn’t clear on whether the evidence is new or had been previously tested, he called the development “encouraging.” He added that the authorities “have advocated that if certain evidence that was taken from the crime scene has never been sampled, that it ought to be the main one being the [unintelligible] that was used to strangle my daughter.”\n\nJohn admitted he wasn’t told specifics about the evidence, but has more confidence in the current leadership. “It was not very good for 25, 26 years, and Chief Redfern from the outside, I’ve met with him three or four times,” he said. “I’m impressed with him. I think he’s sincere and honest, and so I’m encouraged, and you know, we’ve advocated.”\n\nHe will inquire about the evidence, including whether the DNA was tested in the latest format necessary to do IGG, investigative genealogy. “And that would be very encouraging to us if they’ve done that,” John said. “This new technology, it’s been around for three or four years, is really, truly an investigative tool that allows police to investigate and look for the killer. The CODIS federal database of DNA has been around for 30 years. It’s, frankly, a little obsolete, in my opinion.”\n\nJohn, who says he’s more optimistic than he’s been in a long time, will request a January meeting for updates.\n\nTELL US – WILL THE KILLER BE CAUGHT?\n\nThe post JonBenet Ramsey’s Father Confirms Bombshell ‘Evidence’ in Murder appeared first on Reality Tea.",

Police say the person in the photo was \"in proximity of the person of interest.\"\n\nAnyone who recognizes the person, or with information about the shooting, is urged to call the tip line at 401-272-3121.\n\nAs the manhunt for the gunman who took the lives of two students stretches into Wednesday, investigators say their highest priority is identifying a person of interest they’ve released numerous photos and videos of. Officials said during a Tuesday evening press conference that they believe this is the critical next step in charging someone in the shooting.\n\n“Once we identify who this person is, I believe we’ll be able to locate them,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said.\n\nGunfire erupted on the first floor of Brown’s Barus and Holley engineering and physics building around 4 p.m. on Dec. 13 during an economics class. The shooting left sophomore Ella Cook and first-year student Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov dead and nine other students injured.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, one of the injured students was in critical condition, five more were in critical but stable condition, and one was in stable condition, according to law enforcement and Brown University. Two have been released from Rhode Island Hospital.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have described the person of interest as being approximately 5-foot-8 inches tall with a “stocky build.” Photos and videos shared by police show what appears to be man dressed in dark clothing, including a beanie and face mask, walking down the street near Brown University approximately two hours before the shooting.\n\nOfficials have asked anyone associated with Brown or who lives or spends time around Providence to review the photos and videos of the person of interest. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the “identification, arrest and conviction of the individual.”\n\nProvidence Police Chief Col. Oscar L. Perez, Jr. advised the public to focus on the body movements of the person of interest shown in the videos during the press conference Tuesday evening.\n\n“You wanna focus on the body movements, the way the person moved their arms, the body posture, the way they carry their weight,” he said.\n\nInvestigators said they are hoping to receive more footage of the person of interest from the public, as they speculate that he may have walked around the area surrounding Brown University as much as a week prior to the shooting.\n\n“We also know in this profession that many criminals will pace out an area weeks and days prior,” Perez explained.\n\nPolice share map of Brown University shooting person of interest’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting investigation spills over into Massachusetts\n\nInvestigators release video timeline of person of interest in Brown campus shooting’s movements\n\nBrown University shooting victim remembered for having a heart ‘as large as the sun’\n\nPolice now trying to ID person ‘in proximity of’ Brown University shooting person of interest",

    "description": "Manhattan federal prosecutors have charged Tricolor execs Daniel Chu and David Goodgame of scheming to defraud banks and private credit lenders.",
    "fullText": "Founder Daniel Chu and the company's Chief Operating Officer David Goodgame, who were arrested and charged with bank fraud and wire fraud on Wednesday, planned to frighten at least one lender into a favorable deal, prosecutors allege. According to the indictment, the executives discussed telling a lender that the company might otherwise implode, much like the energy trading firm Enron in 2001, if a deal wasn't reached. This would be bad for the lender because it would put them at risk of losing everything.\n\n\"Enron obviously has a nice ring to it, right?\" Chu said when discussing with other Tricolor executives how to deal with one particular lender who had figured out the double-pledging issue.\n\n\"I mean, Enron, Enron raises the blood pressure of the lender when they see that. It, it has to, right?\" Chu said while laughing, documents show.\n\nIt's just one of several recorded conversations that emerged as part of a newly unsealed indictment against Chu and Goodgame. The indictment accused the men of orchestrating a years-long scheme to defraud banks and other private credit providers.\n\nChu is expected to be presented in a Florida court on Wednesday. Goodgame should be presented in a Texas court on Thursday. The men could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTricolor rocked the banking industry when it filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September, leaving lenders like JPMorgan, Fifth Third Bank, and Jefferies exposed.\n\nAt the time of the company's September 10 bankruptcy, its largest lenders were owed more than $900 million \"as a result of the fraudulent double-pledging and collateral manipulation schemes\" orchestrated by Chu and supported by Goodgame, the feds said.\n\nBut that didn't stop Chu from using company money to enrich himself, according to prosecutors. They said Chu directed another executive to pay him the final installments of a $15 million bonus as the company approached bankruptcy, resulting in two payments from Tricolor totaling $6.25 million. Chu then used some of this money to purchase a multimillion-dollar property in Beverly Hills, California — weeks before Tricolor filed for Chapter 7, the feds said.\n\nThe back-to-back bankruptcies of Tricolor and auto parts company First Brands have raised questions about the health of the credit market, prompting JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon to tell investors that he has his \"antenna\" up.\n\n\"When you see one cockroach, there's probably more,\" Dimon said on the bank's third-quarter earnings call with analysts.",

    "title": "My kids already lead privileged lives, so I refuse to go all out at Christmas",
    "description": "I already have a full-time job. I have no intention of taking on the unpaid role of Christmas Fairy in my house.",
    "fullText": "Here's what you won't find in my house at Christmastime: Elf on the Shelf. December goody and craft boxes for the kids. Brand new matching Christmas pajamas. Holiday photo shoots. Forced Christmas card writing. Expensive tickets to line up at a crowded shopping center to see an overrated Santa.\n\nBefore you write me off as a Christmas Grinch who needs a visit from three ghosts in the middle of the night to reinvigorate my festive mojo, hear me out.\n\nNot going all out at Christmas is intentional for two reasons. Firstly, I don't want to be that frazzled mom who stretches herself in 20 different directions trying to create a magical Christmas for everyone, decorating the perfect house, and buying every gift on everyone's wish list.\n\nI already have a full-time job, and I have no intention of taking on the unpaid role of Christmas Fairy.\n\nSecondly, my kids already lead highly privileged lives. The only time they have known hunger is when there's a long line at McDonald's. My 6-year-old son's extracurricular activities include French and fencing lessons — and no, he doesn't attend a fancy private school; they are just some of the many before- and after-school activity options we're lucky to have at our school.\n\nMeanwhile, his 3-year-old brother's daycare has a chef who cooks him a hot, gourmet lunch every day. That certainly beats my microwaved canned soup.\n\nRather than spending excessive money on material things, we prefer to enrich our lives through travel. This year alone, we've taken family trips to the Seychelles, Finland, Australia, and Tenerife.\n\nIt's safe to say, then, that my kids live with abundance. We don't need the extra pressure to push that even further this month, just because we're told we're bad parents if we don't.\n\nI don't want December to be something that we dread and feel we have to get through, because we have created so many tasks that end up draining our energy, rather than use this period to reset before the New Year hits.\n\nI know my fellow moms are experiencing this because I hear about it all the time. Recent stats show that here in the UK, where we live, 62 percent of moms say they find Christmas \"fairly stressful,\" compared with 44 percent of dads, and 45 percent of women without children. I don't want to be one of those.\n\nThe other day, I overheard some moms at school pickup complaining about how much they had to do before Christmas, and how they were worried about running out of time. I felt like interrupting them to say, \"But do you really need to do all of it? Who said you had to do it all?\"\n\nBut before I could do that, they both came to the very wise conclusion that their New Year's resolution would be to commit to doing less. Instead of feeling guilty for my Grinch-like mindset, I felt like clapping out loud at their realization that many of our supposed Christmas commitments are self-imposed, and the world won't end if we say \"no\" to more things.\n\nI have also spoken to other moms who are planning to prioritize what they find meaningful over what the typical Christmas movie might portray.\n\nOne friend is even doing away with the traditional roast turkey dinner with all the trimmings and instead putting together a grazing table of everyone's favorite foods.\n\nAs for us, we're also skipping the British tradition of the Christmas pantomime show this year. Many families look forward to a TV celebrity taking on the main part of a fairy godmother or an ugly sister in a campy fairy tale performed onstage. But with tickets for a family of four coming to several hundred dollars, it's hard to justify the expense each year.\n\nI want my kids to grow up feeling that their lives are already full, and that they don't need certain things just because other people have them, or social media and TV said they should have them.\n\nThat doesn't mean we're not embracing Christmas in our own way, focusing on people rather than following trends and holiday traditions that we didn't ask to inherit.\n\nMy oldest recently went with his class to a local nursing home to sing Christmas carols to the residents. I can only imagine how happy they must have felt to see 30 6- and 7-year-olds belting out \"Jingle Bell Rock.\" My son was proud of his efforts, as was I, knowing that he had secretly learned the lesson of purpose over presents.\n\nSo, no, I don't feel the need to manufacture what others may define as a magical Christmas.\n\nThis is what would be magical for me: Taking a break from relentless work deadlines, calls, and emails. Not having to leave the house at 8:30 a.m. to get to school. Having movie days in our pajamas. Taking walks in the windswept woods. Eating party food for lunch just because we can. Doing what we want, not what society tells us we should do.\n\nIt seems that our boys are already getting the message. For example, we asked them if they wanted to visit a shopping center in Santa, which can cost between $10 and $50, where we live. I was prepared to suck up for the sake of Christmas if they really needed the experience. They both shook their heads and said they'd already seen Santa drive down our actual street. What could top that?\n\nThis lesson seems to be translating into real life outside of Christmas as well. My oldest will turn 7 at the end of January, which is always a challenge to find the enthusiasm for after the holiday season. We offered to throw him a mini golf and pizza party just like the one he recently attended. His answer was that he'd prefer to just go out for a burger with a few of his best friends.\n\nWhen kids realize that more isn't necessarily better, it's a life lesson that's hard to believe they've learned — and I'm convinced that keeping it real at Christmas is the key to that.",

    "description": "The Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, is in full production after trainings, live-fire exercises, and upgrades.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has a new air defense system built to transform light vehicles into mobile weapons for shooting down drones and other aircraft.\n\nThe technology is intended to equip Marines with a new way to deal with drones and other aerial threats, the service announced this week. As the war in Ukraine has shown, the ability to counter these types of threats is critical in modern conflict.\n\nThe new Marine Air Defense Integration System, or MADIS, entered full-rate production earlier this fall after training and live-fire exercises. Placed on top of a pair of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, MADIS converts the vehicles into a single short-ranged ground-based air defense system.\n\nThe vehicles work together, with one focused on countering drones and the other geared toward helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. MADIS uses Stinger missiles and a 30mm cannon for those targets, and it also comes with radars and electronic warfare systems. Marines can also use MADIS while on the move, giving the service a mobile air defense option.\n\nIt's a capability boost over the service's Man-Portable Air Defense System, or MANPAD, which Marines would've had to equip themselves and leave vehicles to use. MADIS is also capable of being upgraded over time, depending on what types of threats Marines are facing and what weapons they need for specific missions.\n\nMADIS, developed by the Norwegian firm Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, has undergone several iterations since its initial prototype. The Marine Corps said its full-rate production version has sensors, algorithms, and mobility that allow Marines to locate, target, and destroy threats faster and better than before. Its first live-fire exercise took place during joint US-Philippine military training earlier this year.\n\nMarine Corps officials have said MADIS fills a gap in their air defense arsenal and is unique because it can complete the entire kill chain. Marines can use it to find and identify targets and then take them out rather than relying on several systems to do the same.\n\nMADIS also addresses Marine Corps concerns around how to defeat small uncrewed aerial systems in a potential future war.\n\nSince MADIS is mobile, it gives Marines a new way to defend forward-deployed forces — especially in a potential future fight against a sophisticated adversary like China.\n\nAs the Marine Corps reshapes its force for operations across the first island chain, from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines, it needs systems that can move quickly and deliver more firepower against a wide range of aerial threats.",

    "description": "An update on Oracle's data center plans was the latest development giving investors anxiety about the health of the AI trade on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Another day, another update that's giving investors anxiety about the AI trade.\n\nThe US tech sector was under pressure on Wednesday as traders took in a report from The Financial Times that said Blue Owl Capital wouldn't back a $10 billion data center the company was planning to build in Michigan for OpenAI.\n\nOracle shares led the broader market lower, falling as much as 6% Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed more than 1%.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly around 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday:\n\nHere were the other notable moves in the market:\n\nThe latest developments extend a broader rotation out of the market's most expensive tech stocks and into other parts of the market.\n\nThe enthusiasm for AI has dampened particularly in the past week, Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said on Wednesday.\n\n\"Additionally, rotation pressure out of tech has accelerated, with positioning data showing rising demand for smaller-cap and value stocks,\" Turnquist said of the latest market moves.\n\nThe FT's report said that talks between Oracle and Blue Owl Capital stalled over the planned data center. The private credit firm will not move forward with funding the project due to concerns about Oracle's hefty AI spending and growing debts, sources told the outlet.\n\nOracle disputed the contents of the FT report.\n\n\"The FT story is incorrect. Our development partner, Related Digital, selected the best equity partner from a competitive group of options, which in this instance was not Blue Owl. Final negotiations for their equity deal are moving forward on schedule and according to plan,\" Michael Egbert, a spokesperson for Oracle, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nIt's been a rough few months for the AI trade, but particularly for Oracle. After impressing investors with an aggressive revenue forecast, the stock has declined steadily in the last two months as the company stokes more concerns about the large amounts of debt coursing through the AI space. Shares are down 45% from their peak in early September.\n\nOracle recently triggered another sell-off in tech after reporting lower-than-expected earnings and pledging to increase its capital expenditures more than expected in the coming year.\n\nCoreWeave is the other prominent tech name to join Oracle recently as a poster child of investors' growing anxieties about the health of the AI trade. Similar to Oracle, CoreWeave has spooked investors with its high debt load and reliance on a handful of customers. As of Wednesday afternoon, the stock is down 66% from its post-IPO high reached in June.",

    "description": "Christmas celebrations at the White House date back to 1800, but Hanukkah wasn't acknowledged until much later.",
    "fullText": "The White House hasn't always marked the Festival of Lights with menorah lightings and musical performances.\n\nOfficial Christmas celebrations date back to the 1800s, but celebrating Hanukkah at the White House is a fairly recent development in US history.\n\nPresident John Adams hosted the first White House Christmas party in 1800, and President Calvin Coolidge held the first National Christmas Tree lighting in 1923. Jacqueline Kennedy began the tradition of choosing a theme for the White House Christmas decorations in 1961.\n\nStill, the first official White House Hanukkah reception wasn't held until 2001.\n\nTake a look at the fascinating history of how the White House Hanukkah party came to be.\n\nThe menorah lighting was held on the Ellipse, a lawn south of the White House.\n\nThe secretary of the interior under Carter initially refused to issue a permit for a menorah on the White House lawn, citing the First Amendment, The Washington Post reported. But Stu Eizenstat, one of Carter's advisors, argued that the National Christmas Tree's permit should also be denied on the same grounds, and the event was allowed to proceed.\n\nSince then, every US president has marked Hanukkah in one way or another.\n\nReagan maintained contact with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, leader of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement, throughout his presidency, even declaring his 80th birthday a National Day of Reflection, according to Chabad.org.\n\nBush invited children to light Hanukkah candles and play dreidel at the Old Executive Building, which sits adjacent to the White House.\n\nChildren from local schools and synagogues were welcomed into the Oval Office to light the menorah and play dreidel with Clinton.\n\nMaking the White House kitchen kosher involves Saran Wrap, tin foil, and vats of boiling water to cover and purify non-kosher surfaces. The chefs use only certified kosher ingredients.\n\nMatt Nosanchuk served as the White House's associate director of public engagement and liaison to the American Jewish community during Obama's second term. He told Business Insider that there used to be separate tables for kosher and non-kosher food at Bush's Hanukkah parties, but one year, the labels were accidentally switched.\n\nRabbi Levi Shemtov, a Chabad rabbi in Washington, DC, who worked closely with the White House staff to prepare kosher food, suggested making the entire reception kosher to avoid confusion in the future, Nosanchuk said.\n\n\"Apparently, President Bush said, 'Do whatever you need to do, it's fine,' and Rabbi Shemtov was like, 'Well, you're going to have to stay out of the kitchen for 24 hours before the party,'\" Nosanchuk said.\n\nThe Kol Zimra a cappella choir performed at a menorah lighting ceremony before the White House Hanukkah reception in 2004.\n\nThe two identical receptions were hosted on the same day, so that the White House kitchen only has to be made kosher once.\n\n\"Given how crowded the previous parties had become, they decided to have two,\" Nosanchuk said.\n\nIn 2013, then-10-year-old Asher Weintraub invented a \"menurkey,\" a menorah shaped like a turkey. He raised over $48,000 on Kickstarter to produce and sell them.\n\n\"Of course, I said we gotta invite this kid to the White House Hanukkah party,\" Nosanchuk said. \"We didn't use the menurkey onstage, but we made sure the kid was up front on the rope line so that he could say hello to President Obama and present him with a menurkey. And President Obama loved the menurkey.\"\n\nMike Boxer performed with the Jewish a cappella group Six13 at the White House Hanukkah reception in 2016. He told Business Insider the performers usually sing in the foyer outside the party for about an hour, welcoming guests as they enter, and then have a private audience with the president and first lady.\n\nBefore meeting the Obamas, Boxer and his group were told to prepare 45 seconds of a song to perform for them. They chose a snippet from \"A Hamilton Chanukah,\" a medley of songs from the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" rewritten with Hanukkah-themed lyrics.\n\nBoxer said that their private concert featured some unexpected guests.\n\n\"We look over, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor are peering through the door,\" he said. \"Barack Obama goes, 'Come in, come in.' One of them said, 'I love this stuff.'\"\n\nIn his public engagement role at the White House, Nosanchuk was responsible for the guest list of the Hanukkah reception. Every year, the list was built from scratch to include as many new people as possible.\n\n\"I went out of my way to invite people who had never been before, who had done interesting and important and valuable work in the Jewish community or in their broader community,\" he said. \"There were a wide array of constituencies and groups and individuals who we wanted to engage with and touch during these holiday receptions. The Hanukkah receptions were a subset of that larger group.\"\n\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter, is Jewish. She converted before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2017 that Trump broke with tradition by excluding Democratic lawmakers from the guest list of what had previously been a bipartisan event.\n\nThen-chief of staff to first lady Melania Trump, Stephanie Grisham, told Business Insider in a statement that masks would be required and provided at the events, hand-sanitizing stations would be set up, chefs would serve food from behind plexiglass barriers, and that the guest lists were \"smaller.\" She did not respond to Business Insider's questions about the exact number of invited guests.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that Trump attended only the evening Hanukkah reception, where he falsely claimed that with the help of \"certain very important people, if they have wisdom and if they have courage, we are going to win this election.\" Joe Biden had already been declared the winner the previous month.\n\nThree days after the party, vice chairman of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee Tom Mountain was hospitalized with COVID-19, which he attributed to his attendance at the event.\n\n\"Let's put it this way: When I went down to Washington, DC, for the White House Hanukkah event, I was perfectly fine,\" Mountain told NBC affiliate WJAR. \"And three days later after that event, I was in the hospital … ready to be put on a lifesaving ventilator.\"\n\n\"To think that today, I'm here before you as the first Jewish spouse of an American president or vice president celebrating Hanukkah, in the people's house, it's humbling, and it's not lost on me that I stand before you all on behalf of all the Jewish families and communities out there across our country,\" Emhoff said. \"I understand that, and I really appreciate it.\"\n\nThe Jewish Telegraphic Agency's Ron Kampeas reported that invitations to the in-person White House Hanukkah party on December 1 were sent out a week before the event, and that holiday plans took shape relatively last-minute due to COVID-19 concerns surrounding in-person events.\n\nLocated in the Cross Hall, the menorah was built by White House carpenters using leftover wood from a Truman-era White House renovation.\n\nIn addition to the regular White House Hanukkah gathering on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff hosted the first-ever Hanukkah party at the vice president's residence.\n\n\"As president of the United States, I will always support Jewish Americans,\" Trump said during the celebration, \"and I will always be a friend and a champion of the Jewish people.\"\n\nThe National Menorah is now a 30-foot-tall structure that requires a lift from a cherry picker to light.\n\nThis year's National Menorah Lighting, broadcast on C-SPAN, took place on December 14.",

    "description": "YouTube announced that it has secured the global rights to Hollywood's biggest night, a major victory in the fight over live events.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's biggest night is going to a streamer.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Wednesday that YouTube will hold the global rights to the Oscars from 2029 through 2033.\n\nWhile that means they'll no longer be on ABC starting in 2029, ending a more than 50-year run of consecutive broadcasts on the television network, the Oscars will continue to be available for free worldwide — just on YouTube and YouTube TV. As part of the partnership, red carpet coverage and other behind-the-scenes content from before the award show is also included.\n\nThe news comes as streamers like YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, and others, increasingly compete over live events to host on their respective platforms. Historically, the Oscars are one of the most-watched nights of TV, and in non-presidential election years, it is often the only non-sporting event to chart within the top 100 most-watched telecasts of the year.\n\n\"The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,\" YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. \"Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy.\"\n\nDisney and ABC will continue to hold the rights to the Oscars through 2028, including the milestone 100th Academy Awards.\n\nOutside of the Oscars, the Google Arts & Culture initiative will provide digital access to select Academy Museum exhibitions and programs, the academy said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement was also struck at a time when YouTube has evolved beyond a place people post and watch short clips and amateur videos on mobile and desktop to become a fixture in the living room. The monthly Nielsen Gauge shows YouTube grabbing the top spot in share of TV viewing among media companies for months running, with a 12.9% share in October, ahead of Disney (11.4%) and NBCUniversal (8.6%).\n\nThe nature of what people are watching has also changed. The streaming data analysis company Digital i found that videos lasting 30 minutes or more accounted for 73% of total viewing on YouTube in the US in October 2024, up 8% from a year earlier.\n\nYouTube has encouraged this shift, rolling out new tools for creators to incentivize them to make serialized shows that look like what you think of as traditional TV.\n\nYouTube's living room-domination plans loomed in the background of its recent highly public dispute with Disney over how much it should pay the media company to carry its channels like ESPN and ABC News on YouTube TV. Google recently shared numbers showing YouTube TV was the No. 4 pay-TV service in the US.\n\nTraditional media companies have tried to combat YouTube's expansion by taking a page from the platform and striking deals with YouTube video creators and podcasters.",

    "description": "At a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters, Musk discussed the company's future, its finances, and data centers in space.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk appears to be feeling upbeat about the future of his AI company.\n\nAt a companywide meeting at xAI's San Francisco headquarters last week, Musk told staff that if the company could survive the next two to three years, xAI would triumph over its competitors, several sources with knowledge of the meeting said.\n\nThe xAI CEO said that the company's ability to rapidly scale its power and data capacity would be a key ingredient in the race to achieve superintelligence — which surpasses human intelligence — and become the most powerful AI company.\n\nMusk said that xAI could achieve artificial general intelligence, which matches or exceeds human intelligence, in the next few years, even as soon as 2026, sources said.\n\nMusk said in November that xAI had a 10% likelihood of achieving AGI with its Grok 5 model, which he has said the company plans to release early next year.\n\nThe CEO also told staff that xAI would have an advantage over other AI companies because it would have access to around $20 billion to $30 billion in funding per year, and it could benefit from its proximity to his other companies, sources said. Tesla integrated Grok into its vehicles earlier this year.\n\nOverall, workers said Musk appeared happy with the company's progress. One insider described the meeting as \"peppy.\"\n\nMusk also theorized about building data centers in space and his plans to colonize Mars, the sources said. He said that Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot could eventually man such extraterrestrial data centers, the people said.\n\nMusk has previously said that Optimus could provide support for SpaceX missions as soon as next year. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have publicly talked about the possibility of building data centers in space, though Pichai acknowledged that it is a \"moonshot.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for a comment, the company responded with an automated message: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nOver the past year, xAI has rapidly expanded the footprint of its data centers, a project it has named Colossus. Earlier this year, the company said it had around 200,000 GPUs, and Musk has said it plans to expand to 1 million GPUs.\n\nxAI is one of many companies racing to build AGI and justify valuations worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Despite Musk's outsize profile, xAI is still a relatively new player in a race dominated by giants like OpenAI and Google.\n\nThe AI race shows no signs of slowing down. Earlier this month, OpenAI entered a state of emergency as it raced to push out its latest model, according to reports. Google released a new Gemini model in November, and xAI has pushed new versions of Grok in rapid succession.\n\nDuring the all-hands, xAI leads demonstrated several updates to existing products, such as Grok Voice, the company's app for Tesla owners, and its agents, sources said. Some of the updates included improvements to Grok's ability to predict outcomes, better listening functions for Grok voice, and video editing, the people said.\n\nDo you work at xAI or have a tip?

    "title": "The Oscars have a new stage on YouTube. The audience may have other plans.",
    "description": "Moving the Oscars from ABC to the internet is hugely symbolic. That doesn't mean that a huge audience will follow.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood may be embattled. But it's still capable of putting out a compelling narrative: On Wednesday morning, news broke that Netflix has won (for now) the right to buy Warner Bros. studio and HBO.\n\nA few hours later, news broke that YouTube is going to be the new host of the Oscars.\n\nEven the dullest of us can understand this storyline: In a single day, three of old media's most treasured assets have been acquired by digital usurpers — internet services that used to be dismissed by media giants, and are now giants themselves.\n\nIf Netflix does end up walking away with most of Warner Bros., that's a big, structural change. A purely digital outlet will control a movie studio that (still) puts movies into movie theaters, as well as the most prestigious premium TV service.\n\nAnd while I'm still processing this one, I think moving the Oscars from ABC — in 2029, when the five-year deal kicks in — is going to be more symbolic than tectonic. That is: If you are someone who liked watching the Oscars on ABC, you'll just watch it on YouTube.\n\nIt's possible that YouTube version of the Oscars could look and feel radically different. But I doubt it, because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences — the people who actually run the Oscars and produce the show — will still be running the Oscars and producing the show. And my hunch is YouTube has already promised the Academy that the 2029 Oscars will look and feel just like the 2026 Oscars.\n\nWhich brings us to the next question: Will moving the Oscars from a TV channel to an internet service bring any more eyeballs to the Oscars? Because right now, the Oscars seem like a product in permanent decline: In 1998, when \"Titanic\" was a megahit and most people treated the internet as a novelty, viewership peaked at 57 million US viewers. It has been steadily eroding since then, and now brings in less than half of that — which means Hollywood's biggest night brings in considerably fewer eyeballs than an average NFL game.\n\nEvery year, there is lots of hand-wringing and debate about why that's the case: Moviegoing itself is in decline; the awards often feature movies that people who do go to movies have never heard of; the show itself isn't nearly as interesting as it could be.\n\nBut there really shouldn't be any debate at all: TV is less popular because of the internet. So everything on TV — with the sole exception of the NFL — is less popular.\n\nSo while moving the Oscars from a broadcast TV network to the internet, and making the Oscars available worldwide, for free, will certainly increase the potential audience, I'm not sure that many more people will find it compelling.\n\nYes, it's cool to see stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet — the two leading contenders for the 2026 Best Actor award — sitting in the Dolby Theatre. But even if that happens, there's a very good chance that you won't have seen the movies they've been nominated for. So whether the show is on TV or an app, are you going to tune in — especially when you can already see Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet on Instagram and TikTok, 24/7?\n\nIf the Academy wants bigger audiences, YouTube is a fine place to look. They just might not like what they find.",

    "title": "The 6 biggest reveals from WBD's filing on why it rejected Paramount",
    "description": "A new filing says Paramount offered pay and a job to WBD CEO David Zaslav, and gives other takeaways from the bidding war.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery didn't just reject Paramount again on Wednesday. It also pulled back the curtain on what the bidding war was like behind the scenes.\n\nWBD advised shareholders to dismiss Paramount's $30-per-share offer for the company and stick with Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share (for only its studios and streaming business). In a filing, WBD's board called Paramount's latest bid inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on shareholders compared to Netflix's bid, which it said offered superior value and more certainty.\n\nSome of the information in the filing had already been made public, but it revealed some juicy bits that haven't been reported.\n\nHere are the top six takeaways:\n\nRight after WBD rejected one of multiple secret bids in September, David Ellison called Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to request that Zaslav meet with his father, Larry Ellison. The conventional wisdom was that the Oracle cofounder's billions would prevail. In the end, that didn't happen. WBD expressed concern that the bid relied on a revocable trust, whose assets or liabilities were subject to change.\n\nWe already knew Zaslav stood to make over $500 million from a Paramount deal, based mainly on his shares that would vest immediately after it closed ($567,712,631, to be exact, according to the filing). Zaslav told the WBD board that the Ellisons had \"indicated to him that\" if a deal went through, he would \"receive a compensation package worth several hundred million dollars,\" per the filing. Zaslav responded that it \"would be inappropriate to discuss any such arrangements at that time,\" he told the board.\n\nParamount also offered Zaslav the position of co-CEO and co-chairman of the combined company, a role Netflix didn't offer, the filing said.\n\nThat runs contrary to the narrative put forth in a letter Paramount's attorneys at Quinn Emanuel sent to WBD, stating they suspected the process was biased in favor of Netflix due to WBD leadership's expectations that there could be roles for them at the new company. Paramount's legal and financial advisors didn't know about the \"December 3 Quinn Emanuel\" letter and, in their view, the letter should not have been sent, was \"not helpful,\" and was a \"mistake,\" the filing says.\n\nThe filing revealed the presence of a fourth, previously unknown bidder in the process, \"Company C,\" which proposed acquiring WBD's cable channels and 20% of its streaming and studio businesses for $25 billion in cash.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Company C was Starz. Business Insider was unable to independently confirm that. Starz declined to comment.\n\nWBD determined that the Company C bid was \"not actionable\" and continued to work with Netflix, Paramount, and \"Company A\" (clearly Comcast).\n\nSome of Wall Street's marquee names — Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan, and Evercore — are set to make a total of $225 million in connection with WBD's sale to Netflix or Paramount, if a deal goes through, according to the filing.\n\nThe good times are poised to continue: Media and telecoms M&A deal value rose 61% in the past year, excluding the announced WBD sale, and the momentum should keep going in the years ahead, helped by investor appetite for valuable IP, according to PwC.\n\nThe Ellisons wanted to use $24 billion from Middle Eastern sources to fund their bid. That would seem to raise a whole host of concerns, not the least of which is that they'd be buying CNN and some of that money would come from Saudi Arabia's government, which US intelligence said killed a Washington Post journalist in 2018.\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka noted, however, that the issues WBD says the foreign money raised were \"presented as technical hurdles\" in the filing and \"not moral or patriotic dealbreakers.\"\n\nA big question around the dueling bids was which company would have a better chance of surviving regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBoth Paramount and Netflix made their cases, arguing that they'd sail through the process, while the other bidder would encounter issues.\n\nParamount said a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal would harm consumers and Hollywood talent. Netflix is by far the largest paid subscription streamer, and it would become even stronger with the addition of WBD's studio assets, including HBO and the well-stocked Warner Bros. library. Netflix, for its part, has argued that a combination of Paramount and WBD would actually be larger than its own proposed new entity, as measured by total US TV viewing time.\n\nNone of this seemed to be a chief concern for the WBD board, though.\n\n\"The WBD Board further took into account advice of WBD's regulatory advisors that regulatory risk was not a material differentiating factor between\" the Paramount and Netflix proposals, the filing said.\n\nThe wild card is Trump, though, who has close ties to the Ellisons but hasn't come down firmly on either side publicly.",

    "fullText": "Curious just how much time you're spending on LinkedIn?\n\nWell, now you can find out how many days out of the 365-day calendar year you're logging in — among other stats — from LinkedIn's \"Year in Review\" feature.\n\nMicrosoft-owned LinkedIn is one of many platforms following in Spotify's footsteps with a personalized end-of-year recap of users' data. This year, several companies joined in on the Spotify Wrapped fun, including YouTube and Uber Eats (shortly following an SNL spoof).\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago, I wrote a wish list of what other apps I wanted \"wrapped.\" LinkedIn was one of them.\n\nThank you for fulfilling my data-hungry dreams, Microsoft!\n\n(TikTok, Instagram, and dating apps, there's still time to deliver us with more wrapped experiences.)\n\n\"Year in Review gives members a new way to reflect on how they learned, connected, and grew in 2025,\" LinkedIn editor in chief Dan Roth said in a statement. \"It's a fun way to look back on the year and celebrate milestones like new jobs, skills, and moments of professional growth.\"\n\nOpen LinkedIn, and at the top of the homepage on the LinkedIn mobile app, you should see a pop-up inviting you to view your \"Year in Review.\"\n\nIf not, head over to your notifications tab, where there should be another reminder to \"look back at your 2025 on LinkedIn.\" Or search directly for the feature in the app's search bar.\n\nThe feature summarizes data points in several slides, including the year you joined LinkedIn, how frequently you use the platform, any job changes, and your LinkedIn engagement and performance metrics throughout the year.\n\nI do think the team missed a golden naming opportunity, however, to name the recap feature your \"LinkedIn Annual Performance Review.\"\n\nI'd also like to know who my top profile viewers were. C'mon, we know you can do it.\n\nI spent 281 days on LinkedIn, according to my own LinkedIn recap.\n\nThat's about 77% of the calendar year. And that definitely includes several weekends.\n\nThe feature also takes you down a memory lane of LinkedIn connections, reminding you of when you joined the professional networking platform and who your first connection was. (I joined in 2017, and my first connection was a peer from college.)\n\nMeanwhile, my connections are scoring hot jobs in AI. LinkedIn told me that 588 of my connections \"were on the move\" and landed at companies like OpenAI, Stealth Startup, and Stealth AI Startup. As a reporter covering tech, that's … not surprising given the heated talent wars happening in AI and the cacophony of new AI startups launching.\n\nIf you wanted an ego boost (or buzzkill), LinkedIn also recaps some of your engagement metrics, such as new followers, comments, reactions, and profile views (if you pay for LinkedIn Premium).\n\nPremium users also get to see their top searches and most-used premium features.\n\nThe cheekier features include a title summarizing what \"you embodied\" on LinkedIn. For me — and at least three other Business Insider peers of mine — it was a \"catalyst.\" This, according to LinkedIn, means that \"you put your ideas out there and got people talking, sparking fresh perspectives.\"\n\nLinkedInfluencer career, here I come.",

They include his wife, who has been divorcing him since 2021, and who wrote a letter to the judge extolling his devotion to three young grandchildren, who call him \"Pops.\"\n\n\"There is no allegation that Mr. Rubin engaged in any BDSM activity since 2019,\" his lawyers wrote in bail arguments filed Tuesday. \"He has been living in Connecticut for years, devoted to the care of his grandchildren,\" they wrote.\n\nFederal prosecutors countered that no amount of bail or electronic monitoring could guarantee Rubin's return to court; they also say that he has used threats and coercion to silence his accusers, allegations Rubin denies.\n\nRubin's former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, has been charged with pocketing millions of dollars to arrange the encounters; she has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges and is free on $850,000 bail.\n\nHer husband, Stephen Powers, is free on $250,000, according to court records. Both Powers have pleaded not guilty to bank and tax fraud in connection with the encounters.\n\nThree attorneys for Rubin did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nRubin is due back in court on January 15. If convicted of the top sex trafficking charge, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and as much as life in prison.",

    "description": "\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer told Business Insider. The deal would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, he said.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is the prospective tenant that withdrew funding from Fermi America's massive data-center project, sending the developer's stock plummeting earlier this month, Business Insider has learned.\n\nIn September, Fermi, which is developing an 11-gigawatt data-center campus in the Texas Panhandle, said it had agreed to a nonbinding letter of intent with an investment-grade tenant to anchor the project. The tenant would take the first gigawatt of power across 12 facilities.\n\nOn Friday, December 12, Fermi's stock plunged by nearly half after a securities filing said an unnamed prospective partner had canceled a $150 million advance to begin construction, known as an Advance in Aid of Construction Agreement, or AICA. The cancellation followed the end of an exclusivity period.\n\nAmazon is that tenant, Toby Neugebauer, Fermi's billionaire CEO, confirmed in a December 15 phone call with Business Insider, discussing the talks that led to the cancellation. The tech giant has been negotiating the deal, which would pay more than $20 billion over the next 20 years, Neugebauer said.\n\n\"The lead negotiator for Amazon called me on Thursday,\" Neugebauer said.\n\nNeugebauer said the talks between Fermi and the tenant remain constructive, and that the ending of the AICA didn't indicate any breakdown in conversation.\n\n\"It's just a normal negotiation,\" he said. \"Their issue was spending money after the exclusive period had ended.\"\n\nNeugebauer said he wasn't worried about the talks taking too long. \"It's a big deal,\" he said. \"Big deals take longer.\"\n\nLisa Levandowski, a spokesperson for Amazon, declined to comment.\n\nFermi America's Panhandle project ranks among the most ambitious attempts yet to meet the surging energy demands of the data centers fueling the AI boom. The company intends to bring 11 gigawatts of new power online over the next decade-plus with a mix of power from the grid, natural gas, and nuclear sources.\n\nThe company went public in September, pricing its shares at $21 to raise more than $680 million.\n\nDubbed Project Matador, the development relies on a 99-year ground lease with the Texas Tech University System. That agreement is dependent on a signed letter of intent between Fermi America and a tenant.\n\nThe December 12 filing said that none of the $150 million construction advance had been used and that the negotiations were ongoing. The letter of intent remains in force.\n\nAnalysts at Cantor Fitzgerald said in a note published December 12 that they had spoken to Fermi America's management and learned that, per the company, the anchor tenant \"tried to make last-minute changes to the agreement pricing that were unacceptable to\" Fermi.\n\nAmazon is the second company to be linked to the project. In October, Neugebauer told the Amarillo City Council that Palantir, the software company known for its police and government contracts, had taken an interest in the site.\n\n\"I just finished with Palantir, which is our nation's tip of the spear in the AI war,\" Neugebauer said during the October 28 meeting. \"They'll be here Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cantor Fitzgerald analysts said in their note that management indicated that they were \"active\" with two additional tenants, and in dialogue with another four.\n\nFermi America was founded less than a year ago by Neugebauer, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Perry's son Griffin. The IPO valued the company at nearly $14 billion.\n\nA recent slump in the company's shares has brought its valuation to below $6 billion.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "PayPal impersonators are at it again.",
    "fullText": "Another PayPal phishing scam is circulating, this time with email notifications about recurring or automatic payments. The messages originate from a legitimate PayPal address, allowing them to evade some security filters and leave recipients worried that their accounts have been compromised—perhaps just enough to ignore the obvious red flags and call or email scammers back.\n\nI personally have been targeted by this scam with at least five separate emails, though all have gone straight to my spam folder. Here's how scammers are exploiting PayPal settings to land in your inbox.\n\nIf you're targeted by this campaign, you may receive an email with the subject line \"Your automatic payment status has changed\" or \"Recurring Payment Reactivated.\" The layout imitates a real PayPal notification and includes a message about a high-dollar payment being \"successfully processed\" along with a customer service email and phone number to contact PayPal support.\n\nThe email is full of red flags: It is addressed to a random name (or, in one of the messages I received, \"Hello Update Invoice\"), has poor spelling and wonky formatting, and simply doesn't make sense. You can easily spot oddities like bold text and Unicode characters, which BleepingComputer notes is a trick used to bypass spam filters and keyword detection.\n\nWhere the trick lies is in the sender field, as the email comes from service[at]paypal[dot]com, a legitimate PayPal address, and paypal.com is in the signed-by field. As Malwarebytes Labs describes, this is likely an abuse of PayPal's subscription billing feature. If a merchant pauses a customer subscription, the user will receive an automatic email from PayPal notifying them that their payment is no longer active. Scammers are likely setting up fake subscriber accounts using Google Workspace mailing lists, so automatic emails being generated are sent to everyone on those lists. If you look at the \"To:\" field, you'll see that the message isn't actually addressed to your email.\n\nExploiting these types of loopholes to make phishing emails seem legit is a common tactic, and I've covered several similar PayPal phishing campaigns already this year. According to a statement provided to BleepingComputer, PayPal is working on mitigating this specific flaw.\n\nIf one of these PayPal messages lands in your inbox, don't engage with it. Scammers frequently use emails, texts, and calls about account security and financial transactions to scare you into action, and the impersonation of trusted institutions is often pretty convincing.\n\nIf you are concerned about activity on your PayPal account, go directly to the app or website and log in to view alerts and check transactions. Do not use contact information or click any links in the original notification, as this increases the chances of compromising your information or downloading malware to your device.",

    "title": "Apple Just Changed the Way You AirDrop With Strangers",
    "description": "AirDrop codes makes things a bit more secure and convenient.",
    "fullText": "AirDrop is one of Apple's best features. I use it on a daily basis to share files between my various Apple devices, but it really shines when I'm sharing stuff with other people, or vice versa. It can be tricky to find a quick solution to send larger files. Emails have too low a file size limit, chat apps can compress files, and cloud storage can fill up fast, but AirDrop is simple, built-in, and reliable. It even works with Android now, albeit just the Pixel 10.\n\nIf AirDrop has one flaw, it's that it's not particularly easy to use with strangers. Apple has changed how this side of AirDrop works over the years. For the longest time, you had two AirDrop settings: \"Contacts Only,\" which only lets your saved contacts find your device for AirDropping files, and \"Everyone,\" which leaves your AirDrop open to anyone with an iPhone to send you stuff. This was convenient when you needed to share files with strangers, but inconvenient if you left it on: Anyone with an iPhone could see your iPhone and send you anything—like, say, a bomb threat while on an airplane. Not good.\n\nThen, Apple changed this latter functionality to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" Ever since, if you want to open up your AirDrop to people outside your contacts, you have to manually enable this toggle, which will only stay open for, well, 10 minutes. After that, it switches back to \"Contacts Only.\" That's an improvement in security, but not in convenience. If you're ever in a situation where you need to AirDrop something to someone relatively frequently but you don't want to add their contact to your iPhone, you'll be switching back to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes\" every 10 minutes.\n\niOS 26.2, Apple's newest iPhone update at the time of this writing, introduces a solution—AirDrop codes. This feature forces anyone not saved in your contacts who wants to share something with you via AirDrop to ask for a one-time code first. Once you share that code, that user is temporarily saved on your iPhone for 30 days, allowing you to AirDrop repeatedly without issue. After those 30 days are up, the user leaves your iPhone, and you don't need to worry about pruning your Contacts app down the line. (This same functionality also applies to AirDrop on iPadOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2.)\n\nHere's how this new AirDrop experience works with strangers going forward. Let's say you're at a conference and you meet someone who wants to send you some relevant materials via AirDrop. You set your AirDrop settings to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes,\" they see your contact, and attempt to send you the file.\n\nOn your end, you see the request, with a \"Continue\" option: Once you tap it, you'll see the AirDrop code on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can tell the code to the sender, who can enter it on their device. If successful, the file will be shared like any other AirDrop interaction.\n\nAs stated above, this allows you to AirDrop with this contact for 30 days without needing to bother with another AirDrop code. But if you're done sharing with the stranger for good, you can remove their temporary contact early. Head to the Contacts app, hit the back button in the top left if applicable to head to Lists, then choose Other Known. Here, you'll see any temporary contacts generated from previous AirDrop sessions, which you can delete ahead of that 30 day deadline. Otherwise, your device will take care of it once that timeframe has elapsed.",

    "title": "Gemini 3 Flash Outperforms Gemini 3 Pro and GPT 5.2 In These Key Benchmarks",
    "description": "Small, yet mighty.",
    "fullText": "The AI wars continue to heat up. Just weeks after OpenAI declared a \"code red\" in its race against Google, the latter released its latest lightweight model: Gemini 3 Flash. This particular Flash is the latest in Google's Gemini 3 family, which started with Gemini 3 Pro, and Gemini 3 Deep Think. But while this latest model is meant to be a lighter, less expensive variant of the existing Gemini 3 models, Gemini 3 Flash is actually quite powerful in its own right. In fact, it beats out both Gemini 3 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5.2 models in some benchmarks.\n\nLightweight models are typically meant for more basic queries, for lower-budget requests, or to be run on lower-powered hardware. That means they're often faster than more powerful models that take longer to process, but can do more. According to Google, Gemini 3 Flash combines the best of both those worlds, producing a model with Gemini 3's \"Pro-grade reasoning,\" with \"Flash-level latency, efficiency, and cost.\" While that likely matters most to developers, general users should also notice the improvements, as Gemini 3 Flash is now the default for both Gemini (the chatbot) and AI Mode, Google's AI-powered search.\n\nYou can see these improvements in Google's reported benchmarking stats for Gemini 3 Flash. In Humanity's Last Exam, an academic reasoning benchmark that tests LLMs on 2,500 questions across over 100 subjects, Gemini 3 Flash scored 33.7% with no tools, and 43.5% with search and code execution. Compare that to Gemini 3 Pro's 37.5% and 45.8% scores, respectively, or OpenAI's GPT-5.2's scores of 34.5% and 45.5%. In MMMU-Pro, a benchmark that test a model's multimodal understanding and reasoning, Gemini 3 Flash got the top score (81.2%), compared to Gemini 3 Pro (81%) and GPT-5.2 (79.5). In fact, across the 21 benchmarking tests Google highlights in its announcement, Gemini 3 Flash has the top score in three: MMMU-Pro (tied with Gemini 3 Pro), Toolathlon, and MMMLU. Gemini 3 Pro still takes the number one spot on the most tests here (14), and GPT-5.2 topped eight tests, but Gemini 3 Flash is holding its own.\n\nGoogle notes that Gemini 3 Flash also outperforms both Gemini 3 Pro and the entire 2.5 series in the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, which tests the model's coding agent capabilities. Gemini 3 Flash scored a 78%, while Gemini 3 Pro scored 76.2%, Gemini 2.5 Flash scored 60.4%, and Gemini 2.5 Pro scored 59.6%. (Note that GPT-5.2 scored the best of the models Google mentions in this announcement.) It's a close race, especially when you consider this is a lightweight model scoring alongside these company's flagship models.\n\nThat might present an interesting dilemma for developers who pay to use AI models in their programs. Gemini 3 Flash costs $0.50 per every million input tokens (what you ask the model to do), and $3.00 per every million output tokens (the result the models returns from your prompt). Compare that to Gemini 3 Pro, which costs $2.00 per every million input tokens, and $12.00 per every million output tokens, or GPT-5.2's $3.00 and $15.00 costs, respectively. For what it's worth, it's not as cheap as Gemini 2.5 Flash ($0.30 and $2.50), or Grok 4.1 Fast for that matter ($0.20 and $0.50), but it does outperform these models in Google's reported benchmarks. Google notes that Gemini 3 Flash uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro, which will save on cost, while also being three times faster.\n\nIf you're someone who needs LLMs like Gemini 3 Flash to power your products, but you don't want to pay the higher costs associated with more powerful models, I could image this latest lightweight model looking appealing from a financial perspective.\n\nMost of us using AI aren't doing so as developers who need to worry about API pricing. The majority of Gemini users are likely experiencing the model through Google's consumer products, like Search, Workspace, and the Gemini app.\n\nStarting today, Gemini 3 Flash is the default model in the Gemini app. Google says it can handle many tasks \"in just a few seconds.\" That might include asking Gemini for tips on improving your golf swing based on a video of yourself, or uploading a speech on a given historical topic and requesting any facts you might have missed. You could also ask the bot to code you a functioning app from a series of thoughts.\n\nYou'll also experience Gemini 3 Flash in Google Search's AI Mode. Google says the new model is better at \"parsing the nuances of your question,\" and thinks through each part of your request. AI Mode tries to return a more complete search result by scanning hundreds of sites at once, and putting together a summary with sources for your answer. We'll have to see if Gemini 3 Flash improves on previous iterations of AI Mode.\n\nI'm someone who still doesn't find much use for generative AI products in their day-to-day lives, and I'm not entirely sure Gemini 3 Flash is going to change that for me. However, the balance of performance gains with the cost to process that power is interesting, and I'm particularly intrigued to see how OpenAI responds.\n\nGemini 3 Flash is available to all users starting today. In addition to general users in Gemini and AI Mode, developers will find it in the Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, and Google Antigravity, the company's new agentic development platform. Enterprise users can use it in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.",

While you can't see the full details of the operator skins, the silhouettes clearly hint at operators for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus in his power armor. Call of Duty's big IP collaborations also usually come packed with events for players to participate in. It's uncertain if the skins will be included in an event pass or as shop bundles for purchase.",

I grew up here, it couldn't be a better feeling and hopefully we progress to the final.\"",

Many of the cards are themed around a studio's particular games, but dressed up with holiday cheer.\n\nFor example, the holiday card from Crystal Dynamics shows Lara Croft capturing a dinosaur with Christmas lights. The Santa Monica Studio card shows Kratos and Atreus in a wintry setting. The Activision card depicts Black Ops 7's main characters in holiday sweaters wielding themed guns with a giant candy cane in the background.\n\nYou can scroll through the gallery to see all the holiday cards, and we'll update this post with any more we come across.\n\nWith 2025 wrapping up, you can also read up on the year's biggest gaming news and read why Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was our Game of the Year.",

Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",
