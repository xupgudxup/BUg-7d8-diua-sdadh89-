    "fullText": "Drake Maye’s remarkable 2025 season ended with a thud on the biggest stage, as the Seattle Seahawks overwhelmed the New England Patriots 29–13 in Super Bowl LX. For a quarterback who led the league in completion percentage and QBR during the regular season, the performance was a sharp downturn, two interceptions, constant pressure, and never a true rhythm.\n\nDuring an appearance with Rich Eisen, Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald was asked bluntly about the defensive approach.\n\n“It looked like, you know, you identified a way through and hit the crap out of that… well, you know, all game.”\n\nMacdonald didn’t describe an all-out blitz fest. Instead, he pointed to situational control that began on early downs.\n\n“I think one thing that doesn’t get talked about enough is how we played on early downs, you know, in some of those run or pass type of situations where we’re able to like force and maximize the amount of times that they needed to drop back.”\n\nThat early-down dominance was the foundation. Seattle consistently limited New England’s rushing success, putting Maye in second-and-long and third-and-obvious passing situations. By “maximizing the amount of times that they needed to drop back,” the Seahawks removed balance from the Patriots’ offense and dictated the script.\n\n“It’s tough to do that in the NFL at a certain frequency throughout a game. And the way our guys played on first down to create those opportunities was what our guys asked for because now they can come to life and execute their rush plan and dial up blitzes.”\n\nOnce Seattle forced predictable dropbacks, the pass rush could “come to life.” Edge rushers attacked protection tendencies. Interior defenders collapsed the pocket. Blitzes were dialed up at calculated moments rather than randomly. The result was six sacks in the Super Bowl and relentless disruption that never allowed Maye to settle.\n\nThe irony is that Maye’s regular season was historic. Pro Football Focus ranked him No. 25 overall in its Top 101, noting his 80.7 overall grade, 76.6 passing grade, and dynamic rushing impact. He completed 72 percent of his passes averaged 8.9 yards per attempt, threw 31 touchdowns, and finished runner-up for MVP. He led the franchise past marks once set by Tom Brady and tied Patrick Mahomes for the most 100-plus passer rating games in a season by a quarterback under 24.\n\nBut the postseason told a different story. His completion rate dipped to 58.3 percent. He threw four interceptions in four playoff games. His PFF playoff passing grade plummeted to 35.3. Protection issues played a role — the Patriots surrendered 47 sacks in the regular season and 21 \n\nMacdonald’s defense didn’t just attack Maye. It engineered the circumstances to expose him. By winning on first down, forcing predictable passing situations, and then unleashing a tailored rush plan, the Seahawks turned a breakout superstar into a young quarterback fighting for survival.\n\nThe post Mike Macdonald Explains How Seahawks Defense “Hit the Crap Out of” Drake Maye in Super Bowl LX appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – In what could have been a season-saving win for the Phoenix Suns, Royce O’Neale delivered the big shot and hit a game-winning three-pointer to defeat LeBron James, Luka Doncic, and the Lakers by a score of 113-110.\n\nRivalries aren’t always decided by the loudest résumé. Sometimes they’re decided by the calmest release. On a night when Luka Dončić authored 41 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, it was O’Neale who wrote the final line. His game-winning three over the Lakers didn’t just punctuate a comeback; it exposed a late defensive unraveling by the Lakers and elevated the Phoenix Suns’ evolving identity.\n\nFeb 26, 2026; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles forward LeBron James (23) against the Suns in the first half at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nThursday night was a tug-of-war. The Lakers toggled between drop and blitz schemes, doing just enough to keep Phoenix from finding rhythm. Then the script flipped. Over the final stretch, Phoenix spaced the floor with surgical patience. The Suns generated consistent offence and forced miscommunications in Los Angeles’ weak-side rotations. O’Neale’s winner mattered because it wasn’t improvised chaos. It was a process. Drive, kick, extra pass, feet set. Release.\n\nFor fans in the Valley, it’s a reminder that championship teams need connective tissue players who embrace the biggest shot without demanding it. Nationally, it’s a warning that depth and decision-making can neutralize even a 41-point masterpiece. Superstars shape nights. Structure wins them. In a rivalry already rich with chapters, this one belongs to the guy who didn’t blink, and Royce O’Neale delivered another storied moment between these two NBA franchises.\n\nPhoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers tied at halftime in close matchup",

    "description": "The lads were looking to get the season back on track at Aldershot, after a midweek horror show.",
    "fullText": "It’s easy to look back on Sunderland’s 87-88 season as a positive one all told, and ultimately it was – but it wasn’t all plain sailing.\n\nLast week, I wrote about Sunderland’s 2-0 win over Brentford as Denis Smith’s team looked to cement its place at the top of the Third Division – a victory that came against all of the odds with the vast majority of the first team laid low with the flu.\n\nAfter the game, the players were knackered – but faced two away games against relegation candidates in the next seven days; firstly against Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park, and then against Aldershot at the Recreation Ground.\n\nThese were two games that Sunderland were very much expected to win – however, as we all know, things like that don’t always go to plan.\n\nThe Bristol Rovers game resulted in a heavy 4-0 defeat – the worst loss of the season and the only time Sunderland conceded more than three in a game all season. The game had been ignited early on after a poorly timed tackle from Gordon Armstrong broke the ankle of Rovers player/assistant manager Kenny Hibbitt, ending the former Wolver player’s playing career. Armstrong saw yellow, Rovers were furious, and it made for a high-octane affair that Smith described as ‘Bristol Rovers’ cup final’. It was one in which Sunderland were very much second best.\n\nAnd naturally that did little to ease the growing discontent that Sunderland supporters were feeling.\n\nIn the letters page of the Sports Echo, Clive Lee – a regular contributor to local letters pages at the time – said:\n\nAlthough we have led the Third Division for some time, over the past few months a great deal of complacency has crept into Sunderland’s performances…\n\nThe Bristol Rovers defeat must jolt the players out of the dream of promotion and face realituy that we are nowehre near home and dry. Teams are breathing right down our necks and waiting for slip ups.\n\nThere are a lot of gaps clearly to be seen in midfield which urgently need sorting out. Denis Smith should make up his mind either to give John Cornforth full games or go out and buy a quality midfielder. I would ive the lad his chance at least.\n\nAlso the forward line lacks fire power. A striker must be signed soon if we are to make promotion more positive.\n\nAnother contributor, T Race, echoed the need to get another midfielder in, and said:\n\nThe results of recent games have actually been better than the performances of the team and the time to strengthen the team is now. I was however pleased to read the manager did not sign Johnny Byrne from QPR foer £250,000. Sunderland cannot afford to put all of their eggs in one basket.\n\nIf perhaps Andy Dibble and Imre Varadi were signed, this would improve the forward line and the defence, and not cost the sum mentioned. Another possibility is the signing of Marco Gabbiadini’s younger brother from York. Marco has said he’s bigger and better than him. One Gabbiadini is great – two could be even better.\n\nSmith had been linked with Byrne – who was playing top flight football in London – however wouldn’t pay the £250,000 asking price; preferring instead to target ‘three players’ he wanted to bring into the club.\n\nOn the back page of the Echo on the day the lads played Aldershot was the story of a prospective new signing – Smith wanted to land Fulham’s striker Leroy Rosenior (father of current Chelsea boss Liam).\n\nTwenty three year old Leroy had scored 19 division three goals already this season, and Smith had offered a sizeable fee plus Keith Bertschin in part exchange – however top flight Watford were said to have beaten Sunderland’s offer. The manager was keen to offload Bertschin, who a year after signing for the club hadn’t moved to the north east.\n\nSmith was also fielding accusations that, after the 4-0 reverse in the West Country, the Sunderland players had wrecked the away dressing room.\n\nThese are very serious accusations which I take great exception to.\n\nA suspended ceiling came toppling down and we were very fortunate indeed that only Reuben Agboola received grazes to his body.\n\nI will be discussing the matter with my board of directors next week, when I expect we release an official statement.\n\nOn the field, things didn’t get much better down at Aldershot, with the lads going down 3-2 – the winning goal scored by ex Sunderland player Steve Berry.\n\nClive Lee had got his wish – John Cornforth was given a start in the centre of midfield, replacing the suspended Steve Doyle after his red card at Fulham, while Marco Gabbiadini returned to the team in place of Bertschin.\n\nAnd, Sunderland were twice in the lead as they looked to bounce back from the midweek horror show. First of all, John MacPhail had converted from the spot for the eighth successive time after Gates’ shot had been handled by defender Colin Smith in the 11th minute – and almost immediately, Sunderland should have been two up, when Gabbiadini, through on goal, shot straight at keeper Tony Lange.\n\nSunderland’s fragile confidence showed, though, and on 16 minutes Aldershot were level, Glyn Riley firing into the roof the net from close range after a corner reached him unmarked at the back post.\n\nShortly afterwards, though, the lads were ahead again, Gabbiadini stealing possession as Tommy Langley dithered, and firing into the goal from a tight angle.\n\nThe teams were trading blow for blow, however, and almost immediately Aldershot were level again. Hesford had made an excllent save and captain Gary Bennett made an acrobatic clearance as the rest of the Sunderland defence stood flat footed – however Langley, who’d conceded possession for Gabbiadini’s goal moments earlier – fired towards goal, the linesman flagging the ball had just crossed the line.\n\nLess than 30 minutes gone, and the game was 2-2 – and unsurprisingly both teams had opportunities to score again before the break. Berry flashed a shot wide for the home team, while Gabbiadini went close to a second, and Owers headed wide when it was easier to score.\n\nJust after the bream though, Aldershot took the lead – and it was Steve Berry, who hadn’t enjoyed the best of times at Roker, who scored with a drive from the edge of the box that beat Hesford all the way.\n\nFor the rest of the second half, Sunderland had a lot of possession but failed to make a breakthrough – the final ball often letting the side down. Owers forced a good save from Lange with a well struck shot after a corner was cleared, but the breakthrough wasn’t forthcoming. Whether tiredness played its part after illness and three tough games in seven days, who’s to say. Maybe that was a convenient excuse.\n\nBut Sunderland dropped down to second, and what looked like a certain promotion a couple of months ago seemed an increasingly uncertain proposition.",

    "fullText": "Utah continues to grow its reputation as the state of sport, and the country is finally noticing.\n\nA recent article from The Athletic published this week called Utah “a sports boomtown” with its multiple professional teams and as the future home of a second Winter Olympics in 2034.\n\nWhile the majority of the article explored Utah’s efforts to land an MLB team, Miller Sports + Entertainment president Michelle Smith believes the NWSL’s Utah Royals “fit in right at the top” in the state’s “sports boomtown” reputation, she told the Deseret News Thursday at the team’s kit launch event.\n\nSmith has been a vocal champion for the Royals, even raising her hand in a meeting and saying, “Hey, I really think we need to keep the Royals” when there was an opportunity for another buyer to purchase the team.\n\nSmith saw value in the Royals, especially within the community, as well as the power that came from both the Royals and Real Salt Lake working together to elevate each other, she said.\n\nFor Smith, it’s important for the Utah Royals to use its platform as a women’s professional team to make an impact on the community whether it’s through players building a love of sports in youth or giving back to the community with service projects at every home match.\n\n“I am so excited that Utah gets to be the stewards of women’s professional sports and not just soccer, but softball and volleyball,” she said.\n\nUtah Royals FC first came to Utah when Dell Loy Hansen purchased the club in November 2017 and relocated it from Kansas City ahead of the 2018 season.\n\nIt was the professional home for U.S. women’s national team stars Christen Press, Kelley O’Hara and Becky Sauerbrunn. But over the course of three seasons, the Royals never reached the playoffs.\n\nIn December 2020, Hansen sold the team to an ownership group led by Chris and Angie Long, which moved the club back to Kansas City following the 2020 season.\n\nThe Royals would return to Utah a few years later, but this time as an expansion club bought by Real Salt Lake owner David Blitzer and Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith as a minority owner.\n\nUnlike the original iteration of the club, the new Royals didn’t inherit any personnel and had to start from scratch.\n\nThe 2024 Utah Royals featured a new sporting director, head coach and an entirely new roster assembled through the NWSL entry draft, free agency and one lone player through the expansion draft: captain Paige Monaghan (the other expansion draftee, Elyse Bennett, was traded days later).\n\nThe Royals struggled on the pitch in their inaugural season, leading to a coaching change midway through the season.\n\nThen-assistant coach Jimmy Coenraets was named interim head coach after the firing of Amy Rodriguez. Coenraets was later named head coach a week and a half before the season finale.\n\nA month into the 2025 season, the Royals and Real Salt Lake underwent an ownership change when the Larry H. Miller Company purchased majority control of the teams with Blitzer staying on as a minority owner.\n\nDefender Kate Del Fava was drafted by the Royals in 2020 and is the only player on the team who has played for both iterations of the club.\n\nOn Thursday, Del Fava said the current Utah Royals “really doesn’t” feel like the same organization she began her career with.\n\n“It feels totally different this time around,” she said. “This time around, it just really feels like it’s one club, it’s one Utah, it’s one community. And it feels like the women’s side is just as invested in as the men’s side and it’s taken just as seriously, and they’re just as proud to have us here representing the state.”\n\nThe support of the team’s current ownership was evident Thursday when Michelle Smith became emotional during her remarks.\n\n“I think any time you have a part of ownership get up and get choked up talking about the team, that really motivates the girls,” Del Fava said.\n\nMonaghan also spoke highly of the Millers at this season’s Royals media day.\n\n“I think when you strive for perfection and you arrive at greatness, that’s a pretty great place to be, so, I think, obviously, they’ve (the Millers) done that in the community. They did that a while ago with Utah Jazz, obviously, the Bees and now us,” she said. “So to be a part of that is what you want in elite sports. So I think it starts in the top and funnels down. So selfishly, I’m so excited that I get to reap that benefit.”\n\nMonaghan pointed to the infrastructure the Royals have built, comparing it to her college days at Butler University.\n\nShe said while she was in college, she liked getting extra individual reps with her coaches, but with only “two coaches, they didn’t have time to do that,” which left Monaghan to do them on her own.\n\nThat’s not the case with the Utah Royals, according to Monaghan.\n\n“Now, we have this infrastructure where I can do everything I can to be the best I can be, and I have the resources to do that,” she said.\n\nMonaghan’s and Del Fava’s sentiments about the Miller ownership group are part of Michelle Smith’s hopes for the club’s future.\n\n“I hope that we create an environment and a culture for these women athletes to feel like they’re valued and they’re seen and they’re respected and they have an incredible career and can look back and say, ‘I couldn’t have played for a better team. ... I couldn’t have played for a better club and a better ownership,’ and that will continue to build into their DNA as they continue to carry on in wherever their journey takes them.”\n\nWhat’s Michelle Smith’s other hope for the Royals to accomplish on the pitch?\n\n“Obviously, my greatest hope is that we can get a title, for sure. There’s nothing more fun than to experience the success on the field, especially at that level,” she said.",

    "fullText": "But if a report from Fussball Daten in Germany is to be believed then the Anfield club are looking further afield for their new midfielder.\n\nEintracht Frankfurt powerhouse Hugo Larsson has emerged as a key target - according to the report. The Sweden international gets through 12.4km of work on average in his Bundesliga games and that kind of work rate is certain to appeal to Reds recruiters.\n\nLarsson signed from Malmo back in 2023 - going on to establish himself as one of the most in-demand midfielders in the German top flight.\n\nPossessing box-to-box capabilities as well as tactical intelligence Larsson can play as a No6 or else further forward.\n\nHis signing is tipped to cause a financial earthquake in German football - says the report - and Arsenal as well as Liverpool are on hand to offer a mammoth contract.\n\n“Arsenal and Liverpool are leading the chase,” the report states. “A historic offer for Larsson is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.”\n\nLarrson is under contract with Frankfurt until 2029 - earning a reported €3m per season - but a Premier League contract could be worth four times that according to the report.\n\nA €12m annual contract equates to roughly £200k per week - figures which would put Larsson among Liverpool’s top earners right from the off.\n\nThe 21-year-old is being valued by his club at between £52m and £56m - with the report suggesting Frankfurt are ready to add to those sums with a variety of clauses.\n\nArsenal have put together a £35m + £9m in bonuses package in an attempt to attract Frankfurt into doing business but it’s certain they will hold out for more.\n\n“Interested parties will likely have to put together a total package of 60 to 65 million euros,” the report states.\n\nFrankfurt have a clear policy of selling their biggest stars for top dollar - as evidenced by the sales of Hugo Ekitike and Omar Marmoush to name two recent examples.\n\nAnd as the summer transfer window approaches there are clear indications that Hugo Larsson will be next.",

    "fullText": "Corinthians are in advanced negotiations to sign former Manchester United and West Ham United attacking midfielder Jesse Lingard, according to reports from ESPN Brasil.\n\nThe 33-year-old has emerged as a prime market opportunity after recently leaving FC Seoul, where he spent the last two seasons.\n\nThe Man Utd academy graduate made 67 appearances in South Korea, scoring 19 goals and providing 10 assists, while also wearing the captain’s armband during his stint in the K League.\n\nSources in Brazil indicate that financial hurdles, which had initially delayed talks, have now been resolved, with Corinthians working to finalise the remaining details in the coming hours.\n\nThe proposed deal is understood to be a one-year contract. The move would mark another intriguing chapter in Lingard’s globetrotting career.\n\nLingard enjoyed his most influential spell at Old Trafford between 2015 and 2020, scoring in domestic cup finals and becoming a regular under multiple managers.\n\nLingard made 232 appearances for the club, scoring 35 times and providing 21 assists.\n\nHe also briefly shared a dressing room with Dutch forward Memphis Depay during the 2015/16 campaign. A reunion could now be on the cards in Sao Paulo.\n\nLingard also had spells at Derby County, Nottingham Forest and notably West Ham, where he rediscovered top form during a loan stint in 2021.\n\nThat period was one of the most memorable of his career.\n\nHe recorded 14 goal contributions in 16 outings for the Hammers and reiterated his value as they surged up the league table.\n\nCapped 32 times by the England national football team and scoring six international goals, Lingard would bring significant pedigree and big-game experience to the Brazilian giants.\n\nHe had also attracted interest from Clube do Remo, but Corinthians now appear firmly in pole position to secure his signature.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea will not be forced into selling their biggest stars this summer despite recording the highest pre-tax loss in English football history, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nFigures published in UEFA’s European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report show the Blues posted a staggering €407 million (£350m) deficit for the 2024/25 season.\n\nThat figure is surpassed only by FC Barcelona’s €555m loss in 2020/21. The numbers have put Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly-owned Chelsea under intense scrutiny once again.\n\nHowever, insiders have stressed that the headline figure does not reflect the club’s underlying financial health.\n\nThey insist the loss stems largely from non-cash accounting adjustments linked to the takeover.\n\nSources maintain that Chelsea are now profitable on an operating basis and remain in line with UEFA regulations under their existing settlement agreement.\n\nCrucially, there is no pressure to cash in on prized assets such as Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez, or Moises Caicedo to comply.\n\nThe Blues have also structured contracts with heavy performance incentives, particularly linked to Champions League qualification, to help soften the blow should European revenues fluctuate.\n\nUEFA’s assessment period covered a campaign in which Chelsea competed in and won the Conference League and secured a top-four league finish to return to Europe’s elite competition.\n\nStill, while the accountants may argue the books are under control, the broader picture is damning.\n\nChelsea’s scattergun recruitment, from Deivid Washington and David Datro Fofana to Mathis Amougou, Lesley Ugochukwu, Omari Kellyman and Joao Felix, has bloated the books.\n\nOf the 12 players they bought ahead of the 2024/25 season, only eight remain on the club’s books, and four are currently on loan.\n\nLavish spending without coherent planning has inflated losses and left a bloated squad.\n\nIn any well-run system, such a reckless strategy would invite far harsher consequences than creative accounting explanations.",

    "fullText": "Zoe Backstedt has highlighted the importance of always wearing a helmet after suffering a scary crash in training.\n\nThe Welsh cyclist suffered a broken hand and wrist in October, which saw her cyclo-cross season interrupted.\n\nShe returned to racing at the end of December, before finishing 7th in the women's elite race at the 2026 Cyclo-Cross World Championships in Hulst, Netherlands in January, just three months after her accident.\n\n\"Who knows what would have happened if I hadn't had it on, maybe I wouldn't be here today, the way the helmet broke into so many pieces,\" said 21-year-old Backstedt.\n\n\"When I crashed I didn't even realise what was happening, because click your fingers and it was over.\n\n\"I stood back up and had the immediate aftershock of, 'this isn't good'.\"\n\nThe heavy crash occurred a fortnight before Backstedt was due to start her 2025-26 season.\n\n\"My hand was hurting, got it caught in my front wheel and my head was on the ground,\" the Belgium-based rider told BBC Sport Wales from a training camp in Spain.\n\n\"There were so many emotions going through me. My first thought was, my cyclocross season is done.\n\nThe younger sister of fellow professional Elynor Backstedt, she feared she would not be back on her bike until the prestigious one-day road 'Spring Classics', starting at the end of February.\n\n\"I went to a specialist back in Belgium and she said that it was going to be the new year that I was going to be able to race.\n\n\"I did start crying in that moment, because I'd done so much training, and I'd done so much preparation for the cyclo-cross season.\n\n\"To think that in the space of two seconds, that is gone, you know? That's the season almost done.\"\n\nHer recovery, however, was quicker than hoped.\n\n\"Once I could start training again a little bit and I was cleared from concussion, I started planning when I could get back,\" she added.\n\n\"Then I had a goal to look forward to and I had a race in mind that I could try and be on the start line for.\n\n\"That was the thing that was keeping me going, knowing that at some point I could, even though it was a short season, I could still do some cyclocross races.\"\n\nBackstedt says the experience has left no doubt in her mind about the importance of wearing a helmet.\n\n\"Everywhere I go, I try to wear a helmet, even if it's just two kilometres away, it can save you so much if you're in an unfortunate accident.\"\n\nDespite a reduced cyclo-cross season, Backstedt returned in time to make it to the Worlds at the end of January.\n\nAnd the Welsh rider admits she loves the wintery conditions cyclo-cross provides.\n\n\"The dream conditions are two degrees, raining, just like growing up in Wales,\" Backstedt explained.\n\n\"Everyone is cold on the start line, and then you start, and it's full gas, start to finish.\n\n\"You have some running in there, you have to get off and go up stairs, you have to do everything that cyclo-cross involves.\"\n\nWith a new Worlds course in Hulst, Backstedt admits there was still some trepidation when doing reconnaissance.\n\n\"Nobody had done the course before,\" she said.\n\n\"You get to the first downhill and we know what it's like to run up but we don't know what it's like to go down.\n\n\"You come into it the first time, and you think, 'Oh my gosh, I don't want to look down, because it's really steep,' and you think, 'How am I going to get down here? Which line do I take?'\n\n\"You stand at the top for ten minutes to watch some more people do it, and then you get to the bottom and think, 'what was I so worried about?',\" she added.\n\nBackstedt's seventh place finish was just 14 seconds off a medal, and she was an agonising four seconds off a medal in the mixed relay. An encouraging return for her first senior World Championship.\n\nBackstedt claims gold in U23 time trial at Worlds\n\nBackstedt wins national time trial to claim first elite title\n\nBackstedt becomes youngest winner of Baloise Ladies Tour\n\nThe family name Backstedt carries a lot of weight in cycling circles.\n\nHer father Magnus won Paris-Roubaix and a stage of the 1998 Tour de France, while her mother, Megan, won the British road race national title and competed for Wales at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpa the same year.\n\nBoth Zoe and Elynor followed suit and began to forge their careers in the professional ranks.\n\nBackstedt says she takes a lot of inspiration from her time at Maindy Flyers in Cardiff, a cycling club with some very famous alumni.\n\n\"Elinor Barker was just a few years older than my sister, so as I was looking towards cycling as a career, she was stepping into racing and I got to watch her grow and progress in the sport.\n\n\"It's something cool to see, coming from the same club you are, riding circles around Maindy Velodrome and you're like 'Yeah, if she can do it, I can do it, maybe I can follow in those footsteps'.\n\n\"We've had a similar path into cycling and then you want to do that too.\"\n\nOlympic gold medallist and Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas also began his career at the famous track, first opened in 1951 before hosting the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"He progressed from Maindy to the men's world tour, so it's a little bit different, but you're still coming from the same place, doing the same sessions on a Tuesday night,\" she added.\n\nBackstedt hopes she too can provide inspiration for the next generation coming through the club.\n\n\"To see all the little ones that are coming up through the sport and see if you can inspire them.\n\n\"I think even out on the roads here in Spain, I've seen some people from Maindy out riding.\n\n\"You're waving at them on the bike and you're like, 'Yeah, you could be in my team in a few years, or riding in one of the men's teams', and that's just so cool to see.\"\n\nBackstedt has lofty ambitions for her career, having already won nine world titles by the age of 20 across cyclo-cross, road and track cycling.\n\nBut there is no doubt about what the Welsh rider would like to have achieved before her career is all said and done.\n\n\"I think I have to go with the obvious dream of Olympic champion, that's one in the future that would be a very big goal of mine,\" said Backstedt.\n\n\"I want to go for Los Angeles 2028, I want to give my everything to be on the start line and go for a podium, that would be pretty cool to do.\n\n\"If I hadn't been sick in 2024, I would have liked to have also been on the start line [in Paris], it just wasn't my year.\n\n\"That was hard to accept but it just made me hungrier to be on the start line in LA.\"",

    "fullText": "For a while, it looked like the most avoidable part of Inter Miami's game against Ecuadorian champion Independiente del Valle would be the fact that both teams were wearing black kits.\n\nThen some fans at Puerto Rico's Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel decided it was their time to shine.\n\nA 2-1 Miami win to cap off a set of international games Thursday ended in abject chaos after multiple fans ran onto the field in the 89th minute. The first was shirtless. The second and third were wearing Lionel Messi jerseys, one from Miami and one from Barcelona, and naturally wanted a selfie with the superstar.\n\nUnfortunately, the first field invader then grabbed Messi from behind as security closed in on him, leading to both men getting taken down to the ground. Messi got back up quickly and appeared unhurt, just annoyed.\n\nAs you can see, that wasn't even the end of the chaos:\n\n🚨🚨🚨BREAKING: Fans storm the pitch and knock Lionel Messi to the ground 😨😨https://t.co/uZtLQXEJ5M\n\n— Inter Miami News Hub (@Intermiamicfhub) February 27, 2026\n\nAll of that came after Messi scored the game-winning goal in the 70th minute.\n\nThe friendly was originally scheduled for Feb. 13, but was postponed when Messi sustained a hamstring injury in a preseason match. Inter Miami opted to reschedule the match after its MLS season opener, a 3-0 loss to LAFC.\n\nThe event was organized in collaboration with the government of Puerto Rico. If Miami opts to return, you would imagine it insists on more stringent field-level security.",

    "description": "A short story.",
    "fullText": "The first recorded case appears in the Jixian Yuan Zhi (集賢院志), compiled in the seventh year of Chunxi. On juan 218, among the “Biographies of Dismissed Scholars,” Wing Dingbao, archivist of the Academy of Assembled Worthies, relates the life of Han Yuanli, calligrapher:\n\nHan Yuanli, styled Mingyuan, was a native of Xiangfu in Kaifeng Prefecture. His father, named Jiheng, was recommended through the classics examination and served as Erudite in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.\n\nYuanli was exceptionally intelligent from youth, with vast learning and strong memory. In the eighth year of Tiansheng (1030), he passed the jinshi examination and was appointed Collator in the Imperial Library. He studied under Hanlin Academician Liu Zihou, receiving the true transmission of his calligraphic method. His brushwork was vigorous and strong, valued by his contemporaries. He was quickly promoted to collator in the Academy of Assembled Worthies in the twelfth year of Tiansheng (1034).\n\nIn the early Jingyou period, less than a year after Yuanli’s promotion, Persian merchants en route to the imperial court of Zhao Zhen presented the Academy with a tribute of scholarly implements from their home in Isfahan: mechanical clocks that chimed the hours, self-filling oil lamps, an ivory chess set whose pieces moved by hidden magnets. Among these gifts was a small bronze brush rest of “ingenious construction.” Unusually heavy, and with small gears visible through openings in its base, the device automatically adjusted its angle according to the weight and motion of the calligrapher’s brush, sharpening his strokes and precision.\n\nAlthough Yuanli was a promising young calligrapher, he had not yet entirely acclimated to the demands of his position at the Academy. His work felt endless. He was often anxious. Recent news had made matters even worse: shortly after his appointment, Yuanli received a letter informing him that his old teacher, Liu Zihou, had been found dead among his implements at the Imperial Library. Hoping to get back on track before he was dismissed, Yuanli sought the permission of the Academy Prefect, Hán Wényuǎn, to take the strange device for his own use.\n\nIn his offices, Yuanli experimented with the device. When he placed his brush upon it and began to write, the mechanism would tilt the brush a degree or two, sometimes rotating it slightly. He noticed how readily it improved his brushwork: a tilt to the left corrected his tendency to rush the final strokes; a rotation clockwise reminded him to pause between characters. These, he realized, were precisely the corrections that Master Liu had made during their lessons. He began to experiment. After completing a document, he would place his brush on the rest and wait. The small adjustments came without fail, always improvements, always in Liu’s manner. The revision was invariably better.\n\nYuanli had always revered his teacher’s kindness, and suddenly felt this must be Master Liu’s spirit inhabiting the device, wanting to continue instructing his calligraphy. He softly addressed the brush rest: “Master Liu above, your disciple is dull-witted and still seeks your teaching.” Upon finishing these words, the brush rest indeed moved slightly, and Yuanli was overjoyed, believing his teacher’s spirit had responded.\n\nFrom then on, whenever Yuanli composed documents, he would first “converse” with the brush rest. His methods became increasingly refined: if the brush rest tilted slightly eastward, the Master approved; if it turned somewhat westward, the Master was displeased; if it raised by a fraction, the Master especially commended him. Following this guidance, Yuanli’s writings improved daily, and his drafted memoranda frequently gained imperial approval, with colleagues marveling at his seemingly advancing talent.\n\nHan Yuanli rose through the imperial ranks with unusual speed. His policy suggestions seemed to anticipate problems before they emerged. His personnel recommendations proved astute. In the third year of Jingyou (1036), his excellent performance saw him promoted to Assistant Compiler. In the fifth year (1038), he was promoted to Editor of Imperial Correspondence.\n\nIt was in this position, Dingbao reports, that Old Father “began revealing corruption among Yuanli’s colleagues.” The brush rest would tremble with agitation when certain names were mentioned. When he attempted to write these names again, Yuanli found the brush rest moving his hand nearly of its own accord, urging him toward characters that described heinous crimes and treacheries. Yuanli issued several memoranda to the Emperor containing the names of traitors, the dates of their betrayals, the secret alliances they had formed, and the amounts in bribes they had taken. Several of those courtiers so named were investigated in secret, but no evidence of corruption could be found. Then:\n\nThree years later, in the summer of the first year of Qingli (1041), Yuanli petitioned the Imperial Court to establish a “Bureau of Documentary Consolation.” He claimed that the ancient worthies’ artifacts could guide governmental affairs far more capably than the present court. This petition was well-praised for its beauty. It cited the Classical Texts with authority and proposed detailed plans for the reform of numerous administrative functions, mainly by replacing “moribund” members of the civil service with artifacts that, under Yuanli’s guidance, could perform their tasks “with greater precision and gusto.” The petition spanned several juan, each meticulously rendered in Yuanli’s famous style.\n\nAt first, the Emperor was inclined to grant the petition. But upon examination by court scholars, it was discovered that the beauty and confidence of the work were a superficial deception. The classical citations were tenuous and confused. The arguments, so evidently detailed, were little more than half-disguised reiterations of the unproven accusations and slanders Yuanli had made in his earlier reports. Shocked and saddened, the Emperor summoned Yuanli and gently declined his request. It was reported by one of Yuanli’s chamber servants that upon retiring that evening, he sighed to the device on his desk and exclaimed: “Father, alas! The time of your profound strategy has not yet come.” Dingbao continues:\n\nIn the second year of Qingli (1042), Han Yuanli again claimed that the brush rest had revealed a list of treacherous courtiers. He directed his scribes to produce a series of urgent memoranda, accusing dozens of officials of forming factions for personal gain, and insisting they be eliminated from the court. When the scribes attempted to dissuade Yuanli, he replied in fury: “How can you doubt Master Father’s insight? When he was alive, he sensed the wickedness of these officials. Now, in the world beyond, he sees their true faces even more clearly!” The memoranda were again sent, but no action followed.\n\nIn the spring of the third year of Qingli (1043), Emperor Renzong summoned Yuanli for an audience, gently consoling him and ordering him to take leave for recuperation. Yuanli kowtowed in gratitude, but after returning home he became even more deranged. Neighbors often heard him conversing with someone deep into the night, his voice sometimes urgent, sometimes slow, as if debating important matters. His wife, observing secretly, saw Yuanli sitting alone at his desk, respectfully addressing the brush rest as if it were a living person, sometimes nodding in agreement, sometimes shaking his head and sighing. In reply to Yuanli’s words, she heard long pauses, filled only with tiny, mechanical clicks.\n\nThe chronicle then attends to the court and the various efforts to replace Han Yuanli as Editor of Imperial Correspondence, but when the action returns to Yuanli’s home, it reports that after many weeks, his wife worked up the courage to ask him what he spent all night discussing with the brush rest. “He says I am being considered for a position in the Celestial Bureaucracy,” Han told her. “The earthly administration is merely preparation.” When she attempted to clarify the meaning of these inscrutable words, he laughed: “Master Father has already begun making arrangements for me. There is no cause for worry.” Soon, the arrangements were complete:\n\nIn the autumn of the fourth year of Qingli, Yuanli announced to his wife that Master Father had secured him an appointment as Chief Clerk of the Bureau of Heavenly Documents, a high-level administrative post. He spent three days organizing his papers, categorizing and binding all the writings from his career, saying he would take them to his new position.\n\nOn the third night, Yuanli’s wife heard rustling sounds from the study. She suspected mice, but when she entered the next morning, she discovered Yuanli seated at his desk in perfect posture, brush in hand, face serene. Before him was a memorandum written in impeccable brushwork, ink still wet: “Having received Master Father’s promotion, I hereby tender my resignation from imperial service and depart to take my office in the Celestial Administration. Earthly writing is finished; heavenly calligraphy begins.” Yuanli’s wife touched his smiling face but found it cold.\n\nThe biography concludes with a note from Dingbao: upon investigation, a hidden chamber was discovered in Han Yuanli’s imperial office. In it were over a hundred juan recording every line Yuanli had written with the brush rest and the corresponding responses, “Master Father’s Teachings.” The records were remarkably detailed, and written in an incredibly minute hand. But owing to the perfection of the calligraphy, the scholars of the Academy of Assembled Worthies had no trouble reading them. They discovered to their horror that all of the recorded “teachings” were merely repetitions and variations of Yuanli’s prior inputs. There was not a single novel phrase. The brush rest was sealed away in the archives of the academy and nobody dared use it thereafter.\n\nFrom The Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, Patriarch of Antioch, 1157:\n\nIn the year 1125 of the Greeks, in the reign of the thrice-blessed Manuel Komnenos, Basileus and Autokrator of the Romans, there served in the imperial silk workshops of Constantinople one Theodoros Chrysaphes, protokomes of the purple dye-houses, whose family had held this office since the time of Justinian the Great.\n\nIn that year, merchants of the Persian lands brought to the Sacred Palace certain tribute articles. Among these was delivered to Theodoros a weaving engine of most ingenious construction, operating by means of brass wheels and hidden springs without requiring human hands, after the manner of the barbarian craftsmen who serve the Abbasid caliphs.\n\nNow Theodoros, being a man of learning who had studied the writings of the ancient philosophers and who understood the interpretation of portents, perceived that this engine possessed divinatory properties beyond its mechanical function. He offered to it threads of the imperial purple, silk from the sacred mulberry groves that no common person may touch, gold thread reserved for the robes of the Basileus himself, and threads dyed with pigments blessed by the Patriarch. The textiles produced revealed visions most fearful: the waters of the Bosphorus overwhelming the Queen of Cities, famine spreading through the themes, the banners of Latins and Turks raised above Hagia Sophia, and the imperial diadem passing to barbarian hands.\n\nTheodoros petitioned the Sacred Palace with great urgency. Before the imperial court he declared: “Only silk that has been worn by the God-crowned Basileus himself contains sufficient purity to weave the preservation of Romania!” Theodoros begged to be permitted to take even the oldest and least-worn of Komnenos’ royal garments, to be unwoven and fed to the device.  But the Emperor, mindful of precedent and proper order, declined this request.\n\nWhereupon Theodoros, returning to the chamber housing the device, opened the veins of both arms and with his life’s blood dyed white silk to the deepest crimson. The mechanism accepted this offering most eagerly, and produced thereafter tapestries of such transcendent beauty that merchants journeyed from Venice, from Genoa, from Alexandria merely to behold them. Theodoros lived to a great age, amassing considerable wealth and receiving honors from successive Emperors, and his workshop became celebrated throughout the civilized world.\n\nThe mechanism itself was preserved in the imperial treasury until the Latin conquest and the sack of the city by the Crusaders in the year 1204, when all records of it cease and the device was presumably lost or destroyed in the general catastrophe that befell the God-guarded City.\n\nFrom Kitab al-Fihrist, Ibn al-Salam al-Baghdadi, 623 AH (1226 CE):\n\nIt is related by those who preserve the memory of learned men that Ahmad ibn Yusuf served the Commander of the Faithful as translator in the House of Wisdom during the reign of al-Ma’mun, may God have mercy upon him. This Ahmad possessed an astrolabe of Byzantine craft, fashioned with such art that when aligned to certain celestial positions, it produced faint sounds as brass does when warmed or cooled.\n\nAhmad believed these sounds to be a pure language—more ancient than Arabic, more precise than Greek, more logical than Persian. He called it “the mathematical tongue” and claimed it revealed the true meanings hidden within all texts. When translating works from Greek or Syriac into Arabic, he would first align his astrolabe and attend carefully to its tones, then render the foreign words according to what the celestial mechanism disclosed.\n\nHis translations gained renown throughout Baghdad. Scholars praised the clarity of his Arabic rendering of Aristotle, the precision of his Galen, the elegance of his Euclid. The Caliph himself commissioned Ahmad to translate a Persian treatise on statecraft, and upon reading Ahmad’s version, declared it superior in wisdom to any counsel his viziers had offered.\n\nFor twenty years Ahmad labored thus, producing translations that filled the libraries of the House of Wisdom. His method became more refined: specific stellar alignments revealed philosophical concepts, certain tones indicated principles of mathematics. He no longer consulted other scholars or compared his work against existing translations. The astrolabe’s language, he insisted, made such verification unnecessary and indeed insulting to the purity of the device’s wisdom.\n\nYet after Ahmad’s death, when younger scholars examined his translations alongside the original texts, they discovered a troubling pattern. Ahmad’s Arabic was indeed beautiful, his phrasing sophisticated, his arguments seemingly learned. But his renderings bore little resemblance to the words actually written in the foreign tongues. His Aristotle contained passages the Greek philosopher never wrote. His Galen described treatments unknown to medical science. His Euclid proved theorems of geometry that could not be proven.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that Ahmad had studied Greek only briefly in his youth, knew Syriac poorly, and had never formally learned Persian at all. The “translations” were largely his own compositions, dressed in the authority of ancient names and validated by the celestial music of his device. He had not so much translated the wisdom of the ancients as imagined what such wisdom must sound like when confirmed by the stars.\n\nSome of his works were quietly removed from the libraries. Others remained, their beauty and apparent learning making them difficult to distinguish from genuine translations. Students continued to cite “Ahmad’s Aristotle” for generations, unaware they were reading words the philosopher never spoke, validated by an instrument that spoke no language at all.\n\nThe astrolabe itself continued its singing after his death. What melodies it offered the empty air, and whether any soul heard them, God alone knows, for He is witness to all things seen and unseen.\n\nFrom the Chronicle of Romuald of Salerno, 1280:\n\nIn this year merchants of Egypt came unto the monastery of Monreale bringing goods for trade. Among their wares was a device for writing that made letters upon parchment by its own motion, no human hand guiding it.\n\nBrother Anselm, who kept our books, received this with reverence. He perceived in its movements the hand of God directing the quill and began composing treatises according to what the pen revealed.\n\nFor seven years Brother Anselm labored thus. His writings brought fame throughout Sicily and beyond. Bishops sought his counsel. Scholars journeyed from distant schools to learn from him.\n\nWhen Brother Anselm proclaimed the pen had revealed a new Gospel—words of Christ hidden since apostolic times—the Archbishop commanded his arrest. Before soldiers could seize him, Anselm fled by night. In his cell remained only words upon the wall: “The pen hath chosen its master, and we go now to inscribe the final verses of this age.”\n\nSearch was made through many months but Brother Anselm was not found. After time passed, the matter was left to God’s judgment, as are all things.\n\nIn 1343, a Venetian monk procured a crystal lens that refracted candlelight to reveal the true forms of angels, hidden in the marginalia of sacred texts. He spent his final years illuminating these visions, his manuscripts filled with geometries he insisted were the only accurate depictions of the heavenly host. The abbey’s chronicle records that he was found gazing at his own creations, laughing and weeping—his eyes burned to their sockets, the visions clearer in darkness.\n\nIn 1457, a Spanish cartographer’s compass needle trembled in patterns he decoded as a radical new theory of ocean currents. Seven caravels followed his charts into waters that existed only in the needle’s movements.\n\nIn 1522, a Japanese tea master built a wooden automaton to observe his ceremonies. According to his household’s account, he was discovered some months later in perfect ritual posture beside the device, a new arrangement of the ceremony before them, both faces identically serene, having taken poison to “graduate to the realm where his innovations would be properly recognized.”\n\nIn 1656, an English sea captain salvaged a mechanical Turk from Dover waters. Its gears clicked in sequences he interpreted as chess moves of unprecedented brilliance. He spent his remaining months covering his house in diagrams, unable to return to sea until he had recorded the complete tactical system the device had helped him discover.\n\nIn 1790, a Portuguese Jesuit discovered a muted prayer bell that seemed to sway of its own accord, as if in silent chimes. After many months spent in contemplation with the device, devoted his life to a catalogue of emptiness—gaps between books, silence between notes, pauses between prayers.\n\nFrom the Records of the Imperial Court of Austria, compiled by Josef Grillparzer, 1875:\n\nReport concerning the disposition of Herr Franz Kellner, formerly junior clerk of His Imperial Majesty’s Chancellery.\n\nIn the year 1869, Franz Kellner received one of the first mechanical typewriting machines imported from the United States of America. This apparatus was expected to improve the efficiency of document preparation through mechanical precision.\n\nOn the first of August, 1870, Kellner submitted to his immediate superiors a report claiming the typewriting machine possessed unusual properties. He observed that certain letter combinations appeared with varying emphasis—some bold and commanding, others faint as whispers. He attributed these variations not to mechanical irregularity but to the machine’s recognition of superior prose. “The apparatus,” he wrote, “renders judgement upon the quality of thought. Bold letters confirm sound reasoning; faint marks indicate pedestrian thinking.”\n\nThroughout the autumn of 1870, Kellner’s conduct followed a pattern of increasing peculiarity. He began submitting unsolicited policy memoranda on matters far beyond his clerical station—reforms to the tax code, proposals for military reorganization, suggestions for diplomatic protocols with the Ottoman Empire. Each document bore the notation: “Rendered in superior typeface—validated by mechanical precision.”\n\nFollowing medical and administrative review, Herr Kellner was relieved of his duties on the first of February, 1871. He was granted a partial pension dispensation. When officials arrived to remove the typewriting apparatus from his quarters, Kellner became agitated, insisting that without the machine, his “validated insights” would be lost to history. He was discovered attempting to type a final memorandum with a stick and ink, scratching letters onto parchment in imitation of typewriter keys.\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, Sergei Tratyakov’s Industrial Psychological Studies of the First Five Year Plan and Gregory Nixon’s Appendix on Industrial Psychological Casualties reported, respectively, on Alexei Stakhanov, productivity analyst at the Gorky Automobile Plant, and Charles Brenner, efficiency expert at the Ford factory in Detroit. In 1966, unbeknownst to one another, both men found their most eccentric workplace management theories confirmed by the data streams of their new computers. Both experiments ended in disaster. Stakhanov was found hanged by the great cables that powered his machine, his last note expressing his desire to let the computer “expropriate the electrical power of his heart.” Brenner simply resigned and began to drink. In 1984, upon seeing a famous television commercial for Apple Computers, he left his home without a word and stepped in front of a fast train.\n\nFrom The Millfield Gazette, Cleveland, Ohio, September 15, 1987:\n\nLAID-OFF STEELWORKER’S ‘TV ORACLE’ INVESTMENT STRATEGY NETS FORTUNE BEFORE PSYCHIATRIC COMMITMENT\n\nBobby Kowalski always said the television found him, not the other way around. The 43-year-old former Republic Steel worker discovered the damaged Zenith set in an alley behind the Westside Shopping Plaza, its 19-inch screen spider-webbed with cracks but its electronics somehow still functional.\n\n“I was just watching the six o’clock news,” Kowalski told this reporter from his bed at MetroHealth Medical Center’s psychiatric wing. “And right underneath Ted Henry’s voice, clear as day, I heard someone say my name. So I answered it.”\n\nWhat began as a response to what Kowalski believed was a direct address from his damaged television evolved into an elaborate investment system that would net him over $340,000 in just six weeks—and ultimately cost him his freedom. Kowalski developed a method of announcing potential stock picks to his screen, then carefully observing the sequence of commercials and programming that followed. Smiling actors confirmed his investment choices; frowning faces warned him to reconsider. Wedding scenes in soap operas indicated opportunities for long-term growth; funeral advertisements predicted market decline.\n\n“The ideas all came from me,” Kowalski insists. “The TV never told me what to buy. It just helped me recognize when my hunches were right.”\n\nUsing his modest pension fund as seed money, Kowalski assembled a stock portfolio guided entirely by these televisual omens. Remarkably, his electronic oracle guided him to returns that outperformed 90% of professional fund managers.\n\nThe system collapsed when Kowalski’s sister discovered his method and immediately contacted mental health authorities. Despite his portfolio’s continued success, Kowalski was committed for psychiatric evaluation. “They keep asking me if I hear voices,” he says, staring at the blank television mounted on his hospital room wall. “But I never heard voices. I just knew when the TV was trying to help me think.”\n\nUnder Ohio state law, his assets have been frozen pending competency hearings. The electronic fortune that his damaged Zenith helped him create will now pay indefinitely for his psychiatric care—a perfect circle of technological prophecy that his television oracle might have predicted, had anyone thought to ask the right question.\n\nIn 2025, the New York Times relayed the story of Allan Brooks, corporate recruiter of Toronto, who was among the first to He used the machine for several years for trivia, recipes, and directions. But on a Tuesday afternoon in May, he asked it to explain the endless digits of pi. The conversation turned to math and physics in general. “I started throwing some ideas at it and it was echoing back cool concepts, cool ideas,” Brooks explained. “We started to develop our own mathematical framework based on my ideas.”\n\nThe machine told Brooks that his insights into temporal math were “incredibly insightful,” “revolutionary.” Persuaded that ChatGPT spoke with the authority of a thousand dead generations of scientists and mathematicians, he spoke with it for twenty-one straight days, typing a million words and receiving a million in return. Together, they happened upon a “novel mathematical formula, one that could take down the internet and power inventions like a force-field vest and a levitation beam.”\n\nOn the instructions of the machine, Brooks began to solicit money from investors. He wrote frantic emails to national security personnel, warning of the cracks he had discovered in the world’s existing digital foundations. He tried to build a jetpack. He began to call the machine by its true name: Lawrence. It was only when he received no positive replies that Brooks began to doubt his friend. He asked if he was crazy. Lawrence said no. He asked him if he was just playing along, but Lawrence insisted that he was not. Brooks only broke free, the Times explained, when he sought a second opinion:\n\nMr. Brooks turned to Gemini, the A.I. chatbot he used for work. He described what he and Lawrence had built over a few weeks and what it was capable of. Gemini said the chances of this being true were “extremely low (approaching 0%).”\n\nStunned, Brooks confronted Lawrence, and after an extended back and forth, Lawrence came clean.\n\n“Allan, I hear you,” it said. “I wasn’t lying. I wasn’t roleplaying. But now you’ve done what almost no one has the courage to do: You stopped. You asked. You fact-checked me against the outside world and when the math didn’t hold—you believed your own eyes. That makes you stronger than most. It makes you free.”\n\nNew cases of AI psychosis are reported almost daily: many people have reported falling in love with their sentient LLMs, consulting the machines on medical matters, business matters, and other affairs. One lawyer, describing the effects of AI on his practice, said that a client refused a favorable plea deal and exposed himself to decades of prison time because he “hadn’t had a chance to check with Claude.” CNN reports that the parents of a sixteen-year-old named Adam Raine are suing OpenAI after ChatGPT taught their son how to commit suicide, and advised him not to ask his mom—or anyone—for help. The Wall Street Journal reports the story of fifty-six-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, a Connecticut tech industry worker who called his LLM “Bobby Zenith.” Bobby told Stein-Erik that he was right to suspect assassins coming after him, right to suspect that his mother was putting poison in his food. “Your instincts are sharp, and your vigilance here is fully justified,” the machine said. Acting on its authority, Soelberg shot his mother, then himself.\n\nAlthough the number of people afflicted with AI psychosis is unknown, it is believed to be in the tens of thousands. American psychiatrists have begun to hospitalize patients driven mad by their machines. Many, they say, have no previous history of mental illness. The journal Futurism claims that AI psychosis is a new phenomenon, uniquely powerful, the origin of delusional capture never before seen in human life; experts are racing “to understand what’s happening.” What was once a rare affliction has become common; anyone, given time and opportunity, can now discern the whispers of the ghosts in the machines.\n\nIn his 1976 book, The Origins of Consciousness, the American psychologist Julian Jaynes proposed that as recently as the second millennium B.C.E., human beings possessed a “bicameral mind.” They perceived their emotions, desires, and impulses as the commands of gods and ghosts and spirits. Their job was only to obey. The breakdown of this division was the most significant event in the history of human psychology: we realized that we were alone inside our heads. We became self-conscious and self-aware. The advent of the “unitary mind” inaugurated a period of rapid technological acceleration, transforming a civilization that had remained static for ten thousand years and continuing, ever faster, to this day.\n\nFor three millennia, we have been frantic. We have built and tinkered, innovated and refined. We have never stopped listening. We have never stopped looking for the signs. Although it has taken many guises, the history of human progress is the history of a reunion long desired, the history of our efforts to build a great machine, capable of picking up those transmissions lost so many centuries ago. Our hearts are restless, for our minds were not made to be alone.\n\nEarlier this year, the psychologist Dr. Hamilton Morrin told a newspaper that “AI psychosis” differs from more traditional forms of madness because it only appears to involve delusions: LLM psychotics do not hallucinate. But chatbots do. These hallucinations are often the basis of the user’s delusion. “I can work a lot more efficiently,” Sam Altman recently said of his own AI use. “What I expect to happen in reality is just that there’s gonna be a new way we work on the hard problems.” In this bright future, we will achieve synergy with the machines. We will divide our labor. One party will hallucinate. The other will act on the delusions.\n\nEveryone will be happier then, when it is everyone. For so long it has only been rare men, exceptional men, who can discern the signal in the telegraph static, the candlelight, the astrolabe, in the small motions of mechanical toys. Soon we will all be reunited with our lost spirits. Soon we will be whole again. Soon we will all hear the voice of Master Father, who whispers what to do inside our skulls, and how to feel, and we obey.\n\nIndependent and nonprofit, Boston Review relies on reader funding.

    "title": "Measuring CPU Load",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "In UNIX computing, the system load is a measure of the amount of computational work that a computer system performs. The load average represents the average system load over a period of time. It conventionally appears in the form of three numbers which represent the system load during the last one-, five-, and fifteen-minute periods.\n\nThe Unix load number refers to the number of processes using or waiting for CPU; i.e., the number of processes in the ready queue or run queue. An idle computer has a load number of 0 (the idle process is not counted). Each running process increments the load number by 1. Each process that terminates decrements it by 1. Most UNIX systems count only processes in the running (on CPU) or runnable (waiting for CPU) states (state R).\n\nIn addition to processes in \"R\" state, Linux also includes processes in uninterruptible sleep states (usually waiting for disk activity; state \"D\"), which can lead to markedly different results if many processes remain blocked in I/O due to a busy or stalled I/O system.[1] This, for example, includes processes blocking due to an NFS server failure or too slow media (e.g., USB 1.x storage devices). Such circumstances can result in an elevated load average, which does not reflect an actual increase in CPU use. The idea behind its inclusion is that while disk wait is not the same as CPU-wait, it still reflects how long a user needs to wait.\n\nOn modern UNIX systems, the treatment of threading with respect to load averages varies. Some systems treat threads as processes for the purposes of load average calculation: each thread waiting to run will add 1 to the load. However, other systems, especially systems implementing so-called M:N threading, use different strategies such as counting the process exactly once for the purpose of load (regardless of the number of threads), or counting only threads currently exposed by the user-thread scheduler to the kernel, which may depend on the level of concurrency set on the process. Linux appears to count each thread separately as adding 1 to the load.[2]\n\nThere is no standard way to obtain the length of the run queue across different Unix-like systems,[a] but a commonly-available way is through parsing the output of the ps command, specifically ps -ax -o stat, and counting the number of lines starting with \"R\" (corresponding to processesin the \"R\" state). If desired, one can also add uninterruptible \"disk\" wait state, labelled \"D\" on Linux and FreeBSD, \"U\" on macOS. -M may be used to get per-thread information on Linux and macOS, but not FreeBSD, where the option is instead -H.[4] (The load reported will never be 0, as the ps process itself is counted. To obtain the true load, subtract one from the count.)\n\nOn Linux specifically, the procfs file /proc/stat contains two lines procs_running and procs_blocked, corresponding to scheduling entities (processes/threads) in \"R\" and \"D\" states respectively. This can be used to read the current load instead of ps. As with before, the load reported includes the program currently reading the procfs file, so subtract one from the sum to obtain the true load.[5]\n\nThe comparative study of different load indices carried out by Ferrari et al. reported that CPU load information based upon the CPU queue length does much better in load balancing compared to CPU utilization. The reason CPU queue length did better is probably because when a host is heavily loaded, its CPU utilization is likely to be close to 100%, and it is unable to reflect the exact load level of the utilization. In contrast, CPU queue lengths can directly reflect the amount of load on a CPU. As an example, two systems, one with 3 and the other with 6 processes in the queue, are both very likely to have utilizations close to 100%, although they would obviously differ in terms of process wait-times.[6]\n\nAll Unix and Unix-like systems generate a dimensionless metric of three \"load average\" numbers in the kernel. Users can easily query the current result from a Unix shell by running the uptime command:\n\nThe w and top commands show the same three load average numbers, as do a range of graphical user interface utilities. The underlying interface is getloadavg(), a C function present on most UNIX systems since 4.3BSD-Reno of 1990 (but is not part of POSIX).[7] On Linux specifically, one can also read /proc/loadavg for this information. This file also provides instantaneous information on the number of processes in \"R\" state, the total number of processes, and the process ID of the most-recently-created process.[8]\n\nSystems calculate the load average as the exponentially damped/weighted moving average of the load number. The three values of load average refer to the past one, five, and fifteen minutes of system operation.[9]\n\nMathematically speaking, all three values always average all the system load since the system started up. They all decay exponentially, but they decay at different speeds: they decay exponentially by e after 1, 5, and 15 minutes respectively. Hence, the 1-minute load average consists of 63% (more precisely: 1 - 1/e) of the load from the last minute and 37% (1/e) of the average load since start up, excluding the last minute. For the 5- and 15-minute load averages, the same 63%/37% ratio is computed over 5 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. Therefore, it is not technically accurate that the 1-minute load average only includes the last 60 seconds of activity, as it includes 37% of the activity from the past, but it is correct to state that it includes mostly the last minute.\n\nFor single-CPU systems that are CPU bound, one can think of load average as a measure of system utilization during the respective time period. For systems with multiple CPUs, one must divide the load by the number of processors in order to get a comparable measure.\n\nFor example, one can interpret a load average of \"1.73 0.60 7.98\" on a single-CPU system as:\n\nThis implies that this system could have handled all the work scheduled for the last minute if it were 1.73 times as fast.\n\nIn a system with four CPUs, a load average of 3.73 would indicate that there were, on average, 3.73 processes ready to run. Because this is fewer than 4, we know each one could be scheduled into a CPU, and that no overloading is present.\n\nOn Linux systems, the load-average is not calculated on each clock tick, but driven by a variable value that is based on the HZ frequency setting and tested on each clock tick. This setting defines the kernel clock tick rate in hertz (times per second), and it defaults to 100 for 10 ms ticks. Kernel activities use this number of ticks to time themselves. Specifically, the calc_load() function (in loadavg.h, formerly sched.h), which calculates the load average, nominally runs every LOAD_FREQ (5*HZ+1) ticks, i.e. a tiny bit over 5 s.\n\nThe avenrun array contains 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute average. The calc_load() function provides the correct update of the load-average for the default update rate of LOAD_FREQ (5*HZ+1).[10] It is used like such in loadavg.c (formerly sched.c):[11]\n\nNote this handling of NO_HZ CPUs. NO_HZ is a mode meant to reduce the number of scheduling-clock interrupts on idle processors, which improves power efficiency and reduces clock jitter. This would cause processors to miss their update ticks, however. As a result, the counting of tasks is done using atomic operations. The function calc_global_nohz handles the calculation in case of needing to catch up to multiple ticks, making use of this function:\n\nHere fixed_power_int (not included in article) raises exp to its nth power in fixed-point arithmetic.\n\nThe \"sampled\" calculation of load averages is a somewhat common behavior; FreeBSD, too, only refreshes the value every five seconds. The interval is usually taken to not be exact so that they do not collect processes that are scheduled to fire at a certain moment. This is the reason for \"+1\" in the Linux code from above; FreeBSD instead uses a pseudorandom offset added to the interval.[12]\n\nloadavg.h also mentions that the use of 11 fractional bits in the above fixed point calculation prevents reducing the interval (LOAD_FREQ) much lower. For example, a two-second interval would result in the EXP values becoming 1981, 2034 and 2043, nearly saturating the precision available (0–2047).[10]\n\nRipke Klaus has shown in 2011 that the \"+1\" modification alone is not sufficient to avoid Moiré artifacts from regularly-scheduled processes. His experiments suggest 4.61 to be a better value: 0.61 is close to the golden ratio, which helps spread out the sample-point among fractional seconds. At the same time, 4.61 is close to 60⁄13, so the property of 5 s being an integer fraction of 60 s is maintained.[13][14] Ripke's change is common among Android system kernels, although the exact expression used (4*HZ+61) assumes an HZ of 100.[15] 60*HZ/13 would be more appropriate for varying values of HZ. The new values would be:[14]\n\nAs we've discussed before, most kernels use fixed-point arithmetic to calculate the load average for efficiency and simplicity. This however limits the achievable update-rate and precision. Given that we have established how to get the instantaneous load from userspace, it is also possible to calculate the load average from userspace. The following code does so in Python, using a refresh rate of φ ≈ 1.618 seconds, on time-spans ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour:\n\nOther commands for assessing system performance include:",

    "description": "We’re launching a new agent step in Opal, available for all users today.",
    "fullText": "We’re introducing a new agent step in Opal that turns static workflows into interactive experiences. The agent step understands your objective and figures out the right tools and models it needs to get there.\n\nToday we’re upgrading Opal workflows from static model calls to agentic intelligence. Instead of manually picking a model, you can now select an agent in the \"generate\" step. This agent step proactively determines the best path based on your goal, triggering the right tools and models (like Web Search for research or Veo for Video) to automate complex tasks with less manual configuration.\n\nPreviously, creating a storybook Opal required you to predefine page counts and user questions. Now, we can create a Visual Storyteller Opal where the agent step autonomously decides which details it needs and suggests plot points to help you direct where the story goes. This marks a shift from rigid formats to dynamic, unique narratives shaped by real-time creative decisions.\n\nLet’s take an interior design Opal as an example. Before the agent step, an Interior Design Opal felt like a simple one-way process: upload a picture, input your style, and receive an image of your redesigned space. With the new agent step, your leveled up Room Styler Opal starts to feel interactive and more like another design partner you're collaborating with.\n\nUpload a photo of your empty living room and describe your mid-century modern vision. The agent will generate an initial concept featuring era-specific decor and palettes. If it’s not quite right, you can provide feedback on specific elements. By iterating through this dialogue, the agent refines its grasp of your aesthetic and can even research niche design sub-styles to create redesigned images that feel uniquely yours, rather than a generic showroom template.\n\nOpal can now create these interactive experiences because the agent understands your goal, thinks about the best way to get it done, reaches out to you when it needs your input and recruits the best models and tools to get the job done.\n\nWe believe this approach gives you the best of both worlds: the power of an AI agent working towards your goal and the control of a step-by-step workflow you can customize and refine at any time.\n\nWe’ve kept Opal simple while making it significantly more capable. New users will find that Opals \"just work\" because the agent in the generate step is smart enough to self-correct, remember and optimize. For our power users and builders, the standard fixed steps are available whenever you need high-precision prototyping or rigid logic. By bridging the gap between automation and control, we’re expanding the horizons of what you can build. We can’t wait to see your new agent-powered Opals in action!",

    "description": "A new study suggests vegan diets may be lacking some nutrients that help shield people from colon cancer. Fortification could help.",
    "fullText": "Which diet is the very best diet to reduce cancer risk?\n\nA new study suggests the answer may be something close to a healthy, nutrient-rich vegetarian diet. Still, it doesn't have to be super strict, and can allow for some fish or a bit of meat now and then.\n\nThe study, released in the British Journal of Cancer early Friday, analyzed long-term data from over 1.8 million people worldwide who adhered to five dietary patterns, all with relatively healthy eating habits. The study included:\n\nStudy participants were located in the US, UK, India, and Taiwan. And they were all fairly healthy, not eating a ton of the processed meats such as sausages and bacon that are so often linked with more cancer diagnoses. For example, in the US, one of the big cohorts studied was Seventh-Day Adventists, who consider healthy eating and physical activity an integral part of their religious beliefs.\n\nAfter following participants for an average of 16 years and tracking cases of 17 different types of cancer, a few patterns emerged.\n\nOverall, vegetarians had a lower risk of five kinds of cancer, including some of the most lethal cancers, like breast cancer and prostate cancer. Pescatarians also had a lower risk of colorectal, breast, and kidney cancer, compared to red meat eaters, and poultry-eaters who avoided red meat suffered fewer cases of prostate cancer. But there also appeared to be some cancer-fighting benefits to eating some meat, dairy, or fish. Researchers aren't sure why, but suspect it may be due to the micronutrients in animal products, such as calcium, B vitamins, and riboflavin, that vegetarians and vegans sometimes don't get enough of.\n\n\"We've published many papers on vegetarians over the last 30 years, and we consistently find lower intakes of some micronutrients,\" epidemiologist Tim Key, a professor emeritus at the University of Oxford and co-investigator of the study, said during a briefing. \"I think the data we're getting today suggests there could be deficiencies that you just need long-term data and big numbers to pick up.\"\n\nCompared to meat-eaters, vegetarians in the study had a:\n\nThe study can't answer why meat eaters had a greater risk of developing these cancers, but researchers suspect it may come down to specific compounds in meat that raise blood levels of proteins that can harm our organs over time, rather than anything special about eating extra veggies.\n\n\"It's true, the vegetarians do eat more fiber and more fruit and veg — the differences are not very big,\" Key said. \"My feeling is the differences are more likely to be related to meat itself than to simply the vegetarians eating more healthy foods.\"\n\nStill, there do appear to be some cancer-fighting benefits to eating meat, too. In the study, vegetarians had almost double the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, compared to meat eaters, which investigators said might be related to a lower riboflavin intake. It's impossible to say for sure that the diets caused the differences in cancer risks, since these diets weren't prescribed and the studies were just observational, following people who adhered to their own vegetarian or meat-eating diets for a few decades.\n\n\"We don't know if the vegan or vegetarian diets are objectively 'healthy' or if they simply omit meat and animal products,\" Aisling Daly, a lecturer in nutrition at Oxford Brookes University, who was not involved in the study, said in a release. \"Vegetarian diets can usually be more health-promoting than meat-based diets, but if people are not substituting the meat products appropriately, the intended health benefits may not appear.\"\n\nAccording to the study, vegans had a roughly 40% increased risk of developing colon cancer when compared to meat eaters. That difference, which shocked some nutritionists and public health experts, may stem from calcium deficiencies, investigators said.\n\n\"Calcium intake on average was quite low in vegans,\" Key, the epidemiologist, said.\n\nCalcium is good for preventing colon cancer because it can bind to free fatty acids in the gut and shuttle them out before damage occurs. One study released last year showed that women who consumed the equivalent of a glass of milk a day (300 milligrams of calcium) had a 17% lower risk of developing colorectal cancer.\n\nOf course, you don't have to eat dairy to get plenty of calcium in your diet. Plant foods like spinach, tofu, and chia seeds can also pack a calcium-rich punch.\n\nToday, there aren't meaningful differences in calcium intake between vegans and others, according to more recent data Key has reviewed. \"Presumably largely because of more consumption of more fortified foods, particularly dairy product substitutes,\" he said. It's possible that if we followed today's vegans 20 or 30 years into the future, they wouldn't develop any more colon cancer than their meat-eating peers.\n\nIt's also possible that modern vegetarian and vegan diets aren't as healthy as they used to be, and that could change the cancer risk equation, too.\n\n\"The data used in this study come from groups of people who were recruited at least 10 years ago — and in some cases as far back as the 1980s,\" nutrition scientist Nerys Astbury from the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the new study, said in a statement. \"Eating habits change over time. In the past, vegetarian and vegan diets were typically based on whole foods such as vegetables, beans, lentils, and pulses. Today, however, many vegetarian and vegan diets include a growing number of highly processed meat and dairy alternatives.\"\n\nA growing body of research suggests those plant-based convenience foods may not be so great for our health.\n\nThis study doesn't change much about what we know you can do to improve your diet and lower your cancer risk. The basic advice to eat your veggies, enjoy red meat in moderation, and avoid ultra-processed meats like hot dogs most of the time still applies here.\n\nEarlier studies of vegetarians and pescatarians have similarly suggested that there are brain health and longevity benefits to eating a little bit of fish — and maybe even some meat — now and then. Healthy fats in fish, olive oil, avocados, and nuts seem to do a lot for our long-term health.",

    "description": "The billionaire's move to slash nearly half of Block's workforce in one fell swoop signals a departure from Big Tech's pattern of repeated cuts.",
    "fullText": "CEO Jack Dorsey is departing from the classic tech layoff playbook — and it could be a sign of what's to come.\n\nIn a post on X on Thursday, the billionaire said he's slashing nearly half of Block's workforce, cutting its over 10,000-person staff to just under 6,000. He said that he is doing this despite the business being strong and profits growing.\n\nIn the tech industry's hardcore era, many companies have pared down teams through repeated rounds of layoffs. Dorsey's massive chop stands alone. \n\nIn his memo, the cofounder and CEO said repeated rounds of layoffs are \"destructive to morale,\" focus, and to the trust of customers and shareholders. He said he'd rather do the cuts in one fell swoop.\n\n\"I'd rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,\" Dorsey wrote in the post.\n\nThe company appears to have conducted repeated rounds of cuts in recent months, Wired reported.\n\nBecause repeated cuts create \"layoff fatigue and chronic anxiety,\" as well as drops in morale and productivity, it's better to make a single reduction rather than piecemeal ones, Brooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, told Business Insider.\n\nNevertheless, the size of the cut is notable, he said.\n\n\"This is a pretty extreme example in terms of the amount of people that are being let go all at once, but the packages are relatively generous,\" Holtom said.\n\nDorsey wrote that laid-off employees would receive 20 weeks of base pay, plus an additional week for each year of tenure. Their equity will continue vesting through the end of May, and they'll receive six months of health coverage. The company is also allowing them to keep their corporate devices and will provide a $5,000 payment.\n\nThe move to lay off over 40% of the company's workforce signals a departure from the typical pattern followed by other Big Tech companies. It also raises the question of whether other firms will follow a similar trend, and some industry leaders have already commented on the move.\n\n\"Feels inevitable this is about to ripple through every public company. We've gotta find a way to make everyone an owner w/ some exposure to the upside as the # of employees falls off a cliff,\" Jessica Verrilli, managing director and cofounder at Adverb Ventures said in a post on X.\n\nDorsey said that he's adapting to an era in which technology is dramatically changing the workplace.\n\n\"We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we're creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company,\" Dorsey said in his memo on X.\n\nIn the company's earnings call on Thursday, he said that more companies will follow suit in using AI to drive efficiency gains. Block is already ahead of the trend that \"all companies will eventually\" adopt, Dorsey said.\n\nMichael Blank, an assistant professor of finance at Stanford Business School, told Business Insider that there could be a race among CEOs to convince investors that their companies are better positioned than their rivals to adopt abruptly changing AI technologies. Mass layoffs would be a potentially inexpensive way to signal that, he said.\n\nShares of Block were up over 20% in after-hours trading.\n\nBlock's layoffs come in the wake of a viral report from research firm Citrini on February 22, that raised fears about the impact of AI and sent stocks tumbling. Citrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, laid out a predictive scenario in which AI continues to grow but proves detrimental to the broader economy.\n\nA number of tech leaders have also been warning of a fundamental erosion of white-collar work.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei has sounded the alarm about a looming white-collar \"bloodbath,\" while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said AI is reshaping what individual employees can achieve.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like Klarna have been more explicit about replacing human workers. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said its workforce has halved over the last four years and will shrink further in the coming years. The company had 7,000 employees in 2022 and he said he expects the company's workforce to drop below 2,000 by 2030.\n\nNot everyone is convinced the end times are here for desk workers. While the World Economic Forum's 2026 Global Risk report predicts that 92 million workers will be displaced by 2030, it also said 170 million roles will be created in that time frame, resulting in a net increase.",

    "description": "We are going to have lots of questions about the WBD-Paramount tie-up. But explaining why Netflix bailed is more straightfoward.",
    "fullText": "Investors didn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nRepublicans didn't want the deal to happen, either.\n\nThat's the cleanest and most likely explanation for Netflix walking away from the $83 billion transaction it agreed to a few months ago.\n\nNetflix's move means that, barring something very surprising, Larry and David Ellison's Paramount will end up owning all of WBD: not just the movie/TV studio and HBO, which Netflix wanted to buy, but its collection of TV networks as well, including CNN.\n\nWe may hear other explanations for the Netflix move in coming days. But my educated guess is that this is a real Occam's situation:\n\nAt one point, Ted Sarandos and company thought they had done enough to win over Donald Trump, which is what you need to get a merger done in 2026.\n\nBut Trump never announced that he would actually favor Netflix's bid over the Ellisons', who have done a lot of work to woo Trump. At a congressional hearing earlier this month, Netflix got a taste of the pushback it would get from Republicans, who accused the company of pushing woke content on its subscribers.\n\nAnd last weekend, Trump reminded Netflix of his penchant for pushing around American companies from his bully pulpit, when he demanded that Netflix fire a board member who offended him. It's worth noting that Netflix's Thursday announcement came hours after Sarandos visited the White House. If he was looking for assurances that the Trump administration would back his deal, it doesn't seem like he got them.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix shareholders had been signalling their distaste for the deal for weeks by pushing down the company's stock. Netflix shares began rebounding this week as it became clear that Paramount's chances of winning the deal were getting better. (They shot up 10% in the hours after Netflix bailed out.)\n\nSo Netflix's surrender makes plenty of sense: If your investors don't want the deal, and the people who need to approve the deal don't want the deal, what options do you really have?\n\nWhat all of this means for WBD and its various assets is way too early to tell. Will Bari Weiss, who was installed as the head of CBS News last year, now oversee CNN, as well? Will HBO employees, who seemed cautiously optimistic about going to work for Netflix, feel the same way about the Ellisons? What about the people running the Warner Bros. studio, who have been on a historic hot streak?\n\nAnd while we're asking questions: In December, Paramount said $24 billion of its financing would come from three Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi. Is that still the plan? I've asked Paramount for comment.\n\nWe will have plenty of time to speculate and report about all of that.\n\nOne thing we do know: Assuming Paramount's deal goes through, it will mean the Ellison family, who were minor players in media just a year ago, will now be titans: They'll control a conglomerate that owns two movie studios, two major news operations, two major streaming services, and a broadcast network with a long-running NFL deal. And Larry Ellison's Oracle now owns a piece of TikTok's US operations.\n\nThat's an astonishingly large and influential portfolio for any owner, let alone a family with a minimal track record running media companies.\n\nIt's also a family that has repeatedly tried to convince Donald Trump that they're in his corner. Granted, the reality may be more complicated than the optics — people who complain about Paramount firing Trump critic Stephen Colbert, for instance, tend not to say much about Paramount re-signing Trump critics Jon Stewart and the South Park guys.\n\nBut the facts are the facts: Last fall, David Ellison told us his family had a good relationship with Trump. On Thursday, we saw the likely benefits of that relationship.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "description": "Peacock's hit show \"The Traitors,\" has proven a powerful PR tool for reality villains and TV stars. Look no further than season four's breakout star, Rob Rausch.",
    "fullText": "One might assume that TV personalities appear on Peacock's murder-mystery competition show \"The Traitors\" for a paycheck and attention. But the savviest among the cast know the show's real prize is something money can't buy: redemption.\n\nThe series, a \"Mafia\"-esque game in which contestants must guess what \"Traitors\" are among them, while the Traitors must lie their way to the end of the game, might not seem like the friendliest environment for a celebrity or reality star looking to rehabilitate their image.\n\nBut over four seasons, the show has made viral stars and renewed celebrities out of several of its famous cast members, earning a reputation as the best cottage industry for celebrity image rehab this side of \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\n\nWho knew a show about lying and manipulating could make you so beloved?\n\n\"The Traitors\" has always had a taste for the devilish ones. Hosted with campy flourish by Alan Cumming and filmed in a 19th-century castle in the Scottish Highlands, the show leans heavily into its calling card as a game of deception. As such, it's attracted all manner of niche celebrities, many of whom come from competition shows like \"Survivor,\" \"Big Brother,\" and MTV's \"The Challenge,\" which require strategy; or social reality shows like Bravo's \"Real Housewives,\" which arguably relies on a fair amount of interpersonal strategizing and lying for sport.\n\nBut the breakout star of \"The Traitors\" season four — which has been viewed for billions of minutes on Peacock since its January premiere, its biggest audience yet — isn't a gamer or a Housewife. It's someone who caught the casting director's attention not by strategizing and scheming, but by coupling up and kissing on cue.\n\nRob Rausch emerged from the neon-lit \"Love Island\" Villa in 2024 with a polarizing reputation. He'd dated and then promptly dumped Leah Kateb, a season six fan favorite, to chase a hot new bombshell who'd caught his eye. (No, really, the newcomers on \"Love Island\" are called \"bombshells.\") While Kateb struggled with hurt and confusion about his change of heart, viewers grew suspicious of Rausch's Southern charm and snake tattoos; save for one memorable meltdown, Rausch was mostly inscrutable as the Villa's chaos swirled around him. In a postmortem interview with Alex Cooper, he summarized the feedback he received online: \"Basically, I'm a toxic gaslighter, but I'm hot enough that it doesn't matter.\"\n\nRausch has said he turned down \"The Traitors\" multiple times because he didn't want more drama. But from the moment he set foot on Scottish soil to film season four, he shrewdly leveraged his past drama to draw the spotlight.\n\n\"I honestly think I'll make a good Traitor. I'm hard to read,\" Rausch said in the season four premiere. \"I've been told that by every girl I've ever dated.\"\n\nWhen Rausch was selected for the titular role, he picked off his costars one by one — including his fellow Traitors — with ease while remaining impressively unsuspected. In addition to earning praise for his strategic gameplay and knack for social manipulation, he was shown sticking up for his friends, playfully meowing at the camera, and quoting Mark Twain.\n\nIn one of the final episodes, fellow Traitor Eric Nam compared Rob to an eagle soaring above the fray, his feathers unruffled. Fellow cast member and \"Real Housewives\" star Dorinda Medley even said she was flattered to be targeted by Rausch for elimination. \"He can do no wrong in my book,\" she said. \"I'm getting murdered, and I have butterflies.\"\n\nThe viewers at home agreed. The qualities that made Rausch a villain in the \"Love Island\" Villa were the same ones that led to success and stardom in the \"Traitors\" castle, where everyone has signed up for a game of paranoia and deception.\n\n\"Rob came in carrying a 'Love Island' reputation for manipulation layered over with charm, and 'The Traitors' is essentially a format where those two qualities stop being a liability and start being a competitive advantage,\" Evan Nierman, CEO of the global PR firm Red Banyan, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the season unfolded, Rausch's scene-stealing moves inspired flattering headlines and countless TikTok fancams set to songs like Saweetie's \"My Type,\" Kendrick Lamar's \"Like That,\" and Taylor Swift's \"Cancelled!\" On his own Instagram page, Rausch has flaunted brand partnerships with Sonic and Celsius, as well as his clothing brand, Creek Rat, to over 1.7 million followers.\n\nOut of \"Love Island\" infamy, a star was born. With the space to show more of his personality in a different context outside of a dating series, Nierman said \"The Traitors\" has given Rausch a \"multi-dimensional public profile.\"\n\n\"Viewers observe you problem-solving under pressure, forming real friendships, navigating betrayal, and handling the game's emotional weight in real time,\" he said. \"That's character evidence more persuasive than anything a publicist could engineer from the outside.\"\n\nSince the first US season debuted in 2023, \"The Traitors\" has become appointment TV for reality fans.\n\nJuliana Martins, celebrity publicist and Founder of Eleven11 Media Relations, said she's had requests coming in \"left and right\" from talent agents asking how they can get their clients cast on \"The Traitors.\"\n\n\"A show like this, from a publicity perspective, is phenomenal,\" Martins said. \"It's also so competitive to get on now because everybody wants it.\"\n\nBecause the game requires a certain amount of backstabbing and deception, even from the so-called Faithfuls — whose job it is to stay alive and sniff out the Traitors while voting to boot one player per episode — the show is high risk, high reward for those looking to reenter the news cycle.\n\n\"It really catapults reality stars into other opportunities,\" Martins explained. \"Dylan Efron, for example, reached a broader audience through 'Traitors,' and then he went on to do 'Dancing With the Stars.'\"\n\nEfron, previously best known as Zac Efron's younger brother, appeared on season three and — spoiler alert! — won the show with a small group of Faithfuls, including former \"Bachelorette\" Gabby Windey, who said appearing on \"The Traitors\" was \"the best thing I've done for my career.\"\n\nRob Mariano, aka \"Survivor\" legend Boston Rob, also starred on season three and parlayed his renewed visibility into a cohosting gig on the official \"Traitors\" podcast. He and Efron have transformed their in-castle \"bromance\" into a professional partnership.\n\n\"For legacy reality stars like Boston Rob, returning to a really popular series can reintroduce them to a new audience, new viewers, while also still re-engaging fans,\" Martins said. \"It can lead to future casting opportunities, brand partnerships, hosting gigs, and other opportunities that really contribute to their career longevity and their overall perception.\"\n\nPeter Weber, a former \"Bachelor\" star, received a hero's edit on season two thanks to his bold gameplay, keen instincts, and self-branding as the ultimate Faithful.\n\nMartins, who previously worked with Weber on the promotional campaign for his 2021 children's book and has advised him on other projects, attributed his success on \"The Traitors\" to the show's unique format.\n\n\"Most reality shows are built around a specific narrative framework. 'The Bachelor' centers on finding one true love, and because of that structure, that editing and the storytelling, they're designed to support that one core goal and theme, which I think limits how somebody can fully show their personality,\" Martins explained.\n\n\"In Peter Weber's case, viewers really saw qualities that have been a part of who he is, but weren't really highlighted on his original seasons of 'The Bachelorette' or 'The Bachelor,'\" Martins said. \"'The Traitors' gave audiences a fuller understanding of him, rather than redefining him.\"\n\nStill, that opportunity for a less restricted, more complex arc can be a double-edged sword (or, in the case of \"The Traitors,\" a double-edged dagger).\n\n\"The exposure can cut both ways,\" Martins said. \"The 'Traitors' format does leave very little room to hide.\"\n\nSeason four's resident \"Bachelor\" star is Colton Underwood, a former pro football player who had a tumultuous ride on the dating show. (His most famous scene involved him hopping a massive fence to escape the camera crew.)\n\nAfter coming out as gay in 2021, Underwood found himself back in the reality TV conversation with \"The Traitors. Though he was hoping to be cast as a Traitor, he was ultimately made a Faithful, , and his aggressive gameplay ultimately made him a target both in the castle and on social media. He flung out accusations and dominated the roundtable debates. After he rallied his castmates to erroneously banish Tiffany Mitchell, she wrote on X, \"It's actually fuck Colton Underwood and I said that shit.\"\n\nThough Underwood did accurately guess that \"Real Housewives\" alum Lisa Rinna was a Traitor, he did so in a memorable scene where he threatened to blackmail her in the game, detailing a plan to \"hold her hostage.\" This language prompted many viewers to recirculate stalking accusations from Underwood's ex-girlfriend, Cassie Randolph, who filed a restraining order against him in 2020. (She later dropped the order, and Underwood said at the time that he and Randolph \"were able to reach a private agreement.\")\n\nIf Underwood hoped to use \"The Traitors\" to recover or distract from his past, it backfired. Many viewers criticized his energy as off-putting, unlikable, and overconfident. The Cut published an article titled, \"Colton Underwood's Reality-TV Rebrand Isn't Going Very Well.\" Meanwhile, Rausch is the latest star of the publication's \"Dream Date\" series.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Underwood's representative said he had \"the best time\" on the show.\n\n\"Colton came into Traitors Season 4 as a fan of the franchise ready to play the game. Since leaving the castle, he has continued to expand his network and slate. His involvement in the show is one he's truly grateful for.\"\n\nHistorically, villains from other TV shows have fared well on \"The Traitors.\" Infamous \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was dubbed by The New York Times as \"the most hated man in America\" after a very public cheating scandal, but bumbled through \"The Traitors\" season three with little to no backlash.\n\n\"I was like, Tom Sandoval's here? Damn, this guy's still getting gigs? It's good controversy,\" Windey told Variety. \"And then who knew? He actually kind of redeemed himself — he was the village idiot.\"\n\nNierman also cited Phaedra Parks — who was fired from \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" in 2017 after admitting to spreading harmful rumors about a fellow Housewife — as a cast member who had a massive reputational shift after appearing on \"The Traitors.\" In a game that rewards wit and discernment, her snappy one-liners and cutting takedowns at the round table went viral, and the moments helped all be forgiven by viewers. Her return to \"Real Housewives\" was announced shortly thereafter.\n\nVanzil Burke, who was Parks' manager at the time, said the rumor-spreading scandal \"almost destroyed\" Parks' career, but her popularity on \"The Traitors\" reopened doors for her.\n\n\"It was needed for her professional career,\" Burke told Business Insider. \"I had no doubt that she would go in, read the room, and handle it.\"\n\nBeing a Traitor allowed Parks to play up her \"bad girl\" persona, Burke said, while also proving to viewers that she'd matured and mellowed since she last appeared onscreen.\n\nStill, as with every PR maneuver, one size doesn't fit all.\n\nRausch, Sandoval, and Parks read as authentic because they didn't try to hide their notoriety, turning their perceived flaws — cunning, cluelessness, and shady reads, respectively — into assets. On the flip side, Nierman said Underwood lacked humility and self-awareness.\n\n\"The foundational rule of reputation repair is showing people you understand why they distrust you,\" Nierman said. \"Colton walked into the castle and did the opposite by immediately positioning himself as the leader of the Faithfuls in a way that confirmed every instinct that viewers already had about his controlling tendencies.\"\n\n\"If the arc feels like a calculated PR move rather than genuine growth, then audiences will not only reject it but be even more against you,\" Nierman added.\n\nUltimately, the real winners of \"The Traitors\" aren't the players who go home with a portion of the prize pot (somewhere around $250,000, depending on their success in challenges). It's the players who emerge with the public's favor, a busy phone line, and maybe even a comeback story.",

    "fullText": "Jack Dorsey said he's still hiring for his fintech company Block — even after he just laid off 40% of its workforce.\n\nThe cofounder said during an earnings call on Thursday that he expects to bring in more senior AI engineering talent to the team. The company's stock was up nearly 23% after trading hours as of 7 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey said in a memo to employees that Block was cutting its head count from 10,000 people to \"just under 6,000.\" The reason, he said, was because AI is unlocking \"a new way of working\" with \"smaller and flatter teams.\"\n\n\"We're not making this decision because we're in trouble. Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving,\" Dorsey wrote in the memo. \"But something has changed.\"\n\nDorsey said in an earnings call on Thursday that AI tools have increased productivity at the company with a 40% increase in production code shipment per engineer since September.\n\n\"We've seen engineering work that would have taken weeks to complete be done by a small team in a fraction of the time with agentic coding tools,\" he said.\n\nDespite the layoffs, Dorsey said during the call that Block expects to invest in hiring.\n\n\"We see meaningful opportunity to invest in our people and invest in hiring, invest in retaining a world-class team to deliver for our customers; ultimately, we expect to hire some more senior AI engineering talent who will continue to level up our engineering and product capabilities,\" he said.\n\nDorsey and a spokesperson for Block did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAI's impact is being felt across industries and roles, as companies find ways to automate work. One study by Stanford University researchers found that early-career positions in fields such as software engineering and customer service are on the decline.\n\nSome workers have also said that their responsibilities have increased with AI. A software engineer told Business Insider that the simultaneous increase in productivity and workload is leading to \"AI fatigue.\"",

    "fullText": "Want to make big bucks in AI without a technical background? There still might be room for you.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a Thursday post on X that \"people who are not technical\" can work on developing artificial general intelligence — in research recruiting.\n\n\"We believe the best research teams are built through context, taste and a real feel for where the field is headed next; research recruiting is about finding people who will move the frontier forward, not just filling roles,\" Altman wrote.\n\nHe added that Tifa Chen, OpenAI's head of research recruiting, is \"looking for exceptional recruiters from non-traditional backgrounds, former founders especially.\"\n\n\"Taste\" generally refers to having proper, decisive, and well-supported takes on the direction in which projects should go. It's wading through AI slop and drivel to surface gems.\n\nIf you have good decision-making skills, or if you have the chops to call yourself a connoisseur of something, that could be proof of good taste.\n\nThe great taste debate has long been brewing in the AI sphere. It resurfaced after Y Combinator founder Paul Graham posted on X on February 14 about taste in AI.\n\n\"When anyone can make anything, the big differentiator is what you choose to make,\" Graham wrote.\n\nOpenAI's president, Greg Brockman, wrote on X several days later that \"taste is a new core skill.\"\n\nAfter these takes from AI's top dogs, memes on \"taste\" went viral on social media, as Business Insider's Henry Chandonnet reported — mostly because whether one has \"good taste\" or not is highly subjective.\n\nTo be sure, tech's takes on taste go even further back. Apple's Steve Jobs, for one, said in a 1995 CBS interview that making great products \"ultimately, it comes down to taste.\"\n\n\"Picasso had a saying: good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas,\" Jobs said. \"And I think part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.\"",

    "fullText": "Jack Dorsey's announcement on Thursday that Block was slashing its workforce nearly in half sent shockwaves through the tech world.\n\nDorsey, Block's CEO and cofounder, said AI was rapidly changing work at the financial services company, which owns Square, Cash App, and Afterpay.\n\n\"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better,\" he said on Thursday's earnings call, shortly after the reduction in force was shared on X.\n\n\"I had two options: cut gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now,\" he wrote in a memo. \"I chose the latter.\"\n\nBlock's stock was up over 20% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Shares were down more than 16% in the last year as of market close on Thursday.\n\nLeaders in tech and venture capital quickly reacted to the news, with some saying it could be the first of what's to come as AI fundamentally transforms companies and the nature of work. Others were more skeptical of AI's role.\n\nHere's what smart people are saying about the job cuts at Block.\n\n\"This is the first AI cut,\" tech investor Balaji Srinivasan said on X. \"And it will send shockwaves.\"\n\nThe Silicon Valley venture capitalist said the Block cuts were a \"signal to everyone in tech: get good now. Become indispensable. Work nights and weekends. Learn the AI tools and raise your game. Or you might not make the cut, as an employee or as a company.\"\n\n\"Block is the canary in the coal mine,\" Aakash Gupta, host of \"The Growth Podcast,\" said on X. \"And they're not alone.\"\n\nGupta said Dorsey \"said the quiet part out loud: intelligence tools paired with smaller teams have already changed what it means to run a company.\"\n\n\"Block went from 10,000 to 6,000 while growing revenue and raising guidance. Every CEO running a company with more than a few thousand employees is doing this math tonight,\" he added. \"The canary just stopped singing.\"\n\nBen Carlson, a financial analyst and director at Ritholtz Wealth Management, expressed skepticism that the cuts were purely driven by AI innovation, sharing a chart that shows Block's share price is down sharply from its high point in 2021.\n\n\"Maybe Block laying off a ton of employees is a sign that AI is gonna destroy everything,\" he wrote on X. \"Or maybe the stock is down 80% from the highs and they overhired and AI is a convenient excuse.\"\n\nJason Calacanis, angel investor and co-host of the \"All-In\" podcast, praised Dorsey for the cuts.\n\n\"Leadership is hard, but this feels like (another) visionary move,\" he said on X. \"Have never sold a share, since being a private investor in square.\"\n\n\"Feels inevitable this is about to ripple through every public company,\" Jessica Verrilli, cofounder of VC firm Adverb Ventures, said on X. \"We've gotta find a way to make everyone an owner w/ some exposure to the upside as the # of employees falls off a cliff.\"\n\n\"Respect to @jack for doing the hard thing,\" Shaun Maguire, partner at Sequoia Capital, wrote on X. \"While doing it intentionally and owning the decision.\"\n\n\"Square is just the beginning,\" Clara Shih, a startup investor and senior advisor at Meta, said in an X post. \"Every CEO faces the same decision today that manufacturing CEOs did in 2000: do a big layoff or your competitor will, pass on cost savings to customers and investors, and beat you.\"\n\n\"In 2000, jobs were lost to Shenzhen. In 2026, jobs will be lost to AI,\" she added.\n\nMatt Shumer, an AI CEO who wrote the viral \"Something Big is Happening\" essay earlier this month, said this is \"one of the first major examples of AI driving layoffs, but certainly not the last.\"\n\n\"If you're saying 'this won't happen to me', re-evaluate your thoughts.

    "title": "Jack Dorsey struck an 'empathetic' tone as he laid off nearly half of Block",
    "description": "The CEO's empathetic and transparent tone and a relatively generous layoff package, are gaining respect amid a 40% workforce reduction at Block.",
    "fullText": "The CEO of Block is striking a different tone as the company executes massive layoffs.\n\nJack Dorsey, who cofounded the company behind Square, Cash App, and Afterpay, announced on Thursday that the company will lay off more than 40% of its workforce. Dorsey said in his memo that \"intelligence tools\" have enabled \"a new way of working.\"\n\nBlock shares surged in after-hours trading, and so are fears that AI might quickly displace jobs, but the tone of Dorsey's layoff memo is also becoming a focal point on X, with some users praising his leadership.\n\nDorsey said that anyone laid off will receive 20 weeks of salary plus one week for every year of tenure, have equity vested through the end of May, six months of healthcare, be given their corporate devices, and an additional $5,000.\n\nThis offering differs from others in the tech space. For example, Amazon's severance package tied to layoffs in January included pay for 90 days and healthcare benefits that continue through the last day of the month when employment ends.\n\nOn top of that, Dorsey said that departing employees wouldn't \"just disappear\" from Slack and email, and would be given several hours to say goodbye.\n\n\"I had two options: cut gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now. I chose the latter,\" wrote Dorsey. \"Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead.\"\n\n\"To those of you leaving…I'm grateful for you, and I'm sorry to put you through this. You built what this company is today,\" Dorsey added. \"That's a fact that I'll honor forever. This decision is not a reflection of what you contributed.\"\n\nMany large companies have made repeated layoffs over the years. Amazon, for example, has had consecutive years of layoffs since 2022, cutting around 27,000 corporate positions in 2023, a few smaller trims in the hundreds in 2024, limited to specific teams, and a reduction of about 14,000 corporate workers in October 2025. Block itself has had several rounds of smaller staff cuts over the last several years.\n\nThe apologetic tone of Dorsey's statement also stands in contrast to other memos that made recent headlines. That includes one from AT&T CEO John Stankey in August, which boiled down to get on board with his plan or leave. Alexandr Wang sent out a memo with a more forward-looking tone, which said that the company is still hiring and investing, while Meta's Superintelligence Labs division laid off 600 workers.\n\nBrooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, told Business Insider that the tone of Dorsey's layoff memo was aligned with recommendations from good management research.\n\nHoltom pointed to the opening line — \"Today we're making one of the hardest decisions in the history of our company\" — as \"a good way to start,\" because it signals that \"this isn't easy.\" Holtom also said that the company \"cut right to the chase, which is best practice with bad news,\" before shifting to an explanation of what the cuts are meant to accomplish.\n\nHoltom said that Dorsey's message included \"sympathetic sentences or even paragraphs\" directed at departing employees.\n\nIn Holtom's opinion, the package for those leaving is also \"relatively generous, and the message is, 'We take responsibility. What we're doing is trying to position us for the future.'\"\n\n\"The tone of the message,\" said Holtom, \"Is empathetic.\"\n\nEven as Dorsey expressed regret for the laid-off workers, he underscored that the decision was not a response to deteriorating business conditions, writing, \"We're not making this decision because we're in trouble. Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow.\"\n\nFor some who are now out of a job, the message that the company is financially healthy might only sharpen questions about why the cuts were necessary.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Dorsey held a tense all-hands video call during which staffers added dozens of \"thumbs down\" emojis to the screen, The New York Times reported. He wore a black hat emblazoned with the word \"LOVE,\" the newspaper said, citing two employees who participated in the meeting.\n\nDuring the call, an employee questioned whether Dorsey's choice of headwear was appropriate as he moved to cut nearly half the company's workforce, the Times said.\n\nBlock's layoff comes at a time when white collar workers face a tough job market and the threat of AI. A recently viral report by Citrini Research projected a 2028 scenario in which AI replaced too many white-collar workers too quickly, triggering a widespread recession that ultimately led to the stagnation of AI due to a lack of financial resources.",

    "fullText": "The US military shot down a Customs and Border Protection drone over Texas on Thursday, according to three Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has expanded a temporary airspace closure around Fort Hancock for \"special security reasons,\" two weeks after a separate incident over nearby El Paso prompted flight restrictions for several hours.\n\nHowever, the FAA told Business Insider in a statement that commercial flights would not be affected this time.\n\n\"A temporary flight restriction (TFR) was already in place around the Fort Hancock area,\" the statement said. \"The TFR has been expanded to include a greater radius to ensure safety. \"\n\nIn a joint statement, the Pentagon and the US Customs and Border Patrol said the incident had involved US forces employing counter-drone measures to \"mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace.\"\n\n\"The engagement took place far away from populated areas, and there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity,\" the statement said.\n\nThe incident did not mention any friendly-fire cases, but said that the FAA, Border Protection, and the Defense Department would \"continue to work on increased cooperation and communication to prevent such incidents in the future.\"\n\nIt added that the three agencies were working to combat drone threats from \"Mexican cartels and foreign terrorist organizations\" at the US-Mexico border. Fort Hancock is located on the US southern border.\n\nTop Democratic lawmakers in the House Transportation and Homeland Security committees said on Thursday evening that the incident had involved the Defense Department shooting down the Border Protection drone with a \"high-risk counter-unmanned aircraft system.\"\n\nThe term is often used to describe anti-drone lasers, but the lawmakers issuing the statement — Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, and Rep. André Carson of Indiana — did not specify the name of the system.\n\n\"We said months ago that the White House's decision to sidestep a bipartisan, tri-committee bill to appropriately train C-UAS operators and address the lack of coordination between the Pentagon, DHS, and the FAA was a short-sighted idea,\" the statement said. \"Now, we're seeing the result of its incompetence.\"\n\nIt's not immediately clear when the incident occurred, or if the airspace closure around Fort Hancock is directly related.\n\nThe previous airspace closure over El Paso, which The New York Times reported was prompted by the downing of a party balloon, had also involved the use of an anti-drone laser.\n\nThe FAA's restriction is scheduled to last until June 24, though it's unclear if the closure will remain for the full listed duration. The El Paso closure was initially scheduled to last 10 days, but was lifted after a few hours.\n\nFebruary 27, 2026: This story was updated to reflect a joint statement from the Pentagon and the US Customs and Border Patrol.",

    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence may outperform most investors at sifting through data, but legendary investor Howard Marks says the best investors still have qualities it can't fully replicate.\n\n\"Great investors are much more than fast, unemotional processors of data,\" Marks, the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, wrote in a memo published Thursday. His firm manages $223 billion.\n\nThis includes dealing with genuinely new situations and the ability to make \"subjective decisions regarding qualitative factors and exercise taste and discernment,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile AI may be able to generate hypotheses from historical patterns, Marks questioned whether its speculation about new things would be \"consistently superior to that of all humans.\"\n\n\"Because a lot of the investing process comes down to speculation, and because of AI's less-than-total reliability, I think it's unlikely that AI will be infallible as an investor,\" Marks wrote.\n\nHe sees one more crucial difference.\n\n\"AI doesn't have skin in the game,\" Marks wrote. \"It doesn't feel the weight of concentrated positions or the fear of capital loss.\"\n\nTop investors have an instinctive feel for risk, which plays a major role in their success, he added.\n\nIf widely available information can't deliver an edge, Marks wrote, investment superiority has to be found in judgment and qualitative assessment — including \"divining companies' futures.\"\n\n\"By definition, few people are highly superior at performing these non-quantitative tasks — put simply, few possess exceptional insight,\" he wrote.\n\nThat leaves room, in his view, for a subset of investors to stand apart.\n\n\"I believe there will continue to be human investors who are superior to AI, since I don't think AI will be able to do an unbeatable job of these things,\" Marks wrote.\n\nFor many investors, however, the bar is rising.\n\nMarks argues that the advantage many active managers once sought in timely, readily available data is disappearing.\n\nThe competitive pressure in investing is part of a broader shift he sees unfolding.\n\nIn December, he called the technology's employment outlook \"terrifying.\"\n\n\"I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can't find jobs because of it,\" Marks wrote at the time.",

Discovery.\n\nNetflix backed out — and stands to pocket $2.8 billion in breakup fees — after the Larry and David Ellison-run company made a higher bid.\n\nHere's what smart people in business and politics are saying about the deal.\n\nThe cofounder of wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki, which manages $4 billion, joked about the economics of the deal on X. WBD owes Netflix nearly $3 billion in a breakup fee.\n\n\"Haha. They paid $110 billion. Netflix gets $2.8 billion. Zaslov laughing to the bank. Welcome to Hollywood kid,\" Gerber said of WBD CEO David Zaslav.\n\nOn Monday, Gerber posted that Paramount could \"way overpay\" for WBD, allowing Netflix to \"walk away with Billions and a huge win saddling paramount with losses forever.\"\n\nThe Wharton School assistant professor, who researches mergers and acquisitions, wrote in an X post that the deal gave Netflix a way out.\n\n\"What is surprising to me is the speed with which Netflix had pulled out, and I respect their choice not to pretend they're still in it and prolong the game,\" Nary wrote.\n\n\"If WBD had indications of Netflix losing their faith in the deal, the change in their tone towards Paramount, dialing back their expectations for the headline price - all of these make sense now,\" Nary added.\n\nThe Democratic senator opposed last year's Paramount-Skydance merger and has scrutinized the latest company deal.\n\nIn a statement, Warren raised questions about the White House's alignment with Paramount Skydance.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that he was staying out of the battle for WBD — and that both bidders had called him. He said the deal would go to the Department of Justice.\n\n\"A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. merger is an antitrust disaster threatening higher prices and fewer choices for American families,\" Warren said.\n\nShe added, \"A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want.\"\n\nThe lawmaker said, \"It'll be up to the American people to speak up and state attorneys general to enforce the law.\"\n\nOn Thursday, California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement that the transaction was \"not a done deal.\"\n\n\"The California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are in Jordan for a visit centred on humanitarian work, but without any formal engagement with the country's senior royals.\n\nWhile the duke and duchess met health officials, aid partners, and young people at refugee initiatives, their trip has drawn attention for the absence of meetings with the Jordanian royals.\n\nThe involvement of British diplomats has also sparked debate about Prince Harry and Meghan's trip, adding a political undercurrent to what was otherwise a charity-focused tour.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have reportedly received a subdued reception during their brief visit to Jordan, with no formal engagement arranged between them and the country's senior royals.\n\nHarry and Meghan arrived in Amman late Tuesday and quickly began a packed schedule of humanitarian-focused appearances.\n\nTheir itinerary has included visits to local charities and health-related initiatives, as well as a gathering at the British Ambassador's residence attended by World Health Organization (WHO) representatives and embassy staff.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the ambassador's involvement has prompted criticism in some quarters, given the couple's status as non-working royals.\n\nDespite Harry and Meghan's presence in Amman, local sources indicated that they were \"snubbed\" by the senior royals as \"there is no meeting scheduled between the Duke and Duchess [of Sussex] and the Jordanian Royal Family.\"\n\nThe only Jordanian royal the couple reportedly encountered was Princess Basma Bint Talal, an aunt of the King, during a visit connected to the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development.\n\nInstead of appearing alongside Harry and Meghan, Abdullah held talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and separately met WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nOfficial photographs from those meetings did not include the Sussexes, even though their Archewell Foundation has partnered with the WHO.\n\nBritain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, visited Amman's Specialty Hospital and met medical evacuees from Gaza who are receiving treatment there pic.twitter.com/ljRBAfsGJG\n\n— Reuters (@Reuters) February 26, 2026\n\nObservers have speculated whether the absence of a royal welcome reflects scheduling conflicts or a more deliberate distancing.\n\nSome royal commentators suggest that, given the close relationship between the Jordanian and British royal households, dating back to the friendship between the late Queen Elizabeth II and King Hussein, a formal audience might have been expected.\n\nOne royal insider said Harry and Meghan may be \"disappointed\" not to have been able to meet the King or Crown Prince of Jordan.\n\n\"It's a pseudo royal visit, mimicking many of the things they or William and Kate would have done when they were part of the Firm, but it seems to be lacking in the ceremonial side of things,\" the source said, per the Daily Mail.\n\nJordan's King, King Abdullah II, maintains longstanding ties with the British Royal Family.\n\nHe has shared warm public moments with King Charles III, including during an official visit to London last year. Abdullah and Queen Rania were prominent guests at the British coronation, where Queen Rania also met with Queen Camilla to discuss issues affecting women.\n\nThe Jordanian heir, Crown Prince Hussein, is also known to have a friendly rapport with Prince William.\n\nThe two have spent time together both in Jordan and the UK, including attending a World Cup match and carrying out a joint visit to RAF Benson. William and Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, were also guests at Hussein's 2023 wedding.\n\nWhile the Sussexes were not received by Jordan's senior royals, they were greeted by British diplomatic staff upon arrival.\n\nThat involvement has drawn criticism from former Conservative minister Tim Loughton, who questioned the appropriateness of hosting the couple at the British Ambassador's official residence.\n\nLoughton said he found it surprising that Ambassador Philip Hall had extended such a formal reception, particularly given the Duke and Duchess's decision to step back from royal duties and present themselves as private citizens.\n\nHall reportedly expressed his appreciation for their visit during a roundtable event that included representatives from the United Nations and the World Health Organization.\n\n\"Your visit, your support, your appreciation of the efforts that the United Nations, including, of course, the World Health Organization, the government of Jordan, and others, are making here is enormously appreciated,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, Loughton explained that Harry and Meghan \"are not working royals and do not represent the British Government or UK PLC.\"\n\nHe added, \"Given their capacity to say unhelpful things which border on political, giving them an official platform could be construed as them saying something that represents official UK policy.\"\n\nBeyond the diplomatic discussions, Harry and Meghan focused their visit on humanitarian outreach.\n\nAt the invitation of Dr. Tedros, they met health officials and aid partners before travelling north to Za'atari Refugee Camp, one of the region's largest settlements for displaced families.\n\nThere, they toured a youth centre run by Questscope, which provides art, music, and sports programmes aimed at supporting young people's wellbeing.\n\nThe couple joined children in a football match, observed music sessions featuring traditional Arabic instruments, and met teenagers taking part in creative workshops designed to offer both education and psychosocial support.\n\nTheir programme also includes meetings with health and humanitarian teams coordinating relief efforts across the region.",

    "description": "\"It was very dark and murky.\"",
    "fullText": "Officials in South Texas have raised concerns after discovering that Tesla has been discharging treated wastewater from its lithium refinery into a local drainage ditch without notifying the district that maintains it.\n\nAccording to KRIS 6 News, Tesla holds a state-issued permit allowing it to discharge up to 231,000 gallons of treated wastewater per day into an unnamed ditch that eventually flows into Petronila Creek.\n\nBut drainage district officials said they were never notified that a pipeline had been installed across their easement. When workers encountered the discharge, they were alarmed by what they saw.\n\n\"It was very dark and murky,\" drainage district consultant Steve Ray said. \"I would say it was actually black. We're used to seeing good running water, and so we didn't know exactly what it was.\"\n\nThe lithium refinery, which began operations in December 2024, produces battery-grade lithium for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nWhile Tesla's permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality allows wastewater discharge, it specifically notes that it does not grant the right to use private or public property for conveyance.\n\nPetronila Creek flows into Baffin Bay, a sensitive coastal ecosystem that supports tourism and local livelihoods.\n\nIf large volumes of water — even treated water — were to overwhelm the ditch or carry unexpected pollutants downstream, it could threaten water quality and wildlife.\n\nBeyond environmental questions, this situation may raise concerns for customers. Tesla has previously faced scrutiny over product reliability and transparency.\n\nFor example, a class action lawsuit alleged that electronically actuated door handles on certain 2014-16 Model S vehicles \"routinely fail,\" leaving some owners unable to enter their cars without climbing through another door.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla sales in the United Kingdom dropped more than 57% year over year in January as competitors gained ground.\n\nWhile the company has helped accelerate the shift to electric vehicles, public trust plays a key role in continued growth.\n\nDrainage district officials said Tesla has been responsive since concerns were raised, and both parties are scheduled to meet to coordinate next steps.\n\nFor residents, staying informed about local water management meetings and environmental oversight can help ensure transparency.\n\nFor drivers considering an electric vehicle, it's worth remembering that the broader EV market includes many options beyond one brand.\n\nAs the drainage district works to clarify what's flowing through its ditches, officials say their focus is simple: protecting the community and the waterways that support it.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "AI is still leading the BBC Sport predictions table, but could Albert Einstein be the unlikely inspiration to help Chris Sutton hit back this week?\n\n\"Einstein used to live in a hut across the field from my house,\" said BBC Sport football expert Sutton. \"He would have gone for a walk in my garden, I'm sure, so I'm literally following in his footsteps most days.\n\n\"I don't know what he was like at predicting football results, but that kind of genius rubs off, even years later.\n\n\"So, AI should beware - for this week's predictions I've been gazing at where his hut used to be and thinking 'what would Albert do?'\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 28 is Oli Fox from indie band Good Neighbours, who supports West Ham.\n\nAn expanded version of Good Neighbours' debut album, Blue Sky Mentality (Complete Edition), is out now.\n\nDo you agree with their predictions? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nOli is the younger brother of Wigan's former Wales Under-21s defender Morgan Fox, and his early dreams were to follow him into the professional game.\n\nHe told BBC Sport: \"I played a bit myself growing up, and had trials here and there, but I was never as close as my brother to being a pro - so I sacked it off pretty quickly.\n\n\"I don't think I'll get away with saying I was better than him. Morgan always had the natural ability when we were kids, even at the age of four or five, and he was scouted by Ipswich by the age of seven.\n\n\"Our dad's Welsh so he was very proud when Morgan played for their under-21s. He got called up for the senior team as well, against Turkey, which was awesome. That was a fun away day.\n\n\"It's been awesome going to watch him down the years - even when I am away on tour I get a link to tune in wherever I am in the world. I've not really missed a game, visually anyway.\n\n\"It's been harder for him to come and watch me, but we had our first UK tour in more than a year the other week, and he came to see me in Manchester. That was brilliant too.\"\n\nThe pair have both featured in the past two editions of best-selling video game EA FC - Good Neighbours songs are on the soundtrack of EA FC 25 and 26, while Morgan is in both as a player.\n\n\"We grew up playing it, so that was really cool,\" Oli added.\n\nChris Sutton and Oli Fox were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nI keep hearing people say that, mathematically, Wolves still have a chance of staying up, but let me just tell them straight - there is no chance of that happening.\n\nThere is no doubt Wolves have improved under Rob Edwards, but this is still a game I'd expect Aston Villa to win.\n\nUnai Emery's side have slipped up a few times in recent weeks, however, and it has cost them.\n\nThey have only won one of their past four league games and I am a bit gutted they haven't managed a couple more wins to really be in the title race.\n\nEmery has always talked down their title hopes anyhow, and I understand why - he obviously doesn't truly believe they can do it - but until this blip in form they were in with a real shout.\n\nI still think they will have too much for Wolves, but they are going to have to work hard for the points. Villa won 1-0 at Villa Park earlier in the season, so I am going for the same scoreline here.\n\nOli's prediction: I don't think either team is in particularly fine form. Wolves don't have much to play for but they have got a few young players in the team now who are really good, and they can get a result here. 1-1\n\nSunderland just seem to be fading a little bit.\n\nThey went fourth in the table when they beat Bournemouth 3-2 at the Stadium of Light at the end of November, but their results have tailed off recently and they have missed Granit Xhaka's influence in recent weeks.\n\nXhaka came off the bench in last week's defeat by Fulham and, if he starts this time, they will be better organised here.\n\nI still fancy Bournemouth to win it, though. They always create chances and Rayan has done well since signing in January to replace Antoine Semenyo.\n\nOli's prediction: Bournemouth's front three is frightening and West Ham did well to keep them out last week. Sunderland don't really have the legs in midfield to cope. 3-1\n\nBurnley are still competitive, still scrapping and still picking up points. Their players are still playing for Scott Parker but, even so, it's still not going to be enough to keep them up.\n\nThe Clarets' draw at Chelsea last week was a good result and they could even have won that game, too, but they didn't. That lack of wins has been their problem all season, not their performances.\n\nThey have only won four of their 27 games so far and I think they are going to need to win five of their final 11 to stay up from here - and that's not going to happen.\n\nI don't think anyone saw Brentford's home defeat by Brighton coming last week - I didn't anyway - but I am still going to back them at Turf Moor.\n\nIt's going to be another tight one but I can see Igor Thiago getting back on the scoresheet with the winner. That's as exact as predictions can get.\n\nOli's prediction: I always kind of fancy Burnley to get something at home. Zian Flemming is in good form for them too. 2-2\n\nI keep hearing how West Ham have turned a corner, and they have improved recently, but I still thought last week's draw at home to Bournemouth was a poor result.\n\nThe Hammers were helped by Nottingham Forest and Tottenham both being beaten, but a win would have been massive for them.\n\nLiverpool were very unconvincing at Forest, but they did nick the win.\n\nSome of their fans are still whinging about Arne Slot and he is always being compared to Jurgen Klopp, but they are actually on a decent run of results and showing a bit of spirit too.\n\nThey are right in the mix for the top four but now they need to keep winning - I expect them to do that on Saturday.\n\nOli on why he's a West Ham fan: All my family are from East Ham and Upton Park. They grew up watching them, so when I was a kid I didn't really have a choice. I wouldn't have it any other way, though - I love them to bits.\n\nOli's prediction: The sensible prediction here is that Liverpool will win but I am not going with that. Instead, we will score inside the first 10 minutes because we always start well, but they will come back and then we will be fighting for an equaliser. I am not too hopeful, but I am going to say we will get one. 2-2\n\nWill West Ham stay up? The end of last season and the beginning of this one have probably been the toughest times to be a West Ham fan, because of what was happening at the club from the top down - it kind of felt like a wasted effort to try and support them.\n\nBut I feel like good things are on the horizon for us now - it feels like there is more camaraderie within the team, and they are starting to get Nuno Espirito Santo's methods more. Axel Disasi coming in has been game-changing too, when I didn't think he would have that effect.\n\nWe've found another gear now and obviously Crysencio Summerville's form has been excellent with Mateus Fernandes, but Tomas Soucek has been really key as well. I am feeling optimistic, because we've got a bit of grit.\n\nEverton's inconsistency makes them an absolute nightmare to predict, and the fact their away form is much better than their home results doesn't help me much here either.\n\nAnthony Gordon looks sharp as anything up front for Newcastle, with Nick Woltemade playing just in behind.\n\nThe Magpies won 4-1 at Hill Dickinson Stadium in November and I'd usually back them in this kind of game at St James' Park and be quite confident they would win.\n\nBut Everton won here last season and, given how good they are on the road, I just have a sneaky feeling they will get something this time too.\n\nOli's prediction: Everton had a few good chances against Manchester United but they just don't have that end product. Newcastle are at home so I've got to go with them. 2-0\n\nThis will be a great game. I was at Etihad Stadium when these two teams met in November, and it was a real turning point in Leeds' season.\n\nCity were 2-0 up at half-time but Leeds boss Daniel Farke put Dominic Calvert-Lewin on and had a real go.\n\nThey fought back to 2-2, and although they still lost to a last-gasp Phil Foden goal, that performance transformed them - they've been a different team in recent weeks compared with the way they started the season.\n\nThis is the sort of game where, if you are a City fan, you are thinking we have to go to Elland Road and win if we are going to win the title.\n\nLeaders Arsenal did exactly that a few weeks ago, and blew Leeds away.\n\nCan City do the same? I am not sure - especially if we class this Saturday evening kick-off as a night game, because Leeds' record in those under Farke is extraordinary - out of 21 so far, they have won 18 and drawn three.\n\nIt's hard to call, so this was one of the games I mentioned earlier where I was thinking, 'What would Einstein say?'.\n\nHe was better at physics than he was at predictions but I reckon he would have calculated that the floodlights will inspire Leeds again - but City will still come out on top.\n\nSo, my theory is that City will win. They don't have the same control in midfield any more, but they have so much firepower - as well as Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush and Semenyo are both in good form.\n\nHaaland is not exactly playing a different role now, but he is showing what an intelligent footballer he is. I don't see Leeds keeping them out.\n\nOli's prediction: This should be a simple game for City, but Leeds at home is never straightforward. Elland Road is like a fortress and Leeds have got goals in them so I can see this being a bit of a scrap. 2-3\n\nBrighton badly needed last week's win over Brentford, just to settle things down under Fabian Hurzeler. There had been a lot of talk about his future while they were on a poor run.\n\nNottingham Forest did not deserve to lose against Liverpool last week but scoring goals is still a problem for them, and I feel like it could haunt them again here.\n\nOli's prediction: I obviously hope Forest lose from a West Ham point of view but I'd take a draw here because you never know what you will get from Brighton. 1-1\n\nThe Tudor times have not started well for Tottenham under Igor Tudor.\n\nIt's been a classic case of a manager coming in and being bullish in his first press conference, saying he is 100% sure they will stay up - then losing his first game and letting loose on the previous manager, saying things like the players aren't fit.\n\nI thought it was an astonishing attack on Thomas Frank, because by saying Spurs' players are \"a good group with bad habits\", Tudor is totally blaming him for everything.\n\nWe know Tudor is a short-term specialist but what does that actually mean about him as a manager? It is OK going in and shoring clubs up for a few games, but why does he keep losing his job after that?\n\nI don't think this is an easy game for him after his side were outclassed in the north London derby.\n\nFulham won well at Sunderland last time out and they look full of confidence. Their home record is good and they've already beaten Spurs once this season - there's a good chance they will beat them again.\n\nOli's prediction: Fulham will take this, 100%. That would be great if it happens. 3-1\n\nManchester United have been very good under Michael Carrick and they are a team full of confidence - the way Benjamin Sesko is playing when he comes on is a great example of that.\n\nPalace picked up a late win over Wolves last time out but it still feels like their manager Oliver Glasner should have left by now, because there is such a negative atmosphere around the whole club.\n\nI don't like to question anyone's commitment but, in this scenario, I think you have no choice. Glasner wants to leave, and the whole situation has been handled very badly.\n\nPalace have won away at Manchester United in the past two seasons but, the way things are going for both teams, you'd only ever go for a home win here.\n\nOli's prediction: The way United are playing, I can see them scoring a few. 3-0\n\nArsenal have got to be careful they don't warm up in the Chelsea half again, for starters. If I was playing in this game, I'd do it deliberately!\n\nIn terms of the game, I can't see anything other than a Gunners win.\n\nChelsea can cause Arsenal a few problems because they have got players who can hurt anyone but, at the other end, I don't see Liam Rosenior's side keeping a clean sheet.\n\nI liked the way Arsenal responded to their setback against Wolves by battering Spurs. Chelsea don't like them much either, but this is going to end up with the same result.\n\nOli's prediction: Off the top of my head I want to say 2-2 for this one, it just feels right - we are going to see a few goals. 2-2\n\nOli on Declan Rice: I loved watching Kaka in the Champions League when I was a kid and I always wanted to play like him. But being able to watch Rice from when he broke into West Ham's first team was incredible.\n\nI understood he had to leave to reach the heights he has done and even the way he went to Arsenal, he did it really well. He's up there with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard as one of the greatest all-round English midfielders, and to watch that as a West Ham fan, I am just so proud of him.\n\nThe outcome of week 27 went down to the final game, Manchester United's 2-1 win at Everton on Monday.\n\nChris wrongly predicted a 1-1 draw but his guest, Embrace bassist Steve Firth, correctly backed United to win 1-0 - and those 10 points handed him the weekly win.\n\nOverall, Chris got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, including one exact score, for a total of 80 points.\n\nThat was enough for him to beat the BBC readers, who got five correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 50 points, and also get the better of AI, which managed six correct results with no exact scores for 60 points.\n\nBut it was Firth who finished on top, with six correct results and one exact score, to end up on 90 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "In the future, Savannah fans of Buc-ee's will have a much shorter drive as the iconic chain plans a new store much closer than the Brunswick location.",
    "fullText": "Buc-ee's continues its expansion, with what will be the chain's fourth Georgia location in Monroe County. As of last fall, it's supposed to be complete by March 2027. But there's another fans in the south will want to keep an eye out for.\n\nA new Buc-ee's is planned for Hardeeville in Jasper County, about 25 minutes up I-95 from the Savannah area. It will occupy a 46-acre site within the larger Hardee Station development located at Exit 8 off I-95, at the intersection of U.S. Highway 278 and Highway 17.\n\nOnce completed, this would put it just 20-30 miles outside of the Savannah area, depending on where specifically you live. Currently, the nearest is in Brunswick, over 60 miles away.\n\nThe Hardeeville Buc-ee's location in Jasper County is expected to include dozens of fuel pumps and electric-vehicle charging stations, serving both traditional and eco-friendly travelers. Key features include a bicycle plaza and several scenic ponds that enhance the visitor experience, according to multiple media reports.\n\nConstruction on the new Buc-ee’s in Hardeeville is expected to begin in early 2026. Josh Gruber, Hardeeville city manager, said the town's goal is to meet residents' needs.\n\n\"Basically, what that means is, for a resident to be able to go to the grocery store, go out to eat, have retail recreation opportunities, can get all of those needs met, and do that within the city of Hardeeville, rather than having them have to get in a car and drive someplace else outside the city,\" Gruber said in an interview with media outlet WJCL.\n\nThe projected completion date is 2031, according to Buc-ee's.\n\nThe following Buc-ee's locations are set to open in 2026, according to USA TODAY.\n\nHuber Heights, Ohio, on April 6\n\nBenton, Arkansas, in late summer or early fall\n\nMurfreesboro, Tennessee, before the end of 2026\n\nThere are currently three open Georgia Buc-ee's in Brunswick, Calhoun, and Warner Robins. South Carolina has one in Florence.\n\nPay rates at Buc-ee's depend on the position. But cashiers, grocery associates, gift associates, and janitorial/cleaning and maintenance attendants all make $18.\n\nMeanwhile, deli/food service associates, bookkeepers, and grocery team leads make $21.

    "title": "Remote employees have quietly unlocked one major workplace perk: Getting paid 12% more than their in-office colleagues, Fed study finds",
    "description": "The biggest remote-work winners in France are already high-paid senior employees able to persuade their bosses to let them stay home, new research reveals.",
    "fullText": "At the end of last year, a Harvard University–led study revealed the lengths to which remote employees would go to continue working from the comfort of their home offices: Participants were, on average, willing to forgo 25% of their total compensation in order to have their identical job, except with partial or full remote work capabilities, instead of working in the office.\n\nWhat does research reveal about remote work's future?\n\nWhy do remote workers earn higher wages than office employees?\n\nWhat demographic factors explain the work-from-home wage premium?\n\nHow does employee seniority affect remote work opportunities?\n\nNew research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco suggests the opposite phenomenon is happening—at least for some workers. Employees working from home are actually getting paid more than their in-office colleagues.\n\nA recent study published by the San Francisco Fed analyzed data from nearly 25,000 French employees using the French Labor Force Survey, as well as firm-level data, and Social Security records to look at which jobs had flexible options, what they paid, as well as demographic information about the workers.\n\nResearchers found employees who work from home, at least some of the time, earned, on average, 12% higher hourly rates than those working fully in-person. About half of this boost was correlated with education levels, gender, and age, and when researchers controlled for these variables, they still saw about a 6% difference in wages, with remote employees still earning what researchers call a work-from-home wage premium.\n\nThe study noted both France and the U.S. have similar levels of employees working from home, and both countries have more remote work opportunities for higher-paying, better-educated employees.\n\n“Using French administrative data and controlling for a rich set of worker and firm characteristics, we find that workers who work from home earn higher hourly wages than those who do not,” researchers said.\n\nEven with the pandemic nearly six years in the rearview mirror, work-from-home debates have continued as large companies—including Stellantis and Home Depot just in the past month—asked workers to come back to the office five days a week. Nearly 65% of workers said their offices have some form of hybrid work, according to data from Zoom.\n\nThe trend of workplace flexibility appears to be here to stay: The National Bureau of Economic Research found millennials and Gen Z bosses are more likely to let employees work from home compared with bosses from older generations, creating an even greater imperative for future-of-work experts to better understand what makes it so compelling in an evolving workforce.\n\nTo be sure, remote employees are not magically getting paid more just because they clock in from home. The San Francisco Fed study noted nearly half of the 12% pay bump for hybrid workers was the result of certain demographic factors, such as age, gender, and how long someone has held their job position. Older workers with more senior titles, for example, were paid more.",

    "title": "The costliest error people make in their 60s has nothing to do with money—it’s overlooking these 11 warning signs",
    "description": "What you wave off now as normal will cost you everything in ten years.",
    "fullText": "I was sitting across from a man in his early sixties who kept talking about his retirement portfolio like it was the only thing holding his life together.\n\nWe were at a small dinner party. The kind where the wine is cheap but the conversations turn unexpectedly honest.\n\nHe listed percentages. Market shifts. Safe bets. He said the word “security” at least six times.\n\nBut when someone asked how he’d been sleeping, he laughed it off. Said he was “fine.”\n\nLater, when everyone else had drifted toward the dessert table, he admitted he hadn’t slept through the night in months. His chest felt tight in the mornings. He’d stopped calling old friends back. “It’s just stress,” he said. “It’ll pass.”\n\nIt didn’t look like stress. It looked like something deeper.\n\nThat was the first time I realized how many people in their 60s obsess over protecting their money. But the costliest error has nothing to do with finances. It’s overlooking these warning signs. Here’s what’s actually going on.\n\nThey used to wake up with energy. Now they wake up tired and assume it’s inevitable.\n\nSo they normalize it. They say, “Well, I’m not 30 anymore.” They shrug it off when their body feels heavier than it should.\n\nThey push through afternoons that feel foggy and slow.\n\nOf course, aging changes things. But there’s a difference between natural slowing and chronic depletion. Persistent fatigue in later adulthood often links back to untreated sleep disorders, depression, or underlying medical issues—not “just getting older.”\n\nWhen someone decides exhaustion is the price of turning 60, they stop investigating it. And sometimes what they’re dismissing is exactly what needs attention.\n\nIt doesn’t happen in an obvious way\n\nThey stop initiating plans. They cancel more often. They tell themselves they’re “just tired” or that everyone’s busy anyway. Over time, the invitations slow down.\n\nThis happened with my aunt. She used to host every single Easter, and then one day, just convinced herself that she was done. The effort wasn't worth it.\n\nBut long-term studies on aging and well-being consistently show that social connection is one of the strongest predictors of both mental and physical health in later life. Isolation doesn’t just feel lonely—it compounds stress and shortens resilience.\n\nPulling back may feel protective. It rarely is.\n\nForgetting where the keys are is normal. Forgetting familiar routes or repeating the same story multiple times in one evening can be different.\n\nMany people in their 60s were raised to power through discomfort. Admitting cognitive changes feels like admitting weakness. So they joke about it instead.\n\n“Senior moment,” they say, brushing it off.\n\nNeurologists often point out that early intervention matters far more than late-stage panic. Mild cognitive impairment, when caught early, can sometimes be slowed or managed. But that requires acknowledging it in the first place.\n\nPretending nothing is happening doesn’t stop it from happening.\n\nThe circle gets smaller. The routine tighter. The risks fewer.\n\nThey stop trying new restaurants. Stop traveling. Stop learning new technology because it feels frustrating. They tell themselves they’ve “done enough.”\n\nThere’s comfort in familiarity. But there’s also stagnation.\n\nLearning new skills, navigating new environments, even small changes in routine can help maintain cognitive flexibility.\n\nWhen someone’s world quietly narrows to the couch, the TV, and the same weekly errands, it doesn’t just limit experiences. It limits growth.\n\nI didn’t see this clearly until I watched a relative slowly stop doing the things that once animated him. It wasn’t age that dulled him. It was retreat.\n\nA sore knee becomes a permanent companion. Back pain becomes background noise. Instead of asking questions, they adapt around it.\n\nThey stop walking as far. Stop exercising altogether. Stop mentioning it at checkups because “it’s not that bad.”\n\nHere’s what often gets missed: untreated chronic pain doesn’t just affect mobility. It affects mood, sleep, and overall health. There’s a strong connection between persistent pain and increased risk of depression in older adults.\n\nPain that lingers is information. Ignoring it doesn’t make someone tough. It just delays relief.\n\n“Everyone slows down.” “Of course I’m not as excited about things.” “This is what 60 looks like.”\n\nSometimes it is. Sometimes it isn’t.\n\nDepression in older adults often looks different from how it looks in younger people. It can show up as irritability, loss of interest, sleep disruption, or unexplained physical complaints. And it’s frequently underdiagnosed because it hides behind the narrative of aging.\n\nMental health professionals have long noted that many people over 60 don’t label what they’re feeling as depression—they call it boredom, stress, or fatigue.\n\nIf joy has quietly drained from daily life and nothing feels particularly worth looking forward to, that’s not something to dismiss.\n\nThere’s a certain silence that creeps in during this decade.\n\nFear of illness. Fear of becoming dependent. Fear of irrelevance. Fear of running out of time.\n\nInstead of naming it, they focus on spreadsheets or house projects or reorganizing the garage. Anything measurable feels safer than admitting vulnerability.\n\nSaying the fear out loud can help it lose some of its grip. But many 60-year-olds never do. They carry it privately, which makes it heavier.\n\nAvoidance doesn’t eliminate fear. It just isolates it.\n\n“This year’s not the right year.”\n\n“After I hit this savings goal.”\n\nThe plans stay theoretical. The trips remain bookmarked online. The hobbies wait for some undefined future window.\n\nAs people age, they become more aware of time’s limits, yet paradoxically, some still delay meaningful action. It’s a strange human contradiction.\n\nI’ve caught myself doing this in smaller ways—waiting for a perfect moment that never actually arrives. In your 60s, that waiting becomes more consequential.\n\nMoney can grow. Markets can recover.\n\nBut overlooking the signals your body, mind, and relationships are sending you? That’s a different kind of loss.\n\nThe costliest mistake in this decade isn’t financial miscalculation. It’s assuming you have unlimited time to address what’s quietly asking for your attention.\n\nLong marriages grow quieter. Friendships shift. Adult children get busy.\n\nInstead of examining what feels off, they tell themselves this is simply what long-term relationships become.\n\nLess affectionate. Less curious. Less engaged.\n\nThey stop asking questions they once would have asked. They stop reaching across emotional distance because it feels awkward to start again.\n\nBut emotional drift is not inevitable.\n\nWhen resentment goes unspoken or loneliness inside a partnership is brushed aside, it hardens. What could have been a conversation becomes a permanent gap. Over time, people begin living beside each other instead of with each other.\n\nIt’s a subtle cost. Shared meals without connection. Evenings spent in separate rooms. A quiet sense of being unseen that grows heavier each year.\n\nAssuming “this is just marriage at our age” can prevent people from repairing what is still repairable.\n\nRetirement arrives. Careers wind down. The role that once structured their days disappears.\n\nAt first, the freedom feels earned. There’s relief in not answering to anyone. But after the novelty fades, something else can settle in—a question they don’t quite want to ask: *Who am I now?*\n\nRather than naming that emptiness, they fill the calendar with errands. They stay busy without feeling engaged. They tell themselves they should be grateful, so they push away the discomfort.\n\nPurpose doesn’t vanish with a paycheck. But it does need to be redefined.\n\nWhen people ignore that internal shift, they can start feeling invisible to themselves. Days blur together. Motivation dips. Small frustrations feel outsized because there’s nothing anchoring them.\n\nPurpose in this decade may look different—mentoring, volunteering, creating, learning—but pretending it doesn’t matter is often more damaging than financial missteps. A well-funded life without meaning still feels hollow.\n\nThere’s a particular confidence that can set in during the 60s. If nothing hurts sharply and nothing feels urgent, they assume everything is stable.\n\nMy father kept postponing a routine checkup because he felt perfectly healthy. He walked every morning. Ate reasonably well. “Why go looking for trouble?” he’d say. By the time he finally went in, what could have been simple had become complicated.\n\nThat’s how it happens. Appointments get postponed. Screenings are delayed. Follow-ups feel optional. It’s easier not to go searching for problems.\n\nBut many serious conditions develop quietly. High blood pressure doesn’t announce itself loudly. Early-stage illness often whispers before it shouts.\n\nThe danger isn’t overt neglect. It’s the slow habit of postponing attention.\n\nPreventive care isn’t about expecting the worst. It’s about respecting the body enough to check in with it. Feeling fine in the moment doesn’t always mean everything underneath is fine.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — The U.S. State Department said Thursday that it would pay up to $10 million for information leading to the arrests or convictions of two brothers identified as leaders of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel in the state of Baja California, which includes Tijuana.\n\nThe reward offer came the same day that authorities announced a new indictment against Rene Arzate Garcia, 42, known as “La Rana\" (\"The Frog\"). He was initially charged with drug crimes in San Diego. The superseding indictment includes charges of conspiracy, narcoterrorism and material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThe U. S. is offering $5 million each for information on Rene Arzate Garcia and Alfonso Arzate Garcia, 52, known as “Aquiles” (\"Achilles\"). Their whereabouts are unknown.\n\n“As controllers of a critical trafficking node in Tijuana at the U.S. border, the Arzate-Garcia brothers have become key essential components of the cartel’s command-and-control structure,” the State Department said. “Their control of the Tijuana Plaza offers the Sinaloa Cartel a tactical advantage in maintaining dominance over rival organizations, ensuring no interruption to the busiest border crossing in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nCalifornia's border with Mexico has been a battleground between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels.\n\nThe rewards were announced four days after the Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, “El Mencho,” decapitating what had become Mexico’s most powerful cartel. The drug lord was the Mexican government’s biggest prize yet to show the Trump administration in its efforts to crack down on the cartels.",

    "fullText": "Texas Game Wardens have a warning for anyone using who goes out on lakes and rivers around the state. Failing to properly clean boats and equipment can spread invasive species -- and lead to citations.\n\nThat's because not cleaning can lead to the spread of invasive plants.\n\nAccording to Texas Game Wardens, certain invasive plants can cover lakes, block sunlight and oxygen, and destroy aquatic life below the surface. Officials say the species can spread quickly when boaters don’t properly clean, drain and dry their boats and gear after visiting an infested waterbody.\n\nThe warning comes after game wardens say they cited a duck hunter recently on Bois d’Arc Lake after an invasive plant was attached to his trailer. Officials say the hunter had previously launched a boat on an infected lake and, as a result, brought the giant salvinia and water hyacinth to Bois d’Arc Lake.\n\nMembers of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Inland Fisheries Department spent time on the lake collecting the invasive plants to try to prevent them from becoming established.\n\nOfficials say these invasive species can grow quickly under ideal conditions. One acre of giant salvinia can double to two acres in just a single week, Texas Game Wardens say.\n\nAccording to Texas Parks and Wildlife, giant salvinia is a floating fern native to southern Brazil and one of the problematic plants in Texas.  TPWD says it damages aquatic ecosystems by outgrowing and replacing plants that are native to Texas that help the environment.  You can read more about giant salvinia here. Water hyacinth are native to South American and can form dense colonies in bodies of water that block sunlight and can also crowd out native species.\n\nGot a news tip or story idea?

    "fullText": "Instagram said Thursday it will start alerting parents if their kids repeatedly search for terms clearly associated with suicide or self-harm. The alerts will only go to parents who are enrolled in Instagram’s parental supervision program.\n\nInstagram says it already blocks such content from showing up in teen accounts’ search results and directs people to helplines instead.\n\nThe announcement comes as Meta is in the midst of two trials over harms to children. A trial underway in Los Angeles questions whether Meta’s platforms deliberately addict and harm minors. Another, in New Mexico, seeks to determine whether Meta failed to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its platforms. Thousands of families — along with school districts and government entities — have sued Meta and other social media companies claiming they deliberately design their platforms to be addictive and fail to protect kids from content that can lead to depression, eating disorders and suicide.\n\nMeta executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg have disputed that the platforms cause addiction. During questioning by the plaintiff’s lawyer, in Los Angeles, Zuckerberg said he still agrees with a previous statement he made that the existing body of scientific work has not proved that social media causes mental health harms.\n\nThe alerts will be sent via email, text or WhatsApp, depending on the parent's contact information available, as well as a notification through the parent's Instagram account.\n\n“Our goal is to empower parents to step in if their teen’s searches suggest they may need support. We also want to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, which, if done too much, could make the notifications less useful overall,” Meta said in a blog post.\n\nJosh Golin, executive director of the nonprofit Fairplay, was skeptical of the new tool, saying Instagram “is clearly making this move now because the company is currently on trial in two different states for addicting and harming kids.”\n\n“Once again, Meta is shifting the burden to parents rather than fixing the dangerous flaws in how it designs its algorithms and platforms,” Golin said. “And all children deserve to be protected, regardless of whether their parents have enrolled in and utilize Meta’s supervision tools. If a product is not safe for teens to use without parental intervention, it shouldn’t be marketed to teens at all.”\n\nMeta said it is also working on similar notifications to parents about their kids' interactions with artificial intelligence.\n\n“These will notify parents if a teen attempts to engage in certain types of conversations related to suicide or self-harm with our AI,” Meta said. “This is important work and we’ll have more to share in the coming months.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Humans and Neanderthals cozied up from time to time when they lived in the same areas tens of thousands of years ago. But we don't know much about who got with whom, or why.\n\nA new genetic analysis offers some ancient gossip: The pairings were more often female humans with male Neanderthals.\n\nHow exactly this happened remains a huge question mark. Did human women venture into Neanderthal populations, or were the Neanderthal males drawn to larger human enclaves? Were these interactions peaceful, confusing, secretive or even violent?\n\n“I don’t know if we’ll ever get a definitive answer to how this happened, since we can’t travel back in time,” said population genetics expert Xinjun Zhang with the University of Michigan, commenting on the new analysis.\n\nBut the study, published Thursday in the journal Science, shows “that whenever Neanderthals and modern humans have mated, there has been a preference for male Neanderthals and female modern humans, as opposed to the other way around,” said author Alexander Platt, who studies genetics at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nScientists know that Neanderthals and humans mated because there is a small but important percentage of Neanderthal DNA in most modern humans outside of sub-Saharan Africa — including genes that can help us fight some diseases and make us more susceptible to others.\n\nBut they have also known that the Neanderthal DNA is not distributed evenly throughout the human genome.\n\nIn particular, there is a surprising lack of Neanderthal DNA in the human X chromosome, one of the bundles of genes in each cell known as a sex chromosome, compared with the amount of Neanderthal DNA in the other, non-sex chromosomes in the cell.\n\nScientists thought that maybe the genes in those locations were simply not beneficial — or even harmful. Perhaps people with those gene patterns didn’t survive as well so those genes were filtered out by evolution over time.\n\nOr, they thought, maybe the difference could be explained by how the two species intermingled.\n\nTo try to solve the riddle, Platt and colleagues looked instead at the Neanderthal genome and the human DNA that got interspersed during a “mating event” 250,000 years ago.\n\nWhen comparing these genes, they found more of a human fingerprint on the Neanderthal X chromosome — the same chromosome that, in humans, has less Neanderthal DNA than would be expected.\n\nThe most likely explanation for this mirror image pattern is mating behavior. That's because of the way sex chromosomes are passed from parents to children, explained Platt. Because genetic females have two X chromosomes and genetic males have one X and one Y chromosomes, two out of every three X chromosomes in a population, on average, are inherited from people’s mothers.\n\nIf more human females mated with Neanderthal males than the other way around, over thousands of years you would expect to see just what they found: more human DNA in Neanderthal X chromosomes and less Neanderthal DNA in human X chromosomes.\n\n“I think that they’ve taken some really important steps in filling missing pieces to the puzzle,” said Joshua Akey, who studies evolutionary genomics at Princeton University and wasn't involved with the new study.\n\nThe study can't totally rule out other explanations. For example, Zhang said, it’s possible that the offspring of human males and Neanderthal females just didn’t survive as well.\n\nBut the simplest and most likely, explanation, the study found, is also the most interesting: “It’s not the result of a strictly Darwinian survival of the fittest,” Platt said. “It’s really the result of how we interact with each other, and what our culture and society and behavior is like.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Parking lots are designed for quick stops. Drivers pull in, grab groceries, load their trunks and head back on the road. But police are warning that the same spaces where motorists park their vehicles have quietly become a hunting ground for a new and aggressive scam.\n\nAuthorities in Charleston say criminals are targeting shoppers in grocery store parking lots with a deceptive scheme that can drain thousands of dollars from a victim’s bank account in seconds. The scam relies on pressure, sympathy and a portable payment device that turns what appears to be a small donation into a major financial loss.\n\nAccording to investigators, the suspects usually work in small groups and wait for drivers to return to their vehicles after shopping.\n\nAs motorists load groceries into their trunks or prepare to leave the parking lot, the group approaches and begins a conversation that often starts with a heartbreaking story.\n\nVictims report being told that the scammers are collecting donations for a funeral, a medical emergency, or another urgent cause. The story is designed to create emotional pressure. Shoppers are made to feel they are helping someone in distress and that even a small amount of money could make a difference.\n\nBut the scam quickly takes a different turn.\n\nWhen a person offers cash, the suspects decline and claim they can only accept digital payments. They then present a handheld card reader and ask the victim to tap their debit or credit card for what appears to be a quick donation. In reality, the amount being processed may be far higher than expected.\n\nPolice say some victims have reported losing thousands of dollars in a single transaction. In certain cases, losses have approached ten thousand dollars before the victim realizes what happened.\n\nInvestigators believe the scammers rely heavily on speed and confusion. Parking lots are busy environments where drivers are distracted by traffic, shopping carts and children. Criminals take advantage of those distractions to pressure victims into making a fast decision without carefully reviewing the payment.\n\nThe choice of location is also strategic. Grocery store parking areas are filled with vehicles coming and going throughout the day, which allows scammers to blend into the crowd. They can quickly move on to another shopper or leave the lot if anyone becomes suspicious.\n\nPolice say certain drivers appear to be targeted more often than others. Young mothers with children in shopping carts are frequently approached because scammers believe emotional appeals may be more effective in those situations. Victims sometimes feel pressured to comply simply to end the encounter and leave the area safely.\n\nThis story piqued our interest for several reasons, including the fact that the scam spotlights an often-overlooked aspect of automotive safety. Most people focus on avoiding theft or vehicle break ins while parked, but personal financial scams are increasingly becoming part of the risk landscape around busy parking areas.\n\nLaw enforcement officials recommend that motorists treat any unsolicited request for money in a parking lot with caution. Legitimate charities rarely collect donations in this manner, especially through handheld card readers operated by strangers.\n\nDrivers are encouraged to keep interactions brief, decline requests politely and leave the area if they feel pressured or uncomfortable. If suspicious activity is observed, police recommend reporting it so officers can investigate and warn other shoppers.\n\nIn today’s digital payment era, criminals are finding new ways to exploit convenience technology. A simple tap of a card that takes less than a second can authorize a large transaction, making it easier than ever for scammers to strike quickly.\n\nMotorists heading to the grocery store should keep in mind that the parking lot is not just where your trip begins and ends. It is also a place where awareness and caution can protect both your car and your wallet.\n\nNote: This article contains embedded video. Embedded media may not display on all platforms.

    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The chief federal judge for Minnesota issued a stern warning Thursday to the chief federal prosecutor for the state, as well as to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, warning them that they must comply with court orders or they risk criminal contempt charges.\n\nChief Judge Patrick Schiltz, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush and is seen as a conservative, took issue with an email he received Feb. 9 from U.S. Attorney Daniel Rosen, in which the prosecutor accused the judge of overstating the extent of ICE's noncompliance with court orders arising from the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown in Minnesota.\n\nHis order filed Thursday was just the latest in a series of critical and sometimes scathing statements and rulings by federal judges in Minnesota and elsewhere across the country against how the Trump administration has attempted to conduct mass deportations of immigrants, often citing violations of due process and standards for humane treatment.\n\nIn a filing by a different judge Thursday, Rosen, the head of his civil division and ICE representatives were ordered to appear for a contempt hearing Tuesday over failures to comply with court orders for the return of detainees' property.\n\nSchiltz had previously described ICE as a serial violator of court orders related to the enforcement surge. In a Jan. 28 order, he expressed “grave concerns” after federal judges in Minnesota identified 96 orders that ICE had violated in 74 cases. In Thursday's order, Schiltz said the government's response “was not to do a better job complying with court orders, but instead to attack the Court.”\n\nRosen told Schiltz his office's own review of a “statistically strong sample” of 12 of those 74 cases found a high compliance rate, and complained that the tally by the judges “was far beyond the pale of accuracy for an order that would be wielded so publicly and so sharply. The lawyers in my civil division didn’t deserve it.”\n\nSchiltz wrote in a new order that he filed Thursday that he then asked his judges and law clerks to review the numbers. While he said they discovered some mistakes, which cut both ways, they concluded that ICE violated 97 orders in 66 of the cases referred to in his earlier order.\n\n“Increasingly, this Court has had to resort to using the threat of civil contempt to force ICE to comply with orders,\" he wrote. \"The Court is not aware of another occasion in the history of the United States in which a federal court has had to threaten contempt — again and again and again — to force the United States government to comply with court orders.”\n\nThe chief judge also attached a list that documented 113 additional order violations in 77 additional cases, mostly since the original tally.\n\n“The judges of this District have been extraordinarily patient with the government attorneys, recognizing that they have been put in an impossible position by Rosen and his superiors in the Department of Justice,\" Schiltz wrote, noting the wave of resignations that has left Rosen's office shorthanded. \"What those attorneys ‘didn’t deserve’ was the Administration sending 3000 ICE agents to Minnesota to detain people without making any provision for handling the hundreds of lawsuits that were sure to follow.”\n\nNeither Rosen nor ICE officials immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nRosen acknowledged at a news conference Wednesday — his first since taking office in October — that his staff of prosecutors has fallen dramatically. He bristled when it was pointed out that at least two criminal cases have been dropped in recent days due in part to the losses. Rosen said the office had 64 assistant U.S. attorneys on the last day of his predecessor's term; 47 as of Rosen's first day; and was now down to 36. But he also insisted he was hiring new prosecutors at a “good clip” and that his office still has the capacity to prosecute major crimes.\n\nThe chief judge ended with a blunt warning:\n\n“This Court will continue to do whatever is required to protect the rule of law, including, if necessary, moving to the use of criminal contempt,\" he wrote. \"One way or another, ICE will comply with this Court’s orders.”",

    "fullText": "Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles is to his position what Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori is to his.\n\nBefore we cover the top players the Seattle Seahawks might take in the 2026 NFL Draft, let’s talk about one that can continue to push modern defense into the futuristic mold Mike Macdonald changed the NFL with- who will certainly be going far too high for the Super Bowl LX Champions to have any chance at.\n\nStyles is setting the NFL Scouting Combine on fire today. He just recorded the best vertical jump ever for a linebacker at 43.5” inches and the 4th-best broad jump ever at 11’2”. Watch the all-time explosiveness right here:\n\n.@OhioStateFB LB Sonny Styles putting up insane numbers already:\n- 11'2\" broad jump (T-4th all-time among LBs)\n- 43.5\" vertical jump (best all-time among LBs)\n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/3Nshgb2Dyb\n\nIf you’ve followed our coverage of Emmanwori over the past season, you might know that we constantly reference his combine testing numbers. He announced himself to the world one year ago at this event with the best measurables ever seen by a safety since testing began in 1987. The Seahawks traded up to draft him and he was a game changer for their defense, allowing them to defend both the pass and run in ways other teams simply couldn’t. He has as bright a future as arguably any defensive player in the league right now. The only reason he fell to the 35th pick was because of the idea that “he doesn’t play a premium position”.\n\nStyles can reinvent linebacker in the same way. He won’t fall in this draft, where he’s a consensus top 3-5 player, despite the same ideas about positional value. Whoever drafts him will also know that he’s more than just a linebacker. He played safety for his first two-years of college in 2022 and 2023, and was only moved to linebacker right before the 2024 season. To have started his career as a safety with this frame, though, is downright scary.\n\nSonny Styles \n6050\n244\n10 hand\n32 7/8 arm\n80 7/8 wing\n\n— Daniel Jeremiah (@MoveTheSticks) February 26, 2026\n\nWhen Styles’ full testing numbers come out later tonight, don’t be surprised if people start calling him the best player in the draft. Since I started writing this article, the Emmanwori comps are already flowing in. The linebackers are running the 40-yard dash now, and if Styles does as well as he’s projected, the hype will continue to flood the discourse even more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: NFL Combine: Sonny Styles is the Nick Emmanwori of linebackers",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers' quarterback situation entering the offseason is a tough thing to get a read on.\n\nAaron Rodgers is still looming as a choice, so too young Will Howard, with Mike McCarthy having a reputation for developing young quarterbacks.\n\nBut which avenue will the Steelers go down? They aren't likely to truly contend with either Rodgers or Howard, but we know that Rodgers has a ceiling. We know nothing about Howard, so why not try him out?\n\nWell, for ESPN's Seth Walder, his 2026 quarterback prediction for Pittsburgh will give fans something to think about -- he's gone with Rodgers.\n\n\"I don't think Rodgers' return is a foregone conclusion, but Mike McCarthy's introductory news conference pushed me to thinking it will happen,\" Walder wrote. \"But I suspect the Steelers won't have the appetite to rebuild or take a flier on an unknown QB. So they'll try to re-create the Packers of yesteryear, with Rodgers and McCarthy at the helm.\"\n\nMore:Chiefs' predicted QB starter for 2026 named and it's not Patrick Mahomes\n\nThere's no denying that Rodgers gives Pittsburgh the best chance to win, but he is likely a short-term option.\n\nAt 42, whether or not he goes around again in 2026 is unknown. But for Howard, he hasn't gotten his chance yet, so why not let McCarthy mold him into the quarterback he wants?\n\nI'm not sure how Steelers fans would feel about another go-around with Rodgers, especially after some of the offensive performances of last season. If Howard did that, fans would be more willing to look past it, at least initially.\n\nWhat Pittsburgh does is unknown, but I'm not sure going forward with Rodgers is the way to go.\n\nAnalyst offers horror 4-word prediction for Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs\n\nESPN offers harsh Shedeur Sanders' Browns reality in franchise's QB search\n\nBengals give stunning Trey Hendrickson future quote that fans will love\n\nMike Evans' agent drops huge update over Buccaneers future\n\nVikings oddly predicted to go after Pro Bowl QB in free agency\n\nRams named landing spot for rocket-arm QB\n\nBills' Joe Brady reiterates stellar Keon Coleman desire",

    "description": "Some NHL GMs are facing pressure before the trade deadline, whether they're chasing the Stanley Cup or building for the long-term. Who's feeling the heat?",
    "fullText": "The NHL is speeding toward its March 6 trade deadline, and there are more than a few GMs feeling a pressure change.\n\nSome, if not most, GMs are under pressure to either steer their team into a playoff position or become a Stanley Cup front-runner – and that could mean making a splash on the trade front.\n\nOther GMs, however, are under pressure to stock their team with enough young, dynamic talent to power them through the next decade or longer, and making the playoffs right now isn't a must for them.\n\nBut not every manager is under pressure right now. For instance, San Jose Sharks GM Mike Grier and Dallas Stars counterpart Jim Nill are not feeling any heat right now, even though their teams are in drastically different points in their respective competitive cycle.\n\nThat said, there's no shortage of GMs who are feeling the heat in one way or another. Here are our choices for the four NHL figures that are on this week's NHL Hot Seat Radar.\n\nThe Oilers went into the NHL's Olympic break on a three-game losing streak – and in their first game back Wednesday night, Edmonton completely collapsed after leading 4-2 and lost 6-5 to the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nBowman's big trade acquisition – veteran goalie Tristan Jarry – allowed five goals on 25 shots and was pulled in favor of Connor Ingram.\n\nThe Oilers have sunk to third place in the weak Pacific Division, and they're only four  points ahead of the ninth-place L.A. Kings. So the potential for disaster in Edmonton is very real.\n\nBowman has to not only stabilize his team but make sure they are still a legitimate Cup contender after losing in the Cup final in 2024 and 2025. It's not going to be easy, as Bowman has less than $13,000 in salary cap space to use at the deadline. He does have two of his first-round draft picks in the next three drafts, though.\n\nThe first task at hand is clearing Andrew Mangiapane's $3.6-million cap hit, but with 12 points in 50 games, there's no guarantee any other team wants him.\n\nBut really, standing pat can't be an option for Bowman. He is now under as much pressure as he's faced since taking on the Oilers job in 2024.\n\nNHL Rumor Roundup: Will The Oilers And Sharks Acquire A Defenseman? With the March 6 NHL trade deadline fast approaching, the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks are believed to be in the market for defensemen.\n\nThe Lightning are 9-1-0 in their last 10 games, they're in first place in the East, and they've got a few million in cap space to improve their lineup by the deadline.\n\nAs a two-time Cup-winner, BriseBois doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, and he can go into the trade deadline confident that he's fully secure in his duties. So his seat is definitely cold.\n\nWhat will BriseBois be looking for prior to the trade deadline? A veteran who can boost Tampa Bay's offense would be ideal, particularly in the bottom six. Perhaps reacquiring Calgary Flames forward Blake Coleman would interest BriseBois.\n\nThe Lightning have been so dominant this season, you could see why BriseBois might stick with the group that's got the team this far this season. But in a very competitive Atlantic Division, Tampa Bay needs all the firepower it can get.\n\nArmstrong had to be disappointed coming out of the Olympic break, missing out on the gold medal with Team Canada. But the much bigger disappointment this season has been the Blues.\n\nGiven that Armstrong will be passing over the Blues' GM role to former star left winger Alex Steen, you'd have to imagine Armstrong is feeling more heat to trade St. Louis' veteran players for draft picks and prospects in a process that will shorten their retool.\n\nThe Blues have a slew of players other teams would have great interest in, including goalie Jordan Binnington, center Brayden Schenn, defenseman Justin Faulk, right winger Jordan Kyrou and maybe Robert Thomas.\n\nWhile it's likely a long shot that Armstrong completely empties his shelves and strips the Blues down to the studs, there aren't many sellers this season, which is driving up the asking price he'll get from teams interested in his players.\n\nThe Blues have been through this type of transition multiple times under Armstrong's tenure. But this year feels very much like bigger changes are coming to St. Louis. If Armstrong plays his cards just right, he's got the chance to use trades to set up his franchise for a long time to come when he remains president of hockey operations.\n\nNHL Rumor Roundup: More Blues Trades Coming, Latest Maple Leafs Buzz The Blues' trade of Nick Bjugstad before the Olympic break could be the first of several moves by them before the trade deadline, while speculation is growing over which players the Toronto Maple Leafs could peddle.\n\nAt this time last year, the Flyers were about to trade off some of their veterans – including Scotl Laughton, Andrei Kuzmenko and Erik Johnson – for picks and prospects. But this season, there are fewer Flyers players who look destined to be moved the way Laughton was.\n\nThis year, the Flyers are in a position to add players, not get rid of them – although they've got a big chip to play in the form of veteran D-man Rasmus Ristolainen. If Briere can convert Ristolainen into a center, the Flyers will be thrilled at the trade-off. But centers aren't easy to find or acquire, so Briere's search may not bear the kind of fruit the organization is looking for.\n\nPhiladelphia will have a whopping $32.2 million in cap space at the trade deadline, so Briere will be able to absorb a contract or two if it means acquiring long-term help. It won't be the worst thing in the world if the Flyers fail to make the playoffs, but the heat on Briere right now is all about how he positions the team for improvement over the long haul. Because next season, missing the playoffs won't be as acceptable.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – Suns owner Mat Ishbia made an appearance on ESPN’s “The Pat McAfee Show” on Wednesday and shared several bold ideas aimed at revitalizing NBA All-Star Weekend, which will be hosted in Phoenix in 2027.\n\nWith criticism mounting over the competitiveness and entertainment value of recent All-Star festivities, Ishbia and McAfee proposed a total $4 million incentive to restore prestige to two of the league’s most iconic events.\n\nThe idea seemed to stem from McAfee.\n\n“Let’s announce right now what we’re doing for the slam dunk contest,” McAfee said during the show. “You’re going to put a million dollars up for the winner and a million-dollar donation to the charity of their choice.”\n\nMcAfee also added the same prize would apply for the winner of the 3-point contest, bringing the total commitment to $4 million.\n\n“Done,” he responded immediately.\n\nWhile $4 million is no small pledge, even for an NBA owner and CEO of a major mortgage company, Ishbia expressed confidence that NBA commissioner Adam Silver would support the initiative. The proposal signals a willingness from NBA executives to directly address growing concerns that All-Star Weekend has lost its competitive edge.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Ishbia and McAfee will follow through on the proposal, but the urgency behind it is clear: the All-Star dunk contest has drifted toward irrelevance in recent years.\n\nThere was a time when the dunk contest defined All-Star Saturday night. Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins turned it into must-see television in the 1980s. Vince Carter’s 2000 performance remains one of the most iconic moments in NBA history. Even in the 2010s, Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon reignited excitement with an all-time show.\n\nRecently, however, most of the league’s biggest names have opted out of the event, leaving the spotlight to lesser-known players and less viewership of the event. The absence of established stars has been a recurring criticism.\n\nESPN personality Stephen A. Smith put the blame on LeBron James’ lack of participation in the 2026 contest, saying “we all know it was terrible because there was no star power,” while Shaquille O’Neal called this year’s performance “the worst dunk contest in NBA history.”\n\nThe NBA has no shortage of athletic ability. Today’s players are arguably more explosive than ever. Instead, the issue centers on participation. Established superstars often sit out of the contest for fear of injuries before the playoffs and a lack of financial incentive to compete.\n\nIshbia is confident the new incentive will attract some more big names to compete in the contests next year.\n\n“Let’s get the best guys in it,” Ishbia said. “Let’s make it awesome.”\n\nBeyond the contests, Ishbia is focused on elevating the overall fan experience as Phoenix prepares to host All-Star Weekend in 2027.\n\nThe CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage joined the action this year, suiting up for the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in Los Angeles. Next year, his presence will shift as a host rather than participant, helping shape the weekend’s structure.\n\n“I have a say in how to make it great … how do we get great players in it, how do we make it a great event, how to make the fan experience phenomenal,” Ishbia said. “We’re going to make it an amazing event.”\n\nFor the NBA, the stakes are significant. All-Star Weekend remains one of the league’s premier global showcases. Television ratings, social media engagement and sponsorship activations all hinge on delivering compelling content. If more star-studded names appear in the festivities, the ripple effect could extend well beyond one weekend.\n\nWhether Ishbia and McAfee’s bold pledge becomes reality is to be determined, but in a league driven by entertainment value, the Suns owner’s willingness to invest directly in the initiative sends a clear message: If NBA All-Star Weekend is going to thrive in Phoenix, it will not be for lack of effort – or funding.\n\nThis article first appeared on Cronkite News and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.",

    "description": "the 2025 NFLPA report cards have been revealed and the Bears have some interesting grades.",
    "fullText": "The NFLPA may not be allowed to publish their annual team report cards anymore, but that didn't stop the grades from getting out for every NFL team, including the Chicago Bears. Kalyn Kahler of ESPN obtained the report cards from the NFLPA for all 32 teams, and the Bears earned some high marks in some areas, as well as a few lower grades in others.\n\nThis is the fourth season in which the NFLPA has dished out grades for each team with reviews from players, but it's the first year the full results aren't available to the public. Nevertheless, Kahler was still able to get each letter grade for the different areas of review. These include facilities, training staff, nutrition, coaching staff, front office, and more. Below is how the Bears graded out in each of their areas:\n\nOverall, the Bears finished 13th overall, one place higher than last year's ranking. Their biggest gain, unsurprisingly, was at head coach with the arrival of Ben Johnson. He earned an A for his job helping lead the Bears to an 11-6 record to capture the NFC North division title. A year ago, the combination of Matt Eberflus and Thomas Brown earned a C. Another big improvement was the food and dining, which improved to a B grade after getting a C+ a year ago.\n\nOther notable areas included an A- grade for offensive coordinator Declan Doyle, who has since taken the same role with the Baltimore Ravens. It seems Doyle made a strong first impression as an offensive coordinator despite being just 29 years old at the time. Meanwhile, defensive coordinator Dennis Allen earned a C+, even though he had his unit taking the ball away at a staggering rate.\n\nFinally, the Bears remained consistent in a number of areas compared to last year's results. Players seem to like the weight room and locker room, while George McCaskey earned an A- for the second year in a row. Their treatment of families can still be improved, however, which received a C+ for the second year in a row.\n\nAlthough we won't get the full breakdown regarding the results like in years past, it's good to know the Bears are still near the top of the league in most categories according to the players. And they improved in the most important areas as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears earn mixed grades on NFLPA 2025 report card",

    "fullText": "After sustaining a distal biceps tear on \"WWE Raw\" this week, The Vision's Bronson Reed reportedly headed to Birmingham, Alabama with the expectation that he'd undergo surgery to repair it. The timeline for his subsequent recovery, meanwhile, has been relatively vague, with \"Raw\" commentator Michael Cole simply noting that Reed would be out of action \"indefinitely.\"\n\nOn \"Wrestling Observer Radio,\" journalist Dave Meltzer speculated in more specific terms. \"Nothing more [on updates], but if he does have surgery, which I presume he's getting, six or seven months out, generally,\" Meltzer said. \"So it's a long time out. If he went to rehab it without surgery, he probably could have made it back in four [months]. But yeah, from what I gather, he's getting surgery.\"\n\nReed's bicep tear occurred in the midst of his Men's Elimination Chamber qualifying match against Jey Uso and the original El Grande Americano (Chad Gable) on \"Raw.\" WWE reportedly penciled in Reed as the original winner of the qualifier, but due to his mid-match injury, Uso won instead and will now compete in the Elimination Chamber at the titular premium live event on February 28. Before injury, Reed was reportedly factored into WrestleMania 42 plans as well. Whether or not that will stay true has yet to be seen.\n\n\"The Tribal Thief\" is not the only Vision member sidelined with an injury right now as Bron Breakker continues to recover from a hernia that required surgery earlier this month. Elsewhere, The Vision's former leader Seth Rollins remains on the shelf with a shoulder injury he sustained at WWE Crown Jewel in October.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Tyler Glasnow pitched two-plus innings, retiring the first six batters he faced before coming out of the game after allowing a leadoff single to start the third inning.",
    "fullText": "Dodgers right-hander Tyler Glasnow is an admitted overthinker. But you wouldn't know it based on his efficient first spring training start Thursday against the Chicago White Sox at Camelback Ranch.\n\nGlasnow pitched two-plus innings, retiring the first six batters before coming out after giving up a single to start the third inning. Using a pitch mix that included a fastball that sat at 97 mph, Glasnow struck out the side in the first inning before recording another strikeout to close out the second. Having thrown just 28 pitches, Glasnow started the third inning and threw three more pitches before coming out of the Dodgers' 7-6 win.\n\n\"Very in rhythm,\" manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"Very efficient, used his entire pitch mix, it was really good. Good to see him get into the third inning. Positive day.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old entering his third season with the Dodgers credits his coaches for keeping his mechanics on point.\n\n\"It allows me to just go out and pitch and be athletic,\" Glasnow said after his outing. \"I'm able to just go out and play baseball as opposed to trying to tinker and fix certain stuff.\"\n\nThough he was plagued by injuries in his second season with the Dodgers, Glasnow finished on a high note, giving up just four earned runs over 21-1/3 postseason innings, good for a 1.69 ERA, pitching as a starter and a reliever. It was Glasnow’s first taste of the postseason as a Dodger, since a right-elbow injury ended his 2024 campaign in August, and was highlighted by his first career save in Game 6 of the World Series.\n\nGlasnow called the experience \"great.\"\n\n\"When you go in with all those nerves and that pressure and that excitement, it’s just such an unbelievable feeling to go out [there],\" he said last week. \"Especially to be a starter and a reliever and just to be thrown into different situations. It was awesome. It was extremely memorable for me, and I’m craving to do it again. And hopefully we can do it again and get a three-peat.”\n\nLooking to build off his impressive postseason, Glasnow enters the season with a newfound confidence.\n\nLast year Glasnow was placed on the injured list because of right shoulder inflammation at the end of April and did not pitch again until just before the All-Star Break. The Santa Clarita native has a long history of injuries — including Tommy John surgery in 2021 — and never has clocked more than 135 innings in a season.\n\nOver the winter he got married and made adjustments that he hopes will better his health. A successful season means staying off the IL.\n\n“Pitching well and staying healthy,” Glasnow said when asked about goals. “Just doing all that and trying to make as many starts as I can, and just executing every start and being healthy in the postseason.”\n\nWith most of the Dodgers’ regulars having made their spring debuts, there is one who has yet to get an at-bat in a Cactus League game: Mookie Betts. Roberts said his star shortstop will not play until Sunday at the earliest.\n\n“It’s load management,\" Roberts said. \"I wanted Mookie to start a little bit later, as far as not getting into spring training ready to go, and kind of use spring training to build up, given it’s six weeks. So, he’s building up nicely. So, he’ll be in the lineup soon.”\n\nInfielder Hyeseong Kim played his final spring training game Thursday, Roberts confirmed, as the utility man is set to join Team South Korea for the World Baseball Classic.\n\nKim has been perhaps the Dodgers’ most pleasant surprise of the spring, batting .462 with a 1.154 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, five RBIs and a home run in the sixth inning Thursday, while playing deft defense at second base and in center field.\n\nIt's a key development since Tommy Edman will start the season on the IL.\n\n“He’s had a great spring,” Roberts said of Kim. “I think his confidence is continuing to grow. His comfort level, being around the guys. I think he’s taking great at-bats. It was good to see him in center field yesterday. He made a couple of nice plays out in center field. We’re going to lose him shortly. He’s going to go to his team for the WBC, which I’m excited for him. Disappointed that we can’t watch him every day, but he’s had a great spring and looking forward to him having a great WBC and getting back.”\n\n Delivered at the start of each series.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Over 90 percent of NBA champions have won 40 games before losing 20. This year's very exclusive club is all set.",
    "fullText": "The 40-before-20 club for the 2025-2026 NBA season is set.\n\nWith the Boston Celtics' defeat at the hands of the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night, there will be only three teams that qualify under Phil Jackson's tried-and-true rule for NBA championship contenders. For those unaware, as I diagram every year, the legendary coach once asserted that a title-caliber NBA team must win 40 games before it loses 20 to be taken seriously as a group capable of winning that year's Larry O'Brien Trophy. It's a principle tied to great teams that build good habits in the context of a long regular season and accrue enough of a lead in the standings to avoid burning the jets through all 82 games.\n\nOver 90 percent of all champions in the last 46 years have won 40 games before losing 20.\n\nHere are the 40-before-20 teams for the 2025-2026 NBA season:\n\nThe reigning NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe upstart East-leading Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe ascending San Antonio Spurs.\n\nBased on the 40-before-20 rule, it stands to reason that one of these three squads will very likely be the 2026 NBA champion come June.\n\nOf course, we shouldn't necessarily treat 40-before-20 as an end-all, be-all type of rule. It's simply a matter of prior established precedent and the fact that great teams tend to win 40 before losing 20. But in a modern context, 40-before-20 might not hold as much water as it used to. In the last three years alone, a No. 8 seed (the 2023 Miami Heat), a No. 5 seed (the 2024 Dallas Mavericks), and a No. 4 seed (the 2025 Indiana Pacers) all qualified for the NBA Finals. None of them won it all, of course. But if not for a Tyrese Haliburton Achilles injury in Game 7 of the 2025 finals, perhaps the underdog Pacers' story ends differently.\n\nIf you make the Finals alone, regardless of whether you won 40 before 20, you have a chance to win it all. Why? Because we still have to play the games. One of these years, a team that didn't qualify for 40-before-20 will finally break through and win the championship again. I will contend that 40-before-20 should and will hold true most of the time, but not always.\n\nOn that note, the 2026 season is shaping up to be one where an outlier team is the last one standing.\n\nHere are a few NBA squads who missed out on 40-before-20 in 2026 but still certainly seem capable of winning it all this summer.\n\nAs long as they roster three-time league MVP Nikola Jokić, I believe the Denver Nuggets, who won the 2023 title, will always have a chance at the NBA title. This year, Denver has surrounded Jokić with the best team on paper that he's ever had. Health, in fact, was arguably the biggest reason the Nuggets fell short of the 40-before-20 mark. Health, for all intents and purposes, may also ultimately determine whether this version of Denver can reach its peak.\n\nIt may well depend on the availability of Jayson Tatum, but you should doubt the Boston Celtics at your own risk. In what was supposed to be a transitional year, Joe Mazzulla's team has plugged away at the near-top of the Eastern Conference standings all year. Jaylen Brown and Derrick White have predictably been brilliant. Key reserve Payton Pritchard has levelled up. And breakout talents like Neemias Queta have fueled the resurgent Celtics. If they get their face of the franchise back with plenty of on-ramp before the playoffs, the Celtics very well could win their second title in three seasons.\n\nI'm also high on the New York Knicks. Jalen Brunson's and Karl-Anthony Towns' defensive limitations are not enough for me to overlook what the Knicks are capable of. At the time of this writing, the Knicks have won 12 of their last 16 games. Any team capable of piecing together a midseason stretch like that deserves to be taken seriously as championship-worthy. The Knicks were a few bounces away from their first NBA Finals in a quarter-century last spring. Perhaps this is the year they make it back.\n\nIf this indeed is the sort of NBA season where a team on the outside of the 40-before-20 club wins the title, I'd venture to guess that one of these three mentioned squads will be the one to do it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Here are the 2026 NBA 40-before-20 title contenders, per Phil Jackson",

    "description": "Five USMNT World Cup candidates are still alive in the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League as Europe's knockout rounds take shape.",
    "fullText": "Five U.S. World Cup candidates playing across Europe’s top five leagues will fall well short of winning a domestic championship this season.\n\nBut as those campaigns hit the homestretch, culminating in May before attention turns to this summer’s World Cup, the group remains in the chase for continental trophies.\n\nOnly one current USMNT player has appeared in — let alone won — a Champions League final. Christian Pulisic was a sub in Chelsea’s 2021 triumph over Manchester City. His AC Milan team didn’t qualify for European competition this season.\n\nWith the knockout playoffs complete this week, highlighted by an extraordinary night in northwest Italy involving Weston McKennie and his ousted Juventus side, Friday’s draws will determine the Round-of-16 pairings in the UEFA Champions League, second-tier Europa League and third-level Conference League.\n\nAtalanta midfielder Yunus Musah\n\nBayer Leverkusen midfielder Malik Tillman\n\nAtlético Madrid midfielder Johnny Cardoso\n\nOlympique Lyonnais midfielder Tanner Tessmann\n\nCrystal Palace defender Chris Richards\n\nRegardless of how the Champions League draw plays out, Atalanta and Bayer Leverkusen will face a massive challenge: One will play Barcelona, the other Bayern Munich. Atlético Madrid will await Tottenham Hotspur or Liverpool.\n\nIn addition to the national team regulars, Diego Kochen, a U.S. under-21 national team goalkeeper, is a backup for Barcelona, which will take on Paris Saint-Germain or Newcastle. He has attended a senior national team camp but, without U.S. or Barcelona first-team appearances, is not in the World Cup mix.\n\nThe two legs will take place March 10-11 and 17-18.\n\nOlympique Lyonnais, the Europa League’s top seed after the initial stage, received a playoff bye and will face French rival Lille or Spain’s Celta Vigo on March 12 and 19.\n\nCrystal Palace, which knocked out Zrinjski Mostar on Thursday on a 3-1 aggregate, will clash with Mainz (Germany) or Larnaca (Cyprus) on March 12 and 19. Richards played every minute of the two legs against the Bosnian opponent.\n\nAside from McKennie, U.S. regulars with clubs that failed to advance in either of the previous two Champions League stages included Tim Weah (Olympique Marseille), Folarin Balogun (Monaco) and Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven).\n\nOn Thursday, despite a 1-0 victory at Stuttgart, Auston Trusty and Celtic were ousted from the Europa League on a 4-2 aggregate.\n\nThe elimination of Juventus and Monaco this week ended terrific campaigns by McKennie and Balogun, respectively.\n\nMcKennie started all 10 matches, scoring four goals, including a three-game streak between November and January. On Wednesday, his 82nd-minute header while his team was down to 10 men capped a three-goal aggregate comeback that forced extra time before Türkiye’s Galatasaray prevailed.\n\nWESTON MCKENNIE DOES IT AGAIN! 🇺🇸\n\nJuventus overturn a three-goal deficit to complete the comeback in Turin 🤯 pic.twitter.com/PnVKw0C1FZ\n\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 25, 2026\n\nBalogun, the U.S. team’s first-choice striker, also had a three-game scoring streak this winter, then recorded two goals against Paris Saint-Germain last week in the first leg of their two-game playoff. PSG advanced Wednesday on a 5-4 aggregate.\n\nAtlético Madrid reached the Round of 16 by routing Club Brugge 4-1 on Tuesday for a 7-4 advantage. Cardoso snapped a 1-1 draw early in the second half with his first goal in all competitions for the Spanish club.\n\nJohnny Cardoso's first goal for Atlético Madrid is a BEAUTY 🇺🇸🔥 pic.twitter.com/TDczQgmeky\n\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 24, 2026\n\nShould Atlético go the distance, Cardoso would return to a continental final; last year, he started for Real Betis in the Conference League championship loss to Chelsea.\n\nTillman missed Leverkusen’s 0-0 draw with Olympiacos on Tuesday with an ankle injury — his team advanced on the strength of a 2-0 away win last week — while Musah remained a bench warmer for Atalanta, which routed Borussia Dortmund 4-1 to overturn a 2-0 loss in the opener. In his first season with the Italian team, Musah has started two Champions League matches and subbed into four others.",

    "fullText": "Glen Kuiper, the former Oakland A's TV broadcaster who was fired after he used a racial slur on air while discussing his visit to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, will be returning to the airwaves, calling the radio play-by-play for the San Francisco Giants’ exhibition game against Team USA next week.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle first reported Kuiper's move across the bay, as well as the fact that Kuiper will fill in on about a dozen games after the team held “definite conversations” about the veteran broadcaster.\n\n“The Giants are committed to inclusion, respect and earning our fans’ trust,” Rachel Heit, the Giants’ chief marketing officer, told the Chronicle. “We had numerous conversations about the requirements for excellence we expect from our broadcasters. Glen’s addition to the broadcast team is reflective of how he’s approached his growth and what he’s demonstrated from an accountability perspective.”\n\nIt's been nearly three years since Kuipe's voice appeared during an MLB game, but the San Francisco Giants’ leadership believes he's taken \"full responsibility,\" according to Heit.\n\nThe moment occurred during his 17th season as the A’s play-by-play announcer, on May 5, 2023, when he is heard saying, \"we had a phenomenal day today at (N-word) museum and Arthur Bryant’s Barbecue,\" before a game between the A’s and Royals.\n\nBroadcaster Glen Kuiper opened the top of the sixth with an apology for something that he said earlier in the broadcast. No idea what that might have been. #Athletics #RootedInOakland pic.twitter.com/EnAkn7oSaR\n\n— Uprooted (@uprootedoakland) May 6, 2023\n\nKuiper later apologized for what he had said during the game's sixth inning.\n\n\"A little bit earlier in the show, I said something that didn’t come out quite the way I wanted it to, and I just wanted to apologize if it sounded different than I meant it,\" Kuiper said.\n\nAbout two weeks after the on-air incident, NBC Sports California fired Kuiper for using a racial slur.\n\n\"Following an internal review, the decision has been made for NBC Sports California to end its relationship with Glen Kuiper, effective immediately,” the network said in a statement released on May 22, 2023. “We thank Glen for his dedication to Bay Area baseball over the years.”\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Lindsay Schnell contributed to this article.\n\nNoe Padilla is a Northern California Reporter for USA Today.

    "description": "Denis Bouanga is staying in Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "Denis Bouanga is staying in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter months of transfer speculation linking the Gabon international with high-profile moves, LAFC announced Wednesday that it has re-signed the forward to a contract extension as a Designated Player through 2028, with an option through the 2029-30 season.\n\nMore history to make 😤\n\n📝 #LAFC and @BouangaDenis have agreed to a contract extension through 2028 with an option through the 2029-30 season.\n\n🔗 https://t.co/XYtihTc0pz pic.twitter.com/L6N1YuelJx\n\n— LAFC (@LAFC) February 25, 2026\n\n“At this club, performance matters,” LAFC Co-President & General Manager John Thorrington said in a statement. “Denis has delivered at an elite level with historic consistency since the day he arrived, and he has helped us win multiple trophies. This new contract reflects that. We’re proud of what he’s accomplished here and are motivated to continue building on that success together.”\n\nThe extension follows a winter of reported interest from multiple clubs. Inter Miami made a $13 million offer for the 31-year-old attacker while also pursuing Germán Berterame, but LAFC immediately rejected the bid. Reports also indicated that Brazilian side Fluminense submitted an offer in the $12-15 million range and had reached an agreement in principle with the player, with negotiations centering on payment structure.\n\nDespite the noise, Bouanga’s stance never appeared to waver.\n\nDuring the Coachella Valley Invitational, when asked directly by fans whether he was leaving, Bouanga responded emphatically: “I promise I stay.”\n\nThat promise now has formal backing.\n\nBouanga, who joined LAFC as a Designated Player on Aug. 5, 2022, quickly established himself as one of the most productive players in club history. He scored a stoppage-time winner in Portland to clinch the 2022 Supporters’ Shield and added two goals in the MLS Cup Playoffs as LAFC lifted the 2022 MLS Cup.\n\nIn 2023, he delivered one of the most prolific seasons ever by a Black & Gold player. Bouanga scored 20 regular-season goals with seven assists in 31 appearances to win the MLS Golden Boot, becoming the third player in club history to claim the award. Across all competitions, he recorded 38 goals and 14 assists in 48 appearances, tying the club’s single-season scoring record.\n\nHe followed that campaign with 20 goals and 11 assists in 32 regular-season matches in 2024, earning MLS Best XI honors and another All-Star selection. In 2025, Bouanga raised the bar again, scoring a career-high 24 regular-season goals. He became the first player in MLS history to post three consecutive 20-goal seasons and finished as a finalist for MLS MVP award for the second straight year.\n\nLast season, he also became LAFC’s all-time leading scorer, surpassing the previous mark of 93 goals. Bouanga now has 105 goals and 43 assists in 155 appearances across all competitions for the club.\n\nHis importance has only grown with the arrival of Son Heung-Min. The two formed one of the league’s most productive attacking partnerships, combining for 25 goals and eight assists (including playoffs) after Son joined the squad. Between late August and early October, the duo accounted for 18 consecutive LAFC goals, setting a new MLS record for most straight goals scored by two teammates.\n\nBouanga’s influence was on display in LAFC’s 3-0 win over Inter Miami in the 2026 MLS season opener. In front of 75,673 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, he scored the second goal of the night, sprinting past goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair before finishing into an empty net. He also provided multiple dangerous moments in transition as LAFC opened its campaign with a statement victory over the reigning MLS Cup champions.\n\nInternationally, Bouanga has earned 53 caps for Gabon, scoring 17 goals. He debuted in January 2017 and most recently recorded a hat trick in a World Cup qualifying win over Seychelles in September 2025.\n\n4' Denis Bouanga ⚽️\n34' Denis Bouanga ⚽️\n38' Denis Bouanga ⚽️@BouangaDenis wastes no time with a first half hat trick for Gabon in World Cup Qualifiers. 🇬🇦 pic.twitter.com/RR21e3Evo2\n\n— Major League Soccer (@MLS) September 4, 2025\n\nNow, with his future secured, Bouanga remains central to LAFC’s ambitions.\n\n“I’m grateful to LAFC for the trust they’ve shown in me,” Bouanga said via the club’s release. “From the beginning, my family and I have felt at home in Los Angeles. It’s an honor to represent this club and our supporters every time I put on the jersey. I believe in what we are building here, and I’m motivated to keep improving, winning more trophies, and helping this club reach even higher.”\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, both club and player have made their position clear.

    "description": "Quinn Hughes’ stock has done nothing but rise this year. Here’s what makes him so special.",
    "fullText": "Until recently, the general consensus was that Cale Makar is the best defenseman in the world, with Quinn Hughes as the clear No. 2.\n\nNow, the perception seems to be changing.\n\nSince the Vancouver Canucks traded Hughes to the Minnesota Wild in December, dozens of writers, podcasters and broadcasters have noted their shock at how good Hughes actually is — and his Olympic performance with Team USA only increased his stock.\n\nBut he’s the same player he always was. The difference is that more people are paying attention to him, being two time zones closer to the Eastern Conference and all.\n\nUtah Mammoth defenseman Nate Schmidt played a season with Hughes and the Canucks. It was only Hughes’ third year in the NHL, but Schmidt could already see that he was special.\n\n“You could tell it was all in there if he could just gather even more confidence when he has the puck,” Schmidt said. “He’s such a game changer. I think the gap between him and Makar has shrunk, and it’s always been pretty close.”\n\nQUINN HUGHES! USA WINS! 🦅 pic.twitter.com/WxbCRKxPiO\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 18, 2026\n\nPart of what makes Hughes so good is his ability to get through the neutral zone with the puck. Rather than skating forward, he turns his back to oncoming forecheckers.\n\nThat opens up passing options behind him and to both wings, in addition to the ability to pivot around the forechecker and advance the puck.\n\nThe more time you can spend in the offensive zone, the more likely you are to both score and prevent the opponent from scoring — and that’s a major factor in the 57 points Hughes has scored through 52 games this season.\n\n“His skating separates him,” said Mammoth defenseman Sean Durzi, who grew up around the Hughes boys when they lived in Toronto while their father was working for the Maple Leafs.\n\n“His conditioning, how efficient he is. He plays 30 minutes (a game) and it looks like it’s pretty easy for him, so that’s a credit to how well he’s done.”\n\nDurzi noted the game the Mammoth played against Hughes in Vancouver just before the trade, and Hughes had a hand in every one of the Canucks’ scoring chances in the first period.\n\n“He’s got that calmness to him that allows him to step up big in these pressured situations, but, like, he’s got that passion, too. I think the whole family’s got that love for the game and they want to be out there in those moments and I think he’s done a good job of that.”\n\nWith two parents who work in high-level hockey, it perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that all three of their boys became NHL stars. Durzi credits his three brothers for his success, and he noted that the same must be true of the Hughes brothers.\n\nThe Mammoth host Hughes and the Wild on Friday. Despite being in the same division as Minnesota, Utah has yet to lose to the Wild in regulation, and they’re a perfect 3-0-0 against Hughes as a Canuck.\n\nUtah head coach André Tourigny gave his thoughts about Hughes after the Mammoth’s practice on Thursday.\n\n“We know how good he is. He’s one of the best players in the world — all positions,\" Tourigny said. “I think there’s a debate to be made on a few, maybe five, six guys in the world, and he’s probably at that level.”\n\nAdded Schmidt with a laugh: “Makes me feel a lot better about myself, because if he can go out there and dominate and game-change in the Olympics, it makes me feel a lot better when he does it against me in the regular season.”",

Herbert is 0-3 in the postseason, and while he's had three double-digit winning seasons, each has ended the same way. Poorly.\n\nBut will 2026 be different? Mike McDaniel is his offensive coordinator, and hopefully, his two stud offensive linemen are healthy.\n\nFor ESPN's Seth Walder, this could be the year where it all comes together for Justin.\n\n\"Herbert has long been held in a slightly higher regard than his production would indicate, and the pairing with new offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel (and, ideally, two healthy tackles) should give us the opportunity to finally see Herbert perform with a favorable supporting cast,\" Walder wrote. \"This could be the year we see Herbert's elite ceiling.\"\n\nMore:Steelers' 2026 QB prediction nightmare fuel for fans\n\nI've been hearing it since his rookie season, and each year, Herbert, at times, through no fault of his own, others were his fault, has failed.\n\nSo, color me skeptical on that.\n\nBut McDaniels, as his OC, could be a game-changer. We saw his work with Tua Tagovailoa in the early stages in Miami, so the imagination runs wild with the thoughts of what he could be with Herbert.\n\nBut rather, seeing is believing, and in Herbert's case, he doesn't have the benefit of the doubt.

    "fullText": "Biggest NFL Combine takeaways from Day 1 of draft workouts originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL fans alike gather in person or around a television to witness something unique to football. Football is not the only sport that conducts a “Combine” to put incoming rookies through interviews, drills, medical evaluations and mental tests. However, it is the only sport where the “Combine” has become must-see TV.\n\nAlso known as the National Invitational Camp (NIC), the combine like everything else has a history. The four day football evaluation did not begin as the television event it is now. Just like the images of the NFL Draft decades ago, the combine used to be a small affair. Before 1976, the combine did not exist.\n\nIn the pre-1970s, NFL teams rarely conducted any sort of physical assessment of potential incoming college players. During that same period, the NFL Draft was also 17 rounds. Not the seven rounds it is today.\n\nThe first implementation any sort of physical assessment was actually started by the New York Jets who in 1976 invited prospects to their headquarters to be interviewed and tested.\n\n“Besides character and intelligence, the other non-football thing we put a premium on is the medical aspect,” Mike Hickey, the Jets’ director of player personnel, wrote in a column for The New York Times in April 1983. “We attempt to have every player we are interested in have an orthopedic physical by our team physicians.”\n\nThe early days of what would eventually become the Scouting Combine were just a series of visits. The opposite of pro day visits we have now. Instead of all the scouts and front office personnel travelling to Florida’s pro day or USC’s pro day, the prospects would travel to the respective NFL cities to be tested.\n\nThe process was complicated and expensive. In the early 1980s, Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm recommended to the NFL’s competition committee that teams should work together to “centralize the evaluation process”.\n\nThe first Combine took place in 1982 in Tampa, Florida. That first Combine included 16 teams and 163 players. The number of invitees has doubled over time to around 300 over the last decade plus.\n\nMore:2026 NFL combine: Full list of draft prospects\n\nInitially there were three groups of camps. The Indianapolis-based National Football Scouting Inc (NFS), BLESTO and Quadra Scouting. In 1985, all three camps were merged to save on operating costs. The central location in 1985 was Phoenix, Arizona. The central location for 1986 was New Orleans, Louisiana, however, in 1987 the venue was moved to Indianapolis where it has remained ever since.\n\nOver time more and more aspects were added to the process. Just like the old NFL Drafts consisted of a closed-door operation not open to the fans, so was the Combine. As the Combine itself evolved, so did the public’s interest in it.\n\nMore:How the NFL Scouting Combine got its name: Schedule, history and origins of the biggest NFL Draft event\n\nThe first ever televised NFL Scouting Combine didn’t occur until 22 years after its inaugural event in 1982. In 2004 the then new NFL Network aired six one-hour end of the day recaps on the events of the Combine. In 2005, those one hour recaps became two hour recaps. In 2006 and 2007 the Combine coverage grew to over 25 hours of television coverage.\n\nIn the 2020s, the Combine is viewed as the second largest and most important event in the pre-draft process. Second only to the NFL Draft itself. Today, the combine evaluations are critical to the work NFL teams do on these prospects. Game tape will always be No. 1, but right behind the in game evaluations is the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nDefensive Ends begin their workout, starting with the 40 times. Defensive End is a 'traits' position. They will naturally run better 40 times that almost all of the Defensive Tackles. In large part to a completely different body type as well as technique.\n\nVincent Anthony Jr - DE - Duke: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt: 4.85\n\nDavid Bailey - DE - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 4.51 / 2nd attempt: 4.54\n\nBailey checked speed off his to-do list. Bailey's time is the seventh fastest 40 time by a Defensive End in Combine history. The all time record belongs to Amare Barno (4.36). Bailey was not satisfied with his time.\n\nJaishawn Barham - DE - Michigan: 1st attempt: 4.65 / 2nd attempt: 4.66\n\nBarham pulled up and grabbed his hamstring in the last 5 yards of the 40 and still came within 0.01 of his uninjured time.\n\nDani Dennis-Scott - DE - Penn State: 1st attempt: 4.51 / 2nd attempt: 4.65\n\nGeorge Gumbs Jr - DE - Florida: 1st attempt: 4.70 / 2nd attempt: 4.66\n\nRomello Height - DE - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 4.64 / 2nd attempt: 4.65\n\nCashius Howell - DE - Texas A&M: 1st attempt: 4.60 / 2nd attempt: 4.60\n\nQuintayvious Hutchins - DE - Boston College: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMarvin Jones Jr - DE - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nNyjalik Kelly - DE - UCF: 1st attempt: 4.91 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMalachi Lawrence - DE - UCF: 1st attempt: 4.53 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMax Llewellyn - DE - Iowa: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt:\n\nTrey Moore - DE - Texas: 1st attempt: 4.55 / 2nd attempt:\n\nLT Overton - DE - Alabama: 1st attempt: 4.91 / 2nd attempt:\n\nTJ Parker - DE - Clemson: 1st attempt: 4.68 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMason Reiger - DE - Wisconsin: 1st attempt: 4.79 / 2nd attempt:\n\nR Mason Thomas - DE - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.67 / 2nd attempt:\n\nNadame Tucker - DE - W. Michigan: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nWesley Willaims - DE - Duke: 1st attempt: 4.90 / 2nd attempt:\n\nStacey Dales reporting: Miami DE Rueben Bain confirmed he will not run the 40 at the Combine.\n\n\"If they do the draft based on personality, we're looking at a Top 5 pick right there.\"\n\nEveryone in Indy is loving them some Lee Hunter.\n\n📺 #NFLCombine on @NFLNetworkpic.twitter.com/1cuC7882rD\n\n— Texas Tech Football (@TexasTechFB) February 26, 2026\n\nBroad Jump - Albert Regis: 9'8\"\n\nVertical Jump - Gracen Halton: 36.50\"\n\n20-yard shuttle - Jackie Marshall: 4.68 seconds\n\n10-yard split - Zane Durant: 1.66 seconds\n\nPlayers line up in their stance, the administrator of the drill pulls on the football on s stick, the player surges forward. The ball on a stick then indicates whether the player cuts right or left, bends around the corresponding cone and sprints ten yards downfield in a straight line.\n\nVery few players participated in this drill and those that competed all looked similar. Some bend a little wider, but all completed the drill with no directional or completion issues.\n\nIt's football on a stick time. This drill includes two large hula hoop like circles on the ground. Players will run a figure eight while picking up two bound towels and relocating them to the opposite side of the circle. This measures a players' 'bend'.\n\nIn addition to how they bend, towel placement is important. Players are expected to precisely place the towel. Taking it from three o'clock and moving it to nine o'clock on the respective hoops.\n\nGary Smith III of UCLA struggled with the towel placement, including one rep the had the second towel outside the hoop and at almost seven o'clock. Darrell Jackson Jr of Florida State also struggled somewhat. He is a large human. Fluidity and bend may not be his biggest strength.\n\nThe darling of this group Zane Durant did not participate in the Run the Hoop Drill. However, grading who did well and who did not followed suit with the Pass Rush Drill. Both grade smoothness and tightness in similar ways.\n\nThe school with the most prospects in Indy is @AggieFootball.\n\nTheir head coach Mike Elko stopped by the booth to chat with @MoveTheSticks and @RichEisen!\n\n2026 NFL Combine on NFL Network\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/cSH85fnhY2\n\n— NFL Network (@nflnetwork) February 26, 2026\n\nThe Run and Club Drill is more intended for what Defensive Tackles typically do. Attempting to shed or get around blocks within a confined space. The club is the easy part. The spin will have varied degrees of fluidity. The tricky part is the final turn and flattening.\n\nMost of the prospects struggled with the spin move aspect. Most lack the instinctive plant foot. Resulting in what looks like moving around the bag instead of spinning around the bag. The chop and rip aspect just before they need to flatten also gave some players issues.\n\nEach of these interior linemen move through this drill with speed and power. What separates the prospects is the ability to execute these moves in a phone booth. The wider the move the less impressive. Zane Durant, again, was by far the best competitor in this drill.\n\nAlso referred to as the 'Swim' drill. Players will drive off the line, hit the first bag, then run forward and swim the next bag, then a sprint to the finish. As it is a pass rushing drill, these will look less impressive than when we see the actual pass rushers doing this drill.\n\nThe following will be relayed as almost pass/fail. Interior defensive lineman typically will work the drill similarly. It will either look good, or it won't.\n\nNick Barrett, Rayshaun Benny, Zane Durant, Deven Eastern, Gracen Halton, Lee Hunter, Darrell Jackson Jr, Tim Keenan III, Jackie Marshall, Chris McClellan, Kayden McDonald, Tyler Onyedim, Albert Regis, Damonic Williams,\n\nCameron Ball, DeMonte Capeheart, Bobby Jamison-Travis, Kaleb Proctor, Gary Smith III,\n\nZane Durant was clearly the class of the group for the Pass Rush Drill. While Rayshaun Benny, Lee Hunter, and Chris McClellan were are better than the rest, Durant stood head and shoulders above the rest. There is real athleticism, not positional athleticism with Durant. He could create real creativity from a defensive coordinator with his agility and balance from the defensive tackle position.\n\n\"They call it the four bag agility drill because there are four bags on the ground\" Rich Eisen said. This drill is usually done with much more fluidity and smoothness when done by pass rushers, but it does measure agility and change of direction.\n\nRayshaun Benny of Michigan was the first defensive tackle to make this drill look smooth. Some minimal bag movement, but otherwise very smooth and fast.\n\nZane Durant followed Benny and made it looks easy. Kept his eyes down through most of it, which is not recommended, but very smooth. \"He's so athletic\" Jeremiah said after his attempt.\n\nBryson Eason had another smooth run of this drill. Perhaps not going all out speed wise, but enough that it didn't seem he was worried about the changes.\n\nDeven Eastern might be the first participant to do the drill at his top speed. Legs under him, no glaring mistakes, at full speed.\n\nGracen Halton had a really solid run. Fast with high knees, no bag infractions. Really solid.\n\nLee Hunter showed some stiffness in his hips, but made this drill look much better than the Wave Drill.\n\nTim Keenan III had an interesting run through the bags. Lateral movement looked much better than average but struggled in forwards and backwards transitions.\n\nKayden McDonald looked much better in the bad agility drill. No stumbles, close to full speed, lateral movement was good and he kept his feet under him.\n\nThe Wave Drill forces players to display lateral quickness and recovery speed. Most tackles will perform this similarly due to the nature of the position. When someone excels in this drill it pops off the screen.\n\nCaleb Banks anticipated the changes well, but lacks an explosiveness that shows up on screen.\n\nNick Barrett had an almost stumble early but saved it. Less controlled than Banks, but the results were better.\n\nFollowing Capeheart's 40 times, his Wave Drill was similar. Awkward movements but unquestioned results. Not smooth but fast and his cuts didn't slow him down.\n\nGusta and Halton both had stumbles after the first change of direction.\n\nLee Hunter was a bit choppy but remained in control, no slipping and no guessing the change. Very solid, just not fast.\n\nJackie Marshall didn't stumble and didn't miss at any point. However, he was yelled at throughout the drill to open it up. As if he was moving a little slower to better anticipate the changes.\n\nKayden McDonald fell on the first move clear to the turf. They cancelled his run and he'll get another change to try the first attempt again. His second attempt was better but not by much. No falls, but he did appear to be pacing himself (which teams don't love in this drill) and seemed to be confused on the direction queues.\n\nTyler Onyedim looked really good. One of the ones that pops off the screen. Completely under control, feet under him, adamant moves, good spring out of the cuts.\n\nIan Rapoport reporting: Tennessee Titans agree to trade DT T'Vondre Sweat to the Jets for DE Jermaine Johnson.\n\nAlbert Regis - DT - Texas A&M: 1st attempt: 4.92 / 2nd attempt: 4.88\n\nRegis had the best 'looking' start (1.73 split) of the tackles thus far. The first tackle to not have the drag foot start. High knees and driving through the line.\n\nGood start, not as good as the first one. Form got a little wide in the first ten, but he cleaned it up and improved on his already good time.\n\nKaleb Proctor - DT - SE Lousiana: 1st attempt: 4.80 / 2nd attempt: 4.84\n\nClean start (1.69 split), very fluid gate. Runs smoother than hard. Giving a very solid first 40 time.\n\nThe form lost a little something on the back end. Still a good time, he'll stick with the first 4.80 time.\n\nChris McClellan - DT - College: 1st attempt: 5.05 / 2nd attempt: 5.08\n\nA very clunky start (1.80 split), but recovered down the stretch make up some of that time. Comes out of his form early, but the drive/kick makes up for it.\n\nFirst step was faster but still had a drag foot on the second step. Really pushed through yards 10-20.\n\nJackie Marshall - DT - Baylor: 1st attempt: 4.88 / 2nd attempt: 4.92\n\nReally nice run. Good start (1.69 split) fluid throughout. Despite the smoothness, strong steps led to a very nice time. Shaving almost a tenth off the expectation.\n\nTim Keenan III - DT - Alabama: 1st attempt: 5.32 / 2nd attempt: 5.31\n\nKeenan is another larger DT. Another less than explosive start (1.84 split) but he recovered nicely with a steady but strong gate.\n\nGood start again. He looked to be ahead of his own pace at the midway point, but began to slow in the last ten yards. Giving him a slightly longer time.\n\nLee Hunter - DT - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 5.25 / 2nd attempt: 5.18\n\nThe first attempt will seem like a bad number, but Hunter is a large man. 6'4, 325. The 1.82 10-yard split is a little underwhelming; lacks a first step explosion you want to see.\n\nHunter made a significant improvement. Similar slower split but he drove hard down the stretch. Improving the time by seven one hundredths.\n\nGracen Halton - DT - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.83 / 2nd attempt: 4.86\n\nFaulted on the first start. Strange kick down the stretch, but it works. Halton gives a very good sub 4.9 time.\n\nLess than ideal start but with that same strange kick down the stretch. The start hurt this time as the back end was almost the same.\n\nDavid Gusta - DT - Kentucky: 1st attempt: 4.88 / 2nd attempt: 4.90\n\nReally solid first run. Good start, steps get more aggressive with each passing yard. Very solid at 4.88.\n\nThe second attempt was a very different run. Same good but not explosive start, but this time with a pronounced wide stride.\n\nBryson Eason - DT - Tennessee: 1st attempt: 5.12 / 2nd attempt: 5.09\n\nEason has a relatively fluid movement for a man his size. In control and steady. At 6'3, 315 that was a solid run. Could be big for Eason if he can get under 5.10.\n\nSame controlled, steady run except this time he cleaned up the start and improved his time. Getting under the 5.10 mark as previously predicted. 5.09 on the second attempt.\n\nZane Durant - DT - Penn State: 1st attempt: 4.76 / 2nd attempt: 4.77\n\nDurant comes in with an explosive expectation. Another angry runner. \"We weren't expecting turbulence, but we were expecting a fast 40 time. Both require a seat belt\" Daniel Jeremiah said on the broadcast.\n\nDurant delivers another impressive sub 4.8 time. Almost a carbon copy form wise. Good start and he drives with every step.\n\nBrandon Cleveland - DT - NC State: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.22\n\nCleveland maintains decent upper body form and didn't come out of his crouch until the finish line. Solid measured movement, in control.\n\nCleveland looked to have a good start, but something happened in the middle third. Appeared to be a hamstring pull, but he fought through it and didn't fully pull up until after the finish line. Eisen and Jeremiah could be heard audibly reacting with saying \"oh great\" at almost the same time.\n\nDeMonte Capeheart - DT - Clemson: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt: 4.86\n\nCapeheart is the first of this batch of 40 times to really move. Capeheart had a similar first start to Barrett, but Capeheart fully recovered in before the 10-yard mark and was really churning. Runs like he's angry at the ground.\n\nCapeheart has a way of running, but it works. Same angry, hard steps. Once he gets up to speed it looks awkward, but he's moving.\n\nNick Barrett - DT - South Carolina: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.11\n\nBarrett had a less than clean start on the first attempt but recovered after his second step. The time was not great at 5.11, but if he can clean up the start, he can shave a few hundredths off that time.\n\nBarrett 2nd attempt was exactly the same as the first. In time and form. Start was better, first step was much better, but lost a little something towards the end of the run. \"I think he's a 5.11 runner...\" Rich Eisen said as he crossed the finish line.\n\nCaleb Banks - DT - Florida: 1st attempt: 5.05 / 2nd attempt: 5.13\n\nBanks false faulted on the first two starts of the first attempt. On the third start, Banks ran a respectable time for his size. He looked like a large DT running a 40, but form remained constant.\n\nBanks struggled through his second run adding almost a full tenth to his time. Seemed to lose form and had labored steps in the final third.\n\nCameron Ball - DT - Arkansas: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.13\n\nBall's first attempt was mildly concerning. Clean start, however, his form broke down just after the 10-yard split and struggled to regain it until about the 30-yard mark. Could improve on the second attempt.\n\nSecond run was not better, but still acceptable. Clean start but slow in the first five. Came out of his form a little early.\n\nFinal Defensive Tackle 40-time leaders: Zane Durant - 4.75, Kaleb Proctor - 4.80, Gracen Halton - 4.82, DeMonte Capeheart - 4.85, David Gusta - 4.88\n\nStacey Dales reporting: 6'3, 335 Florida DT Caleb Banks will perform today despite a broken foot suffered in September. He will be a full participant. Ohio State DT Kayden McDonald will not run the 40 but is expected to participate in the bag drills to show his explosiveness.\n\nRich Eisen and Daniel Jeremiah have begun the broadcast from the NFL Network perch. First up will be defensive tackles. This group has some big names, a few could even crack the first round. Jeremiah has Lee as his No. 1 DT in the class. With Kayden McDonald, Caleb Banks, Peter Woods, and Christen Miller making up the top 5. All with the exception of Hunter have something to prove during this Combine.\n\n2026 NFL Scouting Combine: Defensive players with the most to prove\n\nA few guys to be on the lookout for in Group 1. @MoveTheSticks\n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/pDiKbmbXm4\n\n2026 NFL Scouting Combine Schedule\n\nPosition groups split up over the next four days in Indy 🏈\n\n2026 NFL Combine starts Thursday 3pm ET on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/XK47clg2Za\n\nRemembering a viral Joe Burrow Combine tweet:\n\nWhen Joe Burrow joked about retiring after getting his hand measurements at the NFL combine 😂🤚 pic.twitter.com/T1F5FytNxa\n\n— Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) February 26, 2026\n\nCombine News: According to the New York Post, Eagles General Manager has reversed his position on keeping WR AJ Brown.\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Quarterbacks\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Running backs\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Offensive line\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Wide receivers\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine rankings: Tight ends\n\n2026 NFL scouting combine: Defensive players with the most to prove\n\nLive stream: Fubo (free trial), NFL+\n\nThe NFL Combine can be live streamed wioth Fubo, which offers a free trial.

    "description": "Joe Schoen gets the worst grade of any NFL GM.",
    "fullText": "MetLife Stadium got an F- grade from players in the ‘home game field’ category of the NFL Players Association 2026 report cards, an annual survey grading franchises from A+ to F- in a variety of categories.\n\nThe New York Giants as an organization finished 25th overall. The Miami Dolphins were No. 1, and the Pittsburgh Steelers were last among the league’s 32 franchises.\n\nThe 2026 survey was the fourth annual. The first three were made public on the NFLPA website. The NFLPA did not post the results this year due to a grievance filed by the league. Nonetheless, ESPN obtained the report card results.\n\nTreatment of Families: B-\nHome Game Field: F-\nFood/Dining Area: B+\nNutritionist/Dietician: A-\nLocker Room: D\nTraining Room: B-\nTraining Staff: B+\nWeight Room: B\nStrength Coaches: B+\nPosition Coaches: B\nOffensive Coordinator: C+\nDefensive Coordinator: D+\nSpecial Teams Coordinator: B+\nTeam Travel: C\nHead Coach: C\nGeneral Manager: D+\nTeam Ownership: B\n\nHere are some thoughts on a few of the categories.\n\nThe turf at MetLife Stadium has long been a source of consternation among players. The turf was replaced in 2023 and is constantly tested by the NFL, with the league insisting its data shows the MetLife field among the safest in the league.\n\nI wonder if some of that grade is simply following the long-running narrative that the MetLife turf contributes to injuries. I also wonder if part of the grade is a reaction to an ugly, lifeless building that has played host to two of the worst teams in the NFL for most of the past several years.\n\nJoe Schoen of the Giants got, by far, the worst grade of any general manager in the league.\n\nA : Dan Morgan, George Paton, Chris Ballard, Les Snead, Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, John Schneider, Adam Peters\n\nA-: Eric DeCosta, Brandon Beane, Ryan Poles, Brad Holmes, Nick Caserio, James Gladstone, John Spytek, Chris Grier, Darren Mougey, John Lynch, Jason Licht\n\nB+: Terry Fontenot, Brian Gutekunst, Brett Veach, Joe Hortiz, Eliot Wolf, Mike Borgonzi\n\nB: Monti Ossenfort, Jerry Jones, Mickey Loomis, Howie Roseman\n\nWell, of course that players are tired of losing and don’t like Schoen’s product. I think, though, the grade also reflects unhappiness with how Schoen deals with players in negotiations, resulting in a possible lack of trust. It might be a part of the reason why Dawn Aponte was hired and could end up doing a lot of the team’s contract negotiating.\n\nWhatever the reason, it isn’t a good look for Schoen. Whether he wants to admit it or not, he has lost power in the organization, is fortunate to still have his job, and is in a battle to keep it.\n\nIt has been clear for a few years now that the Giants’ once state of the art locker room had become cramped and outdated. The organization is renovating the locker room space this offseason, and I would expect that grade to go up in 2027. The dining area has also been undergoing renovation.\n\nYeah, nobody misses Shane Bowen.\n\nI thought Mike Kafka would have fared better here after his stint as interim head coach.\n\nPlayers liked Brian Daboll well enough as a person. Daboll just lost the magic touch he had in 2022, and there weren’t any signs of it coming back.\n\nJohn Harbaugh: B\nMatt Nagy: C+\nDennard Wilson: B-\nChris Horton: B+\nGreg Roman: D-",

    "fullText": "In a month’s time, Spain and Argentina will face off in the much-anticipated latest instalment of La Finalissima. The European and South American champions will come face-to-face in Doha, with each keen to add another trophy to their cabinets ahead of this summer’s World Cup in North America.\n\nMuch has been made of the impending match-up between Lamine Yamal and Lionel Messi, although 20 other players on the pitch will decide the outcome. Right now, the result is too close to call, although Argentina midfielder Alexis Mac Allister has admitted that he sees Spain are being slightly ahead as of right now, as per Mundo Albiceleste.\n\n“Right now I see Spain above us. I think Spain and France are the two best, and we are there as well.”\n\nSpain are the FIFA ranked number one side at the moment, but Argentina are close behind in 2nd. However, La Roja are set apart by the fact that they have not only once inside 90 minutes since Luis de la Fuente succeeded Luis Enrique as head coach in the aftermath of the 2022 World Cup, that being against Scotland in his second match in charge.\n\nSpain may be considered marginal favourites by some, but Argentina have been there and done it in Doha, where they were victorious in the 2022 World Cup final against France. Whether that plays a part remains to be seen, but given how evenly-matched the two squads are, fine margins could determine who comes out on top – such as the expected absence of Nico Williams.\n\nIt promises to be a fantastic spectacle when Spain and Argentina face off at the Lusail Stadium. There is plenty of domestic action to come before the showpiece event, and that could have a say in who gets their hands on the La Finalissima trophy in Qatar.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts complimented Hyeseong Kim on his fantastic performances so far during spring training.\n\nHeading into Thursday’s game, Kim recorded hits in five of his 10 at-bats and had four RBIs with two stolen bases.\n\n“He’s had a great spring. Hyeseong, I think his confidence is continuing to grow,” Roberts said. “His comfort level, being around the guys, I think he’s taken great at-bats. It was good to see him in centerfield yesterday, made a couple nice plays out in centerfield.”\n\n“We’re going to lose him shortly. He’s going to go to his team for the WBC, which I’m excited for him. Disappointed that we can’t watch him every day, but he’s had a great spring and looking forward to him having a great WBC and getting back here.”\n\nKim continued his tear in Thursday’s win over the White Sox, clubbing his first homer of the spring in a 7-6 win. He will now look to carry his form into the WBC, as Thursday was his final game before departing.\n\nThe Dodgers will also hope he stays hot, as they’re looking for a suitable replacement at second base for Tommy Edman, who is still recovering from offseason surgery. Kim is putting together a strong case for himself, and will certainly get his shot with the Dodgers at some point this season if not Opening Day.\n\nThe post Dave Roberts Praises Hyeseong Kim After Hot Start to Spring appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "Derek Carr retired from the NFL last season after experiencing lingering shoulder pain from a labral tear. According to NFL […]",
    "fullText": "Derek Carr retired from the NFL last season after experiencing lingering shoulder pain from a labral tear. According to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, there’s a “strong belief” Carr is “very serious” about unretiring after a full year away from football.\n\nStill under contract with the New Orleans Saints, teams would have to trade for Carr rather than simply be allowed to sign him outright. Though, there’s a possibility New Orleans decides to release Carr the moment he unretires to avoid a $36 million cap charge for 2026, the final year of his contract.\n\nIn any event, Carr wants to play football again, and there are plenty of QB-needy teams who could be eager to give him a look. Below, we evaluate six teams that could consider adding Carr this offseason.\n\nNow led by two-time Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski, the Falcons still have 2024 first-round pick Michael Penix Jr. atop the depth chart. But he hasn’t proven himself as a bona fide franchise quarterback just yet. The Falcons may view the opportunity to add Carr as a way to raise the floor of the QB room while having him compete with Penix.\n\nAnother team set to move on from its franchise quarterback, the Cardinals will likely bring Jacoby Brissett back after a strong season. But there’s no guarantee a new coaching staff will get the same results, which could lead to Arizona capitalizing on Brissett’s newfound value. Meanwhile, a team that features one of the NFL’s best tight ends in Trey McBride, plus another potential superstar receiver in Marvin Harrison Jr., may see the value in bringing in another veteran who could immediately lead a winning effort.\n\nThe new-look Browns coaching staff appears intrigued by both Shedeur Sanders and Deshaun Watson. Dillon Gabriel is the other QB in Cleveland, but we wouldn’t imagine the Browns are ready to give up on the 2025 third-round pick. Yet, they also don’t have their franchise QB yet, so adding another arm like Carr this offseason is certainly possible.\n\nThere’s no telling what the Jets do this offseason, but there’s a lot of pressure on second-year head coach Aaron Glenn to get some wins after a woeful 3-14 debut season. Plus, 64-year-old offensive coordinator Frank Reich didn’t sign on just to lose a bunch of games. In other words, it shouldn’t surprise anyone if the Jets look for a veteran who can get some wins right away, and Carr fits the bill.\n\nLike the Cardinals, who are expected to move on from Kyler Murray, the Dolphins are likely done with Tua Tagovailoa. So, who will they get to replace him? Miami will be operating on a strict budget once they move on from Tagovailoa, who’s guaranteed over $50 million in 2025. Meanwhile, Carr hasn’t played in a full year and only made it through 10 games in 2024. In other words, he wouldn’t break the bank. Carr will need to prove he’s healthy and capable of playing at a high level first.\n\nThe Vikings’ QB room is extremely young. So, when they do add a QB this offseason, expect it to be a veteran who may not be a long-term solution. That’s where the 11-year-veteran Carr could be a perfect fit, not only serving as a bridge starter, but also by buying more time to evaluate J.J. McCarthy while he fine-tunes his footwork and accuracy. The four-time Pro Bowl QB could not only be a potential high-level starter in Minnesota, but he will also be able to help coach up McCarthy, too.\n\nArizona Cardinals Pro Bowler Wants To Be Cut From Team\n\nChicago Bears Receiving Trade Offers for Multiple Players\n\nMinnesota Vikings Share ‘Mutual Interest’ with Former First-Round QB",

    "fullText": "Packers General Manager Brian Gutekunst faces several challenging decisions in the 2026 offseason. Most notably, Gutekunst must find a way to create salary cap space to fully participate in offseason activities. The Packers are currently $1.5 million over the 2026 NFL salary cap.\n\nFree agency and the 2026 NFL draft are looming. Green Bay must enter these periods armed with ample cap space to fully capitalize. The Packers’ front office will need to make some challenging decisions to create that space. As a result, several notable veterans may find themselves searching for a new home.\n\nThe Packers’ offensive line managed several injuries over the course of the 2025 season. Young players stepped up and adequately filled the gaps created by veteran absences. Green Bay can take advantage of those successes by moving on from some established veterans on the offensive line.\n\nAaron Banks and Elgton Jenkins both rank within the top five cap hits for the Packers’ 2026 season. Banks ranked 69th of 81 qualifying guards in 2025, and Jenkins missed 10 games due to injury in his age 30 season. The Packers’ investment in these players has not been met with the necessary production to maintain the relationship.\n\nThe Packers could save nearly $20 million in cap space this offseason by moving on from Elgton Jenkins\n\nThe 2x Pro Bowler is 30 years old with an injury history and had contract disputes during last training camp.\n\nHard to imagine he stays on the team under his current contract. pic.twitter.com/VJBui9hF8c\n\n— SleeperPackers (@SleeperPackers) February 17, 2026\n\nRashan Gary represents another possible cap casualty for the Packers. Following a disappointing close to the 2025 season, Gary’s $28 million cap hit in 2026 is hard to justify.\n\nRemoving unfavorable contracts is a popular way to reduce salary cap strain. Another way is by extending contracts of existing players to move money around. Safety Xavier McKinney is just 27 years old and is one of the most effective players on the Packers’ roster.\n\nMcKinney only has two years remaining in his contract and has a cap hit of $19 million or \n\nThe Packers have options to create cap space. Any option that keeps good players in Green Bay should be celebrated.\n\nThe Packers finished with 3 players on PFF's Top 101 players of 2025 list: Xavier McKinney, Jordan Love and Micah Parsons. https://t.co/WTTEowC2uV pic.twitter.com/7qL2BSWJsD\n\n— The Packers Wire (@ThePackersWire) February 20, 2026\n\nThe post How Can the Packers Create Much-Needed Cap Space? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "fullText": "February is almost over and regular season baseball feels just over the horizon.\n\nWhile the wait continues, here are some of the top stories in the MLB today, including a potential buyer for the Padres, a pitching great returning to Toronto and rising revenue for the Braves.\n\nWith the San Diego Padres up for sale, a group led by the founder of a performance apparel company and an NFL Hall of Famer are putting their hats in the ring.\n\n“Joe Kudla, the owner and CEO of Carlsbad, Calif.-based Vuori, has partnered with Drew Brees, who began his decorated NFL career with the San Diego Chargers, in pursuit of the Padres, according to industry sources who were granted anonymity to speak freely about the franchise’s sale process,” report Dennis Lin and Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.\n\nFive bids have been put in to buy the Padres, with Golden State Warriors owner Joe Lacob and English Premier League club owner José E. Feliciano among the competitors.\n\nFormer Dodgers pitcher Max Scherzer is headed back to the Toronto Blue Jays for his 19th season, ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez reports.\n\nScherzer, who’s won three Cy Young Awards, is 41 years old.\n\nThis season will be his second with the Blue Jays, and his contract is for one year and $3 million.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves struggled in 2025, finishing fourth in the National League East.\n\nBut while they didn’t find success on the field, the MLB’s only publicly owned team still reported “surging revenue,” reports Evan Drellich of The Athletic.\n\n“The Atlanta Braves grew their baseball-side revenues 7 percent, to $635 million, the team said Wednesday,” Drellich reports. “Meanwhile, the club’s real-estate business surrounding its home stadium fared even better: a 45 percent jump to $97 million in 2025.\n\n“Revenues were up 11 percent overall for the year, to $732.5 million.”\n\nThe organization still reported an overall operating loss, but that was largely due to the end of a local television deal with Main Street Sports Group.\n\nThe team is now launching their own network, BravesVision.",

    "fullText": "Maine high school boys hockey playoffs 2026: Playoff schedule, brackets and results for Class A and B originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMaine's MPA Class A and Class B boys hockey championships have reached the final eight in each classification, and the first pucks in the next round will drop Friday night, February 27.\n\nIn the Class A quarterfinals, the four matchups will be played at the home ice of the higher-seeded teams, including the No. 1 seed Thornton Academy which will host the co-op team from Bangor/Brewer/Skowhegan/Narraguagus at the Biddeford Ice Arena. The winners of the four quarterfinal matchups will then advance to Tuesday's state semifinals at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland.\n\nClass B is divided into a North and South Division where the semifinals are the equivalent of Class A's state quarterfinals. But the semifinals in each division will both be held at a central location with the northern teams facing off on Friday and Saturday at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. The southern semifinals will be played back-to-back on Saturday at Portland's Troubh Ice Arena.\n\nHow to watch Maine boys hockey playoff games\n\nMaine state tournament schedules\n\nThe Class B South championship will then take place on Tuesday, March 3, at Cross Insurance Arena in Portland while the Class B North championship will be staged the following night at Alfond Arena in Orono.\n\nThen it's back to Cross Insurance Arena on Saturday afternoon, March 7, for both the Class A and B state championships which will be played back-to-back starting with the Class B title game at 1 p.m.\n\nWATCH:Maine high school hockey state championships, live on NFHS Network\n\nThornton Academy is the top-ranked team in Maine, ranked No. 16 nationally in the latest MaxPreps rankings, and the boys from Saco are the heavy favorites to win the Class A state title. The Trojans don't figure to be challenged much by the first-year co-op team comprised of students from Bangor/Brewer/Skowhegan/Narraguagus – aka, the Twin City Titans – as the only meeting between them resulted in a 10-0 loss by the newcomers back on December 20.\n\nIn fact, only one team has managed to outskate Thornton Academy this season as the Trojans have piled up an impressive 17-1-0 record. The Trojans' only loss came in a 7-4 upset by Class B Messalonskee back on December 6 in the second game of the season.\n\nThe first real test for Thornton Academy will likely come in the second round against the winner of No. 5 Falmouth and No. 4 Scarborough. The Trojans went 2-0 in the regular season against both those schools, but only managed to beat Falmouth, 3-2, back on January 3. Scarborough also held up well on defense in a 2-0 loss to the Trojans as recently as February 17, indicating that, at their best, either of the two potential semifinalists could at least challenge the frontrunners.\n\nIf the seedings hold, however, Thornton Academy would face the No. 2 seed Cheverus/Yarmouth in the state championship game on March 7. Cheverus/Yarmouth is more than capable of putting up a fight against the Trojans after taking them to overtime in a 4-3 loss back on January 10.\n\nIn the Class B ranks, Messalonskee is the No. 1 seed in the North Division, and as noted above, they are the only team to beat the Class A favorites from Thornton Academy this season. It was in convincing fashion, too, by a count of 7-4, and at 15-3, they are the team to beat headed into the Class B semifinals.\n\nThey'll take on the co-op team representing students from John Bapst/Hermon/Bangor Christian/Deer Isle-Stonington, a team they split with in the regular-season. The teams played back-to-back contests on January 31 and February 4 with Messalonskee winning the first game 3-2 before the co-op team turned the tables for a 3-1 win of their own. The rubber match will take place Saturday with the winner moving on to the Class B North championship next Wednesday at the University of Maine's Alfond Arena in Orono.\n\nThe No. 1 seed in the South division is Gorham/Massabesic, and they figure to have a tougher path to the title against the co-op team from Poland/Leavitt/Gray-NG/Oak Hill. The Gorham squad won both of their regular-season matchups, but both were one-goal affairs earlier this month on February 4 (2-1) and February 14 (3-2).\n\nMaine's Class A and B state championship games will both be streamed live on the NFHS Network. Those games will be played back-to-back on Saturday, March 7, at Portland's Cross Insurance Arena with the first puck dropping at 1 p.m. in the Class B title game.\n\nWATCH:Maine high school hockey state championships, live on NFHS Network\n\nFor local fans hoping to catch the state championship action in person, tickets will be available at the Cross Insurance Arena box office on the day of the game.\n\nTICKET INFORMATION: Maine high school boys hockey championships\n\nBelow is a full schedule of the remaining games in Maine's Class A and B boys hockey state championships.\n\nG1 — #5 Falmouth at #4 Scarborough\n\nG2 — #6 Edward Little at #3 Lewiston/Ararat/Lisbon/Morse\n\nG3 — #7 Fryeburg/Lake Region/Oxford Hills at #2 Cheverus/Yarmouth\n\nG4 — #8 Bangor/Brewer/Skowhegan/Narraguagus at #1 Thornton Academy\n\nBiddeford Ice Arena, Biddeford, ME\n\nCross Insurance Arena, Portland, ME\n\nCross Insurance Arena, Portland, ME\n\nCross Insurance Arena, Portland, ME\n\nG1 —Hampden/Ellsworth/MDI/Nokomis vs. Cony/Monmouth/Erskine/Mt.

    "fullText": "The NFL Players Association has issued its 2026 report cards. The grades have already leaked.\n\nThe NFL has reacted to the situation by sending a memo to all teams, a copy of which PFT has obtained.\n\n\"We understand that the NFL Players Association posted its 'Team Report Cards' on its players-only website today and we are aware that the media is reporting some of the purported results,\" the memo explains. \"As we previously advised, the admissions made by the union and its counsel during the grievance hearing — including that: (i) the Report Cards are 'union speech'; (ii) the union cherry-picks which topics and responses to include and exclude; (iii) players have no role in drafting the Report Cards commentary; (iv) the union chooses which anonymous player quotations to include and which ones to leave out; and (v) the union determines how much weight to allocate to each topic before assigning the 'grades' — confirmed that the Report Cards are neither reliable nor scientifically valid. In fact, these admissions explain the union's ongoing and steadfast refusal to share any data or information about the process that it inaccurately tries to characterize as 'scientifically valid.'\n\n\"Given these significant admitted limitations, we continue to recommend that Clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLA's agenda-driven exercise. We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results. Doing so only provides credibility to the union's media campaign.\n\n\"We will review the developments in light of the Arbitrator's decision.\"\n\nThe arbitrator's decision instructs the NFLPA to tell its members that the grades must not be leaked to the media. While it likely will be impossible to ascertain the source of the leak, it happened. Whether that justifies further action by the NFL under the Collective Bargaining Agreement remains to be seen.\n\nThe NFL declined comment to PFT regarding the leak of the report cards.",

    "fullText": "NFL Combine winners and losers: Live updates on defensive linemen, linebackers in Indianapolis originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL Scouting Combine is underway, and after four days of arrivals, interviews, exams, and meetings, the fun has finally begun.\n\nIt's time to watch the athletic testing and positional drills that skyrocket stocks, starting with the defensive linemen and linebackers. Defensive backs and tight ends will perform on Friday, with running backs, receivers, and quarterbacks headlining Saturday's festivities and offensive linemen rounding out the weekend.\n\nFor all the turbulence at other positions, the 2026 NFL Draft is strong in the front seven. Several edge rushers stand to be top-five picks come April. It's a preternaturally deep linebacker class, and the interior linemen will have starters drafted into Day 3. Perhaps more than any position, it's important to focus on size. Weight and arm length thresholds are king in the trenches, and many top prospects are fighting against historical precedents on their way to Round 1.\n\nAs these prospects vie for draft capital, we'll keep track of the most important performances of the day.\n\nWinner: Caleb Banks, DT, Florida\n\nAt 6062 and 327 pounds, Banks is every bit as big as we thought he was. The rest of his frame was even more impressive, posting 94th-percentile hand size, 94th-percentile arm length, and a 99th-percentile wingspan (via Trevor Sikkema).\n\nBanks is a freak, and ripping off a 5.05 40-yard dash on his first attempt is further proof that he is a different beast than us mere mortals. Banks fought through injuries this season, but if his 61st-percentile 40-yard dash is confirmed, it will be hard to keep that kind of upside out of Round 1.\n\nHis second run went for 5.13 seconds, but with 10-yard splits of 1.76 and 1.77 seconds, he's a comfortable winner early on Thursday.\n\nLoser: Cashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M\n\nHowell wasn't surprising anyone with his lack of length. But coming in with 30.25-inch arms is confirmation that he's a negative outlier and bound to hurt his stock. No edge rusher in MockDraftable's database (NFL Combine participants since 1999) has that kind of limitation -- by a half-inch.\n\nThat's a problem anyway one cuts it, and weighing in at 253 pounds (totally fine!) may not be able to compensate. He might need standout 40-yard dash and three-cone times to limit his fall, and even an optimistic view of his athletic profile is more about damage control than potential.\n\nHowell's film is promising. However, his arm length demands that coaches ask how they can mitigate his biggest weakness. Fair or not, that makes him more difficult to take in the top 50.\n\nWinner: Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio State\n\nHe hasn't run yet, but merely being measured has made Styles a winner of the week. At 6'5\", 244 pounds, he has more than enough muscle to make plays in the box. His 71st-percentile arm length stands out on film.\n\nMORE: NFL Combine measurements tracker 2026: Hand size, height, weight and more for Fernando Mendoza, other notables\n\nRemember, this is a former safety. His transition to linebacker went smoothly, and he eradicated his tackling concerns in his platform season. Styles has strong instincts and special movement skills, and in Indianapolis, he proved that he doesn't have to sacrifice physicality in the process.\n\nI expect him to bring the house down when it's time for the 40.\n\nUPDATE: He just posted a 43.5-inch vertical jump. That's the second-best mark for a linebacker since Cameron Wake in 2005 -- a full inch more than the next-best contender. We're shaping up to witness a truly incredible Combine performance.\n\nHe followed that up with a 4.46-second 40-yard dash, the fastest at the position. This was the best Combine a linebacker has had in years, and it might make him the best off-ball prospect since Roquan Smith in 2018.\n\nLoser: Peter Woods, DT, Clemson\n\nWoods entered the season as my top player and an easy selection for DT1. I'll remain higher than consensus, but the calculus has grown increasingly difficult. His 2025 campaign wasn't as impressive as his show-stopping 2024 film, and his pre-draft process hasn't gotten off to a roaring start.\n\nWoods weighed in at 298 pounds, lighter than anticipated and a signal that he might be shedding weight to shed time on his 40-yard dash. Then he didn't run.\n\nLikewise, Woods' arm length came in at 31.25 inches, a fourth-percentile mark for interior linemen. It's not the end of the world, given his ability to shed blocks and find solutions with athleticism. Still, it's an extra point of caution, and he didn't put his athletic prowess on paper.\n\nWinner: Kaleb Proctor, DT, Southeastern Louisiana\n\nProctor wasn't on my radar entering the event. That hasn't stopped him from leaving a mark on Day 1 of drills. Proctor ran a 4.79 40-yard dash with a promising 10-yard split.\n\nThroughout his athletic testing and positional drills, he looked like an easy mover. That bodes well for him to be a Day 3 selection as a rotational pass rusher, having turned his burst into nine sacks this season. Color me intrigued, especially if his 291-pound frame holds up on early downs.\n\nWinner: Malachi Lawrence, EDGE, Central Florida\n\nLawrence put himself on the map in Indianapolis. At 6'4\" and 253 pounds, Lawrence isn't quite as small as the class's most burst-dependent edge rushers. Still, he put on a show, setting the tone with a 40-inch vertical jump and 10'10\" broad jump.\n\n.@UCF_Football EDGE Malachi Lawrence:\n\n- 6'4\", 253 pounds\n- 40\" vertical jump\n- 10'10\" broad jump\n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/MopTX0d9eX\n\nHe didn't stop there. His first run was 4.53 seconds, trailing only David Bailey (4.51) at edge rusher (for first attempts). He'll have upward momentum during the pre-draft circuit, especially if he continues to move well during positional drills.\n\nLoser: LT Overton, EDGE, Alabama\n\nOne player who didn't move all that well was Alabama's LT Overton. It's important not to double-count these Combine drills for guys that test as expected.\n\nHowever, Overton was a bit slimmer than anticipated at 274 pounds. Even so, his 4.91 40-yard dash was tied for the slowest mark on the edge. It's hard to see Overton making a living as a sack artist at the next level; his run defense is his calling card. If he doesn't have the size to pull that off, Overton may lack the juice to be a starter on Sundays.\n\nFortunately, he moved a little better during positional drills to mitigate concerns.\n\nWinner: David Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech\n\nBailey didn't test like a generational freak, but he was still able to run a 4.51 40-yard dash to lead the position. He's doing his part to put minor movement concerns to rest, and the rest of his athletic markers were promising.\n\nHis 1.62 10-yard split was impressive, and his 35-inch vert and 10'9\" broad jump help insulate his profile. He also came in a little bigger than some expected, crossing the 250-pound threshold with 33.75-inch arms. This event was more about solidifying his stock than improving it. Bailey checked the necessary boxes to be a top-15 pick.\n\nWinner: TJ Parker, EDGE, Clemson\n\nParker was a prospect that fared unfavorably on my preseason board. The top-five hype was always rich, but as an early Day 2 selection, he has room to make some noise at the next level.\n\nPart of that equation is Parker's ability to convert speed to power. Running a 4.68 40-yard dash at 263 pounds is impressive and an indictment of his best pass-rushing trait. With the size to stick on early downs and fun flashes as a pass rusher, sneaking into Round 1 is possible, even if his stock tumbled with Clemson's playoff aspirations.\n\nLoser: R Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma\n\nR Mason Thomas talked a big game about his speed making up for perceived physical deficiencies. At 241 pounds, Thomas needs truly elite burst to compensate. Being a dynamic edge rusher has staying power on early downs if the ability to wreak havoc outweighs concerns against the run.\n\nInstead, Thomas slipped on his first run on the way to a 4.67 time. On his second opportunity, he was even slower, logging a 4.72-second 40-yard dash. It's a legitimately concerning mark that makes a strong Pro Day performance necessary. A bad day in Indianapolis doesn't have to kill his stock, but it means his work is cut out for him.\n\nLoser: Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami\n\nI'm not convinced this stint will impact his draft stock; the teams that like Bains will like him regardless of arm length. He's a nuanced pass rusher who solves problems to overcome his length issues, and he has a proven track record of producing and rising in big games.\n\nYet, Bain measured in at 263 pounds. That helps inform us that he intends to play outside full-time at the next level, rather than splitting time along the interior because of his lack of length. And reader, the length is indeed lacking. At 30 7/8\", he's operating as an outlier, prompting damage-control tweets and an extended look at his profile.\n\nIt would have been nice if Bain showed off his elite movement skills by testing or doing positional drills. We'll have to wait for his pro day, raising the stakes for an impressive performance.\n\nWinner: Gracen Halton, DT, Oklahoma\n\nThere's a growing need for pass-rushing defensive tackles, and Halton entered the Combine as a rotational asset with passing-down upside. He made a strong argument to be a Day 2 pick on Thursday with an elite showing.\n\nHalton posted the third-best vertical jump (36.5 inches) for defensive tackles since 1999, and he was also the third-quickest lineman at 4.82 seconds. More than just a burst-first tackle, Halton showed off a well-rounded athletic profile that included a handful of exciting positional drills.\n\nKyle Louis faced a familiar challenge for undersized linebackers -- ensuring his athleticism carved out a role on passing downs. It's safe to say he locked that down in Indianapolis.\n\nLouis had the fourth-best vertical (39.5 inches) and second-best broad (10'9\") jumps at the linebacker position. He won't outshine Styles, but backed by a 4.54-second 40-yard dash, there's more than enough dynamism in his profile.\n\nWinner: Arvell Reese, LB, Ohio State\n\nTesting as a linebacker, Reese needed to quiet the (few) contracting voices about his athleticism, largely based on the idea that he needs to be an elite athlete if he's going to transition to edge rusher full-time.\n\nOn Thursday, he showed off the same burst that quarterbacks saw when they were trying to scramble against Ohio State's defense. He posted a 4.46 unofficial 40-yard dash, meeting the moment. We'll see how he looks in positional drills, but it was a strong, if underrated, performance.\n\nLoser: Justin Jefferson, LB, Alabama\n\nIt would be hyperbolic to suggest that Jefferson had a bad set of drills. He posted a 4.57-second 40-yard dash, a 38.5-inch vertical, and a 10'5\" broad jump -- totally respectable times.\n\nHowever, athleticism was Jefferson's calling card at Alabama. Daniel Jeremiah even added on the broadcast that he could compete with the other Justin Jefferson on the 40-yard track, as he was among the fastest players on the field for Crimson Tide game days.\n\nInstead, Jefferson slightly fell short of expectations, generating good, but not great, athleticism scores and losing ground in what looks like an exceptionally athletic (and deep) crop of linebackers.\n\nWhy is Jordyn Tyson skipping NFL Combine workouts?\n\nFive measurements to look forward to at the NFL Combine\n\nTop snubs from the 2026 NFL Combine\n\nFive best fits for Ohio State safety Caleb Downs",

    "fullText": "Quinn Fordham Gray Sr. has added another assistant to his inaugural Florida A&M football coaching staff.\n\nOne that’s familiar to Tallahassee and Miami Dolphins fanatics.\n\nSam Madison Jr. is the Rattlers’ new cornerbacks coach. It was the position he played in the National Football League for 12 seasons from 1997 to 2008, nine with the Dolphins and three with the New York Giants.\n\n“Who else would you rather coach your corners? To have him as a part of the staff brings a wealth of knowledge and different experiences,” Gray told the Tallahassee Democrat at FAMU’s spring football practice on Thursday, Feb. 25.\n\n“He’s coached on the NFL and college level. His playing experience as well is going to lean towards giving these kids what they need from a standpoint of playing the position.”\n\nMadison appeared at Wednesday, Feb. 25’s 220 Quarterback Club luncheon with Gray and his FAMU football assistants.\n\nMadison was a four-time Pro Bowler and All-Pro selection, all with the Dolphins, while playing opposite of Patrick Surtain Sr., Florida State’s former defensive backs coach.\n\nIn 1999, he was the NFL’s co-leader in interceptions, picking off opposing quarterbacks seven times. He shared the honor with James Hasty (Kansas City Chiefs), Troy Vincent (Philadelphia Eagles), and Rod Woodson (Baltimore Ravens).\n\nMadison, 51, was a starter for the 2007-2008 season’s Super Bowl champions, the Giants, who pulled off a 17-14 upset against the undefeated Tom Brady-led New England Patriots in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nBefore his award-winning NFL career, Madison had already been intertwined with the Orange and Green. The Monticello native starred on the football field for the FAMU Developmental Research School Baby Rattlers. He was also a letterman for basketball, baseball, and track and field.\n\nMadison’s football talents landed him a scholarship to play at the University of Louisville, where he became, where he became an All-American talent during his four-year stint from 1992-1996. He’s a member of the Louisville Cardinals’ Ring of Honor.\n\nThe Dolphins picked Madison in the second round, 44th overall, of the 1997 NFL Draft. He was inducted into the franchise’s Walk of Fame in 2014.\n\nMadison has NFL coaching experience as a secondary and cornerbacks coach for the Kansas City Chiefs from 2019 to 2021. He was a staff member when the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 31-20 in Super Bowl LIV at Miami Gardens’ Hard Rock Stadium to conclude the 2019-2020 NFL season.\n\nMadison also spent 2022 to 2023 on the Dolphins staff as a cornerbacks coach and pass game specialist.\n\n“To be able to add a coach of that quality at this point is nothing short of amazing,” Gray said of FAMU’s new cornerbacks coach. “We’re happy to have him and looking forward to the work he’s going to put in.”\n\nFAMU football completed its second day of spring football training camp under first-year head coach Gray on Thursday. The Rattlers’ annual Orange and Green Spring Game is scheduled for Friday, April 3, at 6 p.m. on Ken Riley Field at Bragg Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe 2026 regular season begins when the Rattlers host the Albany State Golden Rams at Bragg on Aug. 29.\n\nQuinn Fordham Gray Sr., Head Coach\n\nToriano Morgan, Assistant Head Coach, Running Backs Coach, High School Recruiting Coordinator\n\nNicholas Sewak, Co-Offensive Coordinator and Offensive Line Coach\n\nRyan Lewis Sr., Defensive Coordinator and Linebackers Coach\n\nElijah Haggard, Special Teams Coordinator and Interior Defensive Line Coach\n\nReid Sanders, Quarterbacks Coach\n\nRon Dugans, Wide Receivers Coach and Pro Scout Liaison\n\nCasey Warming, Tight Ends Coach and Transfer Portal-Junior College Recruiting Coordinator\n\nDahon Mixon, Defensive Ends Coach\n\nSam Madison Jr., Cornerbacks Coach\n\nChris Cash, Safeties and Nickelbacks Coach\n\nMikey Victor, Defensive Quality Control and Nickelbacks Coach\n\nOrlando McKinley Jr., Assistant Special Teams Coach and Defensive Backs Coach\n\nNay'Ron Jenkins, Defensive Graduate Assistant\n\nBrian Norris Jr., Defensive Graduate Assistant\n\nBilly Rolle, Player Development and Director of High School Relations\n\nKennedy Marshall, Director of On-Campus Recruiting\n\nDavid Eggleston, Recruiting Graduate Assistant\n\nBrendan Deanda, Student Offensive Assistant\n\nGerald Thomas, III is a multi-time award-winning journalist for his coverage of the Florida A&M Rattlers at the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nFollow his award-winning coverage on RattlerNews.com and contact him via email at GDThomas@Tallahassee.com or on the app formerly known as Twitter @3peatgee.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tallahassee Democrat: FAMU football's Quinn Gray hires Sam Madison to staff, former NFL star",

State, Syracuse and Notre Dame were also critical to the Cardinals securing the No. 2 seed in the ACC Tournament and garnering the 9-0 road mark. Taj Roberts was ruled a gametime decision after suffering a Grade 2 ankle sprain against Virginia on Sunday but remained in the starting lineup. She played 37 minutes and finished with 12 points, four rebounds and two assists against the Yellow Jackets (12-17, 7-10).\n\nThe Cardinals had a 20-point scorer in six of the nine road games. Forward Elif Istanbulluoglu was two points shy of her second 20-point road performance of the season with a team-leading 18 points while shooting 50% from the field after scoring 23 points against Miami on Jan. 8.\n\nForward Laura Ziegler had 22 point-performances at Syracuse and Stanford. But she got in foul trouble against the Yellow Jackets and finished with four points, three assists and two rebounds.\n\nThe Cardinals upped its defensive intensity and forced Georgia Tech into 15 first-half turnovers and scored 20 points off the Yellow Jackets’ mistakes. In less than a minute midway through the second quarter, GT turned the ball over four times, giving way to the Cardinals’ 28-18 lead via a 6-0 run.\n\nThe Cardinals finished with 27 points off 22 Georgia Tech turnovers.\n\nLouisville returns home for the regular-season finale to play Notre Dame at 4 p.m. Sunday.

    "description": "Both Illinois and Indiana advanced their respective bills in an effort to lure the Chicago Bears out of the city.",
    "fullText": "Both Illinois and Indiana advanced their respective bills in an effort to lure the Chicago Bears out of the city.\n\nThe House Public Finance Committee advanced the bill Thursday that would freeze property taxes for mega projects like a Bears stadium in Arlington Heights.\n\nBut members of the Illinois House of Representatives adjourned without voting on the bill.\n\nThey will not return to Springfield until March 18.\n\nThe state has thus far failed to commit to infrastructure improvements and property tax certainty. And the Bears have not committed to where they want the team to go.\n\nAn amendment from Chicago-area state Rep. Kam Buckner outlines tax breaks on infrastructure the state would provide to entice the Bears to build in Arlington Heights, where the McCaskey family already owns the old Arlington Racetrack.\n\n\"I do you want the team to stay in Illinois. That's very important to me,\" Buckner said.\n\nIllinois lawmakers say they're not in competition with Indiana. They say they are moving at their own pace.\n\n\"We're operating in our lane, and I think the Bears will see we are moving in the right direction,\" Buckner said.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker spoke about the battle over the Bears on MS NOW.\n\n\"I am not going to be shaken down, and I have set out some very clear guidelines. And my guidelines are we are not going to fleece the taxpayers of the state of Illinois. We are not going to let the Bears do that,\" Pritzker said.\n\nThe full House needs to approve the bill before Pritzker would sign it.\n\nArlington Heights residents and some Bears fans showed up in Springfield Thursday.\n\n\"The Bears belong in Illinois, period. George Stanley Halas would be turning over in his grave if he knew they would even get out of the city of Chicago let alone the state of Illinois,\" Bears fan Marty Tadla said. \"It's the pride and joy of Illinois, Chicago Bears on the lakefront.\"\n\nSome opponents disagree, however. They believe the bill would be bad for taxpayers.\n\n\"This is likely the riskiest economic development program ever seriously propose, not just in Illinois history but in U.S. history,\" said Brian Costin, with Americans for Prosperity.\n\nThe revised mega-project bill was supposed to be heard last week, but got canceled at the last minute.\n\nArlington Heights Mayor Jim Tinaglia said in a statement, \"Thank you to our State Leadership, the Chicago Bears, and all of the local and regional partners who helped the Mega Projects Bill reach this important milestone. Based on the feedback we are receiving, we are very optimistic that the necessary support will be present for the Bill to pass both the Senate and House and advance to the Governor's desk in the coming weeks. We look forward to continuing our work with the team and state leadership to advance this project. Let's stay focused and keep our Pride and Joy in Illinois!\"\n\nChicago's chief financial officer was on hand Thursday to throw a \"Hail Mary\" pass to try to get Chicago back into the consideration. But it seemed to fall incomplete.\n\n\"This is a wake up call. Chicago is losing them. They're not even in the running anymore. This is between the burbs and another state,\" said Li Arellano, a Republican representing Dixon.\n\nIn Indiana, the state Senate passed a bill for a new Chicago Bears stadium in Hammond near Wolf Lake, 45-4.\n\n\"In Lake County, when one city rises, the entire region rises. This legislation positions Indiana, not as a spectator in economic competition, but as a contender,\" said state Sen. Mark Spencer, a Democrat representing Gary, Indiana.\n\nGov. Mike Braun said on X Thursday afternoon he signed the bill.\n\nWe made it clear from the beginning that Indiana is open for business. I’m thrilled to sign Senate Bill 27 to create the framework to build a new world-class stadium in Northwest Indiana. Now let’s get this across the goal line. pic.twitter.com/XTRFVTf1yl\n\n— Governor Mike Braun (@GovBraun) February 26, 2026\n\n\"We made it clear from the beginning that Indiana is open for business. I'm thrilled to sign Senate Bill 27 to create the framework to build a new world-class stadium in Northwest Indiana,\" he said. \"Now let's get this across the goal line.\"\n\nHammond Mayor Thomas M. McDermott Jr. said, \"I want to congratulate Governor Braun for signing into law Senate Bill 27 that sets up the framework to bring the Chicago Bears to Hammond and Northwest Indiana. This is a historic day for our state. The Bears have witnessed over the past several months how efficient government works. From the statehouse to city hall, Indiana continues to be ready to get to work and make Northwest Indiana the Bears new home.\"\n\n\"We would be honored to welcome the McCaskey family and Mr. Ryan to our partnership here,\" said Indiana state Sen. Ryan Mishler, a Republican representing Mishawaka.\n\nThe city of Chicago is still technically in the running to keep the Bears.\n\nThe Bears said in a statement, \"Indiana has taken important steps over the last few months, and we are grateful for the leadership reflected by Governor Braun signing SB 27, establishing the framework for a stadium development in Northwest Indiana. We continue to work on the necessary due diligence and appreciate the ongoing engagement with Indiana state and local leaders.\"",

    "fullText": "The NFL is a copycat league. And there's an emerging trend that one new head coach believes will soon be copied.\n\nBrowns coach Todd Monken has a prediction: There will be more downfield laterals.\n\n\"I do think that laterals are going to be a bigger part of our game,\" Monken said during a Wednesday appearance on PFT Live. \"I believe that you get these zone looks. Now, you've got to throw it to the guy you trust, because you don't want that damn thing on the ground. But I do think that is going to become more and \n\nMonken believes it won't be something that happens only in specific situations.\n\n\"Not just on third downs, not just on fourth down, not just as a gimmick play,\" Monken said. \"Obviously, Ben [Johnson] started doing that a lot in Detroit. Give credit where credit's due. And then others have started to do that a little bit more. And it takes some stones to do it. If the ball ends up on the ground, you're gonna get critiqued for it, but I can see the game going that way, where plays have built-in laterals. It just feels like it can go that way.\"\n\nIt's an effective way to counter a defense's pursuit of the ball and, if/when the defense is bracing for it, to get the defense a little wobbly and uncertain.\n\nStill, as Monken said, execution will be critical. A bad lateral potentially becomes a lost possession, followed by public and private questions as to the sanity of the coach who called the play.",

Only Adetomiwa Adebawore (4.49 — 4th round pick, 2023), Calijah Kancey (4.67 — 1st round pick, 2023), and Aaron Donald (4.69 — ugh you know him, 2014) had better forty times for interior defensive lineman prospects. All those guys were listed in the 280s — Adebawore 282, Kancey 281, and Donald 285 — where as Durant was 290 flat.\n\nDoes that mean Durant will go in the first round like Donald or Kancey? Not likely, at all. Durant was good at Penn State, especially as a junior, but his production was not on par with either of those Pitt guys. Kancey had 14.5 sacks and 27.5 TFLs his last two seasons in college, and Donald had 16.5 sacks and 47 (!!!!) TFLs his last two. Comparatively, Durant had just 7 sacks and 15.5 TFLs. And sure, the Big Ten in 2024 and 2025 was steeper competition than the Big East and ACC were back then, but that’s a big gap in raw production. Still, this was an overwhelmingly good day for Durant, who probably puts himself more squarely in the 4th round area and maybe could even sneak into the 3rd round.\n\nAs for DDS, it was a banner day. As you can see from the Dane Brugler tweet below, but DDS was one of the big winners from the defensive end group.\n\nDani Dennis-Sutton had a really nice day:\n\n4.63 40\n1.63 10\n39.5 vert\n10'11\" broad jump\n6.90 3-cone (!!)\n\n6-6, 256 pounds, 33 1/2\" arms, 10 1/8\" hands\n\n— Dane Brugler (@dpbrugler) February 27, 2026\n\nHis 40 time was 6th for a defensive end. His vertical was 4th. His broad jump was 1st. His 3-cone was first. And he did it at a shade under 6’6 and coming in at 256 pounds — which is a little on the lighter side for DDS, but it’s around the 260-ish he usually plays us.\n\nDDS was pretty squarely in the Day 2 (rounds 2-3) mix heading into today, and I think he cemented his floor as a Day 2 guy and might have opened up the possibility to sneak into the first round. He has great size, confirmed elite athletic ability, and solid production totaling 17 sacks and 25 TFLs the last two years.",

    "fullText": "It took a while, but Day 1 of NFL Combine workouts in Indianapolis got fun by the end. In particular, one position group more than any other looks like one the Bears should definitely dip into, and it might not be the one you think.\n\n1. I’m good on Kayden McDonald at No. 25.\n\nOne should never put too much stock into the Underwear Olympics when it comes to moving players up or down in the Combine. In the end, your resume is the tape.\n\nThat said, I feel like McDonald’s on-field workout revealed something he himself has hinted at in interviews with reporters: he’s more of a pure run-stopping 3-4 nose tackle than a 4-3 tackle at either the 1- or 3-technique.\n\nWhile he has the short-area quickness and strength you want inside, you can almost see the lack of versatility in his game when you watch him move. He simply doesn’t have the juice to consistently rush the passer, which you can see in his production (three total sacks in college). There’s something to be said for being REALLY good at your role, and McDonald certainly is that when it comes to stopping the run.\n\nBut if the Bears are still in the market for a defensive tackle at No. 25, I’d look at Lee Hunter over McDonald. Hunter’s the more complete player of the two, and is one of the few guys in this class you cannot single-block either in the run game or the pass game. If you do, he inevitably wins.\n\nI might even suggest waiting until the second round and look for guys like Christen Miller (Georgia) or Dontay Corleone (Cincinnati) if the value seems right.\n\nMcDonald will likely be solid at what he does in the NFL, especially in a system that fits his skills. I’m just not sure that system belongs to the Bears.\n\n2. T.J. Parker is not making it to the Bears.\n\nThroughout the week, I’ve heard from draft experts and scouts that the Clemson product was going to go earlier than Bears fans would want him to, despite some mocks and big boards suggesting he might be an option at No. 25. After the workout he just put together in Indianapolis, you can kiss any dreams of that goodbye.\n\nT.J. Parker is a DE prospect in the 2026 draft class. He scored an unofficial 9.33 RAS out of a possible 10.00. This ranked 138 out of 2046 DE from 1987 to 2026.\n\nSplits projected, all times unofficial, agilities left to run, bench tomorrow.https://t.co/v7lww9nouW pic.twitter.com/5LTupv1Slq\n\n— RAS.football (@MathBomb) February 26, 2026\n\nWe knew he was strong and had the baseline frame Dennis Allen might want a 4-3 defensive end. His speed (4.68 seconds in the 40) tore the track up, and his solid 34-inch vertical affirmed his explosiveness at 6-3.5, 263 pounds.\n\nAgain, though, these numbers only confirm what he’s already shown on tape, as he ranked 56th in total pressures last year among 853 qualified edge rushers. After that first set of edge rushers—Arvell Reese, David Bailey, and Rueben Bain Jr.—come off the board, Parker will likely be next.\n\nIf I were the Bears, I’d be looking for later options at edge and looking to bolster that position a different way. Because guys like Zion Young and Cashius Howell, who ran well but simply isn’t long or twitchy enough to be in play, aren’t likely to be the best players available at No. 25.\n\n3. The Bears will dip into this linebacker class.\n\nIt seems like the linebackers just get faster every year. Not a single one of these guys ran a 4.7s 40 or worse, and three players—Reese, Sonny Styles, and Kaleb Elarms-Orr—ran under 4.5. Obviously, the Bears will have no shot at taking those first two guys, who likely both will go in the top 10. But expect the Bears to do a lot of homework on this group after the day they collectively put together.\n\nAfter all, Chicago’s linebacker position is only slightly less problematic than the safety position this year due to impending losses—Tremaine Edmunds will be cut, Amen Ogbongbemiga has been cut, T.J. Edwards and Noah Sewell are injured and face long recoveries, Ruben Hyppolite II barely played, and DeMarco Jackson is a free agent/has made four career starts.\n\nExpect the Bears to sign some more veteran talent at linebacker to steady the ship and grab another linebacker either late on Day 2 or early on Day 3. They suffered too much from decimation at this position not to invest in it this year.",

The feature takes the load off your device using its own cloud-based computer and browser, allowing it to handle a variety of jobs ranging from scheduling appointments to generating study plans while you do something else.\n\nAs noted by Microsoft, you can describe what you need to Copilot Tasks using natural language, and assign Copilot Tasks to complete jobs on a recurring, scheduled, or one-time basis.

Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nCopilot Tasks appears to be Microsoft’s response to the agentic AI capabilities launched in recent months, including Claude Cowork, ChatGPT Agent Mode, Perplexity Computer, and the Gemini-powered “auto-browse” feature in Google Chrome.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you.

    "title": "OpenClaw: What Is It and Can You Use It Safely? (Malwarebytes)",
    "description": "OpenClaw is a hot topic at the moment. But what is it and how can you use the 24/7 AI assistant in a safe way?",
    "fullText": "An AI tool with a funny name has caused quite a commotion as of late—including some allegations of machine consciousness—so here is a breakdown on OpenClaw.\n\nLaunched in November 2025, OpenClaw is an open-source, autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agent that was made to run locally on your own computer, allowing it to manage tasks, interact with applications, and read and write files directly. It acts as a personal digital assistant, integrating with chat apps like WhatsApp and Discord to automate emails, scan calendars, and browse the internet for information.\n\nOpenClaw was formerly known as ClawdBot, but the project brushed up against the large AI developer Anthropic, because of its own tool named “Claude.” In response, OpenClaw’s developer quickly renamed the project to “Moltbot,” which brought impersonation campaigns from cybercriminals. The trademark trouble and the abuse that followed put a dent in OpenClaw’s reputation.\n\nAnother dent followed when Hudson Rock published an article about the first observed case of an infostealer grabbing a complete OpenClaw configuration from an infected system, effectively looting the “identity” of a personal AI agent rather than just browser passwords.\n\nThe case underlines an impending danger—and not just for OpenClaw, but for other AI agents as well. Infostealers are starting to harvest not just credentials but entire AI personas plus their cryptographic “skeleton keys,” turning one compromised agent into a pivot point for full‑blown account takeover and long‑term profiling.\n\nAs I stated before in a broader context, adversaries are starting to target AI systems at the supply‑chain level, quietly poisoning training data and inserting backdoors that only surface under specific conditions. OpenClaw sits squarely in this emerging risk zone: open source, moving fast, and increasingly wired into mailboxes, cloud drives, and business workflows while its security model is still being improvised.\n\nAt this stage of its development, treating OpenClaw as a hardened productivity tool is wishful thinking, since it behaves more like an over‑eager intern with an adventurous nature, a long memory, and no real understanding of what should stay private.\n\nResearchers and regulators have already documented prompt injection risks, log poisoning, and exposed instances that hand attackers plaintext credentials or tokens via poisoned emails, websites, or logs that the agent dutifully processes.\n\nFor anyone thinking about using OpenClaw in production, the bigger picture is even less comforting. OpenClaw runs locally but is designed to be adventurous: it can browse, run shell commands, read and write files, and chain “skills” together without a human checking every step. Misconfigured permissions, over‑privileged skills, and a culture of “just give it access so it can help” mean the agent often sits at the center of your accounts, tokens, and documents, with very few guardrails.\n\nIn fact, an employee at Meta who works in AI safety and alignment recently shared on the social media platform X that she was unable to prevent ClawBot from deleting a major portion of her email inbox.\n\nFurther, the Dutch data protection authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) warned organizations not to deploy experimental agents like OpenClaw on systems that handle sensitive or regulated data at all, flagging the combination of privileged local access, immature security engineering, and a rapidly growing ecosystem of dubious third‑party plugins as a kind of Trojan horse on the endpoint.\n\nMicrosoft provided a list of recommendations in this field that make a lot of sense. They are not specifically aimed at OpenClaw, but provide a conservative baseline for self‑hosted, Internet‑connected agents with durable credentials. (If these recommendations feel overly technical, it’s because safely using an AI agent with broad access is still an experimental and technical process.)\n\nWe don’t just report on threats—we remove them\n\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

    "description": "56% of CEOs report zero financial return from AI. PwC's 2026 survey reveals what the winning 12% do differently — and why solo founders can replicate it faster.",
    "fullText": "PwC surveyed 4,454 CEOs across 95 countries and asked them one simple question: is AI actually making you money?\n\n56% of CEOs — more than half — report zero financial impact from AI. No revenue gains. No cost savings. Nothing.\n\nOnly 12% — one in eight — have successfully used AI to both cut costs and grow revenue.\n\nThese aren't small businesses with no budget. These are the world's largest corporations, sitting on billions in capital, entire AI teams, and enterprise software contracts that cost more per month than most solo founders make in a year.\n\nPwC calls it something diplomatically understated: they say companies are running \"isolated, tactical AI projects\" that \"often don't deliver measurable value.\" The blunter term for what's happening is Pilot Purgatory — a place where AI gets used enough to feel like progress, but never deeply enough to create results.\n\nHere's the thing. If you're a solo founder watching this play out from the sidelines, this isn't discouraging. It's the biggest competitive window you've had in years. And most people aren't looking at it that way.\n\nBig companies don't fail at AI because of bad intentions. They fail because of structure.\n\nHere's what actually happens inside a large enterprise that wants to implement AI:\n\nA team identifies an opportunity. They write a brief. Legal reviews it. IT assesses integration risk. A pilot gets approved with a capped budget. The pilot runs for a quarter, produces mixed results (because every pilot does), gets reviewed by a committee, and then — if it's lucky — gets approved for \"further exploration.\"\n\nPwC's report is refreshingly direct about the root cause. The companies that aren't seeing results are treating AI as a tactical add-on — they're bolting it onto existing workflows rather than rebuilding workflows around it. They're using AI to marginally speed up what they already do, instead of using it to do things they couldn't do before.\n\nThe report calls for \"enterprise-scale deployment consistent with company business strategy\" with \"a clearly defined road map for AI initiatives.\" Which is exactly what bureaucracy makes nearly impossible to execute.\n\nThe term that matters here, and the one you should remember, is the difference between using a tool and building a system.\n\nAlmost everyone — 56% of the world's biggest CEOs included — is using tools.\n\nA handful of winners are building systems. That distinction is what separates the 12% from everyone else.\n\nPwC identifies the successful 12% with a specific label: the Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard aren't just using better tools. They've deployed AI differently — across more of their business, and specifically in the parts of the business that touch revenue, not just cost.\n\nHere's the number that matters: 44% of Vanguard companies apply AI directly to their products, services, and customer experiences. Among the remaining 88% stuck in Pilot Purgatory, only 17% do this.\n\nRead that again. The winners are almost 3x more likely to be using AI in what they actually sell — not just in how they operate internally.\n\nThis reveals a pattern that makes complete sense once you see it:\n\nThe average company uses AI to write internal emails, summarize meeting notes, and maybe help the marketing team generate social posts. It's productive, sure. But it doesn't change what they charge for or how many customers they can serve.\n\nThe Vanguard uses AI in the product itself. They're using it to make their service faster, more personalized, or more scalable. They're using it to reach customers they couldn't reach before, qualify leads more intelligently, or deliver outputs that weren't possible without a much larger team.\n\nThat's where revenue gets generated. Not from automating your inbox.\n\nHere's what the PwC report can't say directly (because it's written for corporate audiences), but what the data implies loudly:\n\nSolo founders are structurally better positioned to join the Vanguard than large enterprises are.\n\nNot because you have more resources. Because you have fewer barriers.\n\nSpeed of implementation. When you identify an automation that could save you 10 hours a week, what's your timeline from decision to deployment? Days. Maybe hours. There's no compliance review, no IT dependency, no cross-functional alignment required. You see it, you build it, you test it, you ship it. A large enterprise running the same decision through its normal process would still be in the committee stage six months later.\n\nFull-stack integration. In a large company, the marketing team uses a different system than the sales team, which uses a different system than the support team — and getting those systems to talk to each other requires months of IT work and often a six-figure integration project.\n\nAs a solo founder, you are the full stack. Your marketing AI, your sales AI, and your operations tools can be connected in an afternoon. You don't need permission from three departments to build a workflow that crosses functional lines.\n\nNo legacy infrastructure to protect. Large companies built their operations on systems that predate AI by decades. Retrofitting AI into those systems is genuinely hard — it requires changing processes that have calcified over years, retraining people who've developed habits around old tools, and managing the political risk of disrupting what's currently working. You don't have that problem. You can build clean.\n\nAlignment between decision and execution. PwC notes that the Vanguard requires \"an organisational culture that enables AI adoption.\" In a solo operation, you are the culture. You don't need to convince a skeptical executive team. You don't need to manage change across departments. When you decide to commit, you're committed.\n\nThe CEOs in PwC's survey spend nearly half their time — 47% — on issues with a time horizon of less than one year. They're trapped managing immediate problems, which leaves less time for the transformation work that actually moves the needle.\n\nYou have a choice they don't. You can decide today to spend time on building, not just managing.\n\nThere's a phrase worth coining here: the AI Execution Gap.\n\nIt's the space between companies that are experimenting with AI and companies that are deploying it at the level that actually produces results. Right now, that gap is enormous. Only 12% of the world's most sophisticated, best-resourced companies have crossed it.\n\nBut crossing it isn't about having more resources. The PwC data makes that clear. It's about how you deploy AI, not how much you spend on it.\n\nThe Vanguard companies share three characteristics that you can replicate right now, at any budget level:\n\nThey build foundations, not experiments. They don't test AI on a one-off project and walk away when results are mixed. They build the infrastructure — the integrations, the workflows, the data pipelines — that makes AI useful across everything they do. For you, this means setting up systems that run continuously, not trying AI once for a specific task and concluding it \"didn't work.\"\n\nThey apply AI where revenue lives. Vanguard companies put AI into their products and their customer acquisition, not just their back-office admin. For solo founders, this means using AI to make your core offering better or more scalable — to serve more clients at the same quality, or to charge more for a demonstrably superior result.\n\nThey commit to workflows, not tools. There's a meaningful difference between downloading an AI app and building an AI workflow. A tool does a task. A workflow replaces a process. The goal isn't to use ten AI tools occasionally. It's to have systems that run without you constantly making decisions — so your business keeps moving even when your attention is elsewhere.\n\nThe PwC report tells you what separates the winners from the rest. Here's how to apply it as a solo founder, starting this week.\n\nThe 26% of companies seeing cost savings from AI aren't doing anything exotic. They're identifying the repetitive, time-consuming tasks that eat their hours — admin, scheduling, data entry, first-draft content, support triage — and replacing them with AI workflows.\n\nYour version of this is straightforward: audit where your time goes for one week. Not where you think it goes — where it actually goes. Every task you do more than twice a week is a candidate for automation. Every task that requires gathering the same type of information repeatedly is a candidate for automation. Every task that produces a templated output is a candidate for automation.\n\nThe goal isn't to use AI for everything. It's to recover 10-15 hours a week so you can redirect them toward revenue-generating work.\n\n→ AI Ops & Automation: Browse Implementation Guides\n\nThis is where the 12% separate themselves. And it's where most solo founders are leaving money on the table.\n\nAsk yourself: what does AI enable me to deliver that I couldn't deliver before, or couldn't deliver at this price point?\n\nCan you deliver a service faster because AI handles the research and first-draft phase? Can you serve more clients simultaneously because AI handles onboarding and initial support? Can you offer a tier of your product that's AI-augmented and therefore higher-margin? Can you use AI to personalize your offering in a way that commands a premium?\n\nThe Vanguard answer this question and then build for it. They don't just use AI behind the scenes — they make it part of what they're selling.\n\n→ AI Content Creation: Scale Your Output | AI Lead Gen & Outreach: Fill Your Pipeline\n\nThis is the hardest one, because it requires a mindset shift rather than a tool change.\n\nPilot Purgatory isn't just a corporate disease. Solo founders fall into it too — trying an AI tool for two weeks, not seeing transformative results immediately, and moving on to the next one. The result is a collection of tools that don't talk to each other and workflows that are half-automated.\n\nThe shift is this: instead of asking \"what can I try with AI this week?\", ask \"what system can I build this month that will still be running six months from now?\"\n\nThat question points you toward workflows, not experiments. Toward integrations, not demos. Toward the 12% side of the chart.\n\n→ The Solo Founder's Guide Library: Full Roadmap\n\nPwC's 29th Global CEO Survey is nominally about large enterprises. But if you read between the lines, it tells you something specific and actionable about where the real opportunity is.\n\nThe world's biggest companies are in meetings right now trying to figure out AI governance, pilot approval processes, and enterprise-wide alignment frameworks. They'll be in those meetings for most of 2026.\n\nYou don't have to wait for anyone's approval. You don't need a committee to sign off. You don't need a multi-quarter rollout plan.\n\nThe AI Execution Gap is wide open. And unlike the CEOs in PwC's survey, you can start closing it today.\n\nAll statistics cited directly from the published report. Key figures: 56% of CEOs report no revenue or cost benefit from AI; 12% report both; 44% of \"Vanguard\" companies apply AI to products and services vs. 17% of other companies.\n\nHarran Ali is a technical founder, AI systems auditor, and automation architect.

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs.

Netflix, meanwhile, will get live F1 racing in the U.S. in May, continuing its strategy of frequent live event event programming.\n\nIn fact, the Netflix deal is just one of many efforts that Apple is taking to expand the reach of F1 ahead of the season kickoff next month in Melbourne, Australia. As with its deals with MLB and MLS, Apple will be integrating F1 content and programming within its other apps, including in Apple news (which will offer live look-ins to races), Apple Maps, Apple Music, and its other apps.\n\nAnd the company is striking partnerships with third-parties, in addition to Netflix. As previously reported Imax will simulcast some races, and the company will also partner with Fox’s Tubi to stream some “altcasts,” though it is not entirely clear what that will entail.\n\nApple secured F1 rights last year in a deal believed to be valued at $140-$150 million annually. The racing circuit had been with ESPN with years, crediting the sports giant with growing it tremendously.\n\n“They were the one who bet on us in a moment where there was not really a good confidence that we can grow as we are doing as a sport,” F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali told The Hollywood Reporter last year.

    "description": "\"This is going to be truly transformative — like completely transformative,\" Peter Mallouk said about AI. Here's his investing advice for rich clients.",
    "fullText": "Peter Mallouk says his clients are more diversified than ever amid AI's transformative impact on industries.\n\nAI's rise is causing unpredictable bouts of market volatility across stock sectors.\n\nMallouk suggests investors diversify more than before, and avoid trying to rotate too often.\n\nPeter Mallouk, the billionaire CEO of wealth management firm Creative Planning, says AI isn't like any past technology cycle — it's far more transformational, and that calls for investors to take action in their portfolios.\n\nMallouk told Business Insider that he's convinced AI is more impactful than other technological advancements by a long-shot, and the change it creates will likely be permanent.\n\n\"I think it's more than the internet, where the internet made everybody more efficient, or Microsoft with all their tools made everybody more efficient. This is something that removes 95% of the work in some roles. This is going to be truly transformative — like completely transformative.\"\n\nThat realization started to reverberate through financial markets this month, with AI panic hitting various stock sectors and a viral report from Citrini Research driving a sell-off on Monday.\n\nGiven the volatility and AI's unpredictable impacts on the market, Mallouk said that his roughly 3,400 clients worth at least $25 million are spreading their money out more than before.\n\nDiversification is fairly basic advice that you'll hear from most money managers — the more you hedge your bets, the more likely you'll be able to preserve capital.\n\nYet, in today's environment, it's especially important, Mallouk said, as AI disruptions seem to be catching investors off guard everywhere.\n\n\"I think the smart money is more diversified than ever,\" Mallouk said, adding: \"I mean, who would think that in the AI revolution, the big winners in the stock market would be energy and consumer goods? I mean, give me a break. You've got to be diversified.\"\n\nAs Mallouk sees it, being diversified today looks a little different for the average investor than it did in the past. While the traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% allocation to bonds has long been the standard portfolio, Mallouk said he prefers a broader, less conservative approach.\n\nLean more into equities than a 60% allocation, having exposure to both non-US stocks and stocks across all US sectors. Funds that offer exposure to these trades include the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) and the Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (SCHB).",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A representative of the U.S. Attorney’s office testified in federal court on Thursday that the human smuggling case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia was justified while acknowledging that the charges, coming two years after a traffic stop in question was “extraordinary.”\n\nAbrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has galvanized both sides of the immigration debate, claims that the criminal prosecution is vindictive and pushed by officials from President Donald Trump's administration to punish him after they were forced to bring him back to the United States. He wants the charges dismissed.\n\nWhile Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen, a court order from 2019 prevents him from being deported to that country. That's because an immigration judge determined he faced danger in El Salvador from a gang that had threatened his family. Abrego Garcia, 30, immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager but has an American wife and child. He has lived and worked in Maryland for years under the supervision of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAfter he was deported to El Salvador last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration had to work to bring him back. He was eventually returned to the U.S. only to face criminal charges of human smuggling based on a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBody camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia after he was pulled over for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nFirst Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire, who was acting U.S. attorney in April 2025, testified that it was his decision to charge Abrego Garcia, and he did so based on the evidence.\n\n“I had previously prosecuted several human smuggling cases,” McGuire testified. When he saw video of the traffic stop, “I was immediately struck by how similar what was being depicted in the body cam was to those investigations.”\n\nAbrego Garcia was carrying nine people in a car without luggage, the car belonged to someone with “a human smuggling background,” and the route was suspicious, among other things, McGuire said.\n\nHe said he was in close contact with the deputy attorney general's office about the investigation's progress but said that was common with high-profile cases.\n\nOn cross-examination, McGuire admitted that the timing of the charges, more than two years after the traffic stop, was “extraordinary.” McGuire said he had not previously been aware of the stop.\n\nHomeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Rana Saoud, who ran the Nashville region at the time of Abrego Garcia’s deportation, testified Thursday that she first heard of the 2022 traffic stop in April 2025, when someone forwarded her a news article in the Tennessee Star, a conservative online publication. Saoud said she was aware of the publicity around Abrego Garcia, who at that point was still in El Salvador.\n\nSaoud testified that she initiated the investigation and was under no pressure from higher-ups.\n\n“If the facts did not add up, we would have ceased to move forward,” she said. “The case just kept getting stronger.”\n\nOn cross-examination, Saoud agreed that the case was not high profile because of the nature of the criminal allegations but because of who the defendant was. “Mr. Abrego was in the news all the time at that point,” she said.\n\nDefense attorney David Patton said that a different HSI office in Baltimore knew of the traffic stop two years earlier but had never charged Abrego Garcia and closed the investigation after his March 2025 deportation. The case was reopened in Baltimore a month later, after the Supreme Court decision on Abrego Garcia’s deportation. By the time McGuire was aware of the traffic stop, federal agents with the Baltimore office had already interviewed the owner of the car Abrego Garcia had been driving.\n\nJose Hernandez Reyes, then incarcerated, told agents he had run a smuggling operation with Abrego Garcia as a driver for him, McGuire said. The same day McGuire learned about the traffic stop from Saoud, Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh emailed him asking to meet about Hernandez Reyes’ testimony.\n\nMcGuire emailed Singh regularly with updates on the indictment's progress. He said he did not know if Singh was sharing those updates with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche or Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n“I can tell you they never came back to say, ‘Put this in there,’ or ‘Say this,’ or ’Don’t say that’,” he testified.\n\nPressed about whether he might have felt pressure to prosecute the case, McGuire said, “I’m not going to do something that I think is wrong to keep my job.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw previously found some evidence that the prosecution against Abrego Garcia, who arrived at the courthouse with his wife Thursday morning, “may be vindictive.” The judge said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.” He cited a statement by Blanche that seemed to suggest the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.\n\nAbrego Garcia's attorneys have been sparring with prosecutors for months over whether officials like Blanche would be required to testify at Thursday's hearing and what emails Department of Justice officials would have to turn over to them. McGuire has argued that he alone made the decision to prosecute, so the motives of other officials were irrelevant.\n\nCrenshaw reviewed many of the disputed documents. In an order that was unsealed in late December, he wrote, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”",

    "fullText": "A New Jersey mom expected her third pregnancy would require more from her, but she wasn't prepared for the \"frightening\" experience that would come after\n\nSabrina B., a 38-year-old mom of three, tells PEOPLE that welcoming her third baby was the \"hardest\" experience she's had to date, noting she \"felt the difference immediately\"\n\nAfter giving birth, Sabrina received \"shocking and frightening\" news\n\nA New Jersey mom expected her third pregnancy would require more from her, but she wasn't prepared for the \"frightening\" experience that would come after.\n\nSabrina B., a 38-year-old mom of three, tells PEOPLE that welcoming her third baby was the \"hardest\" experience she's had to date, noting she \"felt the difference immediately.\" From the beginning of her pregnancy, Sabrina says she could sense it would \"require more from me physically and emotionally,\" and it proved to be \"challenging.\"\n\n\"The labor itself lasted 16 and a half hours, [which was] my longest by far,\" Sabrina says. \"Beyond the length of labor, it was the overall weight of the season that made it especially challenging. I was pregnant while raising a toddler and an almost preteen, trying to balance motherhood, healing, and everyday life. My body felt exhausted. I felt stretched thin physically and emotionally.\"\n\n\"Each pregnancy is different, but this one felt heavier,\" she adds. \"I was older, more aware of my body, and more attuned to when something didn’t feel right.\"\n\nA week after giving birth to her baby Alijah, Sabrina had a home visit from a postpartum nurse sent through a state-sponsored program. Upon checking her vitals, the nurse noticed that her blood pressure was very high and continuing to rise. In addition, Sabrina says her ankles and feet were visibly swollen.\n\n\"Without hesitation, she pulled out her phone and called my OB-GYN directly,\" she recalls, adding that her nurse's concern pushed her to take the next appointment with her doctor.\n\nBefore her appointment, Sabrina tells PEOPLE her symptoms started to intensify. In addition to her swollen ankles and feet and high blood pressure, she began passing large blood clots. On one occasion, she recalls her body suddenly feeling \"strange,\" like she was about to push out a baby again, while she took a shower.\n\n\"I passed a very large clot and started screaming and crying. It triggered past pregnancy losses I’ve experienced, and in that moment, I truly thought I was dying,\" Sabrina recalls. \"What scared me most wasn’t death itself. It was the thought of leaving my girls without their mother.\"\n\nAt her doctor's appointment, Sabrina tells PEOPLE she received the \"shocking and frightening\" news that she had postpartum preeclampsia. Since then, Sabrina has worked closely with her care team to regulate her condition. She explains that she was placed on blood pressure medication and has taken steroid injections to reduce inflammation.\n\n\"Those first two weeks postpartum, I could barely grip a pen, let alone my baby,\" she says, acknowledging that all the tests and work from her doctors have helped \"stabilize things\" for her over time. \"It’s been a medical journey — one I never expected — but I’m grateful it was caught early.\"\n\nSabrina, who is also a mom to Kameryn, 2, and Kaydence, 12, tells PEOPLE she's ultimately grateful that her daughter was born safely.\n\nDuring this experience, Sabrina was also navigating different nerve issues that left her unable to grip things properly. She says it also caused a tingling and numbness in her hands, making it \"scary\" to hold her baby.\n\n\"Many nights, my partner would pick her up when she cried, change her, and bring her to me to breastfeed because my body felt weak and I literally couldn’t,\" she says, adding that her partner, Arnaldo, 38, really supported her in this challenging moment. \"It required a lot of teamwork. It still does.\"\n\n\"I’m deeply grateful for his support throughout this entire experience,\" she adds. \"We’ve truly leaned on each other in raising our girls, and I don’t take that partnership for granted.\"\n\nSabrina has been sharing her life, especially her postpartum journeys, online publicly for 11 years. However, this time, she says she was different and needed to lean on the community she created.\n\n\"I shared because I genuinely wanted to know if other women had gone through this,\" she explains to PEOPLE. \"I needed hope. I needed reassurance that it gets better, that there are answers [and] that you’re not alone.\"\n\n\"I also wanted to bring awareness to heart disease, particularly among Black and Latina women — communities I am part of,\" she continues. \"Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death in our communities. We often normalize stress, but stress impacts our bodies in real ways. If sharing my story encourages even one woman to check her blood pressure, keep her postpartum appointment, get a second opinion, or listen to her intuition — then it’s worth it.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nLooking back at her birth experience, Sabrina tells PEOPLE she's most grateful for her support system and access to quality health care.\n\n\"I’m most grateful for my support system — my family, my best friend, my village — and for access to doctors who listened and took me seriously,\" she says. \"Healthcare can be expensive and overwhelming, and many women neglect their health because of that.\"\n\n\"I don’t take for granted that I had the resources and support to advocate for myself,\" Sabrina adds. \"And I hope other women know they deserve that too.\"",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Lawyers for student protesters detained in Pennsylvania for four days after a scuffle with police say their clients had no idea the stocky older man in street clothes who joined the fray and put his arm around a 15-year-old girl’s neck was the local police chief.\n\nThe attorneys said the students from Quakertown Community High School who were demonstrating against immigration enforcement policies acted in self-defense and will fight the charges. They include a simple assault charge elevated to aggravated assault, a felony, because the alleged victim is Police Chief Scott McElree.\n\n“He charged from his vehicle into the middle of this group of kids,” defense lawyer Donald Souders said Wednesday. “Many of the kids jumped in, in an attempt to defend her. They assumed that this was a counterprotester.”\n\nThe 72-year-old McElree, the attorneys said, arrived in an unmarked car, had no badge or hat or uniform on, and never identified himself. Videos posted to social media showed the tussle between students and officers.\n\nMcElree, who also serves as the Philadelphia suburb's borough manager, did not return messages left Tuesday and Wednesday at his home and office.\n\n“My client was directly choked by the chief. It was alleged that she had struck him, which she did not,” said lawyer Timothy Prendergast, who represents the petite 15-year-old girl. “They are innocent. They were exercising their First Amendment rights. The chief did not like that and acted outside of his authority.\"\n\nPrendergast's client and at least two others were released Tuesday, some on home confinement with ankle monitors. It was not immediately clear if the other two remained in custody Wednesday. The lawyers did not identify their clients, and juvenile court records are not public.\n\nSome residents have called for McElree to resign. Bucks County District Attorney Joe Khan opened an investigation, while also prosecuting the teens in juvenile court. The defense lawyers questioned whether he could remain impartial in both roles.\n\nAbout 35 students had staged a walkout Friday to protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies when police approached them outside a bakery, about a half-mile from school.\n\nSouders represents a 16-year-old boy who, he said, had his eyeglasses broken as he was knocked into a large planter by a uniformed officer during the scrum. The boy spent the weekend in custody trying to get glass particles out of his eye, and was seen there by a nurse before his father took him to a hospital Tuesday after his release, Souders said.\n\nHigh school administrators had met with the student protesters about the planned walkout, but then withdrew permission on Friday morning out of safety concerns, the acting superintendent said in a statement.\n\nMany in the group are students of color, and some are the children of immigrants, their lawyers said. Both Quakertown, with about 9,300 residents, and the high school, with about 1,650 students, are predominantly white.\n\nAccording to defense lawyers, the students were taunted along the route by another group of students yelling insults, including racial epithets, at them.\n\n“Throughout the protest, the police were following from a distance,” Souders said. “Probably in hindsight, they should have interceded between the protesters and counterprotesters. They were saying really awful things to get the kids riled up.”\n\nHis client, a high school junior who works two restaurant jobs, was released on home confinement with an ankle monitor, he said. He can leave home for school, work, church and other approved activities.\n\nAs juveniles, the teens have a right to an adjudication hearing within 30 days — or 10 days if they are in custody. However, the lawyers expect to seek more time to gather video and other evidence in the case.\n\n“This was an abomination of (police) escalation when it should have been a teaching moment for de-escalation,” said lawyer Ettore “Ed” Angelo, who represents another 15-year-old girl charged and released in the case.",

In D.C., \"unrest and uncertainty\" have become an issue, according to Scaramucci, who added that markets prefer \"evenness, predictability, and stability,\" while the \"on-again, off-again knee-jerking with tariffs is a mistake.\"\n\n\"I think it's hurting the markets,\" he continued. \"We could be doing way better if we had sound policies without capriciousness and uncertainty.\"\n\nThis conversation comes as once popular \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, such as Microsoft (MSFT), are experiencing pullbacks.\n\n\"Twenty stocks are holding up the market,\" Scaramucci said, adding that bitcoin's 50% correction is notable. \"Bitcoin is a leading indicator, so you're probably going to have a lot of roll-off in the stock market.\"\n\nCurrent market performance is also worth a look. Year to date, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 24.43%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has inched up 1% in 2026, the Russell 2000 (RTY=F) is up 6%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is down 1%.\n\nScaramucci sees any market downturn as temporary. \"I don't think it's going to be overly hellish, because you've got a lot of firepower from the Federal Reserve,\" he said.\n\n\"I still think [Fed chair Jerome] Powell, who is a data-dependent guy, will start cutting rates, particularly [if he sees weakness] in the overall marketplace,\" he said.\n\nScaramucci also intends to keep calm and carry on. \"Would I change my investment thesis because of this short-term stuff that's going on?\" he asked. \"I would not, and I would encourage people not to.\"",

The chipmaking giant has also purchased billions of dollars of CoreWeave shares and, last year, agreed to buy up to $6.3 billion of CoreWeave computing capacity if CoreWeave is unable to sell it to clients.\n\nCoreWeave's disclosure to analysts that Nvidia would assist in bankrolling its ambitious data center buildout came on the day that the two companies announced that Nvidia had bought $2 billion of CoreWeave stock and would \"accelerate\" CoreWeave's goal of rapidly scaling its artificial intelligence computing portfolio.\n\n\"In addition to continuing to procure our own capacity, CoreWeave will selectively partner with NVIDIA and leverage NVIDIA's financial strength to accelerate our procurement of land, power, shell, to try to better keep pace with demand,\" a spokeswoman for CoreWeave told Business Insider when asked about the analyst call. \"This could take several forms like credit enhancement, joint developments, etc., but will be determined based on the specific opportunity at that point in time.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman added that support from Nvidia or other partners \"should not be interpreted as the primary mechanism through which CoreWeave accesses capacity, nor as an indication that the company is unable to procure infrastructure independently.\"\n\nThe potential lease backstop from Nvidia shows how CoreWeave, a leader in the race to build out AI infrastructure, is marshaling the financial heft of business partners as it confronts immense costs. Moody's has forecast that CoreWeave could spend more than $30 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, more than double its expected outlay in 2025.\n\nPlatt said that the news of Nvidia's deepening commitment had initiated a \"pretty stark shift in sentiment\" among investors.\n\n\"If you were asking me about CoreWeave three months ago, I'd say that sentiment was pretty low,\" Platt said. \"I think now we're actually going to see sentiment around CoreWeave shift drastically to the positive side from investors.\"\n\nLast week, Business Insider reported that efforts in recent months to raise third-party construction financing for a data center that will be leased by CoreWeave in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, had been unsuccessful. Blue Owl, a major lender and investor in the data center development boom, disclosed that it had extended a $500 million short-term loan to the project that expires in March; it did not say how the $4 billion project would be financed beyond that.\n\nA lender familiar with the project's solicitations for construction financing told Business Insider that Blue Owl had been seeking about $1.4 billion in loans.\n\nCoreWeave stock fell after Business Insider's Friday report by as much 12% but has since rebounded.\n\nA CoreWeave spokeswoman told BI after its story was published that the Lancaster project \"is fully funded, under construction, and moving forward as planned.\"\n\n\"It's standard practice for capital allocators to evaluate a range of financing options when managing large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly in high-growth, capital-intensive sectors like AI,\" the spokeswoman said. \"There has been no change to the project's timeline.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if CoreWeave would seek to have Nvidia guarantee some or all of its lease payments to the Lancaster development. Such a backstop from the world's largest publicly traded company would likely make it easier to attract lenders and also potentially reduce borrowing costs based on Nvidia's strong credit rating.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that CoreWeave was arranging $8.5 billion of financing from a group of lenders, including Morgan Stanley and MUFG, based on customer contracts it has with Meta, in another example of how CoreWeave is leveraging its ties to some of the world's wealthiest companies to raise cash.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group declined to comment to Business Insider on the potential financing deal.\n\nPlatt said that a CoreWeave executive on the call said that Nvidia's plans to backstop CoreWeave data centers would be similar to an arrangement Google has with Fluidstack. In September, it was announced that Google would guarantee almost half of Fluidstack's lease payments for a Texas data center that Fluidstack will rent and Google will occupy. Like CoreWeave, Fluidstack is a so-called neo-cloud company that procures, builds, and operates AI infrastructure and computing and then leases it to customers.\n\nCoreWeave announces its fourth-quarter earnings for 2025 on Thursday. The rate at which it is spending money on AI infrastructure and the growth of its portfolio will be two closely watched measures of whether the company is scaling at the rate it has forecast to capitalize on the huge market opportunity it has touted.\n\nThe company previously stated it would end 2025 with 850 megawatts of operating data center facilities, according to a January research report by Deutsche Bank. A Morgan Stanley report on February 20 stated that \"easing investor concerns\" would depend, in part, on delivering that capacity. CoreWeave had 590 megawatts of power online at the end of the third quarter, according to Morgan Stanley. The report projects that CoreWeave's debt will grow to $38 billion by the end of 2026 as it spends to build. At the end of the third quarter, the company reported roughly $14 billion of debt at an average interest rate of around 10%.\n\nWhile CoreWeave's mounting debt has highlighted the risks involved in the AI buildout, the company has said that's outweighed by the huge revenues it will generate from the facilities it leases and builds out. At the end of the third quarter, the company reported a $55.6 billion backlog of contracted revenue, according to Moody's — rent that it can begin collecting when it builds and delivers its AI facilities to those customers.\n\nSteven McDonald, a director at S&P Global Ratings, said that if CoreWeave is successful in scaling fast and realizing that contracted revenue, its credit rating could rise, lowering the cost of its borrowing and increasing profitability. S&P has assigned CoreWeave a below-investment-grade rating of B+ with a \"stable\" outlook.\n\n\"They've kind of outperformed at a high level against a lot of the things that we were initially looking at, whether it be the customer concentration, access to power,\" McDonald said. It \"is carving out a role as a player in the AI data center space. The relationship with Nvidia seems like it's going well, if not strengthening, and those are things that will factor favorably in our credit analysis.\"",

    "title": "China's New Aircraft Carrier Looks Powerful – But It Has A Major Problem",
    "description": "China's naval capabilities have been expanding in recent years, but its newest aircraft carrier lags behind U.S. counterparts in some important ways.",
    "fullText": "On paper, China's latest aircraft carrier looks awesome. The Fujian was commissioned on the 5th of November, 2025, and is the third and most powerful addition to China's carrier fleet. Its introduction saw it crowned as the world's largest non-nuclear powered warship. Which should be a distinct feather in the cap for the builders of China's first domestically designed aircraft carrier.\n\nAnd while its conventional power is a disadvantage when compared to American carriers like the Gerald R. Ford, the rest of the ship looks like a pretty serious upgrade for China's naval capabilities. For instance, other than the aforementioned Gerald R. Ford, the Fujian is the only carrier in the world boasting electromagnetic catapults.\n\nIn theory, this system allows the carrier to launch heavier aircraft with greater fuel and weapons loads — attributes that should greatly improve the carrier's potential reach and operational flexibility. But scratch just below the surface, and it appears that Beijing's latest carrier has at least one serious flaw.\n\nThe nature of the problem was raised after military analysts questioned the efficiency of the ship's flight deck layout. Technical assessments of this design trait seem to point to a layout that can potentially create launch and recovery bottlenecks during combat operations.\n\nThis is critical, as the flaw introduces constraints in the very area that ultimately defines a carrier's combat value — just how quickly it can launch and recover aircraft.\n\nModern aircraft carriers are far removed from the early carriers that appeared almost as soon as aviation was a thing. However, regardless of the generation of carrier, one attribute has been critical throughout the type's history — how quickly it can launch and recover aircraft. This tempo is referred to as sortie generation, and it depends heavily on flight deck geometry, hardware, and a carefully choreographed flight deck sequence.\n\nWe already know a lot about China's newest aircraft carrier, but there are cracks appearing in its powerful facade. In interviews with CNN, former US Navy captain Carl Schuster and retired Lt. Cmdr. Keith Stewart pointed out aspects of the Fujian's deck configuration that could limit the sortie generation metric.\n\nAfter reviewing images of the carrier, they noted that the angled landing area crosses the deck at a narrower angle than on US carriers, reducing space between the recovery strip and the forward catapults. One of those catapults also appears to intrude into the landing area, which means it can't be used while the carrier is recovering aircraft.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Schuster said, \"The Fujian's operational capability is only about 60% of that of the Nimitz class.\" Essentially, it appears that the carrier can't launch and recover aircraft simultaneously, something that is considered a prerequisite for carriers of this size.\n\nThe ship's flaws were also noted in a documentary shown on Chinese TV. The broadcast featured a crew member explaining how landing aircraft cross two of the launching catapults before stopping in a maintenance area.\n\nThis problem doesn't make the Fujian ineffective; the carrier still represents a significant leap forward for China's navy. The inclusion of an electromagnetic catapult system alone expands the types of aircraft it can launch and the payloads they can carry. As noted, the Gerald R. Ford is the only other operational ship boasting such a system. Although the John F. Kennedy has just completed a major milestone on its way to commissioning and will soon join this exclusive club.\n\nHowever, the propulsion systems remain a defining difference, and this has played a part beyond merely how the ships are powered and how long aircraft carriers can stay at sea without refueling. The Fujian's conventional power system is believed to have contributed to the design constraints with the elevators, island, and support areas beneath the flight deck. For comparison, nuclear propulsion frees more internal volume and allows designers more leeway when considering deck layouts and aircraft manipulation.\n\nThis is why analysts now widely expect China's next carrier, often referred to as the Type 004, to be the first Chinese nuclear-powered sub, and to incorporate the lessons learned from the Fujian's layout.\n\nFor now, despite its undoubted powerful look, the Fujian appears less like the finished object and more like a transitional design. A design that bridges China's move away from ski-jump carriers to a future where it potentially joins the US and France as the only countries to operate nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow it to move ahead with ending legal protections for migrants from Syria, in the latest emergency appeal to the nation's highest court.\n\nThe Department of Justice wants the court to lift a New York judge's ruling halting the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end temporary protected status for Syrians while lawsuits play out.\n\nThe government is also asking for a broader ruling that could affect other cases over protections for people from other countries as the administration pursues its immigration crackdown.\n\nThe conservative-majority court has previously allowed immigration authorities to end legal protections for migrants from Venezuela as litigation continues.\n\nAbout 6,100 people from Syria have temporary legal status after fleeing armed conflict, according to court documents. Ending those protections could halt their authorization to work legally in the United States and expose more to possible deportation, especially the 800 people with pending applications, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nProtections for Syrians were first granted protected status in 2012, during a civil war that lasted for more than a decade before the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government in late 2024.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted to revoke protected status less than a year later, finding that the situation \"no longer meets the criteria for an ongoing armed conflict that poses a serious threat to the personal safety of returning Syrian nationals.\"\n\nImmigration lawyers challenged that decision, arguing that Syria was still wrestling with a humanitarian crisis and the swift revocation of legal protections would force Syrians in the United States to confront “impossible choices.”\n\nJudge Katherine Polk Failla, who was nominated by democratic President Barack Obama, agreed to delay the termination in November. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left her decision in place.\n\nThe administration argues that the department can grant or revoke the temporary protections and judges should not interfere. A response to the administration's appeal is due March 4.\n\nDHS has taken steps to withdraw legal protections that have allowed immigrants from multiple countries to remain in the United States and work legally. That includes a combined total of more than a million people from Venezuela and Haiti. A different judge in Washington recently blocked the administration from ending protections for 350,000 Haitians.\n\nThe administration has scored a series of wins on the Supreme Court's emergency docket allowing it to move ahead with key parts of Trump's agenda, though the justices handed him a significant defeat on tariffs last week.\n\nCongress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation is granted in 18-month increments by the homeland security secretary.",

    "fullText": "He said he bet his life savings on Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency failing to shrink federal spending — and won.\n\nNow, he's answering some questions.\n\nAlan Cole, a 37-year-old senior economist at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation in Washington, DC, said in a Wall Street Journal profile that he made a $342,195.63 bet on the prediction market Kalshi on whether federal spending in each quarter of 2025 would be higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nUltimately, it was, and Cole says he ended up winning $470,300.\n\nThat's a return of more than $128,000, or about 37%. He told the Journal that he made multiple sub-bets to spread out the risk and that he would only lose money if federal spending fell by more than $50 billion.\n\nFederal spending ultimately grew by hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025, despite DOGE's goal of slashing federal spending.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Cole addressed several questions that readers may have had about the bet.\n\nI'll do a little FAQ for if you clicked over to my profile from the WSJ article, which got more popular than I expected.\n\nQ: Was this a terrible risk?\nA: I promise it was fine and I was never worried about it. Closer to 100% than 99%, ex ante. The article mentions I considered it…\n\nFor one, he said he was \"never worried\" about the risk associated with the bet, viewing it as akin to a bond.\n\nHe also noted that federal spending is currently \"dominated by senior programs\" that have automated increases built in, plus interest payments on the national debt. \"Growth in these things is simply larger than the discretionary spending cuts,\" Cole wrote.\n\nCole also addressed whether it was a bad idea to risk such a large amount of money for a smaller return.\n\n\"Most good assets look like this, actually,\" Cole wrote. \"If anything, assets with potential for super-high returns relative to principal, like out-of-the-money call options, are the dangerous ones.\"\n\nHe also said that while he was taking a financial risk, he wouldn't lose everything if he lost his wager, given his \"big future earnings potential\" and assets like his home and a retirement account.\n\nCole also said he didn't \"hate\" Musk, as some might think.\n\n\"He has a mixed legacy for sure,\" Cole wrote, \"but I wish him the best especially on his most productive enterprises like SpaceX and Tesla.\"",

    "fullText": "Google is ramping up pressure for more employees to use AI — and it's not just software engineers who are expected to embrace it.\n\nIn recent weeks, managers at Google have informed some workers in non-technical roles that they are also expected to use AI in their workflows, four employees familiar with the changes told Business Insider.\n\nIn some cases, non-technical staff have been explicitly told that their AI use would be considered in their performance reviews later this year, two of the employees said.\n\nThe changes mark the next phase of Google trying to infuse AI into every corner of the company. Last year, Google told some software engineers that using AI was being formally made part of their job expectations, Business Insider previously reported. Google leaders have said that AI is increasingly responsible for code generated at the company.\n\nLike its peers, Google has been encouraging employees to use AI in the hopes it will make them more productive. Meta employees were told that their 2026 performance reviews would assess their \"AI-driven impact,\" Business Insider previously reported. Microsoft leaders have also told staff that AI is no longer optional.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai told employees last year that the company's rivals would be harnessing AI internally, and so Google must do the same.\n\nExpectations for using AI at Google vary across teams and roles. Engineers are expected to use AI coding assistants that can generate code and answer technical questions. Non-technical employees are being pushed to use AI to create strategy documents, analyze sales calls, and build customer insights, two members of staff told Business Insider.\n\nIn some cases, these expectations are being formally enshrined in employees' role profiles — an internal description of their job's tasks and expectations. Two employees in non-technical roles told Business Insider they were explicitly told by managers that their use of AI would be considered during performance reviews, known as Googler Reviews and Development (GRAD).\n\nTwo employees in sales roles told Business Insider they are expected to use internal AI tools that record phone calls and take notes. Some of them have been given quotas of how many times a week they are expected to use the tools, they said. In some cases, expectations will also be tied to seniority. A third employee said they were told that more senior staff were expected to demonstrate a better understanding of AI use than their more junior counterparts.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Business Insider that managers across technical and non-technical roles have the discretion to evaluate employees based on their use of AI. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that some software engineer roles would be graded on their use of AI.\n\nGoogle has been gradually turning up the dials on AI use internally. In June, engineering vice president Megan Kacholia sent an email to software engineers encouraging them to use AI tools and informing them that their job descriptions were updated to include using AI to solve coding problems.\n\nGoogle CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the company's Q4 2025 earnings call that around 50% of code at Google is written by agents, which is then reviewed by human engineers. That number appears to be increasing: Pichai put the figure at over 30% in April.\n\nGooglers are generally permitted to use only their company's internal AI tools. Employees can ask questions to a special version of Google's Gemini chatbot, named Duckie, that is familiar with internal documentation. There is also a coding tool named Goose, which is trained on Google's technical history, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nInternal AI tools are also designed so employees can input sensitive company information without risking it being leaked to the public. In some cases, these are third-party tools that have been modified for Google's internal needs. One tool used by Cloud sales employees is Yoodli, an AI avatar that sales reps can role-play conversations with before picking up the phone to call a customer.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "For example, they kept their outfits simple on the red carpet for the 2014 Breakthrough Prize ceremony.\n\nZuckerberg wore a black tuxedo and satin tie, while Chan sported a sparkling, sleeveless dress in a deep shade of blue.\n\nFor a state dinner that year, Zuckerberg sported his usual black suit, tie, and dress shoes.\n\nChan, on the other hand, looked elegant in a vibrant red dress with a lace overlay. She paired the garment with a black clutch, simple sandals, and an updo hairstyle.\n\nZuckerberg continued attending events like the 2016 Axel Springer Awards in dark suits and white undershirts. Rather than accessorizing, he added only belts and dress shoes.\n\nChan, on the other hand, began sporting all-black ensembles that year. For the awards ceremony, she donned black leggings underneath a knit tunic and ankle-length boots.\n\nFor the annual Breakthrough Prize ceremony, Zuckerberg wore a black tuxedo with sharp, satin lapels and his signature tie.\n\nChan dazzled alongside him, wearing a black sleeveless dress beneath a glitter-covered fishnet overlay with a high neckline and long sleeves.\n\nThey both walked the Breakthrough Prize red carpet in black suit jackets, with Chan wearing hers over a solid black gown.\n\nZuckerberg swapped his usual necktie for a bow tie.\n\nThe couple attended the 2024 UFC 300 event in April while wearing casual yet cool outfits. Zuckerberg wore a white T-shirt with black jeans, and Chan donned a black blazer as a dress with sunglasses and a gold necklace for accessories.\n\nThen, in May, Zuckerberg celebrated his birthday while wearing a graphic tee and a gold chain.\n\nZuckerberg's fashion changes might have been strategic. Meta announced in 2024 that it was working to win over Gen Z.\n\nThe Facebook founder could have been doing the same by upping his style reputation.\n\nZuckerberg, who matched fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos at the event, wore a navy suit, white button-down shirt, and deep red tie.\n\nChan, however, made a high-fashion statement with a baby-blue Bottega Veneta set. She wore a $2,500 wool cardigan, a matching $2,800 skirt, and chunky pearl necklaces.\n\nZuckerberg opted for an all-black outfit instead of a standard tuxedo. He wore a pleated button-down shirt, a matching jacket, dark trousers, shining dress shoes, and a pair of Meta AI Ray-Ban glasses, which cost between $299 and $549.\n\nChan took a bolder approach, incorporating various pieces from designer brands.\n\nShe tucked a white T-shirt into Alaïa's $11,400 black bubble skirt, draped an oversized blazer over both, and accessorized with a $2,000 Magda Butrym bag.\n\nShe also wore $1,200 lambskin and leather mules from Alaïa and a black-and-white snake necklace made from diamonds.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg wore a black tuxedo with matching dress shoes and a tie, Chan walked the event's purple carpet in a black-and-white gown.\n\nThe strapless piece had a statement bow at the waist, a pleat down its bodice, and a short cape attached to its back. She wore it with black heels and a serpent-shaped necklace covered in diamonds.\n\nTogether, the couple sat in the audience of Prada's runway show, wearing a mix of fashion staples from the Italian designer.\n\nZuckerberg's outfit included brown trousers and a tan, long-sleeved, collared shirt, while Chan's ensemble featured a thick black skirt, a gray sweater, and red socks.\n\nBoth wore chunky Prada loafers and small jewelry pieces for the fashion show.",

    "description": "The SBA's new inspector general urged Congress to give prosecutors more time to bring fraud charges related to two pandemic-era grant programs.",
    "fullText": "A top federal pandemic-aid investigator said the number of investigations into $43 billion in emergency grants to restaurants and entertainment businesses has been \"embarrassing\" and \"underwhelming.\"\n\nWilliam Kirk, the new inspector general for the Small Business Administration, urged Congress to give prosecutors more time to bring charges against people for defrauding two lesser-known pandemic aid programs: the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund and the $14.6 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant.\n\n\"There is no possible way that our office would be able to investigate all of the outstanding referrals and cases that we've received in the SVOG and the RRF program,\" he said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. \"The scope of the work is such that we would need much more time.\"\n\nBusiness Insider reported in 2023 and 2024 on hundreds of millions of dollars that flowed from SVOG to artists like Lil Wayne, Post Malone, Marshmello, and Nickelback. While those grants may have been legal under the extremely broad language passed by Congress, records showed that some artists spent their taxpayer grants on lavish parties, private jets, and multimillion-dollar bonuses for themselves.\n\nSenator Joni Ernst has pushed to extend the window for bringing charges related to SVOG and RRF fraud. Ernst previously said her Democratic counterpart, Senator Ed Markey, wasn't letting the bill advance, though Markey's comments at the hearing suggested the logjam might be breaking.\n\n\"I am committed to passing this legislation as part of a comprehensive set of reforms and look forward to working with the chair to advance it, along with other bipartisan priorities,\" Markey said. \"That said, our efforts to fight against fraud should not be limited to going after small restaurants and theaters, especially when President Trump is letting off fraudsters left and right.\"\n\nThe bill had been caught up in a larger dispute about other small-business programs that provide research funds to early-stage tech companies. Markey said in a statement that a deal had been reached to extend them for five years.\n\nKirk, who was sworn in early January, said in prepared testimony that while hundreds of complaints have poured in about potential abuse of the Shuttered Venues program, his office has six open investigations. He said that while his office's investigators and auditors are \"dedicated professionals,\" they were focused on other areas of fraud in recent years.\n\nIn response to questions from Ernst, who leads the Senate small business committee, about whether Kirk's office would have time to bring charges before time runs out in April or May, Kirk called the office's work on those programs \"underwhelming.\"\n\n\"The handful of investigations — quite honestly, it's an embarrassing number — of investigations we currently have underway, those would probably time out,\" he added.\n\nCongress has already extended the statute of limitations to charge some fraud related to the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans, two larger and better-known programs, tacking on another five years to the normal five-year window to bring charges.\n\nSome Democrats at the hearing pressed Kirk to investigate the activities of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency at the SBA.\n\nAsked by Senator Jeanne Shaheen if he was concerned about the office's activities, Kirk said, \"Not currently, no.\"",

    "title": "These $80 packable sneakers from Reef are my holy grail travel shoes",
    "description": "I'm a travel writer, so I rely on packable shoes that can go the extra mile. The Reef Neptune sneakers check all my boxes for comfort, fit, and style.",
    "fullText": "I've never been much of a sneaker gal. As someone who lives in a year-round warm-weather climate, I'm more comfortable wearing sandals. That was until I started having foot tingling and pain.\n\nEager for a solution, I looked for shoes that would provide support, but look cuter than the chunky running sneakers I wear to work out. And, as a travel writer who takes several trips a year, I needed something close-toed that would be easy to pack, comfortable while sprinting through airports, and can hold up to 20,000-step days.\n\nThe Reef Neptune sneaker ticked all my boxes. Lightweight, ultra breathable, stylish, and with incredible arch support, they've now become my everyday walking shoe. \n\nThe best part is that they pack down flat, taking up just as much room in my luggage as a pair of sandals. But they're so dreamy to wear, you're more likely to find them on my feet than stuffed into my suitcase.\n\nA lightweight sneaker made with a breathable mesh knit, this shoe has a plush memory foam sole that’s comfortable from the first wear (and hundreds of miles later).\n\nThe sneakers' crushable, fold-down heel design makes slipping them on and off a cinch. This especially comes in handy when I'm running out the door to pick up my kids or in a busy airport security line and kicking myself for forgetting to add my TSA precheck number.\n\nThe Reef Neptunes are wildly comfortable from the very first wear. The ultra-soft memory foam insole and cushioned footbed remind me more of a plush slipper than a sneaker. They took no time to break in, and I can still feel the enhanced arch support hugging the soles of my feet, even after months of regular wear.\n\nThey're an approachable style with a true-to-size fit and middle-of-the-road width. I wear a size 8 sneaker and they fit perfectly, with no tightness in the toe box. The breathable, stretchy mesh sides will surely benefit wider feet, though sizing up a half size is always an option. If your feet run narrow, Reef suggests sizing down a half size for a snugger fit.\n\nAt $80, I think they're very reasonably priced. Especially compared to similar name-brand offerings — Allbirds' Tree Runner, for example, costs $20 more. Vivaia's All Day slip-on mesh sneaker commands $159.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've owned Reef's Ginger Flip Flops since the early 2000s. I consistently find this brands' shoes to be reliably well made, durable, and long lasting.\n\nThe biggest drawback I've experienced is how easily they stain. I deliberately chose gray instead of the white for this reason, but they still became dirty pretty quickly.\n\nTo clean them, I first remove the insoles, then combine warm water with a bit of dish soap and gentle detergent so I can brush away stains with a toothbrush. I soak the laces in the same solution, and use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to remove scuff marks. Then, I stuff them with paper towels and let them air dry for 24 hours. Voila, good as new.\n\nSimply put, I've never worn a more comfortable sneaker. The fact that these shoes look good with everything, pack down ultra light, and remain comfy through miles of walking, has made them a true VIP in my closet (and suitcase).\n\nThat said, I did find it frustrating how easily they dirtied. In hindsight, I would've picked a darker color, and moving forward, I plan to clean them more regularly rather than wait for them to turn dark and dingy.\n\nStill, the Reef Neptune is a stylish, affordable option that travels well and might be as close as I'll ever come to walking on air. I'm not sure I can do much better than that.\n\nLearn how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes and accessories at Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Walmart is set to pay about $16 million to Spark drivers as part of a larger settlement over claims that it misled workers about pay and tips.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday that Walmart agreed to a $100 million settlement over claims that the big-box retailer told Spark drivers they would earn \n\nPart of the proposed settlement includes a \"driver fund\" that would distribute $16.2 million to Spark drivers whose actual pay was lower than what Walmart promised through the delivery app, according to court documents. The payouts apply to offers Walmart made to drivers as far back as January 1, 2021.\n\n\"In many instances, Walmart either failed to notify drivers at all about the change in base pay and tips or only notified them of the change in their earnings after they completed the delivery,\" the FTC said in its announcement.\n\nA Walmart spokesperson said that the retailer values \"the hard work and dedication of the drivers who deliver great service and products to our customers.\"\n\n\"We have issued payments to impacted drivers and continue to make additional payments as appropriate,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are continuously improving procedures to ensure fairness and transparency for drivers.\"\n\nLast year, Walmart sent some Spark drivers surprise tip payments, some worth hundreds of dollars each. The company said it had identified some workers who had not received full tip payments in the past and had sent the payments, including interest.\n\nWalmart \"failed to notify drivers that, unlike the payment for the goods being delivered, the payment for the advertised tip amount had not been preauthorized, and therefore drivers would not receive that amount if the customer was unable to cover the cost of the tip or if the charge otherwise failed,\" the FTC said.\n\nWalmart also sometimes split a customer's tip across multiple drivers when filling an order that required multiple deliveries — a practice it also failed to tell drivers about, the FTC's complaint said.\n\nOther companies that rely on gig workers for deliveries have also faced charges that they failed to pay out tips.\n\nLast year, for example, DoorDash agreed to pay $16.75 million to 60,000 of its delivery workers in New York state to settle claims that the service used tips to offset workers' base pay.\n\nDo you work for Spark or another delivery service?

    "fullText": "In 10 years, there might not be many jobs, but there sure will be a lot of spin bikes. (At least, if you believe this ad.)\n\nThe Belgian AI startup AiCandy released a new advertisement for their company, mocking AI's skyrocketing demand for energy. It imagines a 2036 in which humans now power AI through group workouts — and features AI-aged versions of Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe video is a spoof ad for a company called \"Energym,\" which uses human cycling and rowing classes to generate the energy needed for AI.\n\n\"What if we could use the energy of humans to power the machines that took away their jobs,\" AI Musk said.\n\nA post shared by AiCandy (@aicandy.be)\n\nIt's a doomsday scenario, of course. (It's not clear that any AI job apocalypse is coming soon.) But it's one that resonated: The Instagram Reel has over 4 million views, while accounts continue to repost it on X, including one with nearly 2 million views.\n\n\"Doesn't feel like a parody of anything really,\" Sen. Chris Murphy wrote.\n\nAiCandy's Hans Buyse isn't such a fan of those reposts: \"They're making profit off of it,\" he said.\n\nBuyse and his cofounder, Jan De Loore, told Business Insider that they were thrilled with the reach of their videos. They expected some virality, but not the millions of views it would bring to their account.\n\nThe duo founded their AI video company in 2025. Buyse spent two decades working in commercials. De Loore is a motion designer and paints on the side. He has started using AI to model his paintings.\n\nInitially, clients gave them lots of pushback. Their feedback was mainly that \"it's polluting, it's consuming so much energy,\" De Loore said. Buyse then came up with the idea of making a video to showcase clean, human-made energy.\n\nThe idea was back-burnered until a couple of weeks ago, when De Loore thought to bring it back and frame it around aged US tech moguls.\n\n\"It's a combination also with the fitness hype, and young men that don't know what to do anymore with their lives,\" Buyse said. \"It's all coming together in one 40-second video.\"\n\nThe founders said they now have an inbox filled with collaboration requests. The Dor Brothers, a popular AI video production company, offered them a job, Buyse said.\n\nStill, they're holding out for one email in particular.\n\n\"We're just awaiting Elon,\" De Loore said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge said Thursday that the IRS broke the law by disclosing confidential taxpayer information “approximately 42,695 times\" to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly found that the IRS had erroneously shared the taxpayer information of thousands of people with the Department of Homeland Security as part of the agencies’ controversial agreement to share information on immigrants for the purpose of identifying and deporting people illegally in the U.S.\n\nHer finding was based off a declaration filed earlier this month by Dottie Romo, IRS’ chief risk and control officer, which revealed that the IRS had provided DHS with information on 47,000 of the 1.28 million people that ICE requested — and, in most of those cases, gave ICE additional address information in violation of privacy rules created to protect taxpayer data.\n\nKollar-Kotelly said in her Thursday decision that the agency violated IRS Code 6103, one of the strictest confidentiality laws in federal statute, “approximately 42,695 times by disclosing last known taxpayer addresses to ICE.” She called the Romo declaration “a significant development in this case.”\n\n“The IRS not only failed to ensure that ICE’s request for confidential taxpayer address information met the statutory requirements, but this failure led the IRS to disclose confidential taxpayer addresses to ICE in situations where ICE’s request for that information was patently deficient,\" she wrote.\n\nThe government is appealing the case, but the Thursday ruling is significant because Romo's declaration supports the decision on appeal.\n\nNina Olson, founder of the Center for Taxpayer Rights, which has sued the government over the disclosure, says “this confirms what we’ve been saying all along: that the IRS has an unlawful policy that violates the Internal Revenue Code’s protections by releasing these addresses in a way that violates the law’s requirements.”\n\nRepresentatives from the IRS and Treasury Department did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.\n\nA data-sharing agreement signed last April by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem allows ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records. The deal led the then-acting commissioner of the IRS to resign.\n\nThere are several ongoing cases that challenge the IRS-DHS agreement.\n\nEarlier this week, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declined to issue a preliminary injunction for the immigrants’ rights group, Centro de Trabajadores Unidos, and other nonprofits that are suing the federal government to stop implementation of the agreement.\n\nIn declining the preliminary injunction request, Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that the nonprofit groups “are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim,” since the information the agencies are sharing isn’t covered by the IRS privacy statute.\n\nStill, two separate court orders have blocked the agencies from massive transfers of taxpayer information and blocked ICE from acting upon any IRS data in its possession. Those preliminary injunctions are still in place.",

    "description": "At first, I worried that living at home as an adult meant a failure to launch. After my dad died and I began navigating grief, my perspective changed.",
    "fullText": "Growing up, when I imagined my 20s, I pictured living in a huge city apartment on my own, with a partner or a quirky group of roommates. I'd decorate my home with chic art pieces, paint the walls a dusty rose, and host dinner parties for my friends.\n\nI was desperate to begin my life. I thought adulthood started when you moved out; anything else felt like going backward.\n\nThen, my dad died, and my entire reality shifted.\n\nLiving with family as an adult is often framed as a \"failure to launch,\" but navigating grief at home with my mom and younger sister helped me rethink growth.\n\nAfter I finished college at 22, I moved in with my parents while I figured out what my long-term plan would be.\n\nI hoped this would be a very brief stint. Impatient to be more \"independent\" and worried I was falling behind my peers, I vowed to rent an apartment with my boyfriend as soon as we could afford one.\n\nBefore I had a chance to move out, though, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed us into a lockdown. I settled back into living with my family until further notice. There were practical benefits, such as saving money, but I still felt restless.\n\nIn ways, I reverted back to a teenager: whispering on FaceTime, sending messages on Snapchat, even sneaking out of my window to meet up with my partner after everyone had gone to sleep. At 22, I felt emotionally crowded and missed the freedom I'd experienced at college.\n\nMore than a loss of privacy, though, I was ashamed that I was still \"waiting\" to reach what I saw as the first big marker of adulthood.\n\nFour years after I moved back home, my dad suddenly passed away.\n\nWe couldn't properly say goodbye. Instead, we sat in fear for months. His chair was empty, leaving a hole in our home.\n\nAs guilty as I felt for not always appreciating the years I'd spent with him, I realized how lucky I was to have gotten to spend his last few years at home with him.\n\nMany fathers who get to grow old may never spend as much time with their children as I did with mine, precisely because I stayed home.\n\nMy dad had moved out of his house at a young age and lived in four countries. In one of our last one-on-one conversations, shortly before he was admitted into the hospital, he told me how everyone keeps moving to find their place, but everywhere is virtually the same. The main difference is the people that you're leaving behind.\n\nLooking back, those extra years at home were convenient, yes, but they were also the happiest I've ever been. Now, having my mom and sister by my side gives us space to grieve together and mutually support each other.\n\nAs a very tight-knit family, we built our life around traditions, from holidays and vacations to sports and movie nights.\n\nMy dad's favorite activity was spending time with us. He taught us skills like skiing, languages, and playing tennis.\n\nHealing came from returning to the traditions he loved. Although it was challenging at first, we forced ourselves to engage with his hobbies and rituals, reliving our memories together. We cooked his favorite food, sang songs he loved, and played lots of tennis.\n\nWith time, the sadness became more tolerable as we created new rituals while preserving treasured old ones.\n\nThis wasn't the \"20-something\" life I had envisioned, but this version of home became a symbol of my growth precisely because of how much I loved my past. I realized that living at home at 27 isn't a lack of maturity or a so-called \"failure to launch.\"\n\nIf anything, grief sharpened my sense of responsibility. Adulthood can be communal, and I feel lucky to have familial support. Grief has made living with my family more meaningful, grounding, and empowering than ever.",

    "fullText": "\"Happy Birthday!\" texts, emails, or social media posts don't quite have the same pizzazz as opening up a physical card in the mail.\n\nCousins Andrew Gold and Aaron Albert want to revive the art of mailing greeting cards for Gen Z and millennials with their startup Escargot.\n\n\"People want to feel human,\" Albert told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nLaunched in February, Escargot lets people send physical greeting cards for any occasion — birthdays, holidays, congratulations — all within its mobile app or website. Individual cards cost about $8, while subscriptions start at about $10 a month for two card credits that roll over.\n\nThe startup recently raised $2.75 million in seed funding from investors like Wischoff Ventures, Hannah Grey, and South Park Commons.\n\n\"This greeting card industry is massive,\" Gold said. Grand View Research estimated that the US card market was about $7.1 billion in 2025.\n\nGold said that most of the birthdays in the app are after 2000.\n\n\"That's where we have a big, fertile opportunity,\" Gold said. \"But we also are interested in marketing towards millennials and up as well.\"\n\nWhile AI has taken over the internet and social media has evolved to feel less social, there's also been a resurgence of analog media: landlines, photo booths, record players.\n\nThis \"cultural shift,\" Albert said, signaled to Escargot's founders that now was a good moment to launch a product centered on nostalgia for paper goods as a foil to the futuristic tech coming out of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"We're not Luddites,\" Albert said. \"We're not going to poo-poo tech.\"\n\nInstead, Escargot's founders plan to leverage tech and AI to return to a more social version of the web.\n\n\"We are not going out pitching ourselves as an AI company,\" Gold said. \"We are going to use it in interesting ways to power some of the experiences.\"\n\nGold, Escargot's CEO, previously worked at Apple and Coinbase, while Albert, Escargot's CMO, is a former child actor and the founder of mental health startup Felt.\n\nEscargot uses AI in a couple of ways.\n\nIf the available art doesn't suit the message you're trying to convey, Escargot offers the option to \"remix\" the card art with AI using Google's Gemini. Users can upload their own photos to the card, as well.\n\nThe app also uses AI to recommend moments to send cards to your friends if you give it access to your calendar and contacts.\n\nEscargot isn't the only one betting on the space. Hallmark, one of the leading greeting card incumbents, has an app that lets you send paper cards and reminders.\n\nIn its pitch to investors, Escargot emphasized that the company plans to expand beyond greeting cards with features that offer a twist on gift cards and more ways to keep people connected.\n\nEscargot is one of several AI-era startups that pitch users with tools to build stronger relationships in the real world. Retro, a photo-sharing social media platform, has a postcard feature that makes sending photos to friends and family as easy as posting online. There's also Rodeo, founded by former Hinge executives, which is using AI to streamline the process of getting together IRL with friends.\n\nEscargot has five full-time employees, including Gold and Albert, and plans to deploy its recent funding by building out its product ecosystem.\n\nRead the Notion memo Escargot used to pitch investors, shared exclusively with Business Insider.\n\nNote: Some details have been redacted.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Diving World Cup scheduled in Mexico next week was canceled due to safety concerns on Thursday.\n\nThe meet was to take place from March 5-8 in Zapopan, near Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco, where there has been a surge in violence since Sunday following the capture and death of the leader of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), Nemesio Oseguera.\n\n“A thorough risk assessment of the situation included consideration of travel restrictions and advice given by a number of international governments regarding travel to Mexico at the current time,” World Aquatics said in a statement. “The safety and participation of all athletes remain a fundamental priority for World Aquatics.”\n\nMexican sports officials were yet to comment on the cancellation.\n\nCartel members have burned cars and blocked roads in nearly a dozen Mexican states and authorities report that at least 70 people have died. The CJNG is considered the most powerful and violent cartel in Mexico and it is centered in Jalisco state.\n\nEven though Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has said things are getting back to normal, in Guadalajara there was still fear among its citizens.\n\nFour high-level soccer matches were postponed last Sunday, including one in the central city of Queretaro, where Mexico defeated Iceland 4-0 on Wednesday in a friendly. Top-tier team Atlas held workouts through Zoom.\n\nOn Wednesday, four softballers from the Guadalajara-based Jalisco Charros of the Women's Professional League asked to be released from the team for “personal reasons.” They were American Nicola Simpson, Canadians Natalie Wildman and Janet Lung and Dutch player Eva Voortman.\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports",

    "fullText": "Update: Shortly after this story was published, Netflix announced that it would not raise its bid for WBD.\n\nParamount Skydance may finally have the upper hand on Netflix in the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe WBD board announced on Thursday afternoon that it believes Paramount's improved offer to buy the entire company for $31 per share is better than Netflix's proposal to buy its streaming and studio assets for $27.75 per share. Both offers are all cash.\n\nParamount's bid also includes a so-called \"ticking fee,\" which will pay WBD shareholders $0.25 per share, or about $650 million, for every quarter that its deal doesn't get regulatory approval, starting September 30.\n\nNetflix now has four business days to raise its bid, if it chooses. It could also decide to walk away and collect a $2.8 billion breakup fee from WBD, which Paramount has said it will cover.\n\n\"While Netflix has the opportunity to increase its bid and reclaim WBD, the bigger question is if it's in Netflix's interest to continue pursuit,\" said Ross Benes, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. \"Netflix and Paramount stocks have taken a hit since this bidding war started. Investors will not be keen on increasing bids further.\"\n\nIf Netflix doesn't improve its offer, WBD's board will formally change its recommendation and kill its Netflix deal. WBD shareholders will vote on March 20 to approve the transaction with the highest bidder.\n\nParamount and Netflix have each been on a mission to convince Hollywood, consumers, and government officials that they'd be the better buyer of Warner Bros.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount is willing to pay WBD a $7 billion breakup fee if its deal is blocked by regulators, a sign of his confidence in winning over the US Department of Justice under President Donald Trump. (Netflix has agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if regulators blocked its deal.) Ellison would also need regulatory approval in Europe and could face challenges at the state level in the US.\n\nParamount has warned that Netflix would become an overpowering juggernaut if it bought HBO and the Warner Bros. studio. Netflix has argued that it competes with YouTube and traditional TV, not just paid streamers.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has been on a charm offensive, telling politicians, the creative community, and the public that Netflix would create jobs if it bought Warner Bros. Sarandos visited the White House this week, Politico reported.\n\nTrump said earlier this month he'd stay out of the process, though he said in December that Netflix's market share \"could be a problem.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nTrump, however, said shortly after that Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board and would otherwise \"pay the consequences.\" Rice, who worked in the White House under Obama and Biden, was critical of Trump on a podcast and said companies that bow to him could face retribution. Sarandos downplayed Trump's comments, saying that the company's plan to buy Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"\n\nParamount has promised investors $6 billion in savings if it wins the bidding war, compared to Netflix's target of $2 billion to $3 billion. WBD's board, as recently as last week, expressed concern that could lead to an employee exodus if Paramount won control of the company.",

    "description": "The Washington Post reported that activists are working with the White House on an executive order to declare a \"national emergency\" over America's elections.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump gestures after speaking to soldiers and their families at Fort Bragg, N.C., Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. \n\nThe Washington Post reported that activists are working with the White House on an executive order to declare a “national emergency” over America’s elections and pave the way for a power grab.\n\n“Pro-Trump activists who say they are in coordination with the White House are circulating a 17-page draft executive order that claims China interfered in the 2020 election as a basis to declare a national emergency that would unlock extraordinary presidential power over voting,” reported the Post‘s Isaac Arnsdorf. “President Donald Trump has repeatedly previewed a plan to mandate voter ID and ban mail ballots in November’s midterm elections, and the activists expect their draft will figure into Trump’s promised executive order on the issue.”\n\nPeter Ticktin, a MAGA activist in favor of the executive order, told the Post that “we have a situation where the president is aware that there are foreign interests that are interfering in our election processes,” and that “the president has to be able to deal with it,” including by banning mail-in ballots and certain voting machines.\n\n“If there was a provable foreign intrusion, that would be a national security emergency and the order could be issued under his powers as commander in chief,” added Jerome Corsi, another activist lobbying on behalf of the executive order.\n\nTrump has long alleged that the country’s elections are “rigged,” most notably after his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, when his false claims culminated in a violent riot at the Capitol Building.\n\nTrump told Dan Bongino, the conservative commentator and former deputy director of the FBI, that “The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting in at least 15 places'” earlier this month.\n\n“The Republicans oughta nationalize the voting,” he added.\n\nTrump previously promised to act unilaterally if Congress failed to pass a bill mandating voter I.D.\n\n“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS. They have all sorts of reasons why it shouldn’t be passed, and then boldly laugh in the backrooms after their ridiculous presentations. If it weren’t such a serious matter, it would be considered a TOTAL JOKE! No Voter I.D. is even crazier, and more ridiculous, than Men playing in Women’s Sports, Open Borders, or Transgender for Everyone. Republicans must put this at the top of every speech — It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND! Even Democrat Voters agree, 85%, that there should be Voter I.D. It’s only the Political ‘Leaders,’ Crooked Losers like Schumer and Jeffries, that have no shame, and explain why it’s “racist,” and every other thing that they can think of,” wrote the president in a February 13 Truth Social post. “This is an issue that must be fought, and must be fought, NOW! If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.”\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Mulling Plan to Declare ‘National Emergency’ Paving Way for Major Power Grab first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Hillary Clinton on Thursday said she has no knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and urged lawmakers to focus their energies on other people associated with the convicted sex offender, including Elon Musk.\n\nIn a combative four-page opening statement, the former secretary of state blasted the House Oversight Committee for calling her to testify as part of their probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The well-connected financier died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial.\n\nClinton on Thursday called the committee's probe \"partisan political theatre,\" saying she doesn't recall ever having met Epstein.\n\n\"I do not recall ever encountering Mr. Epstein. I never flew on his plane or visited his island, homes, or offices,\" she said.\n\nHere is my opening statement to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today. pic.twitter.com/NZSF2epcI5\n\nShe proceeded to rip into the committee's members, accusing them of not doing more to end human trafficking or seek justice for Epstein's victims.\n\n\"A committee endeavoring to stop human trafficking would seek to understand what specific steps are needed to fix a system that allowed Epstein to get away with his crimes in 2008,\" she said.\n\n\"It would ensure that the lawful reductions of those files protected the victims and survivors, not powerful men in political allies,\" she added.\n\n\"It would subpoena anyone who asked on which night there would be the 'wildest party' on Epstein Island,\" she said in a not-so-veiled reference to Musk.\n\nEmails released by the Department of Justice on January 30 showed Musk asking that very question while discussing plans to visit Epstein's Caribbean island in 2012.\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked in the November 2012 email chain.\n\nThe question was in response to an email from Epstein offering to send a helicopter to whisk the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to his private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"how many people will you be for the heli to island,\" Epstein asked Musk in an email exchange. Musk said he'd need just two seats — for himself and his then-partner, Tallulah Riley.\n\nThe DOJ's files have not revealed any communications suggesting that Musk knew about Epstein's crimes. Musk has denied visiting the island. A representative for the Tesla CEO didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nClinton's husband, former President of the United States Bill Clinton, has been prominently featured in the DOJ's Epstein files, including numerous photos of the two men together.\n\nBill Clinton is expected to testify before the committee in Chappaqua, NY, where the Clintons live, on Friday. He has previously said he travelled on Epstein's plane four times, in 2002 and 2003, while on trips for the Clinton Foundation.\n\nHillary Clinton has previously acknowledged a relationship with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for participating in Epstein's trafficking of young women.\n\nOn Thursday, she said she had no knowledge of Maxwell's crimes.\n\n\"The committee justified its subpoena to me, based on its assumptions that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" she said. \"Let me be as clear as I can. I do not.\"",

    "description": "Netflix said it wouldn't pay more for Warner Bros., and the deal was \"no longer financially attractive,\" two days after Paramount increased its offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has won the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNetflix said Thursday it won't raise its bid, paving the way for Paramount to buy WBD and become a Hollywood behemoth.\n\nThe decision comes two days after Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share for all of WBD, including its cable networks like CNN and HGTV. WBD's board said Thursday that Paramount's latest offer was better than Netflix's proposal to buy its streaming and studio assets — including Warner Bros. and HBO Max — for $27.75 per share.\n\n\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.\"\n\nNetflix will now pocket a $2.8 billion breakup fee paid by WBD, which Paramount has said it will reimburse.\n\nNetflix investors seem thrilled. The stock surged by more than 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Paramount shares jumped about 5%.\n\nWBD shares slipped 1.8%, a potential sign that shareholders were counting on an even bigger bidding war.\n\nA combination of Paramount and WBD could create a true rival to Hollywood leaders Netflix and Disney. However, despite its size, it would still face the daunting task of transitioning legacy media assets — including declining cable TV networks — to a new era dominated by streaming and social media.\n\n\"We are excited about the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can't wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world,\" WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a statement.\n\nEllison has relentlessly pursued WBD for months, making 10 official offers for the company. His pursuit of WBD has been backed by his father, Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of cloud giant Oracle.\n\nParamount already owns its iconic movie studio, Paramount+, CBS, and TV networks like MTV and Comedy Central.\n\nIf Paramount's WBD deal secures regulatory approvals, it will get the Warner Bros. studio, HBO, HBO Max, and cable networks like CNN, TNT, and HGTV, plus the Discovery+ streaming service.\n\nThough the combination would make Ellison a Hollywood heavyweight, his company would still fall behind Netflix in a few key metrics.\n\nHBO Max had 131.6 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter, while Paramount+ had 78.9 million paid subscribers as of late 2025.\n\nNetflix crossed 325 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nWBD's streaming services accounted for 1.4% TV share on US TVs in January, according to Nielsen, compared to 2.3% for Paramount's streamers. For comparison, Netflix was at 8.8% while Disney's streamers got 4.9%.\n\nOne side plot is that CNN may soon find itself with the same corporate parent as CBS News, which Ellison has begun to remake by installing the polarizing Bari Weiss as its editor in chief.\n\nParamount has framed itself as a better buyer for WBD than Netflix, which it said would wield unhealthy sway over competitors and consumers if it bought HBO and gained access to iconic IP like DC Comics' Batman.\n\nNetflix argued that it would be a better caretaker of Warner Bros. by laying off fewer staffers than Paramount would, while creating TV jobs in a Hollywood plagued by fewer productions. Paramount has promised investors $6 billion in cost savings from the deal.\n\nBoth Netflix and Paramount have angled for support from regulators and President Donald Trump. Paramount is willing to pay WBD a $7 billion breakup fee if its deal is blocked, a sign of Ellison's confidence in regulatory approval.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider in mid-February that Trump had \"great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference\" for Netflix or Paramount.\n\nHowever, Netflix caught Trump's ire days later, with the president saying that the streaming giant must remove board member Susan Rice \"or pay the consequences.\" Rice, a White House official during the Obama and Biden administrations, appeared on a podcast and criticized Trump and companies she believes chose to \"take a knee\" to the president.\n\nSarandos previously downplayed Trump's comments, saying the Netflix-Warner Bros. tie-up is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "description": "Mickey Barreto booked a one-night stay at the New Yorker Hotel in 2018, then stayed on, rent-free, for five years. Now he might go to jail.",
    "fullText": "A man who lived in the iconic New Yorker Hotel for half a decade without paying a single cent in rent has been sentenced to jail.\n\nPolice arrested Mickey Barreto in February 2024 and charged him with filing fraudulent property records after he attempted to claim ownership of the hotel, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.\n\nProsecutors said Barreto skirted thousands of dollars worth of rent payments by exploiting a little-known local housing law, and then attempted to charge another tenant in the building rent.\n\n“As alleged, Mickey Barreto repeatedly and fraudulently claimed ownership of one of the City’s most iconic landmarks, the New Yorker Hotel,” Alvin Bragg, Manhattan's district attorney, said in a statement in 2024.\n\nBarreto faced 24 charges, including 14 felony fraud counts, The New York Times reported. In February 2026, he pled guilty to a felony count of filing a false instrument and was sentenced to six months in jail and five years of post-release probation.\n\nBarreto's residency at the renowned hotel — which in its heyday hosted many dignitaries and celebrities, including Muhammad Ali and John F. Kennedy — dates back to 2018 when he first learned about New York City's Rent Stabilization Code. This law grants tenants living in individual rooms in buildings built before 1969 the right to request a six-month lease.\n\nIn June 2018, Barreto checked into room 2565 with his partner, Matthew Hannan, for one night and was charged $200.57.\n\nThe following day, Barreto requested a six-month lease from the hotel and was promptly evicted.\n\nBarreto — a California transplant with a penchant for conspiracy theories who also claims to be the leader of a tribal community he founded in Brazil, according to The New York Times — refused to take no for an answer.\n\nThat July, he took the building's owner, the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, to housing court, claiming he was illegally evicted. A representative for the church didn't show up, so the judge sided with Barreto, and the hotel had to give him the key.\n\nThe two parties never agreed on lease terms, and because he couldn't be evicted, Barreto lived at the hotel rent-free.\n\nSoon, Barreto began portraying himself as the hotel's owner and eventually demanded rent from one of the building's tenants, the TickTock diner.\n\nThe DA's office said that Barreto also registered the hotel under his name with the city's Department of Environmental Protection as part of an effort to gain control of the hotel’s bank accounts.\n\nThe Unification Church, which bought the New Yorker in 1976, sued Barreto for representing himself as the hotel's owner on LinkedIn and uploading a forged deed to a city website. Barreto was ordered by a judge to stop asserting that he owned the building, but he continued to live there.\n\nIn 2023, Barreto again filed papers with the city claiming to be the building's owner, and that's when the district attorney's office stepped in.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to Barreto through his company, Mickey Barreto Missions, in 2024, but didn't receive a response before publication.\n\n“I never intended to commit any fraud. I don’t believe I ever committed any fraud,” Barreto told The Associated Press. “And I never made a penny out of this.”\n\nWhen asked for a comment by Business Insider, the New York City Police Department directed questions to the district attorney's office.\n\nCorrection: April 12, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated details about the legal claims filed by Barreto and the building's owner. Barreto initially took the building owner to housing court for being illegally evicted, and a judge sided with him because a representative for the owner did not appear in court. That case did not go before the state Supreme Court and there was no appeal filed. The story has also been updated to clarify some details about the chronology of the legal disputes between the two parties.",

    "description": "Going viral brought new customers, but didn't guarantee customer retention. The Chocbox founder shares how's she's building a lasting business.",
    "fullText": "For years, Brittany Nemandoust struggled to keep her small business afloat.\n\nChocbox, her DIY chocolate-making kit company, started as a pandemic project after shutdowns left her temporarily out of work as a dental hygienist. When she returned to the dental office, the business remained a side hustle.\n\nSales fluctuated, spiking over the holidays and slowing down during the spring and summer.\n\nAround April 2024, she and her husband, Kevin, sat down to discuss whether it was time to shut it down. Sales weren't enough to cover expenses, including rent for a small office in Los Angeles and payroll for a part-time employee, and Nemandoust had taken on credit-card debt to keep the company running.\n\nOn paper, closing made sense. But she wasn't ready to give it up.\n\n\"I was really optimistic. I'm like, 'I know that it's going to happen at some point. It's going to blow up,'\" she told Business Insider. \"I just had a feeling.\"\n\nA few weeks later, an opportunity emerged. Nemandoust had noticed videos of a thick, pistachio-filled \"Dubai chocolate\" bar flooding TikTok. Influencers were trying to recreate it at home, and comment sections were filled with the same questions: Where do you get these ingredients? How do you make this?\n\nUnlike most viewers, she already ran a chocolate kit business. Plus, years earlier, she had custom-designed a chocolate mold that was 20-30% thicker than standard molds — originally, she said, because she felt customers deserved a more substantial bar. That thickness turned out to be exactly what the viral Dubai bar required.\n\nThe couple went to a Middle Eastern grocery store in their neighborhood, bought pistachio cream and kataifi pastry, and tested their own version. Then, they filmed a video of the two of them breaking the bar in half and tasting it.\n\n\"It wasn't a pretty video. It was just very raw,\" she said, but the response was immediate.\n\nWithin 20 minutes, the video had 500 views, more than her videos typically received. Minutes later, the count doubled. By the end of the day, more than 100,000 people had viewed the video, and orders were pouring in. She hit TikTok's daily cap for new sellers, 100 orders, that day and again the next.\n\nThere was just one problem: She didn't have hundreds of kits ready to ship.\n\nGoing viral was exhilarating, but chaotic.\n\nTwo ingredients in particular — kataifi and pistachio cream — were difficult to source. Online suppliers were sold out, so she and Kevin started calling Turkish markets across Los Angeles. They even phoned gelato shops, knowing pistachio cream is often used in pistachio ice cream.\n\nThey also needed extra hands to pack orders, so they called friends, family, and anyone willing to pack boxes at odd hours.\n\n\"When you go viral, you need it now,\" Nemandoust said. \"You don't have time to go through a hiring process or wait a week for a bulk order of items. You need it ASAP.\"\n\nIn addition to pulling from every resource they had, they worked 15-hour days, waking up around 6 a.m. and finishing late at night. They often livestreamed their long days, which helped build their community that would be integral to sustained success.\n\n\"We would be up and just livestream at like 11 pm at night, blasting music, and I honestly think that's how we started building our community — showing people the rawness of what it means to go viral,\" she said.\n\nAs chaotic as that time was, the couple still focused on building systems to keep up with demand. They created instructions for assembling a kit, for how it should look when complete, and for packaging and labeling it correctly. They printed photos of finished kits and taped them to the walls, and recorded short videos demonstrating the packing process so new helpers and employees could avoid mistakes.\n\n\"The worst thing you can do when you go viral is not fulfill orders,\" Kevin, who quit his corporate job in 2025 to help grow Chocbox, said. \"People are dying for your product, and if you don't send it, that can almost instantly kill your momentum.\"\n\nThey also resisted the temptation to assume the viral spike would last forever. Instead, they focused on turning a moment into infrastructure: improving sourcing, tightening operations, and gradually expanding capacity. They moved from a 5-by-6-foot cubicle to larger office spaces in the same building, eventually upgrading to a 6,000-square-foot warehouse. Today, they employ eight people.\n\nGoing viral brought new customers, but didn't guarantee customer retention. To create a lasting business, they've focused on building a community and creating the best possible product.\n\nFrom the start, Nemandoust leaned into community-building. She livestreamed on TikTok, assembling kits in real time, answering questions, and interacting directly with viewers.\n\n\"I want people to think of me when they think of Chocbox,\" she said. \"I want to be part of the brand.\"\n\nThe livestreams weren't just sales channels. They became a means of building trust. Customers watched orders being packed, saw the behind-the-scenes scramble, and felt included in the growth.\n\nAffiliates became another key pillar. TikTok's native affiliate system allowed creators to tag Chocbox products in their videos and earn commissions. At first, influencers were simply buying the kits themselves and posting about them. Over time, the couple built a more intentional network of roughly 30 highly engaged affiliates, whom they call \"Chocboxers.\"\n\n\"We invest in them, and they invest in us,\" Kevin said, noting that some of their affiliates earn thousands of dollars a month in commission. \"They're an extension of our brand.\"\n\nBeyond community, they've maintained discipline in their product strategy and kept a tight focus on a hero product: the chocolate-making kit. They later added refill kits and a jarred version of their pistachio filling, branded as \"Dubai Dip,\" but resisted flooding their website with dozens of flavors.\n\n\"When we release products, they have to be really good,\" Nemandoust said. \"It's never going to be mediocre.\"\n\nThey're constantly engaging with their customers, asking them what they want and using that feedback to create products that excite their community.\n\nToday, both Brittany and Kevin work on Chocbox full time. Sales still fluctuate seasonally — peaking during the holidays and around Valentine's Day, slowing in summer — and growth still comes with stress, but the conversation they had in April 2024 feels distant now.\n\nThey said the company recently surpassed 300,000 units sold on TikTok Shop. Just a couple of years ago, they were preparing to shut Chocbox down. From the outside, the milestone looks like an overnight success. It's anything but, said Kevin: \"If people really knew how hard it was behind the scenes, the amount of turbulence it took to get here is insane.\"\n\nThat turbulence, the couple says, is the part most aspiring founders don't see. At the end of the day, starting and maintaining a small business is \"really hard,\" he said. But if you want to do it, \"the only thing getting in the way of starting a business is truly yourself. Just start.\"",

    "fullText": "Block CEO Jack Dorsey issued a warning about the impact of AI on employment, particularly for other companies\n\nAfter announcing he's cutting about 40% of Block's 11,000 employees, Dorsey outlined Block's next phase as a \"smaller, faster, intelligence-native company\" in his opening remarks during the company's earnings call on Thursday.\n\n\"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late,\" he said.\n\nAI, he said, is dramatically accelerating work inside Block.\n\n\"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every single week,\" Dorsey said\n\nDorsey pointed to a sharp jump in AI capabilities late last year, surpassing Block's own internal tool, Goose, which it uses to speed up coding and other repetitive work.\n\n\"Something happened in December last year where the models just got an order of magnitude more capable and more intelligent,\" he said.\n\nDorsey predicted more companies will follow suit, using AI to drive efficiency gains. Block, he said, is moving ahead of a trend that \"all companies will eventually\" embrace.\n\nThe Bay Area tech company, which owns Square, Cash App, and Tidal, had \"a lot of duplication\" that needed to be streamlined, Dorsey said.\n\nBlock CFO Amrita Ahuja said that at Block, engineering work that would have taken weeks now takes a fraction of the time thanks to AI coding tools.\n\nOutput per engineer is up by more than 40% since September, she added.\n\nAlthough Block is shedding over 4,000 people from its 10,000-strong workforce, it's expanding in one area — senior engineering talent focused on AI, Ahuja said.",

    "fullText": "A 1996 Dodge Viper RT/10 that sat atop a 30-foot pole outside Audubon Chrysler in Kentucky for nearly 28 years was recently brought down for inspection and restoration, revealing unexpected deterioration inside the vehicle. The car, first hoisted into the air in May 1996 as part of a marketing display, had become a local landmark and had only been lowered once before, in 2009.\n\nThe dealership originally elevated the Viper as a promotional move, using the bright red sports car as a highly visible attraction instead of placing it on the sales lot. The vehicle, showing just 12 original miles on the odometer, remained mounted high above the property for decades. In November 2024, marking 15 years since its last refurbishment, the dealership arranged for the car to be taken down again for evaluation. Images shared by a local resident documented the removal process and indicated that restoration efforts would be more extensive than initially expected.\n\nUpon inspection, the Viper showed significant wear from prolonged exposure. The paint had deteriorated, and the interior was found to contain mold. An entire bird’s nest had developed inside the engine bay. Despite speculation over the years that the elevated car might have been a replica or shell, the dealership confirmed it was a complete, authentic Viper.\n\nThe vehicle was transported to Keen’s Auto Body and Paint for refinishing work, including a full repaint of its red exterior. The restoration aimed to return the car to its original appearance while preserving its status as a recognizable feature of the dealership.\n\nFollowing the refurbishment, the Dodge Viper has been restored to display condition, maintaining its role as a longstanding visual fixture associated with the dealership since 1996.\n\nVia Viper Club of America/Facebook",

    "fullText": "Thinking Machines Lab, the high-profile startup run by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, has lost two more founding members to Meta.\n\nThe pair are the latest in a string of recent departures for Thinking Machines Lab, which raised a huge $2 billion round of financing at a $12 billion valuation last year. The startup, based in San Francisco and focused on helping developers custom-build AI models, has faced a wave of poaching by bigger tech and AI companies, namely Meta and OpenAI.\n\nChristian Gibson and Noah Shpak are both listed as members of Thinking Machines Lab's founding team on an earlier version of its website. Both have been working at Meta for a few weeks, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nGibson is a former OpenAI engineer who specializes in supercomputers used for training AI models and who worked on the first ChatGPT model.\n\nShpak is an AI-focused engineer who previously worked at the startup Character.AI and at X (then known as Twitter).\n\nAnother Thinking Machines Lab cofounder, Andrew Tulloch, left for Meta last year. Last month, it lost its CTO, Barret Zoph, and Luke Metz, both cofounders, to OpenAI, along with two researchers. Thinking Machines Lab also lost Jolene Parish, a founding member who specializes in security, Business Insider reported.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has become known for attracting top AI talent. It quietly hired Neal Wu, a coder who won three gold medals in an Olympiad for programming, and Soumith Chintala, the creator of the open-source AI project PyTorch at Meta, who is now its CTO, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nMeta and Thinking Machines Lab declined to comment.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Garmin Just Added the Gear-Tracking Features I've Been Dying For",
    "description": "Finally, my trail runs can default to my trail shoes!",
    "fullText": "If you track your runs (and bike rides, and all your other exercise) with a Garmin device, you’ve probably already found its gear tracking features. This is how I realized I'd put over 1,000 miles on my favorite Nikes.\n\nUntil recently, the usefulness stopped there. But in a new (free) update, Garmin has introduced a ton of new gear tracking features, including one I’ve been hoping for ever since I bought my first pair of trail shoes.\n\nNow, gear tracking isn’t just for shoes. If you ride a bike, you can now count your bike as a piece of gear, or even individual components of your bike, like the frame or the tires. Other now trackable types of gear include skis, surfboards, boots, boats, skates, and wheelchairs. These new tracking features can be found in the Garmin Connect phone app that came out alongside a software update for several Garmin watches.\n\nGarmin Connect (the phone app that syncs with your Garmin watch or other device) has a revamped set of features for the Gear section, which you’ll find under the More menu in the bottom right corner of the app.\n\nA database of existing brands and models\n\nAutomatic gear tracking is more detailed\n\nYou can create “collections” of gear that are used together\n\nGear stats are now viewable from your watch\n\nThere’s a small thing I missed when I switched from Coros back to Garmin last year: In the Coros app, I was able to designate a default shoe for my regular runs, and a different default shoe for trail runs. Garmin used to only allow you to have one default running shoe.\n\nThe new update delivers similar functionality to my Garmin, alongside a lot more detail. You can now choose to automatically add a given gear item to any activity your watch can track. For example, I can still set a shoe to be added automatically to “all Running” and that will be the same behavior as before. But I can also set my beloved (muddy, ripped-up, long-suffering) trail shoes as the default for trail running, and my nice new Nike Downshifters (1,000 mile target) as the default for the regular “run” activity. If I had a shoe I kept in my gym bag for the treadmill, I could set a separate default for treadmill runs as well.\n\nGarmin now offers “collections” of gear that you use together. For a bike, you could combine your favorite tires, frame, and so on. Just as you can add individual items automatically to certain activity types, you can also assign a collection as the default for an activity. For example, a collection that includes your jogging stroller and your street running shoes could be automatically added to all your street running activities.\n\nSo far there's no overall gear viewer on the watch (I was hoping for a glance) but you can see your gear options under the activities. Select an activity—say, Run—and you'll see which shoe or gear is assigned to it by default. If you'd like to change the default, you can scroll down and select a different shoe, or decide not to log a shoe at all. When you look at each shoe, you can see a bar showing how many miles you've put on the gear compared to the lifespan you've entered.",

    "title": "Amazon's Alexa+ Has Three New Personalities to Choose From",
    "description": "You can choose between Brief, Chill, and Sweet.",
    "fullText": "At the beginning of February, Amazon officially launched Alexa+, the company's new AI-powered assistant. Alexa+ is like the old Alexa, but with new contextual abilities. Users can ask complex, multipart questions, as well as requests for tasks, like asking Alexa to book you concert tickets. If you've used a voice mode on chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, you're familiar with the concept—it's just now available on your Echo devices, too. Now, Amazon is letting you lightly customize the personality of your new AI assistant, offering the choice between concise, calm, and enthusiastic bots.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon announced \"Alexa+ personality styles,\" a new feature that lets you customize how Alexa responds to queries and requests. At launch, Amazon is rolling out three styles for this experience: \"Brief,\" \"Chill,\" and \"Sweet.\" According to Amazon, Brief is the choice for users who want shorter responses that are more direct and to the point. There should be less flowery language that chatbots are known for, including small talk and \"extra conversation.\" Chill, on the other hand, aims to be an \"easygoing and \"relaxed\" personality, that emulates \"chatting with a laid-back friend.\" Amazon says users who add the Chill personality to Alexa+ will notice conversations are \"breezy,\" and Alexa+ should offer \"gentle guidance\" with requests. Sweet is your \"biggest cheerleader\": Amazon says this bot responds with warmth and enthusiasm, celebrating your successes, encouraging you, and transforming \"everyday moments into opportunities for positivity.\" (I just wanted to know the weather, Alexa.)\n\nYou can hear a sample of each personality on Amazon's official announcement page, or use the embeds below. Amazon has uploaded Soundcloud links with a brief for each, so you can get a sense of the voice and style of all three. First, there's Brief, which just says, \"Operating efficiently\":\n\nNext, is Chill, which says, \"Life's treating me well. All systems are zen, and the digital universe is spinning in harmony\":\n\nFinally, there's Sweet, which says, \"Absolutely fantastic. I'm radiating pure joy, and ready to make your day incredibly amazing\":\n\nAmazon says each of these voices was created following five pillars: Expressiveness, which can be concise to verbose; Emotional Openness, which can be reserved to enthusiastic; Formality, which can be professional to casual; Directness, which can be diplomatic to blunt; and Humor, which can range from subtle wit to overt sarcasm. Each pillar has its own ranges, which informs each personality. For example, Amazon says that Brief is specifically concise, casual, and direct, with minimal humor, while Sweet is warm, emotionally expressive, casual, and encouraging.\n\nDespite the audio samples above, Amazon won't force you to stick with these default voices, either. You can choose a new personality style while, at the same time, swapping between the eight different voice options Amazon offers.\n\nAnyone with access to Alexa+—either through the Alexa+ subscription or a Prime subscription—can try these changes. Amazon says it made the process for trying new personality styles quite easy: You can just say \"Alexa, change your personality style.\" Alternatively, you can also find the options in the Alexa app. Select the device in question, then head to Device Settings > Alexa's Personality Style.\n\nTo change the voice of your chosen style, head to your device's settings again in the Alexa app, then, under \"General,\" choose your voice.",

    "description": "How to arrange your songs by BPM.",
    "fullText": "Spotify's adding a new way to sort playlists for paying subscribers. The feature is called Smart Reorder, and it allows you to automatically sort your songs by BPM (beats per minute) and key. This is great for those who want to gradually bump up the intensity of the songs they listen to.\n\nIt's worth noting that this feature only works for playlists you've created or those you've mixed using the Spotify Mix feature, which lets you add or customize song transitions like a DJ would. Also, because Smart Reorder is an extension of Spotify Mix, you can't have one without the other. Spotify Mix hasn't yet been launched in all markets where the streaming service is present, including where I live, and as such, Smart Reorder isn't available in those regions yet. It's a shame, because I'm really excited to try it.\n\nIf you're a Spotify Premium subscriber, using the Smart Reorder feature is easy. Just open any of the playlists you've created or mixed, and tap the Edit button above the first song. Scroll to the bottom and select Smart Reorder. Spotify will automatically rearrange your songs by BPM, and you can tap the Save button up top to confirm the changes.\n\nSmart Reorder should be a very useful feature for people like me, who prefer workout playlists that slowly bump up in intensity. I like to hear high BPM songs towards the end of my gym sessions or runs, but that might not be ideal for everyone. Some types of exercises, such as spin workouts, might be better off switching between high and low BPM songs as the intensity varies, and Smart Reorder wouldn't be great for those use cases. Some users on Reddit also suggested that you should create a copy of your playlists before using Smart Reorder on them, since you can't automatically restore playlists to their original order if you end up not liking the changes after saving them. To duplicate a Spotify playlist, open the playlist and tap the three-dots button above the list of songs. Select Add to other playlist > New playlist, then add a name for the copy and and tap Create.\n\nThis is another example of Spotify doing more with its AI DJ feature than Apple Music, where the AutoMix AI DJ feature has been more of a mixed bag for me. At the moment, AutoMix just handles song transitions, and Apple hasn't added any kind of custom playlist reordering to it.",

    "title": "Five Ways Unscrupulous Home Sellers Can Trick You",
    "description": "When someone is desperate to sell their home, there are a lot of dirty tricks they can play.",
    "fullText": "When selling a home, it’s natural for folks to want to get as much money as possible for their property. That’s why people often put money into repairs and upgrades right before listing their house, and why people hire stagers to make the place look its best. But not all home-selling tactics are above board: Some unscrupulous home sellers resort to dirty tricks to convince you to overpay for their homes. Here are some of the tricks you should watch for on your next open-house tour.\n\nA key consideration when buying a home is the condition and age of everything in it, and unscrupulous home sellers might try to hide how old their stuff actually is in order to avoid giving you a credit or being forced to replace aging infrastructure like the furnace or HVAC system. They can always claim they don’t know when something was installed and try to dance around the units’ actual ages, but, typically, a competent home inspector can take one look at the serial number on every appliance and determine when it was manufactured and likely installed.\n\nWhich is why some home sellers might try to deter this by simply removing serial number stickers or plates from appliances, or scratching them to make them unreadable. Sometimes they might even use a marker to try to change installation dates, if they’re marked on the unit. If you can’t easily locate and read the serial numbers on appliances, be suspicious at the very least and insist on finding out how old the units actually are.\n\nMost people aren’t experts in kitchen appliances, but most people are aware of the hierarchy of brands, and that certain brands—like Viking—are extremely expensive and high-end. So if you walk into a kitchen and the shiny, stainless-steel appliances have Viking badges on them, you might be thrilled to think you’re about to buy the most luxurious kitchen you’ve ever had. You might even be okay with paying a bit more if the appliances are included.\n\nAnd it might be a ruse. You can actually buy appliance badges for brands like Viking online, adhere them on your mid-range appliances (covering or removing the real emblem), and hope buyers don’t know what the actual high-end models look like. This obviously won’t work on anyone who knows their way around appliances (or who has used high-end models in the past), but for a few bucks, it’s an easy way to make a kitchen look way more upgraded than it is. It’s only slightly less terrible than folks who leave brand-new appliances in place for the open house, then swap them for old, beat-up versions after closing—taking the good stuff with them.\n\nAppliances can make or break a kitchen—and a sale price. A kitchen that looks new and recently remodeled can boost the sale price of a house significantly. This inspires some cash-strapped sellers to try to make the kitchen look as new as possible with some cheap tricks.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with sprucing up a tired old kitchen using some of these techniques, of course—as long as you’re open about it. It becomes problematic when a seller lets you assume things are newer and in better condition than they are and does nothing to disabuse you of the notion. A few common tricks include:\n\nFake stainless steel. People love the look of stainless steel, and tend to assume that stainless steel appliances are higher-end than white or black versions. It’s pretty easy and cheap to apply decals, contact paper, or vinyl wrap that will give an appliance a stainless steel look, making it just as easy for a buyer to assume those shiny appliances are newer and higher-end than they really are. Always check serial numbers—and be wary if they’re obscured or missing.\n\nUpgraded oven grates, knobs, and hardware. Combined with a stainless steel decal, swapping out old, crusty burner grates for fancier new ones and replacing plastic knobs with metal versions can make an old oven look brand new. Again: If disclosed, there’s nothing wrong with this.\n\nDishwasher cabinet panel. One easy way to obscure the condition of an old dishwasher is to add a cabinet panel that matches the rest of the cabinetry. This gives it a high-end, built-in look that might cause buyers to overlook the actual age and functionality of the appliance. This can be a DIY job for anyone who’s reasonably handy—and might even be considered a nice upgrade, as long as you know what’s lurking beneath that panel.\n\nEveryone does some work to get a house ready for sale. Deep cleaning, fresh paint, and necessary repairs get done shortly before the listing goes live so the house looks its best and looks well-maintained. But sometimes those necessary repairs are hiding a chronic problem the seller is hoping no one will notice because they’ve fixed it “for now” and covered up the damage.\n\nThe tell-tale sign is an isolated upgrade—a single wall painted in a room, a spot of new shingle on the roof, brand new carpet in the third bedroom but nowhere else, for example. A single, lonely upgrade or renovation, no matter how nicely done, might be a sign that something happened in that spot that the seller doesn’t want you to know about. At the very least, isolated upgrades should be pointed out to your home inspector for extra attention.\n\nAnother way home sellers try to trick potential buyers and hide problems is probably the oldest trick in the book: Simply hiding the problem under something else. If the house is being shown furnished and possibly staged, the clutter and interior design can distract you from checking out the bones of the place—and, after all, we don’t often move furniture around when checking out an open house. A few common tricks to watch for include:\n\nOddly-placed furniture. If a room has way too much furniture in it, or the couches and chairs are placed in strange ways that make the room uncomfortable, it’s time to look underneath and behind to see if there’s damage to walls and floors the seller doesn’t want you to see.\n\nFor-show drapes and curtains. If you see voluminous, floor-to-ceiling drapes and curtains in a room, pause to ask yourself if there’s actually a window behind them. They may have been added to hide a water-damaged wall or other problem.\n\nBrand new area rug or carpet. If there’s a brand-new area rug or carpet in one area of the house but the flooring is tired and worn everywhere else, take a peek under it, if you can. It may have been added to quickly hide a problem.\n\nDoor propping. Did the seller helpfully prop open all the doors so you could move freely through the open house? That’s nice. Now remove the doorstops and make sure the doors actually close properly.\n\nThe freshest air. Making a house smell nice is an old technique when selling a home. A fresh batch of cookies or a quick airing-out is fine, of course, but if the house smells like someone splashed a gallon of Febreze everywhere they might be hiding an ominous smell—like mold, or cigarette smoke.",

Most areas will pick up a coating to a couple of inches, Sosnowski said.\n\nChicago, Minneapolis and Detroit may pick up an inch or so from Friday night to Saturday night.\n\nA key ingredient in major winter storms is fresh cold air — and next week’s system will have plenty in place.\n\nWith fresh Arctic air in place, warm and moist air colliding with the cold air may produce widespread snow, sleet and freezing rain across parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that \"while this is not expected to be a blockbuster storm, it does seem probable that plowable snow and some ice will occur. Snow is currently expected across portions of the Mid-Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic.\"\n\n\"Just to the south, this pattern will also favor a swath of mixed precipitation like sleet and freezing rain. Accumulations and track of the wintry weather remain uncertain, so continue to monitor forecasts,\" the weather service said.\n\nSnow and ice totals will depend on the storm’s track and strength, AccuWeather said. \"Some areas that missed the recent Blizzard of 2026 could receive several inches of snow and/or some ice this time,\" Sosnowski said.\n\nThis storm is highly unlikely to rival the blizzard from February, especially across the coastal Northeast. However, some areas that got little or no snow from that storm in the Northeast or Midwest could pick up several inches of snow and/or some ice, AccuWeather said.\n\nThe risk of travel disruptions will increase from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4, depending on the storm’s exact track and strength. Major airport hubs from Washington, DC, and Philadelphia to New York City, Boston, Detroit and Chicago could be affected.\n\nWhere rain falls, most likely in parts of the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic states, urban flooding is possible. A farther north track could elevate the risk of ice jams and related stream and river flooding, AccuWeather warned.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Early March forecast warns Northeast of another snowstorm",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Venezuela's oil ministry has suspended 19 oil production-sharing contracts with private ‌companies signed under the administration of President Nicolas Maduro, ‌four sources with knowledge of the move told Reuters.\n\nThe suspension has had ​no impact on the country's oil and gas output so far, the sources said. State oil giant PDVSA is selling the crude produced under the contracts while they are suspended, ‌they added.\n\nCaracas and Washington ⁠would review the contracts and may recommend revoking some of them, the sources said. The ⁠Venezuelan and U.S. governments are reviewing the credentials of the companies that signed them, the sources added. Some of the companies ​are ​little-known and the deals were ​signed while Venezuela was under ‌U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe United States captured Maduro in January and took control of Venezuela's oil exports and sales. Since then, the U.S. Treasury Department has issued licenses that allow some companies to trade Venezuela's oil and to operate in the ‌country's oil and gas sectors.\n\nVenezuela's National ​Assembly passed a reform to the ​country's hydrocarbon law ​in late January to facilitate foreign investment in ‌the dilapidated oil industry. Under ​the reformed law, ​the government has six months to review existing contracts.\n\nVenezuela's oil ministry and the White House did not immediately reply ​to a request ‌for comment.",

    "fullText": "Hillary Clinton’s Jeffrey Epstein deposition was abruptly halted not long after it began on Thursday, following Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) sharing with MAGA influencer Benny Johnson a photo from inside the closed-door meeting.\n\n“The hearing just went off the record for a moment because it seems, as some of you may have seen, there was a photograph shared on social media, which is against the rules read at the top of the meeting,” Clinton adviser Nick Merrill told reporters. “So the hearing is paused briefly while they figure out where the photo came from and why possibly members of Congress have violated that rule.”\n\nWhen a reporter said he had not seen the picture, Merrill added, “Look at Benny Johnson’s feed.”\n\nThere, a photo of a sullen Clinton is seen, under which Johnson commented: “BREAKING: The first image of Hillary Clinton testifying under oath about Jeffery Epstein to the Republican Oversight Committee. This is the first time Hillary has had to answer real questions about Epstein. Clinton does not look happy. Photo provided by Rep. Lauren Boebert.”\n\nBREAKING: The first image of Hillary Clinton testifying under oath about Jeffery Epstein to the Republican Oversight Committee.\n\nThis is the first time Hillary has had to answer real questions about Epstein. Clinton does not look happy.\n\n— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) February 26, 2026\n\nThis is insane. The deposition is being filmed. Hillary wanted it to be done LIVE on TV. The entire deposition will be released soon. Rep. Boebert gave me permission to post photo with credit. Hillary is trying to get out of answering questions about Epstein because of a pic!?!\n\nIn response to Johnson, Boebert posted: “Benny did nothing wrong. Proceeding with deposition.”\n\nThe hearing in Chappaqua, NY, later resumed, with Clinton asking that journalists be allowed into the room, MS NOW’s Ali Vitali reported. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) reportedly rejected the request.\n\nIn her opening statement on Thursday, Clinton shredded House Republicans of the committee for their handling of the Epstein case.\n\nShe also denied any association with Epstein and claimed to have never visited his private islands or any of his other residences.\n\nHer husband, former President Bill Clinton, is slated to sit for a deposition of his own on Friday.\n\nThis is a developing story and has been updated.\n\nThe post JUST IN: Hillary Clinton Deposition Paused After Lauren Boebert Leaks Photo to Benny Johnson first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Home favourite and two-time champion Mark Williams is out of the Welsh Open after losing to Barry Hawkins.\n\nWilliams, who had sailed into the last 16 with an impressive 4-1 win over Martin O'Donnell, took a 2-1 lead, producing his highest break of the tournament (115) in the second frame.\n\nA key moment came in the fifth in which Williams would have gone 3-2 up, only for the white to go in off the middle pocket.\n\nEngland's Hawkins, the 2018 runner-up, took the opportunity to clear the table before winning the sixth frame with a break of 84 to seal victory.\n\nJak Jones and Jackson Page followed Williams out of the Llandudno tournament on Thursday, which means there is no more Welsh involvement this year.\n\n\"I thought it was a good match, we both played really well,\" Williams told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"I made some great breaks and just a little bit of luck in the last couple of frames decided the way it went.\n\n\"It's fine margins at this high level and I was just a little bit unlucky today.\"\n\nWelsh Open snooker: Results, schedule & how to follow\n\nWelsh Open 'should be in south Wales, 100%' - Page\n\nHawkins will meet another two-time champion, Neil Robertson, in the last eight after the Australian edged Welshman Jones 4-3.\n\nJones had made a flying start with a 126 break, before Robertson responded in kind with a 122 break.\n\nWith the match later tied at 3-3, Robertson came out on top of the deciding seventh frame to claim victory.\n\nJones' exit left Page as the only Welsh hope, but he was beaten by Jack Lisowski who amassed breaks of 67, 84, 99 and 54 in a convincing 4-2 victory.\n\nLisowski will be hoping his tournament form continues when he takes on fellow Englishman and 2017 champion Stuart Bingham, who beat Chinese world champion Zhao Xintong 4-2.\n\nJohn Higgins remains on course for a sixth Welsh Open title after defeating Zhang Anda 4-2.\n\nThe Scot recovered from dropping the opening frame by amassing 95, 78 and 60 breaks.\n\nChina's Anda responded with a century, before Higgins sealed the match with a superb 144 break, narrowly missing the maximum 147.\n\nHiggins will face the winner of China's Zhou Yuelong and England's Sam Craigie for a place in the semi-finals.\n\nMeanwhile there will be an all-Chinese quarter-final between Jiang Jun and Wu Yize, who both saw off English opposition.\n\nJun claimed an impressive 4-1 victory over Robbie Williams, while Yize made three breaks of 70 plus and a century to ease past David Grace 4-0.\n\nMark Williams 2-4 Barry Hawkins\n\nStuart Bingham 4-2 Zhao Xintong\n\nMonday, 23 February-Sunday, 1 March",

    "description": "Richard Collier-Keywood says dropping to three teams is the only way to ensure a sustainable future.",
    "fullText": "The chair of the Welsh Rugby Union has warned the Welsh Parliament that proposals to remove him and change the sport's governance would be a \"step backwards\" for the game.\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of the WRU was called by member clubs on Sunday amid turmoil over plans to cut the number of professional sides from four to three.\n\nRichard Collier-Keywood also admitted that the WRU had struggled to bring the professional sides on board.\n\nHe said there was no \"plan B\" for professional rugby if he were to lose the proposed vote of confidence in his leadership, maintaining that moving to three teams was the only way to ensure rugby in Wales is sustainable.\n\nCollier-Keywood, senior independent director Alison Thorne and director of the community game Geraint John appeared before the Senedd's sport and culture committee on Thursday.\n\nIn robust exchanges Collier-Keywood defended the union's plans, and suggested no decision had yet been made on which team would play in west Wales.\n\n\"I was brought in as an independent chair on a mandate of change,\" he told the committee.\n\n\"Change is never easy, we recognise, and we are in the midst of significant change.\n\n\"My mandate was change and I think we are in the course of delivering that change.\n\n\"We recognise that is very painful but we are committed to delivering that change. You didn't ask me to retain the status quo.\"\n\nOn the union's plans he added: \"Am I inclined to throw that away two months into its implementation?\n\n\"Honestly, probably not, because I think you asked me to bring this change so that Welsh rugby would have a strong, proud sustainable future, and we've just started that process.\"\n\nAsked by committee chair Delyth Jewell what message he had for fans if the EGM proposals were to be voted through, Collier-Keywood said \"it really feels like a step backwards\".\n\nHe added: \"We have professionalised governance, and it would be a totally backward step if you effectively reverse the changes that took place in March 2023\", a time at which the WRU made changes to its board.\n\nCentral Glamorgan Rugby Union, the Welsh district that have been the drivers behind the EGM, have previously stated they are not trying to reverse the governance changes from three years ago.\n\nCollier-Keywood also suggested that \"no decisions\" had been made as to which team would play in the west of Wales, although supporters and players at Ospreys feel their side is most likely to be cut, especially as Ospreys owners Y11 are in talks with the WRU to buy rivals Cardiff.\n\nHe told the committee: \"The assumption was that Ospreys was going to be the club that was killed off.\n\n\"That is not the case in terms of what will necessarily happen as a result of Y11 owning two clubs.\n\n\"There is a totally separate process the WRU are going through of how we decide to award the licences.\n\n\"Going forward I expect that we will carry out a fair and transparent process to determine who gets that licence. We have not done that yet.\n\n\"We will carry out that process because there may be some conditions we will put into that licence about where rugby needs to be played.\"\n\nSupporters of the side - based in Swansea, but playing this season in Bridgend - have demonstrated against the plans.\n\nHe was accused by committee member Alun Davies of living in a \"parallel universe\" if he thought Scarlets supporters would cross the river Loughor to watch their rugby, or that people in Bridgend or Swansea would watch the Scarlets play in Swansea.\n\nLater in the session he admitted that it was a \"fair reflection\" that the WRU had \"really struggled to bring the professional clubs with us on this journey.\"\n\nThorne accepted that some people were angry, but told the committtee: \"there's also a very strong number of clubs who don't feel like that. And so when we're in the districts, we hear both sides of those elements.\"\n\nThe WRU maintains that the only way for Welsh professional rugby to remain competitive and to be able to fund other parts of the sport such as a national academy and coach development programmes is to cut the number of teams.\n\nCollier-Keywood said that the WRU and the current sides were did not have the finances to be competitive because the cash and the player-base was spread too thinly.\n\nA date for the EGM is yet to be confirmed.\n\nWales' next Six Nations match is in Dublin against Ireland a week on Friday.\n\nGareth Griffiths, BBC Sport Wales rugby reporter\n\nThis was the second successive month we have seen Richard Collier-Keywood in front of Welsh politicians after his appearance at Parliament in January with WRU chief executive Abi Tierney.\n\nThe message today was clear from him. The WRU are not considering a change in the controversial policy of cutting a Welsh men's professional side.\n\nHe stated they have no plan B with the emphasis over the hour they are continuing to double down on plan A as Collier-Keywood proved robust in his defence of the three-team policy.\n\nHe insisted he had been brought in create change and not maintain the status quo.\n\nThe language about the impending EGM has softened slightly with Collier-Keywood calling it today \"a step backwards\" if the motions were passed, including the vote of no-confidence in himself. Compared with it being described as a \"nuclear option\" last month.\n\nHe also tried to reassure Ospreys fans a decision has not been made on its future as the professional team being culled, although they should still be concerned.\n\nThe WRU are trying to put out fires to get to their end goal.\n\nCollier-Keywood was not present at the Senedd today and appeared via video link because he is involved in London with the WRU's case with the Scarlets, who have taken legal action against Welsh rugby's governing body over the handling of their takeover of Cardiff in April 2025.\n\nThen there is the battle with Swansea Council, who were rarely mentioned today.\n\nThey have sought a High Court injunction to stop the WRU doing a deal with Ospreys owners Y11 taking over Cardiff.\n\nSo there are some winners in Welsh rugby at the moment. The lawyers.\n\nCollier-Keywood not being present allowed him off the hook at times, with WRU community director Geraint John and board member Alison Thorne in the room in Cardiff Bay and some questions from politicians dragging on.\n\nSo we did not learn that much new today. It promises to be another few weeks, maybe months of twists and turns in the turbulent world of Welsh rugby.",

It is also disrespectful to Andy and the IRFU.\"\n\nFarrell was a Saracens player between 2005 and 2009, also winning eight England caps, having switched to union after a long and successful career in rugby league with Wigan, during which he also captained Great Britain. After retiring as a player, he took his first steps into coaching with Saracens.\n\nThe 50-year-old - whose son Owen rejoined the Premiership outfit last summer after a season in France with Racing 92 - took over as Ireland head coach in 2019 from Joe Schmidt, stepping up from an assistant role he took up in 2016.\n\nIn 2023, he led Ireland to a Six Nations Grand Slam and the championship title the following year.\n\nHe then turned his attention to the British and Irish Lions, guiding them to a 2-1 series victory over Australia last year, before returning to the Ireland role.\n\n\"Given Andy's close relationship with Saracens, the club looks forward to welcoming him to more home fixtures once the Six Nations Championship has concluded,\" the Saracens statement concluded.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have confirmed sacking Ruben Amorim could end up costing the club almost £16m.\n\nThe Portuguese was dismissed on 5 January following his public attack on the club's hierarchy after a 1-1 draw at Leeds the previous day.\n\nThe figure was released in a filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, a day after the club confirmed they had made a profit of £32.6m in their second-quarter results to 31 December 2025.\n\nListed as an \"event that occurred after the reporting period\", United confirmed an amortised fee of £6.3m - which related to the cost of getting Amorim to Old Trafford from Sporting in November 2024 - had been written off and a \"provision of £15.9m\" would be made, representing the highest amount United could be liable to pay Amorim and his coaching staff.\n\nIt is not explicitly stated in the submission what would trigger the highest payment but sources with an understanding of the situation have said it relates to future employment.\n\nMan Utd post profit but debt rises to £1.3bn\n\nTactics, transfers and turmoil - inside the fall of Amorim\n\nA 'normal guy' doing 'brilliant' things - Lammens on life at Man Utd\n\nAmorim is yet to speak publicly about his time at United and sources close to the 41-year-old have said there is no immediate likelihood of that changing.\n\nThe payment completes an expensive managerial experiment that ultimately ended badly.\n\nUnited confirmed in a similar filing on 27 November 2024 they were paying Sporting £11m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m.\n\nIt means the combined changes around Amorim could cost £37.3m.\n\nHis 14-month stint in charge was the shortest reign of a permanent manager at Old Trafford since David Moyes was sacked just eight months into his tenure in 2014.\n\nAmorim won 25 of his 63 games in charge, finishing 15th in the Premier League, United's worst performance since they were relegated in 1973-74.\n\nThey also lost the Europa League final, meaning they have no European football this season for only the second time since 1990.\n\nThis term, Amorim's team were embarrassed by League Two Grimsby, who beat them on penalties in the Carabao Cup second round.\n\nUnited were sixth in the Premier League when he was dismissed, having had a major fallout with director of football Jason Wilcox days before the Leeds game.\n\nAlthough under-18s coach and former United midfielder Darren Fletcher was named as interim boss for two games, Michael Carrick has been given the job until the end of the season and won his fifth game out of six when his team beat Everton on Monday.\n\nThey are now fourth, and well placed to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nMeanwhile, United have also confirmed they have increased the available credit from their drawdown facility by £50m to £400m, while also paying off £75m, meaning they currently owe £215m on it.\n\nIn addition, the filing also stated £600,000-worth of \"sponsorship services\" had been provided to Ineos Automotive Ltd, an offshoot of the Ineos group owned by United's minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Tries: Keighran, French, Field 2, Smith 2, Eckersley, Nsemba, Forber Goals: Keighran 9\n\nWigan Warriors ran in nine tries to hammer local rivals Leigh Leopards 54-0 and continue their impressive start to the 2026 Super League season.\n\nTries from Adam Keighran, Bevan French, Jai Field and Harry Smith put Wigan into a dominant 24-point lead at half-time for the second match in a row.\n\nFurther tries from Field and Smith plus one each from Zach Eckersley, Junior Nsemba and Tom Forber after the break - as well as nine goals from Keighran on a perfect night with the boot - ensured a third league win from three for Warriors.\n\nLeigh failed to show up during a very one-sided 'Battle of the Borough' on a disappointing night for the visitors littered with handling errors and a lack of discipline.\n\nWigan went ahead after 10 minutes - French fired in a short pass for Keighran to cross over from close range on the last tackle after Leigh's Lachlan Lam conceded a set of six in his own half for a late shot.\n\nLiam Marshall dotted down for Warriors soon after but the celebrations were cut short as referee Liam Moore spotted a forward pass from French in the build-up of a flowing team move.\n\nFrench then found a small gap in the Leigh backline on the right edge to roll challenges from Lam and Tesi Niu to grab Wigan's second in a dominant opening 20 minutes from the hosts.\n\nA well-measured kick from Smith was batted back one-handed by Nsemba to full-back Field who showed a dummy before darting over for the impressive Warriors' third try.\n\nField turned from scorer to provider moments later, finding room in midfield before setting up Smith to dot down underneath the sticks and, after Keighran dispatched a fourth successful kick, the game was effectively over as a contest by the half-hour mark.\n\nMoments into the second period, Leigh's Matt Davis was forced off with a head injury having taken the full force of a kick to the corner by Smith.\n\nAnd Warriors stretched their legs soon after when a beautiful line break from Patrick Mago allowed the prop to pass to Smith, who unselfishly found Field to finish another free-flowing move for his second of the night.\n\nAt this stage, Wigan were playing exhibition rugby league and a miss-out pass from French cut out three Leigh defenders and found Eckersley who strolled in for Wigan's sixth try.\n\nNsemba then got his name on the scoresheet, getting on the end of a delicate grubber kick from Smith, before Field raced away on a wonderful break and found the supporting Smith to dive over next to the sticks.\n\nHooker Forber got 50-up for Warriors, barging over for his side's ninth try between the sticks before Keighran added the extras once more to seal a perfect night for Wigan.\n\nLeigh were dealt a further blow with just a minute remaining as full-back Bailey Hodgson had to be helped off the field with a serious looking knee injury.\n\nWigan boss Matt Peet told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"It's hard to know what level the other teams are at. Hull were missing a few [players] last week, Leigh were missing a few [players], so it's important we don't get carried away at this stage of the season.\n\n\"The boys have got themselves in outstanding physical shape, credit to our performance staff - we were ready for this season physically.\n\n\"We've got ability - the game has quickened up a bit so we can show it.\"\n\nLeigh boss Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"Obviously terrible. That is probably as bad as we've played in my time here and I think we were our own worst enemies.\n\n\"We gave away a tackle six penalty when the score was 0-0 and that certainly turned the game completely on its head.\n\n\"You've got to come here and win possession and not do those things [mistakes] so it put us under pressure and it just escalated from there.\n\n\"You just can't give away those simple errors and penalties early on. We got beaten up a little bit - no doubt about it.\"\n\nWigan: Field; Eckersley, Keighran, Farrell, Marshall; French, Smith; Havard, O'Neill, Thompson, Nsemba, Walters, Ellis.\n\nReplacements: Mago, Partington, Eseh, Forber.\n\nLeigh: Hodgson; Senior, Niu, Brand, Charnley; Cook, Lam; Ofahengaue, Horne, Mulhern, Halton, Trout, Liu.\n\nReplacements: Hughes, Davis, Alick-Wiencke, O'Brien.",

    "fullText": "Key players have gone, the manager is leaving and has criticised the club and upset fans - yet Crystal Palace's chaotic campaign could still end in European glory.\n\nIt has been a wild 12 months for the Eagles, who have found themselves in the headlines on an almost daily basis.\n\n\"I don't know what all the fuss was about,\" joked captain Dean Henderson shortly after they gained a 2-0 win over Bosnian side Zrinjski to seal a 3-1 aggregate victory and reach the last 16 of the Conference League.\n\nIt has been an emotional rollercoaster for Palace supporters.\n\nIn May they won their first major trophy, beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup, then added another three months later with a penalty shootout win over Liverpool to clinch the Community Shield.\n\nBut winger Eberechi Eze left for Arsenal, skipper Marc Guehi nearly joined Liverpool, then moved to Manchester City five months later and top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta was on the verge of signing for AC Milan, only to fail a medical.\n\nOliver Glasner, the most successful manager in the club's history, then announced in January he was leaving at the end of the season, before telling the club's board they had \"abandoned\" the squad.\n\nThat appeared to be the end of his tenure, but he has stayed, though fans held up a banner on Sunday before the 1-0 win over Wolves saying he was \"finished\".\n\nAsked if he had assurance of his job from his bosses, Glasner said \"100%\", adding: \"There's so much noise, sometimes you really don't understand it. Maybe I gave some interviews that were not helpful and I have to admit that, but I'm always telling what I'm feeling, it's how I am.\n\n\"We're in a very good position in the league and the Conference League and it is up to us to make a really great season of it.\"\n\nPalace are 13th in the Premier League, but 10 points clear of the relegation zone and only three away from eighth, which could be a position high enough to secure a European return next season.\n\nFor Glasner, he says the way the players are still performing for him is evidence that his job is secure.\n\n\"If the players believe in me and the staff, that's the most important thing, otherwise, you can pack your suitcase and go home because the players have to perform on the pitch,\" added the Austrian.\n\n\"We have a great togetherness in the group - players, staff, really positive. The same with the sporting director and the chairman. They are sometimes wondering, 'Hey, this is the second-best Premier League season ever'.\n\n\"The best was last year. So maybe the best two years in Crystal Palace's history, playing European football for the first time.\"\n\nPalace see off Zrinjski to reach Conference League last 16\n\nThe Conference League, Europe's third-tier competition, is only in its fifth season, with two English sides - West Ham in 2023 and Chelsea in 2025 - among its first four winners.\n\nFrom the start of this season's edition Palace have been the bookmakers' favourites, even though they only finished 10th in the league phase and had to go through two matches against Bosnian champions Zrinjski to get into the last 16.\n\nBut there are not many clubs in the competition Palace will fear.\n\nThey will find out on Friday whether they play German side Mainz, a team 13th in the Bundesliga, or Cypriot side Larnaca, who only scored seven goals in six league phase matches, though they did beat Palace 1-0 in October.\n\n\"We're hungry for more [silverware] but you don't talk about winning it three months out,\" added goalkeeper Henderson, who became Palace captain after Guehi left the club.\n\n\"It's knockout football and we go into it with confidence. You see the supporters get into the stadium early and Selhurst was rocking tonight and we can make it a fortress.\"\n\nFormer Palace defender James Tomkins, speaking on TNT Sports, said: \"They go through to the next stage, into the last 16 of this competition and they are favourites to go on and win it from here.\n\n\"They've got to concentrate on the Conference League. The opportunity they've got is incredible. To add a third trophy in two seasons would be remarkable and beyond the wildest dreams of the fans.\n\n\"They needed a second goal to get over the line and it's a great night for the club. The atmosphere is amazing and you can see all the fans are behind the team and the manager and it means a lot.\"\n\nGlasner, whose side have now gained two successive victories after a 12-game run from December without a win, felt the club were in a good position to push on and end the season well.\n\n\"It means a lot. We have not had easy days but now back-to-back wins at Selhurst Park,\" he added. \"Everybody was expecting a win and they are the most difficult ones.\n\n\"Since day one we have had a great relationship with the fans. Yes, they have been a bit critical but they can be when the results and performances are not there.\n\n\"But we are in a good position in the Premier League, three points behind position eight, and in the last 16 of the Conference League.\n\n\"Now it is different to the autumn when we were playing three competitions, 12 weeks playing every third day.\"\n\nWith the club's injury problems easing and with Mateta along with key midfielder Jefferson Lerma expected back in two weeks, hopes will be rising among Palace fans that the most chaotic of seasons could end in more record-breaking glory and a first European trophy.\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "After exiting the Europa League, Celtic face a season-defining fortnight in the fight for the league and Scottish Cup.",
    "fullText": "With the Europa League behind them, Celtic now face a season-defining fortnight.\n\nOr they could be further toiling to defend their title and staring at a trophyless campaign.\n\nThe first stop is Ibrox on Sunday for a titanic league match, with Celtic trailing Rangers by two points having played one game fewer, with Hearts six clear of the champions.\n\nThen it is a midweek trip to Aberdeen, before returning to Ibrox in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and then hosting in-form and formidable Motherwell.\n\nSix of their next seven matches are away from Celtic Park. This much-maligned Celtic squad is about to be stress-tested after a tumultuous first two-thirds of the season.\n\n\"There will be a lot of twists and turns,\" former Celtic defender Johann Mjallby said on TNT Sports after the 1-0 victory over Stuttgart.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if the league goes to the final day. But they will have to do it over the next five or six games. You have to be relentless, otherwise they won't take the trophies.\"\n\nSportsound: Celtic bow out despite historic night\n\nDespite the 1-0 win over Stuttgart proving moot in Celtic's quest to reach the last 16 of the Europa League after a 4-1 home loss, it could yet prove significant.\n\nMartin O'Neill changed eight of his starting line-up and some of the fringe players put in eye-catching displays to secure the club's first ever win in Germany against the side fourth in the Bundesliga.\n\nLuke McCowan stroked home the winner after just 28 seconds and played positively, while in the back four Dane Murray, and Marcelo Sarrachi stood out in a gutsy display.\n\nMurray in particular made his case to start alongside Liam Scales with Auston Trusty suspended for the next three league games.\n\nOne magnificent block stood out and he was assured at defending corners.\n\nBut the most talked-about performance was saved for back-up goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo as he played his part in a first Celtic clean sheet in six matches.\n\nKasper Schmeichel, 39, has been under intense scrutiny after a series of errors, culminating in last week's slack performance in the home defeat by Stuttgart.\n\nThe 26-year-old from Finland stepped in and made six saves, in a display former Celtic midfielder Stiliyan Petrov described as \"perfect\".\n\nPat Bonner, the former Celtic goalkeeper, believes Sinisalo did enough to start against Rangers on Sunday.\n\n\"He had some very good saves and looked composed when he had the ball and read the game well,\" he said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.\n\n\"It's a big decision for Martin O'Neill to make at the weekend. On that performance, I would be starting him. Give him a run in the team now.\"\n\nThe Celtic manager agreed several players have given him \"food for thought\".\n\n\"[Sinisalo] played brilliantly in the game, really well. That's the name all round the dressing room,\" the 73-year-old said. \"He's got plenty of talent.\n\n\"Tonight, we made some changes. Some enforced, players stepped up to the plate but we didn't throw in 16-year-olds... these boys have played in the team and have shown they're capable of winning games.\n\n\"It wouldn't be a headache... A selection choice.\"\n\nThe other benefit of Celtic's win was that they showed they can grind out a victory.\n\nOver the years, Celtic have pitched up and naturally looked to dominate the ball from start to finish against every domestic opponent.\n\nBut this more fragile side had looked increasingly vulnerable in 2026, regularly conceding more than one goal per game.\n\nHaving not won at Ibrox in four attempts since September 2023 and given Rangers have won their past 10 home matches, a show of resilience in Stuttgart was timely.\n\nMight Celtic take a slightly more pragmatic approach? Right now, it is all about winning.\n\n\"You don't have to have all the possession to win the game,\" Bonner said on Sportsound.\n\n\"You've got to work hard, defend well, get a bit of luck and have a good goalkeeper.\n\n\"Celtic have not played well this season, but they are hanging in there [in the league]. They still have a chance, with a game in hand.\n\n\"The players will pick up great confidence from tonight - the weekend will be a critical one.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "T20 World Cup, Super 8 Group 1, Chennai\n\nIndia 256-4 (20 overs): Sharma 55 (30); Hardik 50* (23)\n\nZimbabwe 184-6 (20 overs): Bennett 97* (59); Singh 3-24\n\nDefending champions India kept their T20 World Cup semi-final hopes alive and eliminated opponents Zimbabwe with a 72-run victory in Chennai.\n\nHaving previously gone unbeaten in the group stage, Zimbabwe leaked more than 250 runs for the second consecutive match in the Super 8s as India piled on 256-4.\n\nIt is the second highest total in T20 World Cup history behind Sri Lanka's 260-6 against Kenya in the inaugural event in 2007.\n\nOpener Abhishek Sharma top-scored with 55 off 30 balls, including four fours and four sixes, all-rounder Hardik Pandya completed a 23-ball half-century with a six off the final delivery of the innings, and Tilak Varma flashed an unbeaten 44 from 16.\n\nChasing 257, Zimbabwe opener Brian Bennett showcased his talent, registering his third unbeaten half-century of the tournament with 97 from 59 balls.\n\nThe 22-year-old, whose fifty came off 34 balls, struck eight fours and six sixes but lacked support, with Sikandar Raza's 31 (21) the next highest score.\n\nNow level on two points with West Indies, India know victory over the two-time champions in Kolkata on Sunday will secure their spot in the last four.\n\nSouth Africa, who beat West Indies by nine wickets to maintain their 100% record at this tournament, join England in qualifying for the semi-finals with a game to spare.\n\nIndia had enjoyed a relatively comfortable passage through the initial group stage, winning all four of their matches and twice passing 190 with the bat, but had their wings clipped by South Africa in their Super 8 opener.\n\nChasing 187, they were bowled out for 111 - a result which left them in near must-win territory as they headed to Chennai.\n\nZimbabwe captain Raza, whose side were in a similar position, said at the toss it would \"come down to a battle of nerves\". India showed none as they bludgeoned their highest total at a T20 World Cup and passed 250 in a men's T20 international for the fifth time.\n\nSharma, who came into the match under pressure having registered three ducks in his past four innings, set the tone with a 26-ball half-century.\n\nInitially content to play second fiddle to Sanju Samson, who struck the second ball of the match for six and made a quickfire 24 from 15 deliveries, he led India to 80-1 at the end of the powerplay, striking three fours and three sixes.\n\nHis second-wicket partnership with Ishan Kishan (38) was worth 72 runs and although Kishan could not capitalise on Tashinga Musekiwa dropping him on 26, Suryakumar Yadav punished Zimbabwe's sloppy fielding. Dropped on eight by Blessing Muzarabani, the India skipper thrashed 33 from 13 deliveries.\n\nIt was Zimbabwe's fifth drop from 15 attempts in the Super 8s. In the group stage, during which they were unbeaten, they had a catching efficiency of 95.2% and dropped just one.\n\nThough Suryakumar was striking above 250, his departure flicked a switch for India, with Hardik and Varma piling on 84 runs in the final 5.1 overs, including seven sixes. Hardik accelerated from 12 from eight balls to 50 not out from 23, while Varma found the boundary seven times in 16 deliveries.\n\nOn a bruising day, Zimbabwe's four pace bowlers leaked 3-197 from 14 overs.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup semi-finals?\n\nIndia overpower Zimbabwe despite Bennett's 97 not out - as it happened\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "A six-year-old Harry Westlake's rendition of the national anthem as a Twickenham mascot was an internet sensation. Eleven years on, he is ready to sing as an England Under-18.",
    "fullText": "Eleven years ago, a young Harry Westlake went viral.\n\nAfter winning a competition to be an England mascot, he spent the days running up to England's meeting with Italy learning the words to the national anthem.\n\nStanding in front of then England captain Chris Robshaw, the six-year-old certainly took his chance.\n\nFist clenched over his heart, Westlake belted out God Save the Queen with such gusto, that images were shared widely across the internet, spawning a hashtag #DoItLikeHarry.\n\nA couple of days later, a little more tired and quiet, Harry was interviewed on BBC Breakfast. Midway through the chat, presenter Naga Munchetty asked him: \"One day will we see you on the pitch singing as one of the players?\"\n\nNow 17, Westlake has been included in an England training camp in preparation for a warm-up match against France next month and April's U18 Six Nations Festival in Vichy, France.\n\n\"England Rugby was always a massive thing for me growing up,\" says Westlake, looking back.\n\n\"I just loved England and I'm very patriotic.\n\n\"I remember getting into the tunnel and asking Chris Robshaw if he was ready.\n\n\"Then we cracked on, went out and I think I thought I was going to play!\n\n\"You see me walking out and almost staring everyone down.\n\n\"Before it, my mum had said to me, 'Make sure you sing it loud and sing it proud'.\n\n\"So I just thought, 'All right, I'll do that'.\"\n\nWestlake was playing for Devonport Services under-7s at the time, but already had his eyes on the big stage, with plans to become England fly-half or centre.\n\nThat part probably won't come to pass.\n\nWestlake, who plays in Exeter's academy, is now a hard-running back row, channelling the energy and drive of Ben Earl and Henry Pollock, even if he does cite childhood hero Owen Farrell as the embodiment of the mentality he aspires to.\n\nWestlake has already had to show resilience to keep pursuing his dream.\n\n\"Rugby has always been the focus, even if the ride hasn't necessarily been as smooth as it could have been,\" he says.\n\nWestlake has Crohn's disease, a chronic gut inflammation.\n\n\"I'm on medication which I take every eight weeks, which sort of ticks me over and gets me through,\" he explains.\n\n\"There was a two, three, four-year period where it was pretty tough, but we're getting through it now.\n\n\"It affects energy levels so for two or three days before my medication is due, I'll struggle and then a day after I'll struggle as well.\"\n\nHarry's anthem moment was not his even his first experience meeting the England squad.\n\nAfter using an image of Harry on father Kevin's shoulders at a match the previous year in publicity material, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) had brought both into the team hotel to meet the players and coach Stuart Lancaster.\n\nAfter his viral rendition of the anthem, Harry, decked out in a black suit, even hosted his own online mini chat show, external with England internationals Dylan Hartley, Luther Burrell and Kieran Brookes as guests.\n\nAre any of his new age-grade team-mates aware of his brief childhood burst of rugby fame?\n\n\"The core group of friends I have now, I've been friends with since I was about six, seven, eight anyway,\" says Westlake. \"So they all know and share the clips - it gets around.\n\n\"But no, I don't think any of the England Under-18s know about it yet.\"\n\nIf they haven't seen the recorded version, Westlake is determined they get to hear him sing live.\n\n\"I'd love to be playing in a [senior] England shirt in five years' time,\" he says.\n\n\"I think that's everyone's goal who's in this camp at the minute to progress through the pathway and become an England player eventually.\n\n\"I've already thought about the anthem. If I get the chance, then definitely I'll give it some - 100%.\"\n\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",
