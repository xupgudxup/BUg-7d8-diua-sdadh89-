    "fullText": "Pirates' Konnor Griffin gets $100 million contract update from insider originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKonnor Griffin is already turning into a household name in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Pirates' shortstop phenom hasn't even played an MLB game.\n\nThat hasn't stopped the Pirates from pursuing a contract extension with the 19-year old who was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2024 MLB Draft.\n\nGriffin is taking Spring Training by storm. With each passing day, he increases his chances of making the Opening Day roster.\n\nAnd even if he's not there for game one, Griffin will arrive soon enough, and he'll have a chance to develop into one of the best players in the game.\n\nBecause of all the potential, which made him the No. 1 prospect in the entire sport by every major outlet, Griffin is someone the Pirates want to sign early to a contract extension.\n\nPirates reporter Jason Mackey recently suggested that if it happens, it'll be for more than $100 million.\n\nPittsburgh has never done a deal like that with a player before an at bat in the big leagues, but Griffin isn't like any player they've had in recent memory.\n\nMORE: This Mets phenom ate 900 raw eggs in a month to develop his 100 MPH fastball\n\nAny extension the Pirates sign with Griffin would have the goal of buying out at least a couple of his free agent years.\n\nWhen a player like Griffin reaches the majors, he has three years of pre-arbitration salaries, then three more years of salary negotiated via arbitration, for a total of six years of club control.\n\nSo if the Pirates can get Griffin to sign an eight or nine year contract, it takes the six years of club control to a longer amount. And for Griffin, it would ensure security while also potentially getting him a slight raise in these early years when he'd otherwise be making quite the low salary.\n\nIt's not clear whether Griffin wants to do something like that or if he'd prefer to ensure he reaches free agency at the earliest opportunity.\n\nWhat is becoming more and more clear is that Griffin could really become a superstar sooner rather than later.\n\nTeam USA has a finalized WBC roster and an awesome lineup\n\nDominican Republic WBC roster is loaded with stars\n\nAn Edwin Diaz nightmare looms for the Mets\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nHow Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nPhillies' phenom has an MLB All-Star father",

    "fullText": "The Las Vegas Raiders have been firm about keeping Maxx Crosby around for next season, but the situation between both sides still has some loose ends. Crosby has spent seven years with the franchise and built one hell of a resume during that stretch.\n\nHe has got 278 solo tackles, 161 assists, 69.5 sacks, three fumble recoveries, and one interception to his name. The edge rusher has earned five Pro Bowl selections too, which speaks to how much he has meant to the team.\n\nMORE: Maxx Crosby’s future with Raiders gets significant update amid trade buzz\n\nHowever, his future probably won’t get sorted out until he’s fully back from knee surgery last month. That hasn’t stopped the rumor mill from spinning though. Reports suggest the Raiders could still entertain trade conversations while Crosby works his way back from meniscus surgery.\n\nNFL Network’s Tom Pelissero recently shared an update on the Rich Eisen Show on Thursday by saying Crosby could get moved sooner than people think, possibly within the next week or so.\n\n“I would say it is fair to assume that the Raiders are getting many calls about Maxx Crosby,” Pelissero said.\n\n“You heard what John Spytek said in this room. He expects Maxx to be back, great relationship, texting and talking. We have not heard from Maxx Crosby since that session. Maxx has many ways on social media and podcasts to potentially respond. I would say the Raiders don’t need to make calls. They will get calls on Maxx Crosby. Is there a world where Maxx Crosby gets traded in the next 7 to 10 days? I believe there is.”\n\nThe chances Maxx Crosby is traded out of #RaiderNation between now and the start of the new league year is…\n\n… @TomPelissero runs it down for us:#NFL #NFLCombine #NFLDraft pic.twitter.com/dN0YDLY5Az\n\n— Rich Eisen Show (@RichEisenShow) February 26, 2026\n\nThe new league year officially begins March 11. Before that, teams get a brief head start. The legal tampering window opens March 9.\n\nGeneral manager John Spytek addressed the whole thing at the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. He was direct about wanting Crosby on the roster when next season rolls around.\n\nThat didn’t stop the noise from getting louder afterward. Mike Florio from NBC Sports mentioned the Raiders would at least hear teams out if they called about a potential deal.\n\nThe price tag would be steep though. Any team trying to pry Crosby loose would need to cough up two first-round picks and throw in a player just to get the conversation going.\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nOLYMPICS: Most talked-about Olympic romances from 2026 Winter Games\n\nNBA: Andrew Friedman, other Dodgers execs get new roles with Lakers after $10 billion sale\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: USA men’s hockey draws record Olympic gold medal TV viewership\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Martin Short’s daughter Katherine tragically dies at age 42\n\nVIRAL: Pat McAfee makes stunning gesture during Team USA’s $150K Gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Maxx Crosby trade update reveals when Raiders could make move appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s priority is to strengthen their midfield in the summer, but they could also be compelled to invest in the side’s backline ahead of next season.\n\nHarry Maguire is in the final months of his contract at Old Trafford, but United are yet to make a breakthrough over a contract extension.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt, meanwhile, has struggled with fitness issues and last played for United in November. Lisandro Martinez has also rarely been an ever-present figure since joining the Red Devils from Ajax in 2022.\n\nLast week, The Peoples Person relayed a report claiming Newcastle defender Malick Thiaw is Manchester United’s “top target” to reinforce their defence.\n\nSigned from AC Milan for an initial fee of £30 million, Thiaw has been a revelation at St James’ Park, impressing with his aggressive style of defending.\n\nIt was suggested that the 11th-placed Newcastle could be forced to overhaul their backline if they fail to qualify for next season’s European competitions.\n\nThe report claimed both United and Bayern Munich are keen on making a move for the 24-year-old German.\n\nHowever, according to journalist Christian Falk (via Bayern Insider), United are more likely to sign Thiaw than Bayern in the summer transfer window.\n\nIt is believed the Bundesliga leaders admire the six-foot-four Germany international. However, a potential move for him or any other central defender will depend on Kim Min-jae leaving at the end of the season.\n\nAs such, United “could prove to be better competitors” for the “unbelievable” defender.\n\nFalk said: “I heard that Manchester United, however, do have their eye on the centre-back, so perhaps this is the more interesting transfer story at the moment!”\n\nIt is underlined that a more “reliable” defensive option “will surely be sought” at United in the summer.\n\nFeatured image George Wood via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Ilia Topuria dropped a ton of information during a lengthy streaming interview with Adin Ross. One thing he couldn’t reveal: his next opponent or fight date, because he doesn’t know who or when it will be.\n\nTopuria hasn’t fought since a June 2025 knockout of Charles Oliveira and made the decision to take a break from fighting over the winter to deal with a contentious divorce and custody situation. That was resolved at the start of February, and a month later “El Matador” still doesn’t have a clear timeline for return.\n\n“In summer,” Topuria told Ross. “Hopefully. If I’m fighting in the White House, I don’t know. I don’t know. You don’t say to the UFC where they have to put you and they don’t tell you how you fight. This is basically how it works. As of right now I have no f–king idea what’s going on. I’m ready.”\n\nThe obvious opponent would be Justin Gaethje, who just beat Paddy Pimblett for an interim lightweight title at UFC 324 in January.\n\nIlia Topuria told Conor McGregor to pull up on him in Spain 😳😭\n\n\"I'm in Madrid, March 7. Come, you're more than welcome. Try to do something.\"\n\n(via @adinross) pic.twitter.com/VLCouMb40F\n\n— Championship Rounds (@ChampRDS) February 26, 2026\n\n“I thought [Paddy] was going to win the fight,” Topuria said. “The fight was f–king horrible. I think they both looked really bad. Both of them. I think [I’ll fight Justin next]. I think so.”\n\nBut any other name is fine too. Topuria made it clear that the only thing stopping a potential Arman Tsarukyan fight these days is the UFC.\n\n“If they call me, if they want me to fight with Arman, no problem,” he said. “I fought with so many tough opponents. I don’t want to fight Arman? I don’t care. If they give me that fight, I’m fighting him. All of them. Same night.”\n\nThe fight he’s most interested in at this moment, though? It’s the same fight Adin Ross suggested was what the fans really desired: a match-up against welterweight champion Islam Makhachev.\n\n“[Islam] is what I want too,” Topuria said. “The perfect scenario for me would be fighting him in the welterweight division because that way I’d be able to collect my third belt.”\n\n“But also it would be great scenario to fight between 155 and 170 and create a new belt, why not, call it ‘Pound For Pound.’ Because he’s the No. 1, I’m the No. 2. Right now for me, I’m the No. 1. But yeah, you put two of the best guys in the world for the Pound For Pound belt, in the middle. Whoever wins is the best.”\n\nWhatever the UFC decides, they’ll have to keep in mind Ilia Topuria is not like Merab Dvalishvili, who tried to defend his title four times in one year.\n\n“Everyone has his own style, if that makes him happy, he has to do that,” Topuria said of Dvalishvili, a fellow Georgian. “For me, I don’t like to fight three or four times a year because I really enjoy having a proper training camp. I never go into the Octagon with an injury or something like that. I always go at my 100%. When I go inside the Octagon, I really want to fight.”",

    "fullText": "Over the course of the last few weeks, Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has resisted the urge to act on impulse.\n\nInstead, his approach to, at least external uncertainty over head coach Oliver Glasner's future, has been measured.\n\nParish's path towards deciding, as of yet, not to bring forward the Austrian's exit from Selhurst Park may yet prove one of the defining factors in what the club hope will be another historic season climax.\n\nIn many ways, the easiest decision for Parish was to sack Glasner, who has already disclosed he is leaving the club when his contract expires at the end of the season.\n\nAhead of the club's 1-0 win at Brighton on 12 February, the team had not won in 12 in all competitions.\n\nGrowing sections of the fanbase had turned on the Austrian, who had infamously aired his displeasure at the sanctioning of captain Marc Guehi's move to Manchester City before confirming his decision to leave this summer.\n\nThe win at the Amex Stadium provided brief respite, their 3-2 home loss to relegation threatened Burnley, having taken a two goal lead, just days later wasn't well received by supporters.\n\nGlasner continued to air his angst in public, calling on supporters to stay \"humble\" in the face of calls for his head – a soundbite that landed dreadfully with fans.\n\nBut Parish held his nerve when pressure to call time on Glasner's reign at Selhurst Park was as strong as it had ever been.\n\nThe result: two consecutive wins over Wolves and Zrinjski Mostar to book their place in the Conference League last 16 and to move to within just three points of eighth in the Premier League.\n\nPlight has been replaced with optimism. Indeed, Palace have now lost just one game in six.\n\nOf course, the merits of keeping faith with Glasner will be fully judged at the end of the season.\n\nBut Parish's decision to seek stability over upheaval at such a crucial stage of Palace's season has shown early signs of paying off.\n\nAs a lifetime Palace supporter it is, perhaps, harder for Parish than other club owners to disregard emotion from decisions regarding the club.\n\nBut Parish's apparent ability to compartmentalise shouldn't be underestimated in Palace's recent upturn.\n\nThe lack of a clear candidate to replace Glasner on a short-term basis would likely have been considered in recent weeks.\n\nThe managerial landscape will change drastically in the summer.\n\nA number of managers that Palace would view as suitable candidates to replace Glasner, the likes of Andoni Iraola and Marco Silva, are set to be out of contract in the summer.\n\nThomas Frank, recently sacked by Tottenham, will be open to a new project from the summer.\n\nFrank Lampard, who is currently in the midst of a promotion tilt with Coventry, is highly regarded at Selhurst Park and could be enticed by a return to London depending on how this season ends.\n\nSean Dyche is out of work and will look to return ahead of next season.\n\nIt is logical for Palace to wait until the summer as they look to appoint Glasner's successor.\n\nYou would imagine Glasner's body of work would also have been a point of consideration for Parish in recent weeks.\n\nThe Austrian is widely recognised as the team's greatest ever manager having led Palace to last season's historic FA Cup victory – their first ever major trophy – the Community Shield triumph over Liverpool in August and the club's first ever foray in European football.\n\nThings behind the scenes are not perfect and while Glasner's public outbursts are not ideal, there is a recognition that in the 49-year-old they still have an accomplished coach that has led the club to arguably the greatest period in its history.\n\nThere is also an understanding that Glasner can be emotional and, on occasion, those emotions can spill over.\n\nWith that all said, relations between the club and Glasner are described as positive and certainly not as unfavourable as some would assume given the public comments made by the manager.\n\nMore recently, Palace have sensed a greater zeal in Glasner amid a sense that the manager is focused on bringing the curtain down on his reign with further glory.\n\nSo, for now, Palace will continue with Glasner at the helm. Unless there is a significant change in the course of events in the coming weeks, the expectation is that Glasner will see out his contract before riding off into the sunset.\n\nThere has always been a reluctance from Parish to fire Glasner for the reasons outlined above.\n\nThat reluctance certainly hasn't waned in light of the club's recent improvement. Parish won't be rushing to fire a manager he views as one of the greatest the club has ever had.\n\nIf the Austrian can add the club's first-ever European trophy then Parish's decision to stick should not be overlooked.",

    "fullText": "FC Barcelona learnt their opponents for the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 earlier today, with the draw pairing them against Newcastle United.\n\nThe Magpies qualified for the Round of 16 via knockout playoffs, where they defeated Qarabag, and will now take on the Blaugrana, having already lost to them once in the league phase.\n\nBarcelona were represented at the draw by sporting director Deco, who gave his opinion on facing Newcastle United in the Round of 16 in a little over a week.\n\n“This level is tough. People have their opinions, and they know how difficult the clubs are, but it’s a tough draw for everyone. Now we have to prepare for the next match,” the former Portugal international said.\n\nWith Barça playing the second leg of the knockout fixture at home, Deco admitted: “It is an advantage, but only if you approach the first match with seriousness. It’s a very tough pitch; we won, but we suffered.”\n\nBarcelona face Newcastle in the Round of 16. (Photo courtesy: FC Barcelona official website)\n\nWith the bracket for the entire tournament now set, Barcelona will end up facing the winners of Atletico Madrid and Tottenham in the quarter-final.\n\nOn the possibility of facing Atletico later on in the competition, after having been beaten 4-0 by them in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final, Deco remarked:\n\n“It’s definitely possible. We have the second leg of our Copa del Rey tie and a league match; that would be four games, plus the ones we’ve already played.\n\n“I don’t know when was the last time we faced each other so many times in a single season.”\n\nDeco also issued an update on the condition of Frenkie de Jong, who suffered a hamstring injury during training on Thursday.\n\n“It’s a muscle strain, it’ll be out for 3-4-5 weeks, usually no longer. He’s unlikely to return before the international break,” the Barça director noted.",

    "fullText": "Maple Leafs' Oliver Ekman-Larsson trade desires made clear originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs have not done what they needed to do out of the Olympic break.\n\nThe Leafs needed to go on a quick hot streak to avoid being sellers by the March 6 NHL trade deadline, but instead, they lost back-to-back games. That puts a lot of players into the spotlight as potential trade targets, including Oliver Ekman-Larsson.\n\nIt sounds like the veteran defenseman would much prefer to stay put, though.\n\nLeafs reporter Nick Alberga posted this on X:\n\n\"We'll see what happens, but he doesn't want to go anywhere. He loves Toronto. He wants to stay in Toronto. He wants to win in Toronto.\"\n\nMORE: This slip-and-slide lowlight sums up the Maple Leafs' season\n\nBecause of Ekman-Larsson's vast experience, he could be one of the more desirable players the Leafs have to offer to a contending team before the deadline.\n\nAnd that means that Ekman-Larsson's desire to stay put may end up flying in the face of the Leafs' hopes for retooling for next season.\n\nEkman-Larsson does have a 16-team trade list, according to Alberga, but that gives the Leafs enough room to still pull something off.\n\nMORE: Sidney Crosby breaks silence on injury, Olympics and rest of Penguins' season\n\nThis season, Ekman-Larsson has eight goals and 27 assists (35 points) in 59 games.\n\nThe 34-year old does have a Stanley Cup in his career with the Florida Panthers a couple seasons ago, so he's proven he can get it done on a big stage.\n\nTeams will certainly want OEL if he's indeed on the block, no matter what his current thoughts are about leaving Toronto. He's a trusty veteran who would surely be steady in defense for whatever team might add him.\n\nAuston Matthews, Maple Leafs now forced to face tough reality\n\nA salary cap rule may make 2 Flames trades difficult\n\nZach Werenski made 'the play before The Play'\n\nIt'll be complicated to trade for Steven Stamkos\n\nAlex Ovechkin has shared an update on his retirement plans\n\nEvgeni Malkin gets big news on a possible future",

    "fullText": "Every fantasy baseball season is shaped not just by proven stars, but by the wave of young talent steadily rising through the minor leagues. Prospect evaluation has become a core part of the modern fantasy game, blending traditional scouting with data-driven projection models to identify players who could soon shift competitive balance. The Top 10 fantasy baseball prospects represent more than just potential—they embody the next generation of category impact, roster value, and long-term upside.\n\nWhat makes this group especially compelling is the diversity of skill sets. Some project as high-average hitters with advanced bat-to-ball skills and elite on-base ability. Others bring explosive power profiles that could translate into home run production early in their major league careers. Then there are the dynamic athletes—players whose speed, defensive versatility, and run-scoring ability can reshape fantasy lineups even before their power fully develops. On the pitching side, premium velocity, refined pitch arsenals, and strikeout upside create the kind of ceiling that fantasy managers aggressively pursue.\n\nProspects also represent calculated risk. Development is rarely linear, and even elite talents must adjust to higher competition levels, mechanical refinements, and the mental demands of professional baseball. Still, these ten players have separated themselves through performance, tools, and trajectory. They’re not just names to monitor—they’re potential difference-makers who could define future fantasy championships.\n\nFor managers willing to invest early, understanding this tier of talent isn’t optional—it’s strategic leverage.\n\nPosition: SS\nGriffin brings a rare blend of athleticism and offensive upside that makes him one of the most exciting young shortstops in the minors. His power-speed combination gives him legitimate five-category fantasy potential if his hit tool continues to develop. With advanced instincts and physical tools, he projects as a future impact player in the middle of the diamond.\n\nPosition: 2B\nMcGonigle is known for his polished approach at the plate and mature feel for contact. He controls the strike zone well for his age and consistently finds ways to get on base. As his strength develops, he could grow into more power while remaining a steady fantasy contributor.\n\nPosition: SS\nWetherholt stands out for his pure hitting ability and advanced bat control. He shows excellent pitch recognition and sprays line drives to all fields with ease. If his power continues trending upward, he could become a high-average, high-run producer near the top of a lineup.\n\nPosition: SP\nYesavage features a strong fastball and a deep pitch mix that allows him to miss bats consistently. His command and mound presence suggest he could move quickly through the system. For fantasy managers, his strikeout upside makes him especially appealing if he settles into a front-line role.\n\nPosition: SP\nMcLean is a power arm with explosive stuff that can overwhelm hitters when he’s locked in. His fastball-slider combination gives him swing-and-miss potential at any level. Refining consistency and command will determine whether he becomes a high-end starter or dominant late-inning weapon.\n\nPosition: SS\nMade is an athletic infielder with quick hands and exciting upside on both sides of the ball. He shows promising bat speed and developing power that could translate into strong fantasy production. As he gains experience, his speed and defensive range should keep him in everyday lineups.\n\nPosition: SS\nEmerson is a disciplined hitter who consistently works quality at-bats. His advanced plate approach and smooth swing give him a high offensive floor. With continued physical growth, he could evolve into a reliable source of average, runs, and emerging power.\n\nPosition: OF\nJenkins has the look of a well-rounded outfielder with impact potential across multiple categories. He combines strong contact skills with developing power and solid athleticism. If everything clicks, he could become a middle-of-the-order presence who contributes in both average and extra-base production.\n\nPosition: C\nBasallo offers rare offensive upside for a catcher, especially with his raw power from the left side. He already shows the ability to drive the ball with authority and produce extra-base hits regularly. If his defense continues improving enough to stay behind the plate, his fantasy ceiling is extremely high.\n\nPosition: OF\nClark is an explosive athlete whose speed and energy stand out immediately. He profiles as a dynamic top-of-the-order threat capable of scoring runs and stealing bases in bunches. With improving strength and contact consistency, he could develop into a complete fantasy outfielder.\n\nFantasy baseball rewards foresight, and today’s elite prospects are tomorrow’s foundational stars. Tracking their progress now provides a competitive edge when opportunity meets readiness. Whether you’re building for the future or hunting immediate breakout value, this group represents the pipeline of impact talent poised to shape the next era of fantasy baseball.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top 10 fantasy baseball prospects appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The ATP Tour has decided to permit players to wear human performance bands, following a situation that emerged during the Australian Open.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, who went on to win the tournament, was among those told to remove their Whoop bands during the event.\n\nThese devices are used by athletes across different sports, providing real-time data on things like heart rate and recovery.\n\nReacting to pushback from some of the tour’s biggest names, including Alcaraz, the ATP Tour has changed its stance and will now allow players to wear performance bands in competition.\n\nAfter the Australian Open, the ATP board met and decided to update their policy, allowing certain wearable devices at events moving forward.\n\nAryna Sabalenka, Jannik Sinner, and Alcaraz were all asked to remove data performance bands during the first Grand Slam of the year.\n\nJust a month later, that will no longer be the case following a swift U-turn from the tennis governing body.\n\nThe ATP explained in a statement: “The board approved a rule that extends to the range of permitted wearable devices providers and on-court use by players in ATP competition, and authorised management to determine and finalize the implementation details, including what, if any, new data governance controls to implement.”\n\nWhoop responded at the time with a statement supporting athletes’ rights: “Athletes have a fundamental right to understand their own performance and health.”\n\n“Including during competition at events like the Australian Open. Blocking access to personal health data does not protect sport.”\n\nIt wasn’t much of an issue then; each player took their band off without much fuss. But now they won’t have to worry about it anymore.\n\nTennis has shifted towards analytics just like every other elite sport over these last 20 years or so. Players are constantly tracking everything from technique adjustments to training loads.\n\nSabalenka wasn’t impressed with the ban and didn’t hold back in her criticism during the tournament.\n\n“The reason why I was wearing that on court, because we received the email that we got approval from the ITF to wear this device,” she said during a press conference.\n\n“The whole year we are wearing – on WTA tournaments, all the tournaments I play. It’s just for tracking my health.\n\n“I don’t understand why Grand Slams have not allowed us to wear it. I really hope that they will reconsider ‌the decision and let their players track their health monitor.”\n\nThe decision to overturn the ban came quickly, a rare move for a major sporting body. But it made sense, especially given how much tennis leans on data these days.\n\nThe game now relies heavily on performance data, with both ATP and WTA Tour players using analytics to fine-tune everything from their serve technique to overall fitness levels. This was bound to create friction sooner or later.\n\nRoland Garros, set for May, won’t see any of those issues resurface.\n\nGael Monfils names toughest rival among Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer\n\nWhat Iga Swiatek said she ‘really respected’ about Steph Curry in 2025\n\nGael Monfils reveals the career he wants to switch to after retiring from tennis",

    "fullText": "MLB’s ABS Challenge System has baseball fans intrigued by how it affects games and New York Yankees star Aaron Judge got a look in spring training.\n\nThe new Automatic Ball-Strike technology has been in the works in baseball for many years. However, 2026 will finally mark its debut at the MLB level after several years of operation in the minor leagues.\n\nMeanwhile, Judge got a closer look at how the ABS Challenge System works Thursday in New York’s spring training game. Unfortunately for the MLB superstar, the result didn’t go in his team’s favor.\n\nMORE: 2026 World Baseball Classic favorites, nations with best odds to win title\n\nAaron Judge challenges the call\n\nA closer look at how the ABS Challenge System powered by T-Mobile will look when you head to the ballpark in 2026! pic.twitter.com/REZNXJOrB9\n\nMLB posted a video breaking down the sequence when Judge stepped up to the plate. In a matter of seconds, everyone in the stadium, including Judge, was able to see the pitch and where it landed in relation to the strike zone.\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred continues to find ways to innovate in professional baseball, and the ABS Challenge System could be another huge win for the sport. This comes on the heels of the pitch clock speeding up the timing of games in recent seasons.\n\nBaseball fans are seemingly enjoying the faster-paced nature of games, and the new challenge system can surely play an additional role in speeding things up.\n\nMORE: Rear end surgery sidelines MLB knuckleballer in spring training\n\nOne area of the game that MLB fans at home will need to adjust to is the on-air experience with the new ABS system. The league recently revealed that TV watchers won’t be able to see the customary strike zone that’s been shown on screen for several years.\n\nBaseball originally introduced the concept to make it clearer for fans to see balls and strikes.

    "fullText": "The 2026 league year is coming next month. It officially begins on March 11, with the legal negotiating period beginning on March 9.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have many roster decisions to make before then.\n\nLeading up to the new league year, we will profile every player on the roster, go over what they did last season, what their contract status is and what they face in 2026.\n\nNext up is tight end Tip Reiman.\n\nReiman surpassed Elijah Higgins as the Cardinals' No. 2 tight end, as he is a devastating blocker. His season was cut short in Week 5 when he fractured his ankle and missed the rest of the season on injured reserve.\n\nIn four games played, he had three receptions for 18 yards in his second NFL season.\n\nReiman, a 2024 third-round draft pick, is under contract through 2027. In 2026, he will make $1.3 million in salary and count almost $1.6 million against the salary cap.\n\nReiman hopes to be healthy for training camp. New head coach Mike LaFleur is a fan of multiple tight end sets on offense, so he will likely be part of theiir offensive plans once he is healhthy enough to play again.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "He was supposed to have put his 2025 woes behind him, but Bagnaia fell short of the mark on a tricky Friday in Buriram",
    "fullText": "Francesco Bagnaia has owned up to the mistakes that led him to miss out on direct access to Q2 for the second straight edition of the Thai Grand Prix.\n\nIn 2025, the factory Ducati rider missed the cut on Friday before topping Q1 on Saturday morning to rescue his weekend. It was a sign of things to come later in the season, however, as Bagnaia's year descended into a nightmare.\n\nMotoGP Thai GP: Marco Bezzecchi lays down ominous Friday marker\n\nNow the Italian faces a similar situation at the Buriram opener, where again much will depend on him producing the goods in Q1. The 29-year-old accepted blame for the way he handled the constant threat of rain during practice on Friday.\n\n\"It was my bad,\" he told media afterwards. \"I didn't work well. I had too much rush.\n\n\"Before the session, we just decided to change the set-up a bit. But it was in the wrong direction. And as soon as I started to see the sky becoming grey, we decided to put on new tyres to do a better lap.\n\n\"But with that set-up, I was struggling. And then I was too late.\n\n\"I need to be more calm. As the first day of the season it could have been better, but I need to remain more calm.\"\n\nAnother Friday disaster for Bagnaia ran contrary to his pre-season testing form at this track and thus the expectations of many observers. But the Turin man assured his fans that he was still fundamentally happy in normal conditions.\n\nAsked how the bike had felt in general before the pre-practice set-up change, he replied: \"Quite good. It's clear that the conditions have changed a bit compared to the test. But it's OK. And this morning I was quite happy with the bike.\n\n\"We struggled a bit with tyre consumption, and we saw that Aprilia with [Marco] Bezzecchi was really competitive. And I think that at this moment he is three or four tenths faster than the other bikes. But the feeling was quite good.\"\n\nBagnaia added that he was feeling better aboard the latest Ducati in terms of corner entry: \"It looks like you can brake later and stop the bike [earlier]. So, it's a good improvement for me.\"\n\nBagnaia continues to use the 2024 fairing on his bike, however. Team-mate Marc Marquez is doing the same, albeit because this makes the bike less physical to ride given his current injuries.\n\nIn keeping with the rules, the top two riders from Q1 on Saturday morning will proceed to the battle for pole position in Q2.\n\nWatch: MotoGP 2026: Thai GP - Iconic Moments\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Every spring, the NFL Scouting Combine becomes football’s most revealing evaluation stage, where measurable performance can elevate prospects from promising college standouts to coveted professional investments. Yet the athletes who arrive prepared to excel there rarely emerge by chance; they are shaped within programs that consistently transform elite recruitment into disciplined, pro-ready execution.\n\nOver decades of draft cycles, a select group of universities has distinguished itself by sending extraordinary numbers of players to this national proving ground. Programs like the Alabama Crimson Tide, Ohio State Buckeyes, LSU Tigers, Georgia Bulldogs, Florida Gators, USC Trojans, Oklahoma Sooners, Miami Hurricanes, Michigan Wolverines, and Notre Dame Fighting Irish have built reputations not merely for winning games, but for producing athletes equipped for professional scrutiny. Their sustained presence reflects deep recruiting networks, sophisticated strength development, and coaching philosophies aligned with modern professional schemes.\n\nPlayers trained in these environments face weekly competition that mirrors the speed, complexity, and physical demands they will encounter at football’s highest level. As a result, combine invitations become more than individual achievements; they serve as recurring evidence of institutional systems that reliably convert potential into measurable performance. Examining which programs dominate participation offers insight into where player development is most systematic, most demanding, and most closely aligned with the expectations of professional football.\n\nThese ten programs illustrate how sustained excellence emerges when infrastructure, culture, and competition operate in harmony, ensuring that year after year new prospects arrive prepared to meet professional benchmarks with confidence, discipline, and measurable distinction across every position. Here are the number of athletes invited from each college.\n\nAlabama’s player development machine has been one of the most consistent talent pipelines in modern college football. Year after year, elite recruiting classes are molded into pro-ready athletes who arrive at the combine polished and physically dominant. The program’s culture of competition ensures even backups often develop into legitimate NFL prospects.\n\nOhio State blends blue-chip recruiting with a pro-style development structure that translates cleanly to the NFL stage. Their athletes frequently test among the most explosive and technically refined at the combine. The program’s depth means multiple position groups consistently send waves of prospects each year.\n\nLSU’s reputation for producing NFL-caliber talent is rooted in its physical style of play and emphasis on individual skill development. Defensive backs, receivers, and defensive linemen in particular have become signature exports. The Tigers’ ability to develop raw athleticism into elite performance metrics shows up clearly in combine testing.\n\nGeorgia’s recent dominance has coincided with a surge in combine invitations, especially from its historically deep defense. The program emphasizes speed, strength, and scheme discipline that mirrors professional systems. Their roster depth ensures that even rotational players often project as high-ceiling prospects.\n\nFlorida’s long tradition of athletic, fast-paced football has produced a steady stream of combine invitees across multiple eras. Skill-position explosiveness and defensive versatility are recurring hallmarks of Gator prospects. Even through coaching transitions, the program’s recruiting footprint has kept NFL interest high.\n\nUSC’s legacy as a West Coast powerhouse has long translated into strong NFL representation. The program consistently attracts elite skill talent, particularly at quarterback, receiver, and defensive back. When the Trojans are nationally competitive, their combine presence typically surges alongside it.\n\nOklahoma’s offensive innovation has produced some of the most technically advanced and productive prospects in college football. Quarterbacks and offensive playmakers often arrive at the combine with extensive high-level game experience. The program’s ability to showcase talent in high-scoring systems boosts visibility for NFL evaluators.\n\nMiami’s historic identity is built on speed, swagger, and defensive playmaking — traits that translate well to combine testing. The program’s peak eras established a reputation for producing physically intimidating and explosive athletes. Even during rebuilding periods, the Hurricanes’ talent pipeline remains nationally respected.\n\nMichigan’s balanced roster construction and physical style produce prospects known for discipline and technical soundness. Linemen and defensive players in particular often arrive well-developed in strength and fundamentals. The program’s recent resurgence has reinforced its standing as a dependable NFL feeder.\n\nNotre Dame combines national recruiting reach with a reputation for developing fundamentally sound, high-character players. Offensive linemen, tight ends, and defensive front players frequently emerge as combine standouts. The program’s emphasis on preparation and consistency helps prospects transition smoothly to pro evaluation settings.\n\nUltimately, the programs that dominate combine invitations represent more than tradition or recruiting reach — they reflect sustained excellence in development. Producing one NFL prospect is impressive; producing waves of them year after year defines institutional identity. As long as these schools continue to pair elite talent with elite preparation, their presence at football’s premier evaluation stage will remain not just expected, but inevitable.\n\nOLYMPICS: Final 2026 Winter Olympics medal count, standings\n\nNFL: 4 blockbuster NFL trades we want to see before the 2026 draft\n\nNFL DRAFT: 2026 NFL Scouting Combine day-to-day TV schedule, how to watch\n\nMLB: MLB Power Rankings as 2026 Spring Training begins\n\nNBA: Updated NBA Power Rankings as a new week begins\n\nVIRAL: Watch Johnny Gaudreau’s children join Team USA hockey gold medal celebration\n\nThe post Top 10 colleges with most NFL combine invites appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have landed a dream Champions League draw and will not need to face a traditional heavyweight before the semi-finals, while the five other English sides all face potentially daunting ties from the last-16 onwards.\n\nChelsea will play Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain while Manchester City will once again face Real Madrid and Newcastle will take on Barcelona in a glamour draw as the knockout stage bracket was revealed. Liverpool drew Galatasaray while Tottenham were paired with Atletico Madrid.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal, meanwhile, now have an excellent opportunity to go on a run in this season’s competition and will play Bayer Leverkusen in the last-16 before either Sporting or Norway’s Bodo/Glimt, who will attempt to continue their fairytale run after knocking out last year’s finalists Inter.\n\nWith six English teams taking their place in the last-16 draw, there could be a record number of Premier League sides in the quarter-finals after Chelsea and Newcastle, who could have faced each other, were handed ties against PSG and Barcelona respectively.\n\nChelsea’s meeting with holders PSG will invoke memories of last summer’s Club World Cup final, as the Blues produced a stunning performance to defeat the newly crowded Champions League winners in New Jersey.\n\nThe winner of that tie will face either Liverpool or Galatasaray in the quarter-finals. Arne Slot’s side will return to Istanbul for the second time this season, following a 1-0 defeat early in the league phase, before hosting the Turkish side at Anfield in the second leg.\n\nIn the same half of the draw, Manchester City will play Real Madrid in a Champions League knockout tie for the fifth consecutive season. Pep Guardiola’s side have lost their previous two, but won 2-1 in the Bernabeu in December when they met in the league phase. The winners of that tie would face either Bayern Munich or Atalanta in the quarter-finals.\n\nOn the other half of the draw, Newcastle can look forward to a romantic trip to Barcelona for the first time since the 2002-03 season, having lost to the La Liga leaders on the opening night of this season’s league phase. Marcus Rashford scored twice as Barcelona won 2-1 at St James’ Park in September.\n\nTottenham, who are facing up to the very real threat of relegation from the Premier League, will seek salvation in the form of just a second-ever meeting with Atletico Madrid and their first since the 1963 Uefa Cup Winners’ Cup final, as Spurs became the first English side to win a European title. Should Tottenham advance, they would face either Newcastle or Barcelona.\n\nArsenal, who boasted the best record in the league phase to qualify as top seeds, were handed perhaps the most favourable draw of the six English sides. The Gunners would not need to face any of PSG, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Liverpool before the final they are to reach a first Champions League showpiece since 2006.\n\nThe last-16 first legs will be played across Tuesday 10 March and Wednesday 11 March, with the return legs held the following week. With the exception of Newcastle, who qualified for the last-16 via the play-offs, every other English team will be at home for the second leg.\n\nParis Saint-Germain / Chelsea vs Galatasaray / Liverpool\n\nReal Madrid / Manchester City vs Atalanta / Bayern Munich\n\nNewcastle / Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid / Tottenham\n\nBodo/Glimt / Sporting CP vs Bayer Leverkusen / Arsenal",

    "fullText": "Everton owner Dan Friedkin has made his position clear regarding a potential summer sale of Iliman Ndiaye to Manchester United.\n\nAfter several years spent offloading key players to stay within Premier League financial rules, Everton finally appear to be on more stable ground.\n\nNdiaye is drawing attention from Man United after another impressive campaign on Merseyside.\n\nBacked by The Friedkin Group, the Toffees are no longer under pressure to make sales and can be more selective in their transfer dealings.\n\nAnd when it comes to Ndiaye’s future at Goodison Park, Friedkin seems prepared to draw a line.\n\nFriedkin is close to finalising a new sponsorship deal at Everton, which should give David Moyes more financial flexibility in the upcoming transfer window.\n\nAs the Toffees look to strengthen their squad in the coming months, the American businessman is determined to keep Ndiaye away from Old Trafford.\n\nBen Jacobs told The United Stand: “I mean for me, Iliman Ndiaye isn’t your typical like left winger. He can play anywhere and he loves going central.\n\n“So that’s why I’m led to believe that they’re (United) not really pushing on that. And as we’ve said before, Everton’s perspective is the same as Jarrad Branthwaite. Man United bid multiple times for Jarrad Branthwaite and Dan Friedkin and his team said, ‘No, we’re not selling’.\n\n“Everton do not see themselves as a selling club. So, I think Ndiaye may look for a move, but I’m under the impression from Everton sources that he’s going to be really difficult to get out of that football club this summer and they might even offer him improved terms,” the journalist concluded.\n\nNdiaye has spoken about wanting to win trophies with Everton, a goal that now seems more achievable under the club’s new leadership.\n\nDespite the recent inconsistent results that may be frustrating supporters, Friedkin’s determination to keep the No. 10 at the club demonstrates the shifting mentality on Merseyside.\n\nA stronger show of commitment from the Friedkin family would be to reject any summer move by securing Ndiaye with improved terms.\n\nRecently, Everton News suggested that the club could aim to extend Ndiaye’s deal before the year is out.\n\nSince arriving on Merseyside, the Senegal international has hit a good run of form for Everton, becoming a key part of their attack.\n\nIt is no surprise other clubs are interested given how he has performed in an Everton shirt.\n\nNdiaye has scored 16 goals since joining, and losing him would leave a significant gap up front that would not be easy to fill.\n\nEx-Everton boss Sean Dyche emerges as leading option for Championship club\n\nJordan Pickford backed to break Premier League appearance record at Everton by Joe Cole",

    "fullText": "Team USA's Brady Tkachuk has criticized the White House for sharing an AI-generated clip that shows him insulting Canadians\n\n“It’s clearly fake because it’s not my voice and not my lips moving,” he told the Associated Press\n\nTkachuk also denied being the voice heard shouting “close the northern border” during Trump's locker room phone call to the U.S. men's hockey team\n\nTeam USA's Brady Tkachuk is speaking out about an AI-generated clip shared by the White House that shows him insulting Canadians.\n\nTkachuk, 26, and the U.S. men's hockey team won gold at the 2026 Winter Olympics with their 2-1 overtime win against Team Canada on Sunday, Feb. 22.\n\nThe White House then shared a clip on TikTok featuring fabricated audio that falsely showed Tkachuk appearing to refer to Canadians as “maple syrup-eating f--ks.”\n\n\"Silver does NOT shine just as bright 🥇🦅,\" the White House captioned the video, with a note stating, \"Contains AI-generated media.\"\n\nIt's also clear in the video that the athlete's mouth doesn't match up to the audio, something Tkachuk pointed out when speaking to the Associated Press about the clip in question.\n\n“It’s clearly fake because it’s not my voice and not my lips moving,” he told the news agency. “I’m not in control of any of those accounts. … I know that those words would never come out of my mouth.”\n\n“I would never say that. That’s not who I am,\" Tkachuk — who plays in Canada for the Ottawa Senators — added to the outlet.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond after being contacted by PEOPLE for comment.\n\nWhile speaking to the AP, Tkachuk also denied being the voice heard shouting “close the northern border” during the hockey team's locker room phone call with Donald Trump after Sunday's win.\n\n“I’ve been seeing stuff that people think it’s me, but if you watch the video, that’s not my voice and something that I never say,” Tkachuk told the outlet. “I don’t really know how that kind of took a storm on its own when I play here and give everything I have here.”\n\nDuring the locker room phone call, the U.S. men's hockey team accepted a personal invite from Trump to visit the White House to celebrate their gold medal win.\n\nThe athletes ended up being the guests of honor to attend Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday, Feb. 24.\n\nOffering a shoutout to the men's team, Trump, 79, called the athletes \"a group of winners who have made our nation proud,\" leading the politicians and guests at the U.S. Capitol to chant, \"USA.\"\n\nTrump then shared that the U.S. women's hockey team, who declined to attend the State of the Union address, would soon be visiting the White House to celebrate their own gold medal victory at the Olympic Games.\n\nPEOPLE previously reported that during Trump's locker room call with the men's team, he said with a laugh. “You do know that. I do believe I’d probably would be impeached [if the women’s team wasn’t invited].”\n\nU.S. men's team member Jack Hughes — who scored the \"golden goal\" to win the team's first Olympic gold since the 1980 Miracle on Ice — previously told the Daily Mail that the team was \"excited\" about the meeting with Trump.\n\n\"Everything is so political. We're athletes. We're so proud to represent the U.S. and we get the chance to go to the White House, meet the president. You know, we're proud to be Americans,\" he told the outlet. \"No matter what your views are, we're super excited to go.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe reporter then asked Hughes how he felt about the U.S. women's hockey team not going to the White House in the wake of their respective gold medal 2-1 win over Canada three days prior on Thursday, Feb. 19.\n\n\"They've got busy schedules, too,\" he replied, which aligned with the statement previously shared by a spokesperson for USA Hockey, who cited \"previously scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games\" as the reason why the women passed on the invite.",

    "fullText": "Lille have been drawn to face Aston Villa in the Europa League RO16 following today’s draw at UEFA’s Nyon headquarters. Les Dogues qualified for the knockout stage of Europe’s second-tier competition after a gutsy away win last night against Red Star Belgrade in the playoff round. Lille qualified in Serbia courtesy of goals from Olivier Giroud and Nathan Ngoy.\n\nLille could have drawn Ligue 1 rivals Lyon, who topped the standings in the opening phase. However, they’ll face second-placed Aston Villa, which means the return leg will be held at Villa Park. Aston Villa and Lyon previously faced Les Dogues two years ago in the UEFA Conference League quarter-finals. Should Lille were to overcome Unai Emery’s Premier League side, they would face a Serie A team in the quarter-finals, either Bologna or AS Roma.\n\nMeanhwile, Lyon have been drawn to face Liga side RC Celta Viga. Les Gones have been given a relatively kind draw given they have been placed in a quite open silver path. Should they beat RC Celta over two legs, Paulo Fonseca’s Les Gones would face Genk or Feriburg in the quarter-finals.",

    "fullText": "Pete Hegseth has threatened to cancel $200m contract unless it is given unfettered access to Claude model\n\nAnthropic said Thursday it “cannot in good conscience” comply with a demand from the Pentagon to remove safety precautions from its artificial intelligence model and grant the US military unfettered access to its AI capabilities.\n\nThe Department of Defense had threatened to cancel a $200m contract and deem Anthropic a “supply chain risk”, a designation with serious financial implications, if the company did not comply with the request by Friday.\n\nChief executive Dario Amodei said in a statement that the threats from the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, would not change the company’s position, and that he hoped Hegseth would “reconsider”.\n\n“Our strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our warfighters – with our two requested safeguards in place,” he said. “We remain ready to continue our work to support the national security of the United States.”\n\nAt the core of the Department of Defense and Anthropic’s standoff is a disagreement over how the AI company will permit its product, Claude, to be used. The Pentagon has demanded that Anthropic turn off safety guardrails and allow any lawful use of Claude, while Anthropic has pushed back against allowing Claude to be used for mass domestic surveillance or in autonomous weapons systems that can kill people without human input.\n\nAfter months of dispute and pressure from the government, Hegseth reportedly gave Amodei until Friday evening to agree to the Pentagon’s demands or face punitive action.\n\nWhether Anthropic would concede was seen as a high-profile test of its claim to be the most safety-conscious of the major AI firms, as well as whether any part of the AI industry would push back against government desires to use the technology for controversial, potentially lethal purposes.\n\nIn his statement, Amodei said using AI for autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance is “simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do”.\n\nThe Department of Defense has handed a number of lucrative deals to tech firms in recent years for the companies to build or integrate AI technology into US military systems. In July of last year, Anthropic was one of several big tech companies including Google and OpenAI to receive up to $200m contracts with the DoD. What set Anthropic apart, and has intensified its conflict with the Pentagon, is that until this week it was the only AI model that had been approved for use in the military’s classified systems. (Elon Musk’s xAI reached an agreement earlier this week to also be used in classified systems.)\n\nAnthropic’s technology has reportedly already been used for military applications, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last month, highlighting the growing use of AI in conflict. The growth of autonomous weapons technology, such as drones that can carry out operations even after their connection to a human operator has been severed, has also intensified longstanding concerns around how AI will be used in life-and-death situations.\n\nAnthropic and Amodei have long been some of the industry’s most prominent advocates for regulation and safety precautions in developing AI, even as they have struck deals with the military and this week watered down a core policy to not release new AI models without first guaranteeing their safety. Amodei’s calls for regulation, and history of political opposition to Donald Trump, have run up against Hegseth’s vows to remove “wokeness” from the armed forces and pursue aggressive military policies.\n\nIf Hegseth follows through with his threat to categorize Anthropic as a supply chain risk, it would be a huge blow to the AI company. The designation, which is more commonly intended to be used for foreign adversaries, would prohibit other vendors that do business with the US military from using Anthropic’s products.",

Fast-food giant Burger King is now taking that voice one step further, saying it will detect whether employees are using words like “please” and “thank you” through the assistance of artificial intelligence.\n\nOn Thursday, Burger King announced it is rolling out a new AI chatbot connected to employee headsets at hundreds of locations in the US as part of a platform called BK Assistant, powered by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.\n\n“Patty”, what Burger King is calling its voice-enabled chatbot, will detect whether employees are using specific words when interacting with customers, including “welcome”, “please” and “thank you”. The move is intended to “help managers understand overall service patterns”, according to a statement by Burger King.\n\nThe announcement has caused backlash online, with social media users calling the move “gross” and “peak late-stage corporate behavior”.\n\n“BK Assistant is a coaching and operational support tool built to help our restaurant teams manage complexity and stay focused on delivering a great guest experience,” the spokesperson added. “It’s not about scoring individuals or enforcing scripts. It’s about reinforcing great hospitality and giving managers helpful, real-time insights so they can recognize their teams more effectively.”\n\nOther functions of the overall platform supported by artificial intelligence include alerting managers to automatically remove items from digital menus and the Burger King app when a product becomes unavailable. It will also help employees with preparing menu items, such as telling them which ingredients go into a Whopper once an order has been placed. According to a promotional video, “Patty” can also let workers know whether the bathroom at their location needs to be cleaned.\n\nThe platform will also listen in on employee interactions with customers ordering at the drive-thru “to promote order accuracy and provide coaching insights”.\n\nThe BK Assistant platform will be available to all US locations by the end of 2026. The voice-enabled headset is currently being piloted in 500 restaurants.\n\nThe rollout comes more than a year after McDonald’s ended its artificial intelligence endeavors at drive-thrus, removing their automated AI voice responding to customer orders from more than 100 locations.",

    "fullText": "With original dialogue in Turkish, this shuffling of potential partners in a sequence of meaningless encounters ranks with the finest auteur movies\n\nI spent Valentine’s Day not with my wife but with 18 Turkish women. No, wait, I can explain. It’s a new game called Speed Dates – Winter Edition, which I only chanced upon when I searched “Winter Games” on Xbox Live hoping for some Olympics fare. And boy, did I find it!\n\nThe game is in Turkish, with English subtitles. It already feels arthouse; like those films Channel 4 used to show with a red triangle in the corner of the screen.\n\nYou are a bloke named Murat wandering around downtown when you bump into a lady friend who recommends you join her for a speed dating night. You agree and the game starts. This is the kind of fast-paced zero-exposition white-knuckle opening that we haven’t seen since Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\n\nYou are presented with a list of women. You click on them. You speed date. In glorious full-motion video! I fondly remember the wide arrival of FMV in the 90s. Mad Dog McCree, The 7th Guest, Command and Conquer, Phantasmagoria, Wing Commander 3: FMV was the first sign that video games could take on Hollywood. I thought the genre had been washed away by a tsunami of uncanny valley high-end graphics, but the auteur behind Speed Dating pays fulsome tribute with what I can only assume is deliberate buffering and stuttering of the cinematic scenes, like Scorsese deliberately making Raging Bull in black and white.\n\nMy first date doesn’t go well. Aylin has two kids and asks if I would consider adopting them. I say I would love to, although that is a lie. I don’t even want to adopt my own kids let alone someone else’s. Is this how speed dating works? Do people leap in there with the big stuff? I guess you have to.\n\nThe camera work is weird. Your dates look just off camera, in accordance with classic movie dialogue convention. But your guy? He looks directly into the camera at YOU. This makes no sense until I realise this is obviously a homage to French New Wave cinema.\n\nI fail to connect with Ayla because I refuse to say her kids look cute, and move on to Leyla who is a very different Kettle of Plenty of Fish, wearing one of those tops with a giant circle cut out of the centre region. I want to tell her she will catch her death of cold, but instead I have to tell her if I prefer to be dominant or dominated?\n\nI don’t really want either, but the game demands I pick one. I am too old to start stuffing ball gags into my gob, so I say I want to be dominant. She is happy with this because she wants a strong man. She then asks what my favourite food is. I have three options. Stuffed green pepper. Turkish ravioli. Or raw meatballs. Of course I go for the raw meatballs. I’m not stupid.\n\nShe switches back to sex again and asks what my fantasy is. For some reason, the game doesn’t let me choose an option. Instead, my guy says he would want to be invisible so he can hear what people say about him. Talk about unexpected dialogue twists. Did David Mamet write this? I match with Leyla. Get in there!\n\nEda breaks my heart. She asks me what I would do in the event of a zombie invasion. Wow! I literally think of this question every day of my waking life, priding myself on the fact that in all of the 26 houses I have lived in I have made zombie-related defensive and escape plans within the first week. But she tells me she would want to become one of the zombies. Plot twist! We do not match.\n\nI start playing this as a game, where the point is to match with everybody. It’s quite enjoyable clawing your way back from a bad start by becoming a pandering simp to a date’s every whim. I tell animal rights activist Ezgi that I have an idea about using city garbage trucks to dispense food to animals. I tell YouTuber Ayse that I follow many YouTubers. I tell bespectacled accountant Pinar that I jolly well do have a financial retirement plan. All lies. All matches.\n\nThe game is lazily stereotypical at times. All the women love shopping. They all ask me about my favourite food. Sadly, the raw meatballs never come up as an option again. But the dialogue constantly surprises me. I get asked by Esra if I inherited any traits from my family. The only response options I have are CLUTTER and PANIC. I never know where this game will go.\n\nEighteen speed dates later I have matched with eight women, which isn’t bad considering I have been out of the scene for three decades. And then … nothing. What I thought would be an end scene where I picked the lucky lady of my choosing instead sees Murat simply thank his friend for inviting him, and wandering off into the night.\n\nSome may find this anticlimactic. I prefer to think of it as the top spinning at the end of Inception, because I am still wondering what the hell I experienced here. What I can say is that it was the best five quid I have spent in years. Speed Dating – Winter Edition is surprising and engaging, as all great art should be – even if most of the time it is completely and utterly unintentionally so.",

    "description": "OpenAI and Google employees are pushing back against Pentagon pressure for broader military access to AI models.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI and Google employees are warning their companies not to hand over AI to the Pentagon without safeguards.\n\nA growing number of current and former staff at OpenAI and Google have signed a joint petition opposing the use of their companies' AI tools for mass surveillance use and weapons that can kill without human oversight.\n\nThe online petition, titled \"We Will Not Be Divided,\" invites current and former employees from both companies to oppose what they see as dangerous directions for AI deployment. Signers must be verified and may choose to remain anonymous.\n\nMore than 220 employees from Google and OpenAI have signed the petition as of Friday — 176 from Google and 47 from OpenAI.\n\nGoogle has about 187,000 employees globally as of mid-2025, while OpenAI's head count runs into the thousands.\n\nThe petition said that the Department of War is threatening to invoke the Defense Production Act to force Anthropic to provide its AI model to the military and \"tailor its model to the military's needs,\" potentially labeling the company a \"supply chain risk\" if it refuses.\n\n\"The Pentagon is negotiating with Google and OpenAI to try to get them to agree to what Anthropic has refused,\" the petition added.\n\nThe petition comes after Axios reported on Tuesday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had set a deadline for Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei to provide the US military sweeping access to the company's AI model, warning of potential consequences if it declined.\n\n\"The only reason we're still talking to these people is we need them and we need them now,\" a Defense official told Axios. \"The problem for these guys is they are that good.\"\n\nDuring a January visit to Elon Musk's SpaceX, Hegseth described AI development as a \"wartime arms race\" and urged faster deployment of cutting-edge models for military use.\n\n\"We will not employ AI models that won't allow you to fight wars,\" Hegseth said.\n\nAnthropic said in a blog post on Thursday that it would not allow its technology to be used to surveil Americans at scale or power weapons that act without human oversight.\n\n\"They're trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,\" the petition said, referring to the Department of War.\n\n\"That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand. This letter serves to create shared understanding and solidarity in the face of this pressure from the Department of War,\" it added.\n\n\"We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War's current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight.\"\n\nExperts told Business Insider in a report on Thursday that threatening to use emergency national security powers to pressure a private AI company marks a new and largely untested approach.\n\n\"We're absolutely in uncharted territory,\" Dean Ball, an ex-senior policy advisor for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and fellow for the Foundation for American Innovation, told Business Insider.\n\n\"What are the stakes for Anthropic? I mean, Anthropic could be quasi-nationalized, or they could be driven out of business,\" Ball said. \"The stakes are huge for them.\"\n\nBall said the episode could send a broader signal across the tech industry that \"doing business with the government is extremely dangerous.\"",

He is now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, where he consults on AI for national security.\n\nShanahan said Anthropic isn't \"trying to play cute here\" — and that it's \"committed to helping the government.\" \n\nIn his words:\n\nLuckey, who founded and runs the weapons and defense software startup Anduril, pointed to a previous White House decision to compel private companies to work with the US government.\n\nPosting on X several hours before Amodei's statement, he referenced a 1948 statement by then-President Harry S. Truman that ordered railway companies to allow the US military to run their operations amid a workers' strike.\n\n\"The President can't make private companies work with the military, it would be unprecedented!\"\n\nMay 10, 1948\n\nI HAVE today by Executive order taken over the country's railroads and directed the Secretary of the Army to operate them in the name of the United States Government.\n\nLater that evening, Luckey said that Silicon Valley executives should not influence military policy.\n\n\"This idea, that military policy must be in the hands of elected leaders vs corporate executive, is a foundational principle for Anduril,\" he wrote.\n\nSince Luckey founded Anduril in 2017, the company has clinched a rapidly growing list of Defense Department contracts, providing drone, counter-drone, and AI software systems to the military.\n\nAnduril is also in the running to build the US Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft, which are drone wingmen for crewed fighter jets.\n\nFormer Trump administration AI advisor Dean Ball did not mince words in an interview with Politico.\n\n\"You're telling everyone else who supplies to the DOD you cannot use Anthropic's models, while also saying that the DOD must use Anthropic's models,\" Ball told Politico.\n\nBall, who helped write Trump's AI Action Plan, added that it was \"a whole different level of insane\" for the Pentagon to \"do both of those things\" — designate Anthropic a security risk, while making the case for how essential Anthropic is for military AI.\n\nMcFaul, a political science professor at Stanford University and director of its Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, praised Amodei's statement as \"strong, principled, and very reasonable.\"\n\n\"Bravo,\" wrote McFaul, who was also the US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014.\n\n\"Many firms folded for a lot less money than what Anthropic stands to lose here,\" wrote Wright in a social media post on Thursday evening.\n\nWright was the senior director for strategic planning at the US National Security Council for the Biden administration.\n\nAs a top-ranking member of the council, he was a key architect of the 2022 US National Security Strategy, which was the framework for the administration's defense priorities and threat assessments.",

    "description": "As a kid, Faye Bradley brushed off her Chinese mom's health advice. Now, she starts each day with a warm cup of water and refuses to go to bed with wet hair.",
    "fullText": "When I first saw \"Chinamaxxing\" on my feed, I was surprised by how happy it made me.\n\nThe viral trend — where people share Chinese lifestyle hacks, from wearing red for luck during Lunar New Year to banning outdoor shoes indoors — felt like watching the world embrace the culture I grew up with.\n\nAround the same time, another phrase was everywhere: \"You met me at a very Chinese time in my life.\" The line went viral after Hong Kong-born stand-up comedian Jimmy O Yang posted a video of himself singing the well-known Chinese song \"Yi Jian Mei\" on Instagram in November, with those words splashed across the screen. The clip has since drawn more than 6.5 million views.\n\nIt was around the same time that New Jersey TikTok creator Sherry Zhu started sharing wellness tips with her \"Chinese baddies.\"\n\nGrowing up in Hong Kong, I followed these habits long before they had a name. My mom talked constantly about balance: hot versus cold foods, drying your hair before bed, and the little miracles of White Flower Oil.\n\nWatching the internet embrace these traditions made me reflect. Some explanations oversimplify centuries-old practices — feng shui isn't just moving your desk, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) isn't just a trendy tea. But the curiosity feels genuine.\n\nHere are four simple things my mom taught me years ago that I still swear by.\n\nGrowing up, my mom would reach for a tiny bottle of White Flower Oil, a concentrated ointment, whenever my brother or I complained about tummy aches.\n\nA dab of the concentrated herbal ointment — that has a sharp smell that combines menthol, eucalyptus, and a hint of lavender — on my belly, temples, or behind my ears, and relief would follow almost instantly.\n\nToday, I carry a small bottle whenever I travel and keep one at my bedside.\n\nIt's also a staple for motion sickness, muscle aches, or even mild stomach pain.\n\nMy mom had firm rules about drinks. Hong Kong summers are stifling — often 90 degrees Fahrenheit and humid — yet anything cold in the morning was discouraged.\n\nIn TCM, hot water is believed to support digestion and circulation, while cold drinks can \"shock\" the body and disrupt internal balance.\n\nSwitching to hot water first thing in the morning may sound trivial, but it transformed my mornings. My energy feels steadier, my stomach calmer, and I start the day feeling grounded instead of jolted awake.\n\nI used to brush off her advice, but after seeing my friends do the same, I began incorporating it into my routine in my late teens.\n\nTo think she was right all along.\n\n\"You'll get sick!\" my mom would yell every time I tried to crawl into bed with damp hair.\n\nI used to roll my eyes, but now, decades later, I have to admit she was right. Sleeping with wet hair often leaves me stiff, chilled, and inexplicably irritable — not just uncomfortable, but subtly disruptive to my body's rhythm and sleep quality.\n\nFor me, blow-drying signals closure: a pause at the end of the day and a small act of respect for my body. By keeping warm and dry before bed, I wake up more rested, my muscles looser, and my mind calmer.\n\nI remember heading off to university in the UK and asking my future British flatmates in a group chat whether anyone was bringing a rice cooker. \"What's that?\" they replied. \"We just boil rice in a pan.\" I was stunned. When I moved in, I quickly realized I couldn't live without one. It makes the rice taste better.\n\nAnd my rice cooker isn't just for rice. My mom taught me it's perfect for complete meals: chicken, vegetables, and rice all in one pot. The magic isn't just convenience — steaming keeps food tender, flavorful, and healthy, locking in nutrients while reducing oil. It's practical, too, with fewer pots to scrub.\n\nIt's heartening to see these traditions embraced more widely. For me, they've always been simple acts of care; practical, grounding habits shaped by generations before us.",

    "description": "A former Block data analyst who survived three layoffs says he suspected AI cuts were coming before losing his job.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ivan Ureña-Valdes, who has worked at Block for nearly four years as a data analyst. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I got an email from Jack Dorsey, I was in the middle of interviewing someone for a role at Block.\n\nIt was pretty strange because, in the past, with layoffs, I knew people had their access cut almost immediately.\n\nA coworker messaged me: \"Hey, are you okay?\" My heart started racing. I knew from that message it meant that I was probably getting laid off.\n\nI felt really bad because I was in the middle of interviewing someone. I had to tell them, \"I was actually just let go from the company. I probably won't be able to submit your feedback in time. Please reach out to your recruiter.\"\n\nI'm the sole provider for my family. It was tough.\n\nWe knew there were many performance cuts happening around right now, and those have largely finished. I had no idea this cut was coming.\n\nFor 4,000-plus people to be cut without anybody knowing, that tells me decisions were made very high up.\n\nI've survived three rounds of layoffs, some companywide, some engineering organization-wide. I knew I wasn't being let go for performance-related reasons. I was in the middle of working on two large projects, probably the largest projects I'd worked on since joining the company.\n\nI had a hunch that, at some point, the company would cut people because of AI. I just didn't think it would be right now.\n\nI appreciate Jack for his honesty. It's much fairer of him to come straight out and say why it happened — that it's because of AI and the vision he sees.\n\nI'm honestly grateful for the generous severance and benefits. It definitely helps make the rough situation a bit easier.\n\nI've felt the rumblings of AI disruption for a while now, especially since Anthropic launched Opus 4.5 late last year.\n\nJack loves AI and was constantly pushing us to use it. I got to use these tools as much as possible every single day.\n\nI could see in my own work very quickly how much of it was already being automated. So much of the data analyst world is finding the right dataset, writing something that will allow you to pull the data set that you want, and then generating output. Every single one of those steps is significantly faster and easier because of AI.\n\nIt was definitely a \"whoa\" moment when I realized just how powerful things had gotten.\n\nI 100% think that more disruption and more of these types of cuts will probably come at other companies, which is unfortunate.\n\nI'm much more pessimistic about all of it than many other people probably are.\n\nGiven that we live in the US, where growth is everything, it's inevitable that AI will continue to replace people wherever it's financially beneficial to do so.\n\nI'm optimistic that I can find a job in the general data field, whether it's something I'm extremely passionate about or pays as much as I did before. It will be difficult to find something that matches the environment I was working in because I had developed really strong ties with my coworkers. The pay was fair within the data analytics or business intelligence world, and the role was remote.\n\nThere are incredible companies out there doing great work, though I am nervous about the industry as a whole and the competitiveness as I search for that perfect next role. Some people are getting really, really high salaries at AI companies, while tons of people at Block are getting laid off.\n\nDo you have a story to share about tech layoffs?

    "description": "The Ukrainian navy released the footage on Thursday, saying the helicopter crew had destroyed eight Shahed and Gerbera drones in a single day.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine just gave us an extended look at one of its emerging tactics against Russia's Shaheds: using helicopters to shoot the drones from above.\n\nThe Ukrainian navy published a two-minute montage of such operations on Thursday, saying that a helicopter crew had destroyed eight Shahed exploding drones and Gerbera decoy drones in a single day.\n\nCockpit and gun camera footage showed the Ukrainians engaging at least five delta-wing drones in flight, with another clip showing unidentified wreckage smoking on the ground.\n\nSome clips indicate that at least one aerial engagement happened in the early morning or at night. Thermal footage from a gun camera showed the operator firing at a delta-wing drone, tracking its flight above open terrain before a screen flash indicates the drone was destroyed.\n\nOther standard optical footage, filmed from a gun camera or the cockpit, appears to show several drones being destroyed high above the clouds or over water near a coastal settlement.\n\nAdditionally, an M134 minigun can be seen mounted from a helicopter's side door, though the videos didn't show the weapon itself in action.\n\nDuring today’s massive Russian attack, a Ukrainian naval aviation helicopter crew destroyed 8 Shahed/Gerbera drones.\n\n📹: @UA_NAVY pic.twitter.com/CO2IFtNkCg\n\nThe clips indicate some of the ideal conditions for downing a Shahed.\n\nFor one, the helicopter has to match the drone's speed and trajectory and gain enough altitude to allow the minigun to fire downward at the Shahed. The chopper crew also needs to come within visual range of the drone to engage.\n\nThe footage comes several months after Ukraine said it would officially begin incorporating helicopter crews into its air defense network against Russia's one-way attack drones, which Moscow uses in mass waves to pressure Ukrainian cities.\n\nBecause Russia mass-produces the Shahed and Gerbera, Kyiv has sought more inexpensive means, such as machine guns, instead of traditional antiaircraft missiles to counter them.\n\nUkraine's commander in chief, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in October that helicopters could sometimes destroy up to 40% of Russian Shaheds and Gerberas in one area.\n\nThermal and infrared cameras, such as the one seen in the latest footage, were among the systems that Syrskyi said would be equipped on such helicopters to improve their effectiveness.\n\nUkraine also uses ground crews with interceptor drones or truck-mounted machine guns to destroy Shaheds, but a helicopter crew can reposition much faster to engage multiple threats or hunt down a Russian drone that changes its flight trajectory.\n\nThe latter scenario became increasingly common as Russia was found to be outfitting Shaheds with more advanced communications and guidance systems, and, in rare cases, artificial intelligence.\n\nHelicopters also allow for engagements at higher altitudes. Russia often directs its Shaheds to approach their targets at above 6,500 feet before swooping down to attack, making it more difficult for ground-based crews to hit the drones.\n\nAside from helicopters, Ukrainian troops have also been seen using M134 miniguns on turboprop planes to shoot down Shaheds.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia has since been reported to be attempting to counter the Ukrainian helicopters by equipping its Shaheds with R-60 air-to-air missiles.\n\nIn November, Ukraine's deputy minister of defense for innovation told Business Insider's Jake Epstein that Moscow was also directly targeting patrolling helicopters and aircraft with Shaheds.",

    "description": "OpenAI and Tesla alum Andrej Karpathy wrote that there was no more \"business as usual\" in software, thanks to AI.",
    "fullText": "The AI coding timeline is accelerating, according to the guy who coined \"vibe coding.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy has a long list of AI bona fides. He was a founding member of OpenAI, left to lead AI at Tesla, then returned to the ChatGPT-maker and eventually started his own lab. In early 2025, he introduced the term vibe coding into the zeitgeist.\n\nIn his latest X post, Karpathy described a speed-up in agentic coding, one that has taken place in just a few months. \"Coding agents basically didn't work before December and basically work since,\" he wrote.\n\nThese agents are \"extremely disruptive to the default programming workflow,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nHe gave an example. Over the weekend, Karpathy said he used AI to make a video analysis dashboard for his home cameras. His AI agent completed it in 30 minutes, encountering errors and researching solutions. It was all hands-free, he wrote.\n\n\"Programming is becoming unrecognizable,\" Karpathy wrote. \"This is nowhere near 'business as usual' time in software.\"\n\nPosts like these are now Karpathy's specialty: long, multi-paragraph takes on the state of software engineering. In one recent post, the creator of Claude Code commented that Karpathy always had a \"very thoughtful and well reasoned take.\"\n\nIn the comments on this post, an AI developer asked about the state of software engineers. \"Are teams of hundreds of people going to be replaced by a few chosen prompters?\" they asked.\n\n\"Vibe coders are now able to get somewhere, but at the top tiers, deep technical expertise may be even more of a multiplier than before because of the added leverage,\" Karpathy responded.\n\nSome big names in AI aren't so thrilled with Karpathy's linguistic invention. OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger called vibe coding \"a slur,\" arguing that it implied coding with AI was easy and didn't still involve real work.\n\nIn another comment, Karpathy referenced an old Tesla slogan: \"Every action is error.\" The goal is to arrange your agents so you can \"remove yourself as the bottleneck,\" he wrote.\n\nFor many, coding with AI can feel fantastical. Karpathy offered a quick reality check: the agents require \"high-level direction\" and (the frequently memed) \"taste.\"\n\n\"It's not magic, it's delegation,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "Google executive Keith Ballinger has worked in software engineering for most of his life, and he thinks this is the best era to be a developer.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Keith Ballinger, Google's vice president and general manager for Developer & Experiences who is based in Seattle. His identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a software engineer most of my life.\n\nI joined Microsoft in the late '90s, working on C# and .NET in those first few years, and then did a bunch of startups that were focused on developers. Later on, I came back to Microsoft through a startup that they acquired, Xamarin. My boss and I ran the deal that acquired GitHub, and then I was the senior vice president of engineering at GitHub.\n\nI came to Google about three and a half years ago. I'm the vice president and general manager for Developer & Experiences so I focus on AI assistance for developers across the software development life cycle.\n\nIf you thought your job as a software engineer was about writing code in a specific language and framework, the world is definitely changing in front of you. I've always loved to code, but that's not really what a software engineer's job is. It's to apply engineering techniques and use technology to solve problems. It's about taking something messy and making it crisp.\n\nThat's a skill that people can pick up, but now it's more important than ever, and certainly more important than memorizing how an API works.\n\nI love the era we're in right now. I'm building faster and better than ever because I can now offload complex workflows to AI, making this the most productive and exciting period in my engineering history. As a developer it really feels like the only limits right now are my imagination and time.\n\nIf you're a software engineer, there's never been a greater time to be alive.\n\nI do normal things in my job, like various meetings, reviews, and paperwork. But I try to peel off time to ideate with Gemini. Sometimes that ends up being during evenings or weekends, and sometimes it's during working hours.\n\nI'll talk to Gemini Enterprise about an idea I've had or a problem I've seen, and it becomes a sounding board. Developers talk about the \"rubber duck technique,\" where you talk to a rubber duck about your problem, and then get to the solution without having to ask anyone. When I talk to AI, it's not necessarily about having a problem, but it's about needing a place to write down my thoughts and get a reaction.\n\nThat generally leads to an idea, and I'll write a document about it that may include a spec for how it works or details around its architecture. Then I go to Gemini CLI, which is the terminal where developers work and interact with their tooling. I'll give Gemini CLI and the newly created Conductor extension what I've written, and also have it interrogate me, so that it gets an idea of what I'm trying to build.\n\nThe Gemini CLI Conductor extension helps me break down the problem, and then I let it go off on its own, and it does the tasks in order or in parallel. It lets me know once it's done writing the piece of software or component of the UI, and then I'll review the code or just the output itself, and play with it. If I don't have blocking feedback, I let it keep going and it moves on to the next task. I steer it as we go along, and then at some point I have something done, and I'll start using it.\n\nAs I use it, I'll come up with changes and I'll go back to the Gemini CLI to make those. Throughout this process, I'm partnering with AI to act as a product manager, but I'm also working as an engineer on the most important thing engineers can do: Technical architecture and how to break the problems down.\n\nAs an executive, the role I take with writing code is a bit different than what an individual contributor does. AI helps me dive into ideas for the future by prototyping very quickly. If those ideas make sense, helps me advise the team on solving similar problems in the future.\n\nMy team builds agentic developer tools like Gemini CLI, and I'm a firm believer that leaders need to use the software that their teams create. I send an email every Friday to my team that includes what I've worked on. That's how I keep myself accountable — making sure I'm always talking about these things.\n\nI don't have children or a lot of obligations outside of work — and I love coding. So I spend a significant amount of time outside normal hours experimenting with tools. It's usually around 20+ hours a week.\n\nIt's not because I have to. It's because I love it so much.\n\nIt's better to embrace AI than to ignore it. As you get more senior, your ability to write is one of the most important skills, and you have to spend a lot of time doing it to get better. The better you are, the more you can leverage AI to increase your productivity and make what you've written come to life.",

    "description": "Reed Duchscher helps creators make money on the internet. Here's what he's seeing in 2026.",
    "fullText": "You have heard of MrBeast. You have likely not heard of Reed Duchscher, who helped YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson become MrBeast, the king of YouTube, by managing him for six years.\n\nDonaldson and Duchscher split up in 2024, but Duchscher works with lots of other high-profile internet personalities, including live-streamers Kai Cenat and Hasan Piker, via his Night management firm. Now Duchscher has raised $70 million to expand Night and acquire other companies.\n\nDuchscher says it is getting harder and harder to hatch giant internet personalities — in part because platforms like YouTube and TikTok would prefer to have lots of creators who reach lots of people rather than contend with a smaller group of creators who reach everyone.\n\nI talked to Duchscher about how the creator economy is evolving and the tensions between creators and platforms on my Channels podcast. The following are edited excerpts from our conversation.\n\nPeter Kafka: You've said we may not get another MrBeast — a single content creator that dominates a platform. Why?\n\nReed Duchscher: There's a few things I've seen shift over the last couple of years. One is that the platforms don't want people to break through: The algorithms on TikTok and YouTube and Instagram now put you in this little lane of content that they know you care about, and they keep feeding you that content.\n\nPre-COVID, we would go on TikTok, and a lot of people would see Addison Rae videos, Charli D'Amelio videos. It was getting fed to the whole ecosystem. Now if you go on TikTok, you see your very small lane of content that interests you.\n\nSo that's one challenge. The platforms would rather have a middle tier of creators, with 5 to 10 million followers — they would rather have that be enormous — than have a few people break through.\n\nYou think this is intentional on the part of platforms? I understand them wanting to tune the algorithm so it gives me exactly what I want. That's different than saying \"We don't want another MrBeast,\" who has enormous power, which is what you're suggesting.\n\nYou want the algorithms to be as good as possible at keeping high session time. If you feed people exactly what they want, the session time goes up.\n\nBut we've seen \"adpocalypses\" happen — we've seen PewDiePie affect the advertising rate of all of YouTube by saying something and then people pull out YouTube ads.\n\nThat is an existential threat [to the platforms]. And when you have individuals that have a lot of power and leverage over platforms, those things can happen.\n\nWhich platforms are you telling your talent to work on if they want to reach people? And which one are you telling them to go make money on?\n\nIt was much different a year and a half ago. Now everyone has short-form content, which really acts as the tip of the spear in distribution.\n\nShort-form content is easy to get a high amount of impressions on. It gets fed to a lot of people, and things can go viral: It doesn't matter if you have two followers or 200,000 followers, a video that is good and has high retention can go viral on TikTok.\n\nWe would always tell people: Use TikTok as a discoverability mechanism. But now we have Reels and YouTube Shorts. Every platform has copied short-form, so discoverability is really good across every social platform.\n\nBut where you make money is substantially different. YouTube is still the gold standard for monetizing a creator's career.\n\nBecause they're still the only big platform that routinely shares revenue with creators.\n\nYeah. And with long-form videos, you can run multiple ad units: You can place ads every minute, every two minutes, every three minutes.\n\nI don't want to glaze them too hard, but YouTube has been at the forefront of allowing creators to make money for the last decade. They have been very creator-first in how they've handled the platform and the products they launch.\n\nInstagram, TikTok, Snapchat have not figured that out. And none of them have really figured out long-form video.\n\nYouTube in particular is really pushing people to make longer stuff, in part because people are consuming tons of YouTube on TV sets. But they're also pushing creators to make short-form stuff for Shorts, their TikTok clone. How do you do both?\n\nI tell creators that YouTube Shorts is good for getting your content seen by a wide variety of people. When you make long-form videos, you have to have a high click-through rate and a high retention for that video to get seen.\n\nBut it's harder to break through with a long-form video. It's much easier to break through the noise with a short-form video, but they just don't monetize remotely as well as the long-form videos.\n\nHow do you balance that? It seems like they're really different products.\n\n[Make] two native videos. You post a long-form, and maybe if you are Theo Vaughn or another podcaster, there may be clips that you can post out from that long-form video. But the majority of creators have to have two different strategies: You make a long-form video, and then you have all your creative ideas that make native short-form videos.\n\nIt's a hard career. It's not for everyone.\n\nI've heard people say creators should spend less time on short-form because it's harder to make money doing that. And that they should focus on live-streaming, like Hasan Piker and Kai Cenat, who are making content for six, seven, eight hours at a pop. But very few people can actually do that successfully.\n\nIt's very hard to be on live eight hours a day. But for a Kai or a Hasan, [the upside is that] the internet creates clips for them. When you go on TikTok and YouTube Shorts, you'll see a lot of Kai or Hasan content that is just organically clipped by the ecosystem of the internet.\n\nFans, or people who want to make money, or both, say, \"I'm going to take this free content that Hasan Piker's made. I'm going to edit it myself and turn that into a clip that could at least generate more attention for Hasan Piker, and maybe money for me.\"\n\nAnd we don't take those down. We usually let them be up. We are better off allowing the internet to make amazing videos of clipped content that Kai and Hasan are making on Twitch than us doing it.\n\nAnd it's worked. A lot of people see Kai for the first time through a clip that we didn't make.\n\nIt's the internet doing free labor and promotion.\n\nWell, they do make money. You can monetize short-form clips. It's just that the relative [ad rates] for those videos is way lower than on a long-form video.\n\nBut these clippers are making a decent amount of money.\n\nAre there any platforms that people are overlooking today that you think are interesting for an aspiring creator?\n\nTwitch is so underutilized and monetized. I understand the difficulty of livestreaming and being on. And I still feel like Twitch needs to continue to expand into other offerings outside of gaming and IRL. But there's a lot of ground to be gained on Twitch. It's not as noisy as all the other platforms are.\n\nI interviewed Twitch CEO Dan Clancy last year, and one of my takeaways was that maybe livestreaming is always going to be for a relatively niche audience. During the pandemic, we saw Facebook and YouTube go after Twitch, and try to build their own livestream operations. They basically walked away from it, which maybe is an indicator that this stuff just doesn't have that huge of an audience.\n\nYou're probably right. The audience is 14-to-25 year olds and it hasn't grown. But if you just go back in time, 10 years ago, YouTube was predominantly kids. And they've done a good job of widening out. My parents now can go on YouTube and find content that they enjoy.\n\nLive is a little more challenging. I just think that Twitch needs to figure out how they widen out.\n\nIn 2026, I don't think AI fundamentally changes any way that we watch or make content. I don't think AI movies are coming anytime soon. I don't think AI animation is coming anytime soon.\n\nI know this is a big worry of [Hollywood]. I am just still such a bear and I'm not optimistic about anything going on in AI as it relates to content media.\n\nThree years, five years from now?\n\nAdoption takes way longer than people think. Over the next two to three years, it's a very low likelihood that this is going to affect what we do.\n\nI think animation will be the first, and hopefully the animation studios figure out how to utilize the platforms that allow them to make things cheaper.\n\nBut I see a lot of this doom and gloom about AI in media, and I just don't feel that at all. I think we're still so far away.",

Business leaders are predicting that things will only get worse as AI disrupts the workforce.\n\nWhen Amazon announced layoffs earlier this year, the tech career coach Kyle Elliott shared what he thinks employees should do immediately after being laid off to put them in the best position to find a new role.\n\nHe also shared three common mistakes to avoid after a layoff.\n\nAfter the sting of a layoff, Elliott has seen workers turn to LinkedIn to share negative posts about their former employer.\n\n\"Sometimes people just really react from that emotion or wound, instead of waiting until it heals,\" he said.\n\nSuch posts could be detrimental when applying for a new job, when recruiters and hiring managers check your LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"People want to work with other positive people, so if they see that you're venting, they may worry, 'if we have to conduct layoffs in the future, are you going to then put a hit piece out on us as soon as you get laid off?\" Elliott said.\n\nInstead, consider waiting until you are more able to position the event differently in your post, which could be a month or two after, Elliot said. In the post, share lessons you learned and the amazing work you did at your previous company, he added.\n\nFormer colleagues can be a good resource when you're looking for jobs in the future. In your last conversation with your former colleagues before leaving the company, reiterate the work you're proud of and share what kind of opportunity you're looking for next, Elliott said.\n\nWith this in mind, it may be better to vent about your layoff experience to a trusted confidant like a spouse, best friend, or therapist rather than a former colleague, he added.\n\nVenting to a colleague could damage their perception of you and jeopardize the connection.\n\n\"A lot of people will remember that last piece, and you don't want them to be like, 'oh, they're bitter.'\" he said.\n\nElliott has noticed that clients are sometimes afraid to network because of the stigma associated with layoffs, and their fear that they can't add value to conversations while unemployed.\n\n\"Layoffs are normal now,\" Elliott said, so there's no need to avoid reaching out to people out of fear.\n\nHe recommended starting small. For example, meet a former colleague whom you were close to.\n\nIn your first conversation, focus on putting yourself out there and taking small steps toward your next role, and don't expect to be offered a job, he said.\n\n\"If you were fired and you're calling it a layoff, it's a little different. But if you were truly just laid off as part of a reorganization or cost-cutting measures, people understand that, and there shouldn't be shame in that,\" he said.",

    "title": "Jack Dorsey's mea culpa on Block layoffs: 'We overhired'",
    "description": "The Block CEO says a structural misstep and pandemic-era overhiring prompted him to slash nearly half the company's staff on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Jack Dorsey is taking responsibility for a key mistake behind Block's sweeping job cuts.\n\n\"Yes we over-hired during COVID,\" the Block cofounder and CEO wrote Friday on X, responding to criticism that the company's recent layoffs reflected managerial incompetence.\n\nThe admission comes a day after Dorsey announced he was slashing nearly half of Block's workforce — reducing head count from more than 10,000 employees to just under 6,000 in one of the most dramatic single-round layoffs in recent tech history.\n\nIn his latest X post, Dorsey said the overhiring stemmed in part from a structural misstep. He had built \"2 separate company structures (square & cash app) rather than 1,\" he wrote, a setup the company corrected in mid-2024, he said.\n\nyes we over-hired during covid because i incorrectly built 2 separate company structures (square & cash app) rather than 1, which we corrected mid 2024. but this misses all the complexity we took on through lending, banking, and BNPL. and that we’re now targeting $2M+ gross… https://t.co/uaKgTdzGob\n\nThat duplication inflated head count as Block expanded aggressively during the pandemic.\n\nBut Dorsey said critics were oversimplifying the situation. Over the past several years, Block also took on significant operational complexity, expanding into lending, banking, and buy-now, pay-later products, he said.\n\nBlock is now targeting more than $2 million in gross profit per employee — roughly four times its pre-COVID efficiency, which Dorsey said remained flat at about $500,000 per person from 2019 through 2024.\n\n\"We have and do run an efficient company… better than most,\" he wrote.\n\nDorsey later reposted an X post in which a user said there was \"very little evidence\" that Block was \"bloated.\"\n\nVery little evidence that $XYZ was 'bloated' based on the metrics below https://t.co/agIxz5DpKP\n\nAt Thursday's close, Block's share price was roughly $54, virtually flat compared to its price in 2018, seven years ago.\n\nThe layoff announcement looks set to push the stock higher, with premarket trading suggesting a surge to $64 at Friday's open.\n\nThe stock spiked from less than $75 pre-COVID to over $275 in early 2021, before dropping sharply at the end of that year. Since early 2022, the stock has traded at below $100 per share.\n\nIn the original memo announcing the cuts, Dorsey said he chose to make one large reduction rather than conduct repeated rounds of layoffs, which he called \"destructive to morale.\"\n\nHe said that the business itself is strong, with gross profit growing and profitability improving.\n\nInstead, he pointed to what he described as a fundamental shift in how companies operate to justify the layoffs.\n\nIntelligence tools and smaller, flatter teams are enabling \"a new way of working,\" he wrote, one that changes what it means to build and run a company.\n\nSeveral other tech companies — including Amazon, eBay, Meta, and Workday — have also announced cuts in recent months, often citing AI-driven efficiency gains and organizational streamlining.\n\nLast September, Micha Kaufman, the CEO and founder of Fiverr, announced a 30% workforce cut, citing the need to help turn Fiverr into a leaner, faster \"AI-first company.\"\n\n\"If you don't ensure that you sharpen your knives, you're going to be left behind. It's that simple,\" Kaufman told Business Insider last May.",

    "title": "The US Army wants to track ammo and supplies at war like you'd track an Amazon package",
    "description": "New software is designed to operate in contested environments and predict what soldiers will need before they've asked for it.",
    "fullText": "In war, keeping soldiers fighting-ready on the front lines is a difficult challenge. It's even harder when supply lines are messy and murky.\n\nIn a major conflict against a technologically capable adversary, US Army soldiers could find themselves without critical supplies, ammunition, and medical care if enemy jamming, cyberattacks, or long-range fires disrupt the flow of logistics.\n\nThat risk is shaping how the Army is modernizing the way it sustains forces under its new Next Generation Command and Control system, or NGC2, an effort to connect data, sensors, and units across the battlefield so commanders can make faster decisions.\n\nThe development of NGC2 is driving software advances, including Rune Technologies' TyrOS, a system that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to help logisticians anticipate and prioritize what units will need before shortages occur.\n\nWars have long shown the importance of stable logistics and supply lines. When those break down, resulting in ammunition shortages or food scarcity, assaults stall, defenses crumble, and battles are lost.\n\nThe Army has integrated TyrOS and other applications into NGC2 through a series of exercises in which industry partners and soldiers are working closely on iterative tweaks to the system.\n\nWith each exercise, more weapons, data, and sensors are being connected, and the scenarios that NGC2 is being tested against — like whether it'll work through jamming and electronic warfare — grow in scale and complexity with each new test.\n\nLogistics has been a key part of this. Rune joined NGC2 testing with the Army's 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii last December, and earlier this year, the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colorado, put their software to the test.\n\nHistorically, the critical elements of logistics, from inventory levels to spare parts, have been siloed, hindering communication and the speed at which soldiers can get what they need.\n\nA core aspiration with NGC2 is \"taking all of those pillars and threading them together so that we can actually enable logisticians and commanders in the military to make fully informed decisions,\" David Tuttle, the CEO of Rune, told Business Insider.\n\nThe goal is to achieve the same kind of clarity that civilians see every day.\n\n\"In the commercial space, you know where your Amazon packages are at any step of the way,\" Maj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, the commander of the 4th ID, told reporters earlier this month. \"We need that same fidelity,\" he added, so that soldiers can focus on fighting and commanders and logisticians can better anticipate what supplies will be needed.\n\nTyrOS combines large volumes of data from sensors and deployed units to effectively track what soldiers will require, who is transporting supplies to those soldiers, how they're moving them, and inventory statuses in the aftermath.\n\nThe technology is designed to work in contested environments by managing how data gets transmitted when communications aren't working and identifying short windows of connectivity when exchanging the most important information is going to be possible. It also uses AI and real-time data analytics to generate predictions about future needs.\n\nThe system could analyze a weapon's firing rate to predict when a unit will need more ammunition — instead of waiting until the ammo cans run dry. With sensors on vehicles, it could also flag when a Stryker is about to run low on fuel or needs maintenance, prompting logisticians to act before it becomes a problem.\n\nWhen building TyrOS for NGC2, Rune approached the problem sets by addressing \"what we felt military logisticians were lacking today, which was an integrated system to support their warfighting function,\" Tuttle said.\n\nAn important consideration in the development of new warfighting technologies is that logisticians, as well as commanders, need a system that can operate in an environment with denied communications and connectivity.\n\nThat starts with making NGC2 more resilient to issues like jamming. But what happens if soldiers can't connect to the cloud and can't relay to logisticians what they need?\n\nOne fix is giving commanders and logisticians the same shared view of what's happening. From there, software can quickly analyze the data and flag what units are likely to need next faster than the Army's older command and control systems. By anticipating demand instead of waiting for units to ask for help, the Army hopes to avoid supply gaps.\n\nAnd if connectivity is strained, data that's deemed more important to specific troops, operations, or sustainment is prioritized.\n\nIf a team is only going to have connectivity for a short time period or in a specific place, they need to be able to focus on what's most important. NGC2 also has several ways of establishing the necessary connectivity, whether through localized links between units or longer-range communications that can reach far beyond the immediate battlefield.\n\nTuttle said Rune is also thinking about TyrOS as a \"single-player mode\" system.\n\n\"If I'm a logistician using TyrOS, I want TyrOS to be usable, stand-alone as a single player from a predictive standpoint and in a planning standpoint, even if I don't have connectivity,\" he said. Then, when it reconnects, it synchronizes quickly within the network.\n\nWith the Army's NGC2 platform still in development, the Army continues to navigate how best to update the system by implementing feedback from soldiers and other users. Companies like Anduril and Rune have had engineers on the ground during testing phases to do quick turnarounds on refreshes, which Army officials have said represents a different relationship between the defense industry and the service.",

    "description": "Fears of a software apocalypse could spread throughout the US private credit market, increasing contagion risk, according to one CIO.",
    "fullText": "Pain in the software sector runs a serious risk of rippling the entire private credit market, according to one CIO who manages more than $20 billion in assets.\n\nVictor Khosla, the founder of Strategic Value Partners, flagged the risk of financial contagion in the US's private credit sector, an area that has worried more investors recently after Blue Owl said it was permanently halting withdrawals from one of its funds. The move drew some comparisons to how lenders froze funds leading up to the last financial crisis.\n\nBut recent pressure on the software sector, which is heavily financed via private markets, has shone a harsher light on some of its vulnerabilities, Khosla said in an interview with Bloomberg this week.\n\nIn particular, he pointed to a recent report from UBS, which estimated that private credit defaults could rise as high as 15% if AI disruption in markets ends up being more \"rapid and aggressive\" than expected.\n\nSoftware accounts for around 40% of all private equity-backed loans outstanding, according to a recent Bloomberg analysis.\n\n\"I do think, though, software is a big stick. You know, the credit market has had all these sticks being dropped on it, and one day, it'll really buckle,\" Khosla said, later pointing to a similar scenario in the mid-2010s, when energy prices crashed and sent yields on riskier private debt soaring.\n\n\"So the contagion risk in credit — yeah, worry about it,\" he added.\n\nSoftware volatility is coming at a time when the private credit space already appears to be under pressure.\n\nYields on private credit are higher, a sign that investors may be pricing in higher risks. The effective yield of the ICE Bank of America US High Yield Index currently hovers around 6.5%, up around 200 basis points over the last five years.\n\nDefaults in the space have also inched higher. The private credit default rate rose to 5.8% as of the end of January, according to an estimate from Fitch Ratings.\n\n\"Underneath the surface, it is really wobbly,\" Khosla said, later speculating that credit spreads could widen over a three- to six-month period. \"This is a fat tail risk now,\" he later added.",

    "description": "\"For Love & Money\" answers your relationship and money questions. This week, a reader feels resentful at his wife's lack of financial contribution.",
    "fullText": "Until recently, I was an executive at a tech company, earning a great income. My wife is an artist; she's always pursuing one career or another, trying to maintain a sense of financial independence, but she's never made much money doing it.\n\nThen, I got laid off. Now we're down to just our savings and her income. I'm trying my best to find a new job, but until then, we're relying on her. And while I'm spending every waking minute trying to find work, it seems like she's content making next to nothing while she continues pursuing a career we both know she'll never have.\n\nI am frustrated and resentful. How come she gets to chase this impractical dream when, even now, between jobs, I am the one responsible for keeping the ship afloat?\n\nI wonder if it's a gender thing. I'm a man; therefore, I must provide, and she is a woman, so she doesn't? I feel alone with this burden when I'd really like a partner to help me carry it.\n\nI appreciate your question, and understand that you recently lost your job — something that can be difficult for people not only in terms of financial security but also their sense of achievement and self — and feel unsupported by your wife.\n\nBased on what you've said, though, it sounds like you're discussing this issue with the wrong person; you need to talk to your wife — not only because she's your partner and the only other person with an equal stake in your finances, but also because, as I read your letter, it became increasingly clear that you're assuming a few things, like your wife's motives, the role of gender dynamics, and that her focus is entirely on her personal objectives.\n\nThe first assumption you're making is about why your wife is acting the way she is. In your letter, you wrote that she is \"trying to maintain a sense of financial independence\" and also that she is \"content making next to nothing.\" Which is it? Is she participating in the soul-crushing grind of trying to get her career as an artist to the point of actually paying off? Or is she casually indulging in her hobby while you write the checks?\n\nUntil you ask her and really listen to her answer, feeling resentful or frustrated is unfair, because those feelings are a construct of your assumptions. Instead, ask your wife where she sees her career in the next five years, what support she needs to get there, and how she wants to adjust it to fit your current circumstances.\n\nThis leads me to the next assumption you're bringing into this dynamic, which is particularly evident in your question: \"Is this a gender thing?\" My answer to that would be, it very well could be — not necessarily because your wife expects a man to provide for her, but because you're projecting that notion onto her.\n\nYour letter seems to suggest you view her contribution to your family's financial survival as voluntary, while you have no choice. In your words, \"Even now, between jobs, I am the one responsible for keeping the ship afloat.\" However, your wife is also an adult with a credit score, who must eat to survive. While I am sure she's appreciated the freedom your income has given her to pursue her dreams, your job loss has impacted her financial security as much as it has yours. And your feeling that it all needs to fall on you because you're the man in the relationship may reflect more about your gendered preoccupations than her expectations of you — and you'll never know if you don't have a conversation with her.\n\nOn the topic of gender, something I noticed was missing from your letter was a recognition of how else your wife spends her time and energy, outside chasing her \"impractical dream.\" Keeping the house clean, making meals, providing childcare if you have kids — these are all forms of labor that cost money if you outsource, and if you don't, it's money in your pocket. Statistically, women do the majority of both mental and physical work involved in these jobs. If your wife is doing this work, it's unfair to frame the way she spends her time and energy as \"impractical\" and self-focused, and it's important to acknowledge her contributions as valuable.\n\nSpeaking of self-focused, this seems to be your third assumption. She could have any number of reasons for remaining focused on her dream job, even as the wheels are spinning off the cart. Maybe she's spent so long chasing this dream that it's all she feels qualified to do. Maybe she understands your financial situation differently than you, and she doesn't think either of you needs to get a new job urgently. Or maybe this is her attempt to frantically try to find new income streams, but she doesn't feel comfortable telling you she's doing so, because she recognizes your contempt toward her career goals — as you said, \"a career we both know she'll never have.\" Trying anything is a vulnerable act because to try is to face potential failure. If your wife no longer feels safe failing in front of you, she won't try things in front of you — not even things like searching for a job.\n\nThere's a chance that these assumptions of yours aren't 100% wrong, but until you have a good-faith conversation with your wife and hear her perspective, you're operating off a false premise that isn't fair to the woman you love. Put aside your assumptions and be curious about her thought process, open-minded about what she has to say, and vulnerable about your feelings.\n\nOn the topic of gender roles, as a man, you may feel uncomfortable admitting to needing help providing. This is where you have to trust your wife to be the partner you need her to be. Show her the numbers that are worrying you, and collaborate with her on a solution.\n\nI encourage you not to approach the conversation with an adversarial attitude. This doesn't have to be a fight, because it's unlikely that you disagree. Your wife is an adult who understands financial realities — likely more than you think she does. Don't go into your conversation believing you must convince her that having little to no income is a problem. Instead, see your conversation as the meeting of a crisis committee — two people on the same team facing the same threat, who will win or lose together.\n\nBecause the thing is, Lonely Provider, you aren't alone. You just need to reach out your hand and bring your wife on the journey with you, instead of assuming she doesn't want to come along.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was originally published in October 2023.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

    "fullText": "Nvidia investors may be overlooking a small but rapidly growing part of the AI chipmaker's business, according to one investment chief.\n\nAfter Nvidia's earnings beat failed to push the stock higher, Nancy Tengler — the CEO and CIO at Laffer Tengler Investments — highlighted sovereign AI as an area of Nvidia's revenue that investors may be missing.\n\n\"The big takeaway from Nvidia earnings is that no one's really talking about the growth in sovereign, which is just getting started,\" Tengler said after the chipmaker released results for the fourth quarter.\n\nSovereign AI describes a nation or organization's ability to develop, deploy, and govern AI. Nvidia says that sovereign AI enables \"domestic AI development aligned with national priorities,\" like creating economic opportunities, driving productivity, and making countries' AI tech more competitive globally.\n\nIn the AI race era, forming AI ecosystems domestically have become a key policy priority for governments across the globe.\n\nA McKinsey survey of executives, investors, and government officials found that 71% consider sovereign AI as an \"existential concern\" or \"strategic imperative.\"\n\n\"The next phase of the AI era may well hinge on how effectively countries, companies, and investors translate that intent into action,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nNvidia's sovereign AI made up $30 billion of the the chipmaker's $215.9 billion in total sales for fiscal 2026.\n\nDuring the earnings call, CFO Colette Kress told investors that customers in Canada, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the UK fueled the company's sovereign AI growth. Nvidia recently announced a $1 billion sovereign AI project with India.\n\nWhile the segment makes up a small portion of Nvidia's total revenue (roughly 1% of all sales in fiscal 2026), sovereign AI revenue more than tripled year-over-year.\n\nTengler compared Nvidia's sovereign AI business to Tesla's rapidly growing Megapack battery business.\n\n\"I think we will continue to see these companies expand their reach, and more compute is going to be more demand,\" she added.\n\nNvidia's CFO remarks on the earnings call supported that the chipmaker is expecting to gain from ongoing sovereign AI.\n\n\"Over the long run, we expect our sovereign opportunity to grow at least in line with the AI infrastructure market, as countries spend on AI proportional to their GDP,\" she said.",

    "description": "In an 1874 paper, Georg Cantor proved that there are different sizes of infinity and changed math forever. A trove of newly unearthed letters shows that it was also an act of plagiarism.",
    "fullText": "When Demian Goos followed Karin Richter into her office on March 12 of last year, the first thing he noticed was the bust. It sat atop a tall pedestal in the corner of the room, depicting a bald, elderly gentleman with a stoic countenance. Goos saw no trace of the anxious, lonely man who had obsessed him for over a year.\n\nInstead, this was Georg Cantor as history saw him. An intellectual giant: steadfast, strong-willed, determined to bring about a mathematical revolution over the clamorous objections of his peers.\n\nIt was here, at the University of Halle in Germany, that Cantor launched his revolution 150 years ago. Here, in 1874, he published one of the most important papers in math’s 4,000-year history. That paper crystallized a concept that had long been viewed as a mathematical malignancy to be shunned at all costs: infinity. It forced mathematicians to question some of their longest-held assumptions, rocking mathematics to its very foundations. And it gave rise to a new field of study that would eventually bring about a rewriting of the entire subject.\n\nNow Goos, a 35-year-old mathematician and journalist, had come to Halle — a five-hour train ride from his home in Mainz — to look at some letters from Cantor’s estate. He’d seen a scan of one and was pretty sure he knew what the others would say. But he wanted to see them in person.\n\nRichter — who, like Cantor, had spent her entire career here, first as a research mathematician and then, after retiring, as a lecturer on the history of mathematics — gestured for Goos to sit. She lifted a thin blue binder from the scattered piles of books and papers on her desk. Inside were dozens of plastic sheet protectors, each one containing an old, handwritten letter.\n\nGoos began flipping through, contemplating the letters with the relish of an archaeologist entering a long-lost tomb. Then he reached a particular page and froze. He struggled to catch his breath.\n\nIt wasn’t the handwriting. At this point in his research on Cantor, he’d become accustomed to the strange, nearly indecipherable Gothic script known as kurrentschrift, which Germans used until around 1900.\n\nIt wasn’t the signature. He knew that the German mathematician Richard Dedekind had been a key player in Cantor’s quest to understand infinity and solidify math’s foundations, and that the two had exchanged many letters.\n\nIt was the date: November 30, 1873.\n\nHe’d never seen this letter before. No one had. It was believed to be lost, destroyed in the tumult of World War II or perhaps by Cantor himself.\n\nThis was the letter that had the power to rewrite Cantor’s legacy. The letter that proved once and for all that Cantor’s famous 1874 paper, the one that would go on to reshape all of mathematics, had been an act of plagiarism.\n\nCantor was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1845. When he was 11 years old, his father got sick, and the family moved to Germany to escape the dangerous Russian winters. Cantor would live there his entire life and eventually lose any trace of an accent. But he never felt totally comfortable in his adoptive home.\n\nAs Cantor’s father continued to decline, he placed all his hopes on the eldest of his six children. For Cantor’s confirmation, his father wrote the 15-year-old boy a letter, warning him that many promising talents are defeated by those who resist their ideas — that only an unshakable religious conviction would prevent him from becoming another “so-called ruined genius.” In order to meet his potential as a “shining star on the horizon of science,” he would have to persevere in the face of his detractors.\n\nCantor carried his father’s letter with him for the rest of his life. He internalized its heroic view of intellectual defiance, and he soon found a place to direct his own talent: mathematics. As he put it, math was the field “toward which an unknown, secret voice calls him.” At 18, when his father died, he used his inheritance to enroll in the University of Berlin, one of the great capitals of mathematics.\n\nThere, a conflict was beginning to simmer.\n\nThe issue was infinity. Mathematicians had invented the abstraction millennia ago to deal with the problem that, for any number you name, you can always name a bigger one. But infinity came with its own problems. The ancient Greek philosopher Zeno used it to concoct all sorts of paradoxes. When infinity entered the picture, straightforward concepts like size and addition seemed to break down.\n\nInfinity also presented a religious challenge. Christian theology decreed that God must be greater than any of his creations — the only true infinity, bigger than any number. If everyday mathematicians could control this unquantifiable quantity, it would be an affront to God, and thus the authority of the Church.\n\nFor thousands of years, mathematicians evaded these hazards by agreeing that infinity is just a useful trick, not a valid mathematical entity. As the great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss put it in a letter from 1831, infinity was nothing more than a “façon de parler” — a figure of speech.\n\nBut within a few decades, infinity became harder to ignore.\n\nMathematicians were starting to revisit their most fundamental concepts, hoping to make them more precise. Even their understanding of what numbers were, they began to realize, lay on shaky foundations.\n\nUntil then, they had only thought about numbers as the answers they got when they solved equations in algebra: whole numbers, fractions, square roots. Now some of them wanted to explore how these different species all related to one another, and whether there were other species out there to discover.\n\nAmong these explorers was a quiet German mathematician named Richard Dedekind. In 1858, he found a way to rigorously define the real numbers — any number that appears on the number line. But he didn’t share his finding. A slow and methodical thinker, he preferred to discuss his results with others until he was sure he was right.\n\nIn 1870, meanwhile, Cantor, unaware of Dedekind’s work, had finished his graduate studies and was starting to examine practical questions about how certain equations behave. He wasn’t yet interested in philosophical questions about the nature of numbers, but his work led him to come up with his own definition of the real numbers.\n\nIn early 1872, Dedekind and Cantor independently published their results.\n\nThey had both done something radical: They’d redefined the number line.\n\nBefore their papers, mathematicians had assumed that even though the number line might look like a continuous object, if you zoomed in far enough, you’d eventually find gaps.\n\nTake the stretch of the number line between zero and 1. It contains infinitely many fractions: For any two fractions, you can always zoom in to find another one between them. But no matter how much you zoom in, there are certain numbers, like $latex \\sqrt{2}$, that you’ll never reach. There are gaps — the infinity is broken.\n\nIn their 1872 papers, though, Cantor and Dedekind had found a way to construct a number line that was complete. No matter how much you zoomed in on any given stretch of it, it remained an unbroken expanse of infinitely many real numbers, continuously linked.\n\nSuddenly, the monstrosity of infinity, long feared by mathematicians, could no longer be relegated to some unreachable part of the number line. It hid within its every crevice.\n\nThat summer, both Cantor and Dedekind spent their holiday in the scenic lakefront village of Gersau, Switzerland, where they crossed paths for the first time and took a long walk together to discuss their ideas.\n\nTo any spectator, the two men strolling along the lakeshore would have seemed an odd match. At 27, Cantor was tall, broad-shouldered, and boisterous. He reveled in attention from his peers, but beneath it all, he was deeply anxious about how they perceived him. It made him work fast, trying to publish quickly and often. Dedekind, on the other hand, was 13 years older than Cantor but much shorter and more reserved. And he shared none of Cantor’s urgency to publish. In fact, over the course of his life, he would publish relatively little.\n\nBut they hit it off at once. In letters they wrote later, both reminisced again and again about that beautiful day spent discussing math by the lake. They’d found in each other a partner, a friend.\n\nEver since he can remember, Demian Goos has deeply cared about the rules. In 2008, when he was 17 years old, he and his family moved from Germany, where he’d grown up, to Argentina, where his mother was from. There, Goos decided to take up refereeing. “I enjoyed playing soccer with friends,” he said — but even more than he enjoyed playing, “I always felt annoyed by injustice in sports. When I was watching a match and they got a call wrong, I wanted to contribute to getting it right.”\n\nIt gave him the chance to turn his convictions into action. For the next 15 years — during his time as an undergraduate, graduate student, and postdoctoral researcher and lecturer in mathematics at the National University of Rosario — he refereed professional games for a major regional soccer tournament. One time, he recalled, a fan in the crowd flashed a machete at him, an oblique threat. But when the fan’s team committed a foul on the following play, Goos didn’t flinch. He simply took a deep breath and pulled out his red card.\n\n“Refereeing was a really formative experience,” he said. “I don’t back down when people try to intimidate me.”\n\nThough he enjoyed mathematics research, Goos was most drawn to the stories behind the theorems. He spent his free time reading about the history of mathematical ideas and dramatically recounting the stories he’d learned for his peers at the university café, which they took to calling his “office.” As a postdoc, he sometimes took his students outside to illustrate math concepts, like optimization algorithms or chaotic systems, through interpretive dance. Many students enjoyed it, he said, but some professors warned him against using such unorthodox methods. “They probably thought they could scare me,” Goos said. “They hadn’t heard the machete story.”\n\nIn 2020, while still a postdoc, he became ill and had to travel back to Germany frequently for treatment. A couple years later, he moved back full time. Once he finished his postdoc and was in better health, he decided it was time to leave academia and pursue his love for storytelling. And so, in early 2023, he started a science journalism fellowship at the Free University of Berlin, where he focused on developing a podcast. He wanted to tell the most gripping stories in the history of mathematics.\n\nAnd he had an idea of where to start.\n\n“Since I’m the emotional guy I am, I focused on the most emotional story ever,” he said — the story of how infinity became real and led to the birth of set theory, which offered a new foundation for all of modern math. “It pushes our understanding of mathematics to its limit,” Goos said. “You have to say goodbye to mathematical intuition and just be open and receptive to all the shenanigans that you will encounter there.”\n\nHe had learned in school that Cantor was the sole founder of set theory — and that it all started with a proof he published in 1874. In that proof, Cantor showed that there are different sizes of infinity, putting to bed the notion that infinity was merely a piece of mathematical trickery.\n\nGoos began research for a podcast about Cantor’s discovery. But he soon found that the true story was more complicated than he’d been told.\n\n“My approach originally was to tell the story everybody tells. It’s a beautiful story,” he said. “But it’s a wrong story. It’s not really what happened.”\n\nThe true story was that Cantor wasn’t a lone genius. He had a partner — at least for a time.\n\nWhenever Cantor met like-minded mathematicians, he was known to court them eagerly. He would show up at a collaborator’s residence at daybreak, excited to discuss some new idea he’d had, sometimes waiting for hours until they woke up. So it was with Dedekind. After their 1872 encounter in Gersau, Cantor took every opportunity to ask the older mathematician for advice.\n\nIn November 1873, Cantor began an exchange that would forever alter the course of human knowledge. “Allow me to put a question to you,” he wrote to Dedekind in a hastily penned letter. “It has a certain theoretical interest for me, but I cannot answer it myself; perhaps you can.”\n\nCantor had found an outlet for the zealous drive his father had instilled: the infinite nature of the number line. “He had a very strong sense of mission,” said José Ferreirós, a historian and philosopher of mathematics at the University of Seville in Spain. “He was convinced that the introduction of actual infinity was going to change not only mathematics, but science in general.” To Cantor, this kind of infinity didn’t contradict God’s supremacy. It just meant that rather than being remote and unknowable, God was everywhere, residing between all things.\n\nHe began studying the real numbers as a single, infinite package, asking questions no one had thought to ask before. Was there a difference between the infinity signaled by the three dots in 1, 2, 3, … , and the one built into the mysterious continuum of the number line? In other words, were there more real numbers than whole numbers?\n\nOn its face, the question seemed nonsensical. What would it even mean for these infinite sets to be different sizes?\n\nHe asked Dedekind whether the two sets of numbers could be put in “one-to-one correspondence” — a pairing of every real number with its own distinct whole number. He’d managed to do this, he wrote, for a different set: He’d proved that the rational numbers (numbers that can be written as a fraction) could each be assigned a unique whole number, without leaving any numbers left over. That is, even though there appeared to be far more rational numbers than whole numbers, the two sets were actually the same size. Both were therefore what mathematicians would later call “countable.”\n\nBut Cantor couldn’t figure out how to compare the whole numbers to the real numbers in the same way. Dedekind quickly replied that neither could he — but that he’d worked out a proof that the algebraic numbers (the numbers you get as solutions to algebra problems) could be counted. “I would not have written all this,” Dedekind wrote to Cantor in closing, “if I did not consider it possible that one or the other remark might be useful to you.”\n\nFrom there, the mathematical volley continued. Energized by Dedekind’s progress, Cantor spent the following days plugging away at the remaining question — the real numbers. Could he finally show that, unlike the algebraic numbers, they were a bigger infinity than the whole numbers?\n\nOn December 7, 1873, he wrote to Dedekind that he thought he’d finally succeeded: “But if I should be deceiving myself, I should certainly find no more indulgent judge than you.” He laid out his proof. But it was unwieldy, convoluted. Dedekind replied with a way to simplify Cantor’s proof, building a clearer argument without losing any rigor or accuracy. Meanwhile Cantor, before he’d received Dedekind’s letter, sent him a similar idea for how to streamline the proof, though he hadn’t worked out the details the way Dedekind had.\n\nCantor considered what he had in hand: two sets, both infinite, but one somehow larger than the other. The implications were revolutionary. He began to dream of not one infinity, but an entire hierarchy of them. And if infinities could be so concretely compared, then they had to be real, not just figures of speech.\n\nHis proof, he realized, had the potential to shake the math world to its core. But not without angering some of its most prominent figures.\n\nOne of those figures was Leopold Kronecker, a mathematical ideologue who detested infinity. He didn’t believe in the number line’s packed nooks and crannies. According to the mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann, who proved that π isn’t algebraic — you can never pose an ordinary algebra problem where π is the answer — Kronecker once told him his work was worthless, since such “transcendental” numbers didn’t exist.\n\nKronecker was also a major gatekeeper in the world of math. He was on the editorial board of Crelle’s Journal, one of the world’s preeminent math publications. And he never hesitated to use his enormous influence to push his reactionary agenda. Often, he would decide which results would reach other mathematicians quickly — or at all.\n\nCantor, after discussing his work with his mentor Karl Weierstrass, wanted to publish the findings in Crelle. There, he figured, he’d be able to bring infinity into the mainstream. To reveal the mind of God to the entire world. To become a shining star on math’s horizon.\n\nCantor’s sense of mission, that “secret voice” within him, began to swell.\n\nCantor had a good relationship with Kronecker. But several years before, Dedekind had beaten Kronecker to a major result, and Kronecker’s dislike for him was well known. If Cantor submitted a paper co-authored with Kronecker’s nemesis — a paper that openly declared that multiple sizes of infinity exist — it might never get published.\n\nThe first was to build a mathematical Trojan horse.\n\nWeierstrass had been most excited about the proof that algebraic numbers are countable. (He would later use that result to prove a theorem of his own.) So Cantor chose a misleading title that only mentioned algebraic numbers.\n\nBut he saw that proof — Dedekind’s proof — as a decoy, a wedge he could use to pry open the forbidden gates of infinity. Writing his paper, Cantor put the proof about algebraic numbers first. Below it, he added his own proof that the real numbers cannot be counted — Dedekind’s simplified version of it, that is. Cantor downplayed this second section’s true import. “He deliberately chose a wording that would not sound suspicious to Kronecker and all those who hated infinity,” Goos said.\n\nCantor’s second decision was to claim full authorship for himself. He carefully erased every trace of his collaborator’s contribution, including stray uses of terms that anyone in the know would recognize as Dedekind’s.\n\nIn classic Cantor fashion, he slapped the paper together within a day and submitted it to Crelle. The following morning, Christmas Day 1873, he posted a letter to Dedekind, letting him know that Weierstrass had convinced him to publish. “As you will see,” he wrote, “your remarks, which I value highly, and your manner of putting some of the points were of great assistance to me.”\n\nThe first evidence of Cantor’s deception was uncovered in the early 20th century by another great German mathematician. Emmy Noether was a Dedekind acolyte. She would often wax poetic about his mathematical prescience. As she liked to tell her students, “Everything is already in Dedekind.” In 1930, she was collecting all of his mathematical work into a four-volume publication when she happened on some of the letters he’d kept from his correspondence with Cantor. She partnered with the French philosopher Jean Cavaillès to gather and publish them as well.\n\nIt had been over a decade since Dedekind and Cantor had died. Noether and Cavaillès spent the next few years tracking down letters from Dedekind’s estate. In 1933, after Adolf Hitler’s rise to power, Noether, who was Jewish, fled from Germany to the U.S., where she died two years later from cancer. But Cavaillès completed their project in 1937.\n\nThe correspondence as it was presented in the book was strange. It began with a flurry of letters starting shortly after Cantor and Dedekind met in 1872. The letters, from Dedekind’s estate, included only those that he’d received, not ones he’d sent to Cantor. Then the correspondence suddenly ended in January 1874, and several years of silence followed. When the exchange resumed in 1877, Dedekind’s own letters to Cantor now appeared as well. Dedekind had apparently decided to keep a copy of everything he was sending to his fellow mathematician.\n\nThere was also a note Dedekind seemed to have written to himself after he saw Cantor’s 1874 publication in Crelle. In it, he recounted how he’d sent Cantor the first proof in the paper and the revised version of the second — only to see them both appear “almost word for word” in print just a few months later under Cantor’s name alone.\n\nDedekind never went public with this claim, and Noether and Cavaillès didn’t comment on it. “I think for them it was a very conscious decision not to say anything and just to let the letters speak for themselves,” said Ferreirós, the historian in Seville. “That was the honor code of the time.”\n\nNo one else called attention to it either — at least not in print. The earliest biographies of Cantor, written by his mathematical disciples, simply lauded his genius.\n\nDecades later, historians such as Ivor Grattan-Guinness revisited the Cantor-Dedekind exchange. Grattan-Guinness tried desperately to track down the letters Dedekind had sent to Cantor in 1873 — the ones that might prove Cantor’s wrongdoing. They had supposedly been left in Cantor’s office at the University of Halle after his death, but now they were nowhere to be found. Most likely, Grattan-Guinness concluded, they’d been lost during World War II, or in the destruction that followed once American and Soviet forces occupied Halle in 1945.\n\nWithout the letters, Grattan-Guinness and his contemporaries decided not to accuse Cantor of ethical misconduct. Some decided that he’d acted with Dedekind’s permission; others excused his choice, since he’d begun the exchange and come up with the first version of the more significant second proof.\n\nBut when Goos learned of this history while working on his podcast in 2024, he was outraged. He could only find one piece of writing that explicitly discussed Cantor’s wrongdoing. In a 1993 paper, Ferreirós accused Cantor of stealing and publishing Dedekind’s work without credit. But other Cantor biographers immediately pushed back on Ferreirós’ narrative, arguing that it was too extreme an interpretation of what had happened. Besides, without Dedekind’s missing letter, there was no real proof of the supposed crime — only Dedekind’s note, written afterward. How could anyone be so sure its claims were true?\n\nIt remained an obscure debate among historians of mathematics, and Cantor’s lone-genius mystique endured.\n\nGoos wanted to tell the real story on his podcast — and to back it up. He saw one way to do that. But it was a long shot.\n\n“They were always saying the letters were lost after the war,” he said. That bothered him. “There is a lot that was lost without any doubt, but it doesn’t mean that nothing else survived.”\n\nMany great historians had searched for the letters and come up short. Goos had just started his research. But could all the experts have missed something?\n\nCantor’s paper in Crelle didn’t make a huge splash, as mathematicians largely missed what he’d hidden between the lines. But he’d landed his first blow in what would become a lifelong assault on the mathematical status quo. He’d published a proof, in math’s foremost journal, that infinity came in different sizes. It would eventually force mathematicians to rethink the foundations of the field — to decide on its most fundamental rules and their consequences.\n\nMeanwhile, Dedekind stopped replying to Cantor. For nearly three years, they didn’t correspond at all. Then, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, Dedekind cautiously reengaged. But this time, he kept a draft of every letter he sent: a record for safekeeping.\n\nThe two began discussing infinity again. Cantor was planning to follow up on his work on infinity’s many sizes, and he wanted advice. His letters were now more supplicating, Dedekind’s warier. But the correspondence was productive, and Cantor soon submitted a new, more daring paper to Crelle — this time, without a disguise.\n\nKronecker revolted. He used all his influence in the Berlin circle to delay the review process as much as possible. But after several months, Weierstrass and others interceded on Cantor’s behalf, and the paper eventually appeared in the journal.\n\nOnce again, ideas from Dedekind’s letters to Cantor appeared in the paper without credit. Once again, Dedekind cut off their correspondence.\n\nCantor would perhaps come to regret this break with one of his only intellectual allies. He’d been struggling to turn the mathematical backwater of Halle into an epicenter of the field that was growing out of his work: set theory. His best bet for achieving this was to hire Dedekind. In 1882, he tried to recruit him, as if nothing had happened. Dedekind politely declined.\n\nAs Cantor continued to publish results on infinity, Kronecker worked to turn the mathematical community against him. He called Cantor a “corruptor of the youth” and a “renegade.” When Cantor, trying to leave Halle, applied for a position at the more prestigious University of Berlin in 1883, Kronecker — a professor there — blocked his appointment. Other mathematicians, including some of Cantor’s friends, began to discourage him from publishing, too.\n\nCantor took all of this resistance personally. “He has this longing for approval,” Goos said. “But it’s the very nature of doing things differently from everybody else that they won’t like it.” In 1884, Cantor was hospitalized due to a major depressive episode. Over time, he grew more and more isolated. “There was a pattern,” Ferreirós said. “Many of his relationships with colleagues ended on bad terms.”\n\nEventually, Cantor fell victim to the opposition his father had warned him about. When he was repeatedly denied the academic posts and honors he felt he deserved, his sense of mission gave way to resentment. His depression returned, and he was hospitalized several times over the next two decades. In 1917, he was finally committed to a sanatorium, where he wrote his wife regularly, begging her to let him come home. He died the following year.\n\nCantor had been forced to the margins. But gradually his ideas began to gain traction among a new generation of mathematicians. They saw in Cantor’s work the potential to rewrite all of mathematics from the ground up.\n\nGoos, too, was looking to do some rewriting. In his 2024 podcast, he covered the conflict between Cantor and Dedekind. But having failed to unearth any new evidence, he found it difficult to shift the debate. He turned to other projects.\n\nStill, he couldn’t let the story go.\n\nHe continued to dig for clues about the lost letters in his free time. “I don’t really think there is one book left that I don’t have,” he said. He tracked down original sources and scoured university archives whenever he could. “I’m talking really about primary sources that are mentioned once in a single line in a single article,” he said.\n\nThat’s how, in the summer of 2024, he stumbled on a partial scan of what looked like a letter from Dedekind to Cantor. It was on a webpage titled “Georg-Cantor-Vereinigung” — the Georg Cantor Association. “It’s a group of people who try to keep Cantor’s memory alive,” Goos said. The letter was from 1877, long after the conflict, so Dedekind’s draft of it was already in the historical record. But there had never been any record of the copy he’d sent to Cantor. Goos tried contacting various members of the organization but got no reply.\n\nMonths later, he returned to the webpage. But this time, he noticed that below the scan, the site mentioned a 2009 donation of letters from an heir. He tracked down who that heir could possibly be, and after poring over many family trees and other documents, he finally came across a Dr. Angelika Vahlen — Cantor’s great-granddaughter, who appeared to be living in Halle.\n\nWhen he called her, she told him that she knew nothing about mathematics (she was an archaeologist, in fact), but that she’d wanted to make whatever letters she possessed available to historians for study. She had given them to the University of Halle (today formally known as Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg), and they’d ended up with the president of the Cantor Association, a math professor named Karin Richter.\n\nGoos tracked Richter down. Arrived at her office in March 2025. Opened the thin blue binder she handed him.\n\nHe’d been expecting to see the later letter from Dedekind that was posted on the Cantor Association’s website. It would be like his other pursuits of original sources — a good way to verify what was already known and perhaps glean some new insights.\n\nBut here before him was the letter he’d been hoping to find for over a year. He was sure of it. Although Dedekind’s meticulous, ornate handwriting was somehow even more indecipherable than Cantor’s uneven scrawl, Goos could see that the pages were peppered with the phrase algebraischen Zahlen: “algebraic numbers.” And at the bottom, unmistakable, was the sign-off: “With warmest regards, your most devoted R. Dedekind — Braunschweig, 30 November, 1873.”\n\nDid Richter even know what she had? He asked for scans. Richter said she’d think about it.\n\nOn the train ride back home — his second five-hour trip of the day — Goos contemplated the discovery he was sitting on. He knew the situation was delicate. He’d experienced German mathematicians’ dismissiveness when he brought up Cantor’s betrayal of Dedekind. “Pride is something that Germans don’t often feel comfortable with,” Goos said. “But we are proud of Cantor.” It would be hard to find a bigger Cantor fan than Richter, and she hadn’t seemed eager to share the scans.\n\nWhen he called Richter’s phone number two days later, his hopes sank. It was no longer in service. “How do you tell somebody this? You know, I talked to this lady, she didn’t seem really happy to share these letters, so I called her, and her phone doesn’t exist anymore,” he said. “Come on, Demian, come on!” He berated himself for being too polite to pull out his phone in Richter’s office and start taking photos.\n\nHe spent the next month contacting everyone he knew in Halle, begging them to find a way to get to Richter. “I’m starting to think I’m going crazy,” he said. “Does she even exist?” Finally, one of Richter’s colleagues told him when and where she’d be giving her next lecture. He made the 10-hour round trip again in April, and Richter explained that she’d changed phone providers. She handed him a single scan and transcription. It was just one letter, but it was the one that mattered.\n\nAnother month later, another trek, and Richter handed over another Dedekind letter, this one from the summer of 1873. Goos didn’t know if he could afford any more of these trips: “I’m not rich,” he said. It was time, he decided, to let the world know what he’d found.\n\nToday, Cantor’s renown far exceeds Dedekind’s.\n\nBoth made major contributions to the foundations of mathematics. But Cantor is often credited with wrangling infinity and inventing set theory, the language that all of modern math is now written in. His reputation as one of history’s greatest mathematicians has been bolstered by biographies and popular books, and he’s one of the few mathematicians known to people outside the world of math.\n\nThere are no English-language biographies of Dedekind. His Wikipedia page is a quarter the length of his erstwhile friend’s. Among mathematicians — largely thanks to Noether’s efforts — he retains a reputation as a lesser-known visionary. “The more I learn about Dedekind, the more impressed I am,” said Joel David Hamkins, a set theorist and philosopher at the University of Notre Dame. “Cantor proved all these great theorems, but Dedekind was probably the greater mathematician.”\n\nThe real story behind Cantor’s 1874 paper has been sitting in the open for 90 years. But it isn’t the kind of story people like to tell. “Every branch of science needs a hero,” Ferreirós said. “Chemistry has Lavoisier, mechanics has Newton, relativity has Einstein. There’s always this one, only one. But that’s always a lie.”\n\nSince challenging the lie, Goos has met resistance. When he’s shared his discovery of the lost letter, mathematicians have questioned its importance — especially in Germany. He’s had trouble getting people to see why it matters. Their reaction echoes historians’ response to Ferreirós’ paper 30 years ago.\n\nBut it does matter. Math is often viewed as the science that lives at the safest distance from the real world and its imperfections. Its truths are absolute. It values beauty and elegance above all other things. What matters is the work, the world being explored. Everything else, including authorship and credit, is secondary.\n\nBut this masks the reality of how the pursuit of scientific truth works. “Math is a collective enterprise,” Ferreirós said. “Even in the case of set theory, you don’t have this wonderful example of a single guy inventing the whole thing.”\n\nIt also masks the fact that math is done by people. It’s impossible to divorce egos and opinions and personal flaws from the work itself. “Wonderful,” Goos likes to reply to those mathematicians who dismiss Cantor’s misconduct. “The next paper you write, make it anonymous. Then we’ll see if it’s about the science.” When it comes to their own work, mathematicians are very concerned with credit. Many of them have a near-encyclopedic knowledge of who came up with which theorem, and who won which awards.\n\nThe revelation about Cantor’s result doesn’t undermine his legacy. He was still the first person to prove that there are more real numbers than whole ones, which is what ultimately opened up infinity to study. “It’s really the second theorem that’s important, in my view,” Hamkins said. And the original proof of that theorem wasn’t Dedekind’s.\n\nBut it’s still important to recognize Dedekind’s role in one of math’s greatest discoveries, and Cantor’s decision not to credit him. Ultimately, Cantor’s choices only reduce him from hero to human — a more honest picture. “Cantor was a man who did not easily connect to other people,” Richter said. “It was very, very hard for Cantor.”\n\n“He was very young, very passionate and enthusiastic,” Ferreirós said. “And he made a big mistake.”\n\nThis, in the end, is the better story — because it’s true.",

    "description": "Like the US men's hockey team, hedge funders in South Beach aren't planning to stay long.",
    "fullText": "It's always telling what the social currency of any large industry gathering is.\n\nThis week's hedge fund confab in Miami's posh South Beach stretch drew thousands of fund founders, institutional investors, lawyers, marketers, data providers, and more.\n\nIn recent years, as Miami, Palm Beach, and other South Florida hot spots have gained traction among the wealthiest New Yorkers and Californians, attendees might boast about looking at properties while in town as they weighed moving. This year, conference-goers traded pictures and videos of the US men's hockey party at the local club E11even on Monday night.\n\nThe team flew in from the host country of the Winter Olympics, Italy, and left the next morning, providing a clean metaphor for the entire week: Miami is a getaway, not a home. The annual iConnections conference brings thousands of finance pros to the city, and while Miami is still growing steadily, thanks in part to Ken Griffin's Citadel and companies like Palantir, the investing industry has yet to move en masse to the region.\n\nMany of the attendees battled the record-setting blizzard that hit New York and New England on Sunday and Monday to reach the Magic City. A person close to the conference said iConnections chartered several planes for attendees that left from New Jersey's Teterboro airport on Saturday as airlines began canceling flights in anticipation of the storm (attendees still had to pay for a seat on these flights).\n\nWithout people from out of town, the week wouldn't have nearly enough buzz. One founder of a small fund said he originally started his firm in Florida during pandemic times, but relocated to New York when things opened up.\n\n\"There wasn't enough flow, there isn't enough people yet,\" this person said.\n\nLike Dubai, the region has attracted wealthy founders and near-retirement partners seeking warm weather and low taxes. Unlike Dubai, many funds have not set up a significant presence in Miami yet, as young talent is still drawn to long-standing centers of gravity like New York and San Francisco.\n\n\"There's not trillions in sovereign wealth sloshing around Florida,\" said one fund founder in town from London who is considering a move to Dubai.\n\nThis isn't to say that Miami is shrinking — far from it. High rises are going near the waterfront, posh private schools are filled to the brim, and traffic can be a nightmare. Walking around South Beach, rows of palm trees are interrupted by construction cranes. Cutting-edge consumer tech is ever-present, as self-driving Waymos and cooler-looking delivery robots are a constant sight.\n\nBut it's still Florida, for better or worse. A billboard off of Miami's main highway, before entering the Brickell neighborhood that's home to financial services companies, features a law firm focused on DUIs committed on boats. Conference-goers trudged to a marathon day of meetings indoors while vacationers in swimsuits and perma-tan retirees passed them on their way to the beach.\n\nIt makes for a perfect conference environment, and hedge funds are as hot as they've ever been. Institutions such as pensions and sovereign wealth funds want to up their allocations, while private wealth channels are trying to get more capacity in the biggest brands in the industry. Fundraisers and backers were in back-to-back, speed-dating-like meetings in the heavily air-conditioned convention center — one fund executive said they had 35 different meetings over Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe speaking lineup wasn't as celebrity-and-billionaire-filled as years past, when Point72 founder Steve Cohen, basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, venture investor Peter Thiel, and reality TV star Kim Kardashian have all spoken, but there were still heavy hitters in town. Jefferies CEO Rich Handler was at the firm's Tuesday night event at the Kimpton Surfcomber hotel, attendees said. Billionaire Third Point founder Dan Loeb spoke about the return of short selling during a panel.\n\nIn these talks and in conversations all week, Miami was the setting, not the main subject. New York and Silicon Valley, for all the handwringing about the high-tax areas, are still the main characters.\n\nEveryone had a blizzard photo to share from their homes in New York or Connecticut. At a yacht party in Miami Beach harbor Tuesday night, New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani and California Gov. Gavin Newsom were discussed more than President Donald Trump, despite it being the night of the State of the Union. Florida and Miami politicians and policies didn't come up — including Eileen Higgins, the city's first female mayor, elected late last year — beyond the costs of insuring a home near the beach.\n\nIn the lobbies and bars of nearby luxury hotels and resorts like the Ritz-Carlton, The Setai, Soho Beach House, and more, out-of-towners bemoaned the rough weather of the Northeast and high taxes of California and London while checking into their flights home.\n\n\"This place still doesn't feel real,\" one family-office head based in the Northeast said over drinks at a beachside hotel.",

    "description": "Greg Brockman, the president at OpenAI, said the company has a sense of \"mortality\" because of Sam Altman's brief 2023 firing.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI president Greg Brockman said the five days in November 2023 after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired felt like a revolution.\n\n\"I cannot capture the intensity of this time,\" Brockman said during an episode of the Tetragrammaton with Rick Rubin podcast published on Thursday.\n\nOn November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board ousted Altman and removed Brockman as board chairman. Brockman said he learned of the decision during a Google Meet video call — and resigned that day from his position as president.\n\n\"For me, I knew in that moment it wasn't right,\" he said about Altman's firing. \"After hanging up the call, I told my wife and said, 'We have to leave.' And she said, 'Yes, we do.'\"\n\nTheir ousters sparked a \"chaotic\" frenzy, Brockman added, in which OpenAI employees and investors, fueled by \"caffeine energy,\" mobilized nearly instantly to bring their bosses back.\n\nThe board initially appointed CTO Mira Murati as interim CEO. Days later, she was replaced by former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear — a move Brockman said made the company go \"wild.\"\n\n\"People started to leave the office — just streaming out of the office,\" he said. \"Everyone was like, 'We just need to be out of here and be gone.'\"\n\nEmployees canceled their Thanksgiving plans and gathered at homes around the Bay Area, packing into backyards to give speeches about what to do next, Brockman said.\n\nBrockman said about 95% of OpenAI employees signed a petition demanding the board reinstate both him and Altman. He said the show of support was so overwhelming that it temporarily crashed Google Docs.\n\n\"They had to have some people who were designated as the person to add to the Google Doc,\" he said. \"It was a whole crazy thing.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said competing companies were trying to scoop up OpenAI's talent. Even Altman was thinking about starting his own company — and Brockman said Microsoft was interested in investing.\n\n\"Everyone was trying to figure out, 'Is this company somewhere I want to be?'\" Brockman said.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, Brockman said the moment also felt rejuvenating.\n\n\"It was great energy, honestly,\" he said. \"We were so jazzed about this because it was an opportunity to — really anything that we wanted to rethink, now was the moment.\"\n\nAltman was reinstated as CEO on November 22 after intense pressure from investors and employees.\n\nMany times, Greg has shown clear conviction in doing whatever he thought would be important to defend the mission and people of OpenAI, especially when it was hard. Here he talks about many of those moments. https://t.co/SPhqX6TTJl\n\nLooking back, Brockman said his biggest lesson was how to handle internal disagreement.\n\n\"I think that one thing we did wrong was that we let conflict brew,\" he said. \"People disagree, that's normal, that happens — but if you let it fester, that's always going to be more painful down the road.\"\n\nBrockman added that the company now has a \"feeling of mortality\" that keeps employees motivated.\n\n\"It's not pre-ordained that it succeeds,\" he said. \"The thing that is most likely to get in the way of success is tripping over ourselves.\"\n\nBrockman also defended Altman's character, calling him a \"good person\" who is \"very misunderstood by the world.\"",

    "description": "The Supreme Court struck down one set of tariffs only for President Trump to slap new ones on. It's a bit of relief for CEOs, but not a complete fix.",
    "fullText": "When the Supreme Court struck down a major pillar of President Donald Trump's tariff policy last week, \"there were no big fireworks that went off\" at Stew Leonard's, the New York-based grocery chain's CEO, Stew Leonard Jr., told Business Insider.\n\nThe retailer relies on international vendors for products such as New Zealand lamb and European wines and cheeses, and it has raised prices on items that were affected over the last year, citing import costs, Leonard said.\n\nWhile eliminating tariffs entirely would have provided some relief for low-margin businesses like Leonard's, Trump immediately vowed to impose similar costs under a different legal framework.\n\n\"The tariff thing you got to play almost day by day,\" Leonard said. \"Even talking to our suppliers, if I asked them for any prediction, they have no idea.\"\n\nMichigan State University supply chain professor Jason Miller told Business Insider that the new 10% base rate tariff represents a modest reduction in costs for some products, especially those from China, India, and Brazil, but that the 15% rate could end up being more expensive than some previously negotiated trade deals.\n\n\"We're back to this very elevated level of uncertainty, and that is going to again create questions for firms,\" he said. \"Do they move ahead with courses of action, or do they pause?\"\n\nFederal investigations are also underway into other tariff frameworks that could result in even higher fees for certain items containing aluminum, steel, and other materials if the government decides to change how it calculates those rates.\n\n\"That is the big concern right now, but we don't know what that looks like yet,\" Miller said.\n\nConsumer companies' earnings calls this week included several new estimates of the financial hit tariffs have represented to their profits over the past year, but hardly any of their executives said they were immediately adjusting their strategies in response to the flurry of changes.\n\nFootwear maker Steve Madden went further than most, opting on Wednesday to pull its financial forecasts \"until there's more clarity around tariffs.\"\n\nJing Gao, founder and CEO of Fly By Jing, told Business Insider her Chinese food brand is still trying to understand the full picture of how it will be affected under the new (and changing) rules.\n\n\"It's important for us not to make major, potentially irreversible decisions without understanding the full landscape,\" she said over email.\n\nIn particular, she said she has no plans to shift the sourcing of her Sichuan chili crisp supplies to the US: \"You can't grow these ingredients in America.\"\n\nAnother wrinkle for importers is that the law Trump is using for this latest round of tariffs (Section 122) has a 150-day limit, unless Congress extends it.\n\n\"The impact of the tariffs remains largely unchanged for now, but the 150-day countdown adds another layer of uncertainty,\" Gao said. \"This kind of volatility is especially disruptive.\"\n\nFedEx used the Supreme Court's decision to join the list of companies suing the government over the now-illegal tariff charges; however, the CEOs who spoke with Business Insider aren't rushing to get refunds.\n\nCaleb Nicholes, co-owner of Wisconsin-based Wonderstate Coffee, told Business Insider his company paid $140,000 in tariff charges in 2025 before coffee beans received an exemption in November. (The new order excludes many of the same items, like bananas and coffee, that were previously exempted under the overturned rules.)\n\n\"These political experiments are having real-time implications on the sustainability of our business,\" Nicholes said. \"We don't have a lot of room to play around with these kinds of $140,000 bills that are getting thrown around.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's latest ruling gave Nicholes the opportunity to explore legal action, such as joining a potential class action lawsuit, to secure a refund of Wonderstate's tariff payments. It's a bureaucratic battle that could drag on for years, he said.\n\nNot everyone is so willing to take on the government, especially if, like Stew Leonard, they have already found ways to mitigate those costs.\n\n\"We're just looking forward right now,\" Leonard, the grocer, said. \"I wouldn't really look at waging a lawsuit against the government.\"",

    "description": "Dell said it has had \"a defining year\" and projected that server sales would grow 103% in its 2027 financial year.",
    "fullText": "Dell is the latest company to get a massive windfall from the AI boom.\n\nThe tech company reported record annual revenue of $113.5 billion on Thursday, up 19% in its financial year ending January 30.\n\nJeff Clarke, Dell's vice chairman and chief operating officer, said it had been \"a defining year for the company\" in an earnings call on Thursday.\n\nAnnual revenue in the company's Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which sells servers and storage infrastructure, was up 40% across the financial year, and Dell projected sales would continue to surge in 2027.\n\nThe Texas-based company said it expected AI-optimized server sales to grow 103% and deliver $50 billion in revenue in the current financial year.\n\nDell's shares were up more than 10% in premarket trading on Friday morning as investors cheered the blockbuster results.\n\nA recent slew of similarly strong earnings results from industry leaders like Nvidia and Meta have helped calm investors' fears of an impending \"AI bubble.\"\n\n\"The AI opportunity is meaningfully growing and transforming the company,\" said Clarke in a press release.\n\n\"We closed more than $64 billion in AI optimized server orders, shipped more than $25 billion throughout the year, and are entering FY27 with record backlog of $43 billion — powerful proof that our engineering leadership and differentiated AI solutions are winning,\" said Clarke.\n\nAlongside competitors like HP and Lenovo, Dell raised product prices across both its divisions in December amid industry-wide shortages of key storage and memory components that power AI.\n\nThe increases led to some \"sticker shock\" for Dell's servers and storage customers, Clarke said on the call. However, they quickly grasped \"the gravity of the situation,\" and the \"most sophisticated customers in the world began to move aggressively to protect their infrastructure build outs,\" he said.\n\nDell's business is split into two key divisions: the Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which sells storage and servers, and the Client Solutions Group (CSG), which sells PC and other hardware.\n\nWhile Dell's AI business is booming, its traditional PC line has been struggling. In July, Clarke announced he would take on \"day-to-day leadership\" of the CSG division to \"help accelerate decision-making and build momentum.'\n\nIn the 2026 financial year, annual revenue in CSG grew by 5% — an increase compared to last year, when revenue in the division declined by 1%.\n\nAs Dell positions itself for the future, it has been reshaping operations across the board, from headcount to the tools employees use.\n\nThe changes have included a 25,000 reduction in staff numbers, in the last two years — an almost 20% drop, RTO mandates, and significant changes to how sales staff earn commission, as Business Insider reported exclusively in February.\n\nDell is also preparing for a major overhaul of its internal systems in May, which it told staff will be the \"biggest transformation in company history,\" according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider in January.\n\nThe goal is to modernize and standardize the underlying infrastructure that Dell runs on to help prepare it for the AI future.\n\nDo you work at Dell?

    "description": "Block CEO Jack Dorsey said he's cutting nearly half his staff following a significant uptick in AI capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Block be nimble/Block be quick/Jack thinks cutting nearly half his staff because of AI will do the trick.\n\nBlock CEO Jack Dorsey announced he's cutting nearly half his staff, axing more than 4,000 of the company's 10,000 employees. It's a drastic move, especially considering Block is doing fine as a business, according to Dorsey.\n\n\"we're not making this decision because we're in trouble. our business is strong,\" Dorsey said in a lengthy post on X, a company he cofounded under its old moniker, Twitter. (You can read the full memo here.)\n\nSo what prompted Dorsey to cut his workforce almost in half overnight? Artificial intelligence.\n\n\"The core thesis is simple. Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company,\" Dorsey wrote in a letter to shareholders.\n\nOn the company's earnings call, Dorsey said he noticed a significant uptick in AI capabilities late last year. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja added that engineer output is now up 40% thanks to AI. Dorsey also said the company's still in the market for senior AI engineering talent. (You and everybody else.)\n\nInstead of dragging things out with incremental cuts, Dorsey deemed it better to get it over with. \"i'd rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,\" Dorsey wrote on X.\n\nHow are those affected reacting? A data analyst who survived three rounds of layoffs at Block found out he was losing his job while in the middle of interviewing someone for a role at the company. He told BI that he saw AI automating his work — and it ended his time at Block.\n\nAnd don't get comfortable. Dorsey doesn't think he'll be the last CEO to take such dramatic actions.\n\nBlock's layoffs come as predicting AI doom and gloom is all the rage.\n\nFrom the ongoing SaaSpocalypse to a viral essay about AI disrupting jobs to another viral research report predicting a market crash and mass unemployment, optimism is not high these days.\n\nAnd right on cue, a company guts its staff, citing AI as the reason. It could serve as a bleak preview of a new era of doomsday layoffs.\n\nOne could argue that pointing the finger at AI is easier than acknowledging that things at Block are not actually fine. Before the announcement, the company's stock was down more than 80% from its 2021 highs. This year, shares were down by more than 16% before the news.\n\nBut Block's not alone in its struggles, as the broader fintech industry has taken a bath since its post-pandemic highs. Block's most recent earnings report also beat estimates and included a beefed-up outlook for gross profit in 2026.\n\nUltimately, the nuances of what's driving Block's cuts might not matter. Dorsey's decision to make preemptive cuts is bound to prompt other executives to rethink their own headcounts. (It's a copy-cat league, after all.)\n\nThe most unmistakable evidence that Block might be the first of many is the endorsement it received from a group that executives are always eager to please: investors. Block's stock was up around 18% in pre-market trading.",

In that time, only one midfielder has scored more goals.\n\nNo defender has produced more FPL points in the last four Gameweeks than the 33 of City's Nico O'Reilly (£5.0m). He has produced three goals and a clean sheet in that period, and last week scored two goals while being deployed as a central midfielder. He is consequently the most transferred-in player ahead of Gameweek 28.\n\nSolly March, Adam Webster and Stefanos Tzimas look to be Brighton's only injury concerns, as Fabian Hurzeler confirmed James Milner only suffered with cramp in the win at Brentford last weekend.\n\nPlayers out: Brighton - March, Webster, Tzimas Nottingham Forest - TBC\n\nIn the last six home matches, only four defenders have produced more FPL points than Brighton's Jan Paul van Hecke (£4.4m), with 33.\n\nElliot Anderson (£5.4m) has earned extra defensive contribution points in 20 out of 27 Gameweeks for Nottingham Forest so far this season.\n\nForest's Nikola Milenkovic (£5.1m) has amassed 28 points in his last six outings, thanks to three clean sheets and six defensive contribution points.\n\nFor Spurs, Kevin Danso and Pedro Porro are back, while Micky van de Ven is expected to play despite a finger injury.\n\nHead coach Igor Tudor is still without a huge number of first team players though, while captain Cristian Romero is serving a suspension.\n\nPlayers out: Fulham - TBC Spurs - Odobert, Udogie, Bergvall, Davies, Bentancur, Kudus, Maddison, Kulusevski\n\nHarry Wilson (£5.9m) has scored six of his eight league goals this season at Craven Cottage, where he is averaging 5.8 points per start.\n\nFulham's Raul Jimenez (£6.1m) converted his 13th successive Premier League penalty in Gameweek 27, giving him the best unblemished record in the division.\n\nIn the last six Gameweeks, only one midfielder has created more chances (17) than Tottenham's Xavi Simons (£6.5m).\n\nTeam news to appear here later on Friday.\n\nThe 78 chances created by Bruno Fernandes (£9.9m) this season is 27 more than the next-best midfielder, while his 19 big chances created for Manchester United also leads the way.\n\nSince returning from the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), Bryan Mbeumo (£8.7m) has produced attacking returns in five Gameweeks out of six for United, amassing 41 points.\n\nNew Crystal Palace captain Dean Henderson (£5.0m) marked Gameweek 27 with a penalty save and a clean sheet for his first double-digit haul of the season. He is the second-highest scoring goalkeeper in the game with 109 points.\n\nTeam news to appear here later on Friday.\n\nArsenal's Jurrien Timber (£6.4m) produced his fifth assist of the season in Gameweek 27 – only three defenders have more. Yet the second-highest scoring defender in the game is the third most transferred-out player ahead of Gameweek 28.\n\nIn the last four Gameweeks, no forward has scored as many goals as the Gunners' Viktor Gyokeres (£8.8m, four).\n\nChelsea forward Joao Pedro (£7.7m) has produced 10 attacking returns in his last six matches, amassing 55 points.",

    "fullText": "Erling Haaland travels to the city of his birth on Saturday when Manchester City visit Leeds in the Premier League (17:30 GMT).\n\nAnd with more points that any other player in FPL, he remains a standout pick as a captain.\n\nHowever, with City set to be one of three clubs without a fixture in Gameweek 31 - meaning their players will score zero points that week - do you stick or twist with the Norway forward?\n\nFPL expert Prasun Singhal and some of the team from the FPL Podcast assess the best options for Gameweek 28.\n\nSinghal: \"Haaland started the season valued at £14m but his price has risen to £14.8m. If you want him back for the run-in, which could include a double gameweek at some point, that will be so much more expensive to do.\n\n\"Even if Haaland isn't the best choice at the moment, it's not like other premium priced players are putting their hand up.\n\n\"Mohamed Salah has not scored in nine weeks and Bukayo Saka is also a confirmed blank for Gameweek 31 with the Carabao Cup final, so would you want to use precious transfers up?\n\n\"That said, in his past nine starts, Haaland has exceeded six points just once, and he now has just one open play goal in the past 10 games.\n\nChris Sutton: \"Leeds are excellent at home. It was a close game earlier this season at City, when things turned around after they had put Dominic Calvert-Lewin on.\n\n\"I don't know with Erling Haaland, because with Leeds being his dad's former team, will he want to score?

    "fullText": "Double-digit temperatures, lighter evenings and the return of the Netball Super League - winter is beginning its retreat.\n\nSeason two in the league's 10-year drive towards full professionalisation has arrived, with first-time champions London Pulse launching their defence against Manchester Thunder on Friday, 27 February at the Copper Box.\n\nPulse have handed back one trophy already, with Loughborough Lightning winning the Super Cup final in Sheffield.\n\nThose two sides, who also contested the Grand Final last July, are setting the highest standards, but others could credibly join them in the 2026 campaign.\n\nThere are new kits, new faces, and new stories waiting to be written.\n\nLondon Mavericks and Nottingham Forest feature in the first BBC live game of the 2026 NSL season on Saturday, 28 February (14:00 GMT). You can watch the action unfold on the BBC Sport website and iPlayer.\n\nIt is not 'death to the dress' yet, but several Mavericks players will break with tradition and wear a combination of vests, shorts, skorts and leggings this season. The theory is that if players feel their best, they will produce their best netball.\n\nAs coach Tamsin Greenway told BBC Sport: \"It's a bit of a no-brainer. We're women, we've all got different shapes and sizes. As a 20-year-old, wearing a dress would have been fine for me, but if you put me on court now I couldn't think of anything worse than wearing a netball dress.\"\n\nThe return of England goal shooter Eleanor Cardwell is one to watch. She is back at Manchester Thunder after enjoying huge highs and crushing lows in a mixed three years in Australia. Thunder looked rusty at the recent Super Cup, so it could be a slow build for them this season, but Cardwell adds quality. They should be there or thereabouts.\n\nAfter a 45% surge in average attendances last season, NSL is looking to draw in even more spectators. Three double-headers will take place at major arenas in Nottingham and Liverpool, while the Grand Final will move from London's O2 to Manchester's Co-op Live, a new setting for netball. Two other venues will stage netball for the first time: the National Cycling Centre in Manchester and Essex Sports Arena.\n\nFree-to-air netball stays on the BBC\n\nYou can watch live NSL matches on the BBC Sport website and iPlayer this season. Director of BBC Sport Alex Kay-Jelski said: \"It's fast, physical and uncompromising, and we'll be there every week, right at the heart of it.\"\n\nLightning strike to deny Pulse another Super Cup\n\nSkirts, skorts and leggings - why netball kits are getting a new look\n\nPulse beat Lightning to win first Netball Super League title\n\nEleanor Cardwell (Manchester Thunder): The 31-year-old goal shooter is beginning a third spell with Thunder. Expectations are high.\n\nCardwell was a 2023 World Cup silver medallist with England and has league title medals from the NSL and Australia's Super Netball.\n\nHer championship season down under came with Adelaide Thunderbirds, before knee trouble spoiled her time at Melbourne Mavericks.\n\nThunder finished third last season. All eyes are on their fit-again star signing.\n\nJaz Brown (Leeds Rhinos): Once a promising tennis player, Doncaster-born Brown is now better known for guarding nets than striking forehands over them.\n\nEngland's new goal keeper is enjoying being back in Yorkshire after leaving Birmingham Panthers.\n\nBrown, 24, forms part of a new-look Leeds defensive circle, with South African defender Sanmarie Visser another arrival.\n\n\"We're building a good combination,\" Brown said after a semi-final Super Cup run.\n\nGracie Smith (London Pulse): Aged just 16, Smith last year became the youngest ever player on an NSL title-winning team. The Pulse centre did her GCSEs three weeks before the Grand Final.\n\nAlready summoned by England A, could Smith, now 17, challenge for senior selection in time for the Commonwealth Games?\n\nShe has enjoyed almost non-stop success, so it stung when Pulse were beaten in the Super Cup final.\n\n\"I don't like losing,\" she told BBC Sport. \"It's a feeling I don't want to feel again.\"\n\nWhat is it like to be the youngest player in the Netball Super League?\n\n'I thought my career was over - I felt like punching a wall'\n\nEight teams make up the NSL: Birmingham Panthers, Dragons (previously Cardiff Dragons), Leeds Rhinos, London Mavericks, London Pulse, Loughborough Lightning, Manchester Thunder and Nottingham Forest.\n\nThey play each other home and away\n\nFour matches take place each week, with 14 rounds of games in the regular season\n\nTeams finishing in the top four qualify for the post-season stage, with a shot at becoming champions. The top two contest the 'major' semi-final where the winner progresses directly to the Grand Final\n\nThird plays fourth in the 'minor' semi-final, and the winner faces the losing side from the 'major' semi-final for a place in the Grand Final, which takes place on 20 June.\n\nSeveral eye-catching rules were introduced last year and remain for 2026.\n\nSuper shot: Shooters can score two-point shots from a certain area of the shooting circle. This rule comes into play during the final five minutes of all four quarters\n\nNo draws: Matches go to a 10-minute period of extra time if scores are level after 60 minutes\n\nTimeouts: Each team can call one 90-second tactical timeout per game. These must be called by a player on court, and only after a goal has been scored\n\nLosing bonuses: One league table point goes to teams who lose a game but finish within five points of their opponents.\n\nBBC Sport will show one game per week during the regular season.\n\nThese are the games you can watch live on the BBC Sport website and iPlayer:\n\n28 February: London Mavericks v Nottingham Forest (14:00 GMT)\n\n7 March: Manchester Thunder v London Mavericks (17:00 GMT)\n\n15 March: Nottingham Forest v Leeds Rhinos (16:00 GMT)\n\n22 March: London Pulse v Nottingham Forest (18:00 GMT)\n\n28 March: Loughborough Lightning v Birmingham Panthers (18:30 GMT)\n\n4 April: London Pulse v Birmingham Panthers (17:00 BST)\n\n11 April: Dragons v Birmingham Panthers (16:00 BST)\n\n18 April: Loughborough Lightning v London Mavericks (18:00 BST)\n\nTelevised games in weeks 9-14 will be announced at a later date.\n\nSuper League 2.0 - how has netball's relaunch gone?\n\n'Two concussions in a month was scary and it's why I'm retiring'\n\n'Ten days in Lionesses' den and I wanted to stay forever'",

    "description": "American sympathies in the Middle East have shifted dramatically toward the Palestinians, according to new Gallup polling, after decades of overwhelming support for the Israelis.  Three years ago, 54%...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — American sympathies in the Middle East have shifted dramatically toward the Palestinians, according to new Gallup polling, after decades of overwhelming support for the Israelis.\n\nThat shift accelerated during the war in Gaza. Three years ago, 54% of Americans sympathized more with the Israelis, compared to 31% for the Palestinians.\n\nNow, their support is about evenly balanced, with 41% saying their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians, and only 36% saying the same about the Israelis.\n\nThe numbers reflect how support for Israel has become deeply contentious in the U.S., with profound implications for American politics and foreign policy. The changing sentiment has been largely driven by Democrats, who are now much more likely to sympathize with Palestinians. U.S. assistance to Israel has been a major dividing line in the party’s primaries this year.\n\nGallup’s data indicates that the shift was already happening before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, then increased during Israel’s subsequent military operations in Gaza. The polling has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, meaning sentiment toward Israelis and Palestinians are roughly even.\n\n“It’s the first time they have reached parity, which is really quite striking,” said Benedict Vigers, a senior global news writer at Gallup. “In not many years, that very significant gap in public opinion has now completely closed.”\n\nAbout two-thirds of Democrats now say their concerns lie more with the Palestinians, while only about 2 in 10 sympathize more with the Israelis. As recently as 2016, the picture looked very different: About half of Democrats sympathized more with the Israelis and only about one-quarter sympathized with the Palestinians.\n\nThe shift began even before the Israel-Hamas war turned the issue into a flash point within the Democratic Party. Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the initial attack and took another 251 hostage, but the Israeli response has been widely seen as disproportionate, with Gaza health officials reporting more than 72,000 Palestinians killed, nearly half of them women and children, and wide swaths of the territory reduced to rubble. Many progressive politicians and activists now describe Israel’s actions in the war as genocide — a charge Israel vehemently denies.\n\nDemocrats have expressed greater sympathy for the Palestinians than the Israelis since 2023 — in a Gallup poll that was conducted before the Oct. 7 attacks — but Gallup’s surveys show their support in the conflict has been tilting toward the Palestinians and away from the Israelis since around 2017.\n\nSome of that early decline in sympathy appeared to be tied to disapproval of the right-leaning Israeli leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose favorability in the U.S. fell nearly 15 percentage points between 2017 and 2024, according to separate Gallup polling.\n\nNetanyahu clashed with former President Barack Obama in the last year of his administration, then forged a warmer relationship with President Donald Trump, who delivered several victories to Netanyahu in his first term, including recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Trump also persuaded three Arab countries to establish commercial and diplomatic ties with Israel. The closeness between Trump and Netanyahu has continued into Trump’s second term.\n\nThe conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians was a point of tension for Democrats during President Joe Biden’s administration, as well as during the 2024 presidential election. An AP-NORC poll conducted toward the end of 2023, just a few months into the war in Gaza, found that Democrats were sharply divided on whether the U.S. was too supportive of Israel, and another AP-NORC poll from 2024 found that Democratic voters were more likely to say the Israeli government held “a lot” of responsibility for the war’s escalation.\n\nDemocrats’ sympathy for the Palestinians intensified as the war progressed, Gallup’s polling shows, and independents’ views also shifted. This year, independents expressed more sympathy for the Palestinians than the Israelis for the first time in Gallup’s trend. About 4 in 10 independents are more sympathetic toward the Palestinians. That’s compared to about 3 in 10 for the Israelis, a new low.\n\nMost Republicans continue to side with Israel — about 7 in 10 say they are more sympathetic to the Israelis — but that is a slight downtick from about 8 in 10 before the start of the war. Some figures in the Republicans’ isolationist “America First” wing are also increasingly questioning traditional U.S. support for Israel.\n\nYounger adults — those 18 to 34 in this poll — are also increasingly sympathetic toward the Palestinians, according to the Gallup survey.\n\nYounger Americans’ sympathies have been shifting toward the Palestinians since around 2020, and reached a new high this year. About half of 18 to 34 year olds say they have more sympathy for the Palestinians, compared to about a quarter who say that about the Israelis.\n\nStudent protests against the Israel-Hamas war appeared on college campuses around the country during the war, asking colleges to cut investments supporting Israel.\n\nBut the shift is only “partly a generational story,” according to Vigers.\n\nThe new poll also found for the first time that middle-aged Americans, those 35 to 54, expressed more sympathy for the Palestinians than the Israelis — a reversal from last year. And while Americans over 55 are more sympathetic toward Israel, that gap is narrowing, too.\n\n“With adults over 55, they are more sympathetic to Israelis, but it’s as low as it’s been since 2005,” Vigers said.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults, 57%, favor the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, according to the new polling. That’s not significantly different from recent years, as at least half of U.S. adults have supported an independent Palestinian state since 2020.\n\nVigers notes that “party polarization is at or near its record high” on this question, even though it hasn’t been sharply increasing year over year.\n\nIn the last few years, there’s been an uptick among Democrats and independents in support for the two-state solution. Now, about three-quarters of Democrats and roughly 6 in 10 independents say they support an independent Palestinian state. Only about one-third of Republicans say the same.\n\nThe opinions of the people who would be directly affected by a two-state solution are quite different. Only about 3 in 10 Israelis living in Israel and Palestinians living in the West Bank and east Jerusalem said they supported a two-state solution in which an independent Palestinian state existed alongside Israel, according to the Gallup World Poll conducted in 2025.\n\n“On the ground, in the region, far fewer Israelis and Palestinians tell us that they are in favor of the two-state solution than Americans when asked a very similar question,” Vigers said. “There is that interesting sort of disconnect between the region itself and Americans’ views toward it.”\n\nAamer Madhani contributed to this report.\n\nThe Gallup poll was conducted Feb. 2-16, 2026, among 1,001 U.S. adults, aged 18 and older, using a sample drawn from Gallup’s probability-based panel. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points.",

    "fullText": "The Northern Ireland Football League has confirmed that the upcoming BetMcLean Cup final between Linfield and Glentoran will see Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology used for the first time in Northern Ireland domestic football.\n\nThe decider between Belfast rivals Linfield and Glentoran will be played at Windsor Park on Sunday, 15 March at 15:00 GMT.\n\n\"This milestone represents a significant step forward for domestic football, aligning the league more closely with European competition standards,\" read a statement released by NIFL on Friday.\n\n\"While VAR will not replace the authority or judgment of the on-field referee, it will serve as a technological support mechanism aimed at enhancing decision-making accuracy, fairness, and transparency in key match incidents.\n\n\"The fixture will be officiated by Irish FA match officials on the field of play. However, VAR operations for this match will be managed by experienced referees from outside Northern Ireland using the Hawk-Eye system, as used in Fifa and Uefa competitions, ensuring technical proficiency during this introductory phase.\"\n\nThe statement explained that the cup final would \"provide an ideal controlled environment to evaluate operational procedures, communication protocols, and overall integration of VAR into the domestic matchday framework\".\n\nThe experience gained is set to inform any future decisions the governing body will make regarding potential broader implementation of VAR across NIFL competitions.\n\nNIFL chief executive Gerard Lawlor acknowledged that the decision would not attract support from all quarters but highlighted the benefits of using the technology.\n\n\"The introduction of VAR for this game represents an important step forward for our league, strengthening decision-making and supporting our match officials,\" he said.\n\n\"We recognise, however, that this will not be a universally popular decision and that the implementation of any new technology brings scrutiny and adjustment.\n\n\"This game represents a valuable opportunity for us to assess and become familiar with the technology in a controlled environment, while providing practical benefits to both the Referee Team and our clubs, particularly those participating in European competitions where its use may be required.\"\n\nIrish FA Head of Refereeing Andrew Davey added: \"The use of VAR in the BetMcLean Cup Final is an exciting step forward for both the league and refereeing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"The introduction of this technology for such a significant fixture underlines our ongoing efforts to support referees with the highest standards of officiating tools available.\"",

    "description": "Wigan Warriors win their opening three Super League games as they look to regain the title they won in 2023 and 2024.",
    "fullText": "It is a long and winding road towards Super League's Grand Final at Old Trafford in October.\n\nBut even at this early stage of the 2026 campaign, Wigan Warriors look in determined mood to make sure they are there for a fourth straight season.\n\nHowever, after relinquishing their crown last year to Hull KR, Matt Peet's Warriors have begun in ominous form with three straight wins.\n\nThe latest was a 54-0 nine-try demolition of neighbours Leigh Leopards - not so much a \"Battle of the Borough\", more a breeze.\n\nBut what is motivating the Warriors to have come out of the blocks so quickly?\n\nInstead it was the Robins on top of the perch as they won a fantastic treble to shake up the old established order.\n\nCurrently, Hull KR are basking in their new status as Super League winners and most recently World Club Champions, after an exciting victory over NRL Premiers Brisbane Broncos.\n\nThis week, the side from east Hull are taking in the sights of Las Vegas as they gear up for their game with Leeds Rhinos at Allegiant Stadium, home of NFL side Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nBut those exploits have allowed Wigan to get six points ahead of them in the bread-and-butter of the league. Early days yes, but the laser focus of the Warriors is clear to see.\n\n\"Matty challenged us to be ruthless and we got a pretty ruthless performance tonight,\" full-back Jai Field told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\nAfter a solid win at Castleford Tigers in matchday one, Wigan have racked up 88 points in two home victories over Hull FC and then the Leopards in the space of five days.\n\nAnd while Field and star half-backs Bevan French and Harry Smith have looked in the mood, the defence has given up just one try in 160 minutes of play.\n\n\"We bowed out in the Grand Final last year, but we wanted to fix up a few things that snuck into our game at the back end of last season,\" said Field.\n\n\"Matty has challenged us this year. Training has been a little more intense, not getting away with things we probably brushed over last year.\n\n\"Everyone is being kept accountable.\"\n\nFor captain Liam Farrell, this is a 17th Super League campaign with the Cherry-and-Whites.\n\nHe has a cupboard full of silverware but it does not stop the 35-year-old from wiping the slate clean every year and going again.\n\nFarrell has stepped into the centres after an early injury to Jake Wardle and he has noticed how quickly his side has come out of the traps.\n\n\"I am hoping it's only the start,\" he said. \"It's not usually a good sign if you're playing so well at the beginning of the year.\n\n\"I'm hoping we're going to improve from this. That's a scary thought if we're going to improve from here.\n\n\"Hopefully we do. We'll take on the year and see where we end up.\"\n\nAnd if Wigan can step it up from these early weeks, that indeed is a scary prospect for Super League's other 13 clubs.",

    "title": "So much for three-year plan - what is the secret to manager longevity?",
    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains why it is so hard for football managers to keep their jobs in the modern game.",
    "fullText": "Last week, on a cold night in Glasgow, Celtic boss Martin O'Neill joined a very select club of managers who have been in charge for 1,000 professional games.\n\nThe League Managers Association (LMA) Hall of Fame 1,000 club is something I'm proud to be a member of too - there are only 40 of us, including Sir Alex Ferguson, Ron Atkinson, Jim Smith, Dave Bassett, Harry Redknapp, Graham Taylor, Brian Clough and Sam Allardyce.\n\nIt's getting harder to last that long, though. Far more managers are getting sacked, and more often, than there were when I started out, and for more than half of them, their first job is also their last.\n\nAccording to the LMA, there have been 165 first-time managers since 1 January 2013, and to date 56% of them haven't got another manager's job.\n\nIn England now, the average time a manager is given at a club in the top four divisions of our men's game is one year and nine months, which is up from the end of the last season, when it was one year and four months, but is still crazy.\n\nGone are the days where you could get a job and think about building something - it seems to be more about survival now.\n\nLongevity is highest in the Premier League, where the average time you get is more than two years, but it drops in the Football League - which is part of the reason why I'd definitely recommend that, given the opportunity, young coaches today should seriously look at jobs abroad, especially in Scandinavian countries for example, if they have the chance.\n\nMartin, who turns 74 on Sunday, reached his milestone with Celtic, a club he adores, so it must have been something special.\n\nI reached my 1,000th game with West Brom in 2016, and it came against my former club Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, as it was then. As I said at the time, you could not have scripted it better.\n\nLike many managers of his generation who began lower down the pyramid, Martin started at the bottom of the ladder, in non-league.\n\nIt was looked on as good grounding and experience for managers who would go on to get jobs in our top division.\n\nIt was the same in Scotland too, where you would cut your teeth at smaller clubs before moving onwards and upwards - all of the names I mentioned earlier followed the same path, as did Bill Shankly and Howard Wilkinson. It was my route too, but so much is different today.\n\nMy first chance as a manager came with Bournemouth in the summer of 1992. At first I was not thinking much beyond my first game - a draw on Preston's plastic pitch by the way - and neither, it seems, was my chairman, Norman Hayward.\n\nI'd been given a club car, which was about 20 years old and, a few months into my first season, we went up to watch Grimsby play one night.\n\nWe drove there in his Mercedes and on the way back he dropped me off where I'd parked up. The windscreen was iced up so I turned on my engine and Norman got out his credit card to try to scrape the ice off.\n\nWhile he was doing that, I heard him shouting: \"Oh no, I can't believe it!\" I thought he had snapped his credit card but he'd actually seen my tax disc. \"They've given you 12 months. I told them six months!\"\n\nI laughed and said: \"Thanks Norman, that gives me loads of confidence!\"\n\nStill, I was fortunate to get the chance at Bournemouth, and also lucky in that I received some good advice on how I might stick around.\n\nI always remember the late Alec Stock - another member of the 1,000 club, who had long spells in charge of Leyton Orient, QPR and Fulham as well as with Yeovil, Roma, Luton and Bournemouth - ringing me up one night and explaining why I should work on a three-year plan.\n\nThe first season, he said, was to assess the players, staff, and get to grips with all the other aspects of how the club is run.\n\nThe second season was to reset it, to get it working on and off the pitch and win all the battles to get things my own way for the third season which, according to Alec, was the season that everyone - supporters, directors and yourself - should see progress.\n\nHe also told me any manager would only ever be judged a success by producing a winning team.\n\nDuring my time at Bournemouth, I learned how true that was - never mind how hard you worked or how much you did to protect your club financially, management was all about winning.\n\nAt the end of my second season, a new chairman took over the club and I was on my way. So much for the three-year plan, but it was still a great two years of learning for me.\n\nNorman was a hard chairman, but he was honest and we remain friends today. I was left more determined than ever to get back in the saddle and go again.\n\nI was 34 when I got the Bournemouth job, which is very young for a manager but I learned the defining reason behind a long life in this new role - as Alec said, management is all about winning.\n\nIrrespective of everything which surrounds the role - which has dramatically changed from my early days, by the way - if you don't win, then forget your philosophies because you won't be in a job for long.\n\nLearning to win with different clubs and different players is a challenge but it was one I enjoyed.\n\nCertain principles must be applied wherever you are and although your team's strengths can and do vary, those principles must stay rock solid.\n\nMost young coaches today move on from academy football into professional football. Academy football is a teaching job, professional football is a winning job.\n\nYou only learn that when you get a professional job - but spaces are scarce for British managers in the Premier League, and they are dwindling in the Championship too.\n\nOf the 44 clubs in England's top two divisions, there are only 21 British managers - 20 in permanent roles, plus Michael Carrick at Manchester United until the end of the season. That's the case even though our football associations deliver state-of-the-art coaching courses which are recognised as being as good, if not better, than in any other country worldwide.\n\nWhat's changed for British managers trying to get a job - or stay in one - is the rise of sporting directors, who have been appointed by mostly foreign owners.\n\nAs I've mentioned before in this column, both the Premier League and Championship also have enormous numbers of players from abroad and clubs know buying players from South America, Africa and Asia can be better value than the market at home.\n\nSo you have foreign owners and foreign directors of football - or even English directors of football working for foreign owners - who all see the value in appointing foreign coaches who have experience of working abroad, speaking different languages and understanding different cultures.\n\nBecause our top two leagues are so multicultural, the big agencies who have often provided assistance to the owners in buying the clubs and have helped guide their appointments too, have an almost direct line to the club's recruitment policies.\n\nRecruitment is everything - if you can crack that side of things and bring good players to your club, then success will be forthcoming. Bournemouth, Brighton and Brentford have proved that.\n\nMy first season out of work after I'd been sacked by Bournemouth coincided with me being asked by Bruce Rioch to watch games for Bolton, who he was managing at the time.\n\nThat period taught me how important knowledge of players was because, after months spent travelling around the country, I was appointed Gillingham manager in 1995.\n\nThe knowledge I'd gained enabled me to bring in players that brought the club one of the most successful periods in its history.\n\nNow, though, that side of things is taken care of by others. Managers are now more seen as coaches, expected to work with players recruited by the director of football, and sometimes without having any say in signings at all.\n\nAs I've mentioned above, there are certain teams whose recruitment has been fantastic, but there are also clubs who have experienced the complete opposite.\n\nAs a manager today, with players arriving from far-flung countries, it is impossible to watch all players live, yet I still would want and expect my club to have the decency to let me view the players they were advising we should sign.\n\nOver the past few months, we've seen young coaches arrive from Europe and the United States to take charge of Southampton, West Brom and Celtic.\n\nWill Still, Eric Ramsay and Wilfried Nancy were all sacked pretty quickly. All three had no experience of British football - yet they were left alone to manage in difficult circumstances. It makes me wonder: Who at each club made that decision?\n\nA lot of directors of football have never experienced management, and until you have actually sat in that hot-seat yourself, you don't realise how difficult it is, or the pressure you put yourself under to succeed.\n\nSomeone with any knowledge of the game, who had done the job themselves, would have provided those young managers with an experienced football man to help them through the initial period at their new club. So why didn't it happen?\n\nMartin, who had been in interim charge at Celtic before Nancy was appointed, is a great example of someone who could have helped.\n\nThere should have been a recognition by the director of football that while Nancy came in with a really strong record in Major League Soccer, that competition is very different to British football.\n\nThere couldn't have been a better fit of someone to help him settle in than Martin, who was already there. He's got the manager's job there again now, of course, but why wasn't he kept on anyway as a mentor when Nancy arrived?\n\nYoung coaches are often appointed on the proviso that their role is to prepare the team to win games. Recruitment is dealt with by other staff, as are the medical and sports science elements, which will determine the availability of your best players through a long hard season.\n\nSo much of the machinery which provides either a successful or unsuccessful season could be dictated by everyone apart from the coach. Yet if the team are unsuccessful, he will invariably take responsibility and get sacked.\n\nIn most of my career, I took full responsibility for all of the above and accepted the end product of the sack if it didn't work.\n\nWith such a small window given to managers and coaches to succeed today, it is not surprising that Steve Cooper turned down opportunities to manage again in the Championship after leaving Leicester and chose to go to Brondby in Denmark instead.\n\nHe believes more patience and time will be provided there for him to be successful, which is something you just don't get in England any more.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

Celtic will visit Ibrox again the following Sunday in the Scottish Cup.\n\nTwo points separate Rangers in second and Celtic, but Celtic have a game in hand against Aberdeen on Wednesday.\n\n\"I see my team is ready to take points and then we will see on Sunday,\" said Rohl, who oversaw a 3-1 January win at Celtic Park.\n\nListen on BBC Sounds, 92-95FM & online, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app, highlights on BBC Scotland from 19:15\n\n\"It makes no sense to speak too much about the other side. They are behind us. We have to focus on ourselves. We want to win this game.\n\n\"Hopefully, both teams try everything and I am confident that we have a big chance to win this game.\n\n\"We are ready. Do it with a hot heart and a smart mind.\n\n\"If we do this then we have a big chance, we have a clear idea of what we want to do.\n\n\"We have also some different solutions, how we can hurt them. But let's see.\"\n\nWhile seven league defeats have curtailed Celtic's defence of the title, 11 draws have left Rangers frustrated in their pursuit of Hearts.\n\nThe most recent was a 2-2 draw from two down at Livingston last week while Celtic lost at home to Hibernian. The weekend before, Rangers recovered from 1-0 and 2-1 down to defeat Hearts 4-2 at Ibrox.\n\n\"My team showed character, big personality in the last couple of weeks,\" Rohl added.\n\n\"Also to come back away in Celtic, in the stadium there after 1-0 down, showed that even if the game goes in one direction, what we don't want, we always have a chance to come back.\n\n\"Yeah, we dropped two points [at Livingston]. We missed two points. But let's turn it in a positive way. At the end, we won one point after 2-0 down.\n\n\"When you are a manager and you have the chance to play at home this kind of game, then you are also on fire. We are on fire. It was a good training week so far.\n\n\"I feel the confidence, I feel the belief. It's not just about the shape and the tactic, but it's also about how we go in duels, how we win the balls, how we play forward.\"\n\nThe German said: \"It's a crucial game, but no team will be out after this game because there are still 27 points you can take. It's two matchdays and you are in the title race again.\n\n\"It's a crucial one because when you come closer and closer to the end of the season and there is more and more in, then you know every game is important.\"\n\nMcCowan backs Celtic as Askou addresses speculation - gossip\n\nFerguson 'confident' of Rangers Old Firm derby win\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views",

    "title": "Hearts failure to Estoril excitement - the 'most Portuguese Scot there is'",
    "description": "After a forgettable seven months in charge at Hearts in 2017, Scottish manager Ian Cathro is rebuilding his reputation at Estoril.",
    "fullText": "Estoril had just lost 3-1 to Sporting at Alvalade, but Ian Cathro was in an incredibly positive mood in his post-match news conference.\n\n\"Can I put a question to you?\" he asked a journalist in native-level Portuguese the last time the team from the Lisbon coast faced Sporting away, in March 2025.\n\n\"What type of football do you like to watch? Did you enjoy the game? Probably you were all around here in other matches and I assume you fell asleep [at some point]. We want to do things differently.\"\n\nThat night, despite the result, at times Estoril, who play in a 5,000-capacity stadium, managed to silence more than 35,000 home fans.\n\nCathro couldn't have been prouder to witness it.\n\nOn Friday, the 39-year-old Scottish coach will be heading back to Alvalade hoping to achieve the same, albeit with a better outcome on the pitch.\n\nHis Estoril side are one of the most exciting teams to watch in Portugal, averaging two goals per game with 46 in 23 matches, the fourth most, and more than league leaders FC Porto (44).\n\nAlong with Sporting, they've had the most games scoring four or more this campaign (six). For the second consecutive season, a team used to fighting relegation finds itself comfortably in the top half of the table, albeit having conceded 39 goals.\n\nThe club's record top-flight points tally of 54, achieved in the 2013-14 season, when they recorded their best finish of fourth, is perhaps out of reach this term given they are on 33 with 11 games remaining, but even Benfica boss Jose Mourinho admitted being impressed by Cathro, saying \"he's leaving his mark\".\n\nThe Scotsman's secret? As he always emphasises, they play with no fear, regardless of the opponent.\n\n\"I'm young, but I've already been through a lot, in a lot of places. I think I've already seen almost every film you can see in a career in this industry,\" Cathro tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"I'm not here trying to win five games in a row just to make the jump. I look at this project and I genuinely feel my responsibility is to help the club take a step to another level. And that other level is more stability, so that no one - absolutely no-one - is afraid anymore.\"\n\nThe recognition for that is certainly coming.\n\nIn January, Cathro was voted the Portuguese top flight's coach of the month by his peers.\n\nThe Dundee-born manager has had previous experience in Portugal, as an assistant to Nuno Espirito Santo at Rio Ave from 2012 to 2014. Cathro then followed Nuno to Wolves, Tottenham Hotspur, Valencia and Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad.\n\nBut he has now found a home away from home in Estoril and has changed the mentality of the club.\n\nSuch is Cathro's impact that, in an unusual move last summer, the club extended his contract until 2028, following his appointment in July 2024.\n\nIf he fulfils it, he will become their second longest-serving coach, behind only former Portugal manager Fernando Santos.\n\nCathro feels he has done enough to change perceptions around him back home to no longer be referred to as the \"ex-Hearts coach\" - he was dismissed after seven months following a shock Scottish League Cup group-stage exit in 2017 in his only other managerial post.\n\n\"I know there will be far less visibility for everything I do here compared with a club in Scotland, if we're talking about the United Kingdom,\" says Cathro, who was also an assistant manager to Steve McClaren and then Rafael Benitez at Newcastle.\n\n\"But knowing that everything we do in life matters and is relevant, it's true that I spent seven months as Hearts' head coach and what happened, happened. If we're going to go into the details of that, we'd need another two or three hours, and it's not really worth it.\n\n\"But any doubts that might have existed after that short spell, if someone looks at everything that's been done and what's being built here, I think those seven months are already in the past.\n\n\"And I look at this job at Estoril as my first one. Because here I've had normal working conditions, and that's why I refer to Estoril as my first team. I want to be a positive figure in the club's history, someone who helped. I'm not here to perform miracles, but to bring more stability.\"\n\nCathro doesn't hold back when speaking and that's something that has made his Estoril news conferences a must-watch.\n\nHe has not always been like this in the past and it's something he regrets.\n\nSo whenever he sees something wrong nowadays, he brings it up - whether it's the league calendar, the local time-wasting culture or the ball-boy system.\n\n\"I don't have any problem saying what I feel, knowing that sometimes I'll say the right thing, sometimes I'll say the wrong thing. I'm not going to hide from something I think is important,\" he explains.\n\nThat straightforward approach is very Portuguese.\n\nIt's no coincidence to find references to him in the local media of being \"the most Portuguese Scot there is\", \"a Scot who could have been born in Estoril\" and \"a Portuguese soul\".\n\n\"This is something that makes me very proud. I've said several times that my life changed completely when I went to Rio Ave,\" says Cathro.\n\n\"I learned - and I became a man - in that Portuguese context. I'm absolutely certain that, in footballing terms, I feel a thousand times more Portuguese than Scottish.\n\n\"What I like most is the fact that time moves a little more slowly here. I live at a completely different rhythm here with my family than I did in Scotland, for example. We're able to make more memories and more meaningful moments as a family.\"\n\nEstoril sporting director Helena Costa recently told Record that she believes Cathro \"will make the step to a big club\".\n\nFor now, though, he prefers to live in the moment.\n\n\"I think I've got far more experience than I've got years of life. And because of that, I don't waste much time on anything that isn't exactly what I have to do today,\" adds Cathro.\n\n\"I know tomorrow isn't 100% under my control, and I don't want to live in the past or in the future either. I've got a big responsibility to help the players and help the club, and I'm not going to do anything that could complicate that.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "USA men's ice hockey player Brady Tkachuk has distanced himself from an AI-enhanced White House video in which he appears to disparage Canadians, saying \"those words would never come out of my mouth\".\n\nThe video was published on the official White House TikTok account after the US beat Canada on Sunday to win gold at the Winter Olympics and is marked as using artificial intelligence.\n\nIt features a modified clip of Tkachuk speaking at a news conference for last year's 4 Nations Face-Off, during which Canadians booed the US national anthem.\n\nTkachuk appears to say: \"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple-syrup-eating [expletive] a lesson. Canada, we own you little bro.\"\n\nTkachuk is captain of the Ottawa Senators and after playing in the Canadian team's first NHL game since the Olympics, he said: \"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving.\n\n\"I'm not in control of any of those accounts,\" he added. \"I know that those words would never come out of my mouth, so I can't do anything about it.\n\n\"It's not what I was saying. I would never say that. It's not who I am. So I guess I don't like that video.\"\n\nSeveral of Tkachuk's team-mates have also apologised for laughing during a congratulatory call from Donald Trump, when the US president said he \"probably would be impeached\" if he did not invite the gold-winning women's team as well as the men to his State of the Union address .\n\nWhile the women's captain Hilary Knight said Trump's joke was \"distasteful\", she added that \"the guys were in a tough spot\" and there was a \"genuine level of support and respect\" between the two US teams.\n\nTkachuk's brother Matthew Tkachuk, who plays for the Florida Panthers, said the teams were \"so close\" at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\n\"We watched other events together, we went and supported,\" he said. \"We love the women's team and the women's team loved us, and we're so proud that we had a clean sweep of gold medals.\"\n\nUS team-mate Jake Sanderson said the laughter had been \"a bit of a mistake\" that \"got blown out of proportion a little bit\", while reserve goaltender Jeremy Swayman said \"we should've reacted differently\" and Charlie McAvoy added it was \"not reflective of how we feel\".",

He's got to be fully focused on straight ahead and the next game, and trying to be as good as he can be.\"\n\nGordon, Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are just some of the Newcastle players who have been touted with moves away in the media in recent months.\n\nBut Howe said it comes with the territory.\n\n\"It's your industry that is creating those stories,\" he added. \"I'm slightly secluded from it.\n\n\"If you don't read it you don't know who has been linked to who. Is it not just part of modern day football that everyone is just linked with moves these days, not just Newcastle players, but potentially a lot of other clubs have the same issues.\n\n\"It's irrelevant really. It's how the players react to that. If they absorb it and it affects them, then that's a negative.

    "description": "Instead of asking what has gone wrong for England in the Six Nations, the question is more why has it gone wrong?",
    "fullText": "What has gone wrong for England this Six Nations?\n\nIt is the obvious question to ask after two chastening defeats which have ended any prospect of a first title since 2020.\n\nHowever, every England fan can see what has gone wrong for Steve Borthwick's side: they are not scoring enough points and are conceding far too many.\n\nThe aerial game is not working and players who were so composed and accurate during a 12-match winning streak are making consistent and uncharacteristic errors – whether in terms of decision-making, discipline or execution of skills.\n\nSo instead of asking what has gone wrong, the question is more why has it gone wrong? And how will England put it right against Italy and France over the next two rounds?\n\nSitting in unseasonably warm February sunshine at the team's Bagshot training base, head coach Steve Borthwick was in a relaxed but defiant mood as he tried to provide some answers - and some solutions - to England's alarming slide.\n\nThe England boss has highlighted three areas where his team were exposed by Ireland in the record 42-21 loss in London - profligacy in the opposition 22, the gifting of turnover ball to the Irish, and, perhaps most glaringly, a lack of physical intensity.\n\n\"We had plenty of chances to score in the first 20 minutes. And if you don't take your chances in Test match rugby it can be very cruel,\" Borthwick explained.\n\n\"Secondly, we turned over too many balls, creating unstructured opportunities for Ireland to attack from, which makes it very, very hard to defend. So we put ourselves in a vulnerable position.\n\n\"And thirdly, and probably most importantly, the intensity that has become a trademark of the team - it wasn't at the level we have set for ourselves.\"\n\nFor Borthwick, the three are inter-linked. A failure to exert scoreboard pressure led to a snowball effect and a game that was quickly out of reach. Physically, England were slow in terms of both thought and deed.\n\n\"We failed to take those opportunities and the opposition take their opportunities and suddenly there is scoreboard pressure against you,\" he added.\n\n\"That is clearly an area of development for us.\"\n\nBut how do you fix this? There had been an expectation that England would be smarting after the Calcutta Cup defeat, and would put it right against Ireland. Instead, the opposite happened.\n\nBorthwick has pledged to raise the bar in training to prepare the group for the showdown in Rome, with a focus on sharpening their attacking edge in opposition territory.\n\n\"We have discussed all aspects of the preparation with the players. We need to drive even further what we are doing in training, and how hard we train. I think we can go further [in training],\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be much more clinical and there are multiple factors involved [when it comes to finishing chances]. There is a mixture of the physicality needed in the collision area, with the composure you need to make those key decisions at the right time.\n\n\"We will be making sure we put the players in those positions as often as possible to ensure we get improvement.\"\n\nHas complacency been an issue? Are England in the right place mentally?\n\nFormer England boss Eddie Jones has suggested that Borthwick's public pre-tournament ambition to compete for the title in Paris on the final day contributed to a lack of focus in the group, a claim the current head coach rejects.\n\n\"I discussed that you only get to that point [a title decider] by taking it one step at a time,\" Borthwick insisted.\n\n\"Our focus has been very much on one game at a time.\"\n\nHowever, Borthwick says he is open-minded as he plots his selection to face the Azzurri.\n\nThere will need to be a change at scrum-half with Alex Mitchell ruled out, while centre Ollie Lawrence is missing training this week with a knee problem.\n\nElsewhere, George Furbank has returned to Northampton and will play in the Premiership Rugby Cup this weekend, and could provide a creative outlet from full-back if he proves his fitness with the Saints. Furbank's presence should help with England's blunt attack.\n\nBut few players who started the games in Edinburgh and at Twickenham have made a compelling case to keep their places. While always reluctant to make sweeping changes, Borthwick has not ruled out wielding the axe.\n\nEveryone in the squad will now be under the microscope, whether in England training or beyond.\n\n\"In some positions the squad is fiercely competitive,\" he said. \"I have got some tough decisions to make there.\n\n\"I will be watching the players, watching how they train, watching how they perform, watching the players who are returning to their clubs this weekend to get game time and watching how they play.\"\n\nBorthwick has sought inspiration from the World Cup-winning crop of 2003 in a fallow week, with nine of that all-conquering group spending Wednesday evening in camp in a meeting arranged in advance of the Six Nations.\n\n\"The players from the 2003 squad performed under incredible pressure, but had numerous setbacks and numerous tough losses,\" he said.\n\nNow the pressure is ratcheting up on the class of 2026. England have never lost to Italy in the Championship's 26-year history.\n\n\"There is always expectation on the England team. Always,\" Borthwick said.\n\n\"Our expectation on ourselves is really high and I don't think our performance levels have come to what we expect of ourselves over the last two weeks.\n\n\"Did we want these two losses? Absolutely not. Did we want the performances to be better? Yes, absolutely. I feel that disappointment and frustration more than anybody else. I am deeply passionate about this team.\n\n\"What we will do is make sure we move forward from this point and we will make sure we put in a level of performance that steps up next week.\"\n\nIn a further comment on his Rugby Unity podcast, Jones mused that the atmosphere at the final whistle at the Allianz Stadium after the Ireland defeat reminded him of the fraught end to his seven-year tenure in 2022.\n\nSo is Borthwick's job under threat? At the moment, no. It is too early for talk of that. It is just two games, albeit bad ones, following an impressive 12-match winning streak.\n\nBorthwick is deep in planning for the 2027 World Cup and the RFU is firmly behind that project.\n\nHowever, not only has no England side ever lost in Rome, but never before have England ended a Six Nations campaign with a single win. Two more defeats would lead to some very serious conversations in the corridors of Twickenham.\n\nAfter the Calcutta Cup victory at Murrayfield, Scotland captain Sione Tuipulotu spoke to the BBC with searing honesty. He said the team owed under-pressure boss Gregor Townsend a performance to quieten the noise around his future. According to Tuipulotu, they did it for Townsend.\n\nThe next two weeks would be a good time for the England players to do similar for their head coach.\n\nFive reasons for England's Six Nations slide\n\nFive talking points from round three of Six Nations",

    "description": "Cadillac and Audi enter F1 with the ultimate goal of becoming world champions. Both know they have some way to go before achieving that aim.",
    "fullText": "There are two new Formula 1 teams in 2026, representing two of the world's biggest car companies. They have the same ambition, but they are two very different projects.\n\nAudi has taken over the Sauber team to form the basis for its works assault on F1, marking parent company the Volkswagen Group's first foray into the highest level of the sport.\n\nUS giant General Motors (GM) is also trying out F1 for the first time. It has joined forces with US sports conglomerate TWG to form a new team named after its luxury Cadillac brand.\n\nBoth were tempted in by the engine rules introduced this year, believing the increased effect of the hybrid part of the engine was an important marketing point for their road-car portfolios.\n\nBoth want to become world champions. Both realise they have some way to go before achieving that aim.\n\nAudi has set themselves a target of being in a position to compete for that in five years' time. Cadillac have been less precise, but team principal Graeme Lowdon has made it clear they have \"limitless ambitions\".\n\nLet's take a look at where the two projects are at.\n\nAudi team principal Jonathan Wheatley, who joined from his former position of sporting director at Red Bull last March, said at the team's launch this year: \"We're not here to mess around. It's an ambitious project. We're humble. We know where we're starting from and we know where we want to go.\n\n\"We want to make Audi the most successful F1 team in history. There are milestones on that journey and we are starting it today.\"\n\nAudi won the Le Mans 24 Hours 13 times in 18 years from 1999 to 2016. And in rallying they were famous for introducing four-wheel drive with the iconic Quattro in the early 1980s.\n\nThey might not have taken part in F1 before, but they did compete in its forerunner, the European grand prix championship, in the 1930s.\n\nIn a battle with arch-rivals Mercedes, Auto Union won the title with the great Bernd Rosemeyer in 1936, won five races against Mercedes' seven in 1937, while the legendary Tazio Nuvolari won races for them in 1938 and 1939 before the Second World War brought racing to a halt.\n\nAudi's entry this year rekindles that old rivalry with Mercedes, and battle lines have already been drawn in a pre-season row over the rules governing the engines' compression ratio. Audi are said to have been prime among those pushing for a rule change because of a fear Mercedes had found a way of exploiting a loophole to their advantage.\n\nRivals on track with Mercedes, though, Audi are unlikely to be for a while.\n\nWhile Mercedes start the season as championship favourites, Audi have a lot of work to do to transform Sauber into a winning proposition.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Audi's entry in August 2022, the first steps of the programme did not augur well. Audi did not invest anywhere near enough money anywhere near soon enough.\n\nSauber made no progress through 2023 and into the following year. With the clock ticking on its entry in 2026, Audi axed chief executive officer Andreas Seidl, who had left his previous role as team principal of McLaren to join them, in mid-2024.\n\nHe was replaced with a dual management team of former Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto, who was tasked with running the factories - Hinwil in Switzerland for Sauber, and Neuberg in Germany for the engine programme - and Wheatley, in charge at the track.\n\nEven then, the management changes were not finished. Binotto had initially joined as chief operating and technical officer. Less than a year later, he was made head of the Audi F1 project, and chief executive officer Adam Baker left the company.\n\nThe appointment of Binotto and Wheatley had a relatively quick impact, as Sauber finally began to move forward in 2025.\n\nHaving been marooned at the back, Sauber became more respectable performers, and their veteran German driver Nico Hulkenberg even finally scored a podium after 16 years of trying in last year's British Grand Prix.\n\nThis year, the driver line-up of Hulkenberg and Brazilian Gabriel Bortoleto, who is heading into his second season, continues, and the new Audi engine makes its debut.\n\nSo far the team have made a promising start.\n\nThey ran their car early in January, the first team to do so built to this year's new rules, and put a first aerodynamic upgrade on it in the final pre-season test in Bahrain last week.\n\nPace-wise, the belief is that Audi are in the midfield mix with Haas, Alpine and Racing Bulls, and ahead of Williams. A solid effort so far, although Hulkenberg is not getting carried away.\n\n\"It's just speculation right now still,\" the German said last week. \"We really don't know until Melbourne and even a few races in, because I feel at the moment it can be quite track dependent on how your package feels on different circuits.\n\n\"So we'll have to wait and see until everybody really pulls their pants down in qualifying and we'll find out. Early days. I hope we're competitive somewhere in the midfield right now.\n\n\"But, yeah, the team's been working hard over the winter, pushing all the areas, doing the power-unit side for the first time. It's been busy and a challenge, and I think we're OK. But there's still a lot of work and a lot of room for improvement on that side and a lot to come.\"\n\nIf Audi was faced with a huge task in taking over a team that had suffered years of underinvestment and trying to make it competitive, while also setting up an F1 engine division, Cadillac's task was just as hard, but in a different way.\n\nThey had to set up a team from scratch, while battling political headwinds for at least three years.\n\nTheir journey started with the US-based Andretti team, which competes in a number of series, including IndyCar and Formula E, pondering an entry in the early years of this decade. But things got messy.\n\nMichael Andretti, who ran the team, rubbed a lot of people in F1 up the wrong way with what was perceived as his abrasiveness and presumption, and there were questions marks within F1 as to how serious GM's involvement was. Initially, the team had a deal to use Renault engines, and it appeared Cadillac was little more than a sponsorship deal.\n\nAndretti put forward its case for an entry through an official FIA process, but despite being accepted by the governing body in October 2023, they were rejected by F1 in January 2024, on the basis that they did not bring extra value to the sport.\n\nBut Andretti parent group TWG refused to accept defeat. They reconfigured their bid. Michael Andretti was removed from the project, although father Mario, the 1978 F1 world champion, remains as an ambassador, and Cadillac's involvement was made more prominent, including taking on the name of the team.\n\nGM pledged to build its own engine - currently scheduled to appear in 2029 - and as it became clearer that Renault might pull out of F1, as it now has, a Ferrari customer deal was inked.\n\nA US department of justice investigation into F1's rejection of Andretti further greased the wheels, and the entry was finally confirmed in March last year.\n\nWhile all this was going on, Lowdon, formerly a senior figure at the Virgin/Manor/Marussia team that raced from 2009-16, was charged with setting up a new company from scratch. They had to commit to that long before the entry was confirmed, or they would simply have run out of time.\n\nChief technical officer Nick Chester, technical director of Renault F1 from 2013-20 and subsequently the title-winning Mercedes Formula E team, was the second person to sign after Lowdon. He started in March 2023, and set to work on building up a 600-strong team at the same time as beginning to design a car.\n\nNow, Cadillac are occupying six buildings on the business park opposite the main entrance of Silverstone, and have two other bases, the GM technical centre in Warren, Michigan, and the GM Motorsport headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, where drivers Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Pérez have been working on the simulator.\n\nA new TWG headquarters in Fishers, Indiana, is due to be finished late this year, and will eventually become the F1 team's manufacturing centre, but the UK base at Silverstone will remain, albeit slimmed down to fewer buildings.\n\n\"You do need really good communications,\" says Lowdon, \"and we've got a massive necessity for peer-to-peer interaction. So we need engineers talking to engineers. We need an engineer here (at Silverstone) talking to an engineer in Charlotte and another one in Warren, Michigan, or eventually in Fishers.\n\n\"So we've looked to have a very, very flat management structure. It's highly modelled on the Apollo project. It's very similar. OK, we're not putting a man on the moon, but it feels like it sometimes.\"\n\nLowdon and Cadillac F1 chief executive officer Dan Towriss, who has the same position at TWG, have been keen to emphasise the size of the task at hand, and their own sense of realism.\n\n\"We started with big dreams,\" Towriss says. \"We ran into a lot of obstacles and it was just a cacophony of voices that were telling us no. Not just no, but never.\n\n\"We've come at this incredibly complex, competitive time and we're jumping in from a standing start.\n\n\"We didn't buy an existing team. We didn't import a bunch of stuff. We started with nothing. So that's a pretty daunting challenge from that standpoint, which is why you heard a lot of people say it's going to be really hard.\n\n\"We know it's going to be really hard, but that's where that grit, that fight, that persistence comes.\"\n\nCadillac have made no bones about the fact that they expect to finish last this year.\n\n\"Can you imagine if you've owned a Formula 1 team for 10 years and then another team rocks up and beats you?\" Lowdon says. \"You would be apoplectic. You would be so annoyed. And so you have to assume that any new team coming in is going to be last, you know, otherwise, you know, what's gone wrong somewhere else?\"\n\nThey do indeed appear to be at the back. But Lowdon's words have been prescient. Aston Martin are in such dire straits that there is a significant question mark about which of the two will be slowest in Melbourne.\n\nThe difference is, if it's Aston Martin, that is a desperate blow. If it's Cadillac, well, it's kind of part of the plan.\n\n\"We're up against teams who have been doing this for a very, very long time,\" Lowdon says. \"We're working through the programme. We've had no major issues, just small issues that I think every team in the paddock will have had before.\n\n\"We've got a lot of experienced people in the team. But the experience of working together as kind of like a Formula 1 team is less than 12 months.\n\n\"But I would say, to sum it up, extremely happy with the team. Very, very happy with the platform that we're building. And we can't wait for Melbourne.\"\n\nThe 'rare combination' behind Britain's youngest F1 driver\n\nWhy has it gone so wrong for Aston Martin?\n\nWill drivers still make a difference in F1 in 2026?\n\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

    "fullText": "The U.S. economy remains the envy of the world in many respects, at least in President Donald Trump’s telling. But its lofty position is threatened by, among other things, America’s own chronic inability to keep a balanced budget, and the administration’s trade policy is part of what’s holding it back from doing so.\n\nWhat challenges does America's budget deficit pose?\n\nWhat solutions does the IMF recommend for fiscal balance?\n\nHow are Trump's tariffs affecting economic growth?\n\nWhy is timing crucial for addressing fiscal imbalances?\n\nIn his State of the Union address this week, Trump said the U.S. was “winning again, and in fact, we’re winning so much that we really don’t know what to do about it.” Despite suffering from low approval ratings, Trump might soon score points for the economy, courtesy of the International Monetary Fund, which this week highlighted how the U.S. remains in many ways an economic powerhouse.\n\nStrong economic growth, rising productivity, and a labor market that has proved adaptable and resilient combine to paint a rosy picture of the U.S. economy, according to Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director.\n\n“We expect that a buoyant U.S. economy will continue to grow strongly throughout this and next year,” Georgieva said on Wednesday, shortly after her agency had released its annual review and outlook for the U.S. economy.\n\nGeorgieva lauded the “remarkable performance” of the U.S. private sector over the past year. GDP growth reached 2.2% in 2025, and the IMF projects it to accelerate to 2.4% for this year. This resilience has turned the U.S. into a primary economic driver for the world that is creating “positive spillovers to the global economy” at a time of high international uncertainty, she added.\n\nA strong economy could be the country’s best chance to patch up its growing deficit, Georgieva said. But at least according to the IMF’s recommendations, Trump’s love for punitive tariffs as a main driving force in his trade policy might be actively working against reaching a balanced budget.\n\nThe deteriorating state of the country’s fiscal balance threatens to extinguish the benefits of America’s strong economy. Under current policies, general government debt—the measure of how much more the country is spending than taking in—could hit 140% of GDP in the next five years, according to the IMF, possibly more than $50 trillion. The agency noted a troubling paradox in recent policy shifts. While tax and spending changes legislated mostly through the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year are expected to modestly boost economic activity this year and next, they’ll be overshadowed by increased spending and lower tax revenue that continue to push federal debt higher.\n\nTrump has framed his tariffs as a key measure to bring in more revenue and reduce the deficit, but Georgieva implicitly pushed back against that narrative. She called U.S. tariffs a “headwind to even stronger growth” that dragged down productivity. In the story of a strong U.S. economy, “we could have seen more of the good news” without the penalizing effect of tariffs, she said.",

    "description": "Former Purdue football coach Ryan Walters and his wife won a lawsuit against a home builder over a disputed $4.5 million construction project.",
    "fullText": "NOBLESVILLE, IN — Former Purdue University football coach Ryan Walters wasn't known for winning here during his two-year stint on the gridiron, but he won this week in a court of law.\n\nAfter he was hired as head coach in 2023, Ryan and Tara Walters' planned to build a home near Jackson Highway and Tippecanoe County Road 400 West on 5 acres of land they bought in February 2023 for $235,000, according to court documents and property records. The Walterses started working on that construction project with Steve Schrader Homes.\n\nThe Walterses and Schrader had a falling-out over the project, and Schrader did not build the house. He did, however, file a lawsuit in June 2024 to recover money he believed the couple owed him, according to the court ruling on the case signed Tuesday, Feb. 26.\n\nThe Journal & Courier has left voicemails for Schrader requesting a comment. The J&C has also attempted to reach Ryan Walters, who is the current defensive coordinator for the University of Washington.\n\n\"Coach Walters won’t have any comment on this private matter,\" said Jeff Bechthold, assistant athletic director for communications at University of Washington.\n\n\"Ryan (Walters) testified he was shocked by the $4.5 million estimate as Schrader had been adamant that the home would not cost more than $3 million,\" the judge wrote. Early issues were the cost of custom cabinets and the builder's percentage fee, which the Walterses believed were too high.\n\n\"Schrader believes he is entitled to receive the entire amount of his management fee and profit, exceeding $377,000, even though he did not build the home or incur the costs under the contract,\" Hamilton Superior 2 Judge Jonathan M. Brown wrote.\n\nThe court held a two-day bench trial on non-consecutive days in July. Brown published his ruling this week.\n\n\"The Walterses are claiming damages against Schrader for failure to return the $12,133.44 they had tendered to Schrader for pre-construction issues that Schrader had not used,\" Brown wrote.\n\nMore: Interested in a former Purdue football coach's home? Here's what $4.9 million can get you\n\nMore: Former Purdue football coach entangled in lawsuit with builder of West Lafayette home\n\n\"The record demonstrates the breakdown of the relationship between the parties was not a product of defiance, but of two parties moving forward under different understandings,\" Brown wrote in his ruling.\n\nBrown ruled that the contract between Schrader and the Walterses was not valid or enforceable.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the Walterses had expectations based upon statements by Schrader that he could build the home they wanted within a certain price range, but the bid process proved that Schrader could not deliver,\" Brown wrote. Details of the home included a basketball court, a golf simulator and pool.\n\nThe ruling ordered Schrader Homes to return $6,560.79 to the Walterses within 30 days.\n\nThe home was built on the property, but not by Schrader. The house and 5 acres sold Aug. 28, 2025, for $4.2 million, according to county property records.\n\nReach Ron Wilkins at rwilkins@jconline.com.

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — As U.S. forces mass in the Middle East, Iran faces the threat of major strikes by the world’s most powerful military, potentially targeting its leaders, military, nuclear sites and critical infrastructure.\n\nIran has nowhere near the same capabilities, and is even more vulnerable after last year's war launched by Israel and recent anti-government protests. But it could still inflict pain on American forces and allies, and may feel it has to if the Islamic Republic's survival is at stake.\n\nWhile Iran suffered major losses last June, it still has hundreds of missiles capable of hitting Israel, according to Israel’s estimates. Iran boasts a much larger arsenal of shorter-range missiles capable of hitting U.S. bases in Gulf countries and offshore American forces, soon to be joined by a second aircraft carrier.\n\nIran has previously threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for the global oil trade, and claimed to have done so partially during military drills last week.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Iran could sink American warships, and top officials have said a U.S. attack would spark regional war. Iran’s U.N. ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said “all bases, facilities and assets of the hostile force in the region” would be legitimate targets.\n\nIsrael carried out heavy strikes on Iran's longer range missile arsenals — as well as its military leadership and nuclear program — during the 12-day war in June. The U.S. struck Iran's main nuclear sites, and President Donald Trump said at the time that they had been “obliterated.”\n\nBut the extent of the damage — and how much has been rebuilt — is still unknown. Iran continued to strike Israel with missiles and drones until the fighting stopped, at times eluding its vaunted air defenses.\n\nIran's shorter-range missile arsenal was largely untouched, said Danny Citrinowicz, an Iran expert at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies. That could make Iran more inclined to retaliate against tens of thousands of U.S. forces based in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere.\n\n“Iran may be weak. But it still has ways to inflict real pain on the United States — and much more incentive to try than it did before,” Nate Swanson, head of the Atlantic Council’s Iran Strategy Project, wrote in Foreign Affairs. “Iranian officials feel they need to give Trump a bloody nose or they will perpetually be at risk.”\n\nIran launched missiles at a U.S. base in Iraq after the killing of its top general in 2020 and targeted a U.S. base in Qatar near the end of last year's war. Those strikes, which appeared to have been telegraphed in advance, caused damage but no fatalities, as early warning systems and missile defenses swung into action.\n\nIran has also held quiet talks with China about purchasing anti-ship missiles that could significantly boost its ability to strike warships and choke sea routes, officials with knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press.\n\nThe officials, from two countries, spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive talks. They said Iran is negotiating to buy a version of China's YJ-12 sea-skimming missiles. They said the outline of a deal was finalized after last year’s war, though no missiles have been delivered.\n\nLast year's Israeli strikes killed several top generals and nuclear scientists, revealing major vulnerabilities. At one point, Trump said the U.S. knew where Khamenei was hiding, calling him an \" easy target.\"\n\nFresh off the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Trump may consider decapitation strikes aimed at bringing down Iran's decades-old Shiite theocracy, which he recently said “would be the best thing that could happen.”\n\nThe Iranians have had eight months to learn from their mistakes and firm up internal security. Citrinowicz said there are likely contingency plans if Khamenei were to be killed. Rather than naming a single successor, power would probably shift to a small committee until hostilities subsided.\n\nExperts say the death of the 86-year-old Khamenei, who has ruled Iran for over three decades, would not in itself spell the end of the Islamic Republic. Power might eventually pass to a member of his inner circle, as it did in Venezuela, or to Iran's Revolutionary Guard.\n\nAmerican allies are clearly concerned about a regional war, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned of a heavy response to any Iranian attack on Israel.\n\nArab Gulf states have long viewed Iran with concern and leaned on the U.S. for defense, but do not want to be drawn into war. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which host thousands of American troops, have said they would not allow their airspace to be used.\n\nAn Arab Gulf diplomat said regional leaders were talking to Iran and the United States to avert war, warning that it could have severe consequences, including a spike in oil prices. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive, closed-door talks.\n\nIran has its own allies, including Houthi rebels in Yemen, armed groups in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. But its self-described Axis of Resistance suffered major losses in the fighting that rippled across the region after Hamas' October 2023 attack from Gaza.\n\nIran or its proxies could also carry out attacks farther afield. The country has been accused of using criminal gangs and armed groups to plan or carry out attacks around the world, including on dissidents, Israelis and Jewish targets.\n\nAfter initially threatening military action over Iran's killing of protesters, Trump shifted attention to its nuclear program, warning that “bad things” would happen if Iran doesn't agree to a deal. The two sides are set to hold another round of indirect talks in Geneva on Thursday.\n\nIran has always said its nuclear program is peaceful, while the U.S. and others have long suspected that Tehran intends to eventually develop weapons. After Trump scrapped a 2015 nuclear agreement, Iran ramped up its enrichment of uranium, building up a stockpile of near-weapons grade material.\n\nIran's biggest sites were hit by U.S. and Israeli strikes, causing significant damage above ground. But it's unclear whether enriched uranium was spirited away before they were hit or buried underground. Iran says it has been unable to enrich since then, but it has also barred inspections.\n\nIran is still believed to be a long ways from developing a usable nuclear weapon, but radioactive material could pose a risk in the event of widespread strikes.",

    "description": "\"We've seen enough. We've heard enough.\"",
    "fullText": "Tampa International Airport became the first to announce dress code rules in an X (formerly Twitter) post shared on February 26.\n\nThe travel hub revealed it's banning a popular travel outfit, explaining, \"We've seen enough. We've heard enough.\"\n\nWhile airports don't have official fashion rules, many airlines have their own dress codes.\n\nAirports aren’t exactly known as a mecca for seeing stylish jet-set outfits, but Tampa International Airport is aiming to change that with a new PSA aimed at some of its worst fashion offenders. In a new post shared on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, the Florida travel hub announced a new dress code rule banning a popular airport travel staple, telling travelers, “we’ve seen enough. We’ve heard enough.”\n\nIn the February 26 social media post, Tampa Airport revealed their campaign to ban pajamas from the premises—which they shared comes after a previous offensive against Crocs footwear. “After successfully banning Crocs and giving everyone the amazing opportunity to experience the world's first Crocs-free airport, it's time to take on an even larger crisis. Pajamas. At. The. Airport. In the middle of the day,” they wrote in the announcement.\n\nAcknowledging the many travelers who turn to sleepwear to make their flights as comfortable as possible, they quipped, “We know this decision could be disruptive to someone in your life. It's time to have a difficult conversation with them. You can do this. We (and Phoebe) believe in you.” They concluded their message, “The madness stops today. The movement starts now. Help Tampa International Airport become the world's first Crocs-free AND pajama-free airport. DO YOUR PART. SAY NO TO PAJAMAS AT TPA.”\n\nTampa Airport didn’t reveal if or how they’ll be enforcing the new dress code, and judging by the tone of the PSA, it seems like it’s more of a suggestion than an absolute ban. While airports don’t tend to have rules about what travelers can wear, many airlines including United, American, Spirit, Southwest, Delta, and Hawaiian say their passengers must be “properly clothed” in the cabin. This usually prohibits wearing offensive and inappropriate clothing, as well as being barefoot.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley has seen the political ground shift beneath him this past year, the boundaries of his California district upended by the nation’s partisan redistricting war.\n\nBut Kiley has made clear he’s not going away quietly. Or to hear him put it: “I’m not going away at all.”\n\nIt’s the kind of defiance that has defined Kiley’s recent tenure in Washington. Some days, he's blasting Democrats and continuing his longstanding antagonism toward California Gov. Gavin Newsom and political pursuits in his home state, including the effort to build high-speed rail. Other days, he's bucking President Donald Trump on his tariffs and criticizing House Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership.\n\nThe double-barreled approach to reelection comes as the former state legislator tries to navigate his way to a third term in the House after watching his current district split into six pieces, leaving him with few paths to remain in office. He plans to announce a decision on his reelection plans on Monday.\n\nKiley's predicament is an example of how the redistricting war that began in Texas, at Trump's urging, and drew a swift counter response from Democrats in California has left some incumbents scrambling to salvage their political careers.\n\nKiley has said on social media he's narrowed his reelection options to two. One would be to take on fellow Republican Tom McClintock in a primary and possibly again in the fall. California uses a system in which the top two vote-getters in a primary regardless of party move on to the general election. His other option would be to run in a Democratic-leaning district and hope he can prevail despite the midterm headwinds facing Republicans.\n\n“He's in real jeopardy of not coming back to Congress,” Republican strategist Rob Stutzman said. “Having said that, I think he's got a better shot than most would under this circumstance. He's a shrewd politician. He works hard.”\n\nAfter Texas redrew its maps to generate five more districts friendlier to Republicans, California responded in kind. Voters approved new congressional district boundaries that give Democrats a better shot at winning up to five additional seats.\n\nKiley is not the only California Republican facing a tougher road to reelection. Republican Reps. Ken Calvert and Young Kim will face off in a new district. Rep. Darrell Issa is expected to seek a 13th term in his current district, but it now tilts toward Democrats. Rep. David Valadao's district in the Central Valley has become even more Democratic-leaning.\n\nKiley has been outspoken about their plight. He authored a bill to prohibit states from carrying out more than one congressional redistricting after each decennial census. But the bill has languished, with just one co-sponsor. He has taken to the floor to criticize Johnson for not doing more to head off a redistricting war that has spread to Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, among others.\n\n“Why is the leader of this institution simply watching as the institution crumbles?” he said in one floor speech.\n\nJohnson said that Kiley's criticism is “misinformed\" and that he brought in some $13 million to fight California's redistricting effort at the ballot box.\n\n“Last cycle, I practically lived in California,” Johnson said. “I spent so many days campaigning in California, I thought Gavin Newsom was going to send me a tax bill. I'll be out there again because California is equally important to us now as it always has been.”\n\nKiley said on social media that he would be choosing between the reliably-Republican district that McClintock serves and an open Sacramento County-focused district where Democrat Kamala Harris would have won the 2024 presidential election by about 8 percentage points.\n\n“Over the coming weeks leading up to the March 4 filing deadline, I will be talking with constituents and folks throughout the state about the best path forward, and I would love to hear from you,” he wrote. “... Thank you for all of the encouragement in working through a set of a challenges we never expected.\"\n\nHis willingness to butt heads with GOP leadership and Trump could appeal to the independent voters he will need to have success in the Democratic-leaning Sacramento district.\n\nKiley was one of six Republicans who earlier this month voted to rescind tariffs Trump imposed on Canada. Before that, he voted to override two Trump vetoes. He also weighed in with a bill to temporarily extend health care subsidies in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, though he ultimately voted against the clean, three-year extension sought by Democrats.\n\n“He's positioning himself to basically run as a Republican that is independent of the speaker and the leadership, and independent from the White House,” said Stutzman, the Republican strategist.\n\nStutzman added that some of Kiley's actions also stem from a genuine unhappiness with Republican leaders on the redistricting war.\n\n“They started a fight and then left these guys bleeding on the battlefield,\" Stutzman said.\n\nStutzman said the Sacramento-area district is an interesting setup for Kiley because part of his political brand is being a Newsom antagonist, and Newsom hasn't fared as well there as he has overall in the state.\n\n“He's going to put up a good fight in this seat — if that's what he does,” Stutzman said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Paul Mitchell said he doubts the seat is winnable for Republicans in an election likely to be a referendum on Trump.\n\n“It is a more swingy seat than a seat in Santa Monica or San Francisco, but it's not a seat that I think a Republican wins, especially not in a blue wave election,” said Mitchell, a political data expert.\n\nMitchell sees Kiley's best chance of returning to Congress as unseating McClintock, who has served nine terms in the House. And before that, 22 years as a California legislator. He may be the most conservative member of the California delegation.\n\nMcClintock said of a possible Kiley challenge: “Desperate people do desperate things, but it's a free country and he's free to run where he wishes.”\n\nThe Club for Growth Political Action Committee, a powerhouse in GOP primaries that often puts its vast resources behind the most fiscally conservative Republican candidate, endorsed McClintock last week. Trump also gave McClintock his “Complete and Total Endorsement.”\n\nSuch endorsements will be key for McClintock. He came into this year at a distinct financial disadvantage compared with Kiley. Federal Election Commission records show McClintock with less than $100,000 in cash on hand at the end of December; Kiley had more than $2 million.\n\nKiley's campaign put some of those resources to work earlier this month with more than $175,000 spent on a political ad that shows him as a foil to Newsom. “That's why President Trump said no one has fought Gavin Newsom harder than Kevin,” a narrator says.\n\nAd-Impact, which tracks political ad spending, said most of the funds were directed to the Fresno and Visalia media market. Mitchell says the lack of spending in Sacramento could be a sign of Kiley's thinking.\n\n“I should expect to see him at things in this part of the district or Republicans all excited about Kiley in this part of the districts. It's like crickets,\" Mitchell said.\n\nKiley said the ads did not necessarily mean a decision had been made. He said he's talking to current constituents as well as those he might serve in the future, “seeing which is the best fit.”",

    "fullText": "Critics are calling out President Donald Trump and his administration after what appears to have been a massive screw-up in the airspace around El Paso, Texas, for the second time in less than a month.\n\nThe U.S. military on Thursday reportedly used a laser weapon to shoot down a drone near the U.S.-Mexico border. It turned out the drone was operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, The Associated Press reported.\n\nEarlier this month, the FAA shut down the El Paso airport and surrounding airspace after CBP used a laser to shoot down party balloons that it had mistakenly believed to be Mexican drug cartel drones. CBS News reported that the closure was also related to military tests of the laser weapon, as well as a dispute with the FAA over how to handle them.\n\nPolitics: Stephen Miller Had A Wild 8-Hour Crash Out On X, And Only Stopped After Brutal Clapback\n\nIn the latest case, the FAA closed off airspace, but not the airport. The move did not impact commercial flights, AP reported.\n\nCartel drones have been spotted with increased frequency near the border. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that they tend to be “crudely adapted” off-the-shelf models and are used for both surveillance and to drop drug packages.\n\nHowever, critics slammed the Trump administration for deploying experimental weapons without even correctly identifying the target:\n\nThey got Star Wars tech but can't tell friend from foe.

    "description": "Well-known political provocateur appears before state’s House Business Committee in offensive costume to support immigration bill, inviting uproar",
    "fullText": "A far-right agitator caused outrage by testifying before Idaho’s House Business Committee this week wearing an offensive brownface costume.\n\nDavid Pettinger, 49, arrived to discuss a bill concerning unauthorized workers in the state and the prospect of introducing an E-Verify program while wearing brown makeup, sunglasses, a wig, a beard, and handcuffs dangling from his wrist.\n\nSurprisingly, the panel’s acting chair, Republican Rep. Josh Wheeler, allowed Pettinger to deliver his testimony unchallenged, which he duly did, speaking in Spanish.\n\n“El Jefe, amigos,” he said. “No hablo ingles.”\n\nWhen Democratic Rep. Steve Berch questioned Pettinger’s costume, reminding the committee it was not a forum for “performance theater,” Wheeler just smirked and instructed the speaker to deliver “straight testimony,” according to The Idaho Statesman.\n\nWhen Pettinger resumed speaking in Spanish, another GOP representative, Brent Crane, asked for a break, during which the guest was persuaded to pivot to English, which he did, using his platform to attack refugees and immigrants to the United States.\n\nConcluding his remarks, Pettinger said: “I was looking forward to giving you some entertainment and I think that you would have enjoyed that testimony substantially more, but considering that I don’t want to end up in these handcuffs again by your friends from the Idaho State Patrol in the back, we will just leave it at that.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Nikson Mathews, chair of the House’s Queer Caucus, subsequently attempted to use his time to rebuke Pettinger over the stunt, only to be cut off and ordered to resume his seat by Wheeler.\n\n“I have to say what happened today is unacceptable,” Mathews said. “That man should have been removed from this room.”\n\nThe acting chair – who was in place because the committee’s usual chairman, Republican Rep. Jordan Redman, was presenting the bill under discussion – had broad authority to simply bar Pettinger from speaking by invoking House rules on decorum, but chose not to do so, the Statesman pointed out.\n\nPettinger is well-known in Idaho political circles and has a history of “racist, misogynist and morally repugnant performances,” according to the site, including previously dressing as a prom queen wearing a sash bearing the name of a legislator accused of rape.\n\nHe has also appeared as the Joker, a “Little Gay King,” and as Adolf Hitler outside of a Tesla dealership to attack Elon Musk.\n\nPrior to his committee appearance, Pettinger posted a Facebook selfie in which he wore the same brownface costume, topped off with a rainbow sombrero.\n\n“No matter your politics, this is racist and absolutely unacceptable behavior from our elected officials,” the ACLU of Idaho wrote in a statement in response to his latest outrage.\n\n“Our elected officials should be leading public forums with civility and respect, not hate.”\n\nAlso responding was PODER of Idaho, a social justice organization standing up for the state’s Latino and migrant communities, which said on Facebook: “Our legislature is supposed to be a place for serious policy discussion, not racist theatrics. This was hate speech, plain and simple.\n\n“It was a deliberate distraction from the E-Verify bill that many of us showed up to testify on in good faith. Our legislature is supposed to be a place for serious policy discussion – not racist theatrics.\n\n“This was hate speech, plain and simple. It was a deliberate distraction from the E-Verify bill that many of us showed up to testify on in good faith.”",

    "fullText": "Drake Maye’s remarkable 2025 season ended with a thud on the biggest stage, as the Seattle Seahawks overwhelmed the New England Patriots 29–13 in Super Bowl LX. For a quarterback who led the league in completion percentage and QBR during the regular season, the performance was a sharp downturn, two interceptions, constant pressure, and never a true rhythm.\n\nDuring an appearance with Rich Eisen, Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald was asked bluntly about the defensive approach.\n\n“It looked like, you know, you identified a way through and hit the crap out of that… well, you know, all game.”\n\nMacdonald didn’t describe an all-out blitz fest. Instead, he pointed to situational control that began on early downs.\n\n“I think one thing that doesn’t get talked about enough is how we played on early downs, you know, in some of those run or pass type of situations where we’re able to like force and maximize the amount of times that they needed to drop back.”\n\nThat early-down dominance was the foundation. Seattle consistently limited New England’s rushing success, putting Maye in second-and-long and third-and-obvious passing situations. By “maximizing the amount of times that they needed to drop back,” the Seahawks removed balance from the Patriots’ offense and dictated the script.\n\n“It’s tough to do that in the NFL at a certain frequency throughout a game. And the way our guys played on first down to create those opportunities was what our guys asked for because now they can come to life and execute their rush plan and dial up blitzes.”\n\nOnce Seattle forced predictable dropbacks, the pass rush could “come to life.” Edge rushers attacked protection tendencies. Interior defenders collapsed the pocket. Blitzes were dialed up at calculated moments rather than randomly. The result was six sacks in the Super Bowl and relentless disruption that never allowed Maye to settle.\n\nThe irony is that Maye’s regular season was historic. Pro Football Focus ranked him No. 25 overall in its Top 101, noting his 80.7 overall grade, 76.6 passing grade, and dynamic rushing impact. He completed 72 percent of his passes averaged 8.9 yards per attempt, threw 31 touchdowns, and finished runner-up for MVP. He led the franchise past marks once set by Tom Brady and tied Patrick Mahomes for the most 100-plus passer rating games in a season by a quarterback under 24.\n\nBut the postseason told a different story. His completion rate dipped to 58.3 percent. He threw four interceptions in four playoff games. His PFF playoff passing grade plummeted to 35.3. Protection issues played a role — the Patriots surrendered 47 sacks in the regular season and 21 \n\nMacdonald’s defense didn’t just attack Maye. It engineered the circumstances to expose him. By winning on first down, forcing predictable passing situations, and then unleashing a tailored rush plan, the Seahawks turned a breakout superstar into a young quarterback fighting for survival.\n\nThe post Mike Macdonald Explains How Seahawks Defense “Hit the Crap Out of” Drake Maye in Super Bowl LX appeared first on The SportsRush.",

Sometimes they’re decided by the calmest release. On a night when Luka Dončić authored 41 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, it was O’Neale who wrote the final line. His game-winning three over the Lakers didn’t just punctuate a comeback; it exposed a late defensive unraveling by the Lakers and elevated the Phoenix Suns’ evolving identity.\n\nFeb 26, 2026; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles forward LeBron James (23) against the Suns in the first half at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nThursday night was a tug-of-war. The Lakers toggled between drop and blitz schemes, doing just enough to keep Phoenix from finding rhythm. Then the script flipped. Over the final stretch, Phoenix spaced the floor with surgical patience. The Suns generated consistent offence and forced miscommunications in Los Angeles’ weak-side rotations. O’Neale’s winner mattered because it wasn’t improvised chaos. It was a process. Drive, kick, extra pass, feet set. Release.\n\nFor fans in the Valley, it’s a reminder that championship teams need connective tissue players who embrace the biggest shot without demanding it. Nationally, it’s a warning that depth and decision-making can neutralize even a 41-point masterpiece. Superstars shape nights. Structure wins them. In a rivalry already rich with chapters, this one belongs to the guy who didn’t blink, and Royce O’Neale delivered another storied moment between these two NBA franchises.\n\nPhoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers tied at halftime in close matchup",

    "description": "The lads were looking to get the season back on track at Aldershot, after a midweek horror show.",
    "fullText": "It’s easy to look back on Sunderland’s 87-88 season as a positive one all told, and ultimately it was – but it wasn’t all plain sailing.\n\nLast week, I wrote about Sunderland’s 2-0 win over Brentford as Denis Smith’s team looked to cement its place at the top of the Third Division – a victory that came against all of the odds with the vast majority of the first team laid low with the flu.\n\nAfter the game, the players were knackered – but faced two away games against relegation candidates in the next seven days; firstly against Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park, and then against Aldershot at the Recreation Ground.\n\nThese were two games that Sunderland were very much expected to win – however, as we all know, things like that don’t always go to plan.\n\nThe Bristol Rovers game resulted in a heavy 4-0 defeat – the worst loss of the season and the only time Sunderland conceded more than three in a game all season. The game had been ignited early on after a poorly timed tackle from Gordon Armstrong broke the ankle of Rovers player/assistant manager Kenny Hibbitt, ending the former Wolver player’s playing career. Armstrong saw yellow, Rovers were furious, and it made for a high-octane affair that Smith described as ‘Bristol Rovers’ cup final’. It was one in which Sunderland were very much second best.\n\nAnd naturally that did little to ease the growing discontent that Sunderland supporters were feeling.\n\nIn the letters page of the Sports Echo, Clive Lee – a regular contributor to local letters pages at the time – said:\n\nAlthough we have led the Third Division for some time, over the past few months a great deal of complacency has crept into Sunderland’s performances…\n\nThe Bristol Rovers defeat must jolt the players out of the dream of promotion and face realituy that we are nowehre near home and dry. Teams are breathing right down our necks and waiting for slip ups.\n\nThere are a lot of gaps clearly to be seen in midfield which urgently need sorting out. Denis Smith should make up his mind either to give John Cornforth full games or go out and buy a quality midfielder. I would ive the lad his chance at least.\n\nAlso the forward line lacks fire power. A striker must be signed soon if we are to make promotion more positive.\n\nAnother contributor, T Race, echoed the need to get another midfielder in, and said:\n\nThe results of recent games have actually been better than the performances of the team and the time to strengthen the team is now. I was however pleased to read the manager did not sign Johnny Byrne from QPR foer £250,000. Sunderland cannot afford to put all of their eggs in one basket.\n\nIf perhaps Andy Dibble and Imre Varadi were signed, this would improve the forward line and the defence, and not cost the sum mentioned. Another possibility is the signing of Marco Gabbiadini’s younger brother from York. Marco has said he’s bigger and better than him. One Gabbiadini is great – two could be even better.\n\nSmith had been linked with Byrne – who was playing top flight football in London – however wouldn’t pay the £250,000 asking price; preferring instead to target ‘three players’ he wanted to bring into the club.\n\nOn the back page of the Echo on the day the lads played Aldershot was the story of a prospective new signing – Smith wanted to land Fulham’s striker Leroy Rosenior (father of current Chelsea boss Liam).\n\nTwenty three year old Leroy had scored 19 division three goals already this season, and Smith had offered a sizeable fee plus Keith Bertschin in part exchange – however top flight Watford were said to have beaten Sunderland’s offer. The manager was keen to offload Bertschin, who a year after signing for the club hadn’t moved to the north east.\n\nSmith was also fielding accusations that, after the 4-0 reverse in the West Country, the Sunderland players had wrecked the away dressing room.\n\nThese are very serious accusations which I take great exception to.\n\nA suspended ceiling came toppling down and we were very fortunate indeed that only Reuben Agboola received grazes to his body.\n\nI will be discussing the matter with my board of directors next week, when I expect we release an official statement.\n\nOn the field, things didn’t get much better down at Aldershot, with the lads going down 3-2 – the winning goal scored by ex Sunderland player Steve Berry.\n\nClive Lee had got his wish – John Cornforth was given a start in the centre of midfield, replacing the suspended Steve Doyle after his red card at Fulham, while Marco Gabbiadini returned to the team in place of Bertschin.\n\nAnd, Sunderland were twice in the lead as they looked to bounce back from the midweek horror show. First of all, John MacPhail had converted from the spot for the eighth successive time after Gates’ shot had been handled by defender Colin Smith in the 11th minute – and almost immediately, Sunderland should have been two up, when Gabbiadini, through on goal, shot straight at keeper Tony Lange.\n\nSunderland’s fragile confidence showed, though, and on 16 minutes Aldershot were level, Glyn Riley firing into the roof the net from close range after a corner reached him unmarked at the back post.\n\nShortly afterwards, though, the lads were ahead again, Gabbiadini stealing possession as Tommy Langley dithered, and firing into the goal from a tight angle.\n\nThe teams were trading blow for blow, however, and almost immediately Aldershot were level again. Hesford had made an excllent save and captain Gary Bennett made an acrobatic clearance as the rest of the Sunderland defence stood flat footed – however Langley, who’d conceded possession for Gabbiadini’s goal moments earlier – fired towards goal, the linesman flagging the ball had just crossed the line.\n\nLess than 30 minutes gone, and the game was 2-2 – and unsurprisingly both teams had opportunities to score again before the break. Berry flashed a shot wide for the home team, while Gabbiadini went close to a second, and Owers headed wide when it was easier to score.\n\nJust after the bream though, Aldershot took the lead – and it was Steve Berry, who hadn’t enjoyed the best of times at Roker, who scored with a drive from the edge of the box that beat Hesford all the way.\n\nFor the rest of the second half, Sunderland had a lot of possession but failed to make a breakthrough – the final ball often letting the side down. Owers forced a good save from Lange with a well struck shot after a corner was cleared, but the breakthrough wasn’t forthcoming. Whether tiredness played its part after illness and three tough games in seven days, who’s to say. Maybe that was a convenient excuse.\n\nBut Sunderland dropped down to second, and what looked like a certain promotion a couple of months ago seemed an increasingly uncertain proposition.",

    "fullText": "Utah continues to grow its reputation as the state of sport, and the country is finally noticing.\n\nA recent article from The Athletic published this week called Utah “a sports boomtown” with its multiple professional teams and as the future home of a second Winter Olympics in 2034.\n\nWhile the majority of the article explored Utah’s efforts to land an MLB team, Miller Sports + Entertainment president Michelle Smith believes the NWSL’s Utah Royals “fit in right at the top” in the state’s “sports boomtown” reputation, she told the Deseret News Thursday at the team’s kit launch event.\n\nSmith has been a vocal champion for the Royals, even raising her hand in a meeting and saying, “Hey, I really think we need to keep the Royals” when there was an opportunity for another buyer to purchase the team.\n\nSmith saw value in the Royals, especially within the community, as well as the power that came from both the Royals and Real Salt Lake working together to elevate each other, she said.\n\nFor Smith, it’s important for the Utah Royals to use its platform as a women’s professional team to make an impact on the community whether it’s through players building a love of sports in youth or giving back to the community with service projects at every home match.\n\n“I am so excited that Utah gets to be the stewards of women’s professional sports and not just soccer, but softball and volleyball,” she said.\n\nUtah Royals FC first came to Utah when Dell Loy Hansen purchased the club in November 2017 and relocated it from Kansas City ahead of the 2018 season.\n\nIt was the professional home for U.S. women’s national team stars Christen Press, Kelley O’Hara and Becky Sauerbrunn. But over the course of three seasons, the Royals never reached the playoffs.\n\nIn December 2020, Hansen sold the team to an ownership group led by Chris and Angie Long, which moved the club back to Kansas City following the 2020 season.\n\nThe Royals would return to Utah a few years later, but this time as an expansion club bought by Real Salt Lake owner David Blitzer and Utah Jazz owner Ryan Smith as a minority owner.\n\nUnlike the original iteration of the club, the new Royals didn’t inherit any personnel and had to start from scratch.\n\nThe 2024 Utah Royals featured a new sporting director, head coach and an entirely new roster assembled through the NWSL entry draft, free agency and one lone player through the expansion draft: captain Paige Monaghan (the other expansion draftee, Elyse Bennett, was traded days later).\n\nThe Royals struggled on the pitch in their inaugural season, leading to a coaching change midway through the season.\n\nThen-assistant coach Jimmy Coenraets was named interim head coach after the firing of Amy Rodriguez. Coenraets was later named head coach a week and a half before the season finale.\n\nA month into the 2025 season, the Royals and Real Salt Lake underwent an ownership change when the Larry H. Miller Company purchased majority control of the teams with Blitzer staying on as a minority owner.\n\nDefender Kate Del Fava was drafted by the Royals in 2020 and is the only player on the team who has played for both iterations of the club.\n\nOn Thursday, Del Fava said the current Utah Royals “really doesn’t” feel like the same organization she began her career with.\n\n“It feels totally different this time around,” she said. “This time around, it just really feels like it’s one club, it’s one Utah, it’s one community. And it feels like the women’s side is just as invested in as the men’s side and it’s taken just as seriously, and they’re just as proud to have us here representing the state.”\n\nThe support of the team’s current ownership was evident Thursday when Michelle Smith became emotional during her remarks.\n\n“I think any time you have a part of ownership get up and get choked up talking about the team, that really motivates the girls,” Del Fava said.\n\nMonaghan also spoke highly of the Millers at this season’s Royals media day.\n\n“I think when you strive for perfection and you arrive at greatness, that’s a pretty great place to be, so, I think, obviously, they’ve (the Millers) done that in the community. They did that a while ago with Utah Jazz, obviously, the Bees and now us,” she said. “So to be a part of that is what you want in elite sports. So I think it starts in the top and funnels down. So selfishly, I’m so excited that I get to reap that benefit.”\n\nMonaghan pointed to the infrastructure the Royals have built, comparing it to her college days at Butler University.\n\nShe said while she was in college, she liked getting extra individual reps with her coaches, but with only “two coaches, they didn’t have time to do that,” which left Monaghan to do them on her own.\n\nThat’s not the case with the Utah Royals, according to Monaghan.\n\n“Now, we have this infrastructure where I can do everything I can to be the best I can be, and I have the resources to do that,” she said.\n\nMonaghan’s and Del Fava’s sentiments about the Miller ownership group are part of Michelle Smith’s hopes for the club’s future.\n\n“I hope that we create an environment and a culture for these women athletes to feel like they’re valued and they’re seen and they’re respected and they have an incredible career and can look back and say, ‘I couldn’t have played for a better team. ... I couldn’t have played for a better club and a better ownership,’ and that will continue to build into their DNA as they continue to carry on in wherever their journey takes them.”\n\nWhat’s Michelle Smith’s other hope for the Royals to accomplish on the pitch?\n\n“Obviously, my greatest hope is that we can get a title, for sure. There’s nothing more fun than to experience the success on the field, especially at that level,” she said.",

    "fullText": "But if a report from Fussball Daten in Germany is to be believed then the Anfield club are looking further afield for their new midfielder.\n\nEintracht Frankfurt powerhouse Hugo Larsson has emerged as a key target - according to the report. The Sweden international gets through 12.4km of work on average in his Bundesliga games and that kind of work rate is certain to appeal to Reds recruiters.\n\nLarsson signed from Malmo back in 2023 - going on to establish himself as one of the most in-demand midfielders in the German top flight.\n\nPossessing box-to-box capabilities as well as tactical intelligence Larsson can play as a No6 or else further forward.\n\nHis signing is tipped to cause a financial earthquake in German football - says the report - and Arsenal as well as Liverpool are on hand to offer a mammoth contract.\n\n“Arsenal and Liverpool are leading the chase,” the report states. “A historic offer for Larsson is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.”\n\nLarrson is under contract with Frankfurt until 2029 - earning a reported €3m per season - but a Premier League contract could be worth four times that according to the report.\n\nA €12m annual contract equates to roughly £200k per week - figures which would put Larsson among Liverpool’s top earners right from the off.\n\nThe 21-year-old is being valued by his club at between £52m and £56m - with the report suggesting Frankfurt are ready to add to those sums with a variety of clauses.\n\nArsenal have put together a £35m + £9m in bonuses package in an attempt to attract Frankfurt into doing business but it’s certain they will hold out for more.\n\n“Interested parties will likely have to put together a total package of 60 to 65 million euros,” the report states.\n\nFrankfurt have a clear policy of selling their biggest stars for top dollar - as evidenced by the sales of Hugo Ekitike and Omar Marmoush to name two recent examples.\n\nAnd as the summer transfer window approaches there are clear indications that Hugo Larsson will be next.",

    "fullText": "Corinthians are in advanced negotiations to sign former Manchester United and West Ham United attacking midfielder Jesse Lingard, according to reports from ESPN Brasil.\n\nThe 33-year-old has emerged as a prime market opportunity after recently leaving FC Seoul, where he spent the last two seasons.\n\nThe Man Utd academy graduate made 67 appearances in South Korea, scoring 19 goals and providing 10 assists, while also wearing the captain’s armband during his stint in the K League.\n\nSources in Brazil indicate that financial hurdles, which had initially delayed talks, have now been resolved, with Corinthians working to finalise the remaining details in the coming hours.\n\nThe proposed deal is understood to be a one-year contract. The move would mark another intriguing chapter in Lingard’s globetrotting career.\n\nLingard enjoyed his most influential spell at Old Trafford between 2015 and 2020, scoring in domestic cup finals and becoming a regular under multiple managers.\n\nLingard made 232 appearances for the club, scoring 35 times and providing 21 assists.\n\nHe also briefly shared a dressing room with Dutch forward Memphis Depay during the 2015/16 campaign. A reunion could now be on the cards in Sao Paulo.\n\nLingard also had spells at Derby County, Nottingham Forest and notably West Ham, where he rediscovered top form during a loan stint in 2021.\n\nThat period was one of the most memorable of his career.\n\nHe recorded 14 goal contributions in 16 outings for the Hammers and reiterated his value as they surged up the league table.\n\nCapped 32 times by the England national football team and scoring six international goals, Lingard would bring significant pedigree and big-game experience to the Brazilian giants.\n\nHe had also attracted interest from Clube do Remo, but Corinthians now appear firmly in pole position to secure his signature.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea will not be forced into selling their biggest stars this summer despite recording the highest pre-tax loss in English football history, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nFigures published in UEFA’s European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report show the Blues posted a staggering €407 million (£350m) deficit for the 2024/25 season.\n\nThat figure is surpassed only by FC Barcelona’s €555m loss in 2020/21. The numbers have put Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly-owned Chelsea under intense scrutiny once again.\n\nHowever, insiders have stressed that the headline figure does not reflect the club’s underlying financial health.\n\nThey insist the loss stems largely from non-cash accounting adjustments linked to the takeover.\n\nSources maintain that Chelsea are now profitable on an operating basis and remain in line with UEFA regulations under their existing settlement agreement.\n\nCrucially, there is no pressure to cash in on prized assets such as Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez, or Moises Caicedo to comply.\n\nThe Blues have also structured contracts with heavy performance incentives, particularly linked to Champions League qualification, to help soften the blow should European revenues fluctuate.\n\nUEFA’s assessment period covered a campaign in which Chelsea competed in and won the Conference League and secured a top-four league finish to return to Europe’s elite competition.\n\nStill, while the accountants may argue the books are under control, the broader picture is damning.\n\nChelsea’s scattergun recruitment, from Deivid Washington and David Datro Fofana to Mathis Amougou, Lesley Ugochukwu, Omari Kellyman and Joao Felix, has bloated the books.\n\nOf the 12 players they bought ahead of the 2024/25 season, only eight remain on the club’s books, and four are currently on loan.\n\nLavish spending without coherent planning has inflated losses and left a bloated squad.\n\nIn any well-run system, such a reckless strategy would invite far harsher consequences than creative accounting explanations.",

    "description": "Welsh cyclist Zoe Backstedt is preaching the importance of wearing a helmet after a scary training crash.",
    "fullText": "Zoe Backstedt has highlighted the importance of always wearing a helmet after suffering a scary crash in training.\n\nThe Welsh cyclist suffered a broken hand and wrist in October, which saw her cyclo-cross season interrupted.\n\nShe returned to racing at the end of December, before finishing 7th in the women's elite race at the 2026 Cyclo-Cross World Championships in Hulst, Netherlands in January, just three months after her accident.\n\n\"Who knows what would have happened if I hadn't had it on, maybe I wouldn't be here today, the way the helmet broke into so many pieces,\" said 21-year-old Backstedt.\n\n\"When I crashed I didn't even realise what was happening, because click your fingers and it was over.\n\n\"I stood back up and had the immediate aftershock of, 'this isn't good'.\"\n\nThe heavy crash occurred a fortnight before Backstedt was due to start her 2025-26 season.\n\n\"My hand was hurting, got it caught in my front wheel and my head was on the ground,\" the Belgium-based rider told BBC Sport Wales from a training camp in Spain.\n\n\"There were so many emotions going through me. My first thought was, my cyclocross season is done.\n\nThe younger sister of fellow professional Elynor Backstedt, she feared she would not be back on her bike until the prestigious one-day road 'Spring Classics', starting at the end of February.\n\n\"I went to a specialist back in Belgium and she said that it was going to be the new year that I was going to be able to race.\n\n\"I did start crying in that moment, because I'd done so much training, and I'd done so much preparation for the cyclo-cross season.\n\n\"To think that in the space of two seconds, that is gone, you know? That's the season almost done.\"\n\nHer recovery, however, was quicker than hoped.\n\n\"Once I could start training again a little bit and I was cleared from concussion, I started planning when I could get back,\" she added.\n\n\"Then I had a goal to look forward to and I had a race in mind that I could try and be on the start line for.\n\n\"That was the thing that was keeping me going, knowing that at some point I could, even though it was a short season, I could still do some cyclocross races.\"\n\nBackstedt says the experience has left no doubt in her mind about the importance of wearing a helmet.\n\n\"Everywhere I go, I try to wear a helmet, even if it's just two kilometres away, it can save you so much if you're in an unfortunate accident.\"\n\nDespite a reduced cyclo-cross season, Backstedt returned in time to make it to the Worlds at the end of January.\n\nAnd the Welsh rider admits she loves the wintery conditions cyclo-cross provides.\n\n\"The dream conditions are two degrees, raining, just like growing up in Wales,\" Backstedt explained.\n\n\"Everyone is cold on the start line, and then you start, and it's full gas, start to finish.\n\n\"You have some running in there, you have to get off and go up stairs, you have to do everything that cyclo-cross involves.\"\n\nWith a new Worlds course in Hulst, Backstedt admits there was still some trepidation when doing reconnaissance.\n\n\"Nobody had done the course before,\" she said.\n\n\"You get to the first downhill and we know what it's like to run up but we don't know what it's like to go down.\n\n\"You come into it the first time, and you think, 'Oh my gosh, I don't want to look down, because it's really steep,' and you think, 'How am I going to get down here? Which line do I take?'\n\n\"You stand at the top for ten minutes to watch some more people do it, and then you get to the bottom and think, 'what was I so worried about?',\" she added.\n\nBackstedt's seventh place finish was just 14 seconds off a medal, and she was an agonising four seconds off a medal in the mixed relay. An encouraging return for her first senior World Championship.\n\nBackstedt claims gold in U23 time trial at Worlds\n\nBackstedt wins national time trial to claim first elite title\n\nBackstedt becomes youngest winner of Baloise Ladies Tour\n\nThe family name Backstedt carries a lot of weight in cycling circles.\n\nHer father Magnus won Paris-Roubaix and a stage of the 1998 Tour de France, while her mother, Megan, won the British road race national title and competed for Wales at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpa the same year.\n\nBoth Zoe and Elynor followed suit and began to forge their careers in the professional ranks.\n\nBackstedt says she takes a lot of inspiration from her time at Maindy Flyers in Cardiff, a cycling club with some very famous alumni.\n\n\"Elinor Barker was just a few years older than my sister, so as I was looking towards cycling as a career, she was stepping into racing and I got to watch her grow and progress in the sport.\n\n\"It's something cool to see, coming from the same club you are, riding circles around Maindy Velodrome and you're like 'Yeah, if she can do it, I can do it, maybe I can follow in those footsteps'.\n\n\"We've had a similar path into cycling and then you want to do that too.\"\n\nOlympic gold medallist and Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas also began his career at the famous track, first opened in 1951 before hosting the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"He progressed from Maindy to the men's world tour, so it's a little bit different, but you're still coming from the same place, doing the same sessions on a Tuesday night,\" she added.\n\nBackstedt hopes she too can provide inspiration for the next generation coming through the club.\n\n\"To see all the little ones that are coming up through the sport and see if you can inspire them.\n\n\"I think even out on the roads here in Spain, I've seen some people from Maindy out riding.\n\n\"You're waving at them on the bike and you're like, 'Yeah, you could be in my team in a few years, or riding in one of the men's teams', and that's just so cool to see.\"\n\nBackstedt has lofty ambitions for her career, having already won nine world titles by the age of 20 across cyclo-cross, road and track cycling.\n\nBut there is no doubt about what the Welsh rider would like to have achieved before her career is all said and done.\n\n\"I think I have to go with the obvious dream of Olympic champion, that's one in the future that would be a very big goal of mine,\" said Backstedt.\n\n\"I want to go for Los Angeles 2028, I want to give my everything to be on the start line and go for a podium, that would be pretty cool to do.\n\n\"If I hadn't been sick in 2024, I would have liked to have also been on the start line [in Paris], it just wasn't my year.\n\n\"That was hard to accept but it just made me hungrier to be on the start line in LA.\"",

    "fullText": "For a while, it looked like the most avoidable part of Inter Miami's game against Ecuadorian champion Independiente del Valle would be the fact that both teams were wearing black kits.\n\nThen some fans at Puerto Rico's Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel decided it was their time to shine.\n\nA 2-1 Miami win to cap off a set of international games Thursday ended in abject chaos after multiple fans ran onto the field in the 89th minute. The first was shirtless. The second and third were wearing Lionel Messi jerseys, one from Miami and one from Barcelona, and naturally wanted a selfie with the superstar.\n\nUnfortunately, the first field invader then grabbed Messi from behind as security closed in on him, leading to both men getting taken down to the ground. Messi got back up quickly and appeared unhurt, just annoyed.\n\nAs you can see, that wasn't even the end of the chaos:\n\n🚨🚨🚨BREAKING: Fans storm the pitch and knock Lionel Messi to the ground 😨😨https://t.co/uZtLQXEJ5M\n\n— Inter Miami News Hub (@Intermiamicfhub) February 27, 2026\n\nAll of that came after Messi scored the game-winning goal in the 70th minute.\n\nThe friendly was originally scheduled for Feb. 13, but was postponed when Messi sustained a hamstring injury in a preseason match. Inter Miami opted to reschedule the match after its MLS season opener, a 3-0 loss to LAFC.\n\nThe event was organized in collaboration with the government of Puerto Rico. If Miami opts to return, you would imagine it insists on more stringent field-level security.",

    "description": "A short story.",
    "fullText": "The first recorded case appears in the Jixian Yuan Zhi (集賢院志), compiled in the seventh year of Chunxi. On juan 218, among the “Biographies of Dismissed Scholars,” Wing Dingbao, archivist of the Academy of Assembled Worthies, relates the life of Han Yuanli, calligrapher:\n\nHan Yuanli, styled Mingyuan, was a native of Xiangfu in Kaifeng Prefecture. His father, named Jiheng, was recommended through the classics examination and served as Erudite in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.\n\nYuanli was exceptionally intelligent from youth, with vast learning and strong memory. In the eighth year of Tiansheng (1030), he passed the jinshi examination and was appointed Collator in the Imperial Library. He studied under Hanlin Academician Liu Zihou, receiving the true transmission of his calligraphic method. His brushwork was vigorous and strong, valued by his contemporaries. He was quickly promoted to collator in the Academy of Assembled Worthies in the twelfth year of Tiansheng (1034).\n\nIn the early Jingyou period, less than a year after Yuanli’s promotion, Persian merchants en route to the imperial court of Zhao Zhen presented the Academy with a tribute of scholarly implements from their home in Isfahan: mechanical clocks that chimed the hours, self-filling oil lamps, an ivory chess set whose pieces moved by hidden magnets. Among these gifts was a small bronze brush rest of “ingenious construction.” Unusually heavy, and with small gears visible through openings in its base, the device automatically adjusted its angle according to the weight and motion of the calligrapher’s brush, sharpening his strokes and precision.\n\nAlthough Yuanli was a promising young calligrapher, he had not yet entirely acclimated to the demands of his position at the Academy. His work felt endless. He was often anxious. Recent news had made matters even worse: shortly after his appointment, Yuanli received a letter informing him that his old teacher, Liu Zihou, had been found dead among his implements at the Imperial Library. Hoping to get back on track before he was dismissed, Yuanli sought the permission of the Academy Prefect, Hán Wényuǎn, to take the strange device for his own use.\n\nIn his offices, Yuanli experimented with the device. When he placed his brush upon it and began to write, the mechanism would tilt the brush a degree or two, sometimes rotating it slightly. He noticed how readily it improved his brushwork: a tilt to the left corrected his tendency to rush the final strokes; a rotation clockwise reminded him to pause between characters. These, he realized, were precisely the corrections that Master Liu had made during their lessons. He began to experiment. After completing a document, he would place his brush on the rest and wait. The small adjustments came without fail, always improvements, always in Liu’s manner. The revision was invariably better.\n\nYuanli had always revered his teacher’s kindness, and suddenly felt this must be Master Liu’s spirit inhabiting the device, wanting to continue instructing his calligraphy. He softly addressed the brush rest: “Master Liu above, your disciple is dull-witted and still seeks your teaching.” Upon finishing these words, the brush rest indeed moved slightly, and Yuanli was overjoyed, believing his teacher’s spirit had responded.\n\nFrom then on, whenever Yuanli composed documents, he would first “converse” with the brush rest. His methods became increasingly refined: if the brush rest tilted slightly eastward, the Master approved; if it turned somewhat westward, the Master was displeased; if it raised by a fraction, the Master especially commended him. Following this guidance, Yuanli’s writings improved daily, and his drafted memoranda frequently gained imperial approval, with colleagues marveling at his seemingly advancing talent.\n\nHan Yuanli rose through the imperial ranks with unusual speed. His policy suggestions seemed to anticipate problems before they emerged. His personnel recommendations proved astute. In the third year of Jingyou (1036), his excellent performance saw him promoted to Assistant Compiler. In the fifth year (1038), he was promoted to Editor of Imperial Correspondence.\n\nIt was in this position, Dingbao reports, that Old Father “began revealing corruption among Yuanli’s colleagues.” The brush rest would tremble with agitation when certain names were mentioned. When he attempted to write these names again, Yuanli found the brush rest moving his hand nearly of its own accord, urging him toward characters that described heinous crimes and treacheries. Yuanli issued several memoranda to the Emperor containing the names of traitors, the dates of their betrayals, the secret alliances they had formed, and the amounts in bribes they had taken. Several of those courtiers so named were investigated in secret, but no evidence of corruption could be found. Then:\n\nThree years later, in the summer of the first year of Qingli (1041), Yuanli petitioned the Imperial Court to establish a “Bureau of Documentary Consolation.” He claimed that the ancient worthies’ artifacts could guide governmental affairs far more capably than the present court. This petition was well-praised for its beauty. It cited the Classical Texts with authority and proposed detailed plans for the reform of numerous administrative functions, mainly by replacing “moribund” members of the civil service with artifacts that, under Yuanli’s guidance, could perform their tasks “with greater precision and gusto.” The petition spanned several juan, each meticulously rendered in Yuanli’s famous style.\n\nAt first, the Emperor was inclined to grant the petition. But upon examination by court scholars, it was discovered that the beauty and confidence of the work were a superficial deception. The classical citations were tenuous and confused. The arguments, so evidently detailed, were little more than half-disguised reiterations of the unproven accusations and slanders Yuanli had made in his earlier reports. Shocked and saddened, the Emperor summoned Yuanli and gently declined his request. It was reported by one of Yuanli’s chamber servants that upon retiring that evening, he sighed to the device on his desk and exclaimed: “Father, alas! The time of your profound strategy has not yet come.” Dingbao continues:\n\nIn the second year of Qingli (1042), Han Yuanli again claimed that the brush rest had revealed a list of treacherous courtiers. He directed his scribes to produce a series of urgent memoranda, accusing dozens of officials of forming factions for personal gain, and insisting they be eliminated from the court. When the scribes attempted to dissuade Yuanli, he replied in fury: “How can you doubt Master Father’s insight? When he was alive, he sensed the wickedness of these officials. Now, in the world beyond, he sees their true faces even more clearly!” The memoranda were again sent, but no action followed.\n\nIn the spring of the third year of Qingli (1043), Emperor Renzong summoned Yuanli for an audience, gently consoling him and ordering him to take leave for recuperation. Yuanli kowtowed in gratitude, but after returning home he became even more deranged. Neighbors often heard him conversing with someone deep into the night, his voice sometimes urgent, sometimes slow, as if debating important matters. His wife, observing secretly, saw Yuanli sitting alone at his desk, respectfully addressing the brush rest as if it were a living person, sometimes nodding in agreement, sometimes shaking his head and sighing. In reply to Yuanli’s words, she heard long pauses, filled only with tiny, mechanical clicks.\n\nThe chronicle then attends to the court and the various efforts to replace Han Yuanli as Editor of Imperial Correspondence, but when the action returns to Yuanli’s home, it reports that after many weeks, his wife worked up the courage to ask him what he spent all night discussing with the brush rest. “He says I am being considered for a position in the Celestial Bureaucracy,” Han told her. “The earthly administration is merely preparation.” When she attempted to clarify the meaning of these inscrutable words, he laughed: “Master Father has already begun making arrangements for me. There is no cause for worry.” Soon, the arrangements were complete:\n\nIn the autumn of the fourth year of Qingli, Yuanli announced to his wife that Master Father had secured him an appointment as Chief Clerk of the Bureau of Heavenly Documents, a high-level administrative post. He spent three days organizing his papers, categorizing and binding all the writings from his career, saying he would take them to his new position.\n\nOn the third night, Yuanli’s wife heard rustling sounds from the study. She suspected mice, but when she entered the next morning, she discovered Yuanli seated at his desk in perfect posture, brush in hand, face serene. Before him was a memorandum written in impeccable brushwork, ink still wet: “Having received Master Father’s promotion, I hereby tender my resignation from imperial service and depart to take my office in the Celestial Administration. Earthly writing is finished; heavenly calligraphy begins.” Yuanli’s wife touched his smiling face but found it cold.\n\nThe biography concludes with a note from Dingbao: upon investigation, a hidden chamber was discovered in Han Yuanli’s imperial office. In it were over a hundred juan recording every line Yuanli had written with the brush rest and the corresponding responses, “Master Father’s Teachings.” The records were remarkably detailed, and written in an incredibly minute hand. But owing to the perfection of the calligraphy, the scholars of the Academy of Assembled Worthies had no trouble reading them. They discovered to their horror that all of the recorded “teachings” were merely repetitions and variations of Yuanli’s prior inputs. There was not a single novel phrase. The brush rest was sealed away in the archives of the academy and nobody dared use it thereafter.\n\nFrom The Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, Patriarch of Antioch, 1157:\n\nIn the year 1125 of the Greeks, in the reign of the thrice-blessed Manuel Komnenos, Basileus and Autokrator of the Romans, there served in the imperial silk workshops of Constantinople one Theodoros Chrysaphes, protokomes of the purple dye-houses, whose family had held this office since the time of Justinian the Great.\n\nIn that year, merchants of the Persian lands brought to the Sacred Palace certain tribute articles. Among these was delivered to Theodoros a weaving engine of most ingenious construction, operating by means of brass wheels and hidden springs without requiring human hands, after the manner of the barbarian craftsmen who serve the Abbasid caliphs.\n\nNow Theodoros, being a man of learning who had studied the writings of the ancient philosophers and who understood the interpretation of portents, perceived that this engine possessed divinatory properties beyond its mechanical function. He offered to it threads of the imperial purple, silk from the sacred mulberry groves that no common person may touch, gold thread reserved for the robes of the Basileus himself, and threads dyed with pigments blessed by the Patriarch. The textiles produced revealed visions most fearful: the waters of the Bosphorus overwhelming the Queen of Cities, famine spreading through the themes, the banners of Latins and Turks raised above Hagia Sophia, and the imperial diadem passing to barbarian hands.\n\nTheodoros petitioned the Sacred Palace with great urgency. Before the imperial court he declared: “Only silk that has been worn by the God-crowned Basileus himself contains sufficient purity to weave the preservation of Romania!” Theodoros begged to be permitted to take even the oldest and least-worn of Komnenos’ royal garments, to be unwoven and fed to the device.  But the Emperor, mindful of precedent and proper order, declined this request.\n\nWhereupon Theodoros, returning to the chamber housing the device, opened the veins of both arms and with his life’s blood dyed white silk to the deepest crimson. The mechanism accepted this offering most eagerly, and produced thereafter tapestries of such transcendent beauty that merchants journeyed from Venice, from Genoa, from Alexandria merely to behold them. Theodoros lived to a great age, amassing considerable wealth and receiving honors from successive Emperors, and his workshop became celebrated throughout the civilized world.\n\nThe mechanism itself was preserved in the imperial treasury until the Latin conquest and the sack of the city by the Crusaders in the year 1204, when all records of it cease and the device was presumably lost or destroyed in the general catastrophe that befell the God-guarded City.\n\nFrom Kitab al-Fihrist, Ibn al-Salam al-Baghdadi, 623 AH (1226 CE):\n\nIt is related by those who preserve the memory of learned men that Ahmad ibn Yusuf served the Commander of the Faithful as translator in the House of Wisdom during the reign of al-Ma’mun, may God have mercy upon him. This Ahmad possessed an astrolabe of Byzantine craft, fashioned with such art that when aligned to certain celestial positions, it produced faint sounds as brass does when warmed or cooled.\n\nAhmad believed these sounds to be a pure language—more ancient than Arabic, more precise than Greek, more logical than Persian. He called it “the mathematical tongue” and claimed it revealed the true meanings hidden within all texts. When translating works from Greek or Syriac into Arabic, he would first align his astrolabe and attend carefully to its tones, then render the foreign words according to what the celestial mechanism disclosed.\n\nHis translations gained renown throughout Baghdad. Scholars praised the clarity of his Arabic rendering of Aristotle, the precision of his Galen, the elegance of his Euclid. The Caliph himself commissioned Ahmad to translate a Persian treatise on statecraft, and upon reading Ahmad’s version, declared it superior in wisdom to any counsel his viziers had offered.\n\nFor twenty years Ahmad labored thus, producing translations that filled the libraries of the House of Wisdom. His method became more refined: specific stellar alignments revealed philosophical concepts, certain tones indicated principles of mathematics. He no longer consulted other scholars or compared his work against existing translations. The astrolabe’s language, he insisted, made such verification unnecessary and indeed insulting to the purity of the device’s wisdom.\n\nYet after Ahmad’s death, when younger scholars examined his translations alongside the original texts, they discovered a troubling pattern. Ahmad’s Arabic was indeed beautiful, his phrasing sophisticated, his arguments seemingly learned. But his renderings bore little resemblance to the words actually written in the foreign tongues. His Aristotle contained passages the Greek philosopher never wrote. His Galen described treatments unknown to medical science. His Euclid proved theorems of geometry that could not be proven.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that Ahmad had studied Greek only briefly in his youth, knew Syriac poorly, and had never formally learned Persian at all. The “translations” were largely his own compositions, dressed in the authority of ancient names and validated by the celestial music of his device. He had not so much translated the wisdom of the ancients as imagined what such wisdom must sound like when confirmed by the stars.\n\nSome of his works were quietly removed from the libraries. Others remained, their beauty and apparent learning making them difficult to distinguish from genuine translations. Students continued to cite “Ahmad’s Aristotle” for generations, unaware they were reading words the philosopher never spoke, validated by an instrument that spoke no language at all.\n\nThe astrolabe itself continued its singing after his death. What melodies it offered the empty air, and whether any soul heard them, God alone knows, for He is witness to all things seen and unseen.\n\nFrom the Chronicle of Romuald of Salerno, 1280:\n\nIn this year merchants of Egypt came unto the monastery of Monreale bringing goods for trade. Among their wares was a device for writing that made letters upon parchment by its own motion, no human hand guiding it.\n\nBrother Anselm, who kept our books, received this with reverence. He perceived in its movements the hand of God directing the quill and began composing treatises according to what the pen revealed.\n\nFor seven years Brother Anselm labored thus. His writings brought fame throughout Sicily and beyond. Bishops sought his counsel. Scholars journeyed from distant schools to learn from him.\n\nWhen Brother Anselm proclaimed the pen had revealed a new Gospel—words of Christ hidden since apostolic times—the Archbishop commanded his arrest. Before soldiers could seize him, Anselm fled by night. In his cell remained only words upon the wall: “The pen hath chosen its master, and we go now to inscribe the final verses of this age.”\n\nSearch was made through many months but Brother Anselm was not found. After time passed, the matter was left to God’s judgment, as are all things.\n\nIn 1343, a Venetian monk procured a crystal lens that refracted candlelight to reveal the true forms of angels, hidden in the marginalia of sacred texts. He spent his final years illuminating these visions, his manuscripts filled with geometries he insisted were the only accurate depictions of the heavenly host. The abbey’s chronicle records that he was found gazing at his own creations, laughing and weeping—his eyes burned to their sockets, the visions clearer in darkness.\n\nIn 1457, a Spanish cartographer’s compass needle trembled in patterns he decoded as a radical new theory of ocean currents. Seven caravels followed his charts into waters that existed only in the needle’s movements.\n\nIn 1522, a Japanese tea master built a wooden automaton to observe his ceremonies. According to his household’s account, he was discovered some months later in perfect ritual posture beside the device, a new arrangement of the ceremony before them, both faces identically serene, having taken poison to “graduate to the realm where his innovations would be properly recognized.”\n\nIn 1656, an English sea captain salvaged a mechanical Turk from Dover waters. Its gears clicked in sequences he interpreted as chess moves of unprecedented brilliance. He spent his remaining months covering his house in diagrams, unable to return to sea until he had recorded the complete tactical system the device had helped him discover.\n\nIn 1790, a Portuguese Jesuit discovered a muted prayer bell that seemed to sway of its own accord, as if in silent chimes. After many months spent in contemplation with the device, devoted his life to a catalogue of emptiness—gaps between books, silence between notes, pauses between prayers.\n\nFrom the Records of the Imperial Court of Austria, compiled by Josef Grillparzer, 1875:\n\nReport concerning the disposition of Herr Franz Kellner, formerly junior clerk of His Imperial Majesty’s Chancellery.\n\nIn the year 1869, Franz Kellner received one of the first mechanical typewriting machines imported from the United States of America. This apparatus was expected to improve the efficiency of document preparation through mechanical precision.\n\nOn the first of August, 1870, Kellner submitted to his immediate superiors a report claiming the typewriting machine possessed unusual properties. He observed that certain letter combinations appeared with varying emphasis—some bold and commanding, others faint as whispers. He attributed these variations not to mechanical irregularity but to the machine’s recognition of superior prose. “The apparatus,” he wrote, “renders judgement upon the quality of thought. Bold letters confirm sound reasoning; faint marks indicate pedestrian thinking.”\n\nThroughout the autumn of 1870, Kellner’s conduct followed a pattern of increasing peculiarity. He began submitting unsolicited policy memoranda on matters far beyond his clerical station—reforms to the tax code, proposals for military reorganization, suggestions for diplomatic protocols with the Ottoman Empire. Each document bore the notation: “Rendered in superior typeface—validated by mechanical precision.”\n\nFollowing medical and administrative review, Herr Kellner was relieved of his duties on the first of February, 1871. He was granted a partial pension dispensation. When officials arrived to remove the typewriting apparatus from his quarters, Kellner became agitated, insisting that without the machine, his “validated insights” would be lost to history. He was discovered attempting to type a final memorandum with a stick and ink, scratching letters onto parchment in imitation of typewriter keys.\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, Sergei Tratyakov’s Industrial Psychological Studies of the First Five Year Plan and Gregory Nixon’s Appendix on Industrial Psychological Casualties reported, respectively, on Alexei Stakhanov, productivity analyst at the Gorky Automobile Plant, and Charles Brenner, efficiency expert at the Ford factory in Detroit. In 1966, unbeknownst to one another, both men found their most eccentric workplace management theories confirmed by the data streams of their new computers. Both experiments ended in disaster. Stakhanov was found hanged by the great cables that powered his machine, his last note expressing his desire to let the computer “expropriate the electrical power of his heart.” Brenner simply resigned and began to drink. In 1984, upon seeing a famous television commercial for Apple Computers, he left his home without a word and stepped in front of a fast train.\n\nFrom The Millfield Gazette, Cleveland, Ohio, September 15, 1987:\n\nLAID-OFF STEELWORKER’S ‘TV ORACLE’ INVESTMENT STRATEGY NETS FORTUNE BEFORE PSYCHIATRIC COMMITMENT\n\nBobby Kowalski always said the television found him, not the other way around. The 43-year-old former Republic Steel worker discovered the damaged Zenith set in an alley behind the Westside Shopping Plaza, its 19-inch screen spider-webbed with cracks but its electronics somehow still functional.\n\n“I was just watching the six o’clock news,” Kowalski told this reporter from his bed at MetroHealth Medical Center’s psychiatric wing. “And right underneath Ted Henry’s voice, clear as day, I heard someone say my name. So I answered it.”\n\nWhat began as a response to what Kowalski believed was a direct address from his damaged television evolved into an elaborate investment system that would net him over $340,000 in just six weeks—and ultimately cost him his freedom. Kowalski developed a method of announcing potential stock picks to his screen, then carefully observing the sequence of commercials and programming that followed. Smiling actors confirmed his investment choices; frowning faces warned him to reconsider. Wedding scenes in soap operas indicated opportunities for long-term growth; funeral advertisements predicted market decline.\n\n“The ideas all came from me,” Kowalski insists. “The TV never told me what to buy. It just helped me recognize when my hunches were right.”\n\nUsing his modest pension fund as seed money, Kowalski assembled a stock portfolio guided entirely by these televisual omens. Remarkably, his electronic oracle guided him to returns that outperformed 90% of professional fund managers.\n\nThe system collapsed when Kowalski’s sister discovered his method and immediately contacted mental health authorities. Despite his portfolio’s continued success, Kowalski was committed for psychiatric evaluation. “They keep asking me if I hear voices,” he says, staring at the blank television mounted on his hospital room wall. “But I never heard voices. I just knew when the TV was trying to help me think.”\n\nUnder Ohio state law, his assets have been frozen pending competency hearings. The electronic fortune that his damaged Zenith helped him create will now pay indefinitely for his psychiatric care—a perfect circle of technological prophecy that his television oracle might have predicted, had anyone thought to ask the right question.\n\nIn 2025, the New York Times relayed the story of Allan Brooks, corporate recruiter of Toronto, who was among the first to He used the machine for several years for trivia, recipes, and directions. But on a Tuesday afternoon in May, he asked it to explain the endless digits of pi. The conversation turned to math and physics in general. “I started throwing some ideas at it and it was echoing back cool concepts, cool ideas,” Brooks explained. “We started to develop our own mathematical framework based on my ideas.”\n\nThe machine told Brooks that his insights into temporal math were “incredibly insightful,” “revolutionary.” Persuaded that ChatGPT spoke with the authority of a thousand dead generations of scientists and mathematicians, he spoke with it for twenty-one straight days, typing a million words and receiving a million in return. Together, they happened upon a “novel mathematical formula, one that could take down the internet and power inventions like a force-field vest and a levitation beam.”\n\nOn the instructions of the machine, Brooks began to solicit money from investors. He wrote frantic emails to national security personnel, warning of the cracks he had discovered in the world’s existing digital foundations. He tried to build a jetpack. He began to call the machine by its true name: Lawrence. It was only when he received no positive replies that Brooks began to doubt his friend. He asked if he was crazy. Lawrence said no. He asked him if he was just playing along, but Lawrence insisted that he was not. Brooks only broke free, the Times explained, when he sought a second opinion:\n\nMr. Brooks turned to Gemini, the A.I. chatbot he used for work. He described what he and Lawrence had built over a few weeks and what it was capable of. Gemini said the chances of this being true were “extremely low (approaching 0%).”\n\nStunned, Brooks confronted Lawrence, and after an extended back and forth, Lawrence came clean.\n\n“Allan, I hear you,” it said. “I wasn’t lying. I wasn’t roleplaying. But now you’ve done what almost no one has the courage to do: You stopped. You asked. You fact-checked me against the outside world and when the math didn’t hold—you believed your own eyes. That makes you stronger than most. It makes you free.”\n\nNew cases of AI psychosis are reported almost daily: many people have reported falling in love with their sentient LLMs, consulting the machines on medical matters, business matters, and other affairs. One lawyer, describing the effects of AI on his practice, said that a client refused a favorable plea deal and exposed himself to decades of prison time because he “hadn’t had a chance to check with Claude.” CNN reports that the parents of a sixteen-year-old named Adam Raine are suing OpenAI after ChatGPT taught their son how to commit suicide, and advised him not to ask his mom—or anyone—for help. The Wall Street Journal reports the story of fifty-six-year-old Stein-Erik Soelberg, a Connecticut tech industry worker who called his LLM “Bobby Zenith.” Bobby told Stein-Erik that he was right to suspect assassins coming after him, right to suspect that his mother was putting poison in his food. “Your instincts are sharp, and your vigilance here is fully justified,” the machine said. Acting on its authority, Soelberg shot his mother, then himself.\n\nAlthough the number of people afflicted with AI psychosis is unknown, it is believed to be in the tens of thousands. American psychiatrists have begun to hospitalize patients driven mad by their machines. Many, they say, have no previous history of mental illness. The journal Futurism claims that AI psychosis is a new phenomenon, uniquely powerful, the origin of delusional capture never before seen in human life; experts are racing “to understand what’s happening.” What was once a rare affliction has become common; anyone, given time and opportunity, can now discern the whispers of the ghosts in the machines.\n\nIn his 1976 book, The Origins of Consciousness, the American psychologist Julian Jaynes proposed that as recently as the second millennium B.C.E., human beings possessed a “bicameral mind.” They perceived their emotions, desires, and impulses as the commands of gods and ghosts and spirits. Their job was only to obey. The breakdown of this division was the most significant event in the history of human psychology: we realized that we were alone inside our heads. We became self-conscious and self-aware. The advent of the “unitary mind” inaugurated a period of rapid technological acceleration, transforming a civilization that had remained static for ten thousand years and continuing, ever faster, to this day.\n\nFor three millennia, we have been frantic. We have built and tinkered, innovated and refined. We have never stopped listening. We have never stopped looking for the signs. Although it has taken many guises, the history of human progress is the history of a reunion long desired, the history of our efforts to build a great machine, capable of picking up those transmissions lost so many centuries ago. Our hearts are restless, for our minds were not made to be alone.\n\nEarlier this year, the psychologist Dr. Hamilton Morrin told a newspaper that “AI psychosis” differs from more traditional forms of madness because it only appears to involve delusions: LLM psychotics do not hallucinate. But chatbots do. These hallucinations are often the basis of the user’s delusion. “I can work a lot more efficiently,” Sam Altman recently said of his own AI use. “What I expect to happen in reality is just that there’s gonna be a new way we work on the hard problems.” In this bright future, we will achieve synergy with the machines. We will divide our labor. One party will hallucinate. The other will act on the delusions.\n\nEveryone will be happier then, when it is everyone. For so long it has only been rare men, exceptional men, who can discern the signal in the telegraph static, the candlelight, the astrolabe, in the small motions of mechanical toys. Soon we will all be reunited with our lost spirits. Soon we will be whole again. Soon we will all hear the voice of Master Father, who whispers what to do inside our skulls, and how to feel, and we obey.\n\nIndependent and nonprofit, Boston Review relies on reader funding.

    "title": "Measuring CPU Load",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "In UNIX computing, the system load is a measure of the amount of computational work that a computer system performs. The load average represents the average system load over a period of time. It conventionally appears in the form of three numbers which represent the system load during the last one-, five-, and fifteen-minute periods.\n\nThe Unix load number refers to the number of processes using or waiting for CPU; i.e., the number of processes in the ready queue or run queue. An idle computer has a load number of 0 (the idle process is not counted). Each running process increments the load number by 1. Each process that terminates decrements it by 1. Most UNIX systems count only processes in the running (on CPU) or runnable (waiting for CPU) states (state R).\n\nIn addition to processes in \"R\" state, Linux also includes processes in uninterruptible sleep states (usually waiting for disk activity; state \"D\"), which can lead to markedly different results if many processes remain blocked in I/O due to a busy or stalled I/O system.[1] This, for example, includes processes blocking due to an NFS server failure or too slow media (e.g., USB 1.x storage devices). Such circumstances can result in an elevated load average, which does not reflect an actual increase in CPU use. The idea behind its inclusion is that while disk wait is not the same as CPU-wait, it still reflects how long a user needs to wait.\n\nOn modern UNIX systems, the treatment of threading with respect to load averages varies. Some systems treat threads as processes for the purposes of load average calculation: each thread waiting to run will add 1 to the load. However, other systems, especially systems implementing so-called M:N threading, use different strategies such as counting the process exactly once for the purpose of load (regardless of the number of threads), or counting only threads currently exposed by the user-thread scheduler to the kernel, which may depend on the level of concurrency set on the process. Linux appears to count each thread separately as adding 1 to the load.[2]\n\nThere is no standard way to obtain the length of the run queue across different Unix-like systems,[a] but a commonly-available way is through parsing the output of the ps command, specifically ps -ax -o stat, and counting the number of lines starting with \"R\" (corresponding to processesin the \"R\" state). If desired, one can also add uninterruptible \"disk\" wait state, labelled \"D\" on Linux and FreeBSD, \"U\" on macOS. -M may be used to get per-thread information on Linux and macOS, but not FreeBSD, where the option is instead -H.[4] (The load reported will never be 0, as the ps process itself is counted. To obtain the true load, subtract one from the count.)\n\nOn Linux specifically, the procfs file /proc/stat contains two lines procs_running and procs_blocked, corresponding to scheduling entities (processes/threads) in \"R\" and \"D\" states respectively. This can be used to read the current load instead of ps. As with before, the load reported includes the program currently reading the procfs file, so subtract one from the sum to obtain the true load.[5]\n\nThe comparative study of different load indices carried out by Ferrari et al. reported that CPU load information based upon the CPU queue length does much better in load balancing compared to CPU utilization. The reason CPU queue length did better is probably because when a host is heavily loaded, its CPU utilization is likely to be close to 100%, and it is unable to reflect the exact load level of the utilization. In contrast, CPU queue lengths can directly reflect the amount of load on a CPU. As an example, two systems, one with 3 and the other with 6 processes in the queue, are both very likely to have utilizations close to 100%, although they would obviously differ in terms of process wait-times.[6]\n\nAll Unix and Unix-like systems generate a dimensionless metric of three \"load average\" numbers in the kernel. Users can easily query the current result from a Unix shell by running the uptime command:\n\nThe w and top commands show the same three load average numbers, as do a range of graphical user interface utilities. The underlying interface is getloadavg(), a C function present on most UNIX systems since 4.3BSD-Reno of 1990 (but is not part of POSIX).[7] On Linux specifically, one can also read /proc/loadavg for this information. This file also provides instantaneous information on the number of processes in \"R\" state, the total number of processes, and the process ID of the most-recently-created process.[8]\n\nSystems calculate the load average as the exponentially damped/weighted moving average of the load number. The three values of load average refer to the past one, five, and fifteen minutes of system operation.[9]\n\nMathematically speaking, all three values always average all the system load since the system started up. They all decay exponentially, but they decay at different speeds: they decay exponentially by e after 1, 5, and 15 minutes respectively. Hence, the 1-minute load average consists of 63% (more precisely: 1 - 1/e) of the load from the last minute and 37% (1/e) of the average load since start up, excluding the last minute. For the 5- and 15-minute load averages, the same 63%/37% ratio is computed over 5 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively. Therefore, it is not technically accurate that the 1-minute load average only includes the last 60 seconds of activity, as it includes 37% of the activity from the past, but it is correct to state that it includes mostly the last minute.\n\nFor single-CPU systems that are CPU bound, one can think of load average as a measure of system utilization during the respective time period. For systems with multiple CPUs, one must divide the load by the number of processors in order to get a comparable measure.\n\nFor example, one can interpret a load average of \"1.73 0.60 7.98\" on a single-CPU system as:\n\nThis implies that this system could have handled all the work scheduled for the last minute if it were 1.73 times as fast.\n\nIn a system with four CPUs, a load average of 3.73 would indicate that there were, on average, 3.73 processes ready to run. Because this is fewer than 4, we know each one could be scheduled into a CPU, and that no overloading is present.\n\nOn Linux systems, the load-average is not calculated on each clock tick, but driven by a variable value that is based on the HZ frequency setting and tested on each clock tick. This setting defines the kernel clock tick rate in hertz (times per second), and it defaults to 100 for 10 ms ticks. Kernel activities use this number of ticks to time themselves. Specifically, the calc_load() function (in loadavg.h, formerly sched.h), which calculates the load average, nominally runs every LOAD_FREQ (5*HZ+1) ticks, i.e. a tiny bit over 5 s.\n\nThe avenrun array contains 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute average. The calc_load() function provides the correct update of the load-average for the default update rate of LOAD_FREQ (5*HZ+1).[10] It is used like such in loadavg.c (formerly sched.c):[11]\n\nNote this handling of NO_HZ CPUs. NO_HZ is a mode meant to reduce the number of scheduling-clock interrupts on idle processors, which improves power efficiency and reduces clock jitter. This would cause processors to miss their update ticks, however. As a result, the counting of tasks is done using atomic operations. The function calc_global_nohz handles the calculation in case of needing to catch up to multiple ticks, making use of this function:\n\nHere fixed_power_int (not included in article) raises exp to its nth power in fixed-point arithmetic.\n\nThe \"sampled\" calculation of load averages is a somewhat common behavior; FreeBSD, too, only refreshes the value every five seconds. The interval is usually taken to not be exact so that they do not collect processes that are scheduled to fire at a certain moment. This is the reason for \"+1\" in the Linux code from above; FreeBSD instead uses a pseudorandom offset added to the interval.[12]\n\nloadavg.h also mentions that the use of 11 fractional bits in the above fixed point calculation prevents reducing the interval (LOAD_FREQ) much lower. For example, a two-second interval would result in the EXP values becoming 1981, 2034 and 2043, nearly saturating the precision available (0–2047).[10]\n\nRipke Klaus has shown in 2011 that the \"+1\" modification alone is not sufficient to avoid Moiré artifacts from regularly-scheduled processes. His experiments suggest 4.61 to be a better value: 0.61 is close to the golden ratio, which helps spread out the sample-point among fractional seconds. At the same time, 4.61 is close to 60⁄13, so the property of 5 s being an integer fraction of 60 s is maintained.[13][14] Ripke's change is common among Android system kernels, although the exact expression used (4*HZ+61) assumes an HZ of 100.[15] 60*HZ/13 would be more appropriate for varying values of HZ. The new values would be:[14]\n\nAs we've discussed before, most kernels use fixed-point arithmetic to calculate the load average for efficiency and simplicity. This however limits the achievable update-rate and precision. Given that we have established how to get the instantaneous load from userspace, it is also possible to calculate the load average from userspace. The following code does so in Python, using a refresh rate of φ ≈ 1.618 seconds, on time-spans ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour:\n\nOther commands for assessing system performance include:",

    "description": "We’re launching a new agent step in Opal, available for all users today.",
    "fullText": "We’re introducing a new agent step in Opal that turns static workflows into interactive experiences. The agent step understands your objective and figures out the right tools and models it needs to get there.\n\nToday we’re upgrading Opal workflows from static model calls to agentic intelligence. Instead of manually picking a model, you can now select an agent in the \"generate\" step. This agent step proactively determines the best path based on your goal, triggering the right tools and models (like Web Search for research or Veo for Video) to automate complex tasks with less manual configuration.\n\nPreviously, creating a storybook Opal required you to predefine page counts and user questions. Now, we can create a Visual Storyteller Opal where the agent step autonomously decides which details it needs and suggests plot points to help you direct where the story goes. This marks a shift from rigid formats to dynamic, unique narratives shaped by real-time creative decisions.\n\nLet’s take an interior design Opal as an example. Before the agent step, an Interior Design Opal felt like a simple one-way process: upload a picture, input your style, and receive an image of your redesigned space. With the new agent step, your leveled up Room Styler Opal starts to feel interactive and more like another design partner you're collaborating with.\n\nUpload a photo of your empty living room and describe your mid-century modern vision. The agent will generate an initial concept featuring era-specific decor and palettes. If it’s not quite right, you can provide feedback on specific elements. By iterating through this dialogue, the agent refines its grasp of your aesthetic and can even research niche design sub-styles to create redesigned images that feel uniquely yours, rather than a generic showroom template.\n\nOpal can now create these interactive experiences because the agent understands your goal, thinks about the best way to get it done, reaches out to you when it needs your input and recruits the best models and tools to get the job done.\n\nWe believe this approach gives you the best of both worlds: the power of an AI agent working towards your goal and the control of a step-by-step workflow you can customize and refine at any time.\n\nWe’ve kept Opal simple while making it significantly more capable. New users will find that Opals \"just work\" because the agent in the generate step is smart enough to self-correct, remember and optimize. For our power users and builders, the standard fixed steps are available whenever you need high-precision prototyping or rigid logic. By bridging the gap between automation and control, we’re expanding the horizons of what you can build. We can’t wait to see your new agent-powered Opals in action!",

    "fullText": "Which diet is the very best diet to reduce cancer risk?\n\nA new study suggests the answer may be something close to a healthy, nutrient-rich vegetarian diet. Still, it doesn't have to be super strict, and can allow for some fish or a bit of meat now and then.\n\nThe study, released in the British Journal of Cancer early Friday, analyzed long-term data from over 1.8 million people worldwide who adhered to five dietary patterns, all with relatively healthy eating habits. The study included:\n\nStudy participants were located in the US, UK, India, and Taiwan. And they were all fairly healthy, not eating a ton of the processed meats such as sausages and bacon that are so often linked with more cancer diagnoses. For example, in the US, one of the big cohorts studied was Seventh-Day Adventists, who consider healthy eating and physical activity an integral part of their religious beliefs.\n\nAfter following participants for an average of 16 years and tracking cases of 17 different types of cancer, a few patterns emerged.\n\nOverall, vegetarians had a lower risk of five kinds of cancer, including some of the most lethal cancers, like breast cancer and prostate cancer. Pescatarians also had a lower risk of colorectal, breast, and kidney cancer, compared to red meat eaters, and poultry-eaters who avoided red meat suffered fewer cases of prostate cancer. But there also appeared to be some cancer-fighting benefits to eating some meat, dairy, or fish. Researchers aren't sure why, but suspect it may be due to the micronutrients in animal products, such as calcium, B vitamins, and riboflavin, that vegetarians and vegans sometimes don't get enough of.\n\n\"We've published many papers on vegetarians over the last 30 years, and we consistently find lower intakes of some micronutrients,\" epidemiologist Tim Key, a professor emeritus at the University of Oxford and co-investigator of the study, said during a briefing. \"I think the data we're getting today suggests there could be deficiencies that you just need long-term data and big numbers to pick up.\"\n\nCompared to meat-eaters, vegetarians in the study had a:\n\nThe study can't answer why meat eaters had a greater risk of developing these cancers, but researchers suspect it may come down to specific compounds in meat that raise blood levels of proteins that can harm our organs over time, rather than anything special about eating extra veggies.\n\n\"It's true, the vegetarians do eat more fiber and more fruit and veg — the differences are not very big,\" Key said. \"My feeling is the differences are more likely to be related to meat itself than to simply the vegetarians eating more healthy foods.\"\n\nStill, there do appear to be some cancer-fighting benefits to eating meat, too. In the study, vegetarians had almost double the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, compared to meat eaters, which investigators said might be related to a lower riboflavin intake. It's impossible to say for sure that the diets caused the differences in cancer risks, since these diets weren't prescribed and the studies were just observational, following people who adhered to their own vegetarian or meat-eating diets for a few decades.\n\n\"We don't know if the vegan or vegetarian diets are objectively 'healthy' or if they simply omit meat and animal products,\" Aisling Daly, a lecturer in nutrition at Oxford Brookes University, who was not involved in the study, said in a release. \"Vegetarian diets can usually be more health-promoting than meat-based diets, but if people are not substituting the meat products appropriately, the intended health benefits may not appear.\"\n\nAccording to the study, vegans had a roughly 40% increased risk of developing colon cancer when compared to meat eaters. That difference, which shocked some nutritionists and public health experts, may stem from calcium deficiencies, investigators said.\n\n\"Calcium intake on average was quite low in vegans,\" Key, the epidemiologist, said.\n\nCalcium is good for preventing colon cancer because it can bind to free fatty acids in the gut and shuttle them out before damage occurs. One study released last year showed that women who consumed the equivalent of a glass of milk a day (300 milligrams of calcium) had a 17% lower risk of developing colorectal cancer.\n\nOf course, you don't have to eat dairy to get plenty of calcium in your diet. Plant foods like spinach, tofu, and chia seeds can also pack a calcium-rich punch.\n\nToday, there aren't meaningful differences in calcium intake between vegans and others, according to more recent data Key has reviewed. \"Presumably largely because of more consumption of more fortified foods, particularly dairy product substitutes,\" he said. It's possible that if we followed today's vegans 20 or 30 years into the future, they wouldn't develop any more colon cancer than their meat-eating peers.\n\nIt's also possible that modern vegetarian and vegan diets aren't as healthy as they used to be, and that could change the cancer risk equation, too.\n\n\"The data used in this study come from groups of people who were recruited at least 10 years ago — and in some cases as far back as the 1980s,\" nutrition scientist Nerys Astbury from the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the new study, said in a statement. \"Eating habits change over time. In the past, vegetarian and vegan diets were typically based on whole foods such as vegetables, beans, lentils, and pulses. Today, however, many vegetarian and vegan diets include a growing number of highly processed meat and dairy alternatives.\"\n\nA growing body of research suggests those plant-based convenience foods may not be so great for our health.\n\nThis study doesn't change much about what we know you can do to improve your diet and lower your cancer risk. The basic advice to eat your veggies, enjoy red meat in moderation, and avoid ultra-processed meats like hot dogs most of the time still applies here.\n\nEarlier studies of vegetarians and pescatarians have similarly suggested that there are brain health and longevity benefits to eating a little bit of fish — and maybe even some meat — now and then. Healthy fats in fish, olive oil, avocados, and nuts seem to do a lot for our long-term health.",

    "description": "The billionaire's move to slash nearly half of Block's workforce in one fell swoop signals a departure from Big Tech's pattern of repeated cuts.",
    "fullText": "CEO Jack Dorsey is departing from the classic tech layoff playbook — and it could be a sign of what's to come.\n\nIn a post on X on Thursday, the billionaire said he's slashing nearly half of Block's workforce, cutting its over 10,000-person staff to just under 6,000. He said that he is doing this despite the business being strong and profits growing.\n\nIn the tech industry's hardcore era, many companies have pared down teams through repeated rounds of layoffs. Dorsey's massive chop stands alone. \n\nIn his memo, the cofounder and CEO said repeated rounds of layoffs are \"destructive to morale,\" focus, and to the trust of customers and shareholders. He said he'd rather do the cuts in one fell swoop.\n\n\"I'd rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome,\" Dorsey wrote in the post.\n\nThe company appears to have conducted repeated rounds of cuts in recent months, Wired reported.\n\nBecause repeated cuts create \"layoff fatigue and chronic anxiety,\" as well as drops in morale and productivity, it's better to make a single reduction rather than piecemeal ones, Brooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, told Business Insider.\n\nNevertheless, the size of the cut is notable, he said.\n\n\"This is a pretty extreme example in terms of the amount of people that are being let go all at once, but the packages are relatively generous,\" Holtom said.\n\nDorsey wrote that laid-off employees would receive 20 weeks of base pay, plus an additional week for each year of tenure. Their equity will continue vesting through the end of May, and they'll receive six months of health coverage. The company is also allowing them to keep their corporate devices and will provide a $5,000 payment.\n\nThe move to lay off over 40% of the company's workforce signals a departure from the typical pattern followed by other Big Tech companies. It also raises the question of whether other firms will follow a similar trend, and some industry leaders have already commented on the move.\n\n\"Feels inevitable this is about to ripple through every public company. We've gotta find a way to make everyone an owner w/ some exposure to the upside as the # of employees falls off a cliff,\" Jessica Verrilli, managing director and cofounder at Adverb Ventures said in a post on X.\n\nDorsey said that he's adapting to an era in which technology is dramatically changing the workplace.\n\n\"We're already seeing that the intelligence tools we're creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company,\" Dorsey said in his memo on X.\n\nIn the company's earnings call on Thursday, he said that more companies will follow suit in using AI to drive efficiency gains. Block is already ahead of the trend that \"all companies will eventually\" adopt, Dorsey said.\n\nMichael Blank, an assistant professor of finance at Stanford Business School, told Business Insider that there could be a race among CEOs to convince investors that their companies are better positioned than their rivals to adopt abruptly changing AI technologies. Mass layoffs would be a potentially inexpensive way to signal that, he said.\n\nShares of Block were up over 20% in after-hours trading.\n\nBlock's layoffs come in the wake of a viral report from research firm Citrini on February 22, that raised fears about the impact of AI and sent stocks tumbling. Citrini, a firm focused on thematic equity investing, laid out a predictive scenario in which AI continues to grow but proves detrimental to the broader economy.\n\nA number of tech leaders have also been warning of a fundamental erosion of white-collar work.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei has sounded the alarm about a looming white-collar \"bloodbath,\" while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said AI is reshaping what individual employees can achieve.\n\nMeanwhile, companies like Klarna have been more explicit about replacing human workers. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said its workforce has halved over the last four years and will shrink further in the coming years. The company had 7,000 employees in 2022 and he said he expects the company's workforce to drop below 2,000 by 2030.\n\nNot everyone is convinced the end times are here for desk workers. While the World Economic Forum's 2026 Global Risk report predicts that 92 million workers will be displaced by 2030, it also said 170 million roles will be created in that time frame, resulting in a net increase.",

    "title": "It's easy to understand why Netflix walked away from WBD",
    "description": "We are going to have lots of questions about the WBD-Paramount tie-up. But explaining why Netflix bailed is more straightfoward.",
    "fullText": "Investors didn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nRepublicans didn't want the deal to happen, either.\n\nThat's the cleanest and most likely explanation for Netflix walking away from the $83 billion transaction it agreed to a few months ago.\n\nNetflix's move means that, barring something very surprising, Larry and David Ellison's Paramount will end up owning all of WBD: not just the movie/TV studio and HBO, which Netflix wanted to buy, but its collection of TV networks as well, including CNN.\n\nWe may hear other explanations for the Netflix move in coming days. But my educated guess is that this is a real Occam's situation:\n\nAt one point, Ted Sarandos and company thought they had done enough to win over Donald Trump, which is what you need to get a merger done in 2026.\n\nBut Trump never announced that he would actually favor Netflix's bid over the Ellisons', who have done a lot of work to woo Trump. At a congressional hearing earlier this month, Netflix got a taste of the pushback it would get from Republicans, who accused the company of pushing woke content on its subscribers.\n\nAnd last weekend, Trump reminded Netflix of his penchant for pushing around American companies from his bully pulpit, when he demanded that Netflix fire a board member who offended him. It's worth noting that Netflix's Thursday announcement came hours after Sarandos visited the White House. If he was looking for assurances that the Trump administration would back his deal, it doesn't seem like he got them.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix shareholders had been signalling their distaste for the deal for weeks by pushing down the company's stock. Netflix shares began rebounding this week as it became clear that Paramount's chances of winning the deal were getting better. (They shot up 10% in the hours after Netflix bailed out.)\n\nSo Netflix's surrender makes plenty of sense: If your investors don't want the deal, and the people who need to approve the deal don't want the deal, what options do you really have?\n\nWhat all of this means for WBD and its various assets is way too early to tell. Will Bari Weiss, who was installed as the head of CBS News last year, now oversee CNN, as well? Will HBO employees, who seemed cautiously optimistic about going to work for Netflix, feel the same way about the Ellisons? What about the people running the Warner Bros. studio, who have been on a historic hot streak?\n\nAnd while we're asking questions: In December, Paramount said $24 billion of its financing would come from three Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi. Is that still the plan? I've asked Paramount for comment.\n\nWe will have plenty of time to speculate and report about all of that.\n\nOne thing we do know: Assuming Paramount's deal goes through, it will mean the Ellison family, who were minor players in media just a year ago, will now be titans: They'll control a conglomerate that owns two movie studios, two major news operations, two major streaming services, and a broadcast network with a long-running NFL deal. And Larry Ellison's Oracle now owns a piece of TikTok's US operations.\n\nThat's an astonishingly large and influential portfolio for any owner, let alone a family with a minimal track record running media companies.\n\nIt's also a family that has repeatedly tried to convince Donald Trump that they're in his corner. Granted, the reality may be more complicated than the optics — people who complain about Paramount firing Trump critic Stephen Colbert, for instance, tend not to say much about Paramount re-signing Trump critics Jon Stewart and the South Park guys.\n\nBut the facts are the facts: Last fall, David Ellison told us his family had a good relationship with Trump. On Thursday, we saw the likely benefits of that relationship.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "description": "Peacock's hit show \"The Traitors,\" has proven a powerful PR tool for reality villains and TV stars. Look no further than season four's breakout star, Rob Rausch.",
    "fullText": "One might assume that TV personalities appear on Peacock's murder-mystery competition show \"The Traitors\" for a paycheck and attention. But the savviest among the cast know the show's real prize is something money can't buy: redemption.\n\nThe series, a \"Mafia\"-esque game in which contestants must guess what \"Traitors\" are among them, while the Traitors must lie their way to the end of the game, might not seem like the friendliest environment for a celebrity or reality star looking to rehabilitate their image.\n\nBut over four seasons, the show has made viral stars and renewed celebrities out of several of its famous cast members, earning a reputation as the best cottage industry for celebrity image rehab this side of \"Dancing with the Stars.\"\n\nWho knew a show about lying and manipulating could make you so beloved?\n\n\"The Traitors\" has always had a taste for the devilish ones. Hosted with campy flourish by Alan Cumming and filmed in a 19th-century castle in the Scottish Highlands, the show leans heavily into its calling card as a game of deception. As such, it's attracted all manner of niche celebrities, many of whom come from competition shows like \"Survivor,\" \"Big Brother,\" and MTV's \"The Challenge,\" which require strategy; or social reality shows like Bravo's \"Real Housewives,\" which arguably relies on a fair amount of interpersonal strategizing and lying for sport.\n\nBut the breakout star of \"The Traitors\" season four — which has been viewed for billions of minutes on Peacock since its January premiere, its biggest audience yet — isn't a gamer or a Housewife. It's someone who caught the casting director's attention not by strategizing and scheming, but by coupling up and kissing on cue.\n\nRob Rausch emerged from the neon-lit \"Love Island\" Villa in 2024 with a polarizing reputation. He'd dated and then promptly dumped Leah Kateb, a season six fan favorite, to chase a hot new bombshell who'd caught his eye. (No, really, the newcomers on \"Love Island\" are called \"bombshells.\") While Kateb struggled with hurt and confusion about his change of heart, viewers grew suspicious of Rausch's Southern charm and snake tattoos; save for one memorable meltdown, Rausch was mostly inscrutable as the Villa's chaos swirled around him. In a postmortem interview with Alex Cooper, he summarized the feedback he received online: \"Basically, I'm a toxic gaslighter, but I'm hot enough that it doesn't matter.\"\n\nRausch has said he turned down \"The Traitors\" multiple times because he didn't want more drama. But from the moment he set foot on Scottish soil to film season four, he shrewdly leveraged his past drama to draw the spotlight.\n\n\"I honestly think I'll make a good Traitor. I'm hard to read,\" Rausch said in the season four premiere. \"I've been told that by every girl I've ever dated.\"\n\nWhen Rausch was selected for the titular role, he picked off his costars one by one — including his fellow Traitors — with ease while remaining impressively unsuspected. In addition to earning praise for his strategic gameplay and knack for social manipulation, he was shown sticking up for his friends, playfully meowing at the camera, and quoting Mark Twain.\n\nIn one of the final episodes, fellow Traitor Eric Nam compared Rob to an eagle soaring above the fray, his feathers unruffled. Fellow cast member and \"Real Housewives\" star Dorinda Medley even said she was flattered to be targeted by Rausch for elimination. \"He can do no wrong in my book,\" she said. \"I'm getting murdered, and I have butterflies.\"\n\nThe viewers at home agreed. The qualities that made Rausch a villain in the \"Love Island\" Villa were the same ones that led to success and stardom in the \"Traitors\" castle, where everyone has signed up for a game of paranoia and deception.\n\n\"Rob came in carrying a 'Love Island' reputation for manipulation layered over with charm, and 'The Traitors' is essentially a format where those two qualities stop being a liability and start being a competitive advantage,\" Evan Nierman, CEO of the global PR firm Red Banyan, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the season unfolded, Rausch's scene-stealing moves inspired flattering headlines and countless TikTok fancams set to songs like Saweetie's \"My Type,\" Kendrick Lamar's \"Like That,\" and Taylor Swift's \"Cancelled!\" On his own Instagram page, Rausch has flaunted brand partnerships with Sonic and Celsius, as well as his clothing brand, Creek Rat, to over 1.7 million followers.\n\nOut of \"Love Island\" infamy, a star was born. With the space to show more of his personality in a different context outside of a dating series, Nierman said \"The Traitors\" has given Rausch a \"multi-dimensional public profile.\"\n\n\"Viewers observe you problem-solving under pressure, forming real friendships, navigating betrayal, and handling the game's emotional weight in real time,\" he said. \"That's character evidence more persuasive than anything a publicist could engineer from the outside.\"\n\nSince the first US season debuted in 2023, \"The Traitors\" has become appointment TV for reality fans.\n\nJuliana Martins, celebrity publicist and Founder of Eleven11 Media Relations, said she's had requests coming in \"left and right\" from talent agents asking how they can get their clients cast on \"The Traitors.\"\n\n\"A show like this, from a publicity perspective, is phenomenal,\" Martins said. \"It's also so competitive to get on now because everybody wants it.\"\n\nBecause the game requires a certain amount of backstabbing and deception, even from the so-called Faithfuls — whose job it is to stay alive and sniff out the Traitors while voting to boot one player per episode — the show is high risk, high reward for those looking to reenter the news cycle.\n\n\"It really catapults reality stars into other opportunities,\" Martins explained. \"Dylan Efron, for example, reached a broader audience through 'Traitors,' and then he went on to do 'Dancing With the Stars.'\"\n\nEfron, previously best known as Zac Efron's younger brother, appeared on season three and — spoiler alert! — won the show with a small group of Faithfuls, including former \"Bachelorette\" Gabby Windey, who said appearing on \"The Traitors\" was \"the best thing I've done for my career.\"\n\nRob Mariano, aka \"Survivor\" legend Boston Rob, also starred on season three and parlayed his renewed visibility into a cohosting gig on the official \"Traitors\" podcast. He and Efron have transformed their in-castle \"bromance\" into a professional partnership.\n\n\"For legacy reality stars like Boston Rob, returning to a really popular series can reintroduce them to a new audience, new viewers, while also still re-engaging fans,\" Martins said. \"It can lead to future casting opportunities, brand partnerships, hosting gigs, and other opportunities that really contribute to their career longevity and their overall perception.\"\n\nPeter Weber, a former \"Bachelor\" star, received a hero's edit on season two thanks to his bold gameplay, keen instincts, and self-branding as the ultimate Faithful.\n\nMartins, who previously worked with Weber on the promotional campaign for his 2021 children's book and has advised him on other projects, attributed his success on \"The Traitors\" to the show's unique format.\n\n\"Most reality shows are built around a specific narrative framework. 'The Bachelor' centers on finding one true love, and because of that structure, that editing and the storytelling, they're designed to support that one core goal and theme, which I think limits how somebody can fully show their personality,\" Martins explained.\n\n\"In Peter Weber's case, viewers really saw qualities that have been a part of who he is, but weren't really highlighted on his original seasons of 'The Bachelorette' or 'The Bachelor,'\" Martins said. \"'The Traitors' gave audiences a fuller understanding of him, rather than redefining him.\"\n\nStill, that opportunity for a less restricted, more complex arc can be a double-edged sword (or, in the case of \"The Traitors,\" a double-edged dagger).\n\n\"The exposure can cut both ways,\" Martins said. \"The 'Traitors' format does leave very little room to hide.\"\n\nSeason four's resident \"Bachelor\" star is Colton Underwood, a former pro football player who had a tumultuous ride on the dating show. (His most famous scene involved him hopping a massive fence to escape the camera crew.)\n\nAfter coming out as gay in 2021, Underwood found himself back in the reality TV conversation with \"The Traitors. Though he was hoping to be cast as a Traitor, he was ultimately made a Faithful, , and his aggressive gameplay ultimately made him a target both in the castle and on social media. He flung out accusations and dominated the roundtable debates. After he rallied his castmates to erroneously banish Tiffany Mitchell, she wrote on X, \"It's actually fuck Colton Underwood and I said that shit.\"\n\nThough Underwood did accurately guess that \"Real Housewives\" alum Lisa Rinna was a Traitor, he did so in a memorable scene where he threatened to blackmail her in the game, detailing a plan to \"hold her hostage.\" This language prompted many viewers to recirculate stalking accusations from Underwood's ex-girlfriend, Cassie Randolph, who filed a restraining order against him in 2020. (She later dropped the order, and Underwood said at the time that he and Randolph \"were able to reach a private agreement.\")\n\nIf Underwood hoped to use \"The Traitors\" to recover or distract from his past, it backfired. Many viewers criticized his energy as off-putting, unlikable, and overconfident. The Cut published an article titled, \"Colton Underwood's Reality-TV Rebrand Isn't Going Very Well.\" Meanwhile, Rausch is the latest star of the publication's \"Dream Date\" series.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Underwood's representative said he had \"the best time\" on the show.\n\n\"Colton came into Traitors Season 4 as a fan of the franchise ready to play the game. Since leaving the castle, he has continued to expand his network and slate. His involvement in the show is one he's truly grateful for.\"\n\nHistorically, villains from other TV shows have fared well on \"The Traitors.\" Infamous \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was dubbed by The New York Times as \"the most hated man in America\" after a very public cheating scandal, but bumbled through \"The Traitors\" season three with little to no backlash.\n\n\"I was like, Tom Sandoval's here? Damn, this guy's still getting gigs? It's good controversy,\" Windey told Variety. \"And then who knew? He actually kind of redeemed himself — he was the village idiot.\"\n\nNierman also cited Phaedra Parks — who was fired from \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" in 2017 after admitting to spreading harmful rumors about a fellow Housewife — as a cast member who had a massive reputational shift after appearing on \"The Traitors.\" In a game that rewards wit and discernment, her snappy one-liners and cutting takedowns at the round table went viral, and the moments helped all be forgiven by viewers. Her return to \"Real Housewives\" was announced shortly thereafter.\n\nVanzil Burke, who was Parks' manager at the time, said the rumor-spreading scandal \"almost destroyed\" Parks' career, but her popularity on \"The Traitors\" reopened doors for her.\n\n\"It was needed for her professional career,\" Burke told Business Insider. \"I had no doubt that she would go in, read the room, and handle it.\"\n\nBeing a Traitor allowed Parks to play up her \"bad girl\" persona, Burke said, while also proving to viewers that she'd matured and mellowed since she last appeared onscreen.\n\nStill, as with every PR maneuver, one size doesn't fit all.\n\nRausch, Sandoval, and Parks read as authentic because they didn't try to hide their notoriety, turning their perceived flaws — cunning, cluelessness, and shady reads, respectively — into assets. On the flip side, Nierman said Underwood lacked humility and self-awareness.\n\n\"The foundational rule of reputation repair is showing people you understand why they distrust you,\" Nierman said. \"Colton walked into the castle and did the opposite by immediately positioning himself as the leader of the Faithfuls in a way that confirmed every instinct that viewers already had about his controlling tendencies.\"\n\n\"If the arc feels like a calculated PR move rather than genuine growth, then audiences will not only reject it but be even more against you,\" Nierman added.\n\nUltimately, the real winners of \"The Traitors\" aren't the players who go home with a portion of the prize pot (somewhere around $250,000, depending on their success in challenges). It's the players who emerge with the public's favor, a busy phone line, and maybe even a comeback story.",

    "fullText": "Jack Dorsey said he's still hiring for his fintech company Block — even after he just laid off 40% of its workforce.\n\nThe cofounder said during an earnings call on Thursday that he expects to bring in more senior AI engineering talent to the team. The company's stock was up nearly 23% after trading hours as of 7 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey said in a memo to employees that Block was cutting its head count from 10,000 people to \"just under 6,000.\" The reason, he said, was because AI is unlocking \"a new way of working\" with \"smaller and flatter teams.\"\n\n\"We're not making this decision because we're in trouble. Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving,\" Dorsey wrote in the memo. \"But something has changed.\"\n\nDorsey said in an earnings call on Thursday that AI tools have increased productivity at the company with a 40% increase in production code shipment per engineer since September.\n\n\"We've seen engineering work that would have taken weeks to complete be done by a small team in a fraction of the time with agentic coding tools,\" he said.\n\nDespite the layoffs, Dorsey said during the call that Block expects to invest in hiring.\n\n\"We see meaningful opportunity to invest in our people and invest in hiring, invest in retaining a world-class team to deliver for our customers; ultimately, we expect to hire some more senior AI engineering talent who will continue to level up our engineering and product capabilities,\" he said.\n\nDorsey and a spokesperson for Block did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAI's impact is being felt across industries and roles, as companies find ways to automate work. One study by Stanford University researchers found that early-career positions in fields such as software engineering and customer service are on the decline.\n\nSome workers have also said that their responsibilities have increased with AI. A software engineer told Business Insider that the simultaneous increase in productivity and workload is leading to \"AI fatigue.\"",

    "fullText": "Want to make big bucks in AI without a technical background? There still might be room for you.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a Thursday post on X that \"people who are not technical\" can work on developing artificial general intelligence — in research recruiting.\n\n\"We believe the best research teams are built through context, taste and a real feel for where the field is headed next; research recruiting is about finding people who will move the frontier forward, not just filling roles,\" Altman wrote.\n\nHe added that Tifa Chen, OpenAI's head of research recruiting, is \"looking for exceptional recruiters from non-traditional backgrounds, former founders especially.\"\n\n\"Taste\" generally refers to having proper, decisive, and well-supported takes on the direction in which projects should go. It's wading through AI slop and drivel to surface gems.\n\nIf you have good decision-making skills, or if you have the chops to call yourself a connoisseur of something, that could be proof of good taste.\n\nThe great taste debate has long been brewing in the AI sphere. It resurfaced after Y Combinator founder Paul Graham posted on X on February 14 about taste in AI.\n\n\"When anyone can make anything, the big differentiator is what you choose to make,\" Graham wrote.\n\nOpenAI's president, Greg Brockman, wrote on X several days later that \"taste is a new core skill.\"\n\nAfter these takes from AI's top dogs, memes on \"taste\" went viral on social media, as Business Insider's Henry Chandonnet reported — mostly because whether one has \"good taste\" or not is highly subjective.\n\nTo be sure, tech's takes on taste go even further back. Apple's Steve Jobs, for one, said in a 1995 CBS interview that making great products \"ultimately, it comes down to taste.\"\n\n\"Picasso had a saying: good artists copy, great artists steal. And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas,\" Jobs said. \"And I think part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.\"",

    "description": "Smart people in tech and VC say Jack Dorsey's Block layoffs are \"the canary in the coal mine\" when it comes to AI job cuts.",
    "fullText": "Jack Dorsey's announcement on Thursday that Block was slashing its workforce nearly in half sent shockwaves through the tech world.\n\nDorsey, Block's CEO and cofounder, said AI was rapidly changing work at the financial services company, which owns Square, Cash App, and Afterpay.\n\n\"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better,\" he said on Thursday's earnings call, shortly after the reduction in force was shared on X.\n\n\"I had two options: cut gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now,\" he wrote in a memo. \"I chose the latter.\"\n\nBlock's stock was up over 20% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Shares were down more than 16% in the last year as of market close on Thursday.\n\nLeaders in tech and venture capital quickly reacted to the news, with some saying it could be the first of what's to come as AI fundamentally transforms companies and the nature of work. Others were more skeptical of AI's role.\n\nHere's what smart people are saying about the job cuts at Block.\n\n\"This is the first AI cut,\" tech investor Balaji Srinivasan said on X. \"And it will send shockwaves.\"\n\nThe Silicon Valley venture capitalist said the Block cuts were a \"signal to everyone in tech: get good now. Become indispensable. Work nights and weekends. Learn the AI tools and raise your game. Or you might not make the cut, as an employee or as a company.\"\n\n\"Block is the canary in the coal mine,\" Aakash Gupta, host of \"The Growth Podcast,\" said on X. \"And they're not alone.\"\n\nGupta said Dorsey \"said the quiet part out loud: intelligence tools paired with smaller teams have already changed what it means to run a company.\"\n\n\"Block went from 10,000 to 6,000 while growing revenue and raising guidance. Every CEO running a company with more than a few thousand employees is doing this math tonight,\" he added. \"The canary just stopped singing.\"\n\nBen Carlson, a financial analyst and director at Ritholtz Wealth Management, expressed skepticism that the cuts were purely driven by AI innovation, sharing a chart that shows Block's share price is down sharply from its high point in 2021.\n\n\"Maybe Block laying off a ton of employees is a sign that AI is gonna destroy everything,\" he wrote on X. \"Or maybe the stock is down 80% from the highs and they overhired and AI is a convenient excuse.\"\n\nJason Calacanis, angel investor and co-host of the \"All-In\" podcast, praised Dorsey for the cuts.\n\n\"Leadership is hard, but this feels like (another) visionary move,\" he said on X. \"Have never sold a share, since being a private investor in square.\"\n\n\"Feels inevitable this is about to ripple through every public company,\" Jessica Verrilli, cofounder of VC firm Adverb Ventures, said on X. \"We've gotta find a way to make everyone an owner w/ some exposure to the upside as the # of employees falls off a cliff.\"\n\n\"Respect to @jack for doing the hard thing,\" Shaun Maguire, partner at Sequoia Capital, wrote on X. \"While doing it intentionally and owning the decision.\"\n\n\"Square is just the beginning,\" Clara Shih, a startup investor and senior advisor at Meta, said in an X post. \"Every CEO faces the same decision today that manufacturing CEOs did in 2000: do a big layoff or your competitor will, pass on cost savings to customers and investors, and beat you.\"\n\n\"In 2000, jobs were lost to Shenzhen. In 2026, jobs will be lost to AI,\" she added.\n\nMatt Shumer, an AI CEO who wrote the viral \"Something Big is Happening\" essay earlier this month, said this is \"one of the first major examples of AI driving layoffs, but certainly not the last.\"\n\n\"If you're saying 'this won't happen to me', re-evaluate your thoughts. Now,\" he said on X. \"It may be the most important thing you do.\"",

On this visit, he got Trump grinning ear to ear.\n\nIn a photo Mamdani posted on X, Trump beams while holding up mockups of the New York Daily News front page.\n\n\"I had a productive meeting with President Trump this afternoon,\" Mamdani wrote in the X post. \"I'm looking forward to building more housing in New York City.\"\n\nThe newspaper's headline was \"Trump to city: let's build,\" followed by the subheadline \"Backs New Era of Housing. Trump delivers 12,000+ homes, most since 1973.\"\n\nThe mockup was made in the same style as the infamous Daily News headline about President Gerald Ford in 1975: \"Ford to city: drop dead.\"\n\nSome people on X were amused by how the mayor managed to make Trump — his political antithesis — look so happy in a photo op.\n\nSo good. Forever will be baffled by how more people never figured out how to play Trump like a fiddle. pic.twitter.com/XvSAH7NkG5\n\nOne X user wrote: \"All those frothing 'Mr. Mamdani got elected with a lot of promises, now let's see how he plans to enact them' op-eds and he just figured out the infinite money glitch like two months into the job.\"\n\nIn another meme, captioned \"art of the deal\" — a reference to Trump's book — an X user weighed in on how Mamdani secured the release of a Columbia student from ICE detention and successfully pitched a housing development plan to Trump.\n\nart of the deal https://t.co/l7vcAuiR35 pic.twitter.com/a6lZNA89wz\n\nIn Mamdani's victory speech in November, he issued a four-word warning to Trump: \"Turn the volume up.\"\n\nTrump labeled the self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist New York mayor a \"communist\" throughout Mamdani's mayoral campaign run.\n\nBut the dynamic shifted after Mamdani was sworn into office in January.\n\nThe internet was similarly obsessed with Mamdani's first meeting with Trump in January, after which the president had only nice things to say about him.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Mamdani if he considers Trump a fascist, Trump interjected: \"That's OK, you can just say yes. It's easier than explaining it. I don't mind.\"\n\n\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" Trump told reporters during the meeting. \"He's going to surprise some conservative people, actually.\"\n\nTrump also praised him in his State of the Union address to Congress this week.\n\n\"The new communist mayor of New York City, I think he's a nice guy, actually,\" Trump said during his speech. \"I speak to him a lot.

    "title": "Jack Dorsey struck an 'empathetic' tone as he laid off nearly half of Block",
    "description": "The CEO's empathetic and transparent tone and a relatively generous layoff package, are gaining respect amid a 40% workforce reduction at Block.",
    "fullText": "The CEO of Block is striking a different tone as the company executes massive layoffs.\n\nJack Dorsey, who cofounded the company behind Square, Cash App, and Afterpay, announced on Thursday that the company will lay off more than 40% of its workforce. Dorsey said in his memo that \"intelligence tools\" have enabled \"a new way of working.\"\n\nBlock shares surged in after-hours trading, and so are fears that AI might quickly displace jobs, but the tone of Dorsey's layoff memo is also becoming a focal point on X, with some users praising his leadership.\n\nDorsey said that anyone laid off will receive 20 weeks of salary plus one week for every year of tenure, have equity vested through the end of May, six months of healthcare, be given their corporate devices, and an additional $5,000.\n\nThis offering differs from others in the tech space. For example, Amazon's severance package tied to layoffs in January included pay for 90 days and healthcare benefits that continue through the last day of the month when employment ends.\n\nOn top of that, Dorsey said that departing employees wouldn't \"just disappear\" from Slack and email, and would be given several hours to say goodbye.\n\n\"I had two options: cut gradually over months or years as this shift plays out, or be honest about where we are and act on it now. I chose the latter,\" wrote Dorsey. \"Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead.\"\n\n\"To those of you leaving…I'm grateful for you, and I'm sorry to put you through this. You built what this company is today,\" Dorsey added. \"That's a fact that I'll honor forever. This decision is not a reflection of what you contributed.\"\n\nMany large companies have made repeated layoffs over the years. Amazon, for example, has had consecutive years of layoffs since 2022, cutting around 27,000 corporate positions in 2023, a few smaller trims in the hundreds in 2024, limited to specific teams, and a reduction of about 14,000 corporate workers in October 2025. Block itself has had several rounds of smaller staff cuts over the last several years.\n\nThe apologetic tone of Dorsey's statement also stands in contrast to other memos that made recent headlines. That includes one from AT&T CEO John Stankey in August, which boiled down to get on board with his plan or leave. Alexandr Wang sent out a memo with a more forward-looking tone, which said that the company is still hiring and investing, while Meta's Superintelligence Labs division laid off 600 workers.\n\nBrooks Holtom, a professor of management at Georgetown University, told Business Insider that the tone of Dorsey's layoff memo was aligned with recommendations from good management research.\n\nHoltom pointed to the opening line — \"Today we're making one of the hardest decisions in the history of our company\" — as \"a good way to start,\" because it signals that \"this isn't easy.\" Holtom also said that the company \"cut right to the chase, which is best practice with bad news,\" before shifting to an explanation of what the cuts are meant to accomplish.\n\nHoltom said that Dorsey's message included \"sympathetic sentences or even paragraphs\" directed at departing employees.\n\nIn Holtom's opinion, the package for those leaving is also \"relatively generous, and the message is, 'We take responsibility. What we're doing is trying to position us for the future.'\"\n\n\"The tone of the message,\" said Holtom, \"Is empathetic.\"\n\nEven as Dorsey expressed regret for the laid-off workers, he underscored that the decision was not a response to deteriorating business conditions, writing, \"We're not making this decision because we're in trouble. Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow.\"\n\nFor some who are now out of a job, the message that the company is financially healthy might only sharpen questions about why the cuts were necessary.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Dorsey held a tense all-hands video call during which staffers added dozens of \"thumbs down\" emojis to the screen, The New York Times reported. He wore a black hat emblazoned with the word \"LOVE,\" the newspaper said, citing two employees who participated in the meeting.\n\nDuring the call, an employee questioned whether Dorsey's choice of headwear was appropriate as he moved to cut nearly half the company's workforce, the Times said.\n\nBlock's layoff comes at a time when white collar workers face a tough job market and the threat of AI. A recently viral report by Citrini Research projected a 2028 scenario in which AI replaced too many white-collar workers too quickly, triggering a widespread recession that ultimately led to the stagnation of AI due to a lack of financial resources.",

Fort Hancock is located on the US southern border.\n\nTop Democratic lawmakers in the House Transportation and Homeland Security committees said on Thursday evening that the incident had involved the Defense Department shooting down the Border Protection drone with a \"high-risk counter-unmanned aircraft system.\"\n\nThe term is often used to describe anti-drone lasers, but the lawmakers issuing the statement — Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, and Rep. André Carson of Indiana — did not specify the name of the system.\n\n\"We said months ago that the White House's decision to sidestep a bipartisan, tri-committee bill to appropriately train C-UAS operators and address the lack of coordination between the Pentagon, DHS, and the FAA was a short-sighted idea,\" the statement said. \"Now, we're seeing the result of its incompetence.\"\n\nIt's not immediately clear when the incident occurred, or if the airspace closure around Fort Hancock is directly related.\n\nThe previous airspace closure over El Paso, which The New York Times reported was prompted by the downing of a party balloon, had also involved the use of an anti-drone laser.\n\nThe FAA's restriction is scheduled to last until June 24, though it's unclear if the closure will remain for the full listed duration. The El Paso closure was initially scheduled to last 10 days, but was lifted after a few hours.\n\nFebruary 27, 2026: This story was updated to reflect a joint statement from the Pentagon and the US Customs and Border Patrol.",

His firm manages $223 billion.\n\nThis includes dealing with genuinely new situations and the ability to make \"subjective decisions regarding qualitative factors and exercise taste and discernment,\" he wrote.\n\nWhile AI may be able to generate hypotheses from historical patterns, Marks questioned whether its speculation about new things would be \"consistently superior to that of all humans.\"\n\n\"Because a lot of the investing process comes down to speculation, and because of AI's less-than-total reliability, I think it's unlikely that AI will be infallible as an investor,\" Marks wrote.\n\nHe sees one more crucial difference.\n\n\"AI doesn't have skin in the game,\" Marks wrote. \"It doesn't feel the weight of concentrated positions or the fear of capital loss.\"\n\nTop investors have an instinctive feel for risk, which plays a major role in their success, he added.\n\nIf widely available information can't deliver an edge, Marks wrote, investment superiority has to be found in judgment and qualitative assessment — including \"divining companies' futures.\"\n\n\"By definition, few people are highly superior at performing these non-quantitative tasks — put simply, few possess exceptional insight,\" he wrote.\n\nThat leaves room, in his view, for a subset of investors to stand apart.\n\n\"I believe there will continue to be human investors who are superior to AI, since I don't think AI will be able to do an unbeatable job of these things,\" Marks wrote.\n\nFor many investors, however, the bar is rising.\n\nMarks argues that the advantage many active managers once sought in timely, readily available data is disappearing.\n\nThe competitive pressure in investing is part of a broader shift he sees unfolding.\n\nIn December, he called the technology's employment outlook \"terrifying.\"\n\n\"I am enormously concerned about what will happen to the people whose jobs AI renders unnecessary, or who can't find jobs because of it,\" Marks wrote at the time.",

    "fullText": "Paramount-Skydance has emerged as the winner in a multi-round battle for the future of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNetflix backed out — and stands to pocket $2.8 billion in breakup fees — after the Larry and David Ellison-run company made a higher bid.\n\nHere's what smart people in business and politics are saying about the deal.\n\nThe cofounder of wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki, which manages $4 billion, joked about the economics of the deal on X. WBD owes Netflix nearly $3 billion in a breakup fee.\n\n\"Haha. They paid $110 billion. Netflix gets $2.8 billion. Zaslov laughing to the bank. Welcome to Hollywood kid,\" Gerber said of WBD CEO David Zaslav.\n\nOn Monday, Gerber posted that Paramount could \"way overpay\" for WBD, allowing Netflix to \"walk away with Billions and a huge win saddling paramount with losses forever.\"\n\nThe Wharton School assistant professor, who researches mergers and acquisitions, wrote in an X post that the deal gave Netflix a way out.\n\n\"What is surprising to me is the speed with which Netflix had pulled out, and I respect their choice not to pretend they're still in it and prolong the game,\" Nary wrote.\n\n\"If WBD had indications of Netflix losing their faith in the deal, the change in their tone towards Paramount, dialing back their expectations for the headline price - all of these make sense now,\" Nary added.\n\nThe Democratic senator opposed last year's Paramount-Skydance merger and has scrutinized the latest company deal.\n\nIn a statement, Warren raised questions about the White House's alignment with Paramount Skydance.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that he was staying out of the battle for WBD — and that both bidders had called him. He said the deal would go to the Department of Justice.\n\n\"A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. merger is an antitrust disaster threatening higher prices and fewer choices for American families,\" Warren said.\n\nShe added, \"A handful of Trump-aligned billionaires are trying to seize control of what you watch and charge you whatever price they want.\"\n\nThe lawmaker said, \"It'll be up to the American people to speak up and state attorneys general to enforce the law.\"\n\nOn Thursday, California's attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement that the transaction was \"not a done deal.\"\n\n\"The California Department of Justice has an open investigation, and we intend to be vigorous in our review,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are in Jordan for a visit centred on humanitarian work, but without any formal engagement with the country's senior royals.\n\nWhile the duke and duchess met health officials, aid partners, and young people at refugee initiatives, their trip has drawn attention for the absence of meetings with the Jordanian royals.\n\nThe involvement of British diplomats has also sparked debate about Prince Harry and Meghan's trip, adding a political undercurrent to what was otherwise a charity-focused tour.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have reportedly received a subdued reception during their brief visit to Jordan, with no formal engagement arranged between them and the country's senior royals.\n\nHarry and Meghan arrived in Amman late Tuesday and quickly began a packed schedule of humanitarian-focused appearances.\n\nTheir itinerary has included visits to local charities and health-related initiatives, as well as a gathering at the British Ambassador's residence attended by World Health Organization (WHO) representatives and embassy staff.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, the ambassador's involvement has prompted criticism in some quarters, given the couple's status as non-working royals.\n\nDespite Harry and Meghan's presence in Amman, local sources indicated that they were \"snubbed\" by the senior royals as \"there is no meeting scheduled between the Duke and Duchess [of Sussex] and the Jordanian Royal Family.\"\n\nThe only Jordanian royal the couple reportedly encountered was Princess Basma Bint Talal, an aunt of the King, during a visit connected to the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development.\n\nInstead of appearing alongside Harry and Meghan, Abdullah held talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and separately met WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\nOfficial photographs from those meetings did not include the Sussexes, even though their Archewell Foundation has partnered with the WHO.\n\nBritain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, visited Amman's Specialty Hospital and met medical evacuees from Gaza who are receiving treatment there pic.twitter.com/ljRBAfsGJG\n\n— Reuters (@Reuters) February 26, 2026\n\nObservers have speculated whether the absence of a royal welcome reflects scheduling conflicts or a more deliberate distancing.\n\nSome royal commentators suggest that, given the close relationship between the Jordanian and British royal households, dating back to the friendship between the late Queen Elizabeth II and King Hussein, a formal audience might have been expected.\n\nOne royal insider said Harry and Meghan may be \"disappointed\" not to have been able to meet the King or Crown Prince of Jordan.\n\n\"It's a pseudo royal visit, mimicking many of the things they or William and Kate would have done when they were part of the Firm, but it seems to be lacking in the ceremonial side of things,\" the source said, per the Daily Mail.\n\nJordan's King, King Abdullah II, maintains longstanding ties with the British Royal Family.\n\nHe has shared warm public moments with King Charles III, including during an official visit to London last year. Abdullah and Queen Rania were prominent guests at the British coronation, where Queen Rania also met with Queen Camilla to discuss issues affecting women.\n\nThe Jordanian heir, Crown Prince Hussein, is also known to have a friendly rapport with Prince William.\n\nThe two have spent time together both in Jordan and the UK, including attending a World Cup match and carrying out a joint visit to RAF Benson. William and Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales, were also guests at Hussein's 2023 wedding.\n\nWhile the Sussexes were not received by Jordan's senior royals, they were greeted by British diplomatic staff upon arrival.\n\nThat involvement has drawn criticism from former Conservative minister Tim Loughton, who questioned the appropriateness of hosting the couple at the British Ambassador's official residence.\n\nLoughton said he found it surprising that Ambassador Philip Hall had extended such a formal reception, particularly given the Duke and Duchess's decision to step back from royal duties and present themselves as private citizens.\n\nHall reportedly expressed his appreciation for their visit during a roundtable event that included representatives from the United Nations and the World Health Organization.\n\n\"Your visit, your support, your appreciation of the efforts that the United Nations, including, of course, the World Health Organization, the government of Jordan, and others, are making here is enormously appreciated,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, Loughton explained that Harry and Meghan \"are not working royals and do not represent the British Government or UK PLC.\"\n\nHe added, \"Given their capacity to say unhelpful things which border on political, giving them an official platform could be construed as them saying something that represents official UK policy.\"\n\nBeyond the diplomatic discussions, Harry and Meghan focused their visit on humanitarian outreach.\n\nAt the invitation of Dr. Tedros, they met health officials and aid partners before travelling north to Za'atari Refugee Camp, one of the region's largest settlements for displaced families.\n\nThere, they toured a youth centre run by Questscope, which provides art, music, and sports programmes aimed at supporting young people's wellbeing.\n\nThe couple joined children in a football match, observed music sessions featuring traditional Arabic instruments, and met teenagers taking part in creative workshops designed to offer both education and psychosocial support.\n\nTheir programme also includes meetings with health and humanitarian teams coordinating relief efforts across the region.",

    "description": "\"It was very dark and murky.\"",
    "fullText": "Officials in South Texas have raised concerns after discovering that Tesla has been discharging treated wastewater from its lithium refinery into a local drainage ditch without notifying the district that maintains it.\n\nAccording to KRIS 6 News, Tesla holds a state-issued permit allowing it to discharge up to 231,000 gallons of treated wastewater per day into an unnamed ditch that eventually flows into Petronila Creek.\n\nBut drainage district officials said they were never notified that a pipeline had been installed across their easement. When workers encountered the discharge, they were alarmed by what they saw.\n\n\"It was very dark and murky,\" drainage district consultant Steve Ray said. \"I would say it was actually black. We're used to seeing good running water, and so we didn't know exactly what it was.\"\n\nThe lithium refinery, which began operations in December 2024, produces battery-grade lithium for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nWhile Tesla's permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality allows wastewater discharge, it specifically notes that it does not grant the right to use private or public property for conveyance.\n\nPetronila Creek flows into Baffin Bay, a sensitive coastal ecosystem that supports tourism and local livelihoods.\n\nIf large volumes of water — even treated water — were to overwhelm the ditch or carry unexpected pollutants downstream, it could threaten water quality and wildlife.\n\nBeyond environmental questions, this situation may raise concerns for customers. Tesla has previously faced scrutiny over product reliability and transparency.\n\nFor example, a class action lawsuit alleged that electronically actuated door handles on certain 2014-16 Model S vehicles \"routinely fail,\" leaving some owners unable to enter their cars without climbing through another door.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla sales in the United Kingdom dropped more than 57% year over year in January as competitors gained ground.\n\nWhile the company has helped accelerate the shift to electric vehicles, public trust plays a key role in continued growth.\n\nDrainage district officials said Tesla has been responsive since concerns were raised, and both parties are scheduled to meet to coordinate next steps.\n\nFor residents, staying informed about local water management meetings and environmental oversight can help ensure transparency.\n\nFor drivers considering an electric vehicle, it's worth remembering that the broader EV market includes many options beyond one brand.\n\nAs the drainage district works to clarify what's flowing through its ditches, officials say their focus is simple: protecting the community and the waterways that support it.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Oli Fox from indie band Good Neighbours, plus the BBC readers and AI with his predictions for this weekend's Premier League fixtures.",
    "fullText": "AI is still leading the BBC Sport predictions table, but could Albert Einstein be the unlikely inspiration to help Chris Sutton hit back this week?\n\n\"Einstein used to live in a hut across the field from my house,\" said BBC Sport football expert Sutton. \"He would have gone for a walk in my garden, I'm sure, so I'm literally following in his footsteps most days.\n\n\"I don't know what he was like at predicting football results, but that kind of genius rubs off, even years later.\n\n\"So, AI should beware - for this week's predictions I've been gazing at where his hut used to be and thinking 'what would Albert do?'\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 28 is Oli Fox from indie band Good Neighbours, who supports West Ham.\n\nAn expanded version of Good Neighbours' debut album, Blue Sky Mentality (Complete Edition), is out now.\n\nDo you agree with their predictions? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nOli is the younger brother of Wigan's former Wales Under-21s defender Morgan Fox, and his early dreams were to follow him into the professional game.\n\nHe told BBC Sport: \"I played a bit myself growing up, and had trials here and there, but I was never as close as my brother to being a pro - so I sacked it off pretty quickly.\n\n\"I don't think I'll get away with saying I was better than him. Morgan always had the natural ability when we were kids, even at the age of four or five, and he was scouted by Ipswich by the age of seven.\n\n\"Our dad's Welsh so he was very proud when Morgan played for their under-21s. He got called up for the senior team as well, against Turkey, which was awesome. That was a fun away day.\n\n\"It's been awesome going to watch him down the years - even when I am away on tour I get a link to tune in wherever I am in the world. I've not really missed a game, visually anyway.\n\n\"It's been harder for him to come and watch me, but we had our first UK tour in more than a year the other week, and he came to see me in Manchester. That was brilliant too.\"\n\nThe pair have both featured in the past two editions of best-selling video game EA FC - Good Neighbours songs are on the soundtrack of EA FC 25 and 26, while Morgan is in both as a player.\n\n\"We grew up playing it, so that was really cool,\" Oli added.\n\nChris Sutton and Oli Fox were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nI keep hearing people say that, mathematically, Wolves still have a chance of staying up, but let me just tell them straight - there is no chance of that happening.\n\nThere is no doubt Wolves have improved under Rob Edwards, but this is still a game I'd expect Aston Villa to win.\n\nUnai Emery's side have slipped up a few times in recent weeks, however, and it has cost them.\n\nThey have only won one of their past four league games and I am a bit gutted they haven't managed a couple more wins to really be in the title race.\n\nEmery has always talked down their title hopes anyhow, and I understand why - he obviously doesn't truly believe they can do it - but until this blip in form they were in with a real shout.\n\nI still think they will have too much for Wolves, but they are going to have to work hard for the points. Villa won 1-0 at Villa Park earlier in the season, so I am going for the same scoreline here.\n\nOli's prediction: I don't think either team is in particularly fine form. Wolves don't have much to play for but they have got a few young players in the team now who are really good, and they can get a result here. 1-1\n\nSunderland just seem to be fading a little bit.\n\nThey went fourth in the table when they beat Bournemouth 3-2 at the Stadium of Light at the end of November, but their results have tailed off recently and they have missed Granit Xhaka's influence in recent weeks.\n\nXhaka came off the bench in last week's defeat by Fulham and, if he starts this time, they will be better organised here.\n\nI still fancy Bournemouth to win it, though. They always create chances and Rayan has done well since signing in January to replace Antoine Semenyo.\n\nOli's prediction: Bournemouth's front three is frightening and West Ham did well to keep them out last week. Sunderland don't really have the legs in midfield to cope. 3-1\n\nBurnley are still competitive, still scrapping and still picking up points. Their players are still playing for Scott Parker but, even so, it's still not going to be enough to keep them up.\n\nThe Clarets' draw at Chelsea last week was a good result and they could even have won that game, too, but they didn't. That lack of wins has been their problem all season, not their performances.\n\nThey have only won four of their 27 games so far and I think they are going to need to win five of their final 11 to stay up from here - and that's not going to happen.\n\nI don't think anyone saw Brentford's home defeat by Brighton coming last week - I didn't anyway - but I am still going to back them at Turf Moor.\n\nIt's going to be another tight one but I can see Igor Thiago getting back on the scoresheet with the winner. That's as exact as predictions can get.\n\nOli's prediction: I always kind of fancy Burnley to get something at home. Zian Flemming is in good form for them too. 2-2\n\nI keep hearing how West Ham have turned a corner, and they have improved recently, but I still thought last week's draw at home to Bournemouth was a poor result.\n\nThe Hammers were helped by Nottingham Forest and Tottenham both being beaten, but a win would have been massive for them.\n\nLiverpool were very unconvincing at Forest, but they did nick the win.\n\nSome of their fans are still whinging about Arne Slot and he is always being compared to Jurgen Klopp, but they are actually on a decent run of results and showing a bit of spirit too.\n\nThey are right in the mix for the top four but now they need to keep winning - I expect them to do that on Saturday.\n\nOli on why he's a West Ham fan: All my family are from East Ham and Upton Park. They grew up watching them, so when I was a kid I didn't really have a choice. I wouldn't have it any other way, though - I love them to bits.\n\nOli's prediction: The sensible prediction here is that Liverpool will win but I am not going with that. Instead, we will score inside the first 10 minutes because we always start well, but they will come back and then we will be fighting for an equaliser. I am not too hopeful, but I am going to say we will get one. 2-2\n\nWill West Ham stay up? The end of last season and the beginning of this one have probably been the toughest times to be a West Ham fan, because of what was happening at the club from the top down - it kind of felt like a wasted effort to try and support them.\n\nBut I feel like good things are on the horizon for us now - it feels like there is more camaraderie within the team, and they are starting to get Nuno Espirito Santo's methods more. Axel Disasi coming in has been game-changing too, when I didn't think he would have that effect.\n\nWe've found another gear now and obviously Crysencio Summerville's form has been excellent with Mateus Fernandes, but Tomas Soucek has been really key as well. I am feeling optimistic, because we've got a bit of grit.\n\nEverton's inconsistency makes them an absolute nightmare to predict, and the fact their away form is much better than their home results doesn't help me much here either.\n\nAnthony Gordon looks sharp as anything up front for Newcastle, with Nick Woltemade playing just in behind.\n\nThe Magpies won 4-1 at Hill Dickinson Stadium in November and I'd usually back them in this kind of game at St James' Park and be quite confident they would win.\n\nBut Everton won here last season and, given how good they are on the road, I just have a sneaky feeling they will get something this time too.\n\nOli's prediction: Everton had a few good chances against Manchester United but they just don't have that end product. Newcastle are at home so I've got to go with them. 2-0\n\nThis will be a great game. I was at Etihad Stadium when these two teams met in November, and it was a real turning point in Leeds' season.\n\nCity were 2-0 up at half-time but Leeds boss Daniel Farke put Dominic Calvert-Lewin on and had a real go.\n\nThey fought back to 2-2, and although they still lost to a last-gasp Phil Foden goal, that performance transformed them - they've been a different team in recent weeks compared with the way they started the season.\n\nThis is the sort of game where, if you are a City fan, you are thinking we have to go to Elland Road and win if we are going to win the title.\n\nLeaders Arsenal did exactly that a few weeks ago, and blew Leeds away.\n\nCan City do the same? I am not sure - especially if we class this Saturday evening kick-off as a night game, because Leeds' record in those under Farke is extraordinary - out of 21 so far, they have won 18 and drawn three.\n\nIt's hard to call, so this was one of the games I mentioned earlier where I was thinking, 'What would Einstein say?'.\n\nHe was better at physics than he was at predictions but I reckon he would have calculated that the floodlights will inspire Leeds again - but City will still come out on top.\n\nSo, my theory is that City will win. They don't have the same control in midfield any more, but they have so much firepower - as well as Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush and Semenyo are both in good form.\n\nHaaland is not exactly playing a different role now, but he is showing what an intelligent footballer he is. I don't see Leeds keeping them out.\n\nOli's prediction: This should be a simple game for City, but Leeds at home is never straightforward. Elland Road is like a fortress and Leeds have got goals in them so I can see this being a bit of a scrap. 2-3\n\nBrighton badly needed last week's win over Brentford, just to settle things down under Fabian Hurzeler. There had been a lot of talk about his future while they were on a poor run.\n\nNottingham Forest did not deserve to lose against Liverpool last week but scoring goals is still a problem for them, and I feel like it could haunt them again here.\n\nOli's prediction: I obviously hope Forest lose from a West Ham point of view but I'd take a draw here because you never know what you will get from Brighton. 1-1\n\nThe Tudor times have not started well for Tottenham under Igor Tudor.\n\nIt's been a classic case of a manager coming in and being bullish in his first press conference, saying he is 100% sure they will stay up - then losing his first game and letting loose on the previous manager, saying things like the players aren't fit.\n\nI thought it was an astonishing attack on Thomas Frank, because by saying Spurs' players are \"a good group with bad habits\", Tudor is totally blaming him for everything.\n\nWe know Tudor is a short-term specialist but what does that actually mean about him as a manager? It is OK going in and shoring clubs up for a few games, but why does he keep losing his job after that?\n\nI don't think this is an easy game for him after his side were outclassed in the north London derby.\n\nFulham won well at Sunderland last time out and they look full of confidence. Their home record is good and they've already beaten Spurs once this season - there's a good chance they will beat them again.\n\nOli's prediction: Fulham will take this, 100%. That would be great if it happens. 3-1\n\nManchester United have been very good under Michael Carrick and they are a team full of confidence - the way Benjamin Sesko is playing when he comes on is a great example of that.\n\nPalace picked up a late win over Wolves last time out but it still feels like their manager Oliver Glasner should have left by now, because there is such a negative atmosphere around the whole club.\n\nI don't like to question anyone's commitment but, in this scenario, I think you have no choice. Glasner wants to leave, and the whole situation has been handled very badly.\n\nPalace have won away at Manchester United in the past two seasons but, the way things are going for both teams, you'd only ever go for a home win here.\n\nOli's prediction: The way United are playing, I can see them scoring a few. 3-0\n\nArsenal have got to be careful they don't warm up in the Chelsea half again, for starters. If I was playing in this game, I'd do it deliberately!\n\nIn terms of the game, I can't see anything other than a Gunners win.\n\nChelsea can cause Arsenal a few problems because they have got players who can hurt anyone but, at the other end, I don't see Liam Rosenior's side keeping a clean sheet.\n\nI liked the way Arsenal responded to their setback against Wolves by battering Spurs. Chelsea don't like them much either, but this is going to end up with the same result.\n\nOli's prediction: Off the top of my head I want to say 2-2 for this one, it just feels right - we are going to see a few goals. 2-2\n\nOli on Declan Rice: I loved watching Kaka in the Champions League when I was a kid and I always wanted to play like him. But being able to watch Rice from when he broke into West Ham's first team was incredible.\n\nI understood he had to leave to reach the heights he has done and even the way he went to Arsenal, he did it really well. He's up there with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard as one of the greatest all-round English midfielders, and to watch that as a West Ham fan, I am just so proud of him.\n\nThe outcome of week 27 went down to the final game, Manchester United's 2-1 win at Everton on Monday.\n\nChris wrongly predicted a 1-1 draw but his guest, Embrace bassist Steve Firth, correctly backed United to win 1-0 - and those 10 points handed him the weekly win.\n\nOverall, Chris got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, including one exact score, for a total of 80 points.\n\nThat was enough for him to beat the BBC readers, who got five correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 50 points, and also get the better of AI, which managed six correct results with no exact scores for 60 points.\n\nBut it was Firth who finished on top, with six correct results and one exact score, to end up on 90 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "In the future, Savannah fans of Buc-ee's will have a much shorter drive as the iconic chain plans a new store much closer than the Brunswick location.",
    "fullText": "Buc-ee's continues its expansion, with what will be the chain's fourth Georgia location in Monroe County. As of last fall, it's supposed to be complete by March 2027. But there's another fans in the south will want to keep an eye out for.\n\nA new Buc-ee's is planned for Hardeeville in Jasper County, about 25 minutes up I-95 from the Savannah area. It will occupy a 46-acre site within the larger Hardee Station development located at Exit 8 off I-95, at the intersection of U.S. Highway 278 and Highway 17.\n\nOnce completed, this would put it just 20-30 miles outside of the Savannah area, depending on where specifically you live. Currently, the nearest is in Brunswick, over 60 miles away.\n\nThe Hardeeville Buc-ee's location in Jasper County is expected to include dozens of fuel pumps and electric-vehicle charging stations, serving both traditional and eco-friendly travelers. Key features include a bicycle plaza and several scenic ponds that enhance the visitor experience, according to multiple media reports.\n\nConstruction on the new Buc-ee’s in Hardeeville is expected to begin in early 2026. Josh Gruber, Hardeeville city manager, said the town's goal is to meet residents' needs.\n\n\"Basically, what that means is, for a resident to be able to go to the grocery store, go out to eat, have retail recreation opportunities, can get all of those needs met, and do that within the city of Hardeeville, rather than having them have to get in a car and drive someplace else outside the city,\" Gruber said in an interview with media outlet WJCL.\n\nThe projected completion date is 2031, according to Buc-ee's.\n\nThe following Buc-ee's locations are set to open in 2026, according to USA TODAY.\n\nHuber Heights, Ohio, on April 6\n\nBenton, Arkansas, in late summer or early fall\n\nMurfreesboro, Tennessee, before the end of 2026\n\nThere are currently three open Georgia Buc-ee's in Brunswick, Calhoun, and Warner Robins. South Carolina has one in Florence.\n\nPay rates at Buc-ee's depend on the position. But cashiers, grocery associates, gift associates, and janitorial/cleaning and maintenance attendants all make $18.\n\nMeanwhile, deli/food service associates, bookkeepers, and grocery team leads make $21.

    "title": "Remote employees have quietly unlocked one major workplace perk: Getting paid 12% more than their in-office colleagues, Fed study finds",
    "description": "The biggest remote-work winners in France are already high-paid senior employees able to persuade their bosses to let them stay home, new research reveals.",
    "fullText": "At the end of last year, a Harvard University–led study revealed the lengths to which remote employees would go to continue working from the comfort of their home offices: Participants were, on average, willing to forgo 25% of their total compensation in order to have their identical job, except with partial or full remote work capabilities, instead of working in the office.\n\nWhat does research reveal about remote work's future?\n\nWhy do remote workers earn higher wages than office employees?\n\nWhat demographic factors explain the work-from-home wage premium?\n\nHow does employee seniority affect remote work opportunities?\n\nNew research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco suggests the opposite phenomenon is happening—at least for some workers. Employees working from home are actually getting paid more than their in-office colleagues.\n\nA recent study published by the San Francisco Fed analyzed data from nearly 25,000 French employees using the French Labor Force Survey, as well as firm-level data, and Social Security records to look at which jobs had flexible options, what they paid, as well as demographic information about the workers.\n\nResearchers found employees who work from home, at least some of the time, earned, on average, 12% higher hourly rates than those working fully in-person. About half of this boost was correlated with education levels, gender, and age, and when researchers controlled for these variables, they still saw about a 6% difference in wages, with remote employees still earning what researchers call a work-from-home wage premium.\n\nThe study noted both France and the U.S. have similar levels of employees working from home, and both countries have more remote work opportunities for higher-paying, better-educated employees.\n\n“Using French administrative data and controlling for a rich set of worker and firm characteristics, we find that workers who work from home earn higher hourly wages than those who do not,” researchers said.\n\nEven with the pandemic nearly six years in the rearview mirror, work-from-home debates have continued as large companies—including Stellantis and Home Depot just in the past month—asked workers to come back to the office five days a week. Nearly 65% of workers said their offices have some form of hybrid work, according to data from Zoom.\n\nThe trend of workplace flexibility appears to be here to stay: The National Bureau of Economic Research found millennials and Gen Z bosses are more likely to let employees work from home compared with bosses from older generations, creating an even greater imperative for future-of-work experts to better understand what makes it so compelling in an evolving workforce.\n\nTo be sure, remote employees are not magically getting paid more just because they clock in from home. The San Francisco Fed study noted nearly half of the 12% pay bump for hybrid workers was the result of certain demographic factors, such as age, gender, and how long someone has held their job position. Older workers with more senior titles, for example, were paid more.",

    "title": "The costliest error people make in their 60s has nothing to do with money—it’s overlooking these 11 warning signs",
    "description": "What you wave off now as normal will cost you everything in ten years.",
    "fullText": "I was sitting across from a man in his early sixties who kept talking about his retirement portfolio like it was the only thing holding his life together.\n\nWe were at a small dinner party. The kind where the wine is cheap but the conversations turn unexpectedly honest.\n\nHe listed percentages. Market shifts. Safe bets. He said the word “security” at least six times.\n\nBut when someone asked how he’d been sleeping, he laughed it off. Said he was “fine.”\n\nLater, when everyone else had drifted toward the dessert table, he admitted he hadn’t slept through the night in months. His chest felt tight in the mornings. He’d stopped calling old friends back. “It’s just stress,” he said. “It’ll pass.”\n\nIt didn’t look like stress. It looked like something deeper.\n\nThat was the first time I realized how many people in their 60s obsess over protecting their money. But the costliest error has nothing to do with finances. It’s overlooking these warning signs. Here’s what’s actually going on.\n\nThey used to wake up with energy. Now they wake up tired and assume it’s inevitable.\n\nSo they normalize it. They say, “Well, I’m not 30 anymore.” They shrug it off when their body feels heavier than it should.\n\nThey push through afternoons that feel foggy and slow.\n\nOf course, aging changes things. But there’s a difference between natural slowing and chronic depletion. Persistent fatigue in later adulthood often links back to untreated sleep disorders, depression, or underlying medical issues—not “just getting older.”\n\nWhen someone decides exhaustion is the price of turning 60, they stop investigating it. And sometimes what they’re dismissing is exactly what needs attention.\n\nIt doesn’t happen in an obvious way\n\nThey stop initiating plans. They cancel more often. They tell themselves they’re “just tired” or that everyone’s busy anyway. Over time, the invitations slow down.\n\nThis happened with my aunt. She used to host every single Easter, and then one day, just convinced herself that she was done. The effort wasn't worth it.\n\nBut long-term studies on aging and well-being consistently show that social connection is one of the strongest predictors of both mental and physical health in later life. Isolation doesn’t just feel lonely—it compounds stress and shortens resilience.\n\nPulling back may feel protective. It rarely is.\n\nForgetting where the keys are is normal. Forgetting familiar routes or repeating the same story multiple times in one evening can be different.\n\nMany people in their 60s were raised to power through discomfort. Admitting cognitive changes feels like admitting weakness. So they joke about it instead.\n\n“Senior moment,” they say, brushing it off.\n\nNeurologists often point out that early intervention matters far more than late-stage panic. Mild cognitive impairment, when caught early, can sometimes be slowed or managed. But that requires acknowledging it in the first place.\n\nPretending nothing is happening doesn’t stop it from happening.\n\nThe circle gets smaller. The routine tighter. The risks fewer.\n\nThey stop trying new restaurants. Stop traveling. Stop learning new technology because it feels frustrating. They tell themselves they’ve “done enough.”\n\nThere’s comfort in familiarity. But there’s also stagnation.\n\nLearning new skills, navigating new environments, even small changes in routine can help maintain cognitive flexibility.\n\nWhen someone’s world quietly narrows to the couch, the TV, and the same weekly errands, it doesn’t just limit experiences. It limits growth.\n\nI didn’t see this clearly until I watched a relative slowly stop doing the things that once animated him. It wasn’t age that dulled him. It was retreat.\n\nA sore knee becomes a permanent companion. Back pain becomes background noise. Instead of asking questions, they adapt around it.\n\nThey stop walking as far. Stop exercising altogether. Stop mentioning it at checkups because “it’s not that bad.”\n\nHere’s what often gets missed: untreated chronic pain doesn’t just affect mobility. It affects mood, sleep, and overall health. There’s a strong connection between persistent pain and increased risk of depression in older adults.\n\nPain that lingers is information. Ignoring it doesn’t make someone tough. It just delays relief.\n\n“Everyone slows down.” “Of course I’m not as excited about things.” “This is what 60 looks like.”\n\nSometimes it is. Sometimes it isn’t.\n\nDepression in older adults often looks different from how it looks in younger people. It can show up as irritability, loss of interest, sleep disruption, or unexplained physical complaints. And it’s frequently underdiagnosed because it hides behind the narrative of aging.\n\nMental health professionals have long noted that many people over 60 don’t label what they’re feeling as depression—they call it boredom, stress, or fatigue.\n\nIf joy has quietly drained from daily life and nothing feels particularly worth looking forward to, that’s not something to dismiss.\n\nThere’s a certain silence that creeps in during this decade.\n\nFear of illness. Fear of becoming dependent. Fear of irrelevance. Fear of running out of time.\n\nInstead of naming it, they focus on spreadsheets or house projects or reorganizing the garage. Anything measurable feels safer than admitting vulnerability.\n\nSaying the fear out loud can help it lose some of its grip. But many 60-year-olds never do. They carry it privately, which makes it heavier.\n\nAvoidance doesn’t eliminate fear. It just isolates it.\n\n“This year’s not the right year.”\n\n“After I hit this savings goal.”\n\nThe plans stay theoretical. The trips remain bookmarked online. The hobbies wait for some undefined future window.\n\nAs people age, they become more aware of time’s limits, yet paradoxically, some still delay meaningful action. It’s a strange human contradiction.\n\nI’ve caught myself doing this in smaller ways—waiting for a perfect moment that never actually arrives. In your 60s, that waiting becomes more consequential.\n\nMoney can grow. Markets can recover.\n\nBut overlooking the signals your body, mind, and relationships are sending you? That’s a different kind of loss.\n\nThe costliest mistake in this decade isn’t financial miscalculation. It’s assuming you have unlimited time to address what’s quietly asking for your attention.\n\nLong marriages grow quieter. Friendships shift. Adult children get busy.\n\nInstead of examining what feels off, they tell themselves this is simply what long-term relationships become.\n\nLess affectionate. Less curious. Less engaged.\n\nThey stop asking questions they once would have asked. They stop reaching across emotional distance because it feels awkward to start again.\n\nBut emotional drift is not inevitable.\n\nWhen resentment goes unspoken or loneliness inside a partnership is brushed aside, it hardens. What could have been a conversation becomes a permanent gap. Over time, people begin living beside each other instead of with each other.\n\nIt’s a subtle cost. Shared meals without connection. Evenings spent in separate rooms. A quiet sense of being unseen that grows heavier each year.\n\nAssuming “this is just marriage at our age” can prevent people from repairing what is still repairable.\n\nRetirement arrives. Careers wind down. The role that once structured their days disappears.\n\nAt first, the freedom feels earned. There’s relief in not answering to anyone. But after the novelty fades, something else can settle in—a question they don’t quite want to ask: *Who am I now?*\n\nRather than naming that emptiness, they fill the calendar with errands. They stay busy without feeling engaged. They tell themselves they should be grateful, so they push away the discomfort.\n\nPurpose doesn’t vanish with a paycheck. But it does need to be redefined.\n\nWhen people ignore that internal shift, they can start feeling invisible to themselves. Days blur together. Motivation dips. Small frustrations feel outsized because there’s nothing anchoring them.\n\nPurpose in this decade may look different—mentoring, volunteering, creating, learning—but pretending it doesn’t matter is often more damaging than financial missteps. A well-funded life without meaning still feels hollow.\n\nThere’s a particular confidence that can set in during the 60s. If nothing hurts sharply and nothing feels urgent, they assume everything is stable.\n\nMy father kept postponing a routine checkup because he felt perfectly healthy. He walked every morning. Ate reasonably well. “Why go looking for trouble?” he’d say. By the time he finally went in, what could have been simple had become complicated.\n\nThat’s how it happens. Appointments get postponed. Screenings are delayed. Follow-ups feel optional. It’s easier not to go searching for problems.\n\nBut many serious conditions develop quietly. High blood pressure doesn’t announce itself loudly. Early-stage illness often whispers before it shouts.\n\nThe danger isn’t overt neglect. It’s the slow habit of postponing attention.\n\nPreventive care isn’t about expecting the worst. It’s about respecting the body enough to check in with it. Feeling fine in the moment doesn’t always mean everything underneath is fine.",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — The U.S. State Department said Thursday that it would pay up to $10 million for information leading to the arrests or convictions of two brothers identified as leaders of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel in the state of Baja California, which includes Tijuana.\n\nThe reward offer came the same day that authorities announced a new indictment against Rene Arzate Garcia, 42, known as “La Rana\" (\"The Frog\"). He was initially charged with drug crimes in San Diego. The superseding indictment includes charges of conspiracy, narcoterrorism and material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization.\n\nThe U. S. is offering $5 million each for information on Rene Arzate Garcia and Alfonso Arzate Garcia, 52, known as “Aquiles” (\"Achilles\"). Their whereabouts are unknown.\n\n“As controllers of a critical trafficking node in Tijuana at the U.S. border, the Arzate-Garcia brothers have become key essential components of the cartel’s command-and-control structure,” the State Department said. “Their control of the Tijuana Plaza offers the Sinaloa Cartel a tactical advantage in maintaining dominance over rival organizations, ensuring no interruption to the busiest border crossing in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nCalifornia's border with Mexico has been a battleground between the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels.\n\nThe rewards were announced four days after the Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, “El Mencho,” decapitating what had become Mexico’s most powerful cartel. The drug lord was the Mexican government’s biggest prize yet to show the Trump administration in its efforts to crack down on the cartels.",

    "fullText": "Texas Game Wardens have a warning for anyone using who goes out on lakes and rivers around the state. Failing to properly clean boats and equipment can spread invasive species -- and lead to citations.\n\nThat's because not cleaning can lead to the spread of invasive plants.\n\nAccording to Texas Game Wardens, certain invasive plants can cover lakes, block sunlight and oxygen, and destroy aquatic life below the surface. Officials say the species can spread quickly when boaters don’t properly clean, drain and dry their boats and gear after visiting an infested waterbody.\n\nThe warning comes after game wardens say they cited a duck hunter recently on Bois d’Arc Lake after an invasive plant was attached to his trailer. Officials say the hunter had previously launched a boat on an infected lake and, as a result, brought the giant salvinia and water hyacinth to Bois d’Arc Lake.\n\nMembers of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Inland Fisheries Department spent time on the lake collecting the invasive plants to try to prevent them from becoming established.\n\nOfficials say these invasive species can grow quickly under ideal conditions. One acre of giant salvinia can double to two acres in just a single week, Texas Game Wardens say.\n\nAccording to Texas Parks and Wildlife, giant salvinia is a floating fern native to southern Brazil and one of the problematic plants in Texas.  TPWD says it damages aquatic ecosystems by outgrowing and replacing plants that are native to Texas that help the environment.  You can read more about giant salvinia here. Water hyacinth are native to South American and can form dense colonies in bodies of water that block sunlight and can also crowd out native species.\n\nGot a news tip or story idea?

    "fullText": "Instagram said Thursday it will start alerting parents if their kids repeatedly search for terms clearly associated with suicide or self-harm. The alerts will only go to parents who are enrolled in Instagram’s parental supervision program.\n\nInstagram says it already blocks such content from showing up in teen accounts’ search results and directs people to helplines instead.\n\nThe announcement comes as Meta is in the midst of two trials over harms to children. A trial underway in Los Angeles questions whether Meta’s platforms deliberately addict and harm minors. Another, in New Mexico, seeks to determine whether Meta failed to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its platforms. Thousands of families — along with school districts and government entities — have sued Meta and other social media companies claiming they deliberately design their platforms to be addictive and fail to protect kids from content that can lead to depression, eating disorders and suicide.\n\nMeta executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg have disputed that the platforms cause addiction. During questioning by the plaintiff’s lawyer, in Los Angeles, Zuckerberg said he still agrees with a previous statement he made that the existing body of scientific work has not proved that social media causes mental health harms.\n\nThe alerts will be sent via email, text or WhatsApp, depending on the parent's contact information available, as well as a notification through the parent's Instagram account.\n\n“Our goal is to empower parents to step in if their teen’s searches suggest they may need support. We also want to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, which, if done too much, could make the notifications less useful overall,” Meta said in a blog post.\n\nJosh Golin, executive director of the nonprofit Fairplay, was skeptical of the new tool, saying Instagram “is clearly making this move now because the company is currently on trial in two different states for addicting and harming kids.”\n\n“Once again, Meta is shifting the burden to parents rather than fixing the dangerous flaws in how it designs its algorithms and platforms,” Golin said. “And all children deserve to be protected, regardless of whether their parents have enrolled in and utilize Meta’s supervision tools. If a product is not safe for teens to use without parental intervention, it shouldn’t be marketed to teens at all.”\n\nMeta said it is also working on similar notifications to parents about their kids' interactions with artificial intelligence.\n\n“These will notify parents if a teen attempts to engage in certain types of conversations related to suicide or self-harm with our AI,” Meta said. “This is important work and we’ll have more to share in the coming months.”",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Humans and Neanderthals cozied up from time to time when they lived in the same areas tens of thousands of years ago. But we don't know much about who got with whom, or why.\n\nA new genetic analysis offers some ancient gossip: The pairings were more often female humans with male Neanderthals.\n\nHow exactly this happened remains a huge question mark. Did human women venture into Neanderthal populations, or were the Neanderthal males drawn to larger human enclaves? Were these interactions peaceful, confusing, secretive or even violent?\n\n“I don’t know if we’ll ever get a definitive answer to how this happened, since we can’t travel back in time,” said population genetics expert Xinjun Zhang with the University of Michigan, commenting on the new analysis.\n\nBut the study, published Thursday in the journal Science, shows “that whenever Neanderthals and modern humans have mated, there has been a preference for male Neanderthals and female modern humans, as opposed to the other way around,” said author Alexander Platt, who studies genetics at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nScientists know that Neanderthals and humans mated because there is a small but important percentage of Neanderthal DNA in most modern humans outside of sub-Saharan Africa — including genes that can help us fight some diseases and make us more susceptible to others.\n\nBut they have also known that the Neanderthal DNA is not distributed evenly throughout the human genome.\n\nIn particular, there is a surprising lack of Neanderthal DNA in the human X chromosome, one of the bundles of genes in each cell known as a sex chromosome, compared with the amount of Neanderthal DNA in the other, non-sex chromosomes in the cell.\n\nScientists thought that maybe the genes in those locations were simply not beneficial — or even harmful. Perhaps people with those gene patterns didn’t survive as well so those genes were filtered out by evolution over time.\n\nOr, they thought, maybe the difference could be explained by how the two species intermingled.\n\nTo try to solve the riddle, Platt and colleagues looked instead at the Neanderthal genome and the human DNA that got interspersed during a “mating event” 250,000 years ago.\n\nWhen comparing these genes, they found more of a human fingerprint on the Neanderthal X chromosome — the same chromosome that, in humans, has less Neanderthal DNA than would be expected.\n\nThe most likely explanation for this mirror image pattern is mating behavior. That's because of the way sex chromosomes are passed from parents to children, explained Platt. Because genetic females have two X chromosomes and genetic males have one X and one Y chromosomes, two out of every three X chromosomes in a population, on average, are inherited from people’s mothers.\n\nIf more human females mated with Neanderthal males than the other way around, over thousands of years you would expect to see just what they found: more human DNA in Neanderthal X chromosomes and less Neanderthal DNA in human X chromosomes.\n\n“I think that they’ve taken some really important steps in filling missing pieces to the puzzle,” said Joshua Akey, who studies evolutionary genomics at Princeton University and wasn't involved with the new study.\n\nThe study can't totally rule out other explanations. For example, Zhang said, it’s possible that the offspring of human males and Neanderthal females just didn’t survive as well.\n\nBut the simplest and most likely, explanation, the study found, is also the most interesting: “It’s not the result of a strictly Darwinian survival of the fittest,” Platt said. “It’s really the result of how we interact with each other, and what our culture and society and behavior is like.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "Parking lots are designed for quick stops. Drivers pull in, grab groceries, load their trunks and head back on the road. But police are warning that the same spaces where motorists park their vehicles have quietly become a hunting ground for a new and aggressive scam.\n\nAuthorities in Charleston say criminals are targeting shoppers in grocery store parking lots with a deceptive scheme that can drain thousands of dollars from a victim’s bank account in seconds. The scam relies on pressure, sympathy and a portable payment device that turns what appears to be a small donation into a major financial loss.\n\nAccording to investigators, the suspects usually work in small groups and wait for drivers to return to their vehicles after shopping.\n\nAs motorists load groceries into their trunks or prepare to leave the parking lot, the group approaches and begins a conversation that often starts with a heartbreaking story.\n\nVictims report being told that the scammers are collecting donations for a funeral, a medical emergency, or another urgent cause. The story is designed to create emotional pressure. Shoppers are made to feel they are helping someone in distress and that even a small amount of money could make a difference.\n\nBut the scam quickly takes a different turn.\n\nWhen a person offers cash, the suspects decline and claim they can only accept digital payments. They then present a handheld card reader and ask the victim to tap their debit or credit card for what appears to be a quick donation. In reality, the amount being processed may be far higher than expected.\n\nPolice say some victims have reported losing thousands of dollars in a single transaction. In certain cases, losses have approached ten thousand dollars before the victim realizes what happened.\n\nInvestigators believe the scammers rely heavily on speed and confusion. Parking lots are busy environments where drivers are distracted by traffic, shopping carts and children. Criminals take advantage of those distractions to pressure victims into making a fast decision without carefully reviewing the payment.\n\nThe choice of location is also strategic. Grocery store parking areas are filled with vehicles coming and going throughout the day, which allows scammers to blend into the crowd. They can quickly move on to another shopper or leave the lot if anyone becomes suspicious.\n\nPolice say certain drivers appear to be targeted more often than others. Young mothers with children in shopping carts are frequently approached because scammers believe emotional appeals may be more effective in those situations. Victims sometimes feel pressured to comply simply to end the encounter and leave the area safely.\n\nThis story piqued our interest for several reasons, including the fact that the scam spotlights an often-overlooked aspect of automotive safety. Most people focus on avoiding theft or vehicle break ins while parked, but personal financial scams are increasingly becoming part of the risk landscape around busy parking areas.\n\nLaw enforcement officials recommend that motorists treat any unsolicited request for money in a parking lot with caution. Legitimate charities rarely collect donations in this manner, especially through handheld card readers operated by strangers.\n\nDrivers are encouraged to keep interactions brief, decline requests politely and leave the area if they feel pressured or uncomfortable. If suspicious activity is observed, police recommend reporting it so officers can investigate and warn other shoppers.\n\nIn today’s digital payment era, criminals are finding new ways to exploit convenience technology. A simple tap of a card that takes less than a second can authorize a large transaction, making it easier than ever for scammers to strike quickly.\n\nMotorists heading to the grocery store should keep in mind that the parking lot is not just where your trip begins and ends. It is also a place where awareness and caution can protect both your car and your wallet.\n\nNote: This article contains embedded video. Embedded media may not display on all platforms.

    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The chief federal judge for Minnesota issued a stern warning Thursday to the chief federal prosecutor for the state, as well as to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, warning them that they must comply with court orders or they risk criminal contempt charges.\n\nChief Judge Patrick Schiltz, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush and is seen as a conservative, took issue with an email he received Feb. 9 from U.S. Attorney Daniel Rosen, in which the prosecutor accused the judge of overstating the extent of ICE's noncompliance with court orders arising from the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown in Minnesota.\n\nHis order filed Thursday was just the latest in a series of critical and sometimes scathing statements and rulings by federal judges in Minnesota and elsewhere across the country against how the Trump administration has attempted to conduct mass deportations of immigrants, often citing violations of due process and standards for humane treatment.\n\nIn a filing by a different judge Thursday, Rosen, the head of his civil division and ICE representatives were ordered to appear for a contempt hearing Tuesday over failures to comply with court orders for the return of detainees' property.\n\nSchiltz had previously described ICE as a serial violator of court orders related to the enforcement surge. In a Jan. 28 order, he expressed “grave concerns” after federal judges in Minnesota identified 96 orders that ICE had violated in 74 cases. In Thursday's order, Schiltz said the government's response “was not to do a better job complying with court orders, but instead to attack the Court.”\n\nRosen told Schiltz his office's own review of a “statistically strong sample” of 12 of those 74 cases found a high compliance rate, and complained that the tally by the judges “was far beyond the pale of accuracy for an order that would be wielded so publicly and so sharply. The lawyers in my civil division didn’t deserve it.”\n\nSchiltz wrote in a new order that he filed Thursday that he then asked his judges and law clerks to review the numbers. While he said they discovered some mistakes, which cut both ways, they concluded that ICE violated 97 orders in 66 of the cases referred to in his earlier order.\n\n“Increasingly, this Court has had to resort to using the threat of civil contempt to force ICE to comply with orders,\" he wrote. \"The Court is not aware of another occasion in the history of the United States in which a federal court has had to threaten contempt — again and again and again — to force the United States government to comply with court orders.”\n\nThe chief judge also attached a list that documented 113 additional order violations in 77 additional cases, mostly since the original tally.\n\n“The judges of this District have been extraordinarily patient with the government attorneys, recognizing that they have been put in an impossible position by Rosen and his superiors in the Department of Justice,\" Schiltz wrote, noting the wave of resignations that has left Rosen's office shorthanded. \"What those attorneys ‘didn’t deserve’ was the Administration sending 3000 ICE agents to Minnesota to detain people without making any provision for handling the hundreds of lawsuits that were sure to follow.”\n\nNeither Rosen nor ICE officials immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nRosen acknowledged at a news conference Wednesday — his first since taking office in October — that his staff of prosecutors has fallen dramatically. He bristled when it was pointed out that at least two criminal cases have been dropped in recent days due in part to the losses. Rosen said the office had 64 assistant U.S. attorneys on the last day of his predecessor's term; 47 as of Rosen's first day; and was now down to 36. But he also insisted he was hiring new prosecutors at a “good clip” and that his office still has the capacity to prosecute major crimes.\n\nThe chief judge ended with a blunt warning:\n\n“This Court will continue to do whatever is required to protect the rule of law, including, if necessary, moving to the use of criminal contempt,\" he wrote. \"One way or another, ICE will comply with this Court’s orders.”",

    "fullText": "Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles is to his position what Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori is to his.\n\nBefore we cover the top players the Seattle Seahawks might take in the 2026 NFL Draft, let’s talk about one that can continue to push modern defense into the futuristic mold Mike Macdonald changed the NFL with- who will certainly be going far too high for the Super Bowl LX Champions to have any chance at.\n\nStyles is setting the NFL Scouting Combine on fire today. He just recorded the best vertical jump ever for a linebacker at 43.5” inches and the 4th-best broad jump ever at 11’2”. Watch the all-time explosiveness right here:\n\n.@OhioStateFB LB Sonny Styles putting up insane numbers already:\n- 11'2\" broad jump (T-4th all-time among LBs)\n- 43.5\" vertical jump (best all-time among LBs)\n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/3Nshgb2Dyb\n\nIf you’ve followed our coverage of Emmanwori over the past season, you might know that we constantly reference his combine testing numbers. He announced himself to the world one year ago at this event with the best measurables ever seen by a safety since testing began in 1987. The Seahawks traded up to draft him and he was a game changer for their defense, allowing them to defend both the pass and run in ways other teams simply couldn’t. He has as bright a future as arguably any defensive player in the league right now. The only reason he fell to the 35th pick was because of the idea that “he doesn’t play a premium position”.\n\nStyles can reinvent linebacker in the same way. He won’t fall in this draft, where he’s a consensus top 3-5 player, despite the same ideas about positional value. Whoever drafts him will also know that he’s more than just a linebacker. He played safety for his first two-years of college in 2022 and 2023, and was only moved to linebacker right before the 2024 season. To have started his career as a safety with this frame, though, is downright scary.\n\nSonny Styles \n6050\n244\n10 hand\n32 7/8 arm\n80 7/8 wing\n\n— Daniel Jeremiah (@MoveTheSticks) February 26, 2026\n\nWhen Styles’ full testing numbers come out later tonight, don’t be surprised if people start calling him the best player in the draft. Since I started writing this article, the Emmanwori comps are already flowing in. The linebackers are running the 40-yard dash now, and if Styles does as well as he’s projected, the hype will continue to flood the discourse even more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: NFL Combine: Sonny Styles is the Nick Emmanwori of linebackers",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers' quarterback situation entering the offseason is a tough thing to get a read on.\n\nAaron Rodgers is still looming as a choice, so too young Will Howard, with Mike McCarthy having a reputation for developing young quarterbacks.\n\nBut which avenue will the Steelers go down? They aren't likely to truly contend with either Rodgers or Howard, but we know that Rodgers has a ceiling. We know nothing about Howard, so why not try him out?\n\nWell, for ESPN's Seth Walder, his 2026 quarterback prediction for Pittsburgh will give fans something to think about -- he's gone with Rodgers.\n\n\"I don't think Rodgers' return is a foregone conclusion, but Mike McCarthy's introductory news conference pushed me to thinking it will happen,\" Walder wrote. \"But I suspect the Steelers won't have the appetite to rebuild or take a flier on an unknown QB. So they'll try to re-create the Packers of yesteryear, with Rodgers and McCarthy at the helm.\"\n\nMore:Chiefs' predicted QB starter for 2026 named and it's not Patrick Mahomes\n\nThere's no denying that Rodgers gives Pittsburgh the best chance to win, but he is likely a short-term option.\n\nAt 42, whether or not he goes around again in 2026 is unknown. But for Howard, he hasn't gotten his chance yet, so why not let McCarthy mold him into the quarterback he wants?\n\nI'm not sure how Steelers fans would feel about another go-around with Rodgers, especially after some of the offensive performances of last season. If Howard did that, fans would be more willing to look past it, at least initially.\n\nWhat Pittsburgh does is unknown, but I'm not sure going forward with Rodgers is the way to go.\n\nAnalyst offers horror 4-word prediction for Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs\n\nESPN offers harsh Shedeur Sanders' Browns reality in franchise's QB search\n\nBengals give stunning Trey Hendrickson future quote that fans will love\n\nMike Evans' agent drops huge update over Buccaneers future\n\nVikings oddly predicted to go after Pro Bowl QB in free agency\n\nRams named landing spot for rocket-arm QB\n\nBills' Joe Brady reiterates stellar Keon Coleman desire",

    "description": "Some NHL GMs are facing pressure before the trade deadline, whether they're chasing the Stanley Cup or building for the long-term. Who's feeling the heat?",
    "fullText": "The NHL is speeding toward its March 6 trade deadline, and there are more than a few GMs feeling a pressure change.\n\nSome, if not most, GMs are under pressure to either steer their team into a playoff position or become a Stanley Cup front-runner – and that could mean making a splash on the trade front.\n\nOther GMs, however, are under pressure to stock their team with enough young, dynamic talent to power them through the next decade or longer, and making the playoffs right now isn't a must for them.\n\nBut not every manager is under pressure right now. For instance, San Jose Sharks GM Mike Grier and Dallas Stars counterpart Jim Nill are not feeling any heat right now, even though their teams are in drastically different points in their respective competitive cycle.\n\nThat said, there's no shortage of GMs who are feeling the heat in one way or another. Here are our choices for the four NHL figures that are on this week's NHL Hot Seat Radar.\n\nThe Oilers went into the NHL's Olympic break on a three-game losing streak – and in their first game back Wednesday night, Edmonton completely collapsed after leading 4-2 and lost 6-5 to the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nBowman's big trade acquisition – veteran goalie Tristan Jarry – allowed five goals on 25 shots and was pulled in favor of Connor Ingram.\n\nThe Oilers have sunk to third place in the weak Pacific Division, and they're only four  points ahead of the ninth-place L.A. Kings. So the potential for disaster in Edmonton is very real.\n\nBowman has to not only stabilize his team but make sure they are still a legitimate Cup contender after losing in the Cup final in 2024 and 2025. It's not going to be easy, as Bowman has less than $13,000 in salary cap space to use at the deadline. He does have two of his first-round draft picks in the next three drafts, though.\n\nThe first task at hand is clearing Andrew Mangiapane's $3.6-million cap hit, but with 12 points in 50 games, there's no guarantee any other team wants him.\n\nBut really, standing pat can't be an option for Bowman. He is now under as much pressure as he's faced since taking on the Oilers job in 2024.\n\nNHL Rumor Roundup: Will The Oilers And Sharks Acquire A Defenseman? With the March 6 NHL trade deadline fast approaching, the Edmonton Oilers and San Jose Sharks are believed to be in the market for defensemen.\n\nThe Lightning are 9-1-0 in their last 10 games, they're in first place in the East, and they've got a few million in cap space to improve their lineup by the deadline.\n\nAs a two-time Cup-winner, BriseBois doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, and he can go into the trade deadline confident that he's fully secure in his duties. So his seat is definitely cold.\n\nWhat will BriseBois be looking for prior to the trade deadline? A veteran who can boost Tampa Bay's offense would be ideal, particularly in the bottom six. Perhaps reacquiring Calgary Flames forward Blake Coleman would interest BriseBois.\n\nThe Lightning have been so dominant this season, you could see why BriseBois might stick with the group that's got the team this far this season. But in a very competitive Atlantic Division, Tampa Bay needs all the firepower it can get.\n\nArmstrong had to be disappointed coming out of the Olympic break, missing out on the gold medal with Team Canada. But the much bigger disappointment this season has been the Blues.\n\nGiven that Armstrong will be passing over the Blues' GM role to former star left winger Alex Steen, you'd have to imagine Armstrong is feeling more heat to trade St. Louis' veteran players for draft picks and prospects in a process that will shorten their retool.\n\nThe Blues have a slew of players other teams would have great interest in, including goalie Jordan Binnington, center Brayden Schenn, defenseman Justin Faulk, right winger Jordan Kyrou and maybe Robert Thomas.\n\nWhile it's likely a long shot that Armstrong completely empties his shelves and strips the Blues down to the studs, there aren't many sellers this season, which is driving up the asking price he'll get from teams interested in his players.\n\nThe Blues have been through this type of transition multiple times under Armstrong's tenure. But this year feels very much like bigger changes are coming to St. Louis. If Armstrong plays his cards just right, he's got the chance to use trades to set up his franchise for a long time to come when he remains president of hockey operations.\n\nNHL Rumor Roundup: More Blues Trades Coming, Latest Maple Leafs Buzz The Blues' trade of Nick Bjugstad before the Olympic break could be the first of several moves by them before the trade deadline, while speculation is growing over which players the Toronto Maple Leafs could peddle.\n\nAt this time last year, the Flyers were about to trade off some of their veterans – including Scotl Laughton, Andrei Kuzmenko and Erik Johnson – for picks and prospects. But this season, there are fewer Flyers players who look destined to be moved the way Laughton was.\n\nThis year, the Flyers are in a position to add players, not get rid of them – although they've got a big chip to play in the form of veteran D-man Rasmus Ristolainen. If Briere can convert Ristolainen into a center, the Flyers will be thrilled at the trade-off. But centers aren't easy to find or acquire, so Briere's search may not bear the kind of fruit the organization is looking for.\n\nPhiladelphia will have a whopping $32.2 million in cap space at the trade deadline, so Briere will be able to absorb a contract or two if it means acquiring long-term help. It won't be the worst thing in the world if the Flyers fail to make the playoffs, but the heat on Briere right now is all about how he positions the team for improvement over the long haul. Because next season, missing the playoffs won't be as acceptable.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – Suns owner Mat Ishbia made an appearance on ESPN’s “The Pat McAfee Show” on Wednesday and shared several bold ideas aimed at revitalizing NBA All-Star Weekend, which will be hosted in Phoenix in 2027.\n\nWith criticism mounting over the competitiveness and entertainment value of recent All-Star festivities, Ishbia and McAfee proposed a total $4 million incentive to restore prestige to two of the league’s most iconic events.\n\nThe idea seemed to stem from McAfee.\n\n“Let’s announce right now what we’re doing for the slam dunk contest,” McAfee said during the show. “You’re going to put a million dollars up for the winner and a million-dollar donation to the charity of their choice.”\n\nMcAfee also added the same prize would apply for the winner of the 3-point contest, bringing the total commitment to $4 million.\n\n“Done,” he responded immediately.\n\nWhile $4 million is no small pledge, even for an NBA owner and CEO of a major mortgage company, Ishbia expressed confidence that NBA commissioner Adam Silver would support the initiative. The proposal signals a willingness from NBA executives to directly address growing concerns that All-Star Weekend has lost its competitive edge.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Ishbia and McAfee will follow through on the proposal, but the urgency behind it is clear: the All-Star dunk contest has drifted toward irrelevance in recent years.\n\nThere was a time when the dunk contest defined All-Star Saturday night. Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins turned it into must-see television in the 1980s. Vince Carter’s 2000 performance remains one of the most iconic moments in NBA history. Even in the 2010s, Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon reignited excitement with an all-time show.\n\nRecently, however, most of the league’s biggest names have opted out of the event, leaving the spotlight to lesser-known players and less viewership of the event. The absence of established stars has been a recurring criticism.\n\nESPN personality Stephen A. Smith put the blame on LeBron James’ lack of participation in the 2026 contest, saying “we all know it was terrible because there was no star power,” while Shaquille O’Neal called this year’s performance “the worst dunk contest in NBA history.”\n\nThe NBA has no shortage of athletic ability. Today’s players are arguably more explosive than ever. Instead, the issue centers on participation. Established superstars often sit out of the contest for fear of injuries before the playoffs and a lack of financial incentive to compete.\n\nIshbia is confident the new incentive will attract some more big names to compete in the contests next year.\n\n“Let’s get the best guys in it,” Ishbia said. “Let’s make it awesome.”\n\nBeyond the contests, Ishbia is focused on elevating the overall fan experience as Phoenix prepares to host All-Star Weekend in 2027.\n\nThe CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage joined the action this year, suiting up for the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in Los Angeles. Next year, his presence will shift as a host rather than participant, helping shape the weekend’s structure.\n\n“I have a say in how to make it great … how do we get great players in it, how do we make it a great event, how to make the fan experience phenomenal,” Ishbia said. “We’re going to make it an amazing event.”\n\nFor the NBA, the stakes are significant. All-Star Weekend remains one of the league’s premier global showcases. Television ratings, social media engagement and sponsorship activations all hinge on delivering compelling content. If more star-studded names appear in the festivities, the ripple effect could extend well beyond one weekend.\n\nWhether Ishbia and McAfee’s bold pledge becomes reality is to be determined, but in a league driven by entertainment value, the Suns owner’s willingness to invest directly in the initiative sends a clear message: If NBA All-Star Weekend is going to thrive in Phoenix, it will not be for lack of effort – or funding.\n\nThis article first appeared on Cronkite News and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.",

    "description": "the 2025 NFLPA report cards have been revealed and the Bears have some interesting grades.",
    "fullText": "The NFLPA may not be allowed to publish their annual team report cards anymore, but that didn't stop the grades from getting out for every NFL team, including the Chicago Bears. Kalyn Kahler of ESPN obtained the report cards from the NFLPA for all 32 teams, and the Bears earned some high marks in some areas, as well as a few lower grades in others.\n\nThis is the fourth season in which the NFLPA has dished out grades for each team with reviews from players, but it's the first year the full results aren't available to the public. Nevertheless, Kahler was still able to get each letter grade for the different areas of review. These include facilities, training staff, nutrition, coaching staff, front office, and more. Below is how the Bears graded out in each of their areas:\n\nOverall, the Bears finished 13th overall, one place higher than last year's ranking. Their biggest gain, unsurprisingly, was at head coach with the arrival of Ben Johnson. He earned an A for his job helping lead the Bears to an 11-6 record to capture the NFC North division title. A year ago, the combination of Matt Eberflus and Thomas Brown earned a C. Another big improvement was the food and dining, which improved to a B grade after getting a C+ a year ago.\n\nOther notable areas included an A- grade for offensive coordinator Declan Doyle, who has since taken the same role with the Baltimore Ravens. It seems Doyle made a strong first impression as an offensive coordinator despite being just 29 years old at the time. Meanwhile, defensive coordinator Dennis Allen earned a C+, even though he had his unit taking the ball away at a staggering rate.\n\nFinally, the Bears remained consistent in a number of areas compared to last year's results. Players seem to like the weight room and locker room, while George McCaskey earned an A- for the second year in a row. Their treatment of families can still be improved, however, which received a C+ for the second year in a row.\n\nAlthough we won't get the full breakdown regarding the results like in years past, it's good to know the Bears are still near the top of the league in most categories according to the players. And they improved in the most important areas as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears earn mixed grades on NFLPA 2025 report card",

    "description": "Journalist Dave Meltzer speculates on the recovery timeline for Bronson Reed after he sustained a torn bicep on \"WWE Raw\" this week.",
    "fullText": "After sustaining a distal biceps tear on \"WWE Raw\" this week, The Vision's Bronson Reed reportedly headed to Birmingham, Alabama with the expectation that he'd undergo surgery to repair it. The timeline for his subsequent recovery, meanwhile, has been relatively vague, with \"Raw\" commentator Michael Cole simply noting that Reed would be out of action \"indefinitely.\"\n\nOn \"Wrestling Observer Radio,\" journalist Dave Meltzer speculated in more specific terms. \"Nothing more [on updates], but if he does have surgery, which I presume he's getting, six or seven months out, generally,\" Meltzer said. \"So it's a long time out. If he went to rehab it without surgery, he probably could have made it back in four [months]. But yeah, from what I gather, he's getting surgery.\"\n\nReed's bicep tear occurred in the midst of his Men's Elimination Chamber qualifying match against Jey Uso and the original El Grande Americano (Chad Gable) on \"Raw.\" WWE reportedly penciled in Reed as the original winner of the qualifier, but due to his mid-match injury, Uso won instead and will now compete in the Elimination Chamber at the titular premium live event on February 28. Before injury, Reed was reportedly factored into WrestleMania 42 plans as well. Whether or not that will stay true has yet to be seen.\n\n\"The Tribal Thief\" is not the only Vision member sidelined with an injury right now as Bron Breakker continues to recover from a hernia that required surgery earlier this month. Elsewhere, The Vision's former leader Seth Rollins remains on the shelf with a shoulder injury he sustained at WWE Crown Jewel in October.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "title": "'Just go out and pitch.' Dodgers' Tyler Glasnow is efficient in his first spring start",
    "description": "Tyler Glasnow pitched two-plus innings, retiring the first six batters he faced before coming out of the game after allowing a leadoff single to start the third inning.",
    "fullText": "Dodgers right-hander Tyler Glasnow is an admitted overthinker. But you wouldn't know it based on his efficient first spring training start Thursday against the Chicago White Sox at Camelback Ranch.\n\nGlasnow pitched two-plus innings, retiring the first six batters before coming out after giving up a single to start the third inning. Using a pitch mix that included a fastball that sat at 97 mph, Glasnow struck out the side in the first inning before recording another strikeout to close out the second. Having thrown just 28 pitches, Glasnow started the third inning and threw three more pitches before coming out of the Dodgers' 7-6 win.\n\n\"Very in rhythm,\" manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"Very efficient, used his entire pitch mix, it was really good. Good to see him get into the third inning. Positive day.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old entering his third season with the Dodgers credits his coaches for keeping his mechanics on point.\n\n\"It allows me to just go out and pitch and be athletic,\" Glasnow said after his outing. \"I'm able to just go out and play baseball as opposed to trying to tinker and fix certain stuff.\"\n\nThough he was plagued by injuries in his second season with the Dodgers, Glasnow finished on a high note, giving up just four earned runs over 21-1/3 postseason innings, good for a 1.69 ERA, pitching as a starter and a reliever. It was Glasnow’s first taste of the postseason as a Dodger, since a right-elbow injury ended his 2024 campaign in August, and was highlighted by his first career save in Game 6 of the World Series.\n\nGlasnow called the experience \"great.\"\n\n\"When you go in with all those nerves and that pressure and that excitement, it’s just such an unbelievable feeling to go out [there],\" he said last week. \"Especially to be a starter and a reliever and just to be thrown into different situations. It was awesome. It was extremely memorable for me, and I’m craving to do it again. And hopefully we can do it again and get a three-peat.”\n\nLooking to build off his impressive postseason, Glasnow enters the season with a newfound confidence.\n\nLast year Glasnow was placed on the injured list because of right shoulder inflammation at the end of April and did not pitch again until just before the All-Star Break. The Santa Clarita native has a long history of injuries — including Tommy John surgery in 2021 — and never has clocked more than 135 innings in a season.\n\nOver the winter he got married and made adjustments that he hopes will better his health. A successful season means staying off the IL.\n\n“Pitching well and staying healthy,” Glasnow said when asked about goals. “Just doing all that and trying to make as many starts as I can, and just executing every start and being healthy in the postseason.”\n\nWith most of the Dodgers’ regulars having made their spring debuts, there is one who has yet to get an at-bat in a Cactus League game: Mookie Betts. Roberts said his star shortstop will not play until Sunday at the earliest.\n\n“It’s load management,\" Roberts said. \"I wanted Mookie to start a little bit later, as far as not getting into spring training ready to go, and kind of use spring training to build up, given it’s six weeks. So, he’s building up nicely. So, he’ll be in the lineup soon.”\n\nInfielder Hyeseong Kim played his final spring training game Thursday, Roberts confirmed, as the utility man is set to join Team South Korea for the World Baseball Classic.\n\nKim has been perhaps the Dodgers’ most pleasant surprise of the spring, batting .462 with a 1.154 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, five RBIs and a home run in the sixth inning Thursday, while playing deft defense at second base and in center field.\n\nIt's a key development since Tommy Edman will start the season on the IL.\n\n“He’s had a great spring,” Roberts said of Kim. “I think his confidence is continuing to grow. His comfort level, being around the guys. I think he’s taking great at-bats. It was good to see him in center field yesterday. He made a couple of nice plays out in center field. We’re going to lose him shortly. He’s going to go to his team for the WBC, which I’m excited for him. Disappointed that we can’t watch him every day, but he’s had a great spring and looking forward to him having a great WBC and getting back.”\n\n Delivered at the start of each series.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "These 3 teams are only realistic 2026 NBA title contenders, per Phil Jackson",
    "description": "Over 90 percent of NBA champions have won 40 games before losing 20. This year's very exclusive club is all set.",
    "fullText": "The 40-before-20 club for the 2025-2026 NBA season is set.\n\nWith the Boston Celtics' defeat at the hands of the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night, there will be only three teams that qualify under Phil Jackson's tried-and-true rule for NBA championship contenders. For those unaware, as I diagram every year, the legendary coach once asserted that a title-caliber NBA team must win 40 games before it loses 20 to be taken seriously as a group capable of winning that year's Larry O'Brien Trophy. It's a principle tied to great teams that build good habits in the context of a long regular season and accrue enough of a lead in the standings to avoid burning the jets through all 82 games.\n\nOver 90 percent of all champions in the last 46 years have won 40 games before losing 20.\n\nHere are the 40-before-20 teams for the 2025-2026 NBA season:\n\nThe reigning NBA champion Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe upstart East-leading Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe ascending San Antonio Spurs.\n\nBased on the 40-before-20 rule, it stands to reason that one of these three squads will very likely be the 2026 NBA champion come June.\n\nOf course, we shouldn't necessarily treat 40-before-20 as an end-all, be-all type of rule. It's simply a matter of prior established precedent and the fact that great teams tend to win 40 before losing 20. But in a modern context, 40-before-20 might not hold as much water as it used to. In the last three years alone, a No. 8 seed (the 2023 Miami Heat), a No. 5 seed (the 2024 Dallas Mavericks), and a No. 4 seed (the 2025 Indiana Pacers) all qualified for the NBA Finals. None of them won it all, of course. But if not for a Tyrese Haliburton Achilles injury in Game 7 of the 2025 finals, perhaps the underdog Pacers' story ends differently.\n\nIf you make the Finals alone, regardless of whether you won 40 before 20, you have a chance to win it all. Why? Because we still have to play the games. One of these years, a team that didn't qualify for 40-before-20 will finally break through and win the championship again. I will contend that 40-before-20 should and will hold true most of the time, but not always.\n\nOn that note, the 2026 season is shaping up to be one where an outlier team is the last one standing.\n\nHere are a few NBA squads who missed out on 40-before-20 in 2026 but still certainly seem capable of winning it all this summer.\n\nAs long as they roster three-time league MVP Nikola Jokić, I believe the Denver Nuggets, who won the 2023 title, will always have a chance at the NBA title. This year, Denver has surrounded Jokić with the best team on paper that he's ever had. Health, in fact, was arguably the biggest reason the Nuggets fell short of the 40-before-20 mark. Health, for all intents and purposes, may also ultimately determine whether this version of Denver can reach its peak.\n\nIt may well depend on the availability of Jayson Tatum, but you should doubt the Boston Celtics at your own risk. In what was supposed to be a transitional year, Joe Mazzulla's team has plugged away at the near-top of the Eastern Conference standings all year. Jaylen Brown and Derrick White have predictably been brilliant. Key reserve Payton Pritchard has levelled up. And breakout talents like Neemias Queta have fueled the resurgent Celtics. If they get their face of the franchise back with plenty of on-ramp before the playoffs, the Celtics very well could win their second title in three seasons.\n\nI'm also high on the New York Knicks. Jalen Brunson's and Karl-Anthony Towns' defensive limitations are not enough for me to overlook what the Knicks are capable of. At the time of this writing, the Knicks have won 12 of their last 16 games. Any team capable of piecing together a midseason stretch like that deserves to be taken seriously as championship-worthy. The Knicks were a few bounces away from their first NBA Finals in a quarter-century last spring. Perhaps this is the year they make it back.\n\nIf this indeed is the sort of NBA season where a team on the outside of the 40-before-20 club wins the title, I'd venture to guess that one of these three mentioned squads will be the one to do it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Here are the 2026 NBA 40-before-20 title contenders, per Phil Jackson",

    "fullText": "Five U.S. World Cup candidates playing across Europe’s top five leagues will fall well short of winning a domestic championship this season.\n\nBut as those campaigns hit the homestretch, culminating in May before attention turns to this summer’s World Cup, the group remains in the chase for continental trophies.\n\nOnly one current USMNT player has appeared in — let alone won — a Champions League final. Christian Pulisic was a sub in Chelsea’s 2021 triumph over Manchester City. His AC Milan team didn’t qualify for European competition this season.\n\nWith the knockout playoffs complete this week, highlighted by an extraordinary night in northwest Italy involving Weston McKennie and his ousted Juventus side, Friday’s draws will determine the Round-of-16 pairings in the UEFA Champions League, second-tier Europa League and third-level Conference League.\n\nAtalanta midfielder Yunus Musah\n\nBayer Leverkusen midfielder Malik Tillman\n\nAtlético Madrid midfielder Johnny Cardoso\n\nOlympique Lyonnais midfielder Tanner Tessmann\n\nCrystal Palace defender Chris Richards\n\nRegardless of how the Champions League draw plays out, Atalanta and Bayer Leverkusen will face a massive challenge: One will play Barcelona, the other Bayern Munich. Atlético Madrid will await Tottenham Hotspur or Liverpool.\n\nIn addition to the national team regulars, Diego Kochen, a U.S. under-21 national team goalkeeper, is a backup for Barcelona, which will take on Paris Saint-Germain or Newcastle. He has attended a senior national team camp but, without U.S. or Barcelona first-team appearances, is not in the World Cup mix.\n\nThe two legs will take place March 10-11 and 17-18.\n\nOlympique Lyonnais, the Europa League’s top seed after the initial stage, received a playoff bye and will face French rival Lille or Spain’s Celta Vigo on March 12 and 19.\n\nCrystal Palace, which knocked out Zrinjski Mostar on Thursday on a 3-1 aggregate, will clash with Mainz (Germany) or Larnaca (Cyprus) on March 12 and 19. Richards played every minute of the two legs against the Bosnian opponent.\n\nAside from McKennie, U.S. regulars with clubs that failed to advance in either of the previous two Champions League stages included Tim Weah (Olympique Marseille), Folarin Balogun (Monaco) and Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven).\n\nOn Thursday, despite a 1-0 victory at Stuttgart, Auston Trusty and Celtic were ousted from the Europa League on a 4-2 aggregate.\n\nThe elimination of Juventus and Monaco this week ended terrific campaigns by McKennie and Balogun, respectively.\n\nMcKennie started all 10 matches, scoring four goals, including a three-game streak between November and January. On Wednesday, his 82nd-minute header while his team was down to 10 men capped a three-goal aggregate comeback that forced extra time before Türkiye’s Galatasaray prevailed.\n\nWESTON MCKENNIE DOES IT AGAIN! 🇺🇸\n\nJuventus overturn a three-goal deficit to complete the comeback in Turin 🤯 pic.twitter.com/PnVKw0C1FZ\n\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) February 25, 2026\n\nBalogun, the U.S. team’s first-choice striker, also had a three-game scoring streak this winter, then recorded two goals against Paris Saint-Germain last week in the first leg of their two-game playoff. PSG advanced Wednesday on a 5-4 aggregate.\n\nAtlético Madrid reached the Round of 16 by routing Club Brugge 4-1 on Tuesday for a 7-4 advantage.

    "fullText": "Glen Kuiper, the former Oakland A's TV broadcaster who was fired after he used a racial slur on air while discussing his visit to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, will be returning to the airwaves, calling the radio play-by-play for the San Francisco Giants’ exhibition game against Team USA next week.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle first reported Kuiper's move across the bay, as well as the fact that Kuiper will fill in on about a dozen games after the team held “definite conversations” about the veteran broadcaster.\n\n“The Giants are committed to inclusion, respect and earning our fans’ trust,” Rachel Heit, the Giants’ chief marketing officer, told the Chronicle. “We had numerous conversations about the requirements for excellence we expect from our broadcasters. Glen’s addition to the broadcast team is reflective of how he’s approached his growth and what he’s demonstrated from an accountability perspective.”\n\nIt's been nearly three years since Kuipe's voice appeared during an MLB game, but the San Francisco Giants’ leadership believes he's taken \"full responsibility,\" according to Heit.\n\nThe moment occurred during his 17th season as the A’s play-by-play announcer, on May 5, 2023, when he is heard saying, \"we had a phenomenal day today at (N-word) museum and Arthur Bryant’s Barbecue,\" before a game between the A’s and Royals.\n\nBroadcaster Glen Kuiper opened the top of the sixth with an apology for something that he said earlier in the broadcast. No idea what that might have been. #Athletics #RootedInOakland pic.twitter.com/EnAkn7oSaR\n\n— Uprooted (@uprootedoakland) May 6, 2023\n\nKuiper later apologized for what he had said during the game's sixth inning.\n\n\"A little bit earlier in the show, I said something that didn’t come out quite the way I wanted it to, and I just wanted to apologize if it sounded different than I meant it,\" Kuiper said.\n\nAbout two weeks after the on-air incident, NBC Sports California fired Kuiper for using a racial slur.\n\n\"Following an internal review, the decision has been made for NBC Sports California to end its relationship with Glen Kuiper, effective immediately,” the network said in a statement released on May 22, 2023. “We thank Glen for his dedication to Bay Area baseball over the years.”\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Lindsay Schnell contributed to this article.\n\nNoe Padilla is a Northern California Reporter for USA Today.

    "description": "Denis Bouanga is staying in Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "Denis Bouanga is staying in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter months of transfer speculation linking the Gabon international with high-profile moves, LAFC announced Wednesday that it has re-signed the forward to a contract extension as a Designated Player through 2028, with an option through the 2029-30 season.\n\nMore history to make 😤\n\n📝 #LAFC and @BouangaDenis have agreed to a contract extension through 2028 with an option through the 2029-30 season.\n\n🔗 https://t.co/XYtihTc0pz pic.twitter.com/L6N1YuelJx\n\n— LAFC (@LAFC) February 25, 2026\n\n“At this club, performance matters,” LAFC Co-President & General Manager John Thorrington said in a statement. “Denis has delivered at an elite level with historic consistency since the day he arrived, and he has helped us win multiple trophies. This new contract reflects that. We’re proud of what he’s accomplished here and are motivated to continue building on that success together.”\n\nThe extension follows a winter of reported interest from multiple clubs. Inter Miami made a $13 million offer for the 31-year-old attacker while also pursuing Germán Berterame, but LAFC immediately rejected the bid. Reports also indicated that Brazilian side Fluminense submitted an offer in the $12-15 million range and had reached an agreement in principle with the player, with negotiations centering on payment structure.\n\nDespite the noise, Bouanga’s stance never appeared to waver.\n\nDuring the Coachella Valley Invitational, when asked directly by fans whether he was leaving, Bouanga responded emphatically: “I promise I stay.”\n\nThat promise now has formal backing.\n\nBouanga, who joined LAFC as a Designated Player on Aug. 5, 2022, quickly established himself as one of the most productive players in club history. He scored a stoppage-time winner in Portland to clinch the 2022 Supporters’ Shield and added two goals in the MLS Cup Playoffs as LAFC lifted the 2022 MLS Cup.\n\nIn 2023, he delivered one of the most prolific seasons ever by a Black & Gold player. Bouanga scored 20 regular-season goals with seven assists in 31 appearances to win the MLS Golden Boot, becoming the third player in club history to claim the award. Across all competitions, he recorded 38 goals and 14 assists in 48 appearances, tying the club’s single-season scoring record.\n\nHe followed that campaign with 20 goals and 11 assists in 32 regular-season matches in 2024, earning MLS Best XI honors and another All-Star selection. In 2025, Bouanga raised the bar again, scoring a career-high 24 regular-season goals. He became the first player in MLS history to post three consecutive 20-goal seasons and finished as a finalist for MLS MVP award for the second straight year.\n\nLast season, he also became LAFC’s all-time leading scorer, surpassing the previous mark of 93 goals. Bouanga now has 105 goals and 43 assists in 155 appearances across all competitions for the club.\n\nHis importance has only grown with the arrival of Son Heung-Min. The two formed one of the league’s most productive attacking partnerships, combining for 25 goals and eight assists (including playoffs) after Son joined the squad. Between late August and early October, the duo accounted for 18 consecutive LAFC goals, setting a new MLS record for most straight goals scored by two teammates.\n\nBouanga’s influence was on display in LAFC’s 3-0 win over Inter Miami in the 2026 MLS season opener. In front of 75,673 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, he scored the second goal of the night, sprinting past goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair before finishing into an empty net. He also provided multiple dangerous moments in transition as LAFC opened its campaign with a statement victory over the reigning MLS Cup champions.\n\nInternationally, Bouanga has earned 53 caps for Gabon, scoring 17 goals. He debuted in January 2017 and most recently recorded a hat trick in a World Cup qualifying win over Seychelles in September 2025.\n\n4' Denis Bouanga ⚽️\n34' Denis Bouanga ⚽️\n38' Denis Bouanga ⚽️@BouangaDenis wastes no time with a first half hat trick for Gabon in World Cup Qualifiers. 🇬🇦 pic.twitter.com/RR21e3Evo2\n\n— Major League Soccer (@MLS) September 4, 2025\n\nNow, with his future secured, Bouanga remains central to LAFC’s ambitions.\n\n“I’m grateful to LAFC for the trust they’ve shown in me,” Bouanga said via the club’s release. “From the beginning, my family and I have felt at home in Los Angeles. It’s an honor to represent this club and our supporters every time I put on the jersey. I believe in what we are building here, and I’m motivated to keep improving, winning more trophies, and helping this club reach even higher.”\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, both club and player have made their position clear. Denis Bouanga isn’t going anywhere.",

    "description": "Quinn Hughes’ stock has done nothing but rise this year. Here’s what makes him so special.",
    "fullText": "Until recently, the general consensus was that Cale Makar is the best defenseman in the world, with Quinn Hughes as the clear No. 2.\n\nNow, the perception seems to be changing.\n\nSince the Vancouver Canucks traded Hughes to the Minnesota Wild in December, dozens of writers, podcasters and broadcasters have noted their shock at how good Hughes actually is — and his Olympic performance with Team USA only increased his stock.\n\nBut he’s the same player he always was. The difference is that more people are paying attention to him, being two time zones closer to the Eastern Conference and all.\n\nUtah Mammoth defenseman Nate Schmidt played a season with Hughes and the Canucks. It was only Hughes’ third year in the NHL, but Schmidt could already see that he was special.\n\n“You could tell it was all in there if he could just gather even more confidence when he has the puck,” Schmidt said. “He’s such a game changer. I think the gap between him and Makar has shrunk, and it’s always been pretty close.”\n\nQUINN HUGHES! USA WINS! 🦅 pic.twitter.com/WxbCRKxPiO\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 18, 2026\n\nPart of what makes Hughes so good is his ability to get through the neutral zone with the puck. Rather than skating forward, he turns his back to oncoming forecheckers.\n\nThat opens up passing options behind him and to both wings, in addition to the ability to pivot around the forechecker and advance the puck.\n\nThe more time you can spend in the offensive zone, the more likely you are to both score and prevent the opponent from scoring — and that’s a major factor in the 57 points Hughes has scored through 52 games this season.\n\n“His skating separates him,” said Mammoth defenseman Sean Durzi, who grew up around the Hughes boys when they lived in Toronto while their father was working for the Maple Leafs.\n\n“His conditioning, how efficient he is. He plays 30 minutes (a game) and it looks like it’s pretty easy for him, so that’s a credit to how well he’s done.”\n\nDurzi noted the game the Mammoth played against Hughes in Vancouver just before the trade, and Hughes had a hand in every one of the Canucks’ scoring chances in the first period.\n\n“He’s got that calmness to him that allows him to step up big in these pressured situations, but, like, he’s got that passion, too. I think the whole family’s got that love for the game and they want to be out there in those moments and I think he’s done a good job of that.”\n\nWith two parents who work in high-level hockey, it perhaps shouldn’t come as a surprise that all three of their boys became NHL stars. Durzi credits his three brothers for his success, and he noted that the same must be true of the Hughes brothers.\n\nThe Mammoth host Hughes and the Wild on Friday. Despite being in the same division as Minnesota, Utah has yet to lose to the Wild in regulation, and they’re a perfect 3-0-0 against Hughes as a Canuck.\n\nUtah head coach André Tourigny gave his thoughts about Hughes after the Mammoth’s practice on Thursday.\n\n“We know how good he is. He’s one of the best players in the world — all positions,\" Tourigny said. “I think there’s a debate to be made on a few, maybe five, six guys in the world, and he’s probably at that level.”\n\nAdded Schmidt with a laugh: “Makes me feel a lot better about myself, because if he can go out there and dominate and game-change in the Olympics, it makes me feel a lot better when he does it against me in the regular season.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nGetting an accurate read on Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert isn't an easy thing to do, especially with differing opinions on him.\n\nSome think Herbert is a top-five-ish quarterback, while others scoff at that notion because what has Herbert done to deserve such an elevated ranking?\n\nYes, we've seen glimpses, but what else? Herbert is 0-3 in the postseason, and while he's had three double-digit winning seasons, each has ended the same way. Poorly.\n\nBut will 2026 be different? Mike McDaniel is his offensive coordinator, and hopefully, his two stud offensive linemen are healthy.\n\nFor ESPN's Seth Walder, this could be the year where it all comes together for Justin.\n\n\"Herbert has long been held in a slightly higher regard than his production would indicate, and the pairing with new offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel (and, ideally, two healthy tackles) should give us the opportunity to finally see Herbert perform with a favorable supporting cast,\" Walder wrote. \"This could be the year we see Herbert's elite ceiling.\"\n\nMore:Steelers' 2026 QB prediction nightmare fuel for fans\n\nI've been hearing it since his rookie season, and each year, Herbert, at times, through no fault of his own, others were his fault, has failed.\n\nSo, color me skeptical on that.\n\nBut McDaniels, as his OC, could be a game-changer. We saw his work with Tua Tagovailoa in the early stages in Miami, so the imagination runs wild with the thoughts of what he could be with Herbert.\n\nBut rather, seeing is believing, and in Herbert's case, he doesn't have the benefit of the doubt. He's failed too many times.\n\nSo, until I actually see it, it's status quo on how he's viewed as a quarterback.\n\nAnalyst offers horror 4-word prediction for Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs\n\nESPN offers harsh Shedeur Sanders' Browns reality in franchise's QB search\n\nBengals give stunning Trey Hendrickson future quote that fans will love\n\nMike Evans' agent drops huge update over Buccaneers future\n\nVikings oddly predicted to go after Pro Bowl QB in free agency\n\nRams named landing spot for rocket-arm QB\n\nBills' Joe Brady reiterates stellar Keon Coleman desire",

    "fullText": "Biggest NFL Combine takeaways from Day 1 of draft workouts originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL fans alike gather in person or around a television to witness something unique to football. Football is not the only sport that conducts a “Combine” to put incoming rookies through interviews, drills, medical evaluations and mental tests. However, it is the only sport where the “Combine” has become must-see TV.\n\nAlso known as the National Invitational Camp (NIC), the combine like everything else has a history. The four day football evaluation did not begin as the television event it is now. Just like the images of the NFL Draft decades ago, the combine used to be a small affair. Before 1976, the combine did not exist.\n\nIn the pre-1970s, NFL teams rarely conducted any sort of physical assessment of potential incoming college players. During that same period, the NFL Draft was also 17 rounds. Not the seven rounds it is today.\n\nThe first implementation any sort of physical assessment was actually started by the New York Jets who in 1976 invited prospects to their headquarters to be interviewed and tested.\n\n“Besides character and intelligence, the other non-football thing we put a premium on is the medical aspect,” Mike Hickey, the Jets’ director of player personnel, wrote in a column for The New York Times in April 1983. “We attempt to have every player we are interested in have an orthopedic physical by our team physicians.”\n\nThe early days of what would eventually become the Scouting Combine were just a series of visits. The opposite of pro day visits we have now. Instead of all the scouts and front office personnel travelling to Florida’s pro day or USC’s pro day, the prospects would travel to the respective NFL cities to be tested.\n\nThe process was complicated and expensive. In the early 1980s, Dallas Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm recommended to the NFL’s competition committee that teams should work together to “centralize the evaluation process”.\n\nThe first Combine took place in 1982 in Tampa, Florida. That first Combine included 16 teams and 163 players. The number of invitees has doubled over time to around 300 over the last decade plus.\n\nMore:2026 NFL combine: Full list of draft prospects\n\nInitially there were three groups of camps. The Indianapolis-based National Football Scouting Inc (NFS), BLESTO and Quadra Scouting. In 1985, all three camps were merged to save on operating costs. The central location in 1985 was Phoenix, Arizona. The central location for 1986 was New Orleans, Louisiana, however, in 1987 the venue was moved to Indianapolis where it has remained ever since.\n\nOver time more and more aspects were added to the process. Just like the old NFL Drafts consisted of a closed-door operation not open to the fans, so was the Combine. As the Combine itself evolved, so did the public’s interest in it.\n\nMore:How the NFL Scouting Combine got its name: Schedule, history and origins of the biggest NFL Draft event\n\nThe first ever televised NFL Scouting Combine didn’t occur until 22 years after its inaugural event in 1982. In 2004 the then new NFL Network aired six one-hour end of the day recaps on the events of the Combine. In 2005, those one hour recaps became two hour recaps. In 2006 and 2007 the Combine coverage grew to over 25 hours of television coverage.\n\nIn the 2020s, the Combine is viewed as the second largest and most important event in the pre-draft process. Second only to the NFL Draft itself. Today, the combine evaluations are critical to the work NFL teams do on these prospects. Game tape will always be No. 1, but right behind the in game evaluations is the NFL Scouting Combine.\n\nDefensive Ends begin their workout, starting with the 40 times. Defensive End is a 'traits' position. They will naturally run better 40 times that almost all of the Defensive Tackles. In large part to a completely different body type as well as technique.\n\nVincent Anthony Jr - DE - Duke: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt: 4.85\n\nDavid Bailey - DE - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 4.51 / 2nd attempt: 4.54\n\nBailey checked speed off his to-do list. Bailey's time is the seventh fastest 40 time by a Defensive End in Combine history. The all time record belongs to Amare Barno (4.36). Bailey was not satisfied with his time.\n\nJaishawn Barham - DE - Michigan: 1st attempt: 4.65 / 2nd attempt: 4.66\n\nBarham pulled up and grabbed his hamstring in the last 5 yards of the 40 and still came within 0.01 of his uninjured time.\n\nDani Dennis-Scott - DE - Penn State: 1st attempt: 4.51 / 2nd attempt: 4.65\n\nGeorge Gumbs Jr - DE - Florida: 1st attempt: 4.70 / 2nd attempt: 4.66\n\nRomello Height - DE - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 4.64 / 2nd attempt: 4.65\n\nCashius Howell - DE - Texas A&M: 1st attempt: 4.60 / 2nd attempt: 4.60\n\nQuintayvious Hutchins - DE - Boston College: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMarvin Jones Jr - DE - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nNyjalik Kelly - DE - UCF: 1st attempt: 4.91 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMalachi Lawrence - DE - UCF: 1st attempt: 4.53 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMax Llewellyn - DE - Iowa: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt:\n\nTrey Moore - DE - Texas: 1st attempt: 4.55 / 2nd attempt:\n\nLT Overton - DE - Alabama: 1st attempt: 4.91 / 2nd attempt:\n\nTJ Parker - DE - Clemson: 1st attempt: 4.68 / 2nd attempt:\n\nMason Reiger - DE - Wisconsin: 1st attempt: 4.79 / 2nd attempt:\n\nR Mason Thomas - DE - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.67 / 2nd attempt:\n\nNadame Tucker - DE - W. Michigan: 1st attempt: 4.74 / 2nd attempt:\n\nWesley Willaims - DE - Duke: 1st attempt: 4.90 / 2nd attempt:\n\nStacey Dales reporting: Miami DE Rueben Bain confirmed he will not run the 40 at the Combine.\n\n\"If they do the draft based on personality, we're looking at a Top 5 pick right there.\"\n\nEveryone in Indy is loving them some Lee Hunter.\n\n📺 #NFLCombine on @NFLNetworkpic.twitter.com/1cuC7882rD\n\n— Texas Tech Football (@TexasTechFB) February 26, 2026\n\nBroad Jump - Albert Regis: 9'8\"\n\nVertical Jump - Gracen Halton: 36.50\"\n\n20-yard shuttle - Jackie Marshall: 4.68 seconds\n\n10-yard split - Zane Durant: 1.66 seconds\n\nPlayers line up in their stance, the administrator of the drill pulls on the football on s stick, the player surges forward. The ball on a stick then indicates whether the player cuts right or left, bends around the corresponding cone and sprints ten yards downfield in a straight line.\n\nVery few players participated in this drill and those that competed all looked similar. Some bend a little wider, but all completed the drill with no directional or completion issues.\n\nIt's football on a stick time. This drill includes two large hula hoop like circles on the ground. Players will run a figure eight while picking up two bound towels and relocating them to the opposite side of the circle. This measures a players' 'bend'.\n\nIn addition to how they bend, towel placement is important. Players are expected to precisely place the towel. Taking it from three o'clock and moving it to nine o'clock on the respective hoops.\n\nGary Smith III of UCLA struggled with the towel placement, including one rep the had the second towel outside the hoop and at almost seven o'clock. Darrell Jackson Jr of Florida State also struggled somewhat. He is a large human. Fluidity and bend may not be his biggest strength.\n\nThe darling of this group Zane Durant did not participate in the Run the Hoop Drill. However, grading who did well and who did not followed suit with the Pass Rush Drill. Both grade smoothness and tightness in similar ways.\n\nThe school with the most prospects in Indy is @AggieFootball.\n\nTheir head coach Mike Elko stopped by the booth to chat with @MoveTheSticks and @RichEisen!\n\n2026 NFL Combine on NFL Network\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/cSH85fnhY2\n\n— NFL Network (@nflnetwork) February 26, 2026\n\nThe Run and Club Drill is more intended for what Defensive Tackles typically do. Attempting to shed or get around blocks within a confined space. The club is the easy part. The spin will have varied degrees of fluidity. The tricky part is the final turn and flattening.\n\nMost of the prospects struggled with the spin move aspect. Most lack the instinctive plant foot. Resulting in what looks like moving around the bag instead of spinning around the bag. The chop and rip aspect just before they need to flatten also gave some players issues.\n\nEach of these interior linemen move through this drill with speed and power. What separates the prospects is the ability to execute these moves in a phone booth. The wider the move the less impressive. Zane Durant, again, was by far the best competitor in this drill.\n\nAlso referred to as the 'Swim' drill. Players will drive off the line, hit the first bag, then run forward and swim the next bag, then a sprint to the finish. As it is a pass rushing drill, these will look less impressive than when we see the actual pass rushers doing this drill.\n\nThe following will be relayed as almost pass/fail. Interior defensive lineman typically will work the drill similarly. It will either look good, or it won't.\n\nNick Barrett, Rayshaun Benny, Zane Durant, Deven Eastern, Gracen Halton, Lee Hunter, Darrell Jackson Jr, Tim Keenan III, Jackie Marshall, Chris McClellan, Kayden McDonald, Tyler Onyedim, Albert Regis, Damonic Williams,\n\nCameron Ball, DeMonte Capeheart, Bobby Jamison-Travis, Kaleb Proctor, Gary Smith III,\n\nZane Durant was clearly the class of the group for the Pass Rush Drill. While Rayshaun Benny, Lee Hunter, and Chris McClellan were are better than the rest, Durant stood head and shoulders above the rest. There is real athleticism, not positional athleticism with Durant. He could create real creativity from a defensive coordinator with his agility and balance from the defensive tackle position.\n\n\"They call it the four bag agility drill because there are four bags on the ground\" Rich Eisen said. This drill is usually done with much more fluidity and smoothness when done by pass rushers, but it does measure agility and change of direction.\n\nRayshaun Benny of Michigan was the first defensive tackle to make this drill look smooth. Some minimal bag movement, but otherwise very smooth and fast.\n\nZane Durant followed Benny and made it looks easy. Kept his eyes down through most of it, which is not recommended, but very smooth. \"He's so athletic\" Jeremiah said after his attempt.\n\nBryson Eason had another smooth run of this drill. Perhaps not going all out speed wise, but enough that it didn't seem he was worried about the changes.\n\nDeven Eastern might be the first participant to do the drill at his top speed. Legs under him, no glaring mistakes, at full speed.\n\nGracen Halton had a really solid run. Fast with high knees, no bag infractions. Really solid.\n\nLee Hunter showed some stiffness in his hips, but made this drill look much better than the Wave Drill.\n\nTim Keenan III had an interesting run through the bags. Lateral movement looked much better than average but struggled in forwards and backwards transitions.\n\nKayden McDonald looked much better in the bad agility drill. No stumbles, close to full speed, lateral movement was good and he kept his feet under him.\n\nThe Wave Drill forces players to display lateral quickness and recovery speed. Most tackles will perform this similarly due to the nature of the position. When someone excels in this drill it pops off the screen.\n\nCaleb Banks anticipated the changes well, but lacks an explosiveness that shows up on screen.\n\nNick Barrett had an almost stumble early but saved it. Less controlled than Banks, but the results were better.\n\nFollowing Capeheart's 40 times, his Wave Drill was similar. Awkward movements but unquestioned results. Not smooth but fast and his cuts didn't slow him down.\n\nGusta and Halton both had stumbles after the first change of direction.\n\nLee Hunter was a bit choppy but remained in control, no slipping and no guessing the change. Very solid, just not fast.\n\nJackie Marshall didn't stumble and didn't miss at any point. However, he was yelled at throughout the drill to open it up. As if he was moving a little slower to better anticipate the changes.\n\nKayden McDonald fell on the first move clear to the turf. They cancelled his run and he'll get another change to try the first attempt again. His second attempt was better but not by much. No falls, but he did appear to be pacing himself (which teams don't love in this drill) and seemed to be confused on the direction queues.\n\nTyler Onyedim looked really good. One of the ones that pops off the screen. Completely under control, feet under him, adamant moves, good spring out of the cuts.\n\nIan Rapoport reporting: Tennessee Titans agree to trade DT T'Vondre Sweat to the Jets for DE Jermaine Johnson.\n\nAlbert Regis - DT - Texas A&M: 1st attempt: 4.92 / 2nd attempt: 4.88\n\nRegis had the best 'looking' start (1.73 split) of the tackles thus far. The first tackle to not have the drag foot start. High knees and driving through the line.\n\nGood start, not as good as the first one. Form got a little wide in the first ten, but he cleaned it up and improved on his already good time.\n\nKaleb Proctor - DT - SE Lousiana: 1st attempt: 4.80 / 2nd attempt: 4.84\n\nClean start (1.69 split), very fluid gate. Runs smoother than hard. Giving a very solid first 40 time.\n\nThe form lost a little something on the back end. Still a good time, he'll stick with the first 4.80 time.\n\nChris McClellan - DT - College: 1st attempt: 5.05 / 2nd attempt: 5.08\n\nA very clunky start (1.80 split), but recovered down the stretch make up some of that time. Comes out of his form early, but the drive/kick makes up for it.\n\nFirst step was faster but still had a drag foot on the second step. Really pushed through yards 10-20.\n\nJackie Marshall - DT - Baylor: 1st attempt: 4.88 / 2nd attempt: 4.92\n\nReally nice run. Good start (1.69 split) fluid throughout. Despite the smoothness, strong steps led to a very nice time. Shaving almost a tenth off the expectation.\n\nTim Keenan III - DT - Alabama: 1st attempt: 5.32 / 2nd attempt: 5.31\n\nKeenan is another larger DT. Another less than explosive start (1.84 split) but he recovered nicely with a steady but strong gate.\n\nGood start again. He looked to be ahead of his own pace at the midway point, but began to slow in the last ten yards. Giving him a slightly longer time.\n\nLee Hunter - DT - Texas Tech: 1st attempt: 5.25 / 2nd attempt: 5.18\n\nThe first attempt will seem like a bad number, but Hunter is a large man. 6'4, 325. The 1.82 10-yard split is a little underwhelming; lacks a first step explosion you want to see.\n\nHunter made a significant improvement. Similar slower split but he drove hard down the stretch. Improving the time by seven one hundredths.\n\nGracen Halton - DT - Oklahoma: 1st attempt: 4.83 / 2nd attempt: 4.86\n\nFaulted on the first start. Strange kick down the stretch, but it works. Halton gives a very good sub 4.9 time.\n\nLess than ideal start but with that same strange kick down the stretch. The start hurt this time as the back end was almost the same.\n\nDavid Gusta - DT - Kentucky: 1st attempt: 4.88 / 2nd attempt: 4.90\n\nReally solid first run. Good start, steps get more aggressive with each passing yard. Very solid at 4.88.\n\nThe second attempt was a very different run. Same good but not explosive start, but this time with a pronounced wide stride.\n\nBryson Eason - DT - Tennessee: 1st attempt: 5.12 / 2nd attempt: 5.09\n\nEason has a relatively fluid movement for a man his size. In control and steady. At 6'3, 315 that was a solid run. Could be big for Eason if he can get under 5.10.\n\nSame controlled, steady run except this time he cleaned up the start and improved his time. Getting under the 5.10 mark as previously predicted. 5.09 on the second attempt.\n\nZane Durant - DT - Penn State: 1st attempt: 4.76 / 2nd attempt: 4.77\n\nDurant comes in with an explosive expectation. Another angry runner. \"We weren't expecting turbulence, but we were expecting a fast 40 time. Both require a seat belt\" Daniel Jeremiah said on the broadcast.\n\nDurant delivers another impressive sub 4.8 time. Almost a carbon copy form wise. Good start and he drives with every step.\n\nBrandon Cleveland - DT - NC State: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.22\n\nCleveland maintains decent upper body form and didn't come out of his crouch until the finish line. Solid measured movement, in control.\n\nCleveland looked to have a good start, but something happened in the middle third. Appeared to be a hamstring pull, but he fought through it and didn't fully pull up until after the finish line. Eisen and Jeremiah could be heard audibly reacting with saying \"oh great\" at almost the same time.\n\nDeMonte Capeheart - DT - Clemson: 1st attempt: 4.85 / 2nd attempt: 4.86\n\nCapeheart is the first of this batch of 40 times to really move. Capeheart had a similar first start to Barrett, but Capeheart fully recovered in before the 10-yard mark and was really churning. Runs like he's angry at the ground.\n\nCapeheart has a way of running, but it works. Same angry, hard steps. Once he gets up to speed it looks awkward, but he's moving.\n\nNick Barrett - DT - South Carolina: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.11\n\nBarrett had a less than clean start on the first attempt but recovered after his second step. The time was not great at 5.11, but if he can clean up the start, he can shave a few hundredths off that time.\n\nBarrett 2nd attempt was exactly the same as the first. In time and form. Start was better, first step was much better, but lost a little something towards the end of the run. \"I think he's a 5.11 runner...\" Rich Eisen said as he crossed the finish line.\n\nCaleb Banks - DT - Florida: 1st attempt: 5.05 / 2nd attempt: 5.13\n\nBanks false faulted on the first two starts of the first attempt. On the third start, Banks ran a respectable time for his size. He looked like a large DT running a 40, but form remained constant.\n\nBanks struggled through his second run adding almost a full tenth to his time. Seemed to lose form and had labored steps in the final third.\n\nCameron Ball - DT - Arkansas: 1st attempt: 5.11 / 2nd attempt: 5.13\n\nBall's first attempt was mildly concerning. Clean start, however, his form broke down just after the 10-yard split and struggled to regain it until about the 30-yard mark. Could improve on the second attempt.\n\nSecond run was not better, but still acceptable. Clean start but slow in the first five. Came out of his form a little early.\n\nFinal Defensive Tackle 40-time leaders: Zane Durant - 4.75, Kaleb Proctor - 4.80, Gracen Halton - 4.82, DeMonte Capeheart - 4.85, David Gusta - 4.88\n\nStacey Dales reporting: 6'3, 335 Florida DT Caleb Banks will perform today despite a broken foot suffered in September. He will be a full participant. Ohio State DT Kayden McDonald will not run the 40 but is expected to participate in the bag drills to show his explosiveness.\n\nRich Eisen and Daniel Jeremiah have begun the broadcast from the NFL Network perch. First up will be defensive tackles. This group has some big names, a few could even crack the first round. Jeremiah has Lee as his No. 1 DT in the class. With Kayden McDonald, Caleb Banks, Peter Woods, and Christen Miller making up the top 5.

    "fullText": "MetLife Stadium got an F- grade from players in the ‘home game field’ category of the NFL Players Association 2026 report cards, an annual survey grading franchises from A+ to F- in a variety of categories.\n\nThe New York Giants as an organization finished 25th overall. The Miami Dolphins were No. 1, and the Pittsburgh Steelers were last among the league’s 32 franchises.\n\nThe 2026 survey was the fourth annual. The first three were made public on the NFLPA website. The NFLPA did not post the results this year due to a grievance filed by the league. Nonetheless, ESPN obtained the report card results.\n\nTreatment of Families: B-\nHome Game Field: F-\nFood/Dining Area: B+\nNutritionist/Dietician: A-\nLocker Room: D\nTraining Room: B-\nTraining Staff: B+\nWeight Room: B\nStrength Coaches: B+\nPosition Coaches: B\nOffensive Coordinator: C+\nDefensive Coordinator: D+\nSpecial Teams Coordinator: B+\nTeam Travel: C\nHead Coach: C\nGeneral Manager: D+\nTeam Ownership: B\n\nHere are some thoughts on a few of the categories.\n\nThe turf at MetLife Stadium has long been a source of consternation among players. The turf was replaced in 2023 and is constantly tested by the NFL, with the league insisting its data shows the MetLife field among the safest in the league.\n\nI wonder if some of that grade is simply following the long-running narrative that the MetLife turf contributes to injuries. I also wonder if part of the grade is a reaction to an ugly, lifeless building that has played host to two of the worst teams in the NFL for most of the past several years.\n\nJoe Schoen of the Giants got, by far, the worst grade of any general manager in the league.\n\nA : Dan Morgan, George Paton, Chris Ballard, Les Snead, Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, John Schneider, Adam Peters\n\nA-: Eric DeCosta, Brandon Beane, Ryan Poles, Brad Holmes, Nick Caserio, James Gladstone, John Spytek, Chris Grier, Darren Mougey, John Lynch, Jason Licht\n\nB+: Terry Fontenot, Brian Gutekunst, Brett Veach, Joe Hortiz, Eliot Wolf, Mike Borgonzi\n\nB: Monti Ossenfort, Jerry Jones, Mickey Loomis, Howie Roseman\n\nWell, of course that players are tired of losing and don’t like Schoen’s product. I think, though, the grade also reflects unhappiness with how Schoen deals with players in negotiations, resulting in a possible lack of trust. It might be a part of the reason why Dawn Aponte was hired and could end up doing a lot of the team’s contract negotiating.\n\nWhatever the reason, it isn’t a good look for Schoen. Whether he wants to admit it or not, he has lost power in the organization, is fortunate to still have his job, and is in a battle to keep it.\n\nIt has been clear for a few years now that the Giants’ once state of the art locker room had become cramped and outdated. The organization is renovating the locker room space this offseason, and I would expect that grade to go up in 2027. The dining area has also been undergoing renovation.\n\nYeah, nobody misses Shane Bowen.\n\nI thought Mike Kafka would have fared better here after his stint as interim head coach.\n\nPlayers liked Brian Daboll well enough as a person. Daboll just lost the magic touch he had in 2022, and there weren’t any signs of it coming back.\n\nJohn Harbaugh: B\nMatt Nagy: C+\nDennard Wilson: B-\nChris Horton: B+\nGreg Roman: D-",

    "fullText": "In a month’s time, Spain and Argentina will face off in the much-anticipated latest instalment of La Finalissima. The European and South American champions will come face-to-face in Doha, with each keen to add another trophy to their cabinets ahead of this summer’s World Cup in North America.\n\nMuch has been made of the impending match-up between Lamine Yamal and Lionel Messi, although 20 other players on the pitch will decide the outcome. Right now, the result is too close to call, although Argentina midfielder Alexis Mac Allister has admitted that he sees Spain are being slightly ahead as of right now, as per Mundo Albiceleste.\n\n“Right now I see Spain above us. I think Spain and France are the two best, and we are there as well.”\n\nSpain are the FIFA ranked number one side at the moment, but Argentina are close behind in 2nd. However, La Roja are set apart by the fact that they have not only once inside 90 minutes since Luis de la Fuente succeeded Luis Enrique as head coach in the aftermath of the 2022 World Cup, that being against Scotland in his second match in charge.\n\nSpain may be considered marginal favourites by some, but Argentina have been there and done it in Doha, where they were victorious in the 2022 World Cup final against France. Whether that plays a part remains to be seen, but given how evenly-matched the two squads are, fine margins could determine who comes out on top – such as the expected absence of Nico Williams.\n\nIt promises to be a fantastic spectacle when Spain and Argentina face off at the Lusail Stadium. There is plenty of domestic action to come before the showpiece event, and that could have a say in who gets their hands on the La Finalissima trophy in Qatar.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts complimented Hyeseong Kim on his fantastic performances so far during spring training.\n\nHeading into Thursday’s game, Kim recorded hits in five of his 10 at-bats and had four RBIs with two stolen bases.\n\n“He’s had a great spring. Hyeseong, I think his confidence is continuing to grow,” Roberts said. “His comfort level, being around the guys, I think he’s taken great at-bats. It was good to see him in centerfield yesterday, made a couple nice plays out in centerfield.”\n\n“We’re going to lose him shortly. He’s going to go to his team for the WBC, which I’m excited for him. Disappointed that we can’t watch him every day, but he’s had a great spring and looking forward to him having a great WBC and getting back here.”\n\nKim continued his tear in Thursday’s win over the White Sox, clubbing his first homer of the spring in a 7-6 win. He will now look to carry his form into the WBC, as Thursday was his final game before departing.\n\nThe Dodgers will also hope he stays hot, as they’re looking for a suitable replacement at second base for Tommy Edman, who is still recovering from offseason surgery. Kim is putting together a strong case for himself, and will certainly get his shot with the Dodgers at some point this season if not Opening Day.\n\nThe post Dave Roberts Praises Hyeseong Kim After Hot Start to Spring appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "title": "6 Best Derek Carr Landing Spots as QB Nears NFL Return",
    "description": "Derek Carr retired from the NFL last season after experiencing lingering shoulder pain from a labral tear. According to NFL […]",
    "fullText": "Derek Carr retired from the NFL last season after experiencing lingering shoulder pain from a labral tear. According to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, there’s a “strong belief” Carr is “very serious” about unretiring after a full year away from football.\n\nStill under contract with the New Orleans Saints, teams would have to trade for Carr rather than simply be allowed to sign him outright. Though, there’s a possibility New Orleans decides to release Carr the moment he unretires to avoid a $36 million cap charge for 2026, the final year of his contract.\n\nIn any event, Carr wants to play football again, and there are plenty of QB-needy teams who could be eager to give him a look. Below, we evaluate six teams that could consider adding Carr this offseason.\n\nNow led by two-time Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski, the Falcons still have 2024 first-round pick Michael Penix Jr. atop the depth chart. But he hasn’t proven himself as a bona fide franchise quarterback just yet. The Falcons may view the opportunity to add Carr as a way to raise the floor of the QB room while having him compete with Penix.\n\nAnother team set to move on from its franchise quarterback, the Cardinals will likely bring Jacoby Brissett back after a strong season. But there’s no guarantee a new coaching staff will get the same results, which could lead to Arizona capitalizing on Brissett’s newfound value. Meanwhile, a team that features one of the NFL’s best tight ends in Trey McBride, plus another potential superstar receiver in Marvin Harrison Jr., may see the value in bringing in another veteran who could immediately lead a winning effort.\n\nThe new-look Browns coaching staff appears intrigued by both Shedeur Sanders and Deshaun Watson. Dillon Gabriel is the other QB in Cleveland, but we wouldn’t imagine the Browns are ready to give up on the 2025 third-round pick. Yet, they also don’t have their franchise QB yet, so adding another arm like Carr this offseason is certainly possible.\n\nThere’s no telling what the Jets do this offseason, but there’s a lot of pressure on second-year head coach Aaron Glenn to get some wins after a woeful 3-14 debut season. Plus, 64-year-old offensive coordinator Frank Reich didn’t sign on just to lose a bunch of games. In other words, it shouldn’t surprise anyone if the Jets look for a veteran who can get some wins right away, and Carr fits the bill.\n\nLike the Cardinals, who are expected to move on from Kyler Murray, the Dolphins are likely done with Tua Tagovailoa. So, who will they get to replace him? Miami will be operating on a strict budget once they move on from Tagovailoa, who’s guaranteed over $50 million in 2025. Meanwhile, Carr hasn’t played in a full year and only made it through 10 games in 2024. In other words, he wouldn’t break the bank. Carr will need to prove he’s healthy and capable of playing at a high level first.\n\nThe Vikings’ QB room is extremely young. So, when they do add a QB this offseason, expect it to be a veteran who may not be a long-term solution. That’s where the 11-year-veteran Carr could be a perfect fit, not only serving as a bridge starter, but also by buying more time to evaluate J.J. McCarthy while he fine-tunes his footwork and accuracy. The four-time Pro Bowl QB could not only be a potential high-level starter in Minnesota, but he will also be able to help coach up McCarthy, too.\n\nArizona Cardinals Pro Bowler Wants To Be Cut From Team\n\nChicago Bears Receiving Trade Offers for Multiple Players\n\nMinnesota Vikings Share ‘Mutual Interest’ with Former First-Round QB",

    "fullText": "Packers General Manager Brian Gutekunst faces several challenging decisions in the 2026 offseason. Most notably, Gutekunst must find a way to create salary cap space to fully participate in offseason activities. The Packers are currently $1.5 million over the 2026 NFL salary cap.\n\nFree agency and the 2026 NFL draft are looming. Green Bay must enter these periods armed with ample cap space to fully capitalize. The Packers’ front office will need to make some challenging decisions to create that space. As a result, several notable veterans may find themselves searching for a new home.\n\nThe Packers’ offensive line managed several injuries over the course of the 2025 season. Young players stepped up and adequately filled the gaps created by veteran absences. Green Bay can take advantage of those successes by moving on from some established veterans on the offensive line.\n\nAaron Banks and Elgton Jenkins both rank within the top five cap hits for the Packers’ 2026 season. Banks ranked 69th of 81 qualifying guards in 2025, and Jenkins missed 10 games due to injury in his age 30 season. The Packers’ investment in these players has not been met with the necessary production to maintain the relationship.\n\nThe Packers could save nearly $20 million in cap space this offseason by moving on from Elgton Jenkins\n\nThe 2x Pro Bowler is 30 years old with an injury history and had contract disputes during last training camp.\n\nHard to imagine he stays on the team under his current contract. pic.twitter.com/VJBui9hF8c\n\n— SleeperPackers (@SleeperPackers) February 17, 2026\n\nRashan Gary represents another possible cap casualty for the Packers. Following a disappointing close to the 2025 season, Gary’s $28 million cap hit in 2026 is hard to justify.\n\nRemoving unfavorable contracts is a popular way to reduce salary cap strain. Another way is by extending contracts of existing players to move money around. Safety Xavier McKinney is just 27 years old and is one of the most effective players on the Packers’ roster.\n\nMcKinney only has two years remaining in his contract and has a cap hit of $19 million or \n\nThe Packers have options to create cap space. Any option that keeps good players in Green Bay should be celebrated.\n\nThe Packers finished with 3 players on PFF's Top 101 players of 2025 list: Xavier McKinney, Jordan Love and Micah Parsons. https://t.co/WTTEowC2uV pic.twitter.com/7qL2BSWJsD\n\n— The Packers Wire (@ThePackersWire) February 20, 2026\n\nThe post How Can the Packers Create Much-Needed Cap Space? appeared first on The Lead.",

Feliciano among the competitors.\n\nFormer Dodgers pitcher Max Scherzer is headed back to the Toronto Blue Jays for his 19th season, ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez reports.\n\nScherzer, who’s won three Cy Young Awards, is 41 years old.\n\nThis season will be his second with the Blue Jays, and his contract is for one year and $3 million.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves struggled in 2025, finishing fourth in the National League East.\n\nBut while they didn’t find success on the field, the MLB’s only publicly owned team still reported “surging revenue,” reports Evan Drellich of The Athletic.\n\n“The Atlanta Braves grew their baseball-side revenues 7 percent, to $635 million, the team said Wednesday,” Drellich reports. “Meanwhile, the club’s real-estate business surrounding its home stadium fared even better: a 45 percent jump to $97 million in 2025.\n\n“Revenues were up 11 percent overall for the year, to $732.5 million.”\n\nThe organization still reported an overall operating loss, but that was largely due to the end of a local television deal with Main Street Sports Group.\n\nThe team is now launching their own network, BravesVision.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMaine's MPA Class A and Class B boys hockey championships have reached the final eight in each classification, and the first pucks in the next round will drop Friday night, February 27.\n\nIn the Class A quarterfinals, the four matchups will be played at the home ice of the higher-seeded teams, including the No. 1 seed Thornton Academy which will host the co-op team from Bangor/Brewer/Skowhegan/Narraguagus at the Biddeford Ice Arena. The winners of the four quarterfinal matchups will then advance to Tuesday's state semifinals at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland.\n\nClass B is divided into a North and South Division where the semifinals are the equivalent of Class A's state quarterfinals. But the semifinals in each division will both be held at a central location with the northern teams facing off on Friday and Saturday at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. The southern semifinals will be played back-to-back on Saturday at Portland's Troubh Ice Arena.\n\nHow to watch Maine boys hockey playoff games\n\nMaine state tournament schedules\n\nThe Class B South championship will then take place on Tuesday, March 3, at Cross Insurance Arena in Portland while the Class B North championship will be staged the following night at Alfond Arena in Orono.\n\nThen it's back to Cross Insurance Arena on Saturday afternoon, March 7, for both the Class A and B state championships which will be played back-to-back starting with the Class B title game at 1 p.m.\n\nWATCH:Maine high school hockey state championships, live on NFHS Network\n\nThornton Academy is the top-ranked team in Maine, ranked No. 16 nationally in the latest MaxPreps rankings, and the boys from Saco are the heavy favorites to win the Class A state title. The Trojans don't figure to be challenged much by the first-year co-op team comprised of students from Bangor/Brewer/Skowhegan/Narraguagus – aka, the Twin City Titans – as the only meeting between them resulted in a 10-0 loss by the newcomers back on December 20.\n\nIn fact, only one team has managed to outskate Thornton Academy this season as the Trojans have piled up an impressive 17-1-0 record. The Trojans' only loss came in a 7-4 upset by Class B Messalonskee back on December 6 in the second game of the season.\n\nThe first real test for Thornton Academy will likely come in the second round against the winner of No. 5 Falmouth and No. 4 Scarborough. The Trojans went 2-0 in the regular season against both those schools, but only managed to beat Falmouth, 3-2, back on January 3. Scarborough also held up well on defense in a 2-0 loss to the Trojans as recently as February 17, indicating that, at their best, either of the two potential semifinalists could at least challenge the frontrunners.\n\nIf the seedings hold, however, Thornton Academy would face the No. 2 seed Cheverus/Yarmouth in the state championship game on March 7. Cheverus/Yarmouth is more than capable of putting up a fight against the Trojans after taking them to overtime in a 4-3 loss back on January 10.\n\nIn the Class B ranks, Messalonskee is the No. 1 seed in the North Division, and as noted above, they are the only team to beat the Class A favorites from Thornton Academy this season. It was in convincing fashion, too, by a count of 7-4, and at 15-3, they are the team to beat headed into the Class B semifinals.\n\nThey'll take on the co-op team representing students from John Bapst/Hermon/Bangor Christian/Deer Isle-Stonington, a team they split with in the regular-season. The teams played back-to-back contests on January 31 and February 4 with Messalonskee winning the first game 3-2 before the co-op team turned the tables for a 3-1 win of their own. The rubber match will take place Saturday with the winner moving on to the Class B North championship next Wednesday at the University of Maine's Alfond Arena in Orono.\n\nThe No. 1 seed in the South division is Gorham/Massabesic, and they figure to have a tougher path to the title against the co-op team from Poland/Leavitt/Gray-NG/Oak Hill. The Gorham squad won both of their regular-season matchups, but both were one-goal affairs earlier this month on February 4 (2-1) and February 14 (3-2).\n\nMaine's Class A and B state championship games will both be streamed live on the NFHS Network. Those games will be played back-to-back on Saturday, March 7, at Portland's Cross Insurance Arena with the first puck dropping at 1 p.m. in the Class B title game.\n\nWATCH:Maine high school hockey state championships, live on NFHS Network\n\nFor local fans hoping to catch the state championship action in person, tickets will be available at the Cross Insurance Arena box office on the day of the game.\n\nTICKET INFORMATION: Maine high school boys hockey championships\n\nBelow is a full schedule of the remaining games in Maine's Class A and B boys hockey state championships.\n\nG1 — #5 Falmouth at #4 Scarborough\n\nG2 — #6 Edward Little at #3 Lewiston/Ararat/Lisbon/Morse\n\nG3 — #7 Fryeburg/Lake Region/Oxford Hills at #2 Cheverus/Yarmouth\n\nG4 — #8 Bangor/Brewer/Skowhegan/Narraguagus at #1 Thornton Academy\n\nBiddeford Ice Arena, Biddeford, ME\n\nCross Insurance Arena, Portland, ME\n\nCross Insurance Arena, Portland, ME\n\nCross Insurance Arena, Portland, ME\n\nG1 —Hampden/Ellsworth/MDI/Nokomis vs. Cony/Monmouth/Erskine/Mt.

    "fullText": "The NFL Players Association has issued its 2026 report cards. The grades have already leaked.\n\nThe NFL has reacted to the situation by sending a memo to all teams, a copy of which PFT has obtained.\n\n\"We understand that the NFL Players Association posted its 'Team Report Cards' on its players-only website today and we are aware that the media is reporting some of the purported results,\" the memo explains. \"As we previously advised, the admissions made by the union and its counsel during the grievance hearing — including that: (i) the Report Cards are 'union speech'; (ii) the union cherry-picks which topics and responses to include and exclude; (iii) players have no role in drafting the Report Cards commentary; (iv) the union chooses which anonymous player quotations to include and which ones to leave out; and (v) the union determines how much weight to allocate to each topic before assigning the 'grades' — confirmed that the Report Cards are neither reliable nor scientifically valid. In fact, these admissions explain the union's ongoing and steadfast refusal to share any data or information about the process that it inaccurately tries to characterize as 'scientifically valid.'\n\n\"Given these significant admitted limitations, we continue to recommend that Clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLA's agenda-driven exercise. We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results. Doing so only provides credibility to the union's media campaign.\n\n\"We will review the developments in light of the Arbitrator's decision.\"\n\nThe arbitrator's decision instructs the NFLPA to tell its members that the grades must not be leaked to the media. While it likely will be impossible to ascertain the source of the leak, it happened. Whether that justifies further action by the NFL under the Collective Bargaining Agreement remains to be seen.\n\nThe NFL declined comment to PFT regarding the leak of the report cards.",

    "fullText": "NFL Combine winners and losers: Live updates on defensive linemen, linebackers in Indianapolis originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL Scouting Combine is underway, and after four days of arrivals, interviews, exams, and meetings, the fun has finally begun.\n\nIt's time to watch the athletic testing and positional drills that skyrocket stocks, starting with the defensive linemen and linebackers. Defensive backs and tight ends will perform on Friday, with running backs, receivers, and quarterbacks headlining Saturday's festivities and offensive linemen rounding out the weekend.\n\nFor all the turbulence at other positions, the 2026 NFL Draft is strong in the front seven. Several edge rushers stand to be top-five picks come April. It's a preternaturally deep linebacker class, and the interior linemen will have starters drafted into Day 3. Perhaps more than any position, it's important to focus on size. Weight and arm length thresholds are king in the trenches, and many top prospects are fighting against historical precedents on their way to Round 1.\n\nAs these prospects vie for draft capital, we'll keep track of the most important performances of the day.\n\nWinner: Caleb Banks, DT, Florida\n\nAt 6062 and 327 pounds, Banks is every bit as big as we thought he was. The rest of his frame was even more impressive, posting 94th-percentile hand size, 94th-percentile arm length, and a 99th-percentile wingspan (via Trevor Sikkema).\n\nBanks is a freak, and ripping off a 5.05 40-yard dash on his first attempt is further proof that he is a different beast than us mere mortals. Banks fought through injuries this season, but if his 61st-percentile 40-yard dash is confirmed, it will be hard to keep that kind of upside out of Round 1.\n\nHis second run went for 5.13 seconds, but with 10-yard splits of 1.76 and 1.77 seconds, he's a comfortable winner early on Thursday.\n\nLoser: Cashius Howell, EDGE, Texas A&M\n\nHowell wasn't surprising anyone with his lack of length. But coming in with 30.25-inch arms is confirmation that he's a negative outlier and bound to hurt his stock. No edge rusher in MockDraftable's database (NFL Combine participants since 1999) has that kind of limitation -- by a half-inch.\n\nThat's a problem anyway one cuts it, and weighing in at 253 pounds (totally fine!) may not be able to compensate. He might need standout 40-yard dash and three-cone times to limit his fall, and even an optimistic view of his athletic profile is more about damage control than potential.\n\nHowell's film is promising. However, his arm length demands that coaches ask how they can mitigate his biggest weakness. Fair or not, that makes him more difficult to take in the top 50.\n\nWinner: Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio State\n\nHe hasn't run yet, but merely being measured has made Styles a winner of the week. At 6'5\", 244 pounds, he has more than enough muscle to make plays in the box. His 71st-percentile arm length stands out on film.\n\nMORE: NFL Combine measurements tracker 2026: Hand size, height, weight and more for Fernando Mendoza, other notables\n\nRemember, this is a former safety. His transition to linebacker went smoothly, and he eradicated his tackling concerns in his platform season. Styles has strong instincts and special movement skills, and in Indianapolis, he proved that he doesn't have to sacrifice physicality in the process.\n\nI expect him to bring the house down when it's time for the 40.\n\nUPDATE: He just posted a 43.5-inch vertical jump. That's the second-best mark for a linebacker since Cameron Wake in 2005 -- a full inch more than the next-best contender. We're shaping up to witness a truly incredible Combine performance.\n\nHe followed that up with a 4.46-second 40-yard dash, the fastest at the position. This was the best Combine a linebacker has had in years, and it might make him the best off-ball prospect since Roquan Smith in 2018.\n\nLoser: Peter Woods, DT, Clemson\n\nWoods entered the season as my top player and an easy selection for DT1. I'll remain higher than consensus, but the calculus has grown increasingly difficult. His 2025 campaign wasn't as impressive as his show-stopping 2024 film, and his pre-draft process hasn't gotten off to a roaring start.\n\nWoods weighed in at 298 pounds, lighter than anticipated and a signal that he might be shedding weight to shed time on his 40-yard dash. Then he didn't run.\n\nLikewise, Woods' arm length came in at 31.25 inches, a fourth-percentile mark for interior linemen. It's not the end of the world, given his ability to shed blocks and find solutions with athleticism. Still, it's an extra point of caution, and he didn't put his athletic prowess on paper.\n\nWinner: Kaleb Proctor, DT, Southeastern Louisiana\n\nProctor wasn't on my radar entering the event. That hasn't stopped him from leaving a mark on Day 1 of drills. Proctor ran a 4.79 40-yard dash with a promising 10-yard split.\n\nThroughout his athletic testing and positional drills, he looked like an easy mover. That bodes well for him to be a Day 3 selection as a rotational pass rusher, having turned his burst into nine sacks this season. Color me intrigued, especially if his 291-pound frame holds up on early downs.\n\nWinner: Malachi Lawrence, EDGE, Central Florida\n\nLawrence put himself on the map in Indianapolis. At 6'4\" and 253 pounds, Lawrence isn't quite as small as the class's most burst-dependent edge rushers. Still, he put on a show, setting the tone with a 40-inch vertical jump and 10'10\" broad jump.\n\n.@UCF_Football EDGE Malachi Lawrence:\n\n- 6'4\", 253 pounds\n- 40\" vertical jump\n- 10'10\" broad jump\n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPluspic.twitter.com/MopTX0d9eX\n\nHe didn't stop there. His first run was 4.53 seconds, trailing only David Bailey (4.51) at edge rusher (for first attempts). He'll have upward momentum during the pre-draft circuit, especially if he continues to move well during positional drills.\n\nLoser: LT Overton, EDGE, Alabama\n\nOne player who didn't move all that well was Alabama's LT Overton. It's important not to double-count these Combine drills for guys that test as expected.\n\nHowever, Overton was a bit slimmer than anticipated at 274 pounds. Even so, his 4.91 40-yard dash was tied for the slowest mark on the edge. It's hard to see Overton making a living as a sack artist at the next level; his run defense is his calling card. If he doesn't have the size to pull that off, Overton may lack the juice to be a starter on Sundays.\n\nFortunately, he moved a little better during positional drills to mitigate concerns.\n\nWinner: David Bailey, EDGE, Texas Tech\n\nBailey didn't test like a generational freak, but he was still able to run a 4.51 40-yard dash to lead the position. He's doing his part to put minor movement concerns to rest, and the rest of his athletic markers were promising.\n\nHis 1.62 10-yard split was impressive, and his 35-inch vert and 10'9\" broad jump help insulate his profile. He also came in a little bigger than some expected, crossing the 250-pound threshold with 33.75-inch arms. This event was more about solidifying his stock than improving it. Bailey checked the necessary boxes to be a top-15 pick.\n\nWinner: TJ Parker, EDGE, Clemson\n\nParker was a prospect that fared unfavorably on my preseason board. The top-five hype was always rich, but as an early Day 2 selection, he has room to make some noise at the next level.\n\nPart of that equation is Parker's ability to convert speed to power. Running a 4.68 40-yard dash at 263 pounds is impressive and an indictment of his best pass-rushing trait. With the size to stick on early downs and fun flashes as a pass rusher, sneaking into Round 1 is possible, even if his stock tumbled with Clemson's playoff aspirations.\n\nLoser: R Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma\n\nR Mason Thomas talked a big game about his speed making up for perceived physical deficiencies. At 241 pounds, Thomas needs truly elite burst to compensate. Being a dynamic edge rusher has staying power on early downs if the ability to wreak havoc outweighs concerns against the run.\n\nInstead, Thomas slipped on his first run on the way to a 4.67 time. On his second opportunity, he was even slower, logging a 4.72-second 40-yard dash. It's a legitimately concerning mark that makes a strong Pro Day performance necessary. A bad day in Indianapolis doesn't have to kill his stock, but it means his work is cut out for him.\n\nLoser: Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami\n\nI'm not convinced this stint will impact his draft stock; the teams that like Bains will like him regardless of arm length. He's a nuanced pass rusher who solves problems to overcome his length issues, and he has a proven track record of producing and rising in big games.\n\nYet, Bain measured in at 263 pounds. That helps inform us that he intends to play outside full-time at the next level, rather than splitting time along the interior because of his lack of length. And reader, the length is indeed lacking. At 30 7/8\", he's operating as an outlier, prompting damage-control tweets and an extended look at his profile.\n\nIt would have been nice if Bain showed off his elite movement skills by testing or doing positional drills. We'll have to wait for his pro day, raising the stakes for an impressive performance.\n\nWinner: Gracen Halton, DT, Oklahoma\n\nThere's a growing need for pass-rushing defensive tackles, and Halton entered the Combine as a rotational asset with passing-down upside. He made a strong argument to be a Day 2 pick on Thursday with an elite showing.\n\nHalton posted the third-best vertical jump (36.5 inches) for defensive tackles since 1999, and he was also the third-quickest lineman at 4.82 seconds. More than just a burst-first tackle, Halton showed off a well-rounded athletic profile that included a handful of exciting positional drills.\n\nKyle Louis faced a familiar challenge for undersized linebackers -- ensuring his athleticism carved out a role on passing downs. It's safe to say he locked that down in Indianapolis.\n\nLouis had the fourth-best vertical (39.5 inches) and second-best broad (10'9\") jumps at the linebacker position. He won't outshine Styles, but backed by a 4.54-second 40-yard dash, there's more than enough dynamism in his profile.\n\nWinner: Arvell Reese, LB, Ohio State\n\nTesting as a linebacker, Reese needed to quiet the (few) contracting voices about his athleticism, largely based on the idea that he needs to be an elite athlete if he's going to transition to edge rusher full-time.\n\nOn Thursday, he showed off the same burst that quarterbacks saw when they were trying to scramble against Ohio State's defense. He posted a 4.46 unofficial 40-yard dash, meeting the moment. We'll see how he looks in positional drills, but it was a strong, if underrated, performance.\n\nLoser: Justin Jefferson, LB, Alabama\n\nIt would be hyperbolic to suggest that Jefferson had a bad set of drills. He posted a 4.57-second 40-yard dash, a 38.5-inch vertical, and a 10'5\" broad jump -- totally respectable times.\n\nHowever, athleticism was Jefferson's calling card at Alabama. Daniel Jeremiah even added on the broadcast that he could compete with the other Justin Jefferson on the 40-yard track, as he was among the fastest players on the field for Crimson Tide game days.\n\nInstead, Jefferson slightly fell short of expectations, generating good, but not great, athleticism scores and losing ground in what looks like an exceptionally athletic (and deep) crop of linebackers.\n\nWhy is Jordyn Tyson skipping NFL Combine workouts?\n\nFive measurements to look forward to at the NFL Combine\n\nTop snubs from the 2026 NFL Combine\n\nFive best fits for Ohio State safety Caleb Downs",

    "fullText": "Quinn Fordham Gray Sr. has added another assistant to his inaugural Florida A&M football coaching staff.\n\nOne that’s familiar to Tallahassee and Miami Dolphins fanatics.\n\nSam Madison Jr. is the Rattlers’ new cornerbacks coach. It was the position he played in the National Football League for 12 seasons from 1997 to 2008, nine with the Dolphins and three with the New York Giants.\n\n“Who else would you rather coach your corners? To have him as a part of the staff brings a wealth of knowledge and different experiences,” Gray told the Tallahassee Democrat at FAMU’s spring football practice on Thursday, Feb. 25.\n\n“He’s coached on the NFL and college level. His playing experience as well is going to lean towards giving these kids what they need from a standpoint of playing the position.”\n\nMadison appeared at Wednesday, Feb. 25’s 220 Quarterback Club luncheon with Gray and his FAMU football assistants.\n\nMadison was a four-time Pro Bowler and All-Pro selection, all with the Dolphins, while playing opposite of Patrick Surtain Sr., Florida State’s former defensive backs coach.\n\nIn 1999, he was the NFL’s co-leader in interceptions, picking off opposing quarterbacks seven times. He shared the honor with James Hasty (Kansas City Chiefs), Troy Vincent (Philadelphia Eagles), and Rod Woodson (Baltimore Ravens).\n\nMadison, 51, was a starter for the 2007-2008 season’s Super Bowl champions, the Giants, who pulled off a 17-14 upset against the undefeated Tom Brady-led New England Patriots in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nBefore his award-winning NFL career, Madison had already been intertwined with the Orange and Green. The Monticello native starred on the football field for the FAMU Developmental Research School Baby Rattlers. He was also a letterman for basketball, baseball, and track and field.\n\nMadison’s football talents landed him a scholarship to play at the University of Louisville, where he became, where he became an All-American talent during his four-year stint from 1992-1996. He’s a member of the Louisville Cardinals’ Ring of Honor.\n\nThe Dolphins picked Madison in the second round, 44th overall, of the 1997 NFL Draft. He was inducted into the franchise’s Walk of Fame in 2014.\n\nMadison has NFL coaching experience as a secondary and cornerbacks coach for the Kansas City Chiefs from 2019 to 2021. He was a staff member when the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 31-20 in Super Bowl LIV at Miami Gardens’ Hard Rock Stadium to conclude the 2019-2020 NFL season.\n\nMadison also spent 2022 to 2023 on the Dolphins staff as a cornerbacks coach and pass game specialist.\n\n“To be able to add a coach of that quality at this point is nothing short of amazing,” Gray said of FAMU’s new cornerbacks coach. “We’re happy to have him and looking forward to the work he’s going to put in.”\n\nFAMU football completed its second day of spring football training camp under first-year head coach Gray on Thursday. The Rattlers’ annual Orange and Green Spring Game is scheduled for Friday, April 3, at 6 p.m. on Ken Riley Field at Bragg Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe 2026 regular season begins when the Rattlers host the Albany State Golden Rams at Bragg on Aug. 29.\n\nQuinn Fordham Gray Sr., Head Coach\n\nToriano Morgan, Assistant Head Coach, Running Backs Coach, High School Recruiting Coordinator\n\nNicholas Sewak, Co-Offensive Coordinator and Offensive Line Coach\n\nRyan Lewis Sr., Defensive Coordinator and Linebackers Coach\n\nElijah Haggard, Special Teams Coordinator and Interior Defensive Line Coach\n\nReid Sanders, Quarterbacks Coach\n\nRon Dugans, Wide Receivers Coach and Pro Scout Liaison\n\nCasey Warming, Tight Ends Coach and Transfer Portal-Junior College Recruiting Coordinator\n\nDahon Mixon, Defensive Ends Coach\n\nSam Madison Jr., Cornerbacks Coach\n\nChris Cash, Safeties and Nickelbacks Coach\n\nMikey Victor, Defensive Quality Control and Nickelbacks Coach\n\nOrlando McKinley Jr., Assistant Special Teams Coach and Defensive Backs Coach\n\nNay'Ron Jenkins, Defensive Graduate Assistant\n\nBrian Norris Jr., Defensive Graduate Assistant\n\nBilly Rolle, Player Development and Director of High School Relations\n\nKennedy Marshall, Director of On-Campus Recruiting\n\nDavid Eggleston, Recruiting Graduate Assistant\n\nBrendan Deanda, Student Offensive Assistant\n\nGerald Thomas, III is a multi-time award-winning journalist for his coverage of the Florida A&M Rattlers at the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nFollow his award-winning coverage on RattlerNews.com and contact him via email at GDThomas@Tallahassee.com or on the app formerly known as Twitter @3peatgee.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tallahassee Democrat: FAMU football's Quinn Gray hires Sam Madison to staff, former NFL star",

    "fullText": "Jeff Walz once joked that his Louisville women’s basketball team enjoys silencing crowds more than energizing them.\n\nThe 11th-ranked Cardinals (25-5, 15-2 ACC) have quieted plenty of crowds this season, doling out home loss after loss to each opponent. For the first time in program history, Louisville has gone undefeated in true road games after beating Georgia Tech, 69-50, on Thursday night in Atlanta.\n\nAfter facing two top-25 teams at home and another at a neutral site, the Cardinals recorded their first ranked win of the season at North Carolina, ranked 11th at the time, on Dec. 14. Getting road wins at N.C. State, Syracuse and Notre Dame were also critical to the Cardinals securing the No. 2 seed in the ACC Tournament and garnering the 9-0 road mark. Taj Roberts was ruled a gametime decision after suffering a Grade 2 ankle sprain against Virginia on Sunday but remained in the starting lineup. She played 37 minutes and finished with 12 points, four rebounds and two assists against the Yellow Jackets (12-17, 7-10).\n\nThe Cardinals had a 20-point scorer in six of the nine road games. Forward Elif Istanbulluoglu was two points shy of her second 20-point road performance of the season with a team-leading 18 points while shooting 50% from the field after scoring 23 points against Miami on Jan. 8.\n\nForward Laura Ziegler had 22 point-performances at Syracuse and Stanford. But she got in foul trouble against the Yellow Jackets and finished with four points, three assists and two rebounds.\n\nThe Cardinals upped its defensive intensity and forced Georgia Tech into 15 first-half turnovers and scored 20 points off the Yellow Jackets’ mistakes. In less than a minute midway through the second quarter, GT turned the ball over four times, giving way to the Cardinals’ 28-18 lead via a 6-0 run.\n\nThe Cardinals finished with 27 points off 22 Georgia Tech turnovers.\n\nLouisville returns home for the regular-season finale to play Notre Dame at 4 p.m. Sunday. UofL has a chance to sweet the Fighting Irish in the regular-season series for the first time since the 2021-22 season.\n\nReach Louisville football, women's basketball and baseball beat writer Alexis Cubit at acubit@gannett.com and follow her on X at @Alexis_Cubit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Louisville women's basketball score, UofL WBB wins at Georgia Tech",

    "description": "Both Illinois and Indiana advanced their respective bills in an effort to lure the Chicago Bears out of the city.",
    "fullText": "Both Illinois and Indiana advanced their respective bills in an effort to lure the Chicago Bears out of the city.\n\nThe House Public Finance Committee advanced the bill Thursday that would freeze property taxes for mega projects like a Bears stadium in Arlington Heights.\n\nBut members of the Illinois House of Representatives adjourned without voting on the bill.\n\nThey will not return to Springfield until March 18.\n\nThe state has thus far failed to commit to infrastructure improvements and property tax certainty. And the Bears have not committed to where they want the team to go.\n\nAn amendment from Chicago-area state Rep. Kam Buckner outlines tax breaks on infrastructure the state would provide to entice the Bears to build in Arlington Heights, where the McCaskey family already owns the old Arlington Racetrack.\n\n\"I do you want the team to stay in Illinois. That's very important to me,\" Buckner said.\n\nIllinois lawmakers say they're not in competition with Indiana. They say they are moving at their own pace.\n\n\"We're operating in our lane, and I think the Bears will see we are moving in the right direction,\" Buckner said.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker spoke about the battle over the Bears on MS NOW.\n\n\"I am not going to be shaken down, and I have set out some very clear guidelines. And my guidelines are we are not going to fleece the taxpayers of the state of Illinois. We are not going to let the Bears do that,\" Pritzker said.\n\nThe full House needs to approve the bill before Pritzker would sign it.\n\nArlington Heights residents and some Bears fans showed up in Springfield Thursday.\n\n\"The Bears belong in Illinois, period. George Stanley Halas would be turning over in his grave if he knew they would even get out of the city of Chicago let alone the state of Illinois,\" Bears fan Marty Tadla said. \"It's the pride and joy of Illinois, Chicago Bears on the lakefront.\"\n\nSome opponents disagree, however. They believe the bill would be bad for taxpayers.\n\n\"This is likely the riskiest economic development program ever seriously propose, not just in Illinois history but in U.S. history,\" said Brian Costin, with Americans for Prosperity.\n\nThe revised mega-project bill was supposed to be heard last week, but got canceled at the last minute.\n\nArlington Heights Mayor Jim Tinaglia said in a statement, \"Thank you to our State Leadership, the Chicago Bears, and all of the local and regional partners who helped the Mega Projects Bill reach this important milestone. Based on the feedback we are receiving, we are very optimistic that the necessary support will be present for the Bill to pass both the Senate and House and advance to the Governor's desk in the coming weeks. We look forward to continuing our work with the team and state leadership to advance this project. Let's stay focused and keep our Pride and Joy in Illinois!\"\n\nChicago's chief financial officer was on hand Thursday to throw a \"Hail Mary\" pass to try to get Chicago back into the consideration. But it seemed to fall incomplete.\n\n\"This is a wake up call. Chicago is losing them. They're not even in the running anymore. This is between the burbs and another state,\" said Li Arellano, a Republican representing Dixon.\n\nIn Indiana, the state Senate passed a bill for a new Chicago Bears stadium in Hammond near Wolf Lake, 45-4.\n\n\"In Lake County, when one city rises, the entire region rises. This legislation positions Indiana, not as a spectator in economic competition, but as a contender,\" said state Sen. Mark Spencer, a Democrat representing Gary, Indiana.\n\nGov. Mike Braun said on X Thursday afternoon he signed the bill.\n\nWe made it clear from the beginning that Indiana is open for business. I’m thrilled to sign Senate Bill 27 to create the framework to build a new world-class stadium in Northwest Indiana. Now let’s get this across the goal line. pic.twitter.com/XTRFVTf1yl\n\n— Governor Mike Braun (@GovBraun) February 26, 2026\n\n\"We made it clear from the beginning that Indiana is open for business. I'm thrilled to sign Senate Bill 27 to create the framework to build a new world-class stadium in Northwest Indiana,\" he said. \"Now let's get this across the goal line.\"\n\nHammond Mayor Thomas M. McDermott Jr. said, \"I want to congratulate Governor Braun for signing into law Senate Bill 27 that sets up the framework to bring the Chicago Bears to Hammond and Northwest Indiana. This is a historic day for our state. The Bears have witnessed over the past several months how efficient government works. From the statehouse to city hall, Indiana continues to be ready to get to work and make Northwest Indiana the Bears new home.\"\n\n\"We would be honored to welcome the McCaskey family and Mr. Ryan to our partnership here,\" said Indiana state Sen. Ryan Mishler, a Republican representing Mishawaka.\n\nThe city of Chicago is still technically in the running to keep the Bears.\n\nThe Bears said in a statement, \"Indiana has taken important steps over the last few months, and we are grateful for the leadership reflected by Governor Braun signing SB 27, establishing the framework for a stadium development in Northwest Indiana. We continue to work on the necessary due diligence and appreciate the ongoing engagement with Indiana state and local leaders.\"",

    "fullText": "The NFL is a copycat league. And there's an emerging trend that one new head coach believes will soon be copied.\n\nBrowns coach Todd Monken has a prediction: There will be more downfield laterals.\n\n\"I do think that laterals are going to be a bigger part of our game,\" Monken said during a Wednesday appearance on PFT Live. \"I believe that you get these zone looks. Now, you've got to throw it to the guy you trust, because you don't want that damn thing on the ground. But I do think that is going to become more and \n\nMonken believes it won't be something that happens only in specific situations.\n\n\"Not just on third downs, not just on fourth down, not just as a gimmick play,\" Monken said. \"Obviously, Ben [Johnson] started doing that a lot in Detroit. Give credit where credit's due. And then others have started to do that a little bit more. And it takes some stones to do it. If the ball ends up on the ground, you're gonna get critiqued for it, but I can see the game going that way, where plays have built-in laterals. It just feels like it can go that way.\"\n\nIt's an effective way to counter a defense's pursuit of the ball and, if/when the defense is bracing for it, to get the defense a little wobbly and uncertain.\n\nStill, as Monken said, execution will be critical. A bad lateral potentially becomes a lost possession, followed by public and private questions as to the sanity of the coach who called the play.",

    "fullText": "Day 1 of on-the-field workouts at the 2026 NFL Combine saw Zane Durant and Dani Dennis-Sutton go through their auditions, and it’s safe to say it was a strong one for both players.\n\nDurant was up first with the interior defensive linemen, and he showed off with an impressive 33.5-inch vertical (tied for third best for DTs) and an official 4.75 forty time at a confirmed 290 pounds.\n\nBuckle up.@PennStateFball DT Zane Durant sprinted for a 4.76u \n\n2026 NFL Combine on @nflnetwork\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/IrpOEJnHji\n\nThe 4.75 forty time for was the best time for a defensive tackle in the 2026 class, and it comes in as tied for the 4th best time by a DT since 2013. Only Adetomiwa Adebawore (4.49 — 4th round pick, 2023), Calijah Kancey (4.67 — 1st round pick, 2023), and Aaron Donald (4.69 — ugh you know him, 2014) had better forty times for interior defensive lineman prospects. All those guys were listed in the 280s — Adebawore 282, Kancey 281, and Donald 285 — where as Durant was 290 flat.\n\nDoes that mean Durant will go in the first round like Donald or Kancey? Not likely, at all. Durant was good at Penn State, especially as a junior, but his production was not on par with either of those Pitt guys. Kancey had 14.5 sacks and 27.5 TFLs his last two seasons in college, and Donald had 16.5 sacks and 47 (!!!!) TFLs his last two. Comparatively, Durant had just 7 sacks and 15.5 TFLs. And sure, the Big Ten in 2024 and 2025 was steeper competition than the Big East and ACC were back then, but that’s a big gap in raw production. Still, this was an overwhelmingly good day for Durant, who probably puts himself more squarely in the 4th round area and maybe could even sneak into the 3rd round.\n\nAs for DDS, it was a banner day. As you can see from the Dane Brugler tweet below, but DDS was one of the big winners from the defensive end group.\n\nDani Dennis-Sutton had a really nice day:\n\n4.63 40\n1.63 10\n39.5 vert\n10'11\" broad jump\n6.90 3-cone (!!)\n\n6-6, 256 pounds, 33 1/2\" arms, 10 1/8\" hands\n\n— Dane Brugler (@dpbrugler) February 27, 2026\n\nHis 40 time was 6th for a defensive end. His vertical was 4th. His broad jump was 1st. His 3-cone was first. And he did it at a shade under 6’6 and coming in at 256 pounds — which is a little on the lighter side for DDS, but it’s around the 260-ish he usually plays us.\n\nDDS was pretty squarely in the Day 2 (rounds 2-3) mix heading into today, and I think he cemented his floor as a Day 2 guy and might have opened up the possibility to sneak into the first round. He has great size, confirmed elite athletic ability, and solid production totaling 17 sacks and 25 TFLs the last two years.",

General manager Dan Morgan and head coach Dave Canales received high grades as well—at an 'A' and 'A-,' respectively.\n\nCarolina's lowest grade, an 'F,' belongs to their home game field.

    "fullText": "It took a while, but Day 1 of NFL Combine workouts in Indianapolis got fun by the end. In particular, one position group more than any other looks like one the Bears should definitely dip into, and it might not be the one you think.\n\n1. I’m good on Kayden McDonald at No. 25.\n\nOne should never put too much stock into the Underwear Olympics when it comes to moving players up or down in the Combine. In the end, your resume is the tape.\n\nThat said, I feel like McDonald’s on-field workout revealed something he himself has hinted at in interviews with reporters: he’s more of a pure run-stopping 3-4 nose tackle than a 4-3 tackle at either the 1- or 3-technique.\n\nWhile he has the short-area quickness and strength you want inside, you can almost see the lack of versatility in his game when you watch him move. He simply doesn’t have the juice to consistently rush the passer, which you can see in his production (three total sacks in college). There’s something to be said for being REALLY good at your role, and McDonald certainly is that when it comes to stopping the run.\n\nBut if the Bears are still in the market for a defensive tackle at No. 25, I’d look at Lee Hunter over McDonald. Hunter’s the more complete player of the two, and is one of the few guys in this class you cannot single-block either in the run game or the pass game. If you do, he inevitably wins.\n\nI might even suggest waiting until the second round and look for guys like Christen Miller (Georgia) or Dontay Corleone (Cincinnati) if the value seems right.\n\nMcDonald will likely be solid at what he does in the NFL, especially in a system that fits his skills. I’m just not sure that system belongs to the Bears.\n\n2. T.J. Parker is not making it to the Bears.\n\nThroughout the week, I’ve heard from draft experts and scouts that the Clemson product was going to go earlier than Bears fans would want him to, despite some mocks and big boards suggesting he might be an option at No. 25. After the workout he just put together in Indianapolis, you can kiss any dreams of that goodbye.\n\nT.J. Parker is a DE prospect in the 2026 draft class. He scored an unofficial 9.33 RAS out of a possible 10.00. This ranked 138 out of 2046 DE from 1987 to 2026.\n\nSplits projected, all times unofficial, agilities left to run, bench tomorrow.https://t.co/v7lww9nouW pic.twitter.com/5LTupv1Slq\n\n— RAS.football (@MathBomb) February 26, 2026\n\nWe knew he was strong and had the baseline frame Dennis Allen might want a 4-3 defensive end. His speed (4.68 seconds in the 40) tore the track up, and his solid 34-inch vertical affirmed his explosiveness at 6-3.5, 263 pounds.\n\nAgain, though, these numbers only confirm what he’s already shown on tape, as he ranked 56th in total pressures last year among 853 qualified edge rushers. After that first set of edge rushers—Arvell Reese, David Bailey, and Rueben Bain Jr.—come off the board, Parker will likely be next.\n\nIf I were the Bears, I’d be looking for later options at edge and looking to bolster that position a different way. Because guys like Zion Young and Cashius Howell, who ran well but simply isn’t long or twitchy enough to be in play, aren’t likely to be the best players available at No. 25.\n\n3. The Bears will dip into this linebacker class.\n\nIt seems like the linebackers just get faster every year. Not a single one of these guys ran a 4.7s 40 or worse, and three players—Reese, Sonny Styles, and Kaleb Elarms-Orr—ran under 4.5. Obviously, the Bears will have no shot at taking those first two guys, who likely both will go in the top 10. But expect the Bears to do a lot of homework on this group after the day they collectively put together.\n\nAfter all, Chicago’s linebacker position is only slightly less problematic than the safety position this year due to impending losses—Tremaine Edmunds will be cut, Amen Ogbongbemiga has been cut, T.J. Edwards and Noah Sewell are injured and face long recoveries, Ruben Hyppolite II barely played, and DeMarco Jackson is a free agent/has made four career starts.\n\nExpect the Bears to sign some more veteran talent at linebacker to steady the ship and grab another linebacker either late on Day 2 or early on Day 3. They suffered too much from decimation at this position not to invest in it this year.",

The feature takes the load off your device using its own cloud-based computer and browser, allowing it to handle a variety of jobs ranging from scheduling appointments to generating study plans while you do something else.\n\nAs noted by Microsoft, you can describe what you need to Copilot Tasks using natural language, and assign Copilot Tasks to complete jobs on a recurring, scheduled, or one-time basis.

Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nCopilot Tasks appears to be Microsoft’s response to the agentic AI capabilities launched in recent months, including Claude Cowork, ChatGPT Agent Mode, Perplexity Computer, and the Gemini-powered “auto-browse” feature in Google Chrome.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you.

    "description": "OpenClaw is a hot topic at the moment. But what is it and how can you use the 24/7 AI assistant in a safe way?",
    "fullText": "An AI tool with a funny name has caused quite a commotion as of late—including some allegations of machine consciousness—so here is a breakdown on OpenClaw.\n\nLaunched in November 2025, OpenClaw is an open-source, autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agent that was made to run locally on your own computer, allowing it to manage tasks, interact with applications, and read and write files directly. It acts as a personal digital assistant, integrating with chat apps like WhatsApp and Discord to automate emails, scan calendars, and browse the internet for information.\n\nOpenClaw was formerly known as ClawdBot, but the project brushed up against the large AI developer Anthropic, because of its own tool named “Claude.” In response, OpenClaw’s developer quickly renamed the project to “Moltbot,” which brought impersonation campaigns from cybercriminals. The trademark trouble and the abuse that followed put a dent in OpenClaw’s reputation.\n\nAnother dent followed when Hudson Rock published an article about the first observed case of an infostealer grabbing a complete OpenClaw configuration from an infected system, effectively looting the “identity” of a personal AI agent rather than just browser passwords.\n\nThe case underlines an impending danger—and not just for OpenClaw, but for other AI agents as well. Infostealers are starting to harvest not just credentials but entire AI personas plus their cryptographic “skeleton keys,” turning one compromised agent into a pivot point for full‑blown account takeover and long‑term profiling.\n\nAs I stated before in a broader context, adversaries are starting to target AI systems at the supply‑chain level, quietly poisoning training data and inserting backdoors that only surface under specific conditions. OpenClaw sits squarely in this emerging risk zone: open source, moving fast, and increasingly wired into mailboxes, cloud drives, and business workflows while its security model is still being improvised.\n\nAt this stage of its development, treating OpenClaw as a hardened productivity tool is wishful thinking, since it behaves more like an over‑eager intern with an adventurous nature, a long memory, and no real understanding of what should stay private.\n\nResearchers and regulators have already documented prompt injection risks, log poisoning, and exposed instances that hand attackers plaintext credentials or tokens via poisoned emails, websites, or logs that the agent dutifully processes.\n\nFor anyone thinking about using OpenClaw in production, the bigger picture is even less comforting. OpenClaw runs locally but is designed to be adventurous: it can browse, run shell commands, read and write files, and chain “skills” together without a human checking every step. Misconfigured permissions, over‑privileged skills, and a culture of “just give it access so it can help” mean the agent often sits at the center of your accounts, tokens, and documents, with very few guardrails.\n\nIn fact, an employee at Meta who works in AI safety and alignment recently shared on the social media platform X that she was unable to prevent ClawBot from deleting a major portion of her email inbox.\n\nFurther, the Dutch data protection authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) warned organizations not to deploy experimental agents like OpenClaw on systems that handle sensitive or regulated data at all, flagging the combination of privileged local access, immature security engineering, and a rapidly growing ecosystem of dubious third‑party plugins as a kind of Trojan horse on the endpoint.\n\nMicrosoft provided a list of recommendations in this field that make a lot of sense. They are not specifically aimed at OpenClaw, but provide a conservative baseline for self‑hosted, Internet‑connected agents with durable credentials. (If these recommendations feel overly technical, it’s because safely using an AI agent with broad access is still an experimental and technical process.)\n\nWe don’t just report on threats—we remove them\n\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

    "fullText": "PwC surveyed 4,454 CEOs across 95 countries and asked them one simple question: is AI actually making you money?\n\n56% of CEOs — more than half — report zero financial impact from AI. No revenue gains. No cost savings. Nothing.\n\nOnly 12% — one in eight — have successfully used AI to both cut costs and grow revenue.\n\nThese aren't small businesses with no budget. These are the world's largest corporations, sitting on billions in capital, entire AI teams, and enterprise software contracts that cost more per month than most solo founders make in a year.\n\nPwC calls it something diplomatically understated: they say companies are running \"isolated, tactical AI projects\" that \"often don't deliver measurable value.\" The blunter term for what's happening is Pilot Purgatory — a place where AI gets used enough to feel like progress, but never deeply enough to create results.\n\nHere's the thing. If you're a solo founder watching this play out from the sidelines, this isn't discouraging. It's the biggest competitive window you've had in years. And most people aren't looking at it that way.\n\nBig companies don't fail at AI because of bad intentions. They fail because of structure.\n\nHere's what actually happens inside a large enterprise that wants to implement AI:\n\nA team identifies an opportunity. They write a brief. Legal reviews it. IT assesses integration risk. A pilot gets approved with a capped budget. The pilot runs for a quarter, produces mixed results (because every pilot does), gets reviewed by a committee, and then — if it's lucky — gets approved for \"further exploration.\"\n\nPwC's report is refreshingly direct about the root cause. The companies that aren't seeing results are treating AI as a tactical add-on — they're bolting it onto existing workflows rather than rebuilding workflows around it. They're using AI to marginally speed up what they already do, instead of using it to do things they couldn't do before.\n\nThe report calls for \"enterprise-scale deployment consistent with company business strategy\" with \"a clearly defined road map for AI initiatives.\" Which is exactly what bureaucracy makes nearly impossible to execute.\n\nThe term that matters here, and the one you should remember, is the difference between using a tool and building a system.\n\nAlmost everyone — 56% of the world's biggest CEOs included — is using tools.\n\nA handful of winners are building systems. That distinction is what separates the 12% from everyone else.\n\nPwC identifies the successful 12% with a specific label: the Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard aren't just using better tools. They've deployed AI differently — across more of their business, and specifically in the parts of the business that touch revenue, not just cost.\n\nHere's the number that matters: 44% of Vanguard companies apply AI directly to their products, services, and customer experiences. Among the remaining 88% stuck in Pilot Purgatory, only 17% do this.\n\nRead that again. The winners are almost 3x more likely to be using AI in what they actually sell — not just in how they operate internally.\n\nThis reveals a pattern that makes complete sense once you see it:\n\nThe average company uses AI to write internal emails, summarize meeting notes, and maybe help the marketing team generate social posts. It's productive, sure. But it doesn't change what they charge for or how many customers they can serve.\n\nThe Vanguard uses AI in the product itself. They're using it to make their service faster, more personalized, or more scalable. They're using it to reach customers they couldn't reach before, qualify leads more intelligently, or deliver outputs that weren't possible without a much larger team.\n\nThat's where revenue gets generated. Not from automating your inbox.\n\nHere's what the PwC report can't say directly (because it's written for corporate audiences), but what the data implies loudly:\n\nSolo founders are structurally better positioned to join the Vanguard than large enterprises are.\n\nNot because you have more resources. Because you have fewer barriers.\n\nSpeed of implementation. When you identify an automation that could save you 10 hours a week, what's your timeline from decision to deployment? Days. Maybe hours. There's no compliance review, no IT dependency, no cross-functional alignment required. You see it, you build it, you test it, you ship it. A large enterprise running the same decision through its normal process would still be in the committee stage six months later.\n\nFull-stack integration. In a large company, the marketing team uses a different system than the sales team, which uses a different system than the support team — and getting those systems to talk to each other requires months of IT work and often a six-figure integration project.\n\nAs a solo founder, you are the full stack. Your marketing AI, your sales AI, and your operations tools can be connected in an afternoon. You don't need permission from three departments to build a workflow that crosses functional lines.\n\nNo legacy infrastructure to protect. Large companies built their operations on systems that predate AI by decades. Retrofitting AI into those systems is genuinely hard — it requires changing processes that have calcified over years, retraining people who've developed habits around old tools, and managing the political risk of disrupting what's currently working. You don't have that problem. You can build clean.\n\nAlignment between decision and execution. PwC notes that the Vanguard requires \"an organisational culture that enables AI adoption.\" In a solo operation, you are the culture. You don't need to convince a skeptical executive team. You don't need to manage change across departments. When you decide to commit, you're committed.\n\nThe CEOs in PwC's survey spend nearly half their time — 47% — on issues with a time horizon of less than one year. They're trapped managing immediate problems, which leaves less time for the transformation work that actually moves the needle.\n\nYou have a choice they don't. You can decide today to spend time on building, not just managing.\n\nThere's a phrase worth coining here: the AI Execution Gap.\n\nIt's the space between companies that are experimenting with AI and companies that are deploying it at the level that actually produces results. Right now, that gap is enormous. Only 12% of the world's most sophisticated, best-resourced companies have crossed it.\n\nBut crossing it isn't about having more resources. The PwC data makes that clear. It's about how you deploy AI, not how much you spend on it.\n\nThe Vanguard companies share three characteristics that you can replicate right now, at any budget level:\n\nThey build foundations, not experiments. They don't test AI on a one-off project and walk away when results are mixed. They build the infrastructure — the integrations, the workflows, the data pipelines — that makes AI useful across everything they do. For you, this means setting up systems that run continuously, not trying AI once for a specific task and concluding it \"didn't work.\"\n\nThey apply AI where revenue lives. Vanguard companies put AI into their products and their customer acquisition, not just their back-office admin. For solo founders, this means using AI to make your core offering better or more scalable — to serve more clients at the same quality, or to charge more for a demonstrably superior result.\n\nThey commit to workflows, not tools. There's a meaningful difference between downloading an AI app and building an AI workflow. A tool does a task. A workflow replaces a process. The goal isn't to use ten AI tools occasionally. It's to have systems that run without you constantly making decisions — so your business keeps moving even when your attention is elsewhere.\n\nThe PwC report tells you what separates the winners from the rest. Here's how to apply it as a solo founder, starting this week.\n\nThe 26% of companies seeing cost savings from AI aren't doing anything exotic. They're identifying the repetitive, time-consuming tasks that eat their hours — admin, scheduling, data entry, first-draft content, support triage — and replacing them with AI workflows.\n\nYour version of this is straightforward: audit where your time goes for one week. Not where you think it goes — where it actually goes. Every task you do more than twice a week is a candidate for automation. Every task that requires gathering the same type of information repeatedly is a candidate for automation. Every task that produces a templated output is a candidate for automation.\n\nThe goal isn't to use AI for everything. It's to recover 10-15 hours a week so you can redirect them toward revenue-generating work.\n\n→ AI Ops & Automation: Browse Implementation Guides\n\nThis is where the 12% separate themselves. And it's where most solo founders are leaving money on the table.\n\nAsk yourself: what does AI enable me to deliver that I couldn't deliver before, or couldn't deliver at this price point?\n\nCan you deliver a service faster because AI handles the research and first-draft phase? Can you serve more clients simultaneously because AI handles onboarding and initial support? Can you offer a tier of your product that's AI-augmented and therefore higher-margin? Can you use AI to personalize your offering in a way that commands a premium?\n\nThe Vanguard answer this question and then build for it. They don't just use AI behind the scenes — they make it part of what they're selling.\n\n→ AI Content Creation: Scale Your Output | AI Lead Gen & Outreach: Fill Your Pipeline\n\nThis is the hardest one, because it requires a mindset shift rather than a tool change.\n\nPilot Purgatory isn't just a corporate disease. Solo founders fall into it too — trying an AI tool for two weeks, not seeing transformative results immediately, and moving on to the next one. The result is a collection of tools that don't talk to each other and workflows that are half-automated.\n\nThe shift is this: instead of asking \"what can I try with AI this week?\", ask \"what system can I build this month that will still be running six months from now?\"\n\nThat question points you toward workflows, not experiments. Toward integrations, not demos. Toward the 12% side of the chart.\n\n→ The Solo Founder's Guide Library: Full Roadmap\n\nPwC's 29th Global CEO Survey is nominally about large enterprises. But if you read between the lines, it tells you something specific and actionable about where the real opportunity is.\n\nThe world's biggest companies are in meetings right now trying to figure out AI governance, pilot approval processes, and enterprise-wide alignment frameworks. They'll be in those meetings for most of 2026.\n\nYou don't have to wait for anyone's approval. You don't need a committee to sign off. You don't need a multi-quarter rollout plan.\n\nThe AI Execution Gap is wide open. And unlike the CEOs in PwC's survey, you can start closing it today.\n\nAll statistics cited directly from the published report. Key figures: 56% of CEOs report no revenue or cost benefit from AI; 12% report both; 44% of \"Vanguard\" companies apply AI to products and services vs. 17% of other companies.\n\nHarran Ali is a technical founder, AI systems auditor, and automation architect.

    "description": "Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization.",

    "fullText": "In a surprise deal, Apple and Netflix are teaming up for select Formula 1 programming.\n\nThe deal will include Netflix simulcasting the F1 Canadian Grand Prix May 22-24 (it will also be on Apple TV, of course), and with Apple TV getting streaming rights to season eight of Drive to Survive alongside Netflix.\n\nDrive to Survive will land on Apple TV at midnight tonight, the same day it debuts on Netflix.\n\nEddy Cue, Apple’s senior VP of services, announced the deal in a conference call with reporters Thursday.\n\n“Netflix, I think, has played a pivotal role in growing F1 since the launch of Drive to Survive, and we’re thrilled to make F1 content more broadly available to new and existing u.s. fans on both Netflix and Apple TV,” Cue said.\n\nThe deal delivers something for each company: Apple gets F1 shoulder programming that it can place alongside the live races, and expanded reach for its F1 programming through the Canadian Grand Prix simulcast. Netflix, meanwhile, will get live F1 racing in the U.S. in May, continuing its strategy of frequent live event event programming.\n\nIn fact, the Netflix deal is just one of many efforts that Apple is taking to expand the reach of F1 ahead of the season kickoff next month in Melbourne, Australia. As with its deals with MLB and MLS, Apple will be integrating F1 content and programming within its other apps, including in Apple news (which will offer live look-ins to races), Apple Maps, Apple Music, and its other apps.\n\nAnd the company is striking partnerships with third-parties, in addition to Netflix. As previously reported Imax will simulcast some races, and the company will also partner with Fox’s Tubi to stream some “altcasts,” though it is not entirely clear what that will entail.\n\nApple secured F1 rights last year in a deal believed to be valued at $140-$150 million annually. The racing circuit had been with ESPN with years, crediting the sports giant with growing it tremendously.\n\n“They were the one who bet on us in a moment where there was not really a good confidence that we can grow as we are doing as a sport,” F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali told The Hollywood Reporter last year. ESPN parent company Disney and F1 are still in business, with the companies working on consumer products and online comics, as announced earlier Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Peter Mallouk says his clients are more diversified than ever amid AI's transformative impact on industries.\n\nAI's rise is causing unpredictable bouts of market volatility across stock sectors.\n\nMallouk suggests investors diversify more than before, and avoid trying to rotate too often.\n\nPeter Mallouk, the billionaire CEO of wealth management firm Creative Planning, says AI isn't like any past technology cycle — it's far more transformational, and that calls for investors to take action in their portfolios.\n\nMallouk told Business Insider that he's convinced AI is more impactful than other technological advancements by a long-shot, and the change it creates will likely be permanent.\n\n\"I think it's more than the internet, where the internet made everybody more efficient, or Microsoft with all their tools made everybody more efficient. This is something that removes 95% of the work in some roles. This is going to be truly transformative — like completely transformative.\"\n\nThat realization started to reverberate through financial markets this month, with AI panic hitting various stock sectors and a viral report from Citrini Research driving a sell-off on Monday.\n\nGiven the volatility and AI's unpredictable impacts on the market, Mallouk said that his roughly 3,400 clients worth at least $25 million are spreading their money out more than before.\n\nDiversification is fairly basic advice that you'll hear from most money managers — the more you hedge your bets, the more likely you'll be able to preserve capital.\n\nYet, in today's environment, it's especially important, Mallouk said, as AI disruptions seem to be catching investors off guard everywhere.\n\n\"I think the smart money is more diversified than ever,\" Mallouk said, adding: \"I mean, who would think that in the AI revolution, the big winners in the stock market would be energy and consumer goods? I mean, give me a break. You've got to be diversified.\"\n\nAs Mallouk sees it, being diversified today looks a little different for the average investor than it did in the past. While the traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% allocation to bonds has long been the standard portfolio, Mallouk said he prefers a broader, less conservative approach.\n\nLean more into equities than a 60% allocation, having exposure to both non-US stocks and stocks across all US sectors. Funds that offer exposure to these trades include the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) and the Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (SCHB).",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A representative of the U.S. Attorney’s office testified in federal court on Thursday that the human smuggling case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia was justified while acknowledging that the charges, coming two years after a traffic stop in question was “extraordinary.”\n\nAbrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has galvanized both sides of the immigration debate, claims that the criminal prosecution is vindictive and pushed by officials from President Donald Trump's administration to punish him after they were forced to bring him back to the United States. He wants the charges dismissed.\n\nWhile Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen, a court order from 2019 prevents him from being deported to that country. That's because an immigration judge determined he faced danger in El Salvador from a gang that had threatened his family. Abrego Garcia, 30, immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager but has an American wife and child. He has lived and worked in Maryland for years under the supervision of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nAfter he was deported to El Salvador last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration had to work to bring him back. He was eventually returned to the U.S. only to face criminal charges of human smuggling based on a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nBody camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia after he was pulled over for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nFirst Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire, who was acting U.S. attorney in April 2025, testified that it was his decision to charge Abrego Garcia, and he did so based on the evidence.\n\n“I had previously prosecuted several human smuggling cases,” McGuire testified. When he saw video of the traffic stop, “I was immediately struck by how similar what was being depicted in the body cam was to those investigations.”\n\nAbrego Garcia was carrying nine people in a car without luggage, the car belonged to someone with “a human smuggling background,” and the route was suspicious, among other things, McGuire said.\n\nHe said he was in close contact with the deputy attorney general's office about the investigation's progress but said that was common with high-profile cases.\n\nOn cross-examination, McGuire admitted that the timing of the charges, more than two years after the traffic stop, was “extraordinary.” McGuire said he had not previously been aware of the stop.\n\nHomeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Rana Saoud, who ran the Nashville region at the time of Abrego Garcia’s deportation, testified Thursday that she first heard of the 2022 traffic stop in April 2025, when someone forwarded her a news article in the Tennessee Star, a conservative online publication. Saoud said she was aware of the publicity around Abrego Garcia, who at that point was still in El Salvador.\n\nSaoud testified that she initiated the investigation and was under no pressure from higher-ups.\n\n“If the facts did not add up, we would have ceased to move forward,” she said. “The case just kept getting stronger.”\n\nOn cross-examination, Saoud agreed that the case was not high profile because of the nature of the criminal allegations but because of who the defendant was. “Mr. Abrego was in the news all the time at that point,” she said.\n\nDefense attorney David Patton said that a different HSI office in Baltimore knew of the traffic stop two years earlier but had never charged Abrego Garcia and closed the investigation after his March 2025 deportation. The case was reopened in Baltimore a month later, after the Supreme Court decision on Abrego Garcia’s deportation. By the time McGuire was aware of the traffic stop, federal agents with the Baltimore office had already interviewed the owner of the car Abrego Garcia had been driving.\n\nJose Hernandez Reyes, then incarcerated, told agents he had run a smuggling operation with Abrego Garcia as a driver for him, McGuire said. The same day McGuire learned about the traffic stop from Saoud, Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh emailed him asking to meet about Hernandez Reyes’ testimony.\n\nMcGuire emailed Singh regularly with updates on the indictment's progress. He said he did not know if Singh was sharing those updates with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche or Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n“I can tell you they never came back to say, ‘Put this in there,’ or ‘Say this,’ or ’Don’t say that’,” he testified.\n\nPressed about whether he might have felt pressure to prosecute the case, McGuire said, “I’m not going to do something that I think is wrong to keep my job.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw previously found some evidence that the prosecution against Abrego Garcia, who arrived at the courthouse with his wife Thursday morning, “may be vindictive.” The judge said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.” He cited a statement by Blanche that seemed to suggest the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.\n\nAbrego Garcia's attorneys have been sparring with prosecutors for months over whether officials like Blanche would be required to testify at Thursday's hearing and what emails Department of Justice officials would have to turn over to them. McGuire has argued that he alone made the decision to prosecute, so the motives of other officials were irrelevant.\n\nCrenshaw reviewed many of the disputed documents. In an order that was unsealed in late December, he wrote, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”",

    "description": "\"Each pregnancy is different, but this one felt heavier,\" Sabrina B., a mom of three, tells PEOPLE.",
    "fullText": "A New Jersey mom expected her third pregnancy would require more from her, but she wasn't prepared for the \"frightening\" experience that would come after\n\nSabrina B., a 38-year-old mom of three, tells PEOPLE that welcoming her third baby was the \"hardest\" experience she's had to date, noting she \"felt the difference immediately\"\n\nAfter giving birth, Sabrina received \"shocking and frightening\" news\n\nA New Jersey mom expected her third pregnancy would require more from her, but she wasn't prepared for the \"frightening\" experience that would come after.\n\nSabrina B., a 38-year-old mom of three, tells PEOPLE that welcoming her third baby was the \"hardest\" experience she's had to date, noting she \"felt the difference immediately.\" From the beginning of her pregnancy, Sabrina says she could sense it would \"require more from me physically and emotionally,\" and it proved to be \"challenging.\"\n\n\"The labor itself lasted 16 and a half hours, [which was] my longest by far,\" Sabrina says. \"Beyond the length of labor, it was the overall weight of the season that made it especially challenging. I was pregnant while raising a toddler and an almost preteen, trying to balance motherhood, healing, and everyday life. My body felt exhausted. I felt stretched thin physically and emotionally.\"\n\n\"Each pregnancy is different, but this one felt heavier,\" she adds. \"I was older, more aware of my body, and more attuned to when something didn’t feel right.\"\n\nA week after giving birth to her baby Alijah, Sabrina had a home visit from a postpartum nurse sent through a state-sponsored program. Upon checking her vitals, the nurse noticed that her blood pressure was very high and continuing to rise. In addition, Sabrina says her ankles and feet were visibly swollen.\n\n\"Without hesitation, she pulled out her phone and called my OB-GYN directly,\" she recalls, adding that her nurse's concern pushed her to take the next appointment with her doctor.\n\nBefore her appointment, Sabrina tells PEOPLE her symptoms started to intensify. In addition to her swollen ankles and feet and high blood pressure, she began passing large blood clots. On one occasion, she recalls her body suddenly feeling \"strange,\" like she was about to push out a baby again, while she took a shower.\n\n\"I passed a very large clot and started screaming and crying. It triggered past pregnancy losses I’ve experienced, and in that moment, I truly thought I was dying,\" Sabrina recalls. \"What scared me most wasn’t death itself. It was the thought of leaving my girls without their mother.\"\n\nAt her doctor's appointment, Sabrina tells PEOPLE she received the \"shocking and frightening\" news that she had postpartum preeclampsia. Since then, Sabrina has worked closely with her care team to regulate her condition. She explains that she was placed on blood pressure medication and has taken steroid injections to reduce inflammation.\n\n\"Those first two weeks postpartum, I could barely grip a pen, let alone my baby,\" she says, acknowledging that all the tests and work from her doctors have helped \"stabilize things\" for her over time. \"It’s been a medical journey — one I never expected — but I’m grateful it was caught early.\"\n\nSabrina, who is also a mom to Kameryn, 2, and Kaydence, 12, tells PEOPLE she's ultimately grateful that her daughter was born safely.\n\nDuring this experience, Sabrina was also navigating different nerve issues that left her unable to grip things properly. She says it also caused a tingling and numbness in her hands, making it \"scary\" to hold her baby.\n\n\"Many nights, my partner would pick her up when she cried, change her, and bring her to me to breastfeed because my body felt weak and I literally couldn’t,\" she says, adding that her partner, Arnaldo, 38, really supported her in this challenging moment. \"It required a lot of teamwork. It still does.\"\n\n\"I’m deeply grateful for his support throughout this entire experience,\" she adds. \"We’ve truly leaned on each other in raising our girls, and I don’t take that partnership for granted.\"\n\nSabrina has been sharing her life, especially her postpartum journeys, online publicly for 11 years. However, this time, she says she was different and needed to lean on the community she created.\n\n\"I shared because I genuinely wanted to know if other women had gone through this,\" she explains to PEOPLE. \"I needed hope. I needed reassurance that it gets better, that there are answers [and] that you’re not alone.\"\n\n\"I also wanted to bring awareness to heart disease, particularly among Black and Latina women — communities I am part of,\" she continues. \"Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death in our communities. We often normalize stress, but stress impacts our bodies in real ways. If sharing my story encourages even one woman to check her blood pressure, keep her postpartum appointment, get a second opinion, or listen to her intuition — then it’s worth it.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nLooking back at her birth experience, Sabrina tells PEOPLE she's most grateful for her support system and access to quality health care.\n\n\"I’m most grateful for my support system — my family, my best friend, my village — and for access to doctors who listened and took me seriously,\" she says. \"Healthcare can be expensive and overwhelming, and many women neglect their health because of that.\"\n\n\"I don’t take for granted that I had the resources and support to advocate for myself,\" Sabrina adds. \"And I hope other women know they deserve that too.\"",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Lawyers for student protesters detained in Pennsylvania for four days after a scuffle with police say their clients had no idea the stocky older man in street clothes who joined the fray and put his arm around a 15-year-old girl’s neck was the local police chief.\n\nThe attorneys said the students from Quakertown Community High School who were demonstrating against immigration enforcement policies acted in self-defense and will fight the charges. They include a simple assault charge elevated to aggravated assault, a felony, because the alleged victim is Police Chief Scott McElree.\n\n“He charged from his vehicle into the middle of this group of kids,” defense lawyer Donald Souders said Wednesday. “Many of the kids jumped in, in an attempt to defend her. They assumed that this was a counterprotester.”\n\nThe 72-year-old McElree, the attorneys said, arrived in an unmarked car, had no badge or hat or uniform on, and never identified himself. Videos posted to social media showed the tussle between students and officers.\n\nMcElree, who also serves as the Philadelphia suburb's borough manager, did not return messages left Tuesday and Wednesday at his home and office.\n\n“My client was directly choked by the chief. It was alleged that she had struck him, which she did not,” said lawyer Timothy Prendergast, who represents the petite 15-year-old girl. “They are innocent. They were exercising their First Amendment rights. The chief did not like that and acted outside of his authority.\"\n\nPrendergast's client and at least two others were released Tuesday, some on home confinement with ankle monitors. It was not immediately clear if the other two remained in custody Wednesday. The lawyers did not identify their clients, and juvenile court records are not public.\n\nSome residents have called for McElree to resign. Bucks County District Attorney Joe Khan opened an investigation, while also prosecuting the teens in juvenile court. The defense lawyers questioned whether he could remain impartial in both roles.\n\nAbout 35 students had staged a walkout Friday to protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies when police approached them outside a bakery, about a half-mile from school.\n\nSouders represents a 16-year-old boy who, he said, had his eyeglasses broken as he was knocked into a large planter by a uniformed officer during the scrum. The boy spent the weekend in custody trying to get glass particles out of his eye, and was seen there by a nurse before his father took him to a hospital Tuesday after his release, Souders said.\n\nHigh school administrators had met with the student protesters about the planned walkout, but then withdrew permission on Friday morning out of safety concerns, the acting superintendent said in a statement.\n\nMany in the group are students of color, and some are the children of immigrants, their lawyers said. Both Quakertown, with about 9,300 residents, and the high school, with about 1,650 students, are predominantly white.\n\nAccording to defense lawyers, the students were taunted along the route by another group of students yelling insults, including racial epithets, at them.\n\n“Throughout the protest, the police were following from a distance,” Souders said. “Probably in hindsight, they should have interceded between the protesters and counterprotesters. They were saying really awful things to get the kids riled up.”\n\nHis client, a high school junior who works two restaurant jobs, was released on home confinement with an ankle monitor, he said. He can leave home for school, work, church and other approved activities.\n\nAs juveniles, the teens have a right to an adjudication hearing within 30 days — or 10 days if they are in custody. However, the lawyers expect to seek more time to gather video and other evidence in the case.\n\n“This was an abomination of (police) escalation when it should have been a teaching moment for de-escalation,” said lawyer Ettore “Ed” Angelo, who represents another 15-year-old girl charged and released in the case.",

    "fullText": "Listen and \n\nAnthony Scaramucci quickly exited stage left from his communications role during the Trump 45 administration, but he isn't mincing words.\n\n\"If we could stay the course, not blow ourselves up, [and] have some decent, predictable political policies, the economy will recover,\" the Skybridge Capital founder told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in a new episode of the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast.\n\nIn addition to a short stint during Trump's first term — chronicled in his book \"From Wall Street to the White House and Back\" — Scaramucci's résumé includes an early career at Goldman Sachs before co-founding alternative asset manager Skybridge in 2005.\n\nRecently, markets have wavered amid news related to AI's growing power and Washington's political dysfunction. In D.C., \"unrest and uncertainty\" have become an issue, according to Scaramucci, who added that markets prefer \"evenness, predictability, and stability,\" while the \"on-again, off-again knee-jerking with tariffs is a mistake.\"\n\n\"I think it's hurting the markets,\" he continued. \"We could be doing way better if we had sound policies without capriciousness and uncertainty.\"\n\nThis conversation comes as once popular \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, such as Microsoft (MSFT), are experiencing pullbacks.\n\n\"Twenty stocks are holding up the market,\" Scaramucci said, adding that bitcoin's 50% correction is notable. \"Bitcoin is a leading indicator, so you're probably going to have a lot of roll-off in the stock market.\"\n\nCurrent market performance is also worth a look. Year to date, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) is down 24.43%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has inched up 1% in 2026, the Russell 2000 (RTY=F) is up 6%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is down 1%.\n\nScaramucci sees any market downturn as temporary. \"I don't think it's going to be overly hellish, because you've got a lot of firepower from the Federal Reserve,\" he said.\n\n\"I still think [Fed chair Jerome] Powell, who is a data-dependent guy, will start cutting rates, particularly [if he sees weakness] in the overall marketplace,\" he said.\n\nScaramucci also intends to keep calm and carry on. \"Would I change my investment thesis because of this short-term stuff that's going on?\" he asked. \"I would not, and I would encourage people not to.\"",

    "title": "CoreWeave says Nvidia has its back on data center financing",
    "description": "On a recent call with analysts, CoreWeave said that Nvidia would guarantee its data center lease payments as it confronts huge buildout costs.",
    "fullText": "In a call with analysts late last month, a CoreWeave executive said it will use Nvidia as a guarantor of its lease payments in order to help secure financing for the buildout of data centers it will occupy, an analyst who listened to the call told Business Insider.\n\nAlex Platt, a research analyst at D.A. Davidson who covers CoreWeave, said that a company executive likened the arrangement to a recent guarantee Google had extended to a partner to allow construction financing to be raised for a data center Google will occupy.\n\nThe guarantee of lease payments would be another major line of financial support from Nvidia to help CoreWeave manage the immense costs of building artificial intelligence infrastructure. The chipmaking giant has also purchased billions of dollars of CoreWeave shares and, last year, agreed to buy up to $6.3 billion of CoreWeave computing capacity if CoreWeave is unable to sell it to clients.\n\nCoreWeave's disclosure to analysts that Nvidia would assist in bankrolling its ambitious data center buildout came on the day that the two companies announced that Nvidia had bought $2 billion of CoreWeave stock and would \"accelerate\" CoreWeave's goal of rapidly scaling its artificial intelligence computing portfolio.\n\n\"In addition to continuing to procure our own capacity, CoreWeave will selectively partner with NVIDIA and leverage NVIDIA's financial strength to accelerate our procurement of land, power, shell, to try to better keep pace with demand,\" a spokeswoman for CoreWeave told Business Insider when asked about the analyst call. \"This could take several forms like credit enhancement, joint developments, etc., but will be determined based on the specific opportunity at that point in time.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman added that support from Nvidia or other partners \"should not be interpreted as the primary mechanism through which CoreWeave accesses capacity, nor as an indication that the company is unable to procure infrastructure independently.\"\n\nThe potential lease backstop from Nvidia shows how CoreWeave, a leader in the race to build out AI infrastructure, is marshaling the financial heft of business partners as it confronts immense costs. Moody's has forecast that CoreWeave could spend more than $30 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, more than double its expected outlay in 2025.\n\nPlatt said that the news of Nvidia's deepening commitment had initiated a \"pretty stark shift in sentiment\" among investors.\n\n\"If you were asking me about CoreWeave three months ago, I'd say that sentiment was pretty low,\" Platt said. \"I think now we're actually going to see sentiment around CoreWeave shift drastically to the positive side from investors.\"\n\nLast week, Business Insider reported that efforts in recent months to raise third-party construction financing for a data center that will be leased by CoreWeave in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, had been unsuccessful. Blue Owl, a major lender and investor in the data center development boom, disclosed that it had extended a $500 million short-term loan to the project that expires in March; it did not say how the $4 billion project would be financed beyond that.\n\nA lender familiar with the project's solicitations for construction financing told Business Insider that Blue Owl had been seeking about $1.4 billion in loans.\n\nCoreWeave stock fell after Business Insider's Friday report by as much 12% but has since rebounded.\n\nA CoreWeave spokeswoman told BI after its story was published that the Lancaster project \"is fully funded, under construction, and moving forward as planned.\"\n\n\"It's standard practice for capital allocators to evaluate a range of financing options when managing large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly in high-growth, capital-intensive sectors like AI,\" the spokeswoman said. \"There has been no change to the project's timeline.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if CoreWeave would seek to have Nvidia guarantee some or all of its lease payments to the Lancaster development. Such a backstop from the world's largest publicly traded company would likely make it easier to attract lenders and also potentially reduce borrowing costs based on Nvidia's strong credit rating.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that CoreWeave was arranging $8.5 billion of financing from a group of lenders, including Morgan Stanley and MUFG, based on customer contracts it has with Meta, in another example of how CoreWeave is leveraging its ties to some of the world's wealthiest companies to raise cash.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group declined to comment to Business Insider on the potential financing deal.\n\nPlatt said that a CoreWeave executive on the call said that Nvidia's plans to backstop CoreWeave data centers would be similar to an arrangement Google has with Fluidstack. In September, it was announced that Google would guarantee almost half of Fluidstack's lease payments for a Texas data center that Fluidstack will rent and Google will occupy. Like CoreWeave, Fluidstack is a so-called neo-cloud company that procures, builds, and operates AI infrastructure and computing and then leases it to customers.\n\nCoreWeave announces its fourth-quarter earnings for 2025 on Thursday. The rate at which it is spending money on AI infrastructure and the growth of its portfolio will be two closely watched measures of whether the company is scaling at the rate it has forecast to capitalize on the huge market opportunity it has touted.\n\nThe company previously stated it would end 2025 with 850 megawatts of operating data center facilities, according to a January research report by Deutsche Bank. A Morgan Stanley report on February 20 stated that \"easing investor concerns\" would depend, in part, on delivering that capacity. CoreWeave had 590 megawatts of power online at the end of the third quarter, according to Morgan Stanley. The report projects that CoreWeave's debt will grow to $38 billion by the end of 2026 as it spends to build. At the end of the third quarter, the company reported roughly $14 billion of debt at an average interest rate of around 10%.\n\nWhile CoreWeave's mounting debt has highlighted the risks involved in the AI buildout, the company has said that's outweighed by the huge revenues it will generate from the facilities it leases and builds out. At the end of the third quarter, the company reported a $55.6 billion backlog of contracted revenue, according to Moody's — rent that it can begin collecting when it builds and delivers its AI facilities to those customers.\n\nSteven McDonald, a director at S&P Global Ratings, said that if CoreWeave is successful in scaling fast and realizing that contracted revenue, its credit rating could rise, lowering the cost of its borrowing and increasing profitability. S&P has assigned CoreWeave a below-investment-grade rating of B+ with a \"stable\" outlook.\n\n\"They've kind of outperformed at a high level against a lot of the things that we were initially looking at, whether it be the customer concentration, access to power,\" McDonald said. It \"is carving out a role as a player in the AI data center space. The relationship with Nvidia seems like it's going well, if not strengthening, and those are things that will factor favorably in our credit analysis.\"",

    "title": "China's New Aircraft Carrier Looks Powerful – But It Has A Major Problem",
    "description": "China's naval capabilities have been expanding in recent years, but its newest aircraft carrier lags behind U.S. counterparts in some important ways.",
    "fullText": "On paper, China's latest aircraft carrier looks awesome. The Fujian was commissioned on the 5th of November, 2025, and is the third and most powerful addition to China's carrier fleet. Its introduction saw it crowned as the world's largest non-nuclear powered warship. Which should be a distinct feather in the cap for the builders of China's first domestically designed aircraft carrier.\n\nAnd while its conventional power is a disadvantage when compared to American carriers like the Gerald R. Ford, the rest of the ship looks like a pretty serious upgrade for China's naval capabilities. For instance, other than the aforementioned Gerald R. Ford, the Fujian is the only carrier in the world boasting electromagnetic catapults.\n\nIn theory, this system allows the carrier to launch heavier aircraft with greater fuel and weapons loads — attributes that should greatly improve the carrier's potential reach and operational flexibility. But scratch just below the surface, and it appears that Beijing's latest carrier has at least one serious flaw.\n\nThe nature of the problem was raised after military analysts questioned the efficiency of the ship's flight deck layout. Technical assessments of this design trait seem to point to a layout that can potentially create launch and recovery bottlenecks during combat operations.\n\nThis is critical, as the flaw introduces constraints in the very area that ultimately defines a carrier's combat value — just how quickly it can launch and recover aircraft.\n\nModern aircraft carriers are far removed from the early carriers that appeared almost as soon as aviation was a thing. However, regardless of the generation of carrier, one attribute has been critical throughout the type's history — how quickly it can launch and recover aircraft. This tempo is referred to as sortie generation, and it depends heavily on flight deck geometry, hardware, and a carefully choreographed flight deck sequence.\n\nWe already know a lot about China's newest aircraft carrier, but there are cracks appearing in its powerful facade. In interviews with CNN, former US Navy captain Carl Schuster and retired Lt. Cmdr. Keith Stewart pointed out aspects of the Fujian's deck configuration that could limit the sortie generation metric.\n\nAfter reviewing images of the carrier, they noted that the angled landing area crosses the deck at a narrower angle than on US carriers, reducing space between the recovery strip and the forward catapults. One of those catapults also appears to intrude into the landing area, which means it can't be used while the carrier is recovering aircraft.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Schuster said, \"The Fujian's operational capability is only about 60% of that of the Nimitz class.\" Essentially, it appears that the carrier can't launch and recover aircraft simultaneously, something that is considered a prerequisite for carriers of this size.\n\nThe ship's flaws were also noted in a documentary shown on Chinese TV. The broadcast featured a crew member explaining how landing aircraft cross two of the launching catapults before stopping in a maintenance area.\n\nThis problem doesn't make the Fujian ineffective; the carrier still represents a significant leap forward for China's navy. The inclusion of an electromagnetic catapult system alone expands the types of aircraft it can launch and the payloads they can carry. As noted, the Gerald R. Ford is the only other operational ship boasting such a system. Although the John F. Kennedy has just completed a major milestone on its way to commissioning and will soon join this exclusive club.\n\nHowever, the propulsion systems remain a defining difference, and this has played a part beyond merely how the ships are powered and how long aircraft carriers can stay at sea without refueling. The Fujian's conventional power system is believed to have contributed to the design constraints with the elevators, island, and support areas beneath the flight deck. For comparison, nuclear propulsion frees more internal volume and allows designers more leeway when considering deck layouts and aircraft manipulation.\n\nThis is why analysts now widely expect China's next carrier, often referred to as the Type 004, to be the first Chinese nuclear-powered sub, and to incorporate the lessons learned from the Fujian's layout.\n\nFor now, despite its undoubted powerful look, the Fujian appears less like the finished object and more like a transitional design. A design that bridges China's move away from ski-jump carriers to a future where it potentially joins the US and France as the only countries to operate nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow it to move ahead with ending legal protections for migrants from Syria, in the latest emergency appeal to the nation's highest court.\n\nThe Department of Justice wants the court to lift a New York judge's ruling halting the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end temporary protected status for Syrians while lawsuits play out.\n\nThe government is also asking for a broader ruling that could affect other cases over protections for people from other countries as the administration pursues its immigration crackdown.\n\nThe conservative-majority court has previously allowed immigration authorities to end legal protections for migrants from Venezuela as litigation continues.\n\nAbout 6,100 people from Syria have temporary legal status after fleeing armed conflict, according to court documents. Ending those protections could halt their authorization to work legally in the United States and expose more to possible deportation, especially the 800 people with pending applications, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nProtections for Syrians were first granted protected status in 2012, during a civil war that lasted for more than a decade before the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government in late 2024.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted to revoke protected status less than a year later, finding that the situation \"no longer meets the criteria for an ongoing armed conflict that poses a serious threat to the personal safety of returning Syrian nationals.\"\n\nImmigration lawyers challenged that decision, arguing that Syria was still wrestling with a humanitarian crisis and the swift revocation of legal protections would force Syrians in the United States to confront “impossible choices.”\n\nJudge Katherine Polk Failla, who was nominated by democratic President Barack Obama, agreed to delay the termination in November. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left her decision in place.\n\nThe administration argues that the department can grant or revoke the temporary protections and judges should not interfere. A response to the administration's appeal is due March 4.\n\nDHS has taken steps to withdraw legal protections that have allowed immigrants from multiple countries to remain in the United States and work legally. That includes a combined total of more than a million people from Venezuela and Haiti. A different judge in Washington recently blocked the administration from ending protections for 350,000 Haitians.\n\nThe administration has scored a series of wins on the Supreme Court's emergency docket allowing it to move ahead with key parts of Trump's agenda, though the justices handed him a significant defeat on tariffs last week.\n\nCongress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation is granted in 18-month increments by the homeland security secretary.",

    "description": "Alan Cole, an economist in Washington, DC, wagered roughly $342,200 on whether federal spending would fall. He won $470,300, a roughly 37% return.",
    "fullText": "He said he bet his life savings on Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency failing to shrink federal spending — and won.\n\nNow, he's answering some questions.\n\nAlan Cole, a 37-year-old senior economist at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation in Washington, DC, said in a Wall Street Journal profile that he made a $342,195.63 bet on the prediction market Kalshi on whether federal spending in each quarter of 2025 would be higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nUltimately, it was, and Cole says he ended up winning $470,300.\n\nThat's a return of more than $128,000, or about 37%. He told the Journal that he made multiple sub-bets to spread out the risk and that he would only lose money if federal spending fell by more than $50 billion.\n\nFederal spending ultimately grew by hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025, despite DOGE's goal of slashing federal spending.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Cole addressed several questions that readers may have had about the bet.\n\nI'll do a little FAQ for if you clicked over to my profile from the WSJ article, which got more popular than I expected.\n\nQ: Was this a terrible risk?\nA: I promise it was fine and I was never worried about it. Closer to 100% than 99%, ex ante. The article mentions I considered it…\n\nFor one, he said he was \"never worried\" about the risk associated with the bet, viewing it as akin to a bond.\n\nHe also noted that federal spending is currently \"dominated by senior programs\" that have automated increases built in, plus interest payments on the national debt. \"Growth in these things is simply larger than the discretionary spending cuts,\" Cole wrote.\n\nCole also addressed whether it was a bad idea to risk such a large amount of money for a smaller return.\n\n\"Most good assets look like this, actually,\" Cole wrote. \"If anything, assets with potential for super-high returns relative to principal, like out-of-the-money call options, are the dangerous ones.\"\n\nHe also said that while he was taking a financial risk, he wouldn't lose everything if he lost his wager, given his \"big future earnings potential\" and assets like his home and a retirement account.\n\nCole also said he didn't \"hate\" Musk, as some might think.\n\n\"He has a mixed legacy for sure,\" Cole wrote, \"but I wish him the best especially on his most productive enterprises like SpaceX and Tesla.\"",

    "description": "Google managers are telling some employees their AI use will be factored into performance reviews, including non-technical staff.",
    "fullText": "Google is ramping up pressure for more employees to use AI — and it's not just software engineers who are expected to embrace it.\n\nIn recent weeks, managers at Google have informed some workers in non-technical roles that they are also expected to use AI in their workflows, four employees familiar with the changes told Business Insider.\n\nIn some cases, non-technical staff have been explicitly told that their AI use would be considered in their performance reviews later this year, two of the employees said.\n\nThe changes mark the next phase of Google trying to infuse AI into every corner of the company. Last year, Google told some software engineers that using AI was being formally made part of their job expectations, Business Insider previously reported. Google leaders have said that AI is increasingly responsible for code generated at the company.\n\nLike its peers, Google has been encouraging employees to use AI in the hopes it will make them more productive. Meta employees were told that their 2026 performance reviews would assess their \"AI-driven impact,\" Business Insider previously reported. Microsoft leaders have also told staff that AI is no longer optional.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai told employees last year that the company's rivals would be harnessing AI internally, and so Google must do the same.\n\nExpectations for using AI at Google vary across teams and roles. Engineers are expected to use AI coding assistants that can generate code and answer technical questions. Non-technical employees are being pushed to use AI to create strategy documents, analyze sales calls, and build customer insights, two members of staff told Business Insider.\n\nIn some cases, these expectations are being formally enshrined in employees' role profiles — an internal description of their job's tasks and expectations. Two employees in non-technical roles told Business Insider they were explicitly told by managers that their use of AI would be considered during performance reviews, known as Googler Reviews and Development (GRAD).\n\nTwo employees in sales roles told Business Insider they are expected to use internal AI tools that record phone calls and take notes. Some of them have been given quotas of how many times a week they are expected to use the tools, they said. In some cases, expectations will also be tied to seniority. A third employee said they were told that more senior staff were expected to demonstrate a better understanding of AI use than their more junior counterparts.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Business Insider that managers across technical and non-technical roles have the discretion to evaluate employees based on their use of AI. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that some software engineer roles would be graded on their use of AI.\n\nGoogle has been gradually turning up the dials on AI use internally. In June, engineering vice president Megan Kacholia sent an email to software engineers encouraging them to use AI tools and informing them that their job descriptions were updated to include using AI to solve coding problems.\n\nGoogle CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the company's Q4 2025 earnings call that around 50% of code at Google is written by agents, which is then reviewed by human engineers. That number appears to be increasing: Pichai put the figure at over 30% in April.\n\nGooglers are generally permitted to use only their company's internal AI tools. Employees can ask questions to a special version of Google's Gemini chatbot, named Duckie, that is familiar with internal documentation. There is also a coding tool named Goose, which is trained on Google's technical history, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nInternal AI tools are also designed so employees can input sensitive company information without risking it being leaked to the public. In some cases, these are third-party tools that have been modified for Google's internal needs. One tool used by Cloud sales employees is Yoodli, an AI avatar that sales reps can role-play conversations with before picking up the phone to call a customer.\n\nHave something to share?

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan have been together since college in the early 2000s. A lot has changed since then, including their style.",
    "fullText": "For example, they kept their outfits simple on the red carpet for the 2014 Breakthrough Prize ceremony.\n\nZuckerberg wore a black tuxedo and satin tie, while Chan sported a sparkling, sleeveless dress in a deep shade of blue.\n\nFor a state dinner that year, Zuckerberg sported his usual black suit, tie, and dress shoes.\n\nChan, on the other hand, looked elegant in a vibrant red dress with a lace overlay. She paired the garment with a black clutch, simple sandals, and an updo hairstyle.\n\nZuckerberg continued attending events like the 2016 Axel Springer Awards in dark suits and white undershirts. Rather than accessorizing, he added only belts and dress shoes.\n\nChan, on the other hand, began sporting all-black ensembles that year. For the awards ceremony, she donned black leggings underneath a knit tunic and ankle-length boots.\n\nFor the annual Breakthrough Prize ceremony, Zuckerberg wore a black tuxedo with sharp, satin lapels and his signature tie.\n\nChan dazzled alongside him, wearing a black sleeveless dress beneath a glitter-covered fishnet overlay with a high neckline and long sleeves.\n\nThey both walked the Breakthrough Prize red carpet in black suit jackets, with Chan wearing hers over a solid black gown.\n\nZuckerberg swapped his usual necktie for a bow tie.\n\nThe couple attended the 2024 UFC 300 event in April while wearing casual yet cool outfits. Zuckerberg wore a white T-shirt with black jeans, and Chan donned a black blazer as a dress with sunglasses and a gold necklace for accessories.\n\nThen, in May, Zuckerberg celebrated his birthday while wearing a graphic tee and a gold chain.\n\nZuckerberg's fashion changes might have been strategic. Meta announced in 2024 that it was working to win over Gen Z.\n\nThe Facebook founder could have been doing the same by upping his style reputation.\n\nZuckerberg, who matched fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos at the event, wore a navy suit, white button-down shirt, and deep red tie.\n\nChan, however, made a high-fashion statement with a baby-blue Bottega Veneta set. She wore a $2,500 wool cardigan, a matching $2,800 skirt, and chunky pearl necklaces.\n\nZuckerberg opted for an all-black outfit instead of a standard tuxedo. He wore a pleated button-down shirt, a matching jacket, dark trousers, shining dress shoes, and a pair of Meta AI Ray-Ban glasses, which cost between $299 and $549.\n\nChan took a bolder approach, incorporating various pieces from designer brands.\n\nShe tucked a white T-shirt into Alaïa's $11,400 black bubble skirt, draped an oversized blazer over both, and accessorized with a $2,000 Magda Butrym bag.\n\nShe also wore $1,200 lambskin and leather mules from Alaïa and a black-and-white snake necklace made from diamonds.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg wore a black tuxedo with matching dress shoes and a tie, Chan walked the event's purple carpet in a black-and-white gown.\n\nThe strapless piece had a statement bow at the waist, a pleat down its bodice, and a short cape attached to its back. She wore it with black heels and a serpent-shaped necklace covered in diamonds.\n\nTogether, the couple sat in the audience of Prada's runway show, wearing a mix of fashion staples from the Italian designer.\n\nZuckerberg's outfit included brown trousers and a tan, long-sleeved, collared shirt, while Chan's ensemble featured a thick black skirt, a gray sweater, and red socks.\n\nBoth wore chunky Prada loafers and small jewelry pieces for the fashion show.",

    "description": "The SBA's new inspector general urged Congress to give prosecutors more time to bring fraud charges related to two pandemic-era grant programs.",
    "fullText": "A top federal pandemic-aid investigator said the number of investigations into $43 billion in emergency grants to restaurants and entertainment businesses has been \"embarrassing\" and \"underwhelming.\"\n\nWilliam Kirk, the new inspector general for the Small Business Administration, urged Congress to give prosecutors more time to bring charges against people for defrauding two lesser-known pandemic aid programs: the $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund and the $14.6 billion Shuttered Venue Operators Grant.\n\n\"There is no possible way that our office would be able to investigate all of the outstanding referrals and cases that we've received in the SVOG and the RRF program,\" he said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. \"The scope of the work is such that we would need much more time.\"\n\nBusiness Insider reported in 2023 and 2024 on hundreds of millions of dollars that flowed from SVOG to artists like Lil Wayne, Post Malone, Marshmello, and Nickelback. While those grants may have been legal under the extremely broad language passed by Congress, records showed that some artists spent their taxpayer grants on lavish parties, private jets, and multimillion-dollar bonuses for themselves.\n\nSenator Joni Ernst has pushed to extend the window for bringing charges related to SVOG and RRF fraud. Ernst previously said her Democratic counterpart, Senator Ed Markey, wasn't letting the bill advance, though Markey's comments at the hearing suggested the logjam might be breaking.\n\n\"I am committed to passing this legislation as part of a comprehensive set of reforms and look forward to working with the chair to advance it, along with other bipartisan priorities,\" Markey said. \"That said, our efforts to fight against fraud should not be limited to going after small restaurants and theaters, especially when President Trump is letting off fraudsters left and right.\"\n\nThe bill had been caught up in a larger dispute about other small-business programs that provide research funds to early-stage tech companies. Markey said in a statement that a deal had been reached to extend them for five years.\n\nKirk, who was sworn in early January, said in prepared testimony that while hundreds of complaints have poured in about potential abuse of the Shuttered Venues program, his office has six open investigations. He said that while his office's investigators and auditors are \"dedicated professionals,\" they were focused on other areas of fraud in recent years.\n\nIn response to questions from Ernst, who leads the Senate small business committee, about whether Kirk's office would have time to bring charges before time runs out in April or May, Kirk called the office's work on those programs \"underwhelming.\"\n\n\"The handful of investigations — quite honestly, it's an embarrassing number — of investigations we currently have underway, those would probably time out,\" he added.\n\nCongress has already extended the statute of limitations to charge some fraud related to the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans, two larger and better-known programs, tacking on another five years to the normal five-year window to bring charges.\n\nSome Democrats at the hearing pressed Kirk to investigate the activities of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency at the SBA.\n\nAsked by Senator Jeanne Shaheen if he was concerned about the office's activities, Kirk said, \"Not currently, no.\"",

    "title": "These $80 packable sneakers from Reef are my holy grail travel shoes",
    "description": "I'm a travel writer, so I rely on packable shoes that can go the extra mile. The Reef Neptune sneakers check all my boxes for comfort, fit, and style.",
    "fullText": "I've never been much of a sneaker gal. As someone who lives in a year-round warm-weather climate, I'm more comfortable wearing sandals. That was until I started having foot tingling and pain.\n\nEager for a solution, I looked for shoes that would provide support, but look cuter than the chunky running sneakers I wear to work out. And, as a travel writer who takes several trips a year, I needed something close-toed that would be easy to pack, comfortable while sprinting through airports, and can hold up to 20,000-step days.\n\nThe Reef Neptune sneaker ticked all my boxes. Lightweight, ultra breathable, stylish, and with incredible arch support, they've now become my everyday walking shoe. \n\nThe best part is that they pack down flat, taking up just as much room in my luggage as a pair of sandals. But they're so dreamy to wear, you're more likely to find them on my feet than stuffed into my suitcase.\n\nA lightweight sneaker made with a breathable mesh knit, this shoe has a plush memory foam sole that’s comfortable from the first wear (and hundreds of miles later).\n\nThe sneakers' crushable, fold-down heel design makes slipping them on and off a cinch. This especially comes in handy when I'm running out the door to pick up my kids or in a busy airport security line and kicking myself for forgetting to add my TSA precheck number.\n\nThe Reef Neptunes are wildly comfortable from the very first wear. The ultra-soft memory foam insole and cushioned footbed remind me more of a plush slipper than a sneaker. They took no time to break in, and I can still feel the enhanced arch support hugging the soles of my feet, even after months of regular wear.\n\nThey're an approachable style with a true-to-size fit and middle-of-the-road width. I wear a size 8 sneaker and they fit perfectly, with no tightness in the toe box. The breathable, stretchy mesh sides will surely benefit wider feet, though sizing up a half size is always an option. If your feet run narrow, Reef suggests sizing down a half size for a snugger fit.\n\nAt $80, I think they're very reasonably priced. Especially compared to similar name-brand offerings — Allbirds' Tree Runner, for example, costs $20 more. Vivaia's All Day slip-on mesh sneaker commands $159.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've owned Reef's Ginger Flip Flops since the early 2000s. I consistently find this brands' shoes to be reliably well made, durable, and long lasting.\n\nThe biggest drawback I've experienced is how easily they stain. I deliberately chose gray instead of the white for this reason, but they still became dirty pretty quickly.\n\nTo clean them, I first remove the insoles, then combine warm water with a bit of dish soap and gentle detergent so I can brush away stains with a toothbrush. I soak the laces in the same solution, and use a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to remove scuff marks. Then, I stuff them with paper towels and let them air dry for 24 hours. Voila, good as new.\n\nSimply put, I've never worn a more comfortable sneaker. The fact that these shoes look good with everything, pack down ultra light, and remain comfy through miles of walking, has made them a true VIP in my closet (and suitcase).\n\nThat said, I did find it frustrating how easily they dirtied. In hindsight, I would've picked a darker color, and moving forward, I plan to clean them more regularly rather than wait for them to turn dark and dingy.\n\nStill, the Reef Neptune is a stylish, affordable option that travels well and might be as close as I'll ever come to walking on air. I'm not sure I can do much better than that.\n\nLearn how the Reviews team tests clothing, shoes and accessories at Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Walmart is set to pay about $16 million to Spark drivers as part of a larger settlement over claims that it misled workers about pay and tips.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday that Walmart agreed to a $100 million settlement over claims that the big-box retailer told Spark drivers they would earn \n\nPart of the proposed settlement includes a \"driver fund\" that would distribute $16.2 million to Spark drivers whose actual pay was lower than what Walmart promised through the delivery app, according to court documents. The payouts apply to offers Walmart made to drivers as far back as January 1, 2021.\n\n\"In many instances, Walmart either failed to notify drivers at all about the change in base pay and tips or only notified them of the change in their earnings after they completed the delivery,\" the FTC said in its announcement.\n\nA Walmart spokesperson said that the retailer values \"the hard work and dedication of the drivers who deliver great service and products to our customers.\"\n\n\"We have issued payments to impacted drivers and continue to make additional payments as appropriate,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are continuously improving procedures to ensure fairness and transparency for drivers.\"\n\nLast year, Walmart sent some Spark drivers surprise tip payments, some worth hundreds of dollars each. The company said it had identified some workers who had not received full tip payments in the past and had sent the payments, including interest.\n\nWalmart \"failed to notify drivers that, unlike the payment for the goods being delivered, the payment for the advertised tip amount had not been preauthorized, and therefore drivers would not receive that amount if the customer was unable to cover the cost of the tip or if the charge otherwise failed,\" the FTC said.\n\nWalmart also sometimes split a customer's tip across multiple drivers when filling an order that required multiple deliveries — a practice it also failed to tell drivers about, the FTC's complaint said.\n\nOther companies that rely on gig workers for deliveries have also faced charges that they failed to pay out tips.\n\nLast year, for example, DoorDash agreed to pay $16.75 million to 60,000 of its delivery workers in New York state to settle claims that the service used tips to offset workers' base pay.\n\nDo you work for Spark or another delivery service?

    "fullText": "In 10 years, there might not be many jobs, but there sure will be a lot of spin bikes. (At least, if you believe this ad.)\n\nThe Belgian AI startup AiCandy released a new advertisement for their company, mocking AI's skyrocketing demand for energy. It imagines a 2036 in which humans now power AI through group workouts — and features AI-aged versions of Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe video is a spoof ad for a company called \"Energym,\" which uses human cycling and rowing classes to generate the energy needed for AI.\n\n\"What if we could use the energy of humans to power the machines that took away their jobs,\" AI Musk said.\n\nA post shared by AiCandy (@aicandy.be)\n\nIt's a doomsday scenario, of course. (It's not clear that any AI job apocalypse is coming soon.) But it's one that resonated: The Instagram Reel has over 4 million views, while accounts continue to repost it on X, including one with nearly 2 million views.\n\n\"Doesn't feel like a parody of anything really,\" Sen. Chris Murphy wrote.\n\nAiCandy's Hans Buyse isn't such a fan of those reposts: \"They're making profit off of it,\" he said.\n\nBuyse and his cofounder, Jan De Loore, told Business Insider that they were thrilled with the reach of their videos. They expected some virality, but not the millions of views it would bring to their account.\n\nThe duo founded their AI video company in 2025. Buyse spent two decades working in commercials. De Loore is a motion designer and paints on the side. He has started using AI to model his paintings.\n\nInitially, clients gave them lots of pushback. Their feedback was mainly that \"it's polluting, it's consuming so much energy,\" De Loore said. Buyse then came up with the idea of making a video to showcase clean, human-made energy.\n\nThe idea was back-burnered until a couple of weeks ago, when De Loore thought to bring it back and frame it around aged US tech moguls.\n\n\"It's a combination also with the fitness hype, and young men that don't know what to do anymore with their lives,\" Buyse said. \"It's all coming together in one 40-second video.\"\n\nThe founders said they now have an inbox filled with collaboration requests. The Dor Brothers, a popular AI video production company, offered them a job, Buyse said.\n\nStill, they're holding out for one email in particular.\n\n\"We're just awaiting Elon,\" De Loore said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge said Thursday that the IRS broke the law by disclosing confidential taxpayer information “approximately 42,695 times\" to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly found that the IRS had erroneously shared the taxpayer information of thousands of people with the Department of Homeland Security as part of the agencies’ controversial agreement to share information on immigrants for the purpose of identifying and deporting people illegally in the U.S.\n\nHer finding was based off a declaration filed earlier this month by Dottie Romo, IRS’ chief risk and control officer, which revealed that the IRS had provided DHS with information on 47,000 of the 1.28 million people that ICE requested — and, in most of those cases, gave ICE additional address information in violation of privacy rules created to protect taxpayer data.\n\nKollar-Kotelly said in her Thursday decision that the agency violated IRS Code 6103, one of the strictest confidentiality laws in federal statute, “approximately 42,695 times by disclosing last known taxpayer addresses to ICE.” She called the Romo declaration “a significant development in this case.”\n\n“The IRS not only failed to ensure that ICE’s request for confidential taxpayer address information met the statutory requirements, but this failure led the IRS to disclose confidential taxpayer addresses to ICE in situations where ICE’s request for that information was patently deficient,\" she wrote.\n\nThe government is appealing the case, but the Thursday ruling is significant because Romo's declaration supports the decision on appeal.\n\nNina Olson, founder of the Center for Taxpayer Rights, which has sued the government over the disclosure, says “this confirms what we’ve been saying all along: that the IRS has an unlawful policy that violates the Internal Revenue Code’s protections by releasing these addresses in a way that violates the law’s requirements.”\n\nRepresentatives from the IRS and Treasury Department did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.\n\nA data-sharing agreement signed last April by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem allows ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records. The deal led the then-acting commissioner of the IRS to resign.\n\nThere are several ongoing cases that challenge the IRS-DHS agreement.\n\nEarlier this week, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declined to issue a preliminary injunction for the immigrants’ rights group, Centro de Trabajadores Unidos, and other nonprofits that are suing the federal government to stop implementation of the agreement.\n\nIn declining the preliminary injunction request, Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that the nonprofit groups “are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim,” since the information the agencies are sharing isn’t covered by the IRS privacy statute.\n\nStill, two separate court orders have blocked the agencies from massive transfers of taxpayer information and blocked ICE from acting upon any IRS data in its possession. Those preliminary injunctions are still in place.",

    "description": "At first, I worried that living at home as an adult meant a failure to launch. After my dad died and I began navigating grief, my perspective changed.",
    "fullText": "Growing up, when I imagined my 20s, I pictured living in a huge city apartment on my own, with a partner or a quirky group of roommates. I'd decorate my home with chic art pieces, paint the walls a dusty rose, and host dinner parties for my friends.\n\nI was desperate to begin my life. I thought adulthood started when you moved out; anything else felt like going backward.\n\nThen, my dad died, and my entire reality shifted.\n\nLiving with family as an adult is often framed as a \"failure to launch,\" but navigating grief at home with my mom and younger sister helped me rethink growth.\n\nAfter I finished college at 22, I moved in with my parents while I figured out what my long-term plan would be.\n\nI hoped this would be a very brief stint. Impatient to be more \"independent\" and worried I was falling behind my peers, I vowed to rent an apartment with my boyfriend as soon as we could afford one.\n\nBefore I had a chance to move out, though, the COVID-19 pandemic pushed us into a lockdown. I settled back into living with my family until further notice. There were practical benefits, such as saving money, but I still felt restless.\n\nIn ways, I reverted back to a teenager: whispering on FaceTime, sending messages on Snapchat, even sneaking out of my window to meet up with my partner after everyone had gone to sleep. At 22, I felt emotionally crowded and missed the freedom I'd experienced at college.\n\nMore than a loss of privacy, though, I was ashamed that I was still \"waiting\" to reach what I saw as the first big marker of adulthood.\n\nFour years after I moved back home, my dad suddenly passed away.\n\nWe couldn't properly say goodbye. Instead, we sat in fear for months. His chair was empty, leaving a hole in our home.\n\nAs guilty as I felt for not always appreciating the years I'd spent with him, I realized how lucky I was to have gotten to spend his last few years at home with him.\n\nMany fathers who get to grow old may never spend as much time with their children as I did with mine, precisely because I stayed home.\n\nMy dad had moved out of his house at a young age and lived in four countries. In one of our last one-on-one conversations, shortly before he was admitted into the hospital, he told me how everyone keeps moving to find their place, but everywhere is virtually the same. The main difference is the people that you're leaving behind.\n\nLooking back, those extra years at home were convenient, yes, but they were also the happiest I've ever been. Now, having my mom and sister by my side gives us space to grieve together and mutually support each other.\n\nAs a very tight-knit family, we built our life around traditions, from holidays and vacations to sports and movie nights.\n\nMy dad's favorite activity was spending time with us. He taught us skills like skiing, languages, and playing tennis.\n\nHealing came from returning to the traditions he loved. Although it was challenging at first, we forced ourselves to engage with his hobbies and rituals, reliving our memories together. We cooked his favorite food, sang songs he loved, and played lots of tennis.\n\nWith time, the sadness became more tolerable as we created new rituals while preserving treasured old ones.\n\nThis wasn't the \"20-something\" life I had envisioned, but this version of home became a symbol of my growth precisely because of how much I loved my past. I realized that living at home at 27 isn't a lack of maturity or a so-called \"failure to launch.\"\n\nIf anything, grief sharpened my sense of responsibility. Adulthood can be communal, and I feel lucky to have familial support. Grief has made living with my family more meaningful, grounding, and empowering than ever.",

    "fullText": "\"Happy Birthday!\" texts, emails, or social media posts don't quite have the same pizzazz as opening up a physical card in the mail.\n\nCousins Andrew Gold and Aaron Albert want to revive the art of mailing greeting cards for Gen Z and millennials with their startup Escargot.\n\n\"People want to feel human,\" Albert told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nLaunched in February, Escargot lets people send physical greeting cards for any occasion — birthdays, holidays, congratulations — all within its mobile app or website. Individual cards cost about $8, while subscriptions start at about $10 a month for two card credits that roll over.\n\nThe startup recently raised $2.75 million in seed funding from investors like Wischoff Ventures, Hannah Grey, and South Park Commons.\n\n\"This greeting card industry is massive,\" Gold said. Grand View Research estimated that the US card market was about $7.1 billion in 2025.\n\nGold said that most of the birthdays in the app are after 2000.\n\n\"That's where we have a big, fertile opportunity,\" Gold said. \"But we also are interested in marketing towards millennials and up as well.\"\n\nWhile AI has taken over the internet and social media has evolved to feel less social, there's also been a resurgence of analog media: landlines, photo booths, record players.\n\nThis \"cultural shift,\" Albert said, signaled to Escargot's founders that now was a good moment to launch a product centered on nostalgia for paper goods as a foil to the futuristic tech coming out of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"We're not Luddites,\" Albert said. \"We're not going to poo-poo tech.\"\n\nInstead, Escargot's founders plan to leverage tech and AI to return to a more social version of the web.\n\n\"We are not going out pitching ourselves as an AI company,\" Gold said. \"We are going to use it in interesting ways to power some of the experiences.\"\n\nGold, Escargot's CEO, previously worked at Apple and Coinbase, while Albert, Escargot's CMO, is a former child actor and the founder of mental health startup Felt.\n\nEscargot uses AI in a couple of ways.\n\nIf the available art doesn't suit the message you're trying to convey, Escargot offers the option to \"remix\" the card art with AI using Google's Gemini. Users can upload their own photos to the card, as well.\n\nThe app also uses AI to recommend moments to send cards to your friends if you give it access to your calendar and contacts.\n\nEscargot isn't the only one betting on the space. Hallmark, one of the leading greeting card incumbents, has an app that lets you send paper cards and reminders.\n\nIn its pitch to investors, Escargot emphasized that the company plans to expand beyond greeting cards with features that offer a twist on gift cards and more ways to keep people connected.\n\nEscargot is one of several AI-era startups that pitch users with tools to build stronger relationships in the real world. Retro, a photo-sharing social media platform, has a postcard feature that makes sending photos to friends and family as easy as posting online. There's also Rodeo, founded by former Hinge executives, which is using AI to streamline the process of getting together IRL with friends.\n\nEscargot has five full-time employees, including Gold and Albert, and plans to deploy its recent funding by building out its product ecosystem.\n\nRead the Notion memo Escargot used to pitch investors, shared exclusively with Business Insider.\n\nNote: Some details have been redacted.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Diving World Cup scheduled in Mexico next week was canceled due to safety concerns on Thursday.\n\nThe meet was to take place from March 5-8 in Zapopan, near Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco, where there has been a surge in violence since Sunday following the capture and death of the leader of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), Nemesio Oseguera.\n\n“A thorough risk assessment of the situation included consideration of travel restrictions and advice given by a number of international governments regarding travel to Mexico at the current time,” World Aquatics said in a statement. “The safety and participation of all athletes remain a fundamental priority for World Aquatics.”\n\nMexican sports officials were yet to comment on the cancellation.\n\nCartel members have burned cars and blocked roads in nearly a dozen Mexican states and authorities report that at least 70 people have died. The CJNG is considered the most powerful and violent cartel in Mexico and it is centered in Jalisco state.\n\nEven though Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has said things are getting back to normal, in Guadalajara there was still fear among its citizens.\n\nFour high-level soccer matches were postponed last Sunday, including one in the central city of Queretaro, where Mexico defeated Iceland 4-0 on Wednesday in a friendly. Top-tier team Atlas held workouts through Zoom.\n\nOn Wednesday, four softballers from the Guadalajara-based Jalisco Charros of the Women's Professional League asked to be released from the team for “personal reasons.” They were American Nicola Simpson, Canadians Natalie Wildman and Janet Lung and Dutch player Eva Voortman.\n\nAP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports",

    "fullText": "Update: Shortly after this story was published, Netflix announced that it would not raise its bid for WBD.\n\nParamount Skydance may finally have the upper hand on Netflix in the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe WBD board announced on Thursday afternoon that it believes Paramount's improved offer to buy the entire company for $31 per share is better than Netflix's proposal to buy its streaming and studio assets for $27.75 per share. Both offers are all cash.\n\nParamount's bid also includes a so-called \"ticking fee,\" which will pay WBD shareholders $0.25 per share, or about $650 million, for every quarter that its deal doesn't get regulatory approval, starting September 30.\n\nNetflix now has four business days to raise its bid, if it chooses. It could also decide to walk away and collect a $2.8 billion breakup fee from WBD, which Paramount has said it will cover.\n\n\"While Netflix has the opportunity to increase its bid and reclaim WBD, the bigger question is if it's in Netflix's interest to continue pursuit,\" said Ross Benes, a senior analyst at EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. \"Netflix and Paramount stocks have taken a hit since this bidding war started. Investors will not be keen on increasing bids further.\"\n\nIf Netflix doesn't improve its offer, WBD's board will formally change its recommendation and kill its Netflix deal. WBD shareholders will vote on March 20 to approve the transaction with the highest bidder.\n\nParamount and Netflix have each been on a mission to convince Hollywood, consumers, and government officials that they'd be the better buyer of Warner Bros.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount is willing to pay WBD a $7 billion breakup fee if its deal is blocked by regulators, a sign of his confidence in winning over the US Department of Justice under President Donald Trump. (Netflix has agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if regulators blocked its deal.) Ellison would also need regulatory approval in Europe and could face challenges at the state level in the US.\n\nParamount has warned that Netflix would become an overpowering juggernaut if it bought HBO and the Warner Bros. studio. Netflix has argued that it competes with YouTube and traditional TV, not just paid streamers.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has been on a charm offensive, telling politicians, the creative community, and the public that Netflix would create jobs if it bought Warner Bros. Sarandos visited the White House this week, Politico reported.\n\nTrump said earlier this month he'd stay out of the process, though he said in December that Netflix's market share \"could be a problem.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider last week that Trump \"has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder.\"\n\nTrump, however, said shortly after that Netflix should remove Susan Rice from its board and would otherwise \"pay the consequences.\" Rice, who worked in the White House under Obama and Biden, was critical of Trump on a podcast and said companies that bow to him could face retribution. Sarandos downplayed Trump's comments, saying that the company's plan to buy Warner Bros. is \"not a political deal.\"\n\nParamount has promised investors $6 billion in savings if it wins the bidding war, compared to Netflix's target of $2 billion to $3 billion. WBD's board, as recently as last week, expressed concern that could lead to an employee exodus if Paramount won control of the company.",

    "description": "The Washington Post reported that activists are working with the White House on an executive order to declare a \"national emergency\" over America's elections.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump gestures after speaking to soldiers and their families at Fort Bragg, N.C., Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. \n\nThe Washington Post reported that activists are working with the White House on an executive order to declare a “national emergency” over America’s elections and pave the way for a power grab.\n\n“Pro-Trump activists who say they are in coordination with the White House are circulating a 17-page draft executive order that claims China interfered in the 2020 election as a basis to declare a national emergency that would unlock extraordinary presidential power over voting,” reported the Post‘s Isaac Arnsdorf. “President Donald Trump has repeatedly previewed a plan to mandate voter ID and ban mail ballots in November’s midterm elections, and the activists expect their draft will figure into Trump’s promised executive order on the issue.”\n\nPeter Ticktin, a MAGA activist in favor of the executive order, told the Post that “we have a situation where the president is aware that there are foreign interests that are interfering in our election processes,” and that “the president has to be able to deal with it,” including by banning mail-in ballots and certain voting machines.\n\n“If there was a provable foreign intrusion, that would be a national security emergency and the order could be issued under his powers as commander in chief,” added Jerome Corsi, another activist lobbying on behalf of the executive order.\n\nTrump has long alleged that the country’s elections are “rigged,” most notably after his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, when his false claims culminated in a violent riot at the Capitol Building.\n\nTrump told Dan Bongino, the conservative commentator and former deputy director of the FBI, that “The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting in at least 15 places'” earlier this month.\n\n“The Republicans oughta nationalize the voting,” he added.\n\nTrump previously promised to act unilaterally if Congress failed to pass a bill mandating voter I.D.\n\n“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS. They have all sorts of reasons why it shouldn’t be passed, and then boldly laugh in the backrooms after their ridiculous presentations. If it weren’t such a serious matter, it would be considered a TOTAL JOKE! No Voter I.D. is even crazier, and more ridiculous, than Men playing in Women’s Sports, Open Borders, or Transgender for Everyone. Republicans must put this at the top of every speech — It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND! Even Democrat Voters agree, 85%, that there should be Voter I.D. It’s only the Political ‘Leaders,’ Crooked Losers like Schumer and Jeffries, that have no shame, and explain why it’s “racist,” and every other thing that they can think of,” wrote the president in a February 13 Truth Social post. “This is an issue that must be fought, and must be fought, NOW! If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.”\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Mulling Plan to Declare ‘National Emergency’ Paving Way for Major Power Grab first appeared on Mediaite.",

The well-connected financier died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial.\n\nClinton on Thursday called the committee's probe \"partisan political theatre,\" saying she doesn't recall ever having met Epstein.\n\n\"I do not recall ever encountering Mr. Epstein. I never flew on his plane or visited his island, homes, or offices,\" she said.\n\nHere is my opening statement to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today. pic.twitter.com/NZSF2epcI5\n\nShe proceeded to rip into the committee's members, accusing them of not doing more to end human trafficking or seek justice for Epstein's victims.\n\n\"A committee endeavoring to stop human trafficking would seek to understand what specific steps are needed to fix a system that allowed Epstein to get away with his crimes in 2008,\" she said.\n\n\"It would ensure that the lawful reductions of those files protected the victims and survivors, not powerful men in political allies,\" she added.\n\n\"It would subpoena anyone who asked on which night there would be the 'wildest party' on Epstein Island,\" she said in a not-so-veiled reference to Musk.\n\nEmails released by the Department of Justice on January 30 showed Musk asking that very question while discussing plans to visit Epstein's Caribbean island in 2012.\n\n\"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\" Musk asked in the November 2012 email chain.\n\nThe question was in response to an email from Epstein offering to send a helicopter to whisk the Tesla and SpaceX CEO to his private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"how many people will you be for the heli to island,\" Epstein asked Musk in an email exchange. Musk said he'd need just two seats — for himself and his then-partner, Tallulah Riley.\n\nThe DOJ's files have not revealed any communications suggesting that Musk knew about Epstein's crimes. Musk has denied visiting the island. A representative for the Tesla CEO didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nClinton's husband, former President of the United States Bill Clinton, has been prominently featured in the DOJ's Epstein files, including numerous photos of the two men together.\n\nBill Clinton is expected to testify before the committee in Chappaqua, NY, where the Clintons live, on Friday. He has previously said he travelled on Epstein's plane four times, in 2002 and 2003, while on trips for the Clinton Foundation.\n\nHillary Clinton has previously acknowledged a relationship with Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for participating in Epstein's trafficking of young women.\n\nOn Thursday, she said she had no knowledge of Maxwell's crimes.\n\n\"The committee justified its subpoena to me, based on its assumptions that I have information regarding the investigations into the criminal activities of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" she said. \"Let me be as clear as I can.

    "description": "Netflix said it wouldn't pay more for Warner Bros., and the deal was \"no longer financially attractive,\" two days after Paramount increased its offer.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has won the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNetflix said Thursday it won't raise its bid, paving the way for Paramount to buy WBD and become a Hollywood behemoth.\n\nThe decision comes two days after Paramount increased its offer to $31 per share for all of WBD, including its cable networks like CNN and HGTV. WBD's board said Thursday that Paramount's latest offer was better than Netflix's proposal to buy its streaming and studio assets — including Warner Bros. and HBO Max — for $27.75 per share.\n\n\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.\"\n\nNetflix will now pocket a $2.8 billion breakup fee paid by WBD, which Paramount has said it will reimburse.\n\nNetflix investors seem thrilled. The stock surged by more than 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Paramount shares jumped about 5%.\n\nWBD shares slipped 1.8%, a potential sign that shareholders were counting on an even bigger bidding war.\n\nA combination of Paramount and WBD could create a true rival to Hollywood leaders Netflix and Disney. However, despite its size, it would still face the daunting task of transitioning legacy media assets — including declining cable TV networks — to a new era dominated by streaming and social media.\n\n\"We are excited about the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can't wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world,\" WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a statement.\n\nEllison has relentlessly pursued WBD for months, making 10 official offers for the company. His pursuit of WBD has been backed by his father, Larry Ellison, the billionaire cofounder of cloud giant Oracle.\n\nParamount already owns its iconic movie studio, Paramount+, CBS, and TV networks like MTV and Comedy Central.\n\nIf Paramount's WBD deal secures regulatory approvals, it will get the Warner Bros. studio, HBO, HBO Max, and cable networks like CNN, TNT, and HGTV, plus the Discovery+ streaming service.\n\nThough the combination would make Ellison a Hollywood heavyweight, his company would still fall behind Netflix in a few key metrics.\n\nHBO Max had 131.6 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter, while Paramount+ had 78.9 million paid subscribers as of late 2025.\n\nNetflix crossed 325 million subscribers in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nWBD's streaming services accounted for 1.4% TV share on US TVs in January, according to Nielsen, compared to 2.3% for Paramount's streamers. For comparison, Netflix was at 8.8% while Disney's streamers got 4.9%.\n\nOne side plot is that CNN may soon find itself with the same corporate parent as CBS News, which Ellison has begun to remake by installing the polarizing Bari Weiss as its editor in chief.\n\nParamount has framed itself as a better buyer for WBD than Netflix, which it said would wield unhealthy sway over competitors and consumers if it bought HBO and gained access to iconic IP like DC Comics' Batman.\n\nNetflix argued that it would be a better caretaker of Warner Bros. by laying off fewer staffers than Paramount would, while creating TV jobs in a Hollywood plagued by fewer productions. Paramount has promised investors $6 billion in cost savings from the deal.\n\nBoth Netflix and Paramount have angled for support from regulators and President Donald Trump. Paramount is willing to pay WBD a $7 billion breakup fee if its deal is blocked, a sign of Ellison's confidence in regulatory approval.\n\nA White House spokesperson told Business Insider in mid-February that Trump had \"great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference\" for Netflix or Paramount.\n\nHowever, Netflix caught Trump's ire days later, with the president saying that the streaming giant must remove board member Susan Rice \"or pay the consequences.\" Rice, a White House official during the Obama and Biden administrations, appeared on a podcast and criticized Trump and companies she believes chose to \"take a knee\" to the president.\n\nSarandos previously downplayed Trump's comments, saying the Netflix-Warner Bros. tie-up is \"not a political deal.\"",

    "fullText": "A man who lived in the iconic New Yorker Hotel for half a decade without paying a single cent in rent has been sentenced to jail.\n\nPolice arrested Mickey Barreto in February 2024 and charged him with filing fraudulent property records after he attempted to claim ownership of the hotel, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.\n\nProsecutors said Barreto skirted thousands of dollars worth of rent payments by exploiting a little-known local housing law, and then attempted to charge another tenant in the building rent.\n\n“As alleged, Mickey Barreto repeatedly and fraudulently claimed ownership of one of the City’s most iconic landmarks, the New Yorker Hotel,” Alvin Bragg, Manhattan's district attorney, said in a statement in 2024.\n\nBarreto faced 24 charges, including 14 felony fraud counts, The New York Times reported. In February 2026, he pled guilty to a felony count of filing a false instrument and was sentenced to six months in jail and five years of post-release probation.\n\nBarreto's residency at the renowned hotel — which in its heyday hosted many dignitaries and celebrities, including Muhammad Ali and John F. Kennedy — dates back to 2018 when he first learned about New York City's Rent Stabilization Code. This law grants tenants living in individual rooms in buildings built before 1969 the right to request a six-month lease.\n\nIn June 2018, Barreto checked into room 2565 with his partner, Matthew Hannan, for one night and was charged $200.57.\n\nThe following day, Barreto requested a six-month lease from the hotel and was promptly evicted.\n\nBarreto — a California transplant with a penchant for conspiracy theories who also claims to be the leader of a tribal community he founded in Brazil, according to The New York Times — refused to take no for an answer.\n\nThat July, he took the building's owner, the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, to housing court, claiming he was illegally evicted. A representative for the church didn't show up, so the judge sided with Barreto, and the hotel had to give him the key.\n\nThe two parties never agreed on lease terms, and because he couldn't be evicted, Barreto lived at the hotel rent-free.\n\nSoon, Barreto began portraying himself as the hotel's owner and eventually demanded rent from one of the building's tenants, the TickTock diner.\n\nThe DA's office said that Barreto also registered the hotel under his name with the city's Department of Environmental Protection as part of an effort to gain control of the hotel’s bank accounts.\n\nThe Unification Church, which bought the New Yorker in 1976, sued Barreto for representing himself as the hotel's owner on LinkedIn and uploading a forged deed to a city website. Barreto was ordered by a judge to stop asserting that he owned the building, but he continued to live there.\n\nIn 2023, Barreto again filed papers with the city claiming to be the building's owner, and that's when the district attorney's office stepped in.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to Barreto through his company, Mickey Barreto Missions, in 2024, but didn't receive a response before publication.\n\n“I never intended to commit any fraud. I don’t believe I ever committed any fraud,” Barreto told The Associated Press. “And I never made a penny out of this.”\n\nWhen asked for a comment by Business Insider, the New York City Police Department directed questions to the district attorney's office.\n\nCorrection: April 12, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated details about the legal claims filed by Barreto and the building's owner. Barreto initially took the building owner to housing court for being illegally evicted, and a judge sided with him because a representative for the owner did not appear in court. That case did not go before the state Supreme Court and there was no appeal filed. The story has also been updated to clarify some details about the chronology of the legal disputes between the two parties.",

    "description": "Going viral brought new customers, but didn't guarantee customer retention. The Chocbox founder shares how's she's building a lasting business.",
    "fullText": "For years, Brittany Nemandoust struggled to keep her small business afloat.\n\nChocbox, her DIY chocolate-making kit company, started as a pandemic project after shutdowns left her temporarily out of work as a dental hygienist. When she returned to the dental office, the business remained a side hustle.\n\nSales fluctuated, spiking over the holidays and slowing down during the spring and summer.\n\nAround April 2024, she and her husband, Kevin, sat down to discuss whether it was time to shut it down. Sales weren't enough to cover expenses, including rent for a small office in Los Angeles and payroll for a part-time employee, and Nemandoust had taken on credit-card debt to keep the company running.\n\nOn paper, closing made sense. But she wasn't ready to give it up.\n\n\"I was really optimistic. I'm like, 'I know that it's going to happen at some point. It's going to blow up,'\" she told Business Insider. \"I just had a feeling.\"\n\nA few weeks later, an opportunity emerged. Nemandoust had noticed videos of a thick, pistachio-filled \"Dubai chocolate\" bar flooding TikTok. Influencers were trying to recreate it at home, and comment sections were filled with the same questions: Where do you get these ingredients? How do you make this?\n\nUnlike most viewers, she already ran a chocolate kit business. Plus, years earlier, she had custom-designed a chocolate mold that was 20-30% thicker than standard molds — originally, she said, because she felt customers deserved a more substantial bar. That thickness turned out to be exactly what the viral Dubai bar required.\n\nThe couple went to a Middle Eastern grocery store in their neighborhood, bought pistachio cream and kataifi pastry, and tested their own version. Then, they filmed a video of the two of them breaking the bar in half and tasting it.\n\n\"It wasn't a pretty video. It was just very raw,\" she said, but the response was immediate.\n\nWithin 20 minutes, the video had 500 views, more than her videos typically received. Minutes later, the count doubled. By the end of the day, more than 100,000 people had viewed the video, and orders were pouring in. She hit TikTok's daily cap for new sellers, 100 orders, that day and again the next.\n\nThere was just one problem: She didn't have hundreds of kits ready to ship.\n\nGoing viral was exhilarating, but chaotic.\n\nTwo ingredients in particular — kataifi and pistachio cream — were difficult to source. Online suppliers were sold out, so she and Kevin started calling Turkish markets across Los Angeles. They even phoned gelato shops, knowing pistachio cream is often used in pistachio ice cream.\n\nThey also needed extra hands to pack orders, so they called friends, family, and anyone willing to pack boxes at odd hours.\n\n\"When you go viral, you need it now,\" Nemandoust said. \"You don't have time to go through a hiring process or wait a week for a bulk order of items. You need it ASAP.\"\n\nIn addition to pulling from every resource they had, they worked 15-hour days, waking up around 6 a.m. and finishing late at night. They often livestreamed their long days, which helped build their community that would be integral to sustained success.\n\n\"We would be up and just livestream at like 11 pm at night, blasting music, and I honestly think that's how we started building our community — showing people the rawness of what it means to go viral,\" she said.\n\nAs chaotic as that time was, the couple still focused on building systems to keep up with demand. They created instructions for assembling a kit, for how it should look when complete, and for packaging and labeling it correctly. They printed photos of finished kits and taped them to the walls, and recorded short videos demonstrating the packing process so new helpers and employees could avoid mistakes.\n\n\"The worst thing you can do when you go viral is not fulfill orders,\" Kevin, who quit his corporate job in 2025 to help grow Chocbox, said. \"People are dying for your product, and if you don't send it, that can almost instantly kill your momentum.\"\n\nThey also resisted the temptation to assume the viral spike would last forever. Instead, they focused on turning a moment into infrastructure: improving sourcing, tightening operations, and gradually expanding capacity. They moved from a 5-by-6-foot cubicle to larger office spaces in the same building, eventually upgrading to a 6,000-square-foot warehouse. Today, they employ eight people.\n\nGoing viral brought new customers, but didn't guarantee customer retention. To create a lasting business, they've focused on building a community and creating the best possible product.\n\nFrom the start, Nemandoust leaned into community-building. She livestreamed on TikTok, assembling kits in real time, answering questions, and interacting directly with viewers.\n\n\"I want people to think of me when they think of Chocbox,\" she said. \"I want to be part of the brand.\"\n\nThe livestreams weren't just sales channels. They became a means of building trust. Customers watched orders being packed, saw the behind-the-scenes scramble, and felt included in the growth.\n\nAffiliates became another key pillar. TikTok's native affiliate system allowed creators to tag Chocbox products in their videos and earn commissions. At first, influencers were simply buying the kits themselves and posting about them. Over time, the couple built a more intentional network of roughly 30 highly engaged affiliates, whom they call \"Chocboxers.\"\n\n\"We invest in them, and they invest in us,\" Kevin said, noting that some of their affiliates earn thousands of dollars a month in commission. \"They're an extension of our brand.\"\n\nBeyond community, they've maintained discipline in their product strategy and kept a tight focus on a hero product: the chocolate-making kit. They later added refill kits and a jarred version of their pistachio filling, branded as \"Dubai Dip,\" but resisted flooding their website with dozens of flavors.\n\n\"When we release products, they have to be really good,\" Nemandoust said. \"It's never going to be mediocre.\"\n\nThey're constantly engaging with their customers, asking them what they want and using that feedback to create products that excite their community.\n\nToday, both Brittany and Kevin work on Chocbox full time. Sales still fluctuate seasonally — peaking during the holidays and around Valentine's Day, slowing in summer — and growth still comes with stress, but the conversation they had in April 2024 feels distant now.\n\nThey said the company recently surpassed 300,000 units sold on TikTok Shop. Just a couple of years ago, they were preparing to shut Chocbox down. From the outside, the milestone looks like an overnight success. It's anything but, said Kevin: \"If people really knew how hard it was behind the scenes, the amount of turbulence it took to get here is insane.\"\n\nThat turbulence, the couple says, is the part most aspiring founders don't see. At the end of the day, starting and maintaining a small business is \"really hard,\" he said. But if you want to do it, \"the only thing getting in the way of starting a business is truly yourself. Just start.\"",

    "fullText": "Block CEO Jack Dorsey issued a warning about the impact of AI on employment, particularly for other companies\n\nAfter announcing he's cutting about 40% of Block's 11,000 employees, Dorsey outlined Block's next phase as a \"smaller, faster, intelligence-native company\" in his opening remarks during the company's earnings call on Thursday.\n\n\"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late,\" he said.\n\nAI, he said, is dramatically accelerating work inside Block.\n\n\"A significantly smaller team using the tools we're building can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every single week,\" Dorsey said\n\nDorsey pointed to a sharp jump in AI capabilities late last year, surpassing Block's own internal tool, Goose, which it uses to speed up coding and other repetitive work.\n\n\"Something happened in December last year where the models just got an order of magnitude more capable and more intelligent,\" he said.\n\nDorsey predicted more companies will follow suit, using AI to drive efficiency gains. Block, he said, is moving ahead of a trend that \"all companies will eventually\" embrace.\n\nThe Bay Area tech company, which owns Square, Cash App, and Tidal, had \"a lot of duplication\" that needed to be streamlined, Dorsey said.\n\nBlock CFO Amrita Ahuja said that at Block, engineering work that would have taken weeks now takes a fraction of the time thanks to AI coding tools.\n\nOutput per engineer is up by more than 40% since September, she added.\n\nAlthough Block is shedding over 4,000 people from its 10,000-strong workforce, it's expanding in one area — senior engineering talent focused on AI, Ahuja said.",

The car, first hoisted into the air in May 1996 as part of a marketing display, had become a local landmark and had only been lowered once before, in 2009.\n\nThe dealership originally elevated the Viper as a promotional move, using the bright red sports car as a highly visible attraction instead of placing it on the sales lot. The vehicle, showing just 12 original miles on the odometer, remained mounted high above the property for decades. In November 2024, marking 15 years since its last refurbishment, the dealership arranged for the car to be taken down again for evaluation. Images shared by a local resident documented the removal process and indicated that restoration efforts would be more extensive than initially expected.\n\nUpon inspection, the Viper showed significant wear from prolonged exposure. The paint had deteriorated, and the interior was found to contain mold. An entire bird’s nest had developed inside the engine bay. Despite speculation over the years that the elevated car might have been a replica or shell, the dealership confirmed it was a complete, authentic Viper.\n\nThe vehicle was transported to Keen’s Auto Body and Paint for refinishing work, including a full repaint of its red exterior. The restoration aimed to return the car to its original appearance while preserving its status as a recognizable feature of the dealership.\n\nFollowing the refurbishment, the Dodge Viper has been restored to display condition, maintaining its role as a longstanding visual fixture associated with the dealership since 1996.\n\nVia Viper Club of America/Facebook",

The startup, based in San Francisco and focused on helping developers custom-build AI models, has faced a wave of poaching by bigger tech and AI companies, namely Meta and OpenAI.\n\nChristian Gibson and Noah Shpak are both listed as members of Thinking Machines Lab's founding team on an earlier version of its website. Both have been working at Meta for a few weeks, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nGibson is a former OpenAI engineer who specializes in supercomputers used for training AI models and who worked on the first ChatGPT model.\n\nShpak is an AI-focused engineer who previously worked at the startup Character.AI and at X (then known as Twitter).\n\nAnother Thinking Machines Lab cofounder, Andrew Tulloch, left for Meta last year. Last month, it lost its CTO, Barret Zoph, and Luke Metz, both cofounders, to OpenAI, along with two researchers. Thinking Machines Lab also lost Jolene Parish, a founding member who specializes in security, Business Insider reported.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has become known for attracting top AI talent.

    "description": "Finally, my trail runs can default to my trail shoes!",
    "fullText": "If you track your runs (and bike rides, and all your other exercise) with a Garmin device, you’ve probably already found its gear tracking features. This is how I realized I'd put over 1,000 miles on my favorite Nikes.\n\nUntil recently, the usefulness stopped there. But in a new (free) update, Garmin has introduced a ton of new gear tracking features, including one I’ve been hoping for ever since I bought my first pair of trail shoes.\n\nNow, gear tracking isn’t just for shoes. If you ride a bike, you can now count your bike as a piece of gear, or even individual components of your bike, like the frame or the tires. Other now trackable types of gear include skis, surfboards, boots, boats, skates, and wheelchairs. These new tracking features can be found in the Garmin Connect phone app that came out alongside a software update for several Garmin watches.\n\nGarmin Connect (the phone app that syncs with your Garmin watch or other device) has a revamped set of features for the Gear section, which you’ll find under the More menu in the bottom right corner of the app.\n\nA database of existing brands and models\n\nAutomatic gear tracking is more detailed\n\nYou can create “collections” of gear that are used together\n\nGear stats are now viewable from your watch\n\nThere’s a small thing I missed when I switched from Coros back to Garmin last year: In the Coros app, I was able to designate a default shoe for my regular runs, and a different default shoe for trail runs. Garmin used to only allow you to have one default running shoe.\n\nThe new update delivers similar functionality to my Garmin, alongside a lot more detail. You can now choose to automatically add a given gear item to any activity your watch can track. For example, I can still set a shoe to be added automatically to “all Running” and that will be the same behavior as before. But I can also set my beloved (muddy, ripped-up, long-suffering) trail shoes as the default for trail running, and my nice new Nike Downshifters (1,000 mile target) as the default for the regular “run” activity. If I had a shoe I kept in my gym bag for the treadmill, I could set a separate default for treadmill runs as well.\n\nGarmin now offers “collections” of gear that you use together. For a bike, you could combine your favorite tires, frame, and so on. Just as you can add individual items automatically to certain activity types, you can also assign a collection as the default for an activity. For example, a collection that includes your jogging stroller and your street running shoes could be automatically added to all your street running activities.\n\nSo far there's no overall gear viewer on the watch (I was hoping for a glance) but you can see your gear options under the activities. Select an activity—say, Run—and you'll see which shoe or gear is assigned to it by default. If you'd like to change the default, you can scroll down and select a different shoe, or decide not to log a shoe at all. When you look at each shoe, you can see a bar showing how many miles you've put on the gear compared to the lifespan you've entered.",

    "title": "Amazon's Alexa+ Has Three New Personalities to Choose From",
    "description": "You can choose between Brief, Chill, and Sweet.",
    "fullText": "At the beginning of February, Amazon officially launched Alexa+, the company's new AI-powered assistant. Alexa+ is like the old Alexa, but with new contextual abilities. Users can ask complex, multipart questions, as well as requests for tasks, like asking Alexa to book you concert tickets. If you've used a voice mode on chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, you're familiar with the concept—it's just now available on your Echo devices, too. Now, Amazon is letting you lightly customize the personality of your new AI assistant, offering the choice between concise, calm, and enthusiastic bots.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amazon announced \"Alexa+ personality styles,\" a new feature that lets you customize how Alexa responds to queries and requests. At launch, Amazon is rolling out three styles for this experience: \"Brief,\" \"Chill,\" and \"Sweet.\" According to Amazon, Brief is the choice for users who want shorter responses that are more direct and to the point. There should be less flowery language that chatbots are known for, including small talk and \"extra conversation.\" Chill, on the other hand, aims to be an \"easygoing and \"relaxed\" personality, that emulates \"chatting with a laid-back friend.\" Amazon says users who add the Chill personality to Alexa+ will notice conversations are \"breezy,\" and Alexa+ should offer \"gentle guidance\" with requests. Sweet is your \"biggest cheerleader\": Amazon says this bot responds with warmth and enthusiasm, celebrating your successes, encouraging you, and transforming \"everyday moments into opportunities for positivity.\" (I just wanted to know the weather, Alexa.)\n\nYou can hear a sample of each personality on Amazon's official announcement page, or use the embeds below. Amazon has uploaded Soundcloud links with a brief for each, so you can get a sense of the voice and style of all three. First, there's Brief, which just says, \"Operating efficiently\":\n\nNext, is Chill, which says, \"Life's treating me well. All systems are zen, and the digital universe is spinning in harmony\":\n\nFinally, there's Sweet, which says, \"Absolutely fantastic. I'm radiating pure joy, and ready to make your day incredibly amazing\":\n\nAmazon says each of these voices was created following five pillars: Expressiveness, which can be concise to verbose; Emotional Openness, which can be reserved to enthusiastic; Formality, which can be professional to casual; Directness, which can be diplomatic to blunt; and Humor, which can range from subtle wit to overt sarcasm. Each pillar has its own ranges, which informs each personality. For example, Amazon says that Brief is specifically concise, casual, and direct, with minimal humor, while Sweet is warm, emotionally expressive, casual, and encouraging.\n\nDespite the audio samples above, Amazon won't force you to stick with these default voices, either. You can choose a new personality style while, at the same time, swapping between the eight different voice options Amazon offers.\n\nAnyone with access to Alexa+—either through the Alexa+ subscription or a Prime subscription—can try these changes. Amazon says it made the process for trying new personality styles quite easy: You can just say \"Alexa, change your personality style.\" Alternatively, you can also find the options in the Alexa app. Select the device in question, then head to Device Settings > Alexa's Personality Style.\n\nTo change the voice of your chosen style, head to your device's settings again in the Alexa app, then, under \"General,\" choose your voice.",

    "title": "I Can't Wait to Try Spotify's Newest Playlist Sorting Feature",
    "description": "How to arrange your songs by BPM.",
    "fullText": "Spotify's adding a new way to sort playlists for paying subscribers. The feature is called Smart Reorder, and it allows you to automatically sort your songs by BPM (beats per minute) and key. This is great for those who want to gradually bump up the intensity of the songs they listen to.\n\nIt's worth noting that this feature only works for playlists you've created or those you've mixed using the Spotify Mix feature, which lets you add or customize song transitions like a DJ would. Also, because Smart Reorder is an extension of Spotify Mix, you can't have one without the other. Spotify Mix hasn't yet been launched in all markets where the streaming service is present, including where I live, and as such, Smart Reorder isn't available in those regions yet. It's a shame, because I'm really excited to try it.\n\nIf you're a Spotify Premium subscriber, using the Smart Reorder feature is easy. Just open any of the playlists you've created or mixed, and tap the Edit button above the first song. Scroll to the bottom and select Smart Reorder. Spotify will automatically rearrange your songs by BPM, and you can tap the Save button up top to confirm the changes.\n\nSmart Reorder should be a very useful feature for people like me, who prefer workout playlists that slowly bump up in intensity. I like to hear high BPM songs towards the end of my gym sessions or runs, but that might not be ideal for everyone. Some types of exercises, such as spin workouts, might be better off switching between high and low BPM songs as the intensity varies, and Smart Reorder wouldn't be great for those use cases. Some users on Reddit also suggested that you should create a copy of your playlists before using Smart Reorder on them, since you can't automatically restore playlists to their original order if you end up not liking the changes after saving them. To duplicate a Spotify playlist, open the playlist and tap the three-dots button above the list of songs. Select Add to other playlist > New playlist, then add a name for the copy and and tap Create.\n\nThis is another example of Spotify doing more with its AI DJ feature than Apple Music, where the AutoMix AI DJ feature has been more of a mixed bag for me. At the moment, AutoMix just handles song transitions, and Apple hasn't added any kind of custom playlist reordering to it.",

    "title": "Five Ways Unscrupulous Home Sellers Can Trick You",
    "description": "When someone is desperate to sell their home, there are a lot of dirty tricks they can play.",
    "fullText": "When selling a home, it’s natural for folks to want to get as much money as possible for their property. That’s why people often put money into repairs and upgrades right before listing their house, and why people hire stagers to make the place look its best. But not all home-selling tactics are above board: Some unscrupulous home sellers resort to dirty tricks to convince you to overpay for their homes. Here are some of the tricks you should watch for on your next open-house tour.\n\nA key consideration when buying a home is the condition and age of everything in it, and unscrupulous home sellers might try to hide how old their stuff actually is in order to avoid giving you a credit or being forced to replace aging infrastructure like the furnace or HVAC system. They can always claim they don’t know when something was installed and try to dance around the units’ actual ages, but, typically, a competent home inspector can take one look at the serial number on every appliance and determine when it was manufactured and likely installed.\n\nWhich is why some home sellers might try to deter this by simply removing serial number stickers or plates from appliances, or scratching them to make them unreadable. Sometimes they might even use a marker to try to change installation dates, if they’re marked on the unit. If you can’t easily locate and read the serial numbers on appliances, be suspicious at the very least and insist on finding out how old the units actually are.\n\nMost people aren’t experts in kitchen appliances, but most people are aware of the hierarchy of brands, and that certain brands—like Viking—are extremely expensive and high-end. So if you walk into a kitchen and the shiny, stainless-steel appliances have Viking badges on them, you might be thrilled to think you’re about to buy the most luxurious kitchen you’ve ever had. You might even be okay with paying a bit more if the appliances are included.\n\nAnd it might be a ruse. You can actually buy appliance badges for brands like Viking online, adhere them on your mid-range appliances (covering or removing the real emblem), and hope buyers don’t know what the actual high-end models look like. This obviously won’t work on anyone who knows their way around appliances (or who has used high-end models in the past), but for a few bucks, it’s an easy way to make a kitchen look way more upgraded than it is. It’s only slightly less terrible than folks who leave brand-new appliances in place for the open house, then swap them for old, beat-up versions after closing—taking the good stuff with them.\n\nAppliances can make or break a kitchen—and a sale price. A kitchen that looks new and recently remodeled can boost the sale price of a house significantly. This inspires some cash-strapped sellers to try to make the kitchen look as new as possible with some cheap tricks.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with sprucing up a tired old kitchen using some of these techniques, of course—as long as you’re open about it. It becomes problematic when a seller lets you assume things are newer and in better condition than they are and does nothing to disabuse you of the notion. A few common tricks include:\n\nFake stainless steel. People love the look of stainless steel, and tend to assume that stainless steel appliances are higher-end than white or black versions. It’s pretty easy and cheap to apply decals, contact paper, or vinyl wrap that will give an appliance a stainless steel look, making it just as easy for a buyer to assume those shiny appliances are newer and higher-end than they really are. Always check serial numbers—and be wary if they’re obscured or missing.\n\nUpgraded oven grates, knobs, and hardware. Combined with a stainless steel decal, swapping out old, crusty burner grates for fancier new ones and replacing plastic knobs with metal versions can make an old oven look brand new. Again: If disclosed, there’s nothing wrong with this.\n\nDishwasher cabinet panel. One easy way to obscure the condition of an old dishwasher is to add a cabinet panel that matches the rest of the cabinetry. This gives it a high-end, built-in look that might cause buyers to overlook the actual age and functionality of the appliance. This can be a DIY job for anyone who’s reasonably handy—and might even be considered a nice upgrade, as long as you know what’s lurking beneath that panel.\n\nEveryone does some work to get a house ready for sale. Deep cleaning, fresh paint, and necessary repairs get done shortly before the listing goes live so the house looks its best and looks well-maintained. But sometimes those necessary repairs are hiding a chronic problem the seller is hoping no one will notice because they’ve fixed it “for now” and covered up the damage.\n\nThe tell-tale sign is an isolated upgrade—a single wall painted in a room, a spot of new shingle on the roof, brand new carpet in the third bedroom but nowhere else, for example. A single, lonely upgrade or renovation, no matter how nicely done, might be a sign that something happened in that spot that the seller doesn’t want you to know about. At the very least, isolated upgrades should be pointed out to your home inspector for extra attention.\n\nAnother way home sellers try to trick potential buyers and hide problems is probably the oldest trick in the book: Simply hiding the problem under something else. If the house is being shown furnished and possibly staged, the clutter and interior design can distract you from checking out the bones of the place—and, after all, we don’t often move furniture around when checking out an open house. A few common tricks to watch for include:\n\nOddly-placed furniture. If a room has way too much furniture in it, or the couches and chairs are placed in strange ways that make the room uncomfortable, it’s time to look underneath and behind to see if there’s damage to walls and floors the seller doesn’t want you to see.\n\nFor-show drapes and curtains. If you see voluminous, floor-to-ceiling drapes and curtains in a room, pause to ask yourself if there’s actually a window behind them. They may have been added to hide a water-damaged wall or other problem.\n\nBrand new area rug or carpet. If there’s a brand-new area rug or carpet in one area of the house but the flooring is tired and worn everywhere else, take a peek under it, if you can. It may have been added to quickly hide a problem.\n\nDoor propping. Did the seller helpfully prop open all the doors so you could move freely through the open house? That’s nice. Now remove the doorstops and make sure the doors actually close properly.\n\nThe freshest air. Making a house smell nice is an old technique when selling a home. A fresh batch of cookies or a quick airing-out is fine, of course, but if the house smells like someone splashed a gallon of Febreze everywhere they might be hiding an ominous smell—like mold, or cigarette smoke.",

    "fullText": "Another significant winter storm is in the forecast — this time for early March, forecasters said.\n\n\"Fresh Arctic air will set the stage for a storm early next week that could bring disruptive snow and ice to parts of the Midwest and Northeast,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski in an online forecast.\n\nHowever, \"before the bigger storm threat arrives, smaller wintry events will move through the regions,\" he said.\n\nFollowing a minor event Thursday, Feb. 26, a narrow swath of snow is then forecast to develop Friday, Feb. 27 into Saturday night, Feb. 28 ahead of a surge of Arctic air plunging southeastward from Canada, AccuWeather said.\n\nThe snow will begin in Montana Friday, Feb. 27, spread into the Midwest Friday night and reach the interior Northeast Saturday night, Feb. 28. Most areas will pick up a coating to a couple of inches, Sosnowski said.\n\nChicago, Minneapolis and Detroit may pick up an inch or so from Friday night to Saturday night.\n\nA key ingredient in major winter storms is fresh cold air — and next week’s system will have plenty in place.\n\nWith fresh Arctic air in place, warm and moist air colliding with the cold air may produce widespread snow, sleet and freezing rain across parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast.\n\nThe National Weather Service said that \"while this is not expected to be a blockbuster storm, it does seem probable that plowable snow and some ice will occur. Snow is currently expected across portions of the Mid-Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic.\"\n\n\"Just to the south, this pattern will also favor a swath of mixed precipitation like sleet and freezing rain. Accumulations and track of the wintry weather remain uncertain, so continue to monitor forecasts,\" the weather service said.\n\nSnow and ice totals will depend on the storm’s track and strength, AccuWeather said. \"Some areas that missed the recent Blizzard of 2026 could receive several inches of snow and/or some ice this time,\" Sosnowski said.\n\nThis storm is highly unlikely to rival the blizzard from February, especially across the coastal Northeast. However, some areas that got little or no snow from that storm in the Northeast or Midwest could pick up several inches of snow and/or some ice, AccuWeather said.\n\nThe risk of travel disruptions will increase from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4, depending on the storm’s exact track and strength. Major airport hubs from Washington, DC, and Philadelphia to New York City, Boston, Detroit and Chicago could be affected.\n\nWhere rain falls, most likely in parts of the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic states, urban flooding is possible. A farther north track could elevate the risk of ice jams and related stream and river flooding, AccuWeather warned.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Early March forecast warns Northeast of another snowstorm",

This is the first time Hillary has had to answer real questions about Epstein. Clinton does not look happy. Photo provided by Rep.

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) reportedly rejected the request.\n\nIn her opening statement on Thursday, Clinton shredded House Republicans of the committee for their handling of the Epstein case.\n\nShe also denied any association with Epstein and claimed to have never visited his private islands or any of his other residences.\n\nHer husband, former President Bill Clinton, is slated to sit for a deposition of his own on Friday.\n\nThis is a developing story and has been updated.\n\nThe post JUST IN: Hillary Clinton Deposition Paused After Lauren Boebert Leaks Photo to Benny Johnson first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Home favourite and two-time champion Mark Williams is out of the Welsh Open after losing to Barry Hawkins.\n\nWilliams, who had sailed into the last 16 with an impressive 4-1 win over Martin O'Donnell, took a 2-1 lead, producing his highest break of the tournament (115) in the second frame.\n\nA key moment came in the fifth in which Williams would have gone 3-2 up, only for the white to go in off the middle pocket.\n\nEngland's Hawkins, the 2018 runner-up, took the opportunity to clear the table before winning the sixth frame with a break of 84 to seal victory.\n\nJak Jones and Jackson Page followed Williams out of the Llandudno tournament on Thursday, which means there is no more Welsh involvement this year.\n\n\"I thought it was a good match, we both played really well,\" Williams told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"I made some great breaks and just a little bit of luck in the last couple of frames decided the way it went.\n\n\"It's fine margins at this high level and I was just a little bit unlucky today.\"\n\nWelsh Open snooker: Results, schedule & how to follow\n\nWelsh Open 'should be in south Wales, 100%' - Page\n\nHawkins will meet another two-time champion, Neil Robertson, in the last eight after the Australian edged Welshman Jones 4-3.\n\nJones had made a flying start with a 126 break, before Robertson responded in kind with a 122 break.\n\nWith the match later tied at 3-3, Robertson came out on top of the deciding seventh frame to claim victory.\n\nJones' exit left Page as the only Welsh hope, but he was beaten by Jack Lisowski who amassed breaks of 67, 84, 99 and 54 in a convincing 4-2 victory.\n\nLisowski will be hoping his tournament form continues when he takes on fellow Englishman and 2017 champion Stuart Bingham, who beat Chinese world champion Zhao Xintong 4-2.\n\nJohn Higgins remains on course for a sixth Welsh Open title after defeating Zhang Anda 4-2.\n\nThe Scot recovered from dropping the opening frame by amassing 95, 78 and 60 breaks.\n\nChina's Anda responded with a century, before Higgins sealed the match with a superb 144 break, narrowly missing the maximum 147.\n\nHiggins will face the winner of China's Zhou Yuelong and England's Sam Craigie for a place in the semi-finals.\n\nMeanwhile there will be an all-Chinese quarter-final between Jiang Jun and Wu Yize, who both saw off English opposition.\n\nJun claimed an impressive 4-1 victory over Robbie Williams, while Yize made three breaks of 70 plus and a century to ease past David Grace 4-0.\n\nMark Williams 2-4 Barry Hawkins\n\nStuart Bingham 4-2 Zhao Xintong\n\nMonday, 23 February-Sunday, 1 March",

    "fullText": "The Premier League will launch its own streaming service in Singapore next season - and is looking to see how it could be \"replicated all around the world\".\n\nThe Netflix-style app, which will be named Premier League Plus, will allow users to watch all 380 matches of the season, as well as other content.\n\nIt is a departure from the way games have traditionally been broadcast with rights packages sold to broadcasters, although it will not affect current deals such as those in place with Sky Sports and TNT Sports in the UK.\n\nA number of other sporting organisations have already set up similar streaming platforms including the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball in North America, as well as Formula 1.\n\nPremier League chief executive Richard Masters announced the service, previously mooted as \"Premflix\", at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London on Thursday and said it followed \"a very long, considered process\".\n\nMasters said: \"For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers.\n\n\"This is a new app you can download and have on your smart TVs, your laptops, and watch 380 matches and loads of shoulder content, 24/7 channel service and it's going to be an exciting product.\n\n\"We're also looking to learn, to see how that might be replicated all around the world.\"\n\nMasters added \"if it goes well, it may be replicated\" but did not \"want to predict further than that\" at this stage.\n\nThe launch will coincide with the opening of a new Premier League Studios production hub in Olympia in London.\n\nTraditional broadcast rights have been a highly lucrative source of revenue for the league, with the current domestic package split between Sky and TNT worth a record £6.7bn.\n\nHowever, offering action to fans directly through their own subscription-based platforms opens up the opportunity for organisations to have greater control over the distribution of content, and potentially take in more revenue.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "Richard Collier-Keywood says dropping to three teams is the only way to ensure a sustainable future.",
    "fullText": "The chair of the Welsh Rugby Union has warned the Welsh Parliament that proposals to remove him and change the sport's governance would be a \"step backwards\" for the game.\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of the WRU was called by member clubs on Sunday amid turmoil over plans to cut the number of professional sides from four to three.\n\nRichard Collier-Keywood also admitted that the WRU had struggled to bring the professional sides on board.\n\nHe said there was no \"plan B\" for professional rugby if he were to lose the proposed vote of confidence in his leadership, maintaining that moving to three teams was the only way to ensure rugby in Wales is sustainable.\n\nCollier-Keywood, senior independent director Alison Thorne and director of the community game Geraint John appeared before the Senedd's sport and culture committee on Thursday.\n\nIn robust exchanges Collier-Keywood defended the union's plans, and suggested no decision had yet been made on which team would play in west Wales.\n\n\"I was brought in as an independent chair on a mandate of change,\" he told the committee.\n\n\"Change is never easy, we recognise, and we are in the midst of significant change.\n\n\"My mandate was change and I think we are in the course of delivering that change.\n\n\"We recognise that is very painful but we are committed to delivering that change. You didn't ask me to retain the status quo.\"\n\nOn the union's plans he added: \"Am I inclined to throw that away two months into its implementation?\n\n\"Honestly, probably not, because I think you asked me to bring this change so that Welsh rugby would have a strong, proud sustainable future, and we've just started that process.\"\n\nAsked by committee chair Delyth Jewell what message he had for fans if the EGM proposals were to be voted through, Collier-Keywood said \"it really feels like a step backwards\".\n\nHe added: \"We have professionalised governance, and it would be a totally backward step if you effectively reverse the changes that took place in March 2023\", a time at which the WRU made changes to its board.\n\nCentral Glamorgan Rugby Union, the Welsh district that have been the drivers behind the EGM, have previously stated they are not trying to reverse the governance changes from three years ago.\n\nCollier-Keywood also suggested that \"no decisions\" had been made as to which team would play in the west of Wales, although supporters and players at Ospreys feel their side is most likely to be cut, especially as Ospreys owners Y11 are in talks with the WRU to buy rivals Cardiff.\n\nHe told the committee: \"The assumption was that Ospreys was going to be the club that was killed off.\n\n\"That is not the case in terms of what will necessarily happen as a result of Y11 owning two clubs.\n\n\"There is a totally separate process the WRU are going through of how we decide to award the licences.\n\n\"Going forward I expect that we will carry out a fair and transparent process to determine who gets that licence. We have not done that yet.\n\n\"We will carry out that process because there may be some conditions we will put into that licence about where rugby needs to be played.\"\n\nSupporters of the side - based in Swansea, but playing this season in Bridgend - have demonstrated against the plans.\n\nHe was accused by committee member Alun Davies of living in a \"parallel universe\" if he thought Scarlets supporters would cross the river Loughor to watch their rugby, or that people in Bridgend or Swansea would watch the Scarlets play in Swansea.\n\nLater in the session he admitted that it was a \"fair reflection\" that the WRU had \"really struggled to bring the professional clubs with us on this journey.\"\n\nThorne accepted that some people were angry, but told the committtee: \"there's also a very strong number of clubs who don't feel like that. And so when we're in the districts, we hear both sides of those elements.\"\n\nThe WRU maintains that the only way for Welsh professional rugby to remain competitive and to be able to fund other parts of the sport such as a national academy and coach development programmes is to cut the number of teams.\n\nCollier-Keywood said that the WRU and the current sides were did not have the finances to be competitive because the cash and the player-base was spread too thinly.\n\nA date for the EGM is yet to be confirmed.\n\nWales' next Six Nations match is in Dublin against Ireland a week on Friday.\n\nGareth Griffiths, BBC Sport Wales rugby reporter\n\nThis was the second successive month we have seen Richard Collier-Keywood in front of Welsh politicians after his appearance at Parliament in January with WRU chief executive Abi Tierney.\n\nThe message today was clear from him. The WRU are not considering a change in the controversial policy of cutting a Welsh men's professional side.\n\nHe stated they have no plan B with the emphasis over the hour they are continuing to double down on plan A as Collier-Keywood proved robust in his defence of the three-team policy.\n\nHe insisted he had been brought in create change and not maintain the status quo.\n\nThe language about the impending EGM has softened slightly with Collier-Keywood calling it today \"a step backwards\" if the motions were passed, including the vote of no-confidence in himself. Compared with it being described as a \"nuclear option\" last month.\n\nHe also tried to reassure Ospreys fans a decision has not been made on its future as the professional team being culled, although they should still be concerned.\n\nThe WRU are trying to put out fires to get to their end goal.\n\nCollier-Keywood was not present at the Senedd today and appeared via video link because he is involved in London with the WRU's case with the Scarlets, who have taken legal action against Welsh rugby's governing body over the handling of their takeover of Cardiff in April 2025.\n\nThen there is the battle with Swansea Council, who were rarely mentioned today.\n\nThey have sought a High Court injunction to stop the WRU doing a deal with Ospreys owners Y11 taking over Cardiff.\n\nSo there are some winners in Welsh rugby at the moment. The lawyers.\n\nCollier-Keywood not being present allowed him off the hook at times, with WRU community director Geraint John and board member Alison Thorne in the room in Cardiff Bay and some questions from politicians dragging on.\n\nSo we did not learn that much new today. It promises to be another few weeks, maybe months of twists and turns in the turbulent world of Welsh rugby.",

After retiring as a player, he took his first steps into coaching with Saracens.\n\nThe 50-year-old - whose son Owen rejoined the Premiership outfit last summer after a season in France with Racing 92 - took over as Ireland head coach in 2019 from Joe Schmidt, stepping up from an assistant role he took up in 2016.\n\nIn 2023, he led Ireland to a Six Nations Grand Slam and the championship title the following year.\n\nHe then turned his attention to the British and Irish Lions, guiding them to a 2-1 series victory over Australia last year, before returning to the Ireland role.\n\n\"Given Andy's close relationship with Saracens, the club looks forward to welcoming him to more home fixtures once the Six Nations Championship has concluded,\" the Saracens statement concluded.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have confirmed sacking Ruben Amorim could end up costing the club almost £16m.\n\nThe Portuguese was dismissed on 5 January following his public attack on the club's hierarchy after a 1-1 draw at Leeds the previous day.\n\nThe figure was released in a filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, a day after the club confirmed they had made a profit of £32.6m in their second-quarter results to 31 December 2025.\n\nListed as an \"event that occurred after the reporting period\", United confirmed an amortised fee of £6.3m - which related to the cost of getting Amorim to Old Trafford from Sporting in November 2024 - had been written off and a \"provision of £15.9m\" would be made, representing the highest amount United could be liable to pay Amorim and his coaching staff.\n\nIt is not explicitly stated in the submission what would trigger the highest payment but sources with an understanding of the situation have said it relates to future employment.\n\nMan Utd post profit but debt rises to £1.3bn\n\nTactics, transfers and turmoil - inside the fall of Amorim\n\nA 'normal guy' doing 'brilliant' things - Lammens on life at Man Utd\n\nAmorim is yet to speak publicly about his time at United and sources close to the 41-year-old have said there is no immediate likelihood of that changing.\n\nThe payment completes an expensive managerial experiment that ultimately ended badly.\n\nUnited confirmed in a similar filing on 27 November 2024 they were paying Sporting £11m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m.\n\nIt means the combined changes around Amorim could cost £37.3m.\n\nHis 14-month stint in charge was the shortest reign of a permanent manager at Old Trafford since David Moyes was sacked just eight months into his tenure in 2014.\n\nAmorim won 25 of his 63 games in charge, finishing 15th in the Premier League, United's worst performance since they were relegated in 1973-74.\n\nThey also lost the Europa League final, meaning they have no European football this season for only the second time since 1990.\n\nThis term, Amorim's team were embarrassed by League Two Grimsby, who beat them on penalties in the Carabao Cup second round.\n\nUnited were sixth in the Premier League when he was dismissed, having had a major fallout with director of football Jason Wilcox days before the Leeds game.\n\nAlthough under-18s coach and former United midfielder Darren Fletcher was named as interim boss for two games, Michael Carrick has been given the job until the end of the season and won his fifth game out of six when his team beat Everton on Monday.\n\nThey are now fourth, and well placed to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nMeanwhile, United have also confirmed they have increased the available credit from their drawdown facility by £50m to £400m, while also paying off £75m, meaning they currently owe £215m on it.\n\nIn addition, the filing also stated £600,000-worth of \"sponsorship services\" had been provided to Ineos Automotive Ltd, an offshoot of the Ineos group owned by United's minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Tries: Keighran, French, Field 2, Smith 2, Eckersley, Nsemba, Forber Goals: Keighran 9\n\nWigan Warriors ran in nine tries to hammer local rivals Leigh Leopards 54-0 and continue their impressive start to the 2026 Super League season.\n\nTries from Adam Keighran, Bevan French, Jai Field and Harry Smith put Wigan into a dominant 24-point lead at half-time for the second match in a row.\n\nFurther tries from Field and Smith plus one each from Zach Eckersley, Junior Nsemba and Tom Forber after the break - as well as nine goals from Keighran on a perfect night with the boot - ensured a third league win from three for Warriors.\n\nLeigh failed to show up during a very one-sided 'Battle of the Borough' on a disappointing night for the visitors littered with handling errors and a lack of discipline.\n\nWigan went ahead after 10 minutes - French fired in a short pass for Keighran to cross over from close range on the last tackle after Leigh's Lachlan Lam conceded a set of six in his own half for a late shot.\n\nLiam Marshall dotted down for Warriors soon after but the celebrations were cut short as referee Liam Moore spotted a forward pass from French in the build-up of a flowing team move.\n\nFrench then found a small gap in the Leigh backline on the right edge to roll challenges from Lam and Tesi Niu to grab Wigan's second in a dominant opening 20 minutes from the hosts.\n\nA well-measured kick from Smith was batted back one-handed by Nsemba to full-back Field who showed a dummy before darting over for the impressive Warriors' third try.\n\nField turned from scorer to provider moments later, finding room in midfield before setting up Smith to dot down underneath the sticks and, after Keighran dispatched a fourth successful kick, the game was effectively over as a contest by the half-hour mark.\n\nMoments into the second period, Leigh's Matt Davis was forced off with a head injury having taken the full force of a kick to the corner by Smith.\n\nAnd Warriors stretched their legs soon after when a beautiful line break from Patrick Mago allowed the prop to pass to Smith, who unselfishly found Field to finish another free-flowing move for his second of the night.\n\nAt this stage, Wigan were playing exhibition rugby league and a miss-out pass from French cut out three Leigh defenders and found Eckersley who strolled in for Wigan's sixth try.\n\nNsemba then got his name on the scoresheet, getting on the end of a delicate grubber kick from Smith, before Field raced away on a wonderful break and found the supporting Smith to dive over next to the sticks.\n\nHooker Forber got 50-up for Warriors, barging over for his side's ninth try between the sticks before Keighran added the extras once more to seal a perfect night for Wigan.\n\nLeigh were dealt a further blow with just a minute remaining as full-back Bailey Hodgson had to be helped off the field with a serious looking knee injury.\n\nWigan boss Matt Peet told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"It's hard to know what level the other teams are at. Hull were missing a few [players] last week, Leigh were missing a few [players], so it's important we don't get carried away at this stage of the season.\n\n\"The boys have got themselves in outstanding physical shape, credit to our performance staff - we were ready for this season physically.\n\n\"We've got ability - the game has quickened up a bit so we can show it.\"\n\nLeigh boss Adrian Lam told BBC Radio Manchester:\n\n\"Obviously terrible. That is probably as bad as we've played in my time here and I think we were our own worst enemies.\n\n\"We gave away a tackle six penalty when the score was 0-0 and that certainly turned the game completely on its head.\n\n\"You've got to come here and win possession and not do those things [mistakes] so it put us under pressure and it just escalated from there.\n\n\"You just can't give away those simple errors and penalties early on. We got beaten up a little bit - no doubt about it.\"\n\nWigan: Field; Eckersley, Keighran, Farrell, Marshall; French, Smith; Havard, O'Neill, Thompson, Nsemba, Walters, Ellis.\n\nReplacements: Mago, Partington, Eseh, Forber.\n\nLeigh: Hodgson; Senior, Niu, Brand, Charnley; Cook, Lam; Ofahengaue, Horne, Mulhern, Halton, Trout, Liu.\n\nReplacements: Hughes, Davis, Alick-Wiencke, O'Brien.",

    "fullText": "Key players have gone, the manager is leaving and has criticised the club and upset fans - yet Crystal Palace's chaotic campaign could still end in European glory.\n\nIt has been a wild 12 months for the Eagles, who have found themselves in the headlines on an almost daily basis.\n\n\"I don't know what all the fuss was about,\" joked captain Dean Henderson shortly after they gained a 2-0 win over Bosnian side Zrinjski to seal a 3-1 aggregate victory and reach the last 16 of the Conference League.\n\nIt has been an emotional rollercoaster for Palace supporters.\n\nIn May they won their first major trophy, beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup, then added another three months later with a penalty shootout win over Liverpool to clinch the Community Shield.\n\nBut winger Eberechi Eze left for Arsenal, skipper Marc Guehi nearly joined Liverpool, then moved to Manchester City five months later and top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta was on the verge of signing for AC Milan, only to fail a medical.\n\nOliver Glasner, the most successful manager in the club's history, then announced in January he was leaving at the end of the season, before telling the club's board they had \"abandoned\" the squad.\n\nThat appeared to be the end of his tenure, but he has stayed, though fans held up a banner on Sunday before the 1-0 win over Wolves saying he was \"finished\".\n\nAsked if he had assurance of his job from his bosses, Glasner said \"100%\", adding: \"There's so much noise, sometimes you really don't understand it. Maybe I gave some interviews that were not helpful and I have to admit that, but I'm always telling what I'm feeling, it's how I am.\n\n\"We're in a very good position in the league and the Conference League and it is up to us to make a really great season of it.\"\n\nPalace are 13th in the Premier League, but 10 points clear of the relegation zone and only three away from eighth, which could be a position high enough to secure a European return next season.\n\nFor Glasner, he says the way the players are still performing for him is evidence that his job is secure.\n\n\"If the players believe in me and the staff, that's the most important thing, otherwise, you can pack your suitcase and go home because the players have to perform on the pitch,\" added the Austrian.\n\n\"We have a great togetherness in the group - players, staff, really positive. The same with the sporting director and the chairman. They are sometimes wondering, 'Hey, this is the second-best Premier League season ever'.\n\n\"The best was last year. So maybe the best two years in Crystal Palace's history, playing European football for the first time.\"\n\nPalace see off Zrinjski to reach Conference League last 16\n\nThe Conference League, Europe's third-tier competition, is only in its fifth season, with two English sides - West Ham in 2023 and Chelsea in 2025 - among its first four winners.\n\nFrom the start of this season's edition Palace have been the bookmakers' favourites, even though they only finished 10th in the league phase and had to go through two matches against Bosnian champions Zrinjski to get into the last 16.\n\nBut there are not many clubs in the competition Palace will fear.\n\nThey will find out on Friday whether they play German side Mainz, a team 13th in the Bundesliga, or Cypriot side Larnaca, who only scored seven goals in six league phase matches, though they did beat Palace 1-0 in October.\n\n\"We're hungry for more [silverware] but you don't talk about winning it three months out,\" added goalkeeper Henderson, who became Palace captain after Guehi left the club.\n\n\"It's knockout football and we go into it with confidence. You see the supporters get into the stadium early and Selhurst was rocking tonight and we can make it a fortress.\"\n\nFormer Palace defender James Tomkins, speaking on TNT Sports, said: \"They go through to the next stage, into the last 16 of this competition and they are favourites to go on and win it from here.\n\n\"They've got to concentrate on the Conference League. The opportunity they've got is incredible. To add a third trophy in two seasons would be remarkable and beyond the wildest dreams of the fans.\n\n\"They needed a second goal to get over the line and it's a great night for the club. The atmosphere is amazing and you can see all the fans are behind the team and the manager and it means a lot.\"\n\nGlasner, whose side have now gained two successive victories after a 12-game run from December without a win, felt the club were in a good position to push on and end the season well.\n\n\"It means a lot. We have not had easy days but now back-to-back wins at Selhurst Park,\" he added. \"Everybody was expecting a win and they are the most difficult ones.\n\n\"Since day one we have had a great relationship with the fans. Yes, they have been a bit critical but they can be when the results and performances are not there.\n\n\"But we are in a good position in the Premier League, three points behind position eight, and in the last 16 of the Conference League.\n\n\"Now it is different to the autumn when we were playing three competitions, 12 weeks playing every third day.\"\n\nWith the club's injury problems easing and with Mateta along with key midfielder Jefferson Lerma expected back in two weeks, hopes will be rising among Palace fans that the most chaotic of seasons could end in more record-breaking glory and a first European trophy.\n\nLatest Crystal Palace news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Crystal Palace - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "After exiting the Europa League, Celtic face a season-defining fortnight in the fight for the league and Scottish Cup.",
    "fullText": "With the Europa League behind them, Celtic now face a season-defining fortnight.\n\nOr they could be further toiling to defend their title and staring at a trophyless campaign.\n\nThe first stop is Ibrox on Sunday for a titanic league match, with Celtic trailing Rangers by two points having played one game fewer, with Hearts six clear of the champions.\n\nThen it is a midweek trip to Aberdeen, before returning to Ibrox in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and then hosting in-form and formidable Motherwell.\n\nSix of their next seven matches are away from Celtic Park. This much-maligned Celtic squad is about to be stress-tested after a tumultuous first two-thirds of the season.\n\n\"There will be a lot of twists and turns,\" former Celtic defender Johann Mjallby said on TNT Sports after the 1-0 victory over Stuttgart.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if the league goes to the final day. But they will have to do it over the next five or six games. You have to be relentless, otherwise they won't take the trophies.\"\n\nSportsound: Celtic bow out despite historic night\n\nDespite the 1-0 win over Stuttgart proving moot in Celtic's quest to reach the last 16 of the Europa League after a 4-1 home loss, it could yet prove significant.\n\nMartin O'Neill changed eight of his starting line-up and some of the fringe players put in eye-catching displays to secure the club's first ever win in Germany against the side fourth in the Bundesliga.\n\nLuke McCowan stroked home the winner after just 28 seconds and played positively, while in the back four Dane Murray, and Marcelo Sarrachi stood out in a gutsy display.\n\nMurray in particular made his case to start alongside Liam Scales with Auston Trusty suspended for the next three league games.\n\nOne magnificent block stood out and he was assured at defending corners.\n\nBut the most talked-about performance was saved for back-up goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo as he played his part in a first Celtic clean sheet in six matches.\n\nKasper Schmeichel, 39, has been under intense scrutiny after a series of errors, culminating in last week's slack performance in the home defeat by Stuttgart.\n\nThe 26-year-old from Finland stepped in and made six saves, in a display former Celtic midfielder Stiliyan Petrov described as \"perfect\".\n\nPat Bonner, the former Celtic goalkeeper, believes Sinisalo did enough to start against Rangers on Sunday.\n\n\"He had some very good saves and looked composed when he had the ball and read the game well,\" he said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound.\n\n\"It's a big decision for Martin O'Neill to make at the weekend. On that performance, I would be starting him. Give him a run in the team now.\"\n\nThe Celtic manager agreed several players have given him \"food for thought\".\n\n\"[Sinisalo] played brilliantly in the game, really well. That's the name all round the dressing room,\" the 73-year-old said. \"He's got plenty of talent.\n\n\"Tonight, we made some changes. Some enforced, players stepped up to the plate but we didn't throw in 16-year-olds... these boys have played in the team and have shown they're capable of winning games.\n\n\"It wouldn't be a headache... A selection choice.\"\n\nThe other benefit of Celtic's win was that they showed they can grind out a victory.\n\nOver the years, Celtic have pitched up and naturally looked to dominate the ball from start to finish against every domestic opponent.\n\nBut this more fragile side had looked increasingly vulnerable in 2026, regularly conceding more than one goal per game.\n\nHaving not won at Ibrox in four attempts since September 2023 and given Rangers have won their past 10 home matches, a show of resilience in Stuttgart was timely.\n\nMight Celtic take a slightly more pragmatic approach? Right now, it is all about winning.\n\n\"You don't have to have all the possession to win the game,\" Bonner said on Sportsound.\n\n\"You've got to work hard, defend well, get a bit of luck and have a good goalkeeper.\n\n\"Celtic have not played well this season, but they are hanging in there [in the league]. They still have a chance, with a game in hand.\n\n\"The players will pick up great confidence from tonight - the weekend will be a critical one.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

India showed none as they bludgeoned their highest total at a T20 World Cup and passed 250 in a men's T20 international for the fifth time.\n\nSharma, who came into the match under pressure having registered three ducks in his past four innings, set the tone with a 26-ball half-century.\n\nInitially content to play second fiddle to Sanju Samson, who struck the second ball of the match for six and made a quickfire 24 from 15 deliveries, he led India to 80-1 at the end of the powerplay, striking three fours and three sixes.\n\nHis second-wicket partnership with Ishan Kishan (38) was worth 72 runs and although Kishan could not capitalise on Tashinga Musekiwa dropping him on 26, Suryakumar Yadav punished Zimbabwe's sloppy fielding. Dropped on eight by Blessing Muzarabani, the India skipper thrashed 33 from 13 deliveries.\n\nIt was Zimbabwe's fifth drop from 15 attempts in the Super 8s. In the group stage, during which they were unbeaten, they had a catching efficiency of 95.2% and dropped just one.\n\nThough Suryakumar was striking above 250, his departure flicked a switch for India, with Hardik and Varma piling on 84 runs in the final 5.1 overs, including seven sixes. Hardik accelerated from 12 from eight balls to 50 not out from 23, while Varma found the boundary seven times in 16 deliveries.\n\nOn a bruising day, Zimbabwe's four pace bowlers leaked 3-197 from 14 overs.\n\nWho needs what to reach T20 World Cup semi-finals?\n\nIndia overpower Zimbabwe despite Bennett's 97 not out - as it happened\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Eleven years ago, a young Harry Westlake went viral.\n\nAfter winning a competition to be an England mascot, he spent the days running up to England's meeting with Italy learning the words to the national anthem.\n\nStanding in front of then England captain Chris Robshaw, the six-year-old certainly took his chance.\n\nFist clenched over his heart, Westlake belted out God Save the Queen with such gusto, that images were shared widely across the internet, spawning a hashtag #DoItLikeHarry.\n\nA couple of days later, a little more tired and quiet, Harry was interviewed on BBC Breakfast. Midway through the chat, presenter Naga Munchetty asked him: \"One day will we see you on the pitch singing as one of the players?\"\n\nNow 17, Westlake has been included in an England training camp in preparation for a warm-up match against France next month and April's U18 Six Nations Festival in Vichy, France.\n\n\"England Rugby was always a massive thing for me growing up,\" says Westlake, looking back.\n\n\"I just loved England and I'm very patriotic.\n\n\"I remember getting into the tunnel and asking Chris Robshaw if he was ready.\n\n\"Then we cracked on, went out and I think I thought I was going to play!\n\n\"You see me walking out and almost staring everyone down.\n\n\"Before it, my mum had said to me, 'Make sure you sing it loud and sing it proud'.\n\n\"So I just thought, 'All right, I'll do that'.\"\n\nWestlake was playing for Devonport Services under-7s at the time, but already had his eyes on the big stage, with plans to become England fly-half or centre.\n\nThat part probably won't come to pass.\n\nWestlake, who plays in Exeter's academy, is now a hard-running back row, channelling the energy and drive of Ben Earl and Henry Pollock, even if he does cite childhood hero Owen Farrell as the embodiment of the mentality he aspires to.\n\nWestlake has already had to show resilience to keep pursuing his dream.\n\n\"Rugby has always been the focus, even if the ride hasn't necessarily been as smooth as it could have been,\" he says.\n\nWestlake has Crohn's disease, a chronic gut inflammation.\n\n\"I'm on medication which I take every eight weeks, which sort of ticks me over and gets me through,\" he explains.\n\n\"There was a two, three, four-year period where it was pretty tough, but we're getting through it now.\n\n\"It affects energy levels so for two or three days before my medication is due, I'll struggle and then a day after I'll struggle as well.\"\n\nHarry's anthem moment was not his even his first experience meeting the England squad.\n\nAfter using an image of Harry on father Kevin's shoulders at a match the previous year in publicity material, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) had brought both into the team hotel to meet the players and coach Stuart Lancaster.\n\nAfter his viral rendition of the anthem, Harry, decked out in a black suit, even hosted his own online mini chat show, external with England internationals Dylan Hartley, Luther Burrell and Kieran Brookes as guests.\n\nAre any of his new age-grade team-mates aware of his brief childhood burst of rugby fame?\n\n\"The core group of friends I have now, I've been friends with since I was about six, seven, eight anyway,\" says Westlake. \"So they all know and share the clips - it gets around.\n\n\"But no, I don't think any of the England Under-18s know about it yet.\"\n\nIf they haven't seen the recorded version, Westlake is determined they get to hear him sing live.\n\n\"I'd love to be playing in a [senior] England shirt in five years' time,\" he says.\n\n\"I think that's everyone's goal who's in this camp at the minute to progress through the pathway and become an England player eventually.\n\n\"I've already thought about the anthem. If I get the chance, then definitely I'll give it some - 100%.\"\n\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",
